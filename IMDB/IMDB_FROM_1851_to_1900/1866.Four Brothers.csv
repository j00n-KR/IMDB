0,bkoganbing,The Foster Sons of Mrs. Mercer,8,10 June 2007,"I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with how well the plot of the John Wayne classic western, The Sons of Katie Elder, was adopted to modern day Detroit. In the original film, Katie Elder is never seen, the sons arrive in Sweetwater, Texas for her funeral and find out about their dad Bass Elder who was an unsolved homicide. In this film Fionnula Flannagan has the mother role in the very beginning and we see her gunned down in a convenience store holdup. Or was there more to it than that?You KNOW there's more to it than that and like John Wayne and his brothers, Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund are going to not let things rest until they find out. Wahlberg steps very nicely into a modern day version of the Duke and the others fill out the parts that were played by Dean Martin, Earl Holliman, and Michael Anderson, Jr. back in the day.It's modern day stuff, but the classic scenes from the westerns are nicely adapted. I do like the way the famous scene of the ambush of the Elder brothers is staged in modern Detroit. As those of us who remember the original, one of the brothers doesn't survive. I will say it's a poignantly played death scene.I do wonder if back in the days when Mark Wahlberg was a real life urban hoodlum in the making, did he have any idea he would be playing a John Wayne part on the silver screen? Life can take some funny turns.",Four Brothers
1,SnoopyStyle,Good actors in good enough action,7,2 November 2013,"Four adopted brothers (Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund) reunites when their mother gets shot in a convenient store holdup. Only they find that she may have been targeted. Terrence Howard and Josh Charles play cops, and watch out for Sofía Vergara as a loud girlfriend.The four guys have an easy flowing relations. They have the brotherly chemistry down. Once you get that, the movie is a lot more easy. The story is straight out of any action B-movie. It has a few too many coincidences, a few too many simplifications, and a few too many easy explanations. But John Singleton has given it enough energy to raise it above everyday violent thriller.",Four Brothers
2,Horst_In_Translation,Solid crime thriller (with some humor),6,31 October 2015,"""Four Brothers"" is a 108-minute movie from ten years ago that was written by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, both not really that prolific, but they did a good job here. Same can be said about director James Singleton, only that he has made films for many years, also back in 2005 already and scored two Oscar nominations for ""Boyz n the Hood"" back in the early 90s. And just like in that one, the cast in this film we have here is predominantly black as well. However, there are exceptions such as Mark Wahlberg who plays the main character and the very young, truly unknown Garret Hedlund. Also in it are Tyrese Gibson, Chiwetel Ejiofor and André Benjamin. The latter is the singer from the pretty great band OutKast. He certainly held his own very well here against all these professional actors, which is especially impressive as his character is actually one of the biggest and most significant of the movie.The plot is as follows: An old lady gets killed during a store robbery and her four sons are out for revenge. They run into good and bad cops and the main antagonist who is surrounded by many henchmen and contract killers. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention Terrence Howard and Josh Charles (""The Good Wife"") earlier. They also play their parts very well. Do not look for realism or real greatness in this movie. It's a nice revenge tale, but it's not too realistic. Still this wasn't a problem for me as it was mostly a fun watch with nice character elaborations and an interesting story. The ending may be a bit too over the top in terms of how everything looked bad for the title characters, but they manage apparently easily to get out of this mess. Really solid watch and I recommend this movie. Quite a lot of talent in here and that does not only include the cast. Thumbs up.",Four Brothers
3,claudio_carvalho,They Could Not Bring Their Mother Back So They Send Their Killers to Meet Her,8,28 May 2006,"In Detroit, when the beloved citizen Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) is murdered in a store heist, her four dangerous stepsons come to her funeral. Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg), Angel Mercer (Tyrese Gibson) and Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund) join the regenerated ex-union leader Jeremiah Mercer (Andre Benjamin), and they decide to investigate the murder. They disclose that her execution was intentional, and resolve to find the criminals by themselves.""Four Brothers"" is an excellent tale of revenge. John Singleton triggers his shotgun everywhere, showing corruption in the Legislative Assembly and in the Police Force of Department of Detroit. This film is attractive since the very beginning and does not lose the pace. The sequence with the car chase in the snowy streets is amazingly perfect. The description of the dangerousness of each brother and why Evelyn adopted them is hilarious and gives an excellent introduction to the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Quatro Irmãos"" (""Four Brothers"")",Four Brothers

5,BA_Harrison,A turkey with all the trimmings!,2,31 March 2006,"In the same way that the titular 'four brothers' of this movie demand justice and attempt to bring down the bad guys, so I demand justice and attempt to bring down the ridiculously high rating (6.8) that this corny revenge actioner currently enjoys on IMDb.Mark Wahlberg turns in yet another dreadful performance as Bobby Mercer, one of four delinquents adopted by a saintly old woman. When she is killed in a store robbery, it is up to Bobby and his 'brothers' (played by Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund) to hunt down those responsible. Cue car chases, shootouts and punch-ups.What could have been a gritty tale of revenge is spoilt by ham-fisted direction from John Singleton, some awful performances and a terrible script loaded with stereotypes and clichés.There are so many reasons to hate this film, but if I have to choose the one that nailed it for me, it has to be the spectre of dear old Mom present at the Thanksgiving dinner. As this scene unfolds, I dare you not to feel embarrassed for all involved.",Four Brothers

9,preppy-3,Good revenge movie,7,1 April 2007,"In Detroit four adopted kids (played by Mark Wahlberg, Garrett Hedlund, Andre Benjamin and Tyrese Gibson) get together for their moms funeral. She was accidentally shot to death in what was just a robbery at a convenience story. But they begin to find out that her killing may have been more than just an accident and set out to find who killed her...and why.The script is nothing new but this is still a pretty good movie. The story gets a little overly convoluted but the numerous twists and turns keep you watching. Also making the brothers both black and white is a good idea--it adds more tension (racial and otherwise). The four actors also work well together and play off each other in a natural manner. There are bursts of loud and exciting action with extreme violence well directed by John Singleton.There are some problems however--the script has some TERRIBLE lines and has some unfunny comedy shoehorned in. Also Wahlberg is (surprisingly) terrible and he should never attempt comedy again--the man does not know how to be funny. The view of females here is also problematic--they're either screaming witches (Gibson's horribly stereotyped Latina girlfriend) or sex objects.Still, this is a good revenge film with a satisfying ending. Worth catching.",Four Brothers
10,LeonLouisRicci,Not Without Flaws but Feisty Street Level Revenge Flick,7,3 September 2014,"A Movie of Many Tones from Extreme Emotionalism to Visceral Outbursts of Street Level Violence, this Band of Brothers are a Racial and Sexual Orientation Mix of Odd Fellows in Detroit's Dead End Community of Working Class Misfits and Perpetually Falling Snow.Obviously, this has a Cold Feel to it Despite the Many inclusions of Family and Brotherly Love. There are some Missteps like the Basketball Game that comes off as Ludicrous. The Acting is Fine but the Latino Female Character and Her Constant Loud Mouth Yelling and Confrontations with the Brother are Grating and Over the Top.The Revenge Element is Handled with Reckless Abandon that Sometimes Works just Fine, Like the Scene in the Project with Attack Dogs and an Escape Attempt that is Bone Crushing. The Car Chase is Refreshingly Different, but Sometimes the Gun Wielding Swagger can be a Bit too Much to Take.Director John Singleton Seems to be on His Game here and is at Home with the Homeys. Mark Wahlberg doesn't Mumble Much but the Marbles in the Mouth are Evident in a Couple of Scenes. The Movie is an Above Average Character Study with Plenty of Action and a Goodly Amount of Thought.Overall a Winner for the Director and Wahlberg, but the Overrated Terrence Howard got most of the Awards and Critical Attention as a Cop with Connections to the Family. A Picture with a lot More Pathos than Most Movies of This Type. Uneven but Gritty and Violent Enough to Satisfy its Goal as a Deep Discussion on Environment and Noble Intentions Buried in a Storm of Chilling Reality.",Four Brothers

12,zardoz-13,"Not As Good As ""The Sons of Katie Elder""",5,20 June 2007,"""Boyz N the Hood"" director John Singleton's new movie ""Four Brothers"" looks a whole lot like a blaxploitation version of the vintage John Wayne & Dean Martin western ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965) with only half of its conspiracy plot but none of its larger-than-life panache. In this quasi-remake of sorts, Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garret Hedlund are convincing enough as the rough and tough title siblings in contemporary Detroit who take ""Death Wish"" style vigilante justice into their own hands to rub out the cold-blooded thugs that singled out their mom for execution during an otherwise routine convenience store hold-up. When Singleton isn't tipping his hat to classic western movies, he borrows blatantly from blaxploitation thrillers of the 1970s. For example, he introduces lead character Mark Wahlberg with the Marvin Gaye title tune from Ivan Dixon's blaxploitation actioneer ""Trouble Man"" (1972) starring Robert Hooks. At the same time, ""Four Brothers"" takes the idea of black and white foster brothers a step farther than the Wesley Snipes & Woody Harrelson thriller ""Money Train"" (1995) where Snipes and Harrelson played foster brothers competing for the attention of hot Hispanic actress Jennifer Lopez. Action-oriented moviegoers who prefer their melodramas loaded with bursts of staccato gunfire and ghetto profanity as well as careening auto chases will have a field day with this trigger-happy tough guy twaddle. A feisty, unshaven Wahlberg puts on a tougher act than usual as a revenge hungry hothead in need of anger management, while Tyrese Gibson struggles as much with the bad guys as he does with his fiery Latino girlfriend. If ""Boyz N the Hood"" and ""Baby Boy"" rank as Singleton's better movies, ""Four Brothers"" falls somewhere between the above-average but flawed ""Shaft"" (2000) with Samuel L. Jackson and hare-brained hokum like last summer's ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" with Paul Walker.Scenarists David (""The Watcher"") Elliot and first-timer Paul Lovett have cooked up a cliché-ridden but brutal mystery thriller that definitely needed a few more rewrites when you consider how lame some crucial scenes turn out. One major scene near the end about a corrupt cop unravels because the surprise reversal is simply too preposterous. Meanwhile, Elliot and Lovett have clearly appropriated the idea of four brothers getting to the bottom of the death of their mother from ""The Sons of Katie Elder,"" but most of the action resembles a blaxploitation shoot'em up with everybody but the heroes brandishing submachine guns. The action opens on a snowy evening in a corner grocery store where two thugs in woolen ski masks rob and murder an unarmed cashier then blast to bits an old woman, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan of ""Tears of the Sun""), at close range with an automatic shotgun. Naturally, everybody is stunned by this senseless violence, because Evelyn was the neighborhood do-gooder. As one cop explains to another during a moment of obvious exposition, Evelyn emerged as the patron saint of the inner city and rescued droves of at-risk delinquent children from lives of crimes. She found over 100 foster homes for these social misfits. When Evelyn couldn't find homes for Bobby (Mark Wahlberg of ""Boogie Nights""), Angel (Tyrese Gibson of ""Baby Boy""), Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund of ""Troy"") and Jeremiah Mercer (Andre Benjamin, better known as the lead singer for the hip-hop group Outkast), she raised them as her own. Jeremiah Mercer was the only brother who stayed behind in Detroit while rebellious Bobby went off and served time; Jack became a musician, and Angel joined the U.S. Marines. The Detroit detectives on the case, Lt. Green (Terrence Howard of ""Hustle & Flow"") and Sgt. Fowler (Josh Charles of ""Dead Poet's Society), believe that Evelyn died, because she wound up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Before the gunfire wanes and the blood coagulates, our eight-fisted heroes discover that her brutal killing was less spontaneous than the police say.African-American director John Singleton stages a fairly intense gun battle between an army of masked assassins and our protagonists when the latter are chilling at Evelyn's house. The only drawback to an otherwise blistering bullet ballet is that the henchmen waste their ammunition. They practically destroy the house, but they cannot hit anybody on the premises. When the Detroit Police finally arrive late as always, Lt. Green surveys the carnage and lets our heroes off far too easily, casually dismissing everything as 'self-defense.' Mind you, ""Four Brothers"" never wears out its welcome, thanks to its fast pace, gritty dialogue, and shoot first, ask questions later approach. The thing that made the John Wayne & Dean Martin opus ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" so memorable was that the villains kept crowding the Elders into one corner after another that the heroes found steadily harder to escape. Things kept getting more precarious for John Wayne and Dean Martin, so they had to think their way out of danger. The Elders spent most of their time fighting on defense. The heroes in ""Four Brothers"" have things a lot easier, striking more often on the offensive against the villains, though one of the four bites the asphalt before fade-out. Nonetheless, they never wind up as badly behind the 8-ball or as desperate for help as the brothers in ""The Sons of Katie Elder."" Moreover, while the heroes in ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" treated violence as a last resort, the ""Four Brothers"" adopt violence as the first resort. Literally, they fight fire with fire and show little reluctance to abide by the law. Neither the city of Detroit nor the Detroit Police Department catch a break, especially in the last scene when our heroes survive the beatings at the hands of the cops in the interrogation rooms. Despite a strong cast, invigorating action scenes and confined social commentary about saving the inner-city from drug dealers, ""Four Brothers"" suffers from far too many lapses in logic to qualify as anything more than an adequate way to alleviate an hour and forty-eight minutes.",Four Brothers

The foster mother of four misfits gets murdered and the four brothers take it upon themselves to find the murderers and get revenge.The movie was truly enjoyable. The writers did a good job not making it an overly simplified seek-and-destroy type movie. Yes, the brothers (three of them in particular) were thirsty for blood, but they were equally thirsty for answers, with the main question being ""why"".Wahlberg (Bobby Mercer) was especially good, Andre Benjamin (Jerimiah Mercer) held his own, and Tyrese Gibson (Angel Mercer) and Garret Hedlund (Jack Mercer) were good enough in their supporting roles.

15,neil-476,Wahlberg = Wayne,8,11 April 2010,"Welcome to The Sons Of Katie Elder set in wintery Detroit.Mark Wahlberg plays an urban version of John Wayne's patriarchal oldest brother in a decent reimagination of the western in an updated setting. A nice wrinkle is added by having the brothers all adopted, two black and two white, and all bad kids rescued from ruin by the good hearted mother. The fact that these were bad kids in the first place means that it is not a huge step for them to take actions which are somewhat outside what we would normally expect the ""heroes"" to take. Having said that, there are few characters in here who are not morally compromised in this movie, and those who are morally sound mostly suffer bad fates.But this is a solid crime thriller, always intriguing, well acted, with solid emotional investment throughout, and some unexpected twists and turns.I enjoyed it greatly.",Four Brothers
16,anaconda-40658,Six Reasons to See It.,6,3 September 2015,"Four Brothers (2005): Dir: John Singleton / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund, Terrence Howard: Family is the theme of this film although vengeance certainly plays a factor as four adopted brothers (two white, two black) return home for their mother's funeral after she was murdered during a robbery. They seek justice and vengeance setting out to solve the case themselves. Unfortunately revenge seems to be the norm yet the screenplay details their search and establishes the bond that unites them. Directed by John Singleton who often makes films about urban society with violent undertones as he did with Baby Boy and Boyz N the Hood. Mark Wahlberg heads the cast returning with a bad reputation and a taste for vengeance. Tyrese Gibson is superb as the brother involved with a feisty Spanish woman. Andre Benjamin is a family and business person. Garrett Hedlund plays the gay brother seeking refuge in music. Their anger is understandable and their desire for justice seems to be a never ending plea even in reality but when revenge plays a factor a film risks the wrong sort of entertainment delivery and warps any potential message. Other roles are standard issue from the investigating cops warning the boys, to the villain who will get pummeled in due time. In the end this film is well made but its take on revenge sidelines a bond between brothers. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Four Brothers
17,gradyharp,Brotherhood and Revenge: A Study in Fighting Crime,8,27 December 2005,"John Singleton has a gift for depicting the gritty side of life and making it credible: there are reasons for heads-up defensive action in neighborhoods where perpetrators an victims live side by side in a world teetering on imbalance.FOUR BROTHERS is a finely tuned, taut little film that demonstrates the influence of a caring adult on kids with little future can impact lives. Evelyn Mercer (a terrific Fionnula Flanagan) is a single woman who adopted four orphans as children and raised them tightly bonded brothers: two are white (ex-con Bobby - Mark Wahlberg - and gay musician Jack - Garrett Hedlund: two are African American - (gentle Angel - Tyrese Gibson - and stay-at-home businessman Jeremiah - André Benjamin). The four brothers reunite when their mother is killed during a store holdup. Knowing that the Detroit police are a corrupt organization they take matters into their own hands, seeking out their mother's killers. Along the way they discover aspects of each other that draw them eventually even closer as brothers.The cast is excellent with fine cameo performances from Terrence Howard and Josh Charles as polar opposite policemen, from Flanagan (who though murdered in the first frames of the film reappears to 'spiritually' influence the brothers), Chiwetel Ejiofor as the bad guy, Tara P. Henson as Jeremiah's wife and Sofía Vergara as Angel's girlfriend. The story is solid if a bit predictable, but the messages are many about racism, brotherhood, family importance, and awareness of police corruption. Singleton directs with breakneck speed yet allows us time to get to know everyone in the story. This is a dandy action film with a heart. Grady Harp",Four Brothers
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Four Brothers,7,22 September 2005,"A kind old lady is murdered in cold blood one snowy night in a convenience store. It seemed like the usual stick up by racist hoodlums on the hard streets of Detriot, and that the lady was collateral damage.Four orphaned brothers of the hood are brought back together to mourn the loss of their foster mother. We see the Mercer brothers Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah and Jack, bond together as they try not to openly weep. But deep down inside, they know the police can't do much to help a covered-up investigation, and swear sweet revenge upon those involved in the killing.I was expecting loads of gun battles and intense action, but this movie surprised me with its witty moments instead. There weren't much wham-bang action, but the one which stood out was the ambush on the Mercer house, and the car chase sequence along frozen streets. The script was mildly intelligent with its weaving of the brothers' dalliances with the hoodlums, contract killers, government officers, and with crooked cops, bringing them all together for an interesting finale.The last Mark Wahlberg movie I saw was The Italian Job remake, and here, Wahlberg reigns as he personifies the cocky hotheaded Bobby Mercer. Andre Benjamin seemed somewhat muted too, after his recent screen stint as a flamboyant and trigger-happy gangster in Be Cool. Perhaps it is his role as the family man which adds that extra dimension and difference between him and the rest of the brothers - he can't be as carefree or act with total disregard as he has people who depend on him.This film also makes no apologies in adding that bit of realism to its dialogue, with street language and cursing aplenty, with plenty of stereotypical characters.But all in all, it's an enjoyable flick, as we observe in silent glee, the four brothers exacting revenge with R&B music humming along in the background.",Four Brothers
19,siderite,Fun 60-70's like movie. Revenge is sweet.,8,25 October 2005,"I was ready to bet that this was a remake after an older movie. Great 60's and 70's music, the endless theme of the small town terrorized by a villain and the rise to justice of the people involved, Mark Wahlberg... ;) OK, I am unfair to the man, but it's true isn't it? He is always cast into old looking movies or remakes. I actually like how he is playing. I think that he is a reasonable actor and has potential beyond the action movies in which we've become accustomed to seeing him.The plot is quite simple: adoptive mother of four and town saint gets killed by thugs. The four brothers kick ass accordingly. But beyond the obvious cliché, the movie was quite good. The actors played well, the feelings were nicely transmitted to the audience and the details were realistic enough and emotion conveying. Actually, for this kind of movie, I am ready to grade high.The bad thing about this film were the villains. Unconvincing small time crooks that suddenly have the power to hire people with Steyr Augur rifles and other high power weapons. Unconvincing crooked cop who has no motive for actually being corrupt. In the end, the movie is rather relaxing, considering we never meet anything unexpected.Worth a watch, although I would rate it as a TV movie, to watch in bed, rather than a cinema thing.",Four Brothers

What a great film that I've been needing after a few disappointments over the summer. I finally saw ""Four Brothers"" after everyone told me that it was a great movie. Trust me, it lives up to the hype.The drama is there, the action, and humor. Mark Wahlberg has come such a long way from the Calvin Kline Ad's. He's become a great actor along with a great cast, they all created an entertaining flick. If you loved Four Brothers, I would highly recommend The Boondock Saints.

21,KineticSeoul,Somewhat entertaining but oversimplified,6,22 February 2011,"When I first heard about this movie I had high expectations for this movie. Especially since I thought the premise of four brothers coming together to take care of a certain cause. Mainly because the mother of the four adopted sons mother got murdered. Which happens in the trailer and the beginning of the movie. I just really didn't really like the direction and character acting in this movie. I especially didn't like the direction of the dialogue, it seemed like it was trying too hard to sound to sound tough and cool. This may work in certain movies but it just doesn't really work in this one. Even the four brothers who use to be degenerates seemed like it was planned and not genuine, even the bond between the brothers seemed fake. In fact everything about this movie seemed forced. Even the different backgrounds between the four brothers didn't seem all that believable like it's there to just make the movie seem fresh. Which is fine, but it wasn't all that believable with the four degenerates. The most unbelievable part is how the some of the four brothers tries to act all hood they just didn't seem all that intimidating, yeah they found a new direction in life because of their mother. But the task they are trying to do, they just didn't seem all that intimidating. The characters are somewhat entertaining but not that believable. For a movie like this it would have been better if it was more dirty and gritty. Movies don't have to be realistic or believable to be entertaining, but for a movie like this it would have been better if it did go in that direction. The character decisions in some scenes were pretty stupid also. This movie really is one dimensional in a lot of ways, but some aspects of it was entertaining.6.4/10",Four Brothers
22,Buddy-51,"lackluster, implausible crime drama",4,5 November 2006,"""Four Brothers"" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund movie-making career. The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty ""Boyz n the Hood"" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again. The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother. When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters. By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area. The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, ""Four Brothers"" is by-the-book film-making from a director who has proved that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more.",Four Brothers

24,Robert_duder,Gritty and amazing!!,9,25 August 2005,"Sometimes the odd film makes even the most mediocre or in some cases poor actors/actresses do a good job. It's either incredible story telling, direction or a supporting cast or in this case all three. Mark Wahlberg from what I have seen of him has never been an impressive actor. The closest he came to being adequate was 1996's Fear. In Four Brothers he turns in an actual amazing performance as the lead character and ""brother"" Bobby Mercer. His character is gritty, mean, angry, emotional, and in my opinion a completely Oscar worthy performance which is really saying something considering I think the guy has been horrible up until now.Perhaps this can all be attributed to the brilliant story, written by David Elliot and newcomer Paul Lovett. Four Brothers is done in such a gritty street style with no real heroes but a host of cold, harsh anti heroes. The Mercer brothers are film characters of the highest order. They will be remembered in my book for a long time. Their violent nature and their form of brutal ""justice"" makes their style very controversial but still makes you want to root for them. Director John Singleton creates a dark setting of urban/gang warfare and also creates a thrilling and suspenseful mystery around the murder of the boy's adoptive mother. The four of them seem like such unlikely team mates and brothers but they are family in every sense of the word. Each actor who portrays a brother does it brilliantly in particular Wahlberg's character and Tyrese Gibson who plays Angel Mercer. Although all the characters follow Wahlberg's as their leader Angel stands out as having a mind and personality of his own.Four Brothers could have been downright violent but it wasn't over the top or malicious in content. Everything that existed in it was necessary but still a nicely violent film. Full of action, and a great storyline with some incredible acting. You really can't go wrong and I hope this film gets a lot of recognition beyond the box office and sticks around because it's one of the best I have seen in awhile. There are some genuinely great films to see in the theater right now and this is one of them. 9/10",Four Brothers
25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Left me four want of a better film,4,14 October 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits The titular four brothers return to their hometown to attend the funeral of their mother, who was gunned down in a liquor store hold-up. And, after a bit of alpha-male bonding (mainly involving the appropriately aggressive sport of ice hockey!) and re-acquainting, they set out to avenge her. But, as they go on their vengeful quest, twists and turns emerge that make their mission not as straight-forward as they suspected.""They came to bury their mother...and her killer"" the tagline blurts (one of the best revenge taglines ever, actually.) And that is moreorless the plot line. Four Brothers is yet another American revenge movie that have been popping relentlessly out the cookie-cutter machine since 9/11, showing the air of vengeance still rife some years after those tragic events.But it's flawed from the off-set. From the start, it's just preposterous to believe that some kindly, old-fashioned old white lady could turn so many lives around in a foul-mouthed, predominantly black area without having been robbed or blasted away long before she did at the beginning of the film. And secondly, the brothers one dimensional revenge feelings leave the film a little cold. Do they feel no guilt after having moved away and left her to cope for herself for so many years before her tragic end? No, they just wanna go pop a cap in da ass of the mother******* who did it straight-out. And for a cold tale of revenge like this, they're too jokey and light-hearted about it all, constantly blurting out wise-cracks and getting into silly situations, unbalancing the tone of the film unacceptably.As for the cast, as the leading brother, Mark Wahlberg is on fairly good form, doing some funny impressions in his light-hearted scenes, fairly moving in the film's more emotional ones, and Tyrese Gibson is in fare a notch above 2 Fast 2 Furious and there's pretty good support from Garrett Hedlund and Andre Benjamin (even if, altogether, they kept reminding me weirdly of the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, with the old lady as Splinter.) Early on, director John Singleton seems to be aiming for some kind of art house feel as Wahlberg drives to the funeral, but he ditches this pretty early on and we're left with the film we have.But above all, I just couldn't get over what an incredibly boring experience I found the film to be, with large segments just dragging by and failing to engage, not to mention the plot being a little too complicated for a film of it's kind. Some good points, but mostly just a very forgettable experience. **",Four Brothers
26,MLDinTN,not my kind of movie,3,18 January 2007,I didn't really care much for this film. I found it sort of boring with unnecessary violence. The story was slow and not thrilling for a supposed murder mystery. Four adoptive brothers solve the mystery behind there mother's death; it was more than a convenience store robbery. It was a planned murder. There's a lot of shooting and a totally unnecessary girlfriend for one of the brothers. She adds nothing to the film. And some how a dirty cop gets thrown into the mix.And Mark Wahlberg is not looking his best. They got his hair all oily looking and slicked back. Not a great look. But Tyrese is as hot as usual.FINAL VERDICT: I was bored and don't recommend it.,Four Brothers
27,g-bodyl,A Very Powerful Film!,10,26 May 2008,"Four Brothers is an excellent film, despite all the violence. The story revolves around four brothers. They all unite after not being around each other for many years when their mother was shot. After the incident, the brothers try to avenge their mother. The acting is undoubtedly terrific. Mark Wahlberg was the best as Bobby. He showed the true emotions of a character. Garrett Hedlund who played the youngest bro Jack was also great. The two middle brothers played by Andre 3000 of Outkast and Tyrese Gibson were good. All the action scenes were well-planned. The car chase is the best scene. Also the music is pretty good. There are some classic hits in the movie. I recommend this movie for teens 15 and up because of the violence. I rate this film a 10/10.",Four Brothers
28,UniqueParticle,Thoroughly enjoyable,9,5 September 2021,Love the cast so much and the way everything flows; John Singleton directed a glorious dark drama!

Would definitely recommend more to guys though.,Four Brothers
29,Floated2,Violet and Gritty,6,23 June 2017,"Four Brothers tells the story of four adopted sons of a murdered woman when return home to Detroit to bury. Their mother was the saint of the community, finding homes for abandoned and unwanted children. These four men were the only lost souls that no one wanted, so she took them in. They grew up to be criminals, but they ended up much better off than they ever would if she hadn't helped them. The film settles in once after comparing notes at the funeral, the brothers decide to look deeper into their mother's death. Without worries about the law and consequences, these four brothers make it their mission to bring justice to their town. This film is quite a rough and tough violet revenge film. At some parts does it dwindle but overall its a solid action thriller.",Four Brothers
30,johnnyboyz,"Tight and effective in a knock-about and fast moving sense, but do not assume it to be anything more.",6,11 January 2009,"There was a time when John Singleton used to grab a camera and go out and shoot on the streets thus capturing where and what he knew best; capturing his life as he saw it or recalled it and delivering engaging stories detailing hope and tragedy all the same. Those days were round about 1991 and the result of all that documentation was Boyz in the Hood, a memorable and engaging debut film. Following numerous other films that don't really hit the spot came Four Brothers, and it seems all Singleton can do now is make genre pictures detailing scruffy clichés and the glorification of violence solving the problem, and it's sort of difficult not to enjoy it in a guilty manner.But only in a guilty manner. We enjoy films like Four Brothers because they're fast moving and the underlying theme of respect and honour to the family or family members is what keeps it in that humbling sense, never branching out into some out-and-out glorification of violence being the answer to violence. Of course Singleton is miles away from his post-Second-World-War-Italy inspired neo-realistic roots of grabbing a camera and shooting where you are and what you are for sake of a film, but so what? He knows it and after five minutes, so do we. Instead, Four Brothers is a pretty standard and pretty enjoyable revenge vehicle that gets across its kicks in a knock about fashion, establishing who's 'good' and who's 'bad' and who we should be rooting for and why we should be.I actually quite like the idea behind the set up and that is that a lone individual in Bobby Mercer (Wahlberg) returns home after a stretch away and sees everything differently to what it was before. The reason he was away has to do with being in prison a few times, it usually does in these films, and I like the idea of an individual coming back and seeing things through a new perspective. It actually reminded me of Neil Jordan's 1986 film Mona Lisa as his lead, played by Bob Hoskins, returns to a now Thatcher ruled Britain and sees everything different and for the worse since he'd been inside. But Bobby is a guy that refuses to accept that time can just move on with obligatory changes being a part of it all. Despite pleads from the police to allow them to do their job, the film branches off into a tale of the vigilante with Bobby and his three other brothers named Jeremiah (Benjamin); Jack (Hedlund) and Angel (Gibson) hunting for some killers.The reason for the pooling together of all these elements is to do with the four boys' mother named Evelyn (Flanagan), who was shot as part of a store robbery. The immediate act of throwing the audience into the cauldron by having the murder of an elderly, defenceless lady is a deliberate move by Singleton. By plunging us headfirst into a film that has no prior pleasantries or introductions bar the fact Evelyn was a nice and somewhat upstanding and understanding woman (she lets a kid off shoplifting) before mercilessly popping her off, results in the audience building up such a degree of hate towards the evil-doers that we may well allow anything to fly when the time comes. This is prolonged during the scene in which each brother sits around the dinner table and sees their mother while communicating to her in their own way emphasising she is gone and this may have happened many times in the past but never again.In this sense, it's quite manipulative of Singleton to attempt to try and get us to side with the vigilantes to this gross level as they wreck a nasty revenge culminating in a scene most revenge films would save for their finale. The film is a revenge picture of sorts with that nicely grooved cause and effect ideation behind it as they try to find the robbers/murderers but it's only for so long. Remember that nobody seems to be avenging the store clerk and I guess the brothers couldn't care less about the fact a store was knocked off in the process with all the distress that brings. When the film realises its delivered its finale after thirty or so minutes, it branches off into territory to do with corruption and betrayal when it emerges a large sum of money was involved in the insurance to do with Evelyn's death  the film takes a detour down questioning one's loyalties.What escalates from here involves a local kingpin gangster named Victor Sweet (Ejiofor) who carries an overall message to do with something like 'if you ever find yourself achieving that level of power, do not abuse it' in the way he does by relying on favours and liabilities with your faithful subjects. A scene where he asks to 'borrow' his friend's wife soon before they're to be married sums this up best.I don't think Four Brothers is anything spectacular but its method of disguising vigilatism through dealing with it in the film's opening third before opening out into something else will not ensure the film is on most people's good side. It's as if they had to illegally hunt and kill someone in order to open up the bigger picture of corruption and this will not please everyone in its glorification. What it is, is tight mainstream entertainment that passes the time and on that level it works quite well in a dramatic and humbling sense.",Four Brothers
31,Chris Knipp,Male bonding,7,16 August 2005,"Anybody who goes to American movies knows if you enter a convenience store somebody's going to get shot. ""Four Brothers"" begins with a lovable old lady called Evelyn Mercer (Fionulla Flanagan) meeting that fate. Well, it turns out sweet little Evelyn was foster mom for four tough guys who were so mean as kids she was the only person willing to take them on. They may be less than model citizens now, but they'd probably not even be alive if it hadn't been for Evelyn Mercer. So when the Mercer boys -- Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and young Jack (Garrett Hedlund), who're white, and Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) who're black -- all come back together for the funeral and get hints that Evelyn was deliberately assassinated and not just caught in the crossfire, they go into action. When one of the brothers may have had involvement in the hit, the plot and the emotions get more complicated.Once again as in James Gray's richly atmospheric and brooding and admittedly far superior 2000 movie ""The Yards,"" Mark Wahlberg stars in a story about a doomed gangsterish family whose sins he tries to unearth and cleanse. The special charm of the male bonding is in the multi-racial brotherhood, which Singleton and the actors manage to inject a lot of warmth into. These guys are soulful, whether black or white. Not only is the sound track rich in Motown classics, but the brothers cry a lot.There are conscious allusions to ""Mystic River"" with its deep bonds, buried traumas, childhood street hockey games, and clapboard houses -- though this is Detroit, not Massachusetts. The sense of place, in fact, may waver; but the memories and loyalty don't. It's Thanksgiving, and the men stay at the old house, where the memories start the tears flowing. A turkey is baked and drinks are poured but the brothers aren't hungry. Bobby gets them to go out and play hockey.Next day a little investigation brings on the suspicions of a contract hit against their foster mom. Though Jeremiah objects, Bobby remains in charge. Jerry's relative respectability does not convey any influence in this family; his hesitancy about revenge already makes him seem disloyal. Right away at least three, and sometimes four, of the Mercer boys are in full attack mode and before you can say ""assault weapon,"" the screen is littered with the bodies of cheap gangsters, crooked cops, and gangster politicos. ""Hell, this is Detroit,"" somebody insists. Heads are smashed and weapons multiply, falling into the brothers' hands by the trunk load. Two detectives are watching all this -- one of them played by Terrence Howard, who's so great in ""Hustle and Flow"" -- and as in another better movie, Joe Carnahan's 2002 ""Narc,"" an element of corruption and betrayal comes in from that angle as well.Jeremiah claimed his reluctance to participate had moral and filial grounds: he said blood revenge was the last thing Evelyn would have wanted her death to bring about. But you wouldn't have been reading the movie very well if you thought he was the one we must listen to. Before long rumors link him with some insurance and a payoff that put his loyalty in doubt. But is he really a rotten apple, or just a bad businessmen? Suspicion falls inside and outside the family. Don't worry, if you're going to see ""Four Brothers,"" reading this review won't spoil it for you. I'm not going to tell you what the movie's secrets are. Hell, they were so twisted, I'm not sure I really understood them anyway. But this is an urban thriller, or if you like a ghetto western, and the procedural details aren't what it's about. It's about emotion, it's about action, it's about getting the bad guys. And the worst bad guy gets his comeuppance starkly and satisfyingly out on a sheet of ice. It's a nice detail that his gangster crew revolt because trade union experience makes them realize he's an abusive employer. Of course he's worse than that. He's a sadistic creep.The critics are right: this isn't a great movie. At moments it's not even a very good one. The chief villain's a little too villainous. The Nigerian-descent English actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (of Stephen Frears's 2002 ""Dirty Pretty Things""), who plays him, is out of his element (maybe he took the role for a change of pace). The plot's too tangled. The cops are too complicit, even for Detroit.Still, there's something that's underlyingly okay about ""Four Brothers."" Singleton is returning to the roots of his film-making, the ghetto and its destructive effects on young black men, which he memorably depicted in his 1991 ""Boyz N the Hood."" Mark Wahlberg's presence here feels right. Everybody's having a good time, which is something that should happen more often. There's nothing wrong with a dose of warm interracial male bonding, with tears and shootouts, every now and again. It can get you through a slow day. Unlike Cinderella Man's, this movies' snow looks pretty real. So do the women's ample cleavage. The movie's action is not convincing, but the atmosphere and people often are. There are a hell of a lot of weapons and gunshots in this movie, and a house gets turned into Swiss cheese like in the shootouts in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith."" ""Four Brothers"" is as lurid as the first and as fantastic as the second; but it still hurts when one of the brothers is lost, even if he goes with a sweet smile on his face.",Four Brothers
32,dee.reid,"Four times the mayhem in ""Four Brothers""",7,2 September 2005,"I have to admit ""Four Brothers"" is not a movie I was giddy about seeing. I didn't have really high expectations and why should I, much less you? Well, if you do have high expectations, you better lower them, because ""Four Brothers"" is not a deep and involving picture but is really more of a straight-forward action flick with a few sly one-liners thrown in for good measure.There's not a single wince of brain activity throughout it, though the four ""brothers"" of the title (Mark Wahlberg, Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, Garrett Hedlund), explained by one character as being ""total f**k-ups,"" do express a convincing degree of unity in that you actually believe they're related through their deceased, adopted mother Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan).Wahlberg is Bobby Mercer, the courageous tough-talking eldest brother and the one with a chip on his shoulder. Not surprisingly, he does the most talking and is the obvious leader. Benjamin is Jeremiah Mercer, the only one of the four to really make something of himself in that he has a legitimate business, a wife (Taraji P. Henson) and children, and the closest ties to their mother. Gibson is Angel Mercer, a (former) soldier of fortune who has the ladies (including feisty Latina Sofia Vergara), the bragging rights, and the connections. Lastly, Hedlund is Jack Mercer, the youngest and grungiest of the four who's also a wannabe rocker and had the most troublesome childhood of them all.The four are reunited at the funeral of their dear mom, who was viciously slain in a liquor store robbery. The brothers suspect that because of the particularly heinous nature of the crime, their mother may not have been some innocent bystander but was really executed, and the robbery itself was just there to throw off the cops.After much contemplation and not even bothering to heed the warnings of two flaky detectives (played by Terrence Howard and Josh Charles), the four go after their mom's killer. It shouldn't be any surprise that they find their mother had been inadvertently drawn into the middle of some big insurance scheme or something along those lines (it's not really all that well explained), so the brothers look to settle the score with anyone - everyone.As directed by John Singleton (whose outstanding landmark 1991 debut ""Boyz N the Hood"" remains the pinnacle of his career), ""Four Brothers"" is loud, dumb, and violent. The plot does a little more than resemble ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965), which I haven't seen, but I doubt it was as lacking in intelligence as ""Four Brothers.""However, the movie should be praised because it is strangely appealing (the totally PC leads notwithstanding), and the action is fast and furious, culminating in an impossible car chase through the ice-slicked Detroit streets during a snowstorm. And Singleton shows he hasn't completely lost my respect in that he's a good director during these scenes and succeeds in creating a believable atmosphere of unity amongst the four brothers.I expect this movie to be a success, since it's the last week of the summer and the August season of blockbusters has passed. But hey, it's the last week of the summer, ""Four Brothers"" is playing, and so don't everybody rush to the theaters. OK?7/10",Four Brothers
33,jimbo-53-186511,Death Wish In Da Hood,5,13 December 2016,"After their mother is killed at a convenience store by an 'organised' gang four brothers make it their mission to avenge their mother's death by taking out those responsible for her death.Four Brothers is another revenge film offering a slight variation of the Death Wish Formula. This results in a very uneven film that produces both good and bad results...The film begins promisingly with a fairly dramatic opening sequence but after this impressive opener the film seem to trundle along in fits and starts. I realise that some character development is necessary - in this instance I'm talking about our protagonists being introduced to the audience, but I felt that too much time was spent on this aspect of the story and it probably didn't help that I didn't feel that much of a dynamic existed between the 'brothers.'Hokey character dynamics aside I still found it hard to overlook the story in itself. As revenge films go there is nothing inherently wrong with it, but at the same time it isn't particularly exciting and does very little to get the blood racing or adrenaline flowing. There is a sub-plot involving one of the brother's getting into bed (metaphorically speaking) with the gang leader, but this aspect of the story is rather uninteresting.The film does have some good points; I thought that some of the set-pieces and action sequences were good and I thought that Chiwetel Ejiofor stole the show as the main villain. Rather than beat his men to a pulp for disobeying him he'll ask them to eat food from the floor or go and sit at a table with a bunch of kids. Nearly all of the scenes with him were great and the over the top way that he played his character meant that he was a lot of fun to watch. The supporting cast were all OK too although Sofia Vergara's '2 reasons' for being in the film become clear from a very early stage.Four Brothers isn't a terrible film, but it's hard not to look at it and feel a little bit disappointed.

36,noralee,REVISED Involving Look at Macho Camaraderie Amidst Violent Revenge,6,29 March 2008,"""Four Brothers"" takes an off-kilter premise and makes it credible, even though over-the-top violence challenges the extensive efforts to create realism.The film is anchored in the strong, macho camaraderie of the four excellent lead actors who convincingly portray two white and two African-American boys raised together as rough foster brothers adopted by a kind-hearted ex-hippie. The easy chemistry among the four is physical, both in interactions and how they move around their childhood home, and in their running graphic teasing. Their back story is smoothly relayed as police report summaries by Terrence Howard, convincingly using his third accent in a film this summer after ""Crash"" and ""Hustle & Flow."" (Also stay for the credits when sort of home movies are shown about the brothers' earlier experiences.) While Mark Wahlberg's swagger is a bit much, though worked in as an ex-hockey player context, each actor effectively embodies a unique character at a raw point in his life. Particularly outstanding as non-stereotypes are Garrett Hedlund, as an androgynous rocker haunted by past abuse, and André Benjamin, as a husband and father struggling with a business. Brit Chiwetel Ejiofor very effectively masters Americana as a head hood.While director John Singleton said on ""Charlie Rose"" that he sees the film as a Western in the tradition of John Ford and Howard Hawks, it's more like Sam Pekinpah crossed with detective ""a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"" twisty noir vengeance mysteries. The gritty one-on-one confrontations are much more effective than the exaggerated machine gunned destruction, even as Singleton brings unexpected poignancy to a key rampage through a sympathetic victim that is heartbreaking.Ironically the ex-marine brother is not the lead expert of the four with guns. While this seems like the third in a recent trilogy of using Detroit as a violent wasteland, after the remake of ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and ""Land of the Dead,"" Singleton accents the usual urban abandonment scenes by telescoping the action between wintry Thanksgiving to Christmas of constant snow, culminating in a white frozen climax that is more cleverly mano a mano and less violent than the preliminary confrontations. It would recall Springsteen's ""Meeting Across The River"" except that the soundtrack song selections instead superbly are later Motown, visualized nostalgically with '45's playing with the notable local skyline on that dark blue label. The rocker brother is a nice tribute to the city's white kick out the jams heritage as well. Unfortunately, the instrumental score is clunky and unsubtle.The women are strictly ancillary for stereotypical uses, though respected by the men. Sofía Vergara as the ""La Vida Loca"" old irresistible girlfriend feistily adds to the multicultural mix.Both for the violence and the blunt language, I thought it was really inappropriate that parents brought young children to the matinée I attended.(Revised 29 March 2008 - evidently the version I submitted on 22 August 2005 offended someone)",Four Brothers
37,davispittman,If you like a lot of gangster and locker room banter.....,5,24 April 2017,"Four Brothers is all about thugs to be perfectly honest. If you like gangster movies then I guess you'll like this okay, personally I was really annoyed with it a lot of times. I like movies where I can really pull for the protagonist and where I don't feel badly towards them, and I really couldn't do that in this movie, I mean yes there were many times where I felt horrible for them and I wanted them to win, but at the same time they were jerks a lot of the time and all the locker room tough guy junk got on my nerves and it got really old after a while. The casting was good for the kind of rolls these men played, especially Mark Wahlberg since he really was a thug in real life and plays characters with that kind of attitude many times. The acting isn't really bad it's certainly not great by any means, but i wouldn't say it's poor, my thing was just that the male characters annoyed me with their crap a lot throughout the film. There are a few touching moments about them trying to find their mothers killer and there are some memories of their mother that are nice to see, but those times come pretty far and few in between. I got bored with the film sometimes and wanted it to move along. Overall I don't really suggest this film, there are better ones that are more worthy of your time. 5/10.",Four Brothers
38,fertilecelluloid,"Awful, contrived crap",1,21 January 2006,"John Singleton, the director of the excellent ""Boys in the Hood"", has fallen far. ""Four Brothers"" is rubbish.Even worse, it is forced, contrived rubbish. Dumb-ass premise sees four adopted brothers return to the town of their upbringing to attend the funeral of their murdered foster mother. While hanging out and opening old wounds, they decide to take the law into their own hands and find the murderers. Not exactly original, but it is the treatment of the material that sucks the biggest.The opening prologue, where Singleton introduces the boys' mother and busts his gut to show what a good Samaritan she is, is pure, sickly, badly written melodrama. The scenes following the funeral, in which we are given flashback snippets of the boys' interactions with their mother while they are tucking into a giant Thanksgiving turkey, are nauseating. It is clear so early on that Singleton's structure is unworkable and his approach is horribly miscalculated.Another major irritant is the godawful music and unoriginal use of sound. The result is a flat, unconvincing, superficial piece of Hollywood junk. It is sad to see the talented Singleton succumbing to such puerile, artificial nonsense.There are a few violent sequences, but none of these cancel out the damage done by the film's total lack of realism and heinous resorting to the most whipped-to-death cinematic clichés.Awful.",Four Brothers

She was shot in what seemed a random robbery-gone-wrong in a convenient store. There were four brothers even though they did not resemble each other a bit. All four were adopted by a murdered woman many years ago when she was a social worker and tried to find new homes for the children from dysfunctional families. Nobody wanted those four. She did. She took them in, brought them up, gave them love and support and they called her mom and themselves - brothers. Now she is dead, and the brothers start their own investigation on the dirty and often deadly streets of their childhood city to find those who were behind the murder. Very soon they discover that the robbery was a cover up for a hit murder. Someone wanted their mother dead and paid for her murder. Four brothers Mercer, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), the leader, the oldest, toughest, short- tempered, and stubborn; Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), the only family man of four who had taken care of the mother the last years; Angel (Tyres Gibson), the sexy one, and Jack (Garrett Hedlund), the youngest, whom three older brothers try to protect, are determined to avenge their mother's death no matter what it would cost. The film was directed by John Singleton as an urban thriller -revenge movie which is also a family drama, and I like it very much. It is violent, gritty, it moves well, it's got many plot turns on its way, it is packed with very effective dynamic action scenes, and acting is very good by all principal players. I was especially impressed by Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn as Victor Sweet, the pure evil despite his name. Ejifor said once, ""I like to disappear into a role. I equate the success of it with a feeling of being chemically changed"". The actor whom I first noticed in a compelling role of an illegal immigrant in London in the film Dirty Pretty Things (2002), was frightening in Four Brothers. I am also becoming a fan of Mark Wahlberg. He's got charisma and screen presence. The film does not fail to provide some humor, to show how much the four brothers mean to one another, and what the woman whom they lost meant to them. I missed the movie when it was released and actually did not know anything about it until this evening when its opening scene grabbed my attention; I began watching and did not leave until the credits started rolling.A bit of trivia: John Singleton is the youngest Oscar nominated director. He received the honors at the age of 24 after completing and releasing his directorial debut, the phenomenal Boyz n the Hood (1991) which was based on his own childhood in a LA ghetto. Where do you move if you start your career on such high note? Four Brothers may not be as great as Boyz n the Hood but it is a darn good and entertaining film.",Four Brothers
41,lemon_magic,"Plagued by Singleton's usual storytelling problems, not as good as I hoped, but better than I expected",7,17 September 2005,"John Singleton drives me crazy. He has a gift for creating interesting and ""cool"" protagonists, compelling plot ideas, and immersive atmospheres in his films. But he just doesn't seem to be able to tell a story that doesn't trip on its own shoelaces at some point as it dashes for the finish line. If he ever gets it right, he may well come up with a movie for the ages, instead of the interesting but flawed spectacles that he is known for (his most famous film, ""Boyz.."" is powerful but not ""great"".) This is still the case for ""4 Brothers"". It has some very powerful moments, and scenes that may stick in your memory for many years to come. However, the viewer should go to see for those moments and enjoy them as they happen, and not think too much about the overall worth of the story being told. The screenplay starts out with an interesting, gritty idea for an urban drama, featuring four anti-hero protagonists with a strong ensemble chemistry. But about 1/3 of the way in, the screenplay rides off into Cloud Cuckoo Land and starts throwing so many extra elements into the mix that the results just don't hang together. And at some point, the ""Oh suuuuure"" factor simply becomes too much. Some examples: At one point, brother ""Bobby"" disrupts a basketball game at a community center by pulling a pistol out at center court and threatening the teams and the crowd with it. The ostensible reason for this is to flush out a runner or a witness who they can track to their quarry. And it works. But there are NO consequences for pulling this stunt, which should have been a 3rd degree felony at the very least, and should have brought the police down on the brothers like a hammer on rye toast. Another example: One of the brothers (""Angel"") resumes a relationship with an old flame as soon as he comes back to town, and the girl ends up virtually living in his bedroom over the course of the next few days. (As Shaft said in Singleton's previous film,""You've got to pay your duty to that booty."""") This is all well and good, and is meant to flesh out the character as a complete person and not just a vengeance driven stereotype...but literally every scene involving this girlfriend drags on with cheesy sitcom humor that stops the movie dead. And again, the ""Oh Suuuure"" factor pops up: Angel and his brothers are on their way out the door to pursue an urgent hot lead to their mother's murder, and the girlfriend wastes 40 seconds of screen time complaining about the meal she spent two hours cooking while Angel tries to placate her. It's supposed to be funny, but it isn't. You can't believe for a second that Angel wouldn't quash that noise with a curt reply about what his REAL priorities were, or that the girlfriend would be so shallow that she wouldn't realize what was at stake.Another problem: the film can't decide whether to pay attention to the police efforts or not. In the beginning, it appears that the police aren't going to be effective in their efforts, and the two actors playing the investigative team just seem to be doing walk-on roles. Then the black member of the team gets some screen time as things heat up, and it appears as if he may play an important role, his partner shoots him, and he dies. There just wasn't enough screen time spent establishing the cops as sympathetic characters or otherwise before the shocking murder takes place. Just as we start to know and like the character, he gets shot dead. Problem numero four: more than halfway into the movie, the investigation proceeds leads to figure behind the murder, a gangster on the rise called Victor Sweet, and then the movie proceeds to spend a LOOOONG scene that shows Sweet is a sinister, sadistic creep who rules by humiliating and dominating his men. And ""Oh Suuuuure"" factor pops up again when Sweet goes out of his way to humiliate a loyal lieutenant by promising to cuckold him with his new wife. It's a nasty, glib scenario and is guaranteed to rankle the sensibilities of anyone watching. (I don't blame the actor for this, though - I think he was giving the performance the director wanted.) And these are just the flaws I thought of in 30 seconds. The whole 2nd half of the film is like this, with false notes and miscues jarring the viewers' suspension of disbelief and irritating his desire for an integrated, seamless story. If not for the performances, cinematography and soundtrack, you'd be really irritated at the careless scripting going on here. It sounds as if I hate this movie. But really, I don't. All the actors are good-to-great, even Mark Wahlberg, whose continued career success is mostly inexplicable to me. As I've said previously, there are lots of powerful moments, well staged gunfights and visceral fistfights, and clever dialog and witty byplay. I pick on the film's problems because there is so much here to like, and yet the viewer has to keep turning his or her brain off to keep the story from annoying him to distraction. It's a good film that could have been a GREAT film if only Singleton would learn to keep his films a little simpler and a little more consistent.Singleton apparently has three films in the pipe after ""4 Brothers""...it's entirely possible that wiser collaborators may get him to calm down a bit and help his storytelling gifts gel better. I certainly hope so. But in the meantime, I'll continue to go see Singleton's movies for the definite pleasures they provide.",Four Brothers
42,pc95,"Not bad - clichéd, but it grew better as it went on",7,7 January 2006,"For about the first 20 minutes of this movie I was trying to decide whether it was believable or likable. Yes it feels pretty run-of-the-mill, but I enjoyed the central theme of the 4 brothers after the movie progressed and was over. Mark Walberg is pretty much himself as an actor like lot of actors....his movies are often hits or misses. This one's not quite either, maybe a little closer to a hit - it has some good action scenes - especially the snowy car chase. I began to like the characters more as the dialogue progressed and despite some implausibilities - like the good old clichéd bank pulling out $400k in cash I was willing to overlook them to enjoy the brothers and their predicament. The side-story dirty cop didn't detract either and was nicely woven into the main one. The movie score is pretty weak though at times - you'd think it was straight off a TV episode.....not bad - worth the rental.",Four Brothers
43,winner55,Four more Sons of Katie Elder,6,23 September 2005,"This film raises anew issues that have haunted action films since the mid-1960s, when there was a weird crossing between east and west, and several occidental directors plagiarized Japanese samurai films to make cowboy movies, and several oriental directors began plagiarizing cowboy movies to make martial arts films. The main issue is whether the plotting of one type of genre action film can be successfully translated into the conventions of another category of action film. It's not a question with a decisive answer; it reappears with every film attempting such a translation.In this case, a classic cowboy film, the Sons of Katie Elder, is ""updated"" into a contemporary street-gang crime film setting. ""SoKE"" was not really a great film, just a well-made and entertaining B-movie; any updating would therefore result either in massive restructuring of the plot to produce an original film, or a fairly well-controlled experiment in imitation.I took Four Bros. to be the latter, an imitation. As such, I found it very entertaining. Since as an imitation it exists entirely within the dreamland of Hollywood history, I didn't try to relate it to contemporary reality. As a cowboy movie transplanted to contemporary Detroit, it was well-made and entertaining. (I was especially pleased that there were so little computer-effects; I am sick to death of computerized animation and effects, they are all so phony, only those who have been raised on computers can still be impressed with them.) However, on review of the criticisms written on this film, I must admit that many of them appear justified; the holes in the plotting, the social incongruities, the implausible situations and their unbelievable coincidental resolutions - all true.So, my take on the film is simply this. As entertaining B-movie, accept it as a fantasy and enjoy; but when seeking a comment on real life, look elsewhere.",Four Brothers

47,oneguyrambling,A bad joke set-up turns into a reasonable film...,5,25 April 2011,"OK so four brothers walk into a bar, two white guys and two black guys.Far from the start of a bad joke setup this is actually a key element of this film.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: The four guys were all children from troubled or unfortunate situations taken in by the same caring lady who raised them as solid citizens – or at least better than how they may have turned out – a couple of the lads are still quite rough around the edges. The four have grown and gone their separate ways and blazed their own personal trails, they are brought back together after the untimely death of ""Ma"" in an apparently random shooting in a Detroit convenience store robbery.With Ma's funeral looming the four boys all arrive home to pay their last respects: Bobby (Marky Mark Wahlberg) – A straight talking, fast acting loose cannon.Jack – A somewhat introverted musician. Cops some flak as the other boys (Bobby at least) openly ponder if he's gay.Jeremiah (Andre ""3000"" Benjamin) – The most successful of the quartet. A businessman developing his own premises with a stable home, wife and family. He is affable, honest and ambitious.Angel (Tyrese Gibson) – A simple man with big muscles and simple needs.The early going has the boys reminiscing about their childhood and their time with Ma, in one particular scene they all have extremely vivid visions or recollections or what life was like with her around. In fact the entire first 40 minutes play out slowly with a fair element of emotion and character development, the boys joke, bicker, (play)fight and discuss what was and what might have been.Then Bobby announces to one and all that they owe it to Ma to find out exactly why she died and who is responsible, then this carefully constructed ""family drama"" all of the sudden turns into a straightforward shoot 'em up kill the bad guys affair.The early investigations are relatively low key – at least compared to what follows – but they do raise enough dust to bring the attention of the local cops who, are already familiar with the boys due to previous dealings. The cops (Terrance Howard and some other guy) warn them against starting their own personal revenge war.It seems the lads just don't listen. The second half of the film has running gun battles including one that essentially destroys their childhood home. There are shootouts, car chases and multiple killings – essentially enough bad stuff for them all to be arrested 447 times.Ultimately they follow the trail to the real killer, which leads to another massive scale gun battle and other events that overstep the realms of plausibility by about 15 steps.Four Brothers starts with a reasonably serious tone, but finishes with a cartoony second half and some jaw dropping plot holes or at requires leaps of logic that are hard to take. The four boys do well to keep a straight face through most of it and the performances are all OK, Sofia Vergara is suitably over the top – both in performance and tank top – in her role as Angel's screeching hot tempered girlfriend, and the ""Bad Guy"" is suitably menacing, if perhaps the most cartoony of all.Final Rating – 5.5 / 10. I'm not sure if I am that disappointed with the fact this film takes a turn towards the ludicrous, the second half is definitely more entertaining even if it seems to be at odds with the patient build up of the first half.",Four Brothers

The action sequences that follow are well-staged, violent and exciting to watch and the force that drives these men on so powerfully is the intense loyalty and respect that they feel for the only woman who was prepared to take them in and give them a home at a time in their lives when nobody else would.Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) was the kind-hearted woman who had fostered countless children in Detroit, Michigan before passing them on to their respective adoptive parents. However, four of the boys that she fostered were such troublemakers that they became impossible to place and so she adopted them herself. After her death, the four men who share the same sense of loyalty to their ""mother"" and each other, reunite and quickly discover that she had, in fact, been murdered and that the local police are inept and certainly not determined enough to bring the culprits to justice. In these circumstances, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) take matters into their own hands.As the oldest brother, ex-con Bobby, who's tough and volatile, takes the lead in everything they do. Angel is a womanizing ex-serviceman, Jeremiah has become a businessman with a family of his own and Jack, who was very badly treated before being fostered, has dreams of becoming a rock singer. The brothers soon catch up with the two guys who held up the convenience store and simply execute them when they prove to be unhelpful in identifying who ordered the hit on their mother. Their further investigations reveal that Evelyn had been betrayed by a corrupt cop when he'd informed local crime boss Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor) that she'd sought the help of the police to put matters right after Jeremiah had been criminally ripped off by Sweet during a lucrative property deal. This information then gives the brothers' mission added impetus and leads inexorably to a confrontation between Bobby and Victor Sweet during which their differences are finally resolved.""Four Brothers"" is an unpretentious revenge thriller that champions vigilantism and appeals to its audience purely on a visceral level. Its combination of sentimentality and moments of extreme violence inevitably make its pacing problematic but overall, it entertains because of the quality of its action scenes, the brothers' camaraderie (which is so well portrayed) and its great soundtrack which contributes strongly to a distinct 1970s' vibe. The quality of the acting is also generally good with the portrayals of the four brothers and good cop Lieutenant Green (Terrence Howard) making the strongest impressions.",Four Brothers

51,krorie,This movie will get your attention and hold it,7,13 August 2005,"One good thing Steven Spielberg has done for 21th century movies is to show the importance of starting things off with a bang rather than a whimper, something he learned from the old grade B films of the 30's, 40's, and 50's. So when director John Singleton begins ""Four Brothers"" he doesn't dwell on background material about how mom came to be the shining star for her boys. Singleton goes right for the jugular by showing mom's demise--I say showing, the viewer doesn't actually see the killing in the beginning. Singleton builds up the relationship between mom and the brothers step by step, letting a Detroit policeman, Lt. Green (Terrence Howard), introduce the four brothers as they show up for the funeral and become reacquainted. Not to give away the story, one heavy leads to another until the whole city of Detroit becomes a personification of corruption and evil. I loved the Motown music played throughout the film which was very apropos for the setting.Even though the acting was first-rate throughout, I especially liked the performances given by Josh Charles as Detective Fowler and by Garrett Hedlund as Jack Mercer. I know Josh Charles has appeared in movies I have seen but I don't remember his acting standing out as it does in this film. Also Chiwetel Ejiofor was just right as the slimy egomaniac Victor Sweet--and what a name for a character this egregious.The action is first rate and there is plenty of it from start to finish. Hold on to your seats for the scary gun battle between mom's boys hold up in her old house and Sweet's hired thugs.

Essentially, this film should have been about a family of four brothers who are out to investigate how their mother was killed, but for marketing reasons they lumped two white actors with two black actors together with the notion that they were all adopted etc etc in a ham fisted fashion to create a full storyline. Mark Wahlberg though out of the lot does a poor embarrassing impression of being from the streets in NY. Humour is poor and badly executed, whilst the characters are hardly developed.Storyline borders on the insane, and is as ridiculous as you can get. It will though still find its audience, and even if you wish to watch it, I'd recommend you just to wait and save your pennies as it will find itself being a general TV gap filler on a Tuesday late night spot in a couple of years time.

55,DonFishies,"Tries too hard to be clever, and loses the audience as a result",7,6 April 2006,"While we clearly don't need another remake, I would be lying if I said this movie didn't make one hell of a try to be good.Based very similarly on the John Wayne Western The Sons of Katie Elder, the film plays off as a modern urban western. The characters don't wear cowboy hats, but as they walk into different establishments looking for trouble, you can't help but imagine them walking into places from the Old West. Hell, some of the sequences involving guns look like highly stylized shots from Westerns, just with an undeniably 2006 Urban-street outlook. There's even the inevitable final showdown that we've seen done all too many times.The cast is off and on throughout the picture. Mark Wahlberg tries his best, but for a tough hard-ass, I think he cries a touch too much. Humanizing this monster could have been done in a number of other ways. Whereas Tyrese Gibson looks fairly comfy in his role, Andre Benjamin is totally miscast. Garrett Hedlund is given not nearly enough material to contend with the other three, so it's hard to say whether or not he pulled his role off well enough. Terrence Howard is there, and as always, tries to outshine, but isn't given the time to exercise his acting muscle, or show off the feelings he did in Crash or Hustle & Flow. The man was nominated for an Oscar after all. The rest of the cast is throwaway, and are either used barely, or not nearly enough. The film is about the brothers, but if you want to introduce characters 45-60 minutes into a 120 minute film, at least flesh them out enough for us to care about their introduction.The storyline flows wonderfully through the first hour. It hooks you, and keeps you hooked until you attempt to continue getting into the film. Then, it loses all of its appeal, and just slowly declines. Where in one scene, the brothers are heartbroken and shaken up, another just like it is thrown away as if it is nothing. The film makes us try our best, despite some rather violent sequences, to think of these guys as men who care about the wellbeing of their family. But scenes like these (and there are a few), just make us toy with our viewpoint, and see them as egotistical monsters out for just themselves and not giving a damn about anyone else. These scenes completely jerk the audience around, and it is totally unclear what John Singleton wants us to feel for these guys by the end.And as the film continues to its eventual finale, it just tries way too hard to be clever and totally falls apart as a result. It just toys with the audience a little too much, and you lose any interest you had in the film up to those minutes where it takes a sharp turn that it never recovers from. It feels like a total waste in the end. It's unfair, but if you're going to watch a film like this, you can't expect any less.A good polish of the script, and maybe a few characters being forced out of the screenplay could have only improved this film to stand independent away from Katie Elder. Instead, yet another urban feeling movie, swings and falters to its inevitable conclusion, and loses its audience as a result.

The four brothers Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Jack (Garrett Hedlund), Angel (Tyese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) want revenge. They don't think the police will find the murderers, so they start looking into the crime themselves.(Comment) The film shows that the children of a murder victim suffer greatly after losing a loved one, and their first thought and reaction is for revenge against the criminal. You feel the chemistry and connection that these four actors have in playing their parts. Even though the four men were adopted and are of different races, you will see their love and interaction as brothers. This is an adult family movie with a lot of humor, action and realistic brutality. The storyline has it all, a crime boss, hired killers, good and bad cops, corrupt politicians, and victims.

Nothing but revenge will do and the streets will be covered in blood.'Four Brothers' is a good urban revenge flick that will surely please its intended crowd. Lots of gun-play and some humor pepper the film and sprinkle a tad of blaxploitation for good measure, a winning combo for sure. The acting is good with Mark Wahlberg heading up the brothers. The writing is solid with enough action to move quickly enough and even a few welcome twists here and there. John Singleton's direction is solid and is a return to form after some mixed outings ('Shaft') and tepid sequels ('2 Fast 2 Furious'). I still believe Singleton is one of the best black filmmakers in town and hope to see much more from him. The design is what it is, a down and dirty urban sprawl with all the nasty bits to go with. The music is surprisingly low key. Most urban flicks cover their inadequacies with loud, bassy rap songs by whoever's big at the time, which this has but it's not overwhelming and allows the score pop in and do it's thing.'Four Brothers' is a nice change.

61,MichaelMargetis,"""That wasn't no gang shooting. That was an execution. They set Mom up. They set her up. "" - Bobby",5,7 January 2006,"It's incredibly evident that the premise of 'Four Brothers' is anything but original and borderline silly. You can tell this just by watching the movie preview. John Singleton's (Boyz in the Hood, the remake of Shaft) new movie circles around a rather meaty subject in action films these days -- revenge. The story follows four foster children who grew up together; Bobby (Mark Wahlberg - Boogie Nights), Angel (Tyrese Gibson - 2 Fast 2 Furious), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin - Be Cool) and Jakc (Garrett Hedlund - Friday Night Lights). Although they have different skin tones (two are white, two are black) they still consider each other brothers because brotherhood goes deeper than 'the color of your skin'. After their step-mother gets gunned down at a local convenience store, they decide to take revenge -- BLOODY REVENGE. But how will it turn out? Four Brothers is very predictable, but quite entertaining for the most part. Some parts in it are so overly ridiculous you can't help but roll your eyes while other action sequences following the brothers' brand of street justice will have you cheering 'Get em'!"" (not out loud, to yourself). A major flaw of the film is that although most of the time it doesn't try to be something it's not (groundbreaking, innovative, spectacular), it gets too melodramatic for it's own good, and that annoyed the hell out of me. There's enough action and bloodshed to entertain, but it unfortunately doesn't come along until twenty-five minutes into the film. 'Four Brothers' is a fun film with some major flaws. Barely Recommended. Grade: C+",Four Brothers
62,danielmanson,More like a 6.5,6,23 May 2020,"It's not too bad of a watch at all. I'm glad I picked the film this evening, but I had a few issues with it which I wanted to discuss.The plot definitely did well in terms of having little twists and turns, but it didnt over explain why they actually killed the mother at the very beginning well enough for me. It was kind of briefly overviewed.
The bad guys weren't involved as much as I'd like them to be, they were good characters so would have liked to have seen them develop more.The action scenes were decent though (could have done with a bit more), the acting was fantastic and I really liked how it's a different style of your typical action movies.It's a good watch, not one I'll rave about to my mates but it's worth watching if you like action movies",Four Brothers
63,Ali_John_Catterall,The Sons of Mother Mercer,5,3 December 2009,"When Angelic Mother Mercer is shot dead during a liquor store hold-up, her four adopted sons go hunting for the perps and uncover small town corruption in this contemporary western, inspired by The Sons of Katie Elder. It's all a bit daft and looks very cheap, even by Singleton's lo-fi standards. But this being Singleton (that rare breed of indie director who refuses to be bought) there's some good social commentary to be found among the flying bullets and boo-hiss villains - most obviously, the fact that that modern families may not be exclusively comprised of one race anymore. Great soundtrack too, including Marvin Gaye and The Temptations, and cheerfully gung-ho performances from the attractive leads - even if Marky Mark these days resembles a pork scratching that's been left out in the rain.",Four Brothers
64,ethanbresnett,Mark Wahlberg doing what he does best,7,22 August 2020,"Four Brothers is another solid entry in Mark Wahlberg's filmography. Although there was nothing individually amazing about Four Brothers, the film was definitely greater than the sum of its parts.What surprised me most about it was the chemistry between the eponymous brothers. They worked surprisingly well together on screen and actually portrayed a believable relationship. There were some good comedic moments alongside some hard hitting emotional ones, which were delivered well by the four main cast members. It was these four characters really that gave the film a surprising amount of charm, perhaps odd given the subject matter of the film and the context.I enjoyed the plot too, which had a good level of intrigue and was well mapped out. There were a few good red herrings and some intricate plot threads which culminating in a rewarding ending. Don't get me wrong its nothing ground breaking, but very entertaining.Mix all of this in with some (often over the top) well executed action and a good supporting cast (notably Sofia Vergara) and you've got yourself a winner.If you like Mark Wahlberg films where he plays a hard yet principled criminal/anti-hero (of which there are many) then look no further as this is a fine addition to that genre.",Four Brothers

66,hokeybutt,Good Crime Drama/Family Drama Hybrid,6,27 August 2005,"FOUR BROTHERS (3 outta 5 stars) Well-done crime drama/family drama hybrid benefits a lot from some of the fine actors involved. Even when the movie falls apart towards the end (with one ridiculous plot complication or hard-to-believe moment after another), it has built up so much goodwill that you can't be too upset. True, it does keep the movie from being a classic, but it's fun and exciting in ways that too few modern action-thrillers are. I don't generally care much for Mark Wahlberg's acting but... he doesn't hurt the movie... too much. He gets the showiest role in the movie's big ""showdown"" but he is definitely the least interesting of the ""four brothers"". Andre Benjamin (of OutKast/""Hey Ya"" fame) does a great job in his first big role... but it's Garrett Hedlund, another new film face, who steals the movie as the youngest brother. As previously mentioned, credibility takes a beating at times... but the focus on the relationship between the adopted brothers helps to keep the movie from going right off the deep end.",Four Brothers

There are also a lot of parts which make you stop and think about it for a second. Mark Wahlberg serves well as the loud mouthed Bobby Mercer. A lot of people will sling crap about this movie for being corny or something. My question to them is ""Where is it corny?"" Seriously, I can't find it. Some parts seem a little overdone, but come on, you can't hate a unique movie like this for a reason like that. There were some twists in the movie, none that ruined the story really. Some good fighting and shooting here as well. You really get to know the characters after a while. It takes a little to get into, but once you do you will love this movie. 8/10",Four Brothers
69,p-jonsson,Rather boring amateur rampage,4,2 January 2015,"This movie sounded rather good when I read about it. I do like a good revenge movie. Unfortunately it did not exactly live up to expectations. This is more an amateur rampage than a planned attempt to find out who the culprit is and exact revenge. A good chunk of the movie is spent with the four brothers mouthing off at each other. Another good chunk is spent with them very amateurishly running around waving guns and ""interrogating"" people. Somehow, mostly by sheer luck, they actually manage to get closer to their goal. Even the good cop in the movie behaves as a bloody amateur when confronted with what he knows is a crooked cop and of course gets the short end of the stick for his efforts.As if the amateurish behavior of the four brothers was not annoying enough they have thrown in a hysterical, supposedly Italian, girlfriend who is dumber than a doornail and excruciatingly frustrating when she shows up shouting, screaming and generally tries to sabotage the brothers attempts to get anywhere.The only thing mildly intelligent and entertaining about this movie was the ending when the brothers confronted the crooked cop and the main bad guy. I have to say that I did not see that coming. Otherwise the movie was pretty null to me. Technically it had no problem. It was decent enough shot and the actors did a quite good job of the roles they were given. It fell down big time on the script however. At least for me.",Four Brothers
70,cat_ranchero,Better than expected...,7,31 March 2013,"The plot is very slow after the initial murder of Evelyn Mercer and this may have put many off. It does, however pick up towards the middle third and by the end it has reached full throttle. The gritty realism of the story is enhanced by the winter scenes on the streets of Detroit. I can't say I was overly enthused by the choice of music throughout, but then it's not really my scene man. The performances were all excellent with Mark Wahlberg and Tyrese Gibson taking most of the spotlight, but I thought nobody put a foot wrong throughout. Over all a gritty realistic and sometimes brutal revenge thriller. Maybe a little too slow for some in the beginning but the pace does pick up (I promise).SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Four Brothers

The script was on the level of a third grader; toilet humor, cartoon action scenes, gross and over the top stereo-typing of everyone involved. There was absolutely nothing to link the main four actors. They say if you have nothing nice to say about someone or something you should say nothing, and that was exactly what I was going to do. However, I just couldn't believe that over 2,000 members here thought this movie was a 10. I'd rather see the original 1960s John Wayne film, The Sons of Katie Elder, in which this is a flimsy remake.

74,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Fun entertainment that's action packed, fearless, and hilarious",9,8 May 2007,"Four Brothers is one of the more underrated films to come out in 2005, because the year was dominated by other great action/crime/thriller films, such as Star Wars, Batman Begins, and Red Eye. However, Four Brothers stands out as a great buddy movie that any group of friends (or brothers) should enjoy together. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Four Brothers is a great film that is pure entertainment at it's finest.When their mother (Fionnula Flanagan) is brutally murdered, her four adoptive sons Bobby (Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jerry (Andre Benjamin), and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) set out to find her killer. And they don't need the help of the police.The acting is certainly spectacular, despite 3 of the stars having started out their careers in music (Wahlberg, Gibson, Benjamin). Wahlberg is a great lead as a character who is a really bad guy...but he's a good man as well. Bobby Mercer is easily one of the most likable characters of recent memory because of his sarcastic attitude and admirable dedication. Tyrese and Andre Benjamin both add emotionally powerful performances, and with Tyrese especially, it's to be expected. Both really show their acting strengths. Garrett Hedlund is the youngest of the brothers, but holds his own. The banter between Hedlund and Wahlberg is priceless and hysterical. Even though they're adopted, you can definitely feel the brotherly chemistry between these two in particular. The four actors all have excellent chemistry with one another, and most of the comedy comes from the brotherly nagging and complaining that every family has. It really gives a relaxed feel to the film, but at the same time not letting us forget how serious the plot of the film is. Chiwetel Ejiofor is good as the villain of the film, but it's an overdone character, which takes the film from a 10 to a 9. Terrence Howard and Josh Charles are also very good in roles as detectives, especially Charles towards the end.Director John Singleton creates a gritty and realistic world for the film, using Detroit as the setting, which (sorry Detroit), is a great idea for a movie like this. All of the events are quick. The film is very fast paced and goes by quickly. There aren't a lot of twists, which I also would have liked, but sometimes straight thrillers with minimal twists, like The Departed, turn out pretty well. The script is average and straightforward, but it's nothing to worry about. The action is as extraordinary as the acting, especially an icy car chase during the dead of night and an extremely well done shootout towards the end. My favorite part was the last 15 minutes, which contains one of the most badass moments in film history. You'll see.9/10 --spy",Four Brothers

77,JoshtheGiant,A Sometimes Funny Mess,3,23 December 2005,"Four Brothers has a good title but unfortunately that is about all it has going for it. It lacks a logical story that seems like it would work much better in a video game. The plot is simply horrible, it has too do with Four adopted brothers who come home for the funeral after their mother is killed in a department store shooting. They than decide to shoot up the hole town to find the person or persons who killed her. The first half is a pretty good start but after that the story goes into clichés and lack of anything like a good plot. The script is also awful with bad dialogue and the characters are also just horrible. The performances are horrible and that is quite a surprise when you think about some of the cast. The directed is just horrible, he has no idea where the story is going, the film also has more noticeable flaws than Ihave ever seen in another movie, and I mean stuff like continuity.

79,TheMovieMark,How refreshing - a movie that actually exceeded my expectations!,8,12 August 2005,"If you had ever told me that I would end up really liking a movie starring Marky Mark from the Funky Bunch and the lead singer of Outkast (the perpetrators of one of the most annoying songs in recent history - Hey Ya) then I would've laughed right in your face. Come on, a movie with three rappers (Tyrese throws down the rhymes also, yo!)? There's no way I would've expected that to satisfy my entertainment needs. But I'm man enough to admit that I would've been wrong.Four Brothers is a gritty, testosterone-fueled crowd pleaser that mixes drama, action, and humor. If you're looking for something light and fluffy then keep on looking because you won't find it here. But if you're in the mood to see some bad guys get pumped full of bullets and fists then this will put a smile on your face. The audience at the screening I attended was clapping and cheering throughout the movie. You'd have thought we were at a wrestling match.This plays out a bit like a Western. A wrong is done, a posse seeks to get revenge against the wrongdoers, and the wrongdoers are painted in such an unlikable fashion that you're just begging for them to taste a little vigilante justice.As for the good guys, well, they fall under the ""anti-hero"" moniker. They aren't scared to sidestep the law in order to get what they're after. But within the context of the movie you can't really blame their motives. Their mother adopted them when nobody else wanted anything to do with them. They were considered lost causes, yet she took them in, gave them a family, and put her faith in them.They didn't turn out to be saints, but as one cop says, ""They're Congressmen compared to what they would've been."" Now their mother, just an old lady always trying to do good, is dead and the cops don't seem to be doing anything about it. Wrongs have to be made right, and the brothers decide they're the ones that have to make it right.This is one of those movies that I figured I'd somewhat enjoy, but I walked out of the theater thinking, ""Man, I didn't expect it to be THAT good!"" It's rare that I find such a diamond in the rough, so I savor it as if I'm Rob Schneider at a stupid movie convention.One reason I had my doubts going in was I feared it might be drowned in loud, annoying hip-hop stylings. Plus, every Outkast song I've ever heard has made me want to gouge my eardrums with a letter opener, so I feared the worst from Andre Benjamin. ""How annoying is this guy going to be?"" I asked myself. But all my fears were unfounded. Instead, we're surrounded by a world of crooked cops, bad guys who wear man-furs, surprisingly good acting, believable chemistry, a couple of subtle twists, and a really cool car chase on ice. I'm always up for a good revenge flick, and I'm happy to report that this one exceeded my expectations.THE GIST Are you easily offended by violent revenge flicks? Then use your common sense and skip out on Four Brothers. But if that sounds like your kind of movie then I think you'll find this one works great within the genre.",Four Brothers

It delivers all the action you could want, a great cast including Mark Wahlburg, Andre Benjamin and a perfect story and in my personal opinion it's one of Wahlburgs defining roles along with other films like The award winning Departed.As with all revenge movies, you need good strong characters to carry the weight of the story.

82,seaview1,FOUR BROTHERS Returns to the 'Hood,6,12 August 2005,"Boyz n the Hood was a landmark film in its realistic depiction of gang violence and its effect on families in urban America. Its novice director, John Singleton, has languished in relative obscurity since then and revisits a similar turf with his revenge drama, Four Brothers. While it reconfirms Singleton's talents, it is an imperfect action drama that leans too heavily on its mean spirited revenge theme.A middle aged woman, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), is known for taking wayward boys off the streets and finding them foster homes. Yet, over time, only four boys could not be placed, and she adopted them herself. Years later, when a liquor store robbery goes awry, Evelyn is murdered. This reunites the four brothers who are now grown (Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund). What seems to be a simple crime gone wrong is only the beginning of a tale of conspiracy and betrayal. With police detectives (Terrence Howard and Josh Charles) seemingly a step behind the clues, the brothers decide to find the answers and punish all those involved even if it leads to corrupt officials, crooked cops, or the top crime boss in town. This causes violent confrontations and retribution until the brothers must attempt a daring plan to avenge their family and bring the murderers to their form of justice.As portrayed by Singleton, this is a tough, violent neighborhood, a sort of distant cousin to the one in Boyz n the Hood. There are some similarities with New Jack City with its family of gangsters and a ruthless leader. The film does contain well directed scenes. The pool hall scene between Howard and Charles is quite good and the dialogue makes this a mini-gem. At times Singleton knows enough to reel back his characters from a pure revenge tale to one of family and connection. There is a good early scene during Thanksgiving at the dinner table where each brother looks upon the memory and visage of his deceased mother in an empty chair and remembers the lessons she instilled in them. It is a clever moment and speaks volumes on what she meant to each son. Perhaps a bit more of this would have balanced the film and kept it from turning into the overwhelmingly vengeful tale it ultimately becomes.The film feels tough and gritty, and its characters are real people with real conflicts and emotions. The relationship of these brothers forms the backbone of the film no matter what they endure. They stick up for each other and watch each other's back. These brothers in arms love each other and fight amongst themselves. We anguish when they suffer and cheer when they triumph. There are humorous moments sprinkled throughout the film and some funny lines spoken at the expense of each character.The story, written by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, works on a couple of levels. On one level, it is a detective story with twists and turns and some surprises. There are some clues and red herrings along the way, and you don't quite know the whole story until the end. On another level it functions as a kind of urban western with its revenge tale. In fact the film is essentially structured similarly to fraternal, revenge westerns as The Sons of Katie Elder and Gunfight at the OK Corral. It's also about the love given by a selfless mother who gave comfort and hope to four wayward rejects when no one wanted them.The ending is a little like an urban Mission Impossible with its elaborate ruse. Some of it is implausible but on the whole the sequence works marginally. We don't know much about Jeremiah Mercer's family which would have added to our attachment to his character.Mark Wahlberg is an imposing figure who will stop at nothing to find his mother's killer.In fact all four leads are quite strong and well cast. Terrence Howard (who has starred in a number of strong films this year and is a star on the rise for sure) has an effective role as a good cop although his character leaves too early as the conspiracy widens. Fionnula Flanagan is seen too briefly and should have been used more which would have grounded the film morally.The soundtrack is a good mixture of oldies and serves as the pulse of the kinetic action scenes in the Motown setting. Technical credits for what is essentially a low budget film are solid especially in the cinematography and film editing.It is entirely possible to be shell shocked by the hard hitting nature of this violent melodrama by film's end. It's certainly a crowd pleaser and almost manipulative in the way it generates deep feelings. The film succeeds in terms of sheer energy and force. It's a little rough around the edges but still a welcome return to Singleton's roots. While Four Brothers proves that his previous abilities were no fluke, he has yet to exceed let alone match the promise of his first film.",Four Brothers
83,bob-rutzel,Good Vigilante Movie,7,23 December 2005,"A woman who had taken in and adopted four troubled youths (two white and two black) is murdered. The Four Brothers come together from different areas and want to find who did it.To be honest I originally thought the premise was a reach to get attention, and maybe there was some of that, but this was handled extremely well and I was impressed.The acting all around is very good. The story is more complicated than a simple murder of their mother and it unravels well. No one stands out, but that's okay. There isn't as much language as you might expect, but, of course, there is some. Everything moves along at a good pace and I was not bored at anytime. The car chase scene on snow and ice is pretty good.The most touching scene, for me, was the Thanksgiving Dinner the Four decide to make because that is what their mother would have wanted. It comes early in the story when you haven't made up your mind if you like any of them.

All the turn points in it were already used in other movies with some slight deviations.

""Four Brothers"" it's one of those movies that you enjoy while you seeing them and forget the day after. There are no blood rivers ,to shock you and to emphasize the feelings of the brothers, neither tortures ( like in most of other revenge movies ), to make us feel the impact of the revenge; which makes it more light and more entertaining.

85,fearfulofspiders,Definitely Exceeded My Expectations...,7,18 September 2008,"I will state it clearly: I hate street movies. However, there was just some element of Four Brothers that had me cheering for revenge every second of every minute -- of course, the main guy to root for is Mark Wahlberg who gives a pretty good performance. Terrance Howard is also quite good, and is probably one of the only three movies he's adequate in (Iron Man and Crash). Everyone else is slightly sub-par, and even with some okay acting, there's still some flaws that are too nutty to be believable.What worked in this film was the tension. From gunfight to fist-fight, Four Brothers is full of the intensity one would hope for in a vengeful movie. The only two flaws I could point out with the action is a) there is a gunfight in broad daylight, that lasts for 10-minutes it seems, and b) the climax is anything but acceptable in terms of delivering conclusions to our characters that are befitting.The music is not to my taste, and I will only go that far.The writing is all okay, minus the flaws listed above, and the direction is mediocre, but worthwhile.All in all, while definitely not for those of young age, anyone interested in vigilante films and especially ones about revenge might find entertainment in Four Brothers -- I highly recommend it to those in search of such a film.",Four Brothers

Not sure how the younger brother fit in, he wouldn't have been old enough to live with the others. They obviously haven't seen each other for years but acted like a tight knit family. And they tried too hard. Some of the scenes were awkward (the bathroom scene was particularly uncomfortable and overdone), the play fighting looked contrived. References to their rough life were never proven and Mark Wahlberg did his usual tough guy and came off looking painful. A lot of holes and dumb gangsters and dumber cops made it look stupid. Not funny enough to be a comedy or clever enough to stretch the imagination.

88,cdelacroix1,Deroit Streets and Four Brothers,6,13 August 2005,"I saw this movie last night and generally liked it. It has a very strong ""street"" flavor, ""hood"" flavor ... if you liked the flavor of Mystic River (I did) you'll like the flavor of Four Brothers.Of course as the title implies, the heart of the movie was the relationship of these 4 brothers ... and of their mother. The dynamics among the brothers as characters and their actions (persons and behaviors) felt very authentic ... and very appealing. The machismo and heavy testosterone level was perhaps predictable given the setting and ""attitude""-drenched background on each of the brothers that we're given at the beginning of the brothers. All the same, the expressions interactions were very convincing, to me, and often became poignant without becoming maudlin.This is above all, though, an action flick, and the action was non-stop and generally a blast. I especially liked the battle at the mother's house: a rip-roaring scene full of blood and bullets and attitude, and with a very authentic feel, again.The only thing I wasn't crazy about were a few plain mis-steps plotting ... like when the councilor gets into his car and somehow manages to miss the smashed out window of his car. And it was right beside him, no one getting into their car could have missed it in that position. Please.But that's minor compared to the rest of the movie. Good solid movie.",Four Brothers

Through their own investigating, they find out their mother's death was for more than just a simple robbery.Though this movie had some good shoot'em-up action, there was not anything special about it. Unlike 'Mystic River', none of the performances were particularly spectacular. However, Chiwetel Ejiofor (who plays Victor Sweet) does an awesome job as the villain. He develops a character that you really want to hate. In the end, you cheer for his demise. Terrence Howard (as Lt. Green), from 'Hustle and Flow', also does a great job as a cop trying to help the Mercers.Overall, this film was not too bad. But, there were a couple plot flaws and inconsistencies that ruined it for me.",Four Brothers

""Four Brothers,"" directed by John Singleton(who made his mark 14 years ago with the critically-acclaimed urban hit ""Boyz N the Hood"") returns to his roots making another gritty tale, this time set on the mean streets of Detroit. Four Brothers(Wahlberg, Gibson, Benjamin and Hedlund) are all brought back together when they find out that there foster mother has just been murder. Not only do they go and look for the mother's killer but they also discover a world of corruption and scandal. I must say that each of the four brothers were cast perfectly and gave really good performances. What I also liked about this film is that they didn't try to make the characters be someone who they were not. After viewing this film, I would have to say that this is the second best movie I've seen this summer next to the blockbuster hit ""War of the Worlds."" ""Four Brothers"" is a must see and will surely not disappoint.",Four Brothers
92,copper1963,Four brothers=four snow angels.,10,8 November 2009,"Timeless. Movie feels as if it was made ten, or even twenty years ago. Or maybe in the future? A revenge tale, competently steered by Director John Singleton, hits on all cylinders. Although this crackerjack, high octane thriller has a high body count, it is, I think, a very sweet film of brotherly love toward each other and their adoptive mother. The four Mercer brothers--two white, two black--reunite for their mother's funeral. She has been murdered, execution-style, by a couple of street punks. Hired guns. Mark Walberg is perfectly cast as the lead. He's one of the few white actors who would be believable in such a role. His timeout during a high school basketball game (to search some souls for information on the killing) is staged and plotted well. You believe he's a tough guy who takes no crap. Singleton's choice to shoot the film in the winter, the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, in a decayed Detroit, is the spot-on right thing to do. When was the last time you saw a car chase in a snowstorm? Sweet direction there. Sofia Vergara spins a keen turn as one of the brothers' girl friends. One small quibble: the scene where Walberg cuts the rope of a bad guy repelling off the face of a project, should have include the baddie firing away when falling backward, a wink-and-a-nod to Sharkey's Machine. The complicated corruption narrative has you engrossed from the start. Why would anyone kill a sweet old lady, anyway? The whos and the whys are properly addressed before the film ends. The last confrontation between the evil gangster (he forces a henchman to eat his dinner off the floor) and the good-by-default Bobby Mercer (he loves hockey) lead to a quirky climax on a frozen lake. Fish bait? Simply catch the movie with a comfy comforter and a cup of cocoa in order to find out why--and to warm you up a bit. It's a cold movie to watch. This flicker might give you a bad case of frost bite. No snow job there.On a personal note: The name Bobby Mercer (the more common spelling) always brings a smile to my face. The former major leaguer--ex-Yankee, Giant, and Cub--Bobby Murcer, was my favorite baseball player when I was growing up. He passed away last year at the age of 62. A piece of my childhood died that day. This movie resurrected it for about two hours. One last thing: I think the writer should have used the ""Murcer"" spelling simply because if you change the ""c"" to a ""d,"" it spells murder. An apt description of what takes place throughout this movie.",Four Brothers
93,eichelbergersports,Singleton returns with top-flight 'Brothers',8,7 August 2005,"After his disastrous effort in last year's ""2Fast, 2Furious,"" director John Singleton was quickly in danger of becoming a Whiz Kid, or One-Hit Wonder. And while his newest effort, ""Four Brothers,"" isn't exactly a ""Boyz N The Hood"" (his acclaimed, Oscar-nominated debut film), it is nevertheless a decent work with fine acting, crisp writing and terrific cinematography (Peter Mernzies, ""A Time To Kill,"" ""Tomb Raider,"" ""The Great Raid""). When a beloved Detroit foster mother, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan, ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood""), is brutally killed in what appears to be a random hold-up, her adoptive sons; hotheaded Bobby (Mark Wahlberg, ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""The Perfect Storm""), rocker wannabe, Jack (Garett Hedlund, ""Friday Night Lights""), sex-obsessed Angel (Tyrese Gibson, ""Flight of the Phoenix"") and levelheaded businessman, Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin  better known as Andre 3000 from the rap duo Outkast), gather to plan revenge. Led by police detectives (Terrence Dashon Howard, ""Crash,"" and Josh Charles, ""SWAT"") to believe it was a gang-killing and that their mother was in the wrong place at the wrong time, the four soon learn differently. In searching form the truth, they uncover an insidious plot involving a corrupt city councilman (Barry Shabaka Henley, ""The Terminal,"" ""Collateral,"" ""Barbershop""), violent Motor City crimelord, Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""Melinda And Melinda"") and a gaggle of crooked cops. The brothers meet force with force, though sometimes the picture threatens to devolve into a typical shoot-'em-up vengeance plot line, but Singleton knows when to draw the line. All the while, Evelyn appears to the boys but, unfortunately does not condemn their increasing violence on her behalf. Wahlberg, who has been really good in some films, but awful in others, shines here, as do the others; but the biggest (and most pleasant) surprise comes from Benjamin, who shows a dimension few would have expected from his rapper pedigree.",Four Brothers
94,pookey56,the four horsemen of....,8,22 December 2005,"when John Singleton released Boyz n the Hood, i thought wow, a young, brilliant director with a future full of potential; a young genius with more exquisite films to come. Four Brothers could be the best film he's made since then, pulling great performances from Mark Wahlberg who surprised me so much in Boogie Nights, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund, and Terence Howard, who is always so good. And the score in his films is usually so fine. i didn't know rap qualified as music until i heard it in Boyz. And it's great here too. this film is stylish, poignant, active, and has some very clever moments. I don't think it's fair to compare this film to his others, but it is in stark contrast to the message he portrayed in his first film, that violence begets violence, that violence solves nothing, and that the worst in us has a chance at redemption. his themes of poverty, hopelessness, misdirection, and role models aren't really here. ironic, since their kindly and compassionate foster mother mentored a sense of safety, love, and acceptance in their make-shift family. instead, what we have here is a revenge film, vigilante justice, well-constructed scenes of brutality and violence. the background details were just fine, with it's fargoesque winter scenes, flash-backs, chases, and personalities, unexpected turns of events. Four Brothers is an entertaining film for adult audiences and worth a watch. but i am still waiting for Mr Singleton to make another masterpiece.

96,spooly_montana,Wham-bam male drama at its best!,10,10 October 2006,"John Singleton, the director of such acclaimed films as Rosewood and Boyz n the Hood, brings us FOUR BROTHERS. Four men, from different races and backgrounds, are raised under one roof by a very strong and determined foster mother who cares for them and gives them a real home. On a cold, dark wintry night in Detroit she stops by a small convenience store to pick up a few things, and is murdered when it is held up by two armed men, wearing masks. The four men, having developed a bond as tight as true brothers growing up, come back home to lay their mother to rest. In the house, the memories come back. After the police seem to be getting nowhere with the case, the brothers take it into their own hands to avenge the death of the woman they knew as mother. The four brothers are played by Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin (from musical group Outkast), and Garrett Hedlund. Terrence Howard plays the detective intent on bringing justice to the victim in this case, but also not wanting any interference from the men. But the more the four brothers dig, the fishier their mother's murder gets, and there is no turning back. Filled with explosive action scenes, from icy car chases to raw emotion and street justice, this film is powerful in-your-face, wham-bam male drama at its best! Thrilling and funny - an action film with heart and a great story. I really loved this movie. I sat down to watch it with a cup of coffee, and I barely could take two sips. I was drawn in that much. Everyone can rally around these brothers that are 'gonna work it out.' To cap off the appeal of this movie is the awesome Motown soundtrack featuring Marvin Gaye and the Temptations, among others. Four Brothers is a winner all around. This movie is rated R.",Four Brothers
97,imdb2-5,"Painfully bad, especially with an all star cast",3,28 December 2017,"With an eye popping cast of talent you get a bowl full of cheese, replete with what are surreal, hard to believe moments of laugh out loud unintentionally painfully funny dialog and flashbacks of characters ready to wink back at the audience. In short, four adopted bad reputation brothers come back to their childhood home to mourn the death of their mother in a robbery, but later appears that it might have been the result of foul play.I knew this was headed for trouble when the film had a soap-opera like appearance. Four adopted brothers talk about their momsy moms in a bizarre, unrealistic and painfully funny fashion. There are no rules on what appears the entire time to be an isolated staged set. Did they run out of money for extras? It looked like a staged show you'd see on Broadway. Streets with no people, car chases with no one else on the road, outdoor scenes with no one in the vicinity except for ""the local kids"" who have a speaking part. It's bizarre.Nothing in this film makes much sense. Don't believe the highly rated reviews. They are either paid shills or have painfully low expectations. I happen to like a good number of Wahlberg's films, think Andre 3000 is a fantastic talent and the villain is an Oscar winning actor and major talent. It's all wasted on a script that is so poorly written that you must blame the writers, director and these guys' agent for doing this rubbish. This has to be a payback film for something.The explanation as to why the events in this film took place are loose - at best. They include every cliche in the book, good cop bad cop, hot blooded latina girlfriend,, a Wahlberg who can pull out his gun seemingly at every turn and somehow NEVER gets reported to the police or seriously threatened by anyone else in what is supposed to be a rough Detroit neighborhood. To say this movie was unrealistic is an understatement. It really looks, feels and acts like a stage play.Flashbacks of scenes with moms are painfully funny. All these tough guys reduced to tears, visions of moms moms. I don't know who drew it up on paper but it had us rolling with laughter each time they pulled that sideshow. And it goes through the entire movie in such a fashion. I won't ruin the ending for you but will say that, it too, has the kind of Hollywood ending where you just have to laugh at how poorly and beyond loose it is. What occurs could only happen in a movie because it was written that way. The movement of characters is also painfully choreographed. Nothing feels natural because it isn't. This is one of the most painful wastes of an excellent cast I've seen. Don't say you weren't warned that this is nowhere near the inflated 7 star rating this film has at the moment.

99,michaeljharvey,"A confused, mediocre effort",5,27 April 2008,"I didn't find this movie to be unwatchable or one of the worst I've seen, as many have commented on here. It's also not a brilliant piece of film making.The characters were so stereotypical and predictable (cookie-cutter gangster, generic tough guys with hearts of gold, good cop, bad cop, crooked politician, kind old lady, fiery Latina, etc...), it was hard to develop much serious interest in any of them. I found a lot of scenes highly comical; the problem is, I wasn't sure I was supposed to be laughing. When the movie obviously tried for comic relief, I just sighed. It was during the highly ""dramatic"" or heart-felt scenes where I found myself laughing hysterically. The dinner table scene where each of the four brothers remembers ""Mom"" was so bad, it made me cringe and laugh out loud at the same time. I think this confusion persists throughout the movie. It's never clear how seriously we're supposed to take any of this.The plot is full of gigantic holes and leaps in logic. However, movies do require a certain suspension of disbelief, so I'll let most of it slide. The characters are mere cartoons, so nothing feels real anyway. The most real thing here is the setting in Detroit. It looks gritty, cold, abandoned and dangerous. I'm sure Detroit residents weren't thrilled by the city's portrayal in this movie (although it may be at least somewhat accurate).It's hard to judge any of the acting, because the writing and direction are so uneven and mediocre. Overall, this felt like a decent made-for-TV movie. The plot, direction and acting were on par with a predictable TV crime drama.5 out of 10 from me.

Being directed by John Singleton and starring Mark Wahlberg it looked promising. I knew I wanted to see it after reading 5/5 reviews and seeing entertaining trailers of it. Eventually I saw it for a friends's birthday party, and I was impressed!A standout thing in this movie is that it perfectly combines the action, comedy and drama genres together. At times it can have you laughing out loud, others it can have you quite sad and on the edge of your seat in excitement viewing the great action scenes.The four lead actors do a great job. Mark Wahlberg plays a character which is different from what he normally plays and he pulls it off well. Andre Benjamin (or Andre 3000 from OutKast) does a great job too. He is definitely much better than just the usual rapper turned actor.The story is great. It has a much thicker plot than what would be expected from a revenge movie.

The twist at the end is truly unbelievable; while I won't give the details, let's just say that $400,000 isn't enough money to buy the outcome.Character development is nonexistent and many of the scenes contain ridiculous and extreme violence that insults your intelligence.

It made a good trailer, sure enough. But something happened along the way that turned a good premise into two hours of complete confusion. It's hard to know where to begin. The actors are all first rate and there is certainly some chemistry on screen. But what they're doing, where they're going, none of this makes a lot of sense. I found myself often trying to figure out a scene - is this a comic moment, or is it supposed to be suspenseful? Are the characters acting irrationally, or are they supposed to be this thoughtless? There is rarely any logic to the storytelling that I can determine, and the film stumbles into a series of random events more than I care to recall. Perhaps there's fault in the editing (there are three editors listed - why three?), but it's hard to tell where it went wrong. Even worse are those moments where I found myself thinking ""oh, he's not really going to do that, is he?""...immediately followed by the character doing what I thought no well written character would possibly do. At the convenience of the wafer thin plot, characters seem to lose all rational thought, and then moments later regain it. This kind of writing never plays like the reality director John Singleton seems to want us to buy into. I think he's got a lot of talent, but he needs to find better scripts, and better ways to execute them. Even the action sequences are below standard, and only surprising because they are so nonsensical.I wanted to like this one, but there's just too much frustration in the viewing, and I'll have to think twice before checking out Singleton's next film; this one is just plain bad. 3 out of 10 stars.",Four Brothers
104,BrigitteD,A family reunion to remember.,6,5 September 2005,"John Singleton, who has long ago established himself as a visionary director of groundbreaking racial and street-influenced urban dramas, offers his latest effort, ""Four Brothers"", a film which effectively blends subtle and exhausting psychological anguish with unrestrained physical manifestations of restless and violent revenge.The film, set in wintry Detroit, begins on the threshold of the holiday season, where Evelyn Mercer, an upstanding citizen, and the community's Good Samaritan of sorts, is gunned down during what seems like a random convenience store robbery.Much like someone who would take in an abandoned stray animal, Evelyn had made it her lifelong mission to rescue and shelter wayward youngsters who originate from a life of crime and broken homes.Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) are brothers, not by biological ties, but because they were raised together by Evelyn after her inability to locate willing foster families for them.Bobby is a headstrong individual, whom despite his salvation, has never much been able to leave trouble behind him, and has spent some time in prison, Angel is a womanizer who loves to show off his sexy Latina girlfriend, Jeremiah is a reformed business and family man, and Jack is an aspiring musician.After having gone their separate ways, the quartet reunite, albeit, under unpleasant circumstances, for their foster mother's funeral, and thereafter, assemble at their childhood home where they are seen experiencing a few private moments of grief and sharing a subdued, reflective and nostalgic Thanksgiving dinner.Seeking answers to Evelyn's unjustified death, the brothers begin to investigate, and soon realize that her murder was not a spontaneous act, but rather, a premeditated plan.Feeling that law authorities aren't doing enough to solve the case, the foursome set out on their own to locate the people responsible and to serve their own brand of justice, during which they encounter corruption from city officials and from a menacing gang lord, Victor Sweet, who isn't at all like what his name implies, and whose method of manipulation and control is to publicly humiliate his henchmen.There is also the arising issue of life insurance fraud, which causes a shade of suspicion and blame to be cast upon one of the brothers.The movie carries over distant echoes of a John Wayne western entitled, ""The Sons of Katie Elder"", with the vast country expanses, replaced here, by a claustrophobic setting of imposing tenements and cold concrete.The atmosphere nicely conveys a melancholy mood with its scenes of frigid, icy conditions which almost seem to melt away under the calm, smoky strains of Motown tunes.The male-dominated cast demonstrates the competent acting talents of, what is for the most part, an assembly of hip-hop artists. One such star is Mark Whalberg, who can also add Calvin Klein modeling to his credentials. Over the years, he has proved himself as a strong lead, capable of deftly and confidently guiding and supporting ensemble pieces, as was the case in the recent remake of another crime caper, ""The Italian Job"".Despite all of the action and violence, the film nonetheless succeeds in its study of interracial relationships, the hardships of street life and family values, and most of all, concludes with a satisfying payoff.",Four Brothers

The story moves along and does not step outside of itself. There are some intriguing plot twists, but the goal of revenge always remains. The performances are solid; we have experienced film actors and a director here who know what they're doing. Even the newer actors settle into their respective roles...John Singleton stated he wanted to do something with a ""western edge"" and in this film he has done just that. The story could be transplanted 100 years back and still work. While there is a great deal of action, violence, and bloodshed, it is not shot with an abundance of CGI or special effects...to that end, the action looks and feels more realistic.

Why not give these guys the power to fly and see through walls? Singleton seems to know that there are huge gaps in the tension, which he artificially tries to pick up with way too many gay put downs between the heroes, to the point that I wanted at least one of them to admit that he -was- gay, but no, it was just good fun, (although not for the viewer).The cast is good, and a couple of things are explained well enough, so 5 stars instead of maybe two.",Four Brothers

109,T1Thousand,Four Reasons Why This Movie is Good,7,18 August 2005,"All right, how many of us would actually expect a movie like this to be good or above average? I mean, many urban flicks or street revenge types are usually just average, so-so. But this, I must say, is a good one. The story was catching enough as it is. It might be typical or mindless at times, but it has its funny moments, its tense moments, and parts where you will be at the edge of your seat. There is really not much bad to say about this movie except that maybe the end could have been better and certain parts could have been delivered differently. But there are four reasons (perhaps more) why this movie is good--four main reasons at that. The first one is already mentioned--about the story being catching and so on. The second reason is because in this movie you get a feel of how close these brothers really are, regardless of their differences of race. You see them together as a family and act like everyday brothers when they're not out beating people up. And with that said, the third reason is how convincing the actors are, especially Wahlberg. I have seen him in plenty of movies, but now I think I will see him as the bad boy, hot-headed Bobby from this. He did a very well job as did the rest of the cast. The final reason why this movie is good is because it stays to what it is. It does not stray, suddenly become an intense drama or overly done comedy, etc. I think you know where I'm going here. This movie stays as what it is supposed to be--an urban revenge flick. Other movies like this take whole different route and stray from the story. I was afraid this would do the same, especially when it started explaining why everything happened. But I am happy to say that I am not disappointed. If you are into these types of movies, I'm sure you will feel the same. It was not bad at all =) 7/10 Stars",Four Brothers

112,TJ1380,It grew on me.,7,30 April 2006,"After watching about the first half-hour of ""Four Brothers,"" I pretty much decided that I didn't care for it. As I was watching this film, all I could really think is that the story of four very different people who were raised as brothers reuniting to avenge their adopted mother should be much more character-driven than the by-the-numbers revenge fantasy that I appeared to be watching. The film is well-acted, and it was interesting to see these four brothers fall back into old habits as they shoot, beat, or threaten everyone who gets in their way (they may be the good guys, but they can be just as bad as the thugs that they're after), but I just felt that it was too quick to get to the gangsta-style ultra-violence.My opinion changed somewhere around the halfway point of the film. There wasn't exactly a big revelation that suddenly changed the feel of the film or made everything come together, but something seemed to happen that caused me to see this film as something more than a mediocre Saturday night rental. I started to genuinely care about the four main characters, and I saw them less as the thugs that the movie tells us they are and more as heroes fighting against a truly evil villain. The brothers grew on me as it became clearer that they were up against the worst that the criminal underground had to offer, and as a result the movie grew on me as well. It definitely isn't for everyone, but the strong characters, classic revenge plot, and well-done action sequences definitely make it worth a look for lovers of action movies.",Four Brothers
113,missmissa,"Moving and Entertaining, if slightly predictable",8,14 August 2005,"I'm a girl who likes action movies. And while this movie has great action it also has great acting, which is something most directors of action films tend to forget about these days. I will admit that it is sometimes hard during the action sequences to tell who's who, but this only happens once and I think it's mostly due to the snow in the scene. And some parts of it are a little predictable. For instance, about the time the movie started, I knew there weren't going to be four brothers at the end and in about fifteen minutes I had figured out which one was going to get it. That being said, their investigations into their mother's death takes some interesting and unexpected turns that makes up for the rest of the predictability of the film. The film shows the good and bad on both sides of the law. It's well written with that perfect blend of drama, comedy (many of the scenes between the brothers are hilarious), and action. It is definitely the best gritty action flick to hit theatres this summer and more than worth the price of admission.",Four Brothers

This guy brings to his characters a down to earth, funny, essentially good Al though on the wrong side of the law. This one is one of better movies.

116,the_crock,One day Singleton will rise up...,7,13 November 2005,"John Singleton has all the skills to make great movies, this isn't one, but he is getting closer. I don't know what's holding him back, but I wait for the day when he makes a movie that will kick my ass. There is great subtlety in this movie (for an action movie), and the performances, from actors most people don't respect, is well above average. But in the end this is a 1970's revenge movie, with a hipper black feel. John Singleton's love of 70's cinema is all over this movie, from the look and feel all the way to the music, and it makes the movie all the more endearing.This movie only strengthens my resolve that this man will one day make a masterpiece, a movie that will make Boyz in the hood, a great debut, but not a great movie (not the classic that people try and make it out to be). What is good, is that after all these years, Peebles, Lee and Singleton are still making damn fine films, what is disappointing is that there aren't more black directors stepping towards the mainstream, with the authority and flair of these talented men.But what would I know, I'm just a snow flake from Melbourne.",Four Brothers
117,Bladerunner•,Four Brothers... One Mother... A whole lotta trouble... and fun...,8,5 January 2006,"Singleton finally hits his stride with this surprisingly deep character study disguised as a mystery, action flick. What a delight it is to find a truly color-blind movie that isn't *trying* to be color-blind. The fact that two brothers are white and two are black isn't trawled for the ""We Are the World"" fakery that usually accompanies dramas with mixed-race families. The brothers here are just that, brothers who have a common bond in the horrors they suffered before a selfless, loving woman adopted them. The relationship they share is admirable, by anyone's standards. The mother isn't portrayed as a saint, but rather a real person who had a genuine love for hurting children, and a knack for putting them on the straight-and-narrow.This film marks the first time I have ever seen a movie that was able to capture the deep, abiding love that I have for my brother and sister. Singleton shows his maturity in this film in several ways, the most pointed is the common personality traits the brother's share that obviously has been imparted by their mother. Her loving presence is felt throughout the film through the actions, emotions and relationship the brother's share. Sprinkled here and there are little flashbacks showing Evelyn interacting with each of her sons; it is done with great sensitivity and is very powerful.The pacing is crisp and steady with absolutely no lulls in the story. The plot is very believable, and the villain is not the run-of-the-mill bad guy. No punches are pulled vis-à-vis the violence, people die and the brothers do the killing. I LOVED this about the film; I am so very tired of movies trying to keep the principles sympathetic by separating them from the dirty work of busting heads and shooting folks. The brothers are on a mission to find out who killed their mother and why, and they are willing to do *anything* to find out. They don't spend loads of time arguing with the bad guys, or pretending that they will hurt them, yet never doing so. They march right through each situation, hurting and killing the people responsible for their mother's death, and it is *refreshing*. Men from the street don't mess around, they don't carry around lots of moral baggage, and this is what we want to see in a revenge movie. When we go to see a film like this, we want to see people do what we wish we could do to people who wrong us. Four Brothers promises to show this, and delivers on that promise in FULL.Typically in movies of this nature, character development is sacrificed to make room for the action. In this film the character development DRIVES the action. It is deft and deeply creative, a three-punch combination of script, direction and acting comes off like clockwork. Singleton has, at long last, found his niche in this genre. As a younger man he thought that poignancy could only be found in dramas that indict some segment of our society. In Four Brothers he clearly understands that relevancy is found in issues of the human heart, and what MOVES the human heart. In past films it seemed that he was only interested in touching his audience through the stark and painful aspects of life. In Four Brothers, Singleton is exploring so much more than the meaner side of life, here he is interested in dissecting the entire beast, and he succeeds with beauty and affection.",Four Brothers
118,whitakeroh,This movie lacks depth and weight...,3,27 January 2006,"I saw this movie last night, and let me say, it was bad. The villain ""victor sweet"" has moments in the film that do not even seem to make sense in any way, one second he is making people eat off the floor, and then he has kids eating ice cream in his house, and then all his ""peeps"" turn on him. This makes no sense. The bad guy in this was laughable at best, and the effort by singleton to make his appear ""bad"" are horrid efforts in film-making. The brothers themselves are as believable as unicorns. We have Wahlberg, who may be able to pass off as a black guy, he really tries, but then we have the white punk rocker who grew up in Detroit and acts more like a woman in the movie than a bad ass. I was happy when he got killed because he was like a square peg in a round hole. Outcast guy was decent as an actor, making him a bad ass in the film however, was laughable. In one scene he hits Tyrese w/ the force of a 4 yr old girl and tyrese stumbles back like 10 feet. I laughed at that, in real life tyrese would have stood there and then punched outcast dude's face in. The plot of this movie is laughable as well. I mean, your left wondering, what is the point of this? The scenes with the mom in ghost form connecting w/ each boy was also laughable. It was like singleton just threw in a bunch of people and said, act like a family, but at the same time share not one trait in common. I mean, it was bad. Tyrese Gibson is not very convincing as a tough guy. In fact, only Wahlberg is. Wahlberg is the only guy in this film that exudes even a small hint of masculinity. This movie is more about racial mixing then anything else. In fact, I didn't even like the mom in the movie, she struck me as fake and culpable. She looked more like a crazy hag who eats children at the thanksgiving dinner scene then the caring mom. And for 4 uh, ""brothers"" to seem to share not one thing in common is a mistake on singleton's part. The fact is, 4 brothers fails in its attempt to convey a sense of togetherness amongst blacks and whites. That was the main point, and it failed miserably in my estimation. Further, Hollywood really needs to develop black actors more. They are typecast all the time as ""caring gangsters"". I mean the cop in this film, the dude from ""hustle and flow"", he is a superb actor, yet every film he is in has to do w/ race. Let blacks do some films that aren't about race for crying out loud. The race factor has been beat into the face of every American for the last 30 years of black acting. OK, we get it, you suffer from racism, but expand your horizons! Let the Denzel in you come out! The guy who plays victor sweet was horrible, he was OK in ""serenity"" but again, typecast as a black gangster, his character was poor, he didn't look like ""killer dog"" he looked like a pesty child who needed to just be spanked. Annoying character development. I mean one more race thing here, singleton even allowed Wahlberg to call a sort of bad back guy a ""house ni$%er"" this is from the movie folks! Not me! I mean, that is a lame attempt to make Wahlberg look like he ""fits in w/ the black crowd"" please. That wasn't needed, and it offended me because it was contrived.",Four Brothers

120,katzinoire,Singleton Still Has It,9,10 November 2007,"Years back I embarked on a story portrayed in a film called ""Boyz In The Hood"". One thing I have noticed about Singleton is he adds dimension to all the characters to the point you actually care about what becomes of them-especially when they die. In Four Brothers, it's Jack. Not much is said about Jack, except you just know that kid was sexual abused at the former foster homes he lived in, you know that until Evelyn Mercer took him in, he had nothing to call his own. And she healed him of that distrust. He is the most sensitive out of the brothers, or at least shows it the most. He is the youngest, and it is very obvious how the other brothers treat him that they consider him to be the most naive. Bobby is the oldest-even though we never establish his age, his presence gives off that vibe. Jerimiah and Angel are in the middle-Jerry seems to have gone straight, managing to have a normal existence. Angel has the least amount of background provided, however we learn that he has a girlfriend that he can never say no to, who the brothers (particularly Bobby) torment endlessly.Apparently Evelyn Mercer was a Social Worker, who tasked herself to place foster children into permanent homes. You get the feel that this woman didn't just place kids in a home and walk away, she cared for them all and you know she was the type to keep tabs on them. Everyone loved her, so when she is shot down in what appears to be a standard gang robbery shooting, people are upset-however it is treated as business as usual in the area of Detriot they are in. Bobby pretty much is a criminal, chances are he would have been far worse if not for this woman in his life, however he is pretty bad. He has a bizarre split personality thing going on, one moment he is tenderly introducing himself to his nieces, and another moment tossing various weapons to his adopted siblings to go and get to the bottom of what happened to their mom (although his affection and protective nature towards Jack is shown as he simply hands him a crow bar as opposed to a gun).Evelyn makes a powerful impression in the few minutes she is shown on screen. We first see her preventing a boy from stealing some candy from a sort of corner grocery store. She knows the man running the store, and he plays along with her to make an impression on this kid that makes you know he will probably not be stealing candy anytime soon. She points out that the kid needs a big brother-someone for guidance. Shortly afterword's, the store is robbed, and outside of the images the brother are seen remembering, we only hear about her.Eventually it is found out that Evelyn, essentially ,was assassinated. The boys eventually go out and find out why and by whom. In the process Jack is killed and in that moment I flashed back to Boyz N The Hood, where the neighborhood boys carry a bullet riddled Rickie back to his mother's home and they all are reacting to the senseless death. Bobby is not only crying for the loss of Jack, he is crying because you know somewhere along the line he probably promised Evelyn to always look out for his little brother. The man is a criminal, he is bad, callous and at times cruel, however he does have a level of a morals and you know that Evelyn was responsible for this.The movie is pretty violent. But in that respect, there is a sense of realism, as the area of Detroit this story is supposed to take place is considered very violent. It shows that vengeance does, indeed have a cost, and that in the end, there is always time to change your ways. The final image of Evelyn (who throughout the whole movie has been seen by all the brothers except Bobby)of her suggesting Bobby stay awhile gives the impression that indeed, Bobby will stay, and be a better person in her memory.Another thing to notice about this movie is the genuine way the actors all interact with each other. The teasing and poking fun at each other, the easy way all the interaction is developed really makes an impact. There is a moment in the movie when the brothers meet with Evelyn's lawyer and Jack casually asks ""What do we get?"" and Bobby smacks him behind the head. Chances are, it was improve, as Mark Wahlberg did a great deal of this in the movie,however the chemistry worked well and made the movie believable.I gave this a 9 out of 10, mostly due to the excess of violence.",Four Brothers
121,Angel-Shadow,Fantastic film and plot that only lacks in few areas,8,30 September 2005,"As me and my friends do at the end of a school week about 20-30 of us go to see a film - film Friday to take away the harrowing annoyance of gcse coursework and such things a 15-16 year old boy hates. So before much debate i decided (from reviews on this site) that deuce biggalo:European giggalo would be a waste of time and money.After deciding to see four brothers i knew that it is money well spent. I don't plan to give too much away but this film provides a strong sense of family love from 4 completely contrasting yet unduly close people. It is a film with little if no special effects yet fantastic fight scenes filled with courage, determination and wit.Overall this film originally seemed a mundane plot of four people out seeking revenge but when you go to see it, you will be pleasantly surprised.There is only one thing that drops this score to 8 and that is that you never find out why the killing took place and exactly who committed the killing, but still cracker of a film!",Four Brothers
122,emeraldreprobates,Good all round revenge flick,7,8 July 2015,Four brothers is a good by the numbers action movie with just enough story and character development to keep you interested and the right amount of twists/red herrings to make it smart but never trying to be to clever. The movie follows the seemingly random killing of a sweet old woman who just happens to have fostered four of the biggest f**k up hard men you could imagine. As the brothers look into the circumstances of her death they realize her death was not random but orchestrated and covered up by gangsters and cops alike.

124,stereoplaysjunk,Marky Mark and His 'Funky Bunch' Do Us Proud...,10,20 January 2006,"If you'd have told me this time last year I would have ended up waiting for the DVD release of a 'Detroit Massive' style film with Mark Wahlberg, the dude from Outkast and Paul Walker's mate from '2 Fast, 2 Furious' I'd have thrown my popcorn in your face and laughed. Very loudly.Oh how wrong I was. I was dragged to see this film, against my will, but as soon as the film started and I started digging that Motown soundtrack I was captured.The story follows four adopted brothers (Wahlberg, Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson and Garrett Hedlund) who return the their hometown of infamous Detroit to avenge their murdered mothers death.Wahlberg is very good. I've over-looked him in the past, but his hard-man act in life transpires perfectly on screen and his famous 'school of hard knocks' stamp, works very well. Wahlberg plays Bobby Mercer, the elder of the four brothers, but not the most responsible. Bobby, the hot-head of the Mercer family is constantly pulling out guns on trouble-makers, much to the dismay of sensible, family orientated Jeremiah (played, surprisingly by Andre Benjamin/3000 A.K.A the lead from Outkast) Jeremiah, is the sensible younger brother, the one who's stayed loyal to his roots in Detroit and set up a family with reliable, rational wife, Camille. Tyrese Gibson plays army Jarhead Angel, more likely to adhere to his girlfriends wishes than anyone elses. The youngest of the four, and the brother who is the butt of most of the films hilarious jokes is Garrett Hedlund, who plays Jack and consequently spurs a ton of 'is he/isn't he gay' posts up here on IMDb.The film is very, very well written by David Elliot and Paul Lovett and includes some very hilarious one-liners (mainly from Wahlberg) and at the same time creates an interesting and touching brotherly intimacy that films like these often leave out in fear of 'offending' the big tough 'boyz from da hood.' Director John Singleton does an amazing job, we get four superb and extremely different characterisations from the great actors leading the show and watch out for the car chase scene (Singleton does them oh-so well) as it is one of the best in film history! All in all this film is wonderfully lead by Marky Mark who gains a whole new 'Funky Bunch' in Four Brothers and although it appears to most as a 'mans-film' don't let that put you girls off. The family network is superb and you can always sit there debating on which brother you like best A surprising personal hit of 2005 (which was a bad year for films I must say) and was defiantly in my top ten. An under-rated piece of cinema that will never get the acclaim it deserves, but will sit well with most people who venture to see it, be if for the action, humour or lets be frank - good looks of the Mercer Brothers.",Four Brothers
125,forhall,Like revenge flicks?,8,13 August 2005,"I've always loved revenge movies, and this one fits the bill because it has four brothers trying to find out the truth of their mother's murder. The four brothers are all superb in their roles, as adopted brothers from foster care that went their separate ways, who come home to find out who killed their mother and why. The 8 minute AOL trailer on the movies sold me. Also superb is Terrence Howard as a Detroit cop who doesn't trust his own who is desperately trying to find out what happened himself. The plot is well executed through twists and turns. Mark Wahlberg just gets better and better. He was great in ""Three Kings,"" and he is better here.",Four Brothers
126,sthapns247,Very well done action/drama.,7,13 August 2005,"I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie about a year ago before a movie I watched last summer and thought it looked very promising. A year later I had almost forgot about it until I started seeing commercials on TV and I got my hopes high. To be honest, this is probably the first movie that met my expectations.I didn't go in expecting the greatest movie ever, I mean it does have Marky Mark in it and I'd hate to think he's be the start of my favorite movie of all time. But I did expect it to be exciting, emotional, and engaging... And it was.One of the things this movie does best is show the love and commitment between the brothers. The chemistry between the actors was excellent and really added to the feel of the film. It takes a lot to get emotion out of me in a movie, I'm talking the beginning of Saving Private Ryan a lot, so I unfortunately didn't feel as much as some of the other people in the theater, but you know something is right when people cheer when the main characters kill bad guys and yell ""NO!"" when things don't go right. The emotions between the brothers also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times.Singleton is probably a better write than director, but he does a decent job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I've ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in Heat which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.Acting was decent. Like mentioned before, the chemistry between the brothers was great, but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often. Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.While this isn't the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.",Four Brothers
127,lukebenjaminjones,Motor City Masterpiece,10,7 June 2021,"I'm a simple man, if I find myself hitting play on a movie at least twice a year than I know it has to be at least a 10.Casting: Andre 3000 can shake a poleroid AND act! Love him in this as annoying as his character decisions can be. Marky Mark is tough but lovable and holds the patriarch of the family role realy believably. I won't mention everyone but the casting director needs a pat on the back because they nailed it!Soundtrack: I was going to start with soundtrack because it's that good but I held back. I'm a motown man already but the soundtrack fits this film like a glove.Story: gritty, funny, emotional and relevant. It always stays on track, solid character development for the amount of characters and time in the film. And who doesn't like a film where the good guys give it as best as they take it.Other: I'm not a big fan of films nowdays getting extra woke trying to fit some stupid Hollywood agenda or narrative of diversity and so on but this movie made in 2005 preached all these things and ticked the boxes without being preachy, woke or forced. This film is proof that colour didn't even need to be mentioned and it's doesn't even matter that these four guys were brothers with he same equality and start in life regardless the colour of their skin. This film did it first! To the point that iv watched Four Brothers yearly for almost 16yrs and only now with how crap Hollywood is going do I appreciate this movie for what it was.

128,subego,"Great movie, great premise, great acting and great fun!",9,12 July 2009,"This movie excels for one simple reason: realistic interplay between the entire cast. I am sure you have read many of the other comments listed here so I wont bother rehashing them here. I just have a few observations on why this was not only a great action movie...but also remarkably heartfelt. Mark Wahlberg gives a convincing performance as the family's lost cause. What is amazing is that we root for him to ""win"" even though the character really has no redeeming quality's save one: his love and devotion to his family. He and adoptive brothers, as well as a childhood friend turned policeman with whom they share a measure of respect and trust, all interact on a totally believable and nuanced level not found in many movies. The dialog and delivery, as well as the physical interplay between them all, becomes the linchpin on which this film hangs. They are brothers in every sense of the word, complete with petty arguments and intimate familiarity. For me, this makes the entire movie!It also helps that there is a viable antagonist in the character of Victor Sweet. It would have been very easy to paint him as a stereotypical thug boss, but directer John Singleton deftly paints him with a different brush, making him a villain of almost unbelievable arrogance. In Sweet we have an adversary for the brothers that heightens the level of building animosity and tension between everyone...brothers and opponents alike. It is also nice to see a story that plays itself out in the heart of a cold Detroit winter. In most films of this nature, the settings are invariably either warm and sunny or bleak and rain soaked. The discomfort of in-climate weather makes for a more interesting backdrop...especially during the car chase where there are hazards for both the pursued and the pursuers are obvious and exciting!So, to sum up, I thought this was a great movie! There are so many ways that this could have turned out differently, and a misstep in any area, be it direction, characterizations, or pacing, could have rendered this as just another revenge flick...yea, it would still be ""good,"" but certainly not the believable urban drama that are the final results of this movie.Oh, yea, one more thing, the filmmakers did an incredible job with the soundtrack and song placement! Using Marvin Gaye's ""Trouble Man"" was genius! Behind every song, the filmed scene thrived and bloomed simply because the mood setup was so well done. Watching Mark Wahlberg silently break down to music that mirrors the drama so closely was almost breathtaking...and remarkably effective!",Four Brothers
129,jdfcanada,Surprisingly good,10,12 August 2005,"Some may disagree, I think this is the best movie of the summer. I've seen all the big hits (several flops too) and this movie was by far the best of all of them.It has an excellent cast. All four of the brothers play their parts perfectly, and Singleton directed a compelling character driven, well written story. Wahlberg does well as the tough guy, Andre 3000 (of Outkast fame) does an excellent job as the only brother who made something of himself and Tyrese and Garrett Hedlund are great as the ex-Marine and failed rock star respectively.There is lots of action, but not gratuitous let's blow stuff up for the sake of blowing stuff up. Each action scene drives the characters to discover something new in the murder of their mother.There is plenty of humour too, just like in any tight family, everyone has their foibles that are relentlessly dissected and hit upon. The singer, Jack, takes the brunt of the ribbing, but his brothers' love for him comes out in the huge hit 2/3 through the movie.The characterization is powerful and one of the strongest scenes in the movie is when the four sit down to Thanksgiving dinner, without their mother, and she appears in flashbacks, gently chiding them and/or encouraging them.Going into this, I never thought that the best movie of the summer would star Mark Wahlberg, but this movie was so surprising, I may have to go see it again!",Four Brothers

This movie looked decent from the previews and I'm always up for taking a chance on a flick I don't know too much about; however, this shouldve been a path not taken. The plot was a mess of irrelevant dialogue and scenes strung together by a nonsensical story that could have easy been written by a twelve year-old with ADD. Seriously, one would hope that some factors could've salvaged this mediocre-at-best- movie, but not the action, actors, or even humor (what little there really was) did anything to improve it. In fact these things only dragged down this movie into deeper realms of film hell. In one scene (the brothers are looking for people who have information about their mothers death), Mark Whalberg busts into a crowded high-school basketball gym, throwing his gun around and screaming like a maniac. I mean sure, an action film can be unrealistic, but to ask me to swallow that garbage is unforgivableAs a final note, prior to this movie i can scarcely remember laughing at a movie, during the movie, due to how bad it was, i did numerous times",Four Brothers

One is that Fall/Winter feel-good, and more animated movies than you can count are coming to theaters. Also, it also means that the Summer Movies of 05 are closing. HOO-RAYYY!!! But wait hold on, before it is gone one of few good movies sneaks in. It is the new John Singleton movie Four Brothers, and what a good one it is.Four Brothers is about four adopted degenerates whose mom is murdered and they come back to their old camping ground to, one bury her, and the other, to look for her killers and bury them as well. It starts out fantastic, then loses a little steam, and at the end comes together perfectly to have you talking about it at the water cooler the next day.Mark Walbergh, Garrett Hedlund, Andre 3000, and Tyrese Gibson play the four brothers and do a fantastic job as playing the delinquents. They really look like they're right out of the mean streets of Michigan. They also act and speak like it as well. So if you're thinking about taking little kiddies (5-12) you might want to make sure they can handle it because there is enough profanity and shooting to go around.

132,ztanlines,a damn fine revenge movie,7,22 August 2005,"Critics are already dogging this movie because they didn't appreciate it for what it was. ""I hope this movie was meant to be funny."" I'm not exactly sure what they were looking for or what they thought they were sitting down to watch. This is a movie about revenge and vigilante justice, plain and simple; it doesn't flaunt itself as anything more or less. The characters are well laid out, and each of them very well acted (Marky Mark gives the performance of his life. Even if he were the only good actor here, he could carry it. And Andre 3000 deserves a round of applause for a damn decent job himself).Are you looking for deep discussions on morality? Do you want a grave statement about poverty and the downfall of society? Why are you watching this movie? There are millions of movies that focus very well on those topics. But sitting down to ""Four Brothers"" with these things in mind is like sitting down to ""Scarface"" in search of a romantic comedy. You're missing the point. This is a very good movie about revenge, vigilante justice and Mark Wahlberg dressed like Mike Patton and kicking ass.",Four Brothers
133,is_everybody_going_crazy32,Excellent Movie!,10,16 August 2005,"Four Brothers is about 4 adopted brothers (two black, two white) who's mother is shot at the beginning of the movie. The brothers have separated and gone on to do different things. Bobby Mercer, who's hot-headed and doesn't think before his actions, played professional hockey for a while before getting thrown out for being too rough; Jeramiah Mercer, who stayed in Detroit and runs a good business and has a family; Angel Mercer, who's a complete play boy; and the youngest Jack Mercer, who went on to become a rock star. When they discover their mother has been killed, the four brothers come together for the first time in years to avenge her death.This movie stars Mark Wahlberg in his best performance that I've seen, Andre' Benjamin who proves he is a true actor, Tyrese Gibson in his perfect character roll, and Garrett Hedlund, who is definitely the breakthrough actor of the year (in my opinion).I was completely taken by surprise when I saw this movie. It's everything that someone would expect when going to see a movie of this genre. It's got a powerful story, and has an incredibly strong script...probably one of John Singleton's best movies. The actors in this movie know what their doing, and make you feel a real connection with each character. After I walked out of this movie I couldn't stop thinking about the storyline and how each of the actors portrayed their characters. I do not suggest this movie to younger kids at all, because there's way too much violence and language...but I would say, if you can handle watching 8 mile, you are definitely mature enough to watch this, and I highly recommend it.",Four Brothers
134,Out-Break,4 Brothers - Better Than Expected,8,6 October 2005,"Saw adverts and posters and expected it to be another loud shoot em up with lots of blood and loads of cheesy lines. But it was quite the opposite, despite a quite terrible dinner scene with some slightly cheesy flashbacks this film still performed very well.You actually felt for the brothers, and also when they shot the killers it was like i was worried for Fairy which was kind off weird. But the comedy part was god, not to overdone but not so there's nothing to laugh about, and it was great seeing each of the brothers fight and have a good time. Also the gun scenes although on occasions were a little overdone and at times you did wonder if they knew how to aim they were still entertaining and again they never really went to far.The actual story was alright nothing revolutionary, not by along way but something in which the film could follow easily and so can the audience. And the slight twists here and their really did make this a film which i though i was going to hate into a film i would gladly watch again",Four Brothers
135,bbck7,Four lawless brothers depicted as heros,2,20 August 2005,"This movie is so wrong on many levels. The gun violence is so over the top it boarders on stupidity. Every cop in the country should revolt against this movie, it depicts them as stupid, corrupt unprofessional and ineffective. The heros are gun wielding, drug taking, lawless, anarchists, bullies with no redeeming qualities except grief for their shotgunned down mother. The movie takes place in this make belief world, called Detroit, where all the people are huddled in their homes watching and letting these four nuts run the world. At one point in the movie the corrupt cop walks out of a bar full of people with his cop partner, shoots his partner then pretends to act like there is another person there who actually did the shooting, gets on his radio and says he needs backup and shoots his gun next to the radio for effect. All this is done without one person coming out of the bar to see what is going on or anyone coming to windows all around the shooting. This is an ugly anti social movie.",Four Brothers

Despite a few hitches (how cliché this movie really is, I.E. revenge), it really did deliver. All four of the brothers delivered the flavor that this movie probably would have needed and I must say that the screenplay must have been superb. This movie pays the obvious homage to Death Wish and it's been quite overdone, but not without receiving the credit it deserves.If you like action drama, then I'd recommend you go out and pay the $8 to see it.

137,nereidon,not worth a dime,3,21 August 2008,"have seen this one the other night and i'm very disappointed to say the least. according to IMDb votes and reviews this should be at least beyond average with fine acting and a nice story. Now as i find, this movie has so many holes in its plot, one might assume the script got shot during one of the action scenes. ridiculous twists in the story, very very VERY bad sequences that are simply unbelievable and that do not make much sense in the course of action (sometimes it is like Charles Bronson's Disney) and a cast that doesn't fit together at all. Now i realize that this is an adaption of Katie Elder and that it might not be that easy to transform a wild west story into today's world, but still as a writer/director you have to take care that the story conveys some realism, otherwise it gets laughable/boring and you as a viewer can't care less for what happens to the characters. unfortunately the filmmakers failed big time here and all their trying to give their characters a life and the storyline a ground was heavily countered by their sledgehammer-style in every way. not to mention the unreflected use of violence against ANYBODY with a big smile on the face which makes the major premise of the film that the old lady did a good job raising problematic boys and changing their life to the better, a big fat lie. just do not waste your time.",Four Brothers

The performances are just simply awesome. Emotions are constantly felt through the film. What the brothers are feeling, so are you. The story centers around four men, Bobby(Mark Wahlberg), Jeremiah(Andre Benjamin), Angel(Tyrese Gibson), and Jackie(Garret Hudlund), adopted by a woman to get them off the streets. They see themselves as brothers, and are closely knit. However, they go their separate ways, and are again united once their mother is killed.

141,xyzanduknome,great movie,10,15 October 2006,Four Brothers is a movie that I watched with my family. It was a great movie. It taught me that gangs aren't all bad and that some are just trying to find answers. This movie was definitely a tear jerker. Garrett Hedlund played an amazing role as Jack in this movie. He played the youngest kid who had a rough life growing up which had scared him for life. Hedlund made viewers believe the role he was playing and made us feel bad and thats the feeling you should get while watching any movie like this. The best scene was the one towards the end when the bad guys try to kill all of the brothers by shooting up the house. It was definitely a twist to the whole scene when the guy came to the door and Jack went after him. That was the saddest part of the whole movie. But I would highly recommend watching this movie.,Four Brothers
142,MRT_,A feel bad movie?,2,13 September 2020,"The story starts rather promising, then they try to show you the band between the brothers in a lot of very small scenes that keep getting worse and worse. just when you are getting tired of this and hope for some action they kill all the bonding you very much tried to build up with the brothers. by showing a more ruthless motley crew of misfits shooting up a (lawless?) city with the worst police response of all time. 50 minutes in you either love this movie because you are a person that dont care about a good motive for violence or you just feel bad and irritated by the gta style murders & language that don't actually get you any closer to solving the consperacy... At least for me they killed the cast quicker than you can say daenerys...
If you still think lets watch this movie! then I feel obligated to warn you about the following. You still have to deal with the shallowest random latina character randomly starting to live in their house. What is she doing in the movie? It really doesn't add anything usefull and makes the movie feel even more of a joke than it already is.time i stopped watching 57:56",Four Brothers
143,stevegle,Cold and snowy,4,23 September 2005,"Lots of snow, liberal sprinklings of confusing minor characters, poorly structured main characters and too much action overwhelming what should have been an interesting story. A number of things were left unexplained or presumed but maybe we were meant to get so caught up in the killings we didn't always require explanations from the good cop.We are led to believe the four brothers are very bad but they are clearly good people underneath. As a morality play (check the depth of the good cop/bad cop conversation in the pool table over a crooked cue and playing tough games) it's okay but ultimately doesn't really get into the characters because elements are thrown in unnecessarily to distract us.They largely only serve to spoil the concept of four ""brothers"" in spirit looking to avenge an injustice.",Four Brothers
144,robedogg,"Knock-off all the d*mn ""I hate Mark Wahlberg"" crap and go see this movie!",9,14 August 2005,"I'll try and get straight to the point... This movie has one of the best car chases in recent memory, mostly because it takes place in the snow. I'm sure there have been plenty of car chases in crappy weather but this one was done fantastically. There is also an intense gun fight that will make any antigun/progun nut salvate. Check your ideologies at the door and just sit back and enjoy the ride. Benjamin Andree ""3000"" surprised me with his acting skills. There's maybe one or two scenes that struck me as a bit too much overacting (not necessarily by Andree) but the action and strong characters are enough to overshadow that. This movie has a little bit of everything that everyone can love. Older women will love the whole attachment to the mother deal and younger women will drool over Mark Wahlberg, Andree, etc (don't deny it... you girls know that's the only reason you have any interest in this movie). And guys, this is just a kick @$$ flick that you'll run to the stores to pick up as soon as it hits DVD... but don't wait, cuz it's definitely worth watching on the big screen.",Four Brothers
145,pineapple_1013,wows :),8,3 September 2005,"I expected this movie to be fun, but not particularly good. A basic shoot em up, blow em up, beat em up movie, the kind my little brother is very fond of. Don't get me wrong, that kind of movie has a place, but this film far exceeded my expectations. I'm not going to get into the complications of the plot, but suffice it to say that it's similar to a modern day ""Sons of Katie Elder"", involving an elderly neighborhood do gooder woman being killed in what appears to be a routine hold up, and her four adopted sons return home to seek revenge on her killer. The plot, while relatively interesting, and well pulled off, was not the main appeal of the film for me. It was the characters of the brothers that really pulled me in. Mark Whalbeg, who generally isn't my favorite actor, does a really good job as the oldest brother, Bobby. He manages to portray all the character's emotions- the anger, the grief, the need to be in control- but without losing the sense that this is a man who's had a hard life and who's made some mistakes. The scene of him breaking down privately in the bathroom was fantastic. Tyrsese Gibson plays the brother Angel, the ex marine, with an incredible amount of charisma, and Jackie, the youngest brother,a wanna-be rock star and former hustler, is played very well, with a perfect mix of vulnerability, naiveté,awe for his brothers and anger. The biggest surprise to me was the performance of Andre Benjamin (aka Andre 3000) who gave an incredibly nuanced performance as Jerimiah, the brother with the most to loose, a wife, kids and a job. His conflicted character, torn between love for his mother and brothers and responsibility for his wife and kids is amazingly well done. I wasn't expecting this. The best part of this movie is definitely the chemistry between the four actors playing the brothers. This is partly due to the actors and partly due to the crackling screenplay, which I think reflects the attitudes of siblings who grew up together perfectly. They constantly rag on each other, particularly on the baby, Jackie, including calling him sweetheart and ""cracker jack"". Angel and Jerimiah end up wrestling on the floor after Angel throws a piece of plastic at Jerri, with Bobby giving a running commentary the entire time. When Angel, Bobby and Jackie come across the shooters who killed their mother and execute them, Angel and Bobby keep Jackie back, trying to protect him. The best scene in the film is definitely the climactic shoot out at the brother's childhood home. Bobby's anger, Angel's cool assessment of the situation, Jerimiah's desperation, and Jackie's fear are all played incredibly well, and the chemistry between Jackie and Bobby at the end, when Jackie is shot and lays dying, is perfect. Definitely not a movie to see if you're not a fan of violence or if you get squeamish from a bit of harsh language, but, while it's a bit of far-fetched, though entertaining, plot, the characterizations are very real. A highly cool flick.",Four Brothers

It's a classic action movie for the new millennium with a decent revenge plot that has enough twists and turns to keep the audience guessing what's going on. It also has some phenomenal set piece action sequences; I can honestly say that there are moments where I can compare this film to Michael Mann's, ""Heat"".The film is not going to be enjoyed by everyone, it's not going to get critical appraise for the cerebral content, and there's no way that it will get any Oscars.

148,Buford_Lurch,Like a phantom punch...,4,2 January 2006,"... this movie somehow never delivers on-screen. Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund play the four Mercer brothers, reunited when their adoptive mother is gunned-down. The film focuses on their attempt to find out who she was killed by and why. Unfortunately, the plot is entirely too predictable, Mark Wahlberg plays the same old ""too tough / too quiet"" role that he has come to be typecast in, and the rest of the cast fail to deliver (blame that mostly on lame dialogue that leaves them looking uncomfortable) and there is no real believability in the roles. This movie does have one good car chase scene, and enough shoot-em up action to at least make it interesting enough for the action / violence film aficionado, but just rent it... it is not worth the cost of buying the DVD.",Four Brothers
149,gwenabe404,Well-done movie,9,13 August 2005,"CONTAINS SPOILERS I really enjoyed this film. I thought that the four actors had great chemistry and I completely believed that they had been raised together. All four did a great job, but Mark Wahlberg and Andre Benjamin stood out to me. Wahlberg played this character so well. Bobby Mercer comes across as a hothead who would kill his own brother if he had a good enough reason. Andre plays Jerry very well as the cautious family man who does not want to get wrapped up into the ways of his youth but after seeing his family attacked twice he can't look away anymore. The other two actors, Tyrese and Hedlund also played their parts well. Angel may have been in the Marines but he remembered his roots and knows family is first. Hedlund plays the youngest brother who is seemingly more innocent than the others very well. The film as a whole was entertaining, it went through a range of emotions, sadness, anger, humor and even a little fear of what is going to happen to these four brothers. The supporting cast does a good job, Terrence Howard is good as the cop who knows where his old friends come from. The thugs in Sweets gang were frightening to me. An added bonus is the soundtrack which is mostly old Motown was great to listen to an offered a balance to the majority of the film. There are some great comedic moments, some great action scenes especially the car chase. The gun battle to me seemed very realistic and not fake. Overall a film I highly recommend if you are in for a good character-driven action film.",Four Brothers

I'm normally not one for movies that are seemingly all about people getting revenge and lots of killing and fighting. I dunno..I'm not one for the action/drama type...unless it's a horror movie, and then I'm definitely there. Anyways, I was genuinely surprised at how good this movie ended up being. Each of the four brothers gave an amazing performance. Andre Benjamin showed that he's not only a talented singer, but a talented actor as well.The movie was much better than I had expected. I laughed, and I (almost) cried. It went through a range of so many different emotions and events in the lives of the four troubled men, all adopted when they were children by one amazing woman who became their world.

I felt like this movie was somewhat influenced on real street life, versus much of the hip hop garbage we see on TV. Mark whalberg did it for me in this movie.

The movie was an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end.I have almost no qualms about this movie. Great action sequences, an awesome chase scene, laughter, tragedy, and a truly despicable villain. How can you go wrong? Throughout the whole movie, I was trying to put it down, ""How could a movie keep this up? It is gong to slow down"" were thoughts that coursed through my mind whenever there was a slower section. Of which the dips in action were all well timed and weren't frivolous.All four brothers, a few villains, and the cops were all well developed characters.

The only reason I made it through the whole thing is that I'm so stubborn I had to see what really stupid ending they had cooked up.Mark Wahlberg has never been what anyone in their right minds would classify as a great actor. His goofy, cocky walk was right out of a comic book. No, wait, that's an insult to all comic books. Hey, Marky-Mark, give up the acting gig and go back to billboard modeling.The only bright spot of this whole disaster was Terrence Howard, and I feel sorry for him that this joke of a movie now resides on his resume between ""Hustle & Flow"" and ""Crash"".

154,TrueEssence,I adore this movie,7,7 April 2013,"I cannot for the life of me figure out just why I haven't reviewed this yet. But here goes.I've always loved this movie. I think I really wanted to watch it when I did is because I had a huge crush on Garrett Hedlund when I was in high school. So I was determined to watch everything he was in. Anyway, you have four adopted brothers Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), Angel (Tyrese), and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) who return home after the mysterious death of their mother. Now when I say mysterious, it was cold blood but we just don't know why exactly they killed her. We meet them though Officer Green's (Terrence Howard) description of them to his new partner. It turns out they each have some sort of negative connotation but who cares? lolThe story: The story is elaborate and can get a bit confusing. Even to this day I find myself always trying to pay close attention to figure out just what the problem Victor Sweet had with Evelyn Mercer. I always know that it has something to do with her being nosy about what Jeremiah was doing and getting mixed up in, but some things can get a bit muddled and I think the initial story is a bit overshadowed by the violence/action. Especially once it is revealed that the new cop Fowler is involved. Which those things aren't bad, it just doesn't particularly help the plot, in fact, it kind of obscures it. You just have to really pay attention, the story plays out but you have to make sure you're listening and watching.The Acting/Characters: I think they all did a great job. I think the casting was wonderfully done. The main four had great chemistry and I liked the idea of having a mixed family of black and white brothers especially since they all were bad ass. Bobby was a great character, the eldest brother who seemed to have the most issues. Jeremiah was secretive but not very discreet, Angel... the soldier, brash and Jack, the sensitive rock star baby of the family. The actors portrayed their characters very well. I thought the relationships were fleshed out well. I mean, say what you want about the story but these four were the heart and when Jack dies... (I cry always), it really makes them rethink what they're doing. I loved these four so much, when I first saw the movie, being the writer that I am, I wrote a back story to each one. We don't know really anything about their past, the moment when they have flashback memories at the dinner table was a great scene. That is when we can see how three of the four brothers remember their mother and Jack's moment with her is most compelling (even compared to Bobby's scene at the end of the movie).Overall: I've always loved this movie. The action is great, the humor is funny, the characters are likable and unlikable if supposed to be, the acting is good, the soundtrack is freaking AH-MAZ-ING and it's worth a watch.",Four Brothers
155,katfish38,Started out well and then tanked,3,14 August 2005,"This movie showed promise in the first 15 minutes, but Singleton proceeded to lay on some heavy cheese shortly thereafter. The entire movie was predictable, poorly directed and clichéd. The only saving grace was the acting talent of the primary cast. There were some moments where the brother's camaraderie felt forced, but lighter moments reflected a real family bond. In summary, the movie felt forced. It could have been much better if Singleton focused more on a quality script, and additional character development. They made sure to squeeze in a 'brother' reference in almost every scene. John, we get it- they're brothers. Stop beating me over the head with it.What could have been a strong action drama about love, loss and revenge turned into a poorly directed violent after-school special.One area which particular shone was Andre 3000.

The movie has characters that we can all get attached to. Even though the mother died in the beginning of the movie, they did a superb job, and it even seemed like a major jaw dropper too.

158,jstnosbrn,The way brothers should act.,7,13 August 2005,"I went to see this movie last night, and walking out of the theater I told myself I wanted to see it again very soon. There are unexpected scenes in this movie that made me laugh so hard my nose blew my slurpy back in the cup (I did not finish the slurpy after that). The chemistry that all 4 of the brothers had on screen was unmatched. To be honest, I thought the downfall of the movie was going to be Andre 3000. I was wrong. He was actually pretty good in his role. Having two brothers myself, I could relate to a lot of the bickering and arguing that the 4 brothers go through. This movie has great comedy, intense drama, sweet action, and a lot of Mark Wahlberg fighting. And I have now decided that a movie with Mark Wahlberg can not be good unless he punches someone in the face a few times. I mean, let's be honest, he's really good at that. John Singleton deserves a lot of credit too. Considering that the casting was perfect, the story was very interesting, and the acting was far better than I had imagined, I think Singleton did a fine job. Even if you disagree with the above, you cannot disagree that Singleton has a unique way of making innocent faces, like Tyrese and Andre 3000, and making them tough guys with an edge. Don't hold it against him that he worked with Paul Walker in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Remember that he did create Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career. All in all this movie was very entertaining and fun. 4 Brothers is definitely one that you should go see if you like revenge stories and want to see a great mixture of comedy, drama, and action (and who wants to miss Mark pound faces in?).",Four Brothers

Whats great also was the acting. You'd think Andre 3000 would suck at acting like all the singers-come-actors, but he proves you wrong. I was skeptical at first, there hasn't been a ""good"" John Singleton movie in a while, and i thought there will never be, but again, i got proved wrong.Obviously, this movie isn't for children, there is one gory scene (but I don't want to spoil it for you) and in the end, it was totally worth watching. There are parts that are funny and there are parts that make you want to cry. It really brings up emotions nicely. If you haven't seen it yet, I HIGHLY recommend you do, because it really is great, and probably more than what you expect (it was for me).",Four Brothers

Brothers Grimm, and Four Brothers. Personally, I wanted to watch The Brothers Grimm... I had seen the previews and thought it would be awesome. Instead, we watched Four Brothers first. I was at first groaning, because I knew what it was about, and I knew it would be decent, but I thought this was a movie to be watched when the satellite went out. I was actually surprised.The directors wasted no time whatsoever in getting directly to the killing of Evelyn Mercer... now most movies would have talked about her raising these four brothers, perhaps even when they left. I suppose for those who were confused about characters, that would have been good. Instead, they creatively at the start had the characters laid out in front of us. It all started at the funeral, where in the deleted scenes they had the brothers give a Eulogy. A scene I think would have done the film well to be kept, but wasn't. In this scene, first Jeremiah went up to say a few words about their mother, and then Jack did. He mentioned how their mother took him in, talked about it, but got too emotional.To introduce us at the start to the characters, they decided to let Green tell Fowler about the Mercer's. Bobby, the heavy-weight champion screw up (replacing what he actually said with a more appropriate word), Jack, the first class screw up, third class rocker, and Jeremiah, who was the rising star of the bunch but found a cause. This gives us a little background, and the file he showed Fowler about Bobby is filled with lots of paper, so we know then that Bobby has had a lot of run ins with the law.The director and everyone who contributed to this movie knew one thing... things were going to change soon enough. Soon they'd be shooting first and asking questions later, and they'd be focusing on finding their mothers killer. So instead of having things action packed from the start, the directors tried to show us a side of the brothers that later we wouldn't see. They showed us that these brothers were close, and whether brothers by blood or not, they were there for each other. Bobby, who's typically the one who comes off all tough, has his own emotional moment when he's crying about his mother. Whoever said the characters weren't really talked about a lot, didn't pay attention to the movie.So they share their moments after the funeral, and then its time for Thanksgiving Dinner. We learn here that Jack is a bit of a cook, and that the brothers really like Hockey. Now I saw it mentioned how in Detroit it would be more likely for them to play Basketball than hockey. I'd like to point out that this movie was filmed in Toronto, and hockey is huge in Canada even though our sport is technically lacrosse, so its possible that they were just going by that. And as for the people playing hockey, if you notice it is the director who is playing goalie which in one of the special features it shows the cast and crew playing a good old game of hockey. Each brother, other than Bobby, sees a different memory of their mother, showing us a bit of what was probably said in their childhood. Jeremiah being told by the memory of his mother to close his mouth, Angel being told by the memory to keep his elbows off the table, and Jack being told he was safe. The hockey game shows us a little fun side of the brothers, and then things start to get more serious.The brothers are seeking revenge, trying to find out who killed their mother, someone who was kind and sweet and wasn't the type to have enemies. Okay, so granted, they made a few bad decisions in the start, by just 'winging it' but they didn't care how they got revenge, just that they did. Bobby in particular has a huge criminal record, so he's not one to think seriously about something like this. You can say all you want that they seemed to lighthearted considering what they were set out to do, but you need to keep in mind that Jeremiah disapproved of it, and he was really the only one we can officially say had straightened out. The others were all screw ups still. Criminals, in general, are always light hearted. If its something you've done before, then your not going to sit up at night and cry because you killed someone. Your just going to act as if it never really happened. In these brothers eyes, each person they killed got what they deserved. Men in general don't usually like showing emotions, particularly crying or talking about how they feel. Of course that is a stereotype and isn't always the case, but in this movie, talking about how one feels about what their doing is just out of the question. We don't really know that these brothers didn't feel guilty about what they did, because it could have simply been an act for their brothers. We know Jack didn't want them to kill people, and Jerry stays out of this entirely when it involves gangs until after Jack gets shot basically. Then he stands up and kills someone to save Bobby.Overall I thought this movie was good. If the majority of people like this movie, that doesn't mean you will, and vice versa. So you decide if the movie sounds interesting, rent it, watch it, if you really like it, then buy it.",Four Brothers
161,lissener,"Starts out big, ends up small",3,2 August 2005,"This movie has some great things about it. In its story of four adopted sons of a passionate dogooder (""lost causes"" loved by no one in the world but her; she's as true a saint as any of Rossellini's or Von Trier's) returning home for their mother's funeral after she is murdered as a witness to a petty robbery, it is nearly Shakespearian in its tragic scale. But when these brothers in everything but blood lose sight of everything their mother stood for and the movie dissolves into a macho (and egregiously sexist) revenge caper, all of that early power is sacrificed. The mother's ""ghost"" appears to each of them in turn (more Shakespeare), but only--get this--to warmly remind them of their table manners. Singleton abandons this audacious device when it could do the most good: where is she when her sons are ignoring everything she ever taught them, and executing in cold blood the men they believe to have killed her? This tragedy of failed character is not acknowledged by anyone, least of all the director John Singleton; instead it is celebrated. After the adrenaline ride Four Brothers took me on--the nighttime carchase/shootout in an urban blizzard is absolutely stunning--the movie ended leaving me feeling sad. Sad for the boys, and sad for the mother.The sacrifice of one of the brothers, and of any character and honor the mother's love might have helped these boys build, for a murderous campaign carried out in her name, is the true--but overlooked--tragedy of this story. It could have been a much larger movie if Singleton had continued to use the mother's ""ghost"" as a device to show that the brothers were at least aware that what they were doing was out of anger and revenge, and would have been against her wishes. There was none of that kind of dialog. What could have been grand tragedy in the tradition of John Ford, becomes instead a hollow Charles Bronson fantasy. No; THAT'S the real tragedy.",Four Brothers

However, I couldn't help but think how close this is to the John Wayne old western, Sons of Katie Elder. The four sons come back after their mother's death, to find out that their father was murdered. They seek the truth and get revenge. One of them is killed, but they still get their revenge. Still a great movie, just redone and refashioned after 40 years. Four brothers is well written, and keeps you watching every second. You truly feel for the boys and their mother's death keeps you in suspense. Mark Wahlberg does a great job of playing the tough guy, but still is able to lead his brothers and show intelligent planning and cunning to do the job. I recommend this to teens and above, language and violence is a bit tough for younger kids.",Four Brothers

Better than the range of fictitious life and stories that has taken over the center stage of cinema today. Lord of the rings, Star Wars etc.Good photography and action scenes combined with the Michigan backdrop ruled the story.Wonder, if the director purposely choose to show so many non-popular faces.

I'm so glad I went! There was a lot of cursing and violence and a little sexual content (not a lot). I usually don't like a lot of violence, but the blend of funny lines with the violence took the edge off for me. Living and teaching in the city I do, I can really believe the dialog and violence portrayed in the movie. It's a movie that I'm going to pay to see when it's officially released.

These are characters that you care about and there is some terrific action from John Singleton. The evening car chase in the snowy streets of Detroit is a classic. This movie is highly underrated. All four of the ""brothers"" are excellent in their roles. The villain is really twisted and the conclusion is quite satisfying. In my experience, people who dislike action movies like this film. But it also satisfies the need for plenty of action. You will get into the story and root for the brothers. There are some very humorous aspects to the brothers' relationships with one another as well and some very interesting plot twists. Mark Wahlberg is at the top of his game.

His acting has not only got better, but I think this one was his best performance. Tyrese Gibson, I love him as a singer and not that many can sing and act as good.I don't really know which I like better his acting or singing, his performance was so awesome I don't even know whether to say I liked Mark Walberg's or Tyrese better. The other two guys who plays the other brother also are amazing actors and couldn't of picked any better people to play brothers than all four of them. I do hope that they all become something better in acting or as for Tyrese in singing, but to tell you the truth after this movie he should consider his acting more than his singing.",Four Brothers

The acting wasn't awful, but it seems as though the actors had ZERO script to work with! The dialog and premise were silly, the directing and editing were awful, and the whole film was just plain dumb.There were very few tense moments, and even they seemed shabby and cliché. I think you can do a lot better at the movies this weekend, and I hope you choose to spend you 10 dollars elsewhere!Mark Wahlberg was bland and unbelievable, Andre (3000) Benjamin was even worse, and the other 2 actors were barely even blips on the radar. john Singleton has proved himself to be way better than this!",Four Brothers
169,even0110,B movie despite big budget cast and director,1,14 August 2005,"This movie just wasn't very good, and the current rating of 7.1 will slowly decrease as more sensible people vote on it. The plot was silly, the acting was mediocre, and the directing was surprisingly under par. Think for a second about the climax where Mark Wahlberg (who must have been hiding in the snow, or dropped from a plane) comes out of the middle of nowhere, bouncing menacingly to ridiculous hip hop music, and engages the ""bad guy"" in a fist fight. Accepting for the time being that he came out of nowhere and that's o.k., why oh why would the wahlberg character give his mother's murderer the chance for a fair fight. Also, how about the very first scene where the two hoods rob the convenience store. We learn later that they were sent there specifically to murder the old lady. But in the first scene of the movie, the two hoods don't even know the woman was there until she screams. The idea is that we will be surprised later on when we find out that she was assassinated. That's just cheap. Now I'm not saying this movie was a total piece of crap, but the problems I've mentioned (and there were many more), are common in B action movies, which is what Four Brothers is. It's just disguised as something different.",Four Brothers
170,ctrock,great movie,10,23 February 2008,"i watched this movie, because i think john singleton is one of the best directors around. his boyz n the hood was nothing short of genius, and this movie was just as wonderful. the brothers were all standouts, especially bobby and jack. it was great to see josh charles in this type of role, after dead poet's society. i remember chitwetel from love actually, and this was a departure for him as well. even though the story is basically a revenge saga, it had its best moments in the fact that the brothers were bound together by the love and appreciation for their mother. it was non stop action for fans of this type of genre, and i highly recommend it.",Four Brothers

But the big surprise was how the movie explores the relationships within this family of four brothers and their mother. I come from a large family and it rang very true for me. The humour, the ragging, the arguments but when push comes to shove - coming together. When family knocks on the door, you have to let them in.I found the location, character portrayal and violence very gritty and realistic. There is no over-idealisation of life, and yet plenty of humour there too.I found it a very satisfying mix of human and revenge, with revenge being the very good icing on a great cake.",Four Brothers

Also, her death totally did not look like a hit. It looked like two guys came in to rob a convenience store and she was shot because she was there and was a witness. It seemed like the two robbers didn't know she was actually in the store until she gasped after seeing them shoot the clerk. I don't want to go back and watch the movie again to find out because it was not a movie that I would go back and re-watch. I thought the movie was good until I realized that the plot did not make a whole lot of sense. Maybe they did reveal why there was a hit on her, but to me, the movie did not make it clear enough.

All of the problems could have been easily fixed. I think it would have been better if they had taken it through the typewriter one more time. There was one fundamental flaw: here you have a woman who tried to fix delinquents like the four brothers (Wahlberg, Tyrese, Andre 3000 and Hedlund) but she gets killed and what do these brothers do? Use violence to find what they want. It just didn't add up. Still enjoyable;e if you watch it in the spirit of a 70's B-movie. All camp and action. I recommend it for a cold, snowy winter night.

175,adballoon,Saw it on video for free ...GOOD THING IT WAS FREE {SPOILERS},1,28 December 2005,"I got this winner on video for free {guarenteed in stock} It was so bad it mad me want to quit watching movies. Bad dialog, poor acting, I thought I was watching some crap on ActionMax. But it wasn't even that good and I didn't see the Dolph Lungren, Eric Roberts or Some French or Spanish or Danish or Canadian or Portegese Former Five Time Gymkata Champion in the movie so I realized it was a DVD rental and not ActionMax after all. What is Marky Mark thinking. Was it the opportunity to work with Singleton that motivated him to sign up for this garbage? They tried to make it Detroit like. Shots of burn't out houses, Closed factories, hockey and some other standard slum shots. It's such standard BS. I'm from Detriot and the only place they ever played hockey was in the suburbs. Detriot is one of the most segregated cities in the country and I guarantee you that nobody with dark skin past 8 mile road is playing hockey with a bunch of white guys. If there is any game going on in the city limits of Detriot it's basketball and basketball only. Hockey is illegal inside the city limits unless they are playing inside Joe Louis Arena and the Red Wings are involved. This movie had a disgraceful script combined with equally bad acting and directing. What bad guy works for a crimeboss who humiliates him and abuses him. They should have had him running a gang of Tammy Wynettes instead of gangsters. These guys are criminals, killers and business men and the CEO is going to talk about sleeping with one of the board members wives!!??!! I see this all the time in crappy gangster movies like this. In real life the boos would have been fired immediately and literally for treating the higher ups with such dis-respect. That's why in real life things are run like the Guidos do, if there is a problem with one of the managers they are fired discreetly with one behind the ear. Not constantly humiliated. Who would follow that? And yet time and time again in movie they have the over the top Crime Boss abusing people who are closest to him and responsible for his income and security. Give me a break. They should have made a real movie about Detroit. The brothers come back and are surprised that Greektown is now Casino Town.... Shocking. That they lived in the mostly white Burbs and that the people of color are actually starting to segregate the whole city {slowly} and that there are actually Black people living one the 'other side' of 8 mile in Roseville, the Shores and other parts of the city {at one time unheard of, especially in Grosse Pointe or St Clair Shores} The Crime boss could have been a real business man with loyal employees/criminals who loved and respected him or her. The Brothers could have hunted down the killer{s} without crazy antics like whipping out a gun at a high school basketball game.... which in real life would have a few of Detroits finest working it... a mandatory presence for years at High School in the inner and and High School events.... that scene was retarded. They could have pieced together the tragedy and confronted a sorry {maybe of course Christopher Walken playing an Arabic businessman which would have been perfect}crime boss working at some Party Store or body shop...located of course way out in the suburbs... Oakland county ....Way out in a good area where he washes some of his money at his supposedly legit business. The perpitraitors of the senseless act would have been executed immediately .... not because they killed the mother... but because the attention would cost some of the operations money... the real hanging offense for a crime family. The four brothers should have all been college graduates.... raised in a tough area but since they were raised right {by the martered and now sainted mother } they all left and were leading higher end lives instead of being a bunch of blue collar clowns {yes I know Andre was supposed to be in Real Estate}. This movie was bad, over-the-top crap. Everyone involved drops a notch in my book. It was an easy check to cash for Singleton and Marky Mark... they should be embarrassed.",Four Brothers

He does such a good job at it. Mark Wahlberg did a great job as well. It just really seemed like they were all true brothers. They all just worked so well together on screen. I just really enjoyed this movie all around. This isn't the movie that you would want to take the kids to see, though. It has a lot of violence in it, but other than that it's O.K.

It comes across at first as just another typical action movie, but once you get in, you realize that there is so much more depth. Each brother has a back story, but you don't get to know it, just the extreme basics, making you wonder. Take Jack for instance, at the dinner table, he visions his mother saying ""I know you terrible things were done to you..."" that makes you wonder what happened. You get drawn in the story.The action, obviously, is what draws most people in. But it is really more about family. How far are you willing to go for your family, and there is always a chance to redeem yourself.What really brings the movie together is the brothers themselves, the actors. I can't imagine anyone other than this group of guys in it. I didn't know Garrett Hedlund before this movie, but he was phenomenal. As the boards state below, every tearjerker scene involves him, because he makes it so real. he is the character every viewer identifies with best. He has that boyish charisma makes him lovable, yet he is still distant. I won't go into any further details, because it would give things away, but its the only good action movie that I have wanted to cuddle up and just say ""I love my family"". ha ha.This movie is awesome.

Usually, I find these ratings to be pretty reliable. In this case, I was seriously misled. Don't make the same mistake. This movie sucks.The plot makes no sense. The acting is miserable. It's boring and full of clichés. Normally, I like action films -- even when they're not great quality. This one is a disaster. Don't believe the last 10 comments on here. I could accept an IMDb rating of something between 4 and 5.5 for this movie. Nothing more. And it would only be that high because some people don't seem to care about a film's writing, acting, or plot. As long as there's a decent car chase and plenty of guns going off, then there's no need to worry about such minor details as coherence, dialogue, and and character development.

The four actors who played ""the Brothers Mercer"" in got in your face from the start and stayed there until mission accomplished. Well crafted, well done and the characters just crackle with excitement on the screen. A remake of John Wayne's ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" is no ordinary western here in Motown but the revenge mode is still alive and kicking. A lot of shooting but no bodies exploding. For those of us who have lived in Detroit, a mid-afternoon shot out with no police presence was just the proper end to a Piston's game. The actors gave the movie its life and their interaction provided the needed adrenalin. Director Singelton hit a home run with this movie and the ensemble cast produced the needed fire and warmth. The police had crooks and good guys and the local politicans were scum bags but the ""good"" guys win out. The plot twists at the end were really simple but totally unexpected.

And if you're a film nerd like myself, you'll appreciate the crisp cinematography and seamless editing. I can't believe this is the same Singleton director that just recently did the CG infested, cheesy ""2 Fast 2 Furious"".

182,OutThere129,"Has ups and downs, but worth seeing",6,20 August 2005,"Just a bit of forewarning, this review is going to include spoilers.After watching this movie, I found that the movie marketing industry is going downhill, as all of my predictions for the movie were right. For example, when a movie titled ""FOUR Brothers"", and you see the names and faces of actors Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, and Andre Benjamin, it becomes natural to assume one of two things: a.) Garret Hedlund (the fantastic actor who plays the fourth brother) dies, or b.) Someone in the whole movie making process to preview editing process can't count. The former of the two would be the accurate one. The movie also has a lot of open ends, such as what was so bad about these kids that they couldn't get a home elsewhere? The movie does a little development of character for each of the brothers, mostly on present development, giving very little to the past.The acting on the other hand was awesome. Mark Wahlberg always does good as a leading man and continues his reputation with this movie. Tyrese Gibson, who is an emerging actor from the past 9 years, plays the stereotypical role you'd expect to see someone of his stature playing, in other words, the guy who is pimping the girl and running around shooting things. Andre Benjamin plays the more successful of the brothers and did a fine job at creating the feel of someone who started out bad but then turned right, making character acknowledgements towards a rough past, but standing as a firm family oriented man. Garret Hedlund does, in my opinion, his best job yet, being a very new actor on the scene, showing through consistently noted childhood trauma through an emotional, almost terrified, face, as well as establishing a very human character who is used to getting picked on and just roles with it (as many people do).The plot is good, it makes sense, much more than most movies that are made these days. It follows the story of likely events. It does carry its brief surrealistic points used for cinematic purposes, but the majority of the events actually are a possible reality for some people to go through.Altogether, I'd say this was an Okay to Good movie, not something I would bother seeing twice, but one I might consider buying when it comes out on DVD.",Four Brothers

I really broke down when Bobby Mercer (Wahlberg) was like ""you cant die. you're our angel."" and then he like had tears in his eyes and then he died. I was like ""oh my gosh! this is so sad!""

That is the plot of John Singleton's new film, ""Four Brothers."" It is also the plot of Henry Hathaway's 1965 ""The Sons of Katie Elder,"" starring John Wayne and Dean Martin. The new version stands on it's own: it's an extremely entertaining vendetta film about four young men who, despite their differing ethnic backgrounds, are obviously brothers. The love between them is palpable and that is what sets this film apart from others which may be as technically proficient as this one but lack it's humanizing element. The cast is great. Mark Wahlberg is in his element - I am now fully prepared to forgive him for ""Planet of the Apes!"" Andre Benjamin of Outkast is superb as the one brother who has, at least on the surface, ""gotten it together"" and has the most to lose. I saw this film a week after having seen ""Hustle and Flow"" (which was produced by John Singleton) and Terrence Howard is as commanding in this film as he was in the other. The man has star power.",Four Brothers
186,TheDoDoBird,John Singelton insists once again that people are one dimensional stereotypes.,3,4 December 2005,"Singleton has directed yet another poor, unbelievable movie. He must think people pretty dumb, to continually take his movies in such a childish and obvious direction. The film oversimplifies human emotion and insists on stereotyping its cast of characters. Just like the seven dwarfs of Snow White, the characters of Four Brothers are spelled out for you almost immediately with no later development to come. In case you can't gather this from the writing, Singleton is there to shove it in your face. On top of this, the chemistry and love needed to bring this film together and bind these men, just isn't there. The relationships are not believable. Not only are the relationships not believable, the characters themselves are not believable as tough guys. Even Mark Wahlberg, who always manages to pull it off, has trouble finding the rage needed to show the vengeful hate the film intends.Although the movie does show a tiny glimpse of a good whodunnit, it is handicapped by a cheap screenplay delivered with false characters and false emotions. Terrence Howard and Mark Wahlberg who are both dynamic and rangeful actors, should be given a head start on this one so to speak because after all, they were working with John Singleton and the ""Four Brothers"" script.",Four Brothers
187,swILLIAMS5510,Waste of time,1,10 February 2007,"Some marginal actors got coaxed into this nothing-but-violence waste of time. Bunch of unruly people with guns shooting at each other (and the bad guys are the worst marksmen). Cars chase each other, crash but still keep going. They crash again and still keep going. A few more times, crash, BANG. Nobody is around to see or hear what must have been a loud chase although it is in the middle of a city. And how convenient for nobody else to be on the road. Bad guys, good guys. Bad cops, good cops. And more stuff you've never seen before. The real victims in this one were the people who wasted money to watch it.The end (thought it would never get there)",Four Brothers

Had a very good Motown soundtrack that was well fitted into the scenes. I believed in the characters but found the foster mother almost sickly sweet, and the flashbacks where she was sitting at the table annoying. When suspicion fell on the older brother it started to get interesting, but then the suspicions were dropped almost instantly - which was hard to believe. I did enjoy seeing a film set in a non typical (movie) US city (detroit) though.Of course I wasn't expecting something deep, I was looking for an entertaining film with a few explosions - but disappointingly at the end of the day I just couldn't get interested. This is a rent - but wait till its off new release film.",Four Brothers

Once I saw this movie, I just had to watch all of Garrett Hedlunds movies, and I just so happen to have all of them on DVD, I didn't even know that until I figured out what other movies he was in. Anyway, all the actors played there part in the movie very well. Like Jerry, the responsible brother, but he is hiding pretty well that he has a little problem that he does hide very well. and the older brother does play is part very well also. He caring mostly about Jack since he is the youngest, but he also is hard on the all of the bros too. Angel just, he just gets he part done perfectly, I could go on, and on, about how well this movie was written and acted. I love this movie so much! P.S. Jack is so hot!",Four Brothers

Jack was the young one.. so different from all the others.. i love how they always took care of him and how adorable he was.. Jeremiah wasn't really as interesting as the other three, but he was always the one that strived towards the future. Angel was the loyal, macho one with his crazy girlfriend..The movie was great. This would have been the best movie i have ever seen if Jack hadn't died. That ruined the rest of the movie for me because nothing seemed to matter after Jackie was killed. It was so sad and heartbreaking.",Four Brothers

I found the idea original and I wish the director had used those ideas a little more fully to give the viewer a better feel for the characters' emotions other than ""Mom's dead, I'm mad"". The characters' reactions to the events in the movie were relatable and believable. I thought the actors fit their characters very well and that the awards were well-deserve.

But when I borrowed the DVD, I was surprised by how well made it actually was. It shows scenes of the brothers doing and saying things you can see real brothers do that makes the characters memorable and makes this movie very real, relatable and fresh from what we see now in Hollywood. It's a great mix of drama, action, and humor with (if you pay close close attention to what they say) a great storyline. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it's definitely a great, refreshing film worth watching!",Four Brothers
195,mythorig,Surprised at how good it actually was...,10,14 August 2005,I just saw this movie today & was very surprised at how good it was. I thought it was going to be the typical gangsta rap movie but it wasn't; there was really a storyline. The chemistry between the actors made you believe they were brothers--their bond was that strong. They even acted like brothers picking on each other all the time. I also believed they loved their mother & I that they were a family. One moment you were laughing at these guys; the next you were in shock & total silence at what they were going through. You felt for these guys. Lots of violence but it fit the story. It was great! A movie to get when it comes out on DVD... I will definitely see it again.,Four Brothers
196,Zana16,"A perfectly balanced emotional roller-coaster, with some humor thrown in!",10,7 April 2006,"I knew little or nothing about this movie before I went to it, but it captured my attention immediately. The characters of the four brothers, obnoxious, violent and ruthless though they are in turn, are appealing from the very beginning. Mark Wahlberg is on superb form in this movie, and Garrett Hedlund, as the abused youngest brother, is amazing. The jokes are well timed and balance the serious stuff very well. Apart from anything else, this is a very good murder mystery, with twists and turns all the way. Although the cast is made up of relatively unknown actors, they each play their parts to perfection. There are some brilliant stunts as well. The brothers work well together, and are perfectly believable as a real, misfit family. Fionnuala Flanagan, who appears at intervals throughout the film, adds a softer touch to a film that could otherwise have gone too far down the route of gangsters for it to be believable. No loose ends were left, it was tightly written, and the perfect length. 10 out of ten",Four Brothers
197,bloodshotFanatical,A mediocre movie,6,13 August 2005,"I came to this movie not expecting much. And I wasn't disappointed. I gave it a six because it really isn't an awful film. The problem though is it's not a good film either. This is to be expected by those who are familiar with Singleton's previous endeavors but to those who aren't, this should be always remembered.I won't bother with retelling the premise of the movie because if you've heard anything about it, you've heard everything there is concerning this film. Four brothers get back together to avenge their mother. That's all it is. There are no interesting side-plots; no particular character development (what the characters are in the beginning is how they wind up in the end). There is only one major action sequence that looks like it consumed most of the budget.Save this one for the dollar theater when there's nothing better to watch. It's certainly watchable; it's place on the list of movies to watch, however, is rather low.",Four Brothers

The plot was strong, and there were no slow parts in the movie, it just kept moving along. The acting was very good, and I especially liked Garrett Hedlund, who played Jack Mercer, the youngest brother. He was also in ""Friday Night Lights"" and ""Troy"", and we will definitely be seeing more of him in the future. There was a ton of action, so that was a plus for me. It was all very well planned out, and it reminded me (as many people are saying) of the old Westerns. Although it is a very serious movie, parts of it have a lot of humor. Of course, all of the brothers like to pick on Jack, the youngest, by cracking jokes and doing many other things that I can't describe. A warning though: it was extremely violent, crude, and graphic, and it NOT for kids. It was also extremely sad in some parts, and I had tears in my eyes. I NEVER cry at movies, so it must be extremely sad at some points. Overall though, it was very good, and when this comes out on DVD, I will be first in line to buy it.",Four Brothers
199,jann213a,"--This was an unexpectedly good movie--not great, but good",10,12 August 2005,"John Singleton is the only contemporary director willing to take on the sensitive subjects of society. This film depicted society as it really is not Hollywood style. There are real-life people of different races and backgrounds that live an love together understanding and appreciating differences and each other. This film was about the bad guys going after the ""badder"" guys. However, the bad guys, had a good reason and enough redeeming qualities that made them look like ""good guys"". The film was nothing more that good entertainment. Not plausible, not probable but for those of us who do not live in that environment, who knows--maybe this happens all the time. Maybe police and political corruption are still rampant in big cities and maybe, those who are wronged are compelled to fight back in any way the can. It was good to see Mark Walberg again, he's been gone too long from the big screen. Tyrese has become a promising actor. I fear he is and will continue to be type-cast like most black actors, as ""the big black guy"" that people fear. The interaction between the 4 brothers was great to see. I am sure there are many women in the world like the mother of these guys, that no one ever talks about.

Hilariously bad.""I love you cos u is ma bro "" and ""we love our momz"".This film has all the empathy and heart of dead wooden fish in a bucket of sand.Right from the start the 4 ""brothers"" seem totally unconnected to each other. They however love each other even thou its not clear as to why they should.But no worries they get back up to speed by talking to some random barman.Then follows the usual infinite bullets and car chase scenes (YAWN).Im sure the script was written by a 13 year old boy in the projects as a school project.",Four Brothers

It amazes me how films like these even get the green light. The editing was just plain awful. There's countless scenes where I just started to laugh at how poorly written most of the dialogue was. And who the heck was the casting director. The punk rocker brother is an abysmal actor. Family connections? I don't advise this but if you ever watch this movie again just watch him. It's plain terrible. Andre 3000 did an O.K. job considering he has no formal acting background. I'd still rather see him making good music which he does very well. Marky Mark didn't shine too brightly either. I advise anyone that has good taste in movie's to just stay away. Why is this averaging more than a 3 on this website? A 7.2!!

I thought Garrett Hedlund actually did very well also. I was surprised. I haven't heard much about him, and was pleasantly surprised at his character/acting. Tyrese had charisma, and Mark Wahlberg was great, which he usually is, in my opinion. This movie was very touching, funny at times, action-packed.. it was definitely worth the price of admission!

203,dbond-5,This movie was awful,1,16 August 2005,"This movie was awful. It had no socially redeeming value. The plot was implausible and stupid. The violence was gratuitous. What happened to good guys? There were no good guys at all in this movie. Everyone in the movie had some serious moral failing. The brothers brutally murdered others and showed absolutely no remorse or met any consequences. I guess the movie is teaching that everyone can kill indiscriminately and get away with it. The director is reportedly recorded to have compared this to a Western. I don't think John Wayne, Roy Rogers or the great Ronald Reagan would consider this garbage comparable to any of the Westerns in which they starred. This movie was horrific and had taught only bad morals. Once again, liberal Hollywood has no clue as to what the heartland considers moral. Unfortunately, this movie was the number one box office movie this weekend and the theater where I viewed it was packed. I don't understand why anyone would find this tripe entertaining.",Four Brothers

The characters' dialogue seems real enough and their parts were played with nuance and subtlety for the most part. The brothers showed genuine affection for each other without overdoing it. ***SPOILERS*** I especially appreciated how, after they had disabled the bad guys, they carried through and actually killed them without either of the now trite, politically correct methods of either saying something like, ""You are/he is not worth it."" and waiting for the cops, or the imminent danger angle where the beaten person comes up with a weapon and is killed in the nick of time, thereby allowing the hero to seem that much more heroic.

The story was such a good one and easy to follow. It is the kind of movie that from the beginning to the end, you are so in tune with the movie. The action scenes were so realistic and well directed. This is a movie that is fine for teenagers and adults to see.

I do have one thing to say......that movie was OFF the CHAINNNNNNNNNN. For the uninitiated, that means that it was a really great movie. Everyone in the theatre i saw it in agrees with me. I'm surprised that 2 rappers, an R&b artist, and a guy that has only done 2 movies, did such a great job in this movie. Honestly i'm no movie critic, i just like to watch movies and this has got to be the best movie i've seen this year. It was chock full of action from beginning to end, Mark Walbergh did an excellent job of playing a hot head, you can feel his blood boiling when he gets angry. Tyrese also does a good job being the 2nd angriest but more rational brother. Andre Benjamin is the peaceful one who doesn't want any trouble unless you put his family in danger(when you see you'll know, but that isn't a spoiler...trust me i wouldn't do that to you). Garret hedlund, does a great job as the youngest brother who they affectionately call their sister, lol, he's the kid who wants to go along but they always tell him to stay back, but he does a very good job nonetheless. These actors did a great job establishing the love they had for their mother and each other. I felt their pain, their anger, and their happiness. And there are enough jokes, not too many, but just enough to give you a good laugh and keep the action going. All in all if you look at the comments i've posted, you will see how much i liked this movie, because i haven't commented on any other movie....i think.

215,pheobe_sweetie,Best Movie I've seen all Year,10,10 January 2006,"Personally I have no doubts in my mind this is the best movie of 2005, and on of the best I've ever seen. One thing I really like the fact that you know Evelyn Mercer dies going into the film. In almost every commercial I saw it pretty much showed her getting shot. That really helps the movie hit the ground running, and if not for that fact they couldn't make any of the rest of the movie worth watching. Another thing is that they didn't use actors that are way over-publicized and you see in just about every other film, although I know that Mark Wahlburg is getting pretty famous. And, although I have misgivings about some people famous for their music acting, Andre' Benjamin actually does a good job as Jerry. The best thing though is how they make the brothers' relationships so believable in what, admittedly, a pretty unbelievable situation. And if you like this movie check out 'the Boondock Saints', and if you're a Mark Wahlberg fan see the movie 'Three Kings'.",Four Brothers

This movie is bad on many levels, the most egregious is on the credibility. It's ridiculous. On the acting level it is not a movie that any of the actors involved should include on their resume. I was under the impression that Wahlberg was a decent actor. He's terrible in this. I saw Chewi in Dirty Pretty Things where he was very good. He's terrible in this. Seeing so many bad performances in one movie leads you to believe that the director was the fault. That seems to be the common denominator. One could throw some blame to the writers also. Badly written, but in keeping with the quality of the film as a whole. I can't think of one believable character or believable situation in the whole mess.

It ranged from Cheese verging on the ridiculous (round the table scene). The film was dressed up as a touching revenge action thriller but lacked grit and reality. As if the cops would let you go after a gunfight where half a dozen gangsters get killed, Police say defending your home thats fine boys carry on.For me it really lacked the touch that some of Singletons previous work had, the cast were OK. Andre 3000 looks to have natural potential with good screen presence. Marky Mark's lead was just average and lacked conviction in the part.

219,catmistakes,Modern adaptation of Brothers Karamazov,9,4 October 2005,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but the title drew me in. I think this modernized version of Dostoevsky's Brother's Karamazov is more moving and more direct, though less obvious, than Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors, definitely producing more of the passion involved with the brothers and the strife created by their father (Sweet becomes Fyodor Karamozov, the tyrant/villain) than Allen can even approach (I believe Allen bites off more than anyone can chew, making one film from Crime and Punishment AND Brother's Karamazov, two entirely different and unrelated stories). The characters are not a direct match, but it is easy to see that Jeremiah becomes Ivan (this may be casting, André is the perfect Ivan), and Angel becomes Dimitri, which makes Sofí into Grushenka/Katerina, both the harlot and the betrothed, but the love triangle is only suggested by Sweet mentioning that he has a date with a Latino. The other two brothers are more difficult to place, though it is more likely that Bobby is Alyosha Karamazov (the novel's hero) and that leaves Jack to become Smerdyakov, (the illegitimate son), but this is also reversed because in the novel it is Smerdyakov that kills Fyodor, not Alyosha, but Smerdyakov also commits suicide. At any rate, I am sure there is a lot here in Four Brothers that will match with Doestoyevski's novel, but the subtlety and incorporated action and suspense makes this, IMHO, Singleton's best film yet.",Four Brothers
220,runesb,john singleton in the woods,4,26 December 2005,"very hard to believe this movie was done by the same guy who gave us boyz in the hood and this movie only supports the opinion he should have stopped then. It is extremely genre-confused. It is at the same time tooth-achingly sentimental and, supposedly, a spot on socio-portrayal of a Detroit community. It is Eminem goes to Disney (and this movie would hardly had been done if it wasn't for him). Four brothers, two white and two black, have their saintly all-too-goody foster mom killed by gangsters. After they discover that she was indeed targeted by these gangsters (i was never convinced why) they set out to set things straight - their way. well, actually they stumble through comedy, action and socio-drama in a plot that is way too orchestrated.John Singleton must be in dire need of a hit; he tried too hard but felt too little in this film.",Four Brothers

My father recommended me this movie way back when I was just 15, way before I started creating in the revenge line of books but I didn't see it until recently. I'm glad I did too. There is no wasted time in this film The meat of the film are as the title suggests the four brothers, who take an average movie concept and elevate it into something that hits way close to heart. Even the characters that don't get a lot of screen time, especially Evelyn Mercer whom I felt sad for, which I'll fully admit.The relationship between the brothers feels realistic. As someone who is an older sibling by blood and became 'older brother' to some of my friends I can relate. This is a character driven film no doubt.The action is simple yet effective, nothing too flashy or too simplefied. The look and soundtrack of the movie also scratched an itch I didn't know I had.Will watch again, this is simply too enjoyable if you like these kinds of movies.",Four Brothers
222,gramps_w,I thought it was a decent flick,7,25 January 2006,"I really liked the cast, and thought they did excellent work.I thought Wahlberg and Gibson were especially noteworthy with the right mix anger. Sofía Vergara is hilarious, and she and Gibson had a great chemistry together.Benjamin, Hedlund, and Howard created believable characters, but I thought Wahlberg and Gibson carried the film.The story itself is what keeps me from rating the film any higher. It's pretty good, but is really just a remake of John Wayne's ""The Sons of Katie Elder"". The only changes were minor tweaks and updating to modern day Detroit, but there really is no significant difference between the two stories. Maybe I should call that a ""spoiler"", 'cause if you've seen the John Wayne flick, you know how this comes out.In society, I don't think anyone really wants people going around taking their own revenge, dispensing their own justice, or using torture and violence to extract information from a suspect, but it does make good cinema!",Four Brothers

I don't believe it is worthy of the average rating it received here. Its the first time a movie with that high an IMDb rating has not been worth watching.It seemed like a B+ grade TV movie, not a real movie. Some OK acting. One OK action scene. But all pretty average all up.Drawn out. A few good bits, but not worth the time as there was too much slow, boring parts in between.I would not recommend it to anyone. It had no redeeming features worth spending the time needed to fully watch it.I say go watch something else - whilst this is watchable, its certainly nothing special.",Four Brothers
224,josh_ball13,The Mean Streets of Michigan,7,7 February 2006,"This is one of those movies where most people, when they see the movie poster in the hallway to their local multiplex, will mostly skip over and either not decide to see it or decide they'll tell one of their friends to go see it first and tell them how it was. In all honesty, this was my attitude when I first saw the previews.The basis of the plot line is that the adoptive mother of four hopelessly lost degenerates (Fionnula Flanagan) is brutally murdered and these four brothers all return to their familiar (and violent) streets to bury their beloved mother and to discover the one behind the murder. Moving hastily from one retrieved clue to another, Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg), Angel Mercer (Tyrese Gibson), Jerry Mercer (Andre 3000), and Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund) use one another's strong points to uncover a vast and disturbing political cover-up that leads deep into the dirty underbelly of their home town only to lead to an almost perfectly executed ending that will probably leave you wondering where and how such a story could be pulled together with little to no flaws in it.Although this story is no Academy Award winner or nominee for that matter, it definitely has its strong points. Quite the number of entertaining interaction of ""brotherly love"" between the four brothers is the highlight of the movie in between shoot-outs and chase scenes with the baddies of the films. And the unnerving portrayal of the villain, Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofer) has a ring of familiarity to it as Denzel's bad guy from Training Day.All in all a satisfying movie with funny lines (espically with delivered by Mark Wahlberg's tough Detroit street accent), great action scenes, and an ending happy enough to make your heart melt the sixteen inches of snow in the film, Four Brothers is definitely worth checking out if not worth adding to your DVD collection.",Four Brothers

You would expect all those from ""Four Brothers"" in a ""revenge film"". What I didn't expect to experience, was the depth of emotion they evoked in me. They were beyond believable characters. I have met brothers like them, who treat each other in ways portrayed on screen.Even though ""Momma"" is killed early in the film, she is a very strong character who's presence is commanding. ""Entering Momma's House"", ""Unpacking in Momma's House"", ""Thanksgiving Dinner"", and the closing scene are all about the deep love and respect these four men have for their recently departed mother.I think men will enjoy this movie.",Four Brothers
226,bratgirli,Overrated,1,22 August 2005,"Although I put a 1 rating, I thought this movie was okay but not better than that. It needs to be brought down a few notches because it's not a great movie. The Latin woman in this movie needs acting classes and the character in general was an insult to women. There were instances where this movie had a Quentin Tarrantino flavor but it didn't work. The chase scene was a joke. It was so unreal that it was almost comical. If John Singleton wanted to make that kind of movie, he should have asked QT for help. There were some good elements to this movie, like the cops. Their storyline and outcome of it was unexpected and great. Too much unrealism mixed in with a potential realistic subject. The ""mothers"" character was also disappointing. See the movie, buy the DVD but if you go in with high expectations, expect to be disappointed.",Four Brothers

Acting from the brothers is first rate, as is the fabulous Terrence Howard. However, the script is pretty weak, although the interplay between the four main actors is really charming and the shoot out is really well filmed. I found the Western elements to be really cheesy. When Bobby comes at the end to fight Sweet, filmed from the distance, it just seems funny, almost a parody of a bad western. And what about Jack. Although Bobby clearly was devastated at his death, there is little of no mention of him later on in the movie. No one else seems to mourn him. By the way, I thought Garrett Hedlund was excellent in this movie and it is a travesty that he was not nominated at the MTV awards.",Four Brothers

I can't stand it when I watch a film, get really attached to a character (Garrett Hedlund as Jack Mercer) and then they just die. I was intending to give the film a 10 without question but I just had to deduct a point because of Garret Hedlund's and Terrence Howard's shock executions.

Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund add that much more to the movie. The story isn't at all far-fetched either. There are two gunmen, and they run into a little mom and pop grocery store, ambush the cashier, murder him, and then they kill these four guys' mother, and the four want to know who. So they go looking for vengeance. It is definitely something I would do if my mother was murdered in cold blood the way that the guys' mother was killed.

I figured I could get lots of flip over time with all the commercials on TNT. Unfortunately TNT was showing this with minimal commercials (TNT with minimal commercials???).I thought at first that this was going to be a bad Big Chill theme twist with friends/family returning to the scene of their youth over the death of a loved one and period music playing in the background.

The story line was forced and very predictable. Oh yeah apparently gun laws don't apply in Detroit, so it's OK to walk around Detroit wielding your gun into a high school gym and not have any repercussions. Markie Mark was wasn't at his best I'll leave it at that. Although Andre 3000 was the only highlight of the movie, I was impressed that he could act and he was the only one that held this movie afloat. The filming wasn't well done at all.

237,sbd1970,Car Chase,8,21 June 2008,"One of the best car chases!! In a snowstorm, on slick roads yet very intense and realistic. It was a very gritty movie showing the harshness of Detroit's inner city. Having Evan eat of the floor was humiliating enough but then having Evan's wife eat right beside him was very humiliating and showed the sadistic streak of Victor. Setting the movie in the winter must have been hard for all the actors and crew because most of the scenes are outside and you could tell it was cold. The only character that had the moral high ground in the whole movie was Evelyn Mercer and she dies in the first few minutes.

The shoot-out was just unbelievable. ""Someone call 911!"" at the end? If people out front of MY house were using automatic weapons, I don't think we would need to call 911 at the end of it. On top of all this, acting? Stunk. Script? Stunk more. The ""plot"" ""turns"" were like driving down a straight road. You could see what was coming from a mile away. Besides special effects and car chases, I think a 4th grader could have written a more compelling script, and certainly got his/her friends to act better than various characters in this heap.

Rather, a view on life through the perspective of ordinary men whom through such extreme circumstances, must become as ruthless and ''hot-headed'' as some of the criminals portrayed in this film, consequently implementing their own brand of justice.I came across this film through a recommendation from a friend while in 11th Grade, and 3 years onward this is (and will always remain without doubt) my favourite film. I will not say more, and some may find this comment irrelevant once they see the movie (depicting one's taste which should be respected) but through effective blends of genre (prominently action and drama, with a warming sense of comedy and brotherly love) we see how life brings together four brothers whom have nothing but love for each other in common, hence showing us all the value of family and how unpredictable life is.10/10",Four Brothers
241,craigtrnbll,"Terrible, clichéd tripe.",1,13 January 2010,"I have just finished watching Four Brothers on the strength of reviews submitted on this site, which turned out to be a big mistake. The main protagonists, the four brothers of the title, are played with varying degrees of ineptitude by a cast of incompetents and failed musicians. Well one failed musician, Marky Mark, and the inexplicably popular, yet dire, André Benjamin. (Roses really smell like poo. Such wit). The names of said incompetents elude me and I lack the will necessary for the quick peruse of the internet research demands, so I had better get on with the review proper. The film. Oh my God the film. The film is so dull even writing this review is making me yawn like a Homer in church, so hear is quick list of my problems with the picture. The ""plot"" revolves around four adopted brothers' attempts to discover the killer or killers of their adoptive mother. Of course this being a gritty ""street"" drama the brothers are predictably a mixed race bunch. ""Nothing wrong with that,"" I hear you cry and in reality you would be right but in this film, it just screams of cliché. At, or very near the beginning of the film, two policemen discuss the brothers, saying they would be pure evil if it hadn't been for their mother. I feel the director/writer was attempting to put in place some moral reasoning for the ensuing violence, in an obviously transparent manner. If the viewer has no objections to being patronized to, then all well and good, but I do. Following hot on the heels of this awful scene the four ""brothers"" (yes the quotation marks are deliberate), are to be found sitting at a dinner table, staring into space and one at a time, seeing their mother talk to them. A procession of clichéd memories and speeches from the mother had me reaching for, not the sick bag as many would assume, but a tissue to wipe my eyes as I was laughing so hard. Utterly ridiculous.The rest of the movie consists of the usual car chases, beatings, hackneyed gangsters and moralized murder one would expect from such a turgid and utterly appalling outing and I hope to never see it again. I frankly can't be bothered to write a more detailed analysis of the remainder as I fear further thought of the film would cause my brain would melt from my eyes.

OK, I was just 8 years old, I didn't know anything about movies (not that I know something now).But I saw this movie last Saturday evening, alone in my parents bedroom while they were cooking and watching TV and I actually liked it. I mean, sure, I was a bit scared during the whole movie and I even yelled when Evelyn got shot but I still liked it. It woke ""something"" up inside of me. First I loved Mark Wahlberg's acting, I always had him as a very funny guy and now even more. André was OK but Tyrese was the ladies man/loser we all know and love because he always gets the crazy chick and everyone else knows that she is mental except of, obviously, him. I loved Garrett Hedlund (<3), mainly because he is the youngest, most innocent and (for me) the cutest. But I also loved his acting, because he was funny and the sad scenes were real.

It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting, writing and direction is tremendous. Low budget doesn't show - it's beautifully shot.

I thought I was going into a simple plot revenge film using the classic design but much like a lot of revenge flicks lately(Kill Bill as one) this one had a lot more plot and surprisingly good performances. The soundtrack was classic Motown to go along the Detroit backdrop and at the same time giving the feel of the classic Soul Cinema that inspired Singleton. Though some of the lead characters are white, the fact that the family is a mixed family in predominantly black Detroit is like Singleton's message about the changing times. The movie is pretty violently and there isn't many positive female roles in the film except for the little we learn about the mother through her ""appearances"". If we had a little more exposure to her in the beginning of the film, maybe showing her with younger versions of her sons, it'd make the audience care that much more. But that's nit-picking, the film will satisfy anyone who wants a good revenge film with a decent plot. All the performances are strong and Andre Benjamin does well in his first big role.

Great acting jobs by Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson and Garrett Hedlund as three of the four brothers. Sofia Vergara provides lovely visuals. The Motor City looks as gritty as it ought to be.

249,mattwadleigh,An action film that easily trumps this years releases...,9,14 August 2005,"This summer has featured a lack of movies with any redeemable qualities, so I half-expected the mid-August release of ""Four Brothers"" to be terrible, even though the trailer to the film made it look like an incredible action movie with, get this, actual character development to go along with gripping action scenes. Thankfully, I was very wrong in this assumption as Four Brothers turned out to be easily the best action movie of the year and possibly one of the better movies of the year that I've been subjected to.Set in Detroit, Four Brothers puts the camera on four adopted brothers who have come home to find that their saintly elderly mother has been slain in a robbery-gone-wrong. After doing a little dirt digging, however; they find that their mothers' death was no random act and that some old-fashioned revenge killing is in order.Since the movie is set in Detroit, we can naturally assume that most crimes go unaddressed, which reminds us to forgive the film for allowing our heroes to go around brandishing weapons in public and threatening people. Surprisingly though, this is the only major leap in our judgment that we're forced to make as the rest of the film does a good job of preventing any plot holes that would take away from it. This rock-solid plot is coupled with strong acting performances from the entire cast and some very intense action, including an excellent chase scene and an awesome firefight.In the end, Four Brothers looks at this summers release of movies, the Deuce Bigalows, the Dukes of Hazzards, the Stealths, and it tells them that they suck, that they shouldn't have been released, and then it shoots them.

I am at a complete loss after reading the ""external reviews"" and can only conclude that there are 2 movies with the same title being released in different parts of the country.I predict that word of mouth will end this movie's box office life in reasonably quick order. However, I'm sure it will outdraw ""The Great Raid"" which is an entertaining quasi-historically correct movie that leaves the viewer satisfied.The only upside to Four Brothers is that it made me appreciate Joe Dirt and 3000 miles to Graceland.

Also, the way the actors plays their parts... We already knew that Mark Whalberg is a great actor, but together with the rest of the cast, it is made so obvious yet again.

He really managed to capture both the strength and ""badness"" of Jack, but still keep the vulnerable part. And when taking the fact that this is only his third movie..

Mark Wahlberg does not disappoint fans, by keeping his usual ""bad boy"" image, however, he does give his character depth and history which makes his acting brilliant and noteworthy. The other three actors are superb as well. I believe one of them is Andre' 3000 a singer, making his debut movie performance, did a great job. The movie is well directed and cast and the characters in it come to life on the screen...what more can you ask for?",Four Brothers
255,sweetmik,"Awesome movie, did expect it to be as good as it was.",10,22 July 2005,"Went to see a preview of it two nights ago, and was presently surprised with it. Very good movie. Despite the fact that it's about four brothers avenging their mothers death, there is a lot of humor in it. The brothers give each other sh*t all the time, but you can tell they love each other. Mark Whalberg (sp?) did a good job, but i think my favorite character was Jackie, played by Garrett Hedlund. There was a lot of action, a lot of violence, very graphic, but it was well done and believable. Not exactly a movie for children, but it's a family movie. All in all, it's very funny and uplifting (towards the end), but very sad.",Four Brothers
256,texpatlee,Great modern twist on a classic,8,5 June 2013,"This is a great modern twist on the John Wayne and Dean Martin classic - ""The Sons of Katie Elder."" Loved Mark Wahlberg's update of John Wayne's character, Outcast's Andre 3000 is great with his take on Dean Martin's character, and Garret Hedlund's take on Michael Anderson Jr's original is simply masterful. The teasing of Jack Mercer is a dead ringer to that of Bud Elder. The direction is outstanding and it is almost exactly identical of Henry Hathaway's where he just let the actors ""do what they do"" and the dialogue will just developed naturally. I absolutely recommend seeing this movie as well as ""The Sons of Katie Elder.""",Four Brothers
257,skatrgyrll91,i laughed ...i cried ...i loved it,10,29 August 2005,I went to see this movie yesterday and it was better than I expect it to be. Mark Wahlberg(Bobby Mercer) is a great actor and he plays his character well. I thought all the actors were great but my favorite was Garrett Hedlund(Jack Mercer). He's so innocent and young. I think he was probably abused when he was little. I cried when he got killed. It was one of the saddest scenes. He was so hot...hotter than Mark Wahlberg. Tyrese(Angel Mercer) is perfect for the role of Angel and Andre (3000)Benjamin(Jeremiah Mercer) is the responsible one so he plays his character well. The chase scene is one of the intense scene i have ever saw. The soundtrack fits in with the movie. The Motown music fits perfectly with the Detroit setting. I can't wait to buy the DVD. I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone under 14. It has a lot of violence and strong language but not that much sexual content. But it had a lot of funny scenes. I can't wait to see this movie again. I loved it!!!!!,Four Brothers

It's about revenge after all...It is at times predictable, but none-the-less a fine piece of action drama, stylish, with some good old fashioned themes, about loyalty, revenge, humour, love, respect. The four lead characters could have done with a bit of background, I would have loved to have seen how their 'Mom' gathered them together, worked her magic.Think the soundtrack and some solid performances make this action film worth every penny.I enjoyed it.",Four Brothers
260,edd_c-1,The most flawed film I have ever seen - Avoid!!,2,1 October 2005,"I should have taken a notebook to the cinema to write down all the plot holes, continuity issues and just general mistakes I witnessed when I saw this film in the opening night. Luckily I had a free ticket to the cinema because if I had paid to sit through this film I would have demanded my money back. I don't want to add to many spoilers in case you actually decide to watch this waste-of-your-life ""film"", but please, do yourself a favour and don't see it! If you do, count the number of errors and post here, we can see if we manage to cover them all. OK, so let me try and remember some of the issues from the film. Firstly, the ""brothers"" haven't been in the neighbourhood for some time - one of them comments that the house is exactly as they left it, so why were there new iMacs in the background - surely these wouldn't have existed when they lived there. In addition, the lady who was killed at the beginning had lots of children staying over, so I am sure she would have changed the rooms and details about the house would have changed since the brothers moved out. Out of the many shootings that took place, it seems that no one actually witnessed any of them in the whole neighbourhood - bizarre. When they go to find the guy in the tower block, the two brothers run up the stairs and tell the third to watch the elevator and tell them where it stops. As soon as it reaches the fifth floor, it seemingly takes the third brother about five seconds to sprint up the five floors that took the other two brothers about 2 minutes to go up! What else, oh yeah they are having that ""family dinner"" at night time and suddenly Marky Mark announces it's time to play hockey - which appears to happen in the day time. Simple continuity! OK let's move to the scene on the ice - the cars seem to be driving for minutes at top speeds to reach the hole in the ice. Remember that the brother who is going to pay off the gangster doesn't know where they are going. And suddenly, who comes walking over the ice but Marky Mark - that's one hell of a long walk! There were some more continuity issues that were a little harder to notice. In the original shooting scene, the robber loads up his pockets with money then shoots the guy behind the counter, then hears the lady and shoots her, but when the brothers watch the ""cctv"" tape, you can see the robber shoot the guy behind the till then load his pockets. Embarrassing from start to finish - how people are rating this above a 3 on here I will never know, I thought that people made justified comments on this site before!",Four Brothers
261,caitlin_clendenin,Four Times the Revenge,8,27 September 2013,"John Singleton's ""Four Brothers"" (2005) takes place in Detroit, Michigan. The first scene starts out with an elderly, good natured woman lecturing a young man about stealing candy from the local convenience store. As soon as the boy leaves two robbers enter the store and proceed to shoot Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) dead. Shortly after the killing her four sons: Bobby (Mark Walhberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) return for her funeral. After reviewing the footage of the shooting the boys begin to investigate further. The police blatantly tell the brothers to stay out of the investigation. After they interrogate the only witness to the crime, Damien (Lyriq Bent), they begin to realize that this was no ordinary robbery. A hit was ordered on their foster mother for asking questions about her son Jeremiah's latest business deal. Now they come to the conclusion that the police may know more than they are letting on. They decide to take whatever actions are necessary to see that justice is served.""Four Brothers"" seems to be centered on revenge, with some underlying western morals. The director shows that in some people's eyes revenge is sometimes justifiable. The world is not always black and white; there are gray areas in between. It also showcases the extent of unsolved crimes in Detroit. The characters in the film are out for revenge because a good, kind hearted woman for whom they cared is murdered. The director shows that some people will go to any length to see that justice is served how they see fit.I found this film appealing because the story is about vigilante justice. The subject of vigilante justice is attractive to me because I constantly read about unsolved crimes in the news. Bad things happen to good people all the time and nothing is done about it. In the movie the police appear to be uninterested in catching Evelyn Mercer's killers. I feel like often the police feel that matters are not as serious as the victim feels they are. By the end of ""Four Brothers"" the bad guys got their just desserts.",Four Brothers
262,davidswindle,"""Revenge leaves plot out in the cold""",6,16 August 2005,"I would just like to say that in the last couple years, I have not been the type of person to hang out at the local movie theater and go see every movie that comes out. Anymore..I really have to be truly interested in seeing the movie. It has to be an original story, the only time it does not matter, would be like if its a comedy..sometimes you just need a good laugh even if the movies sucks. ""Four Brothers"" was the first movie I have seen in the theaters since I saw the sci-fi epic re-make of ""War of the Worlds""; and lets just say I was crossing my fingers for a good ""ghetto murder/mystery"". Now I knew going into the theater, what I was getting into..I mean you have a coming home to the old neighborhood story from ""Boyz n the Hood"" director; John Singleton, thrown in with leading ""brother""; a former bad boy himself, Mark Wahlberg. The film started out decent enough, the story of four foster brothers who return home to Detroit to the crime-ridden and poverty-stricken streets of their youth, to bury their foster-mother who was just recently killed in a supposed liquor store robbery.""Revenge"" and ""an eye for an eye"" turned into the themes; instead of a more elaborate plot of maybe their mother having uncovered something or witnessed something she shouldn't have..instead the reason behind her murder was the fact that she had been making a public fuss about one of her sons losing his public assistance for his business..their mother had found out that because her son would not pay protection to the local crime boss..who owned the politicians and half the police, this gangster was causing her son to lose his business. Possibly a bit predictably, I think the story would have flowed better, had there been more of a mystery behind why their mother was killed, even something as cheesy as she found out that a local cop or politician was using a public building, like a community center to store guns or drugs..and local kids were being used as mules or something sinister. Something that the director did that I definitely liked was the way he had the spirit of their mother talk to them all individually at several points in the film. I think the directory did this instead of the typical flashback sequence..that you see in most films. I admit in most movies.the flashback sequences are usually too long or unclear and many times too frequent. But not to come off sounding contradictive of my own belief, I think at least one or two flashbacks could have worked. I wish we would could have at least one scene when the boys were youngerto know where they came from..or maybe what they went thru..before they found their adoptive mom. The director attempted to make the one brother ""Jack"" played by Garrett Hedlund(Troy, Firday Night Lights), gain the sympathy of the audience, by constantly having the other brothers; tease him for being the youngest and refer to him as a queer, and a weakling. I think the director did this in hopes that when he got killed the audience would mourn his passing. I think if we had a bit more background on ""Jack"", and all the other brothers for that matter than maybe the audience would have felt their pain and loss more easily.All together the movie was a decent flick, a very entertaining show. I got my monies worth I would say. Its not surprising that it was number one at the box office this weekend, I mean it did not have much competition.""Four Brothers"" was an all-together good show, and I recommend it, but save your money on a cinema ticketit can wait till video.movie extras: 1-""sexy lady in cold Detroit"" Keep an eye out for the hot latina super model Sofia Vergara, she has a small part as Tyrese Gibson's girlfriend. You may not recognize her at first because she is sporting dark roots to portray a Puertorican, apposed to her normal blonde locks; but her beautiful Columbian body that never stops, is recognizable instantly.2-""good guy & bad guys"" Actor Josh Charles who typically played quite good guys in films such as: ""Dead Poets Society"", ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"", and ""Threesome"", has found a knack lately playing double-crossers and crooked cops; first in ""S.W.A.T."" and now again in ""Four Brothers"".",Four Brothers

Mark Wahlberg, Garrett Hedlund, Andre Benjamin and Tyrese Gibson are flawless playing the adopted Mercer brothers in this movie, they play off each other like they're real brothers; it's amazing to watch. Although Benjamin is cautious about joining his brothers in their ""quest"" for justice, another tragedy brings them all together again. The acting is incredibly real and raw, making it hard to believe that these characters are not who the actors actually are in real life. I deducted one point for the endearing, but kind of creepy chats the brothers have with their dead mother... It didn't really fit into the rest of the movie.",Four Brothers

They used a lot of old Motown songs. It was action packed and funny. The audience was really into it. They were cheering and clapping. We were pretty much sitting on the edge of our seats.

This piece of crap had so many holes in it, I spent a half an hour after seeing it with my son, listing all of the flaws. The main thing the film tells us is that it is OK to kill anyone who you think did you wrong, and it justifies this premise by the fact that the police are corrupt. Come on!!! It's amazing that the city of Detroit didn't protest this smear on its name. Having lived there for a year, this portrayal is totally unfair and stereotypical. That dinner table scene was so maudlin that it could have been done by a first year film student, and the mother character was so bad she was scary.

I'm nineteen so this movie was aimed at my age group but it should have been aimed at twelve year olds. I enjoy outkast musically and I believe Andre Benjamin had the strongest performance and most developed character. The other three were just hotheads. Wow, never seen that before. The character Jack, the ""rocker"", so to speak was really cliché. The fight scene at the end where it shows Mark Whalberg walking up to the villain and the group of guys, where was he walking from.

272,great_gord_on,"Awful, just plain awful",1,11 January 2006,"I cannot for the life of me understand the two thumbs up from Ebert and Roeper. The plot is filled with clichés, the dialog is forced and poorly written, and the acting is downright shameful. I'm having trouble deciding whether Mark Wahlberg is worse at acting or rapping. Sadly, I think John Singleton had one movie in him.It's a good thing that Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) commented on the poor police work in Detroit in the beginning of the movie. Fortunately, that explains a lot of the awful tangents from reality that this movie takes. How does one go to an inner city basketball game, interrupt the action, wave a pistol around, and then have time to calmly question an innocent kid in the hallway right afterward? Well, the police in Detroit are lousy. Oh yeah.. he said that in the beginning. That explains it. How does a Wild West shootout happen in front of your house, leaving dead bodies strewn all over the street, and you and your brothers sit calmly on your stoop while the police tsk-tsk you for taking matters into your own hands? Oh yeah.. that crappy police thing. That one line sure goes a long way in this movie.The clichés are all over the place in this plot. The two-bit hustler turned crime boss, the dirty city councilman who appears to be trying to clean up the neighborhood while he's secretly in cahoots with said crime boss, the dirty cop killing his partner, the One Good Cop who really seems to care, the plot twist that leads them to wrongly suspect one of the brothers, the weakest brother dying because he was a little too spunky, the boxing match to settle all scores, et cetera ad nauseum. Why at the end of the movie are these two guys (who supposedly hate each other with a passion) exhibiting such fine boxing form, throwing jabs and bobbing and weaving? The acting in this movie is just plain terrible. The best example is the Bobby Mercer line, as their running from the bodega to look for the guy with an afro (who turns out to not have such a big afro afterall - curious.. maybe he got a haircut and Singleton didn't notice). He says something like, ""that wasn't a holdup, it was a contract killing. Let's go!"" They all take off at a brisk jog. Now.. obviously Singleton believes that a lot of stupid people are going to watch this film so that he needs his characters to ham-handedly spell out the plot twists. But why are they running? And why does Mark Wahlberg have to deliver each line like he's reading a comic book? Honestly, that line should have been followed by the horn section doing the Batman theme (Na na na na na na na na...) One brother has a Boston accent (Mark Wahlberg), one sounds like he's from New York (Garret Hedlund), one gravel-voices his way through every line like Wolverine in X-Men (Tyrese Gibson), and worst of all Andre (3000) Benjamin does nothing to mask his durrty south accent. If Singleton was going to go out of his way to make Detroit a part of the movie, the least he could do is lead us to believe that the characters might actually be from Detroit.I also found it amusing (not in a good way) when Angel (Tyrese Gibson) calls Jeremiah ""white boy"" in a derogatory tone. I guess Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) who was standing right next to him was white in a manner that was acceptable at that moment. Curious.It took great effort to actually finish watching this movie, and in the end I was sorry that I did. As if the cliché-ridden plot weren't enough to doom this movie, the acting and directing drag it even lower. Was this film somehow affiliated with Disney? That's the only reason I can fathom for the ""thumbs up"" from E&R.Honestly.. don't waste your time. This movie stays just as bad throughout as it is in the beginning.",Four Brothers

The storyline is original and engaging. And the teaming of four exceptional actors is evident with their comedic and dramatic skills.

275,Tessa19,Four adopted brothers return home to grieve after their mother is killed,7,4 September 2005,"This movie may not be an academy award winner, but it is worth seeing. Four Brothers is surprisingly heartwarming and not so surprisingly action-packed, the movie holds your attention in a way that a lot of other movies can't, and you find yourself truly invested in each brothers story. Although the plot is somewhat hazy at times, I still can't really recall why the hit was taken out on the mother, Singleton's use of different camera shots was cool and the action while somewhat unrestrained was also believable and attention grabbing. However what really stood out in this movie was the acting and chemistry between the four adopted brothers. Mark Walhberg's portrayal of Bobby Mercer, the eldest brother and leader of the group, is solid and he seemed a lot more comfortable in this role, like in I heart Huckabees, than in some of his earlier roles (i.e. fear). Andre Benjamin as the second oldest and family man, Jerry, was understated but affective all the same.Tyrese Gibson's performance is also great, Angel is the soldier boy returned home not only to grieve but also to rekindle an old spark and return to his slightly criminal-ish ways, and finally Jack, the youngest brother, B-class rock-star and frequent punchline of his brothers jokes, Garret Hedlund is really great in this role and is probably the most interesting emotionally to watch, as his character seems to have had the hardest childhood before being adopted. The family dynamic is amazing and is the reason this movie works, it never once in the course of this movie seem unrealistic or unnatural that these four are brothers, and the genuine affection, trust, and love that they have for one another is unquestionably and sometimes painfully realistic. This is a great all-round movie.",Four Brothers

It has much action and substance as the brothers led by Bobby Murcer (played well by Mark Wahlberg) go throughout many places looking for clues and witnesses which lead them through adventurous shootouts and many interesting characters.

It's the kind of movie you wander into the theater to see after you had a fight with your best friend. Or a movie you take a date to see. It's not exactly heavy, thought-provoking stuff. Mostly it's tough guy machismo hyped to the umpteenth degree and complete with a snowy, blown-tire, skidding car chase. But I liked it.First, the chemistry between the ""brothers"" was touching. Tyrese's character was distracted throughout most of the movie, but the other three were so into their roles, you wanted to believe in their plight. You wanted to see justice done for the heartless murder of their caring adopted mother. You held your breath through certain parts, fists clenched, butt numb from teetering on the edge of your SEAT! Second, the eye-candy factor was through the roof. As a female, it didn't hurt to watch some aesthetically-pleasing boys swooping through the ghettos of Detroit with guns bigger than hell. I'll admit it was mental junk-food. Nothing profound or ""new"" came from this movie.

282,ryro4,Rather disappointing.,5,17 September 2005,"Their are numerous problems to this movie, which I was dragged to just because Walhberg was in it, that make this film just a waste of money in my opinion.First off, if you have wasted time playing the GTA game series, you have no need to watch this movie, the scripts are shockingly similar. Characters matched up, lines matched up, the ever popular drive-by's, and corruption all lined up. Secondly, the story, while having many twists and turns, left a lot of plot-holes. Many times I found myself confused by their(the 4 brothers) logic because their was basically no logic to it; how they handled different situations, how they handled receiving information, all of it never made any sense to me. Third, I couldn't help but think every character in the movie was an idiot. I would sometimes mutter ""moron"" or ""idiot"" and I feel that everyone around me agreed. And just to add, the sense of ruthlessness portrayed by every character(except for the ones that die?) makes me pity how violent our society is.On a lighter side, the movie did have a lot of twists that did keep me wondering the whole time, but it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat because everyone is able to predict exactly what happens about a minute before it happens. Their were the occasional fights that I found entertaining and kept me awake and who doesn't love a good ole gun fight.To wrap this up, i would say the movie was overly violent, plagiarized, and discriminating(wow, now i wonder, where do stereotypes come from?), but it did have a small bit of humor here and their, and the plot turns and ideas played out by different characters did make it interesting. Overall, I wouldn't suggest it.",Four Brothers

I found both CHIWETEL and CHJWETEL all over the place, but no ""official"" actor's web page. I've chosen to use CHJWETEL in this review... i guess because I think it's cooler. No disrespect is intended. At least, not in the spelling (or misspelling, as the case may be) of his name.*** Well... I wanted to like it more than I did. Every time I was just getting into its groove... Victor would show up. Huh? Who is this actor and why is he on my screen? Who would be afraid of this goof-ball? I can't remember the last time I felt an actor was so over his head in a role. The floor-eating scene... am I the only only one who said to myself, ""If I were in that room, I would have made him wipe up that mess he made on the floor, washed his potty-mouth with soap, then spanked his little butt for being too big for its britches and sent him to his room!"" Victor Sweet is supposed to be this incredibly powerful Detroit underworld commander... an Overlord of Evil, even. I like the role, and I love the fact that casting selected a relatively unknown actor. I just think it was the wrong actor. He came across... immature.He fell so flat; there was no sincerity, nothing real behind it. Just some goofy guy that the baddies were following because he reminded them mildly of Laurence Fishburne.I kept picturing the filming of the his scenes going something like this: John Singleton: OK. CUT.JS runs hands thru hair and sighs: OK, CHJWETEL, THAT WAS GOOD, LET'S DO IT AGAIN. BUT THIS TIME, CAN I GET YOU TO DO A LITTLE MORE... UM... SOMETHING?

WHAT KIND OF PERSONALITY DO YOU THINK HE HAS? CE: HE'S ENIGMATIC. I'M BEING ENIGMATIC.JS: YES, CHJWETEL. HE IS Definitely ENIGMATIC. BUT UNDERNEATH THAT, HE'S A REALLY BAD GUY. REALLY BAD. VICIOUS. EVERYBODY IS SCARED OF HIM BECAUSE THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT. HE'S BOILING OIL UNDERNEATH THAT COOL EXTERIOR.CE: HE'S ENIGMATIC.JS: YES, BUT BOILING OIL UNDERNEATH.CE: I'M BEING ENIGMATIC.(JS LOOKS AT CHJWETEL)CE, STARING BLANKLY: ENIGMATIC JS STARES CE, STILL STARING BLANKLY JS, MUTTERING AND WALKING AWAY: OH, DEAR GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?CE, CALLING AFTER HIM: ENIGMATIC?!??

284,djnova85,There are other ways to spend a Friday or Saturday night.,2,13 August 2005,"In my opinion, the biggest problem with 4 Bros, is that it's not believable. There is no real sense of relationship between the four main characters; the Thanksgiving dinner scene is very awkward, and much of the time you see four actors saying lines instead of a family interacting. Overall, the acting is not good except for Wahlberg; although they all had their moments here and there. None of them was believable in the emotional scenes despite the fact that they were able to bring tears; it almost always seemed forced. Tyrese's Latina girlfriend displays just about every imaginable stereotype associated with her background; I would have expected better from someone that grew up in Los Angeles (Singleton). Her character seems to exist only to have a hot chick. As far as I could tell, she had no affect whatsoever on the outcome of the situation. You know it's a bad sign when you're watching a movie and don't care how it ends; in fact, I didn't stick around to find out. I saw 90% of it, I just decided I wanted something to eat more than I wanted to find out the exact way the movie arrives at its very predictable conclusion. If the it doesn't end with Wahlberg beating the absolute crap out of the Victor Sweet guy while delivering the occasional witty remark, somebody let me know. Seriously, don't see this movie, even for free (like I did). There are so many other movies out there, although most of them are not in the theaters. Only watch this on an airplane; don't even rent it.",Four Brothers

This movie got into my emotions, made me laugh, made me cry (although I held back tears because I was with my brother), made me angry...I JUST LOVED IT! They made excellent choices for the cast, and I was just really happy with my experience when I went to see this movie.This was my first time seeing Garrett H. act, and I loved his performance.

I am not one for an emotional tale but this was a good one. a ride of guessing and misleads that will hold you to the end. Going to see it again tomorrow I loved it. hope you do to. just keep this thought through out the movie, ""this is real"" stories put together yes but I am sure someone out there has lived it. the portrayal was fantastic scenery and the lengths they took into building the mood with background and all worked so well for the characters. The characters were explained perfectly with a couple discussions but thats just makes it a better movie. Questioning society, law, and love, common themes but brought to life by them all just so fantastically.

Yes there was lots of action, more then I expected but the thing that really made me love this movie was the story. It was truly moving and I'm not afraid to admit that I cried at times. Unlike some action movies that think you can't have a story this one uses the drama and emotions to support the violence. So even though it is violent(and it IS VIOLENT) its not out of context. So this movie has it all,lots of action and drama. Over all I loved this movie. In fact I'm going to see it again because sometimes a movie can be good enough that you wont get tired of seeing it at the theater. This is definitely one of those movies.",Four Brothers

I cannot wait for the soundtrack to hit the stores.The only question that it left me with is: Where the heck did Bobby come from while he was walking on the ice to get Victor Sweet? That's a LOT of anger to fuel one across a frozen lake when everyone else drove Denali's.I always thought that Mark (AND Donny Wahlberg, for that matter) was sexy & now Andre 3000's voice makes me want to rob a bank.Seriously though...this was an excellent movie.",Four Brothers

I was, however, gratefully surprised that he wasn't playing his usual pretty-boy-tries-for-tough-guy role. More impressive was the fact that the plot line and dialogue were so believable. I could venture a guess that most people will not appreciate the graphic violence of this film but I can tell you that it is necessary to make the overall experience of the movie believable. There is nothing miraculous about this movie and no themes are terribly difficult to discern. If you were ever curious about the reaction children would have to the murder of a loved parent, you can pretty much see it played out in this film. Congrats to the studio, this one is a good watch!",Four Brothers
290,selene-garza,Spoiler -Four Brothers,5,16 August 2005,"The movie was enjoyable, that was actually very surprising since the previews seemed to give the entire movie away. Nonetheless, the cast that made up the four adopted brothers was very well put together and very appropriate for each role. I was happy to see that they weren't stereotypical roles, well not too stereotypical, at least compared to the characters on Singelton's 2 Fast 2 Furious...Well onto more criticisms: First off it was pretty obnoxious how throughout the entire movie they made a big deal about Andre 3000 being part of the Union back in the day -- and how nearly everyone he bumped into was part of the Union with him, it became lame. There were also a lot of scenes that didn't add up, such as how they seemed to come to speedy conclusions as to how and who killed their foster mother, and how did Mark Walhberg get to the middle of the lake without a vehicle in what looked to be below zero temperature?! In the end the brothers prevail, but lack the power of the fantastic foursome since one of them did get shot in a crazy shootout sequence that did move me to the edge of my seat with anticipation! So if you are out for one of the last summer's blockbuster filled with roll your eyes kinda' action and loads of thoughtless entertainment that will satisfy the macho in us all, then this movie is the one for you!

Mark Wahlberg is often underrated, and he gives a fabulous performance as the oldest brother, Bobby. Andre Benjamin was solid in his big film debut, and Tyrese did a surprisingly good job. However, the best by far goes to Garrett Hedlund, the almost-rocker who is constantly teased by his protective older brothers. The supporting cast were all fantastic as well.There is a lot of profanity and violence, but in reality, it is necessary for the situation. Although some parts may not be totally believable, you'll laugh and probably cry at the quick dialogue and surprising ""twists"".It is all complimented by a good soundtrack. I would recommend this movie to anybody (over the age of 14, however)",Four Brothers
292,taintedknowledge,One Of Marky Mark's Best,8,12 August 2005,"I was very unsure about this movie, I mean the actors consist of an old rapper (Mark Wahlberg)who hasn't done any good movies, a pretty good rapper (Andre 3000), who in my mind should stick to music, a singer (Tyrese) who has been placed in good movies, and still did a horrible job, and a new actor (Garret Hedlund) who I just found out played in Friday Night Lights and Troy. It has a nice plot, and shows different personalities of brothers this day and age. The screening that I went to see was not finished all the way, the screening guy said there will be some stuff removed and things added, usually after seeing a screening I usually wait until its out on DVD, and if it was a good screening I will buy the DVD, but in this case I will probably go see the movie more than once just because I will not be able to wait for it to come on DVD.

It was one of the worst movies I have recently seen and unlike other horrible movies it is NOT entertaining. I kept waiting for something cool to happen but it never did. Similar to just about every movie recently released. This movie is a sorry excuse to put four tough guys on screen and hope something good comes out of it.

Loved the brotherly banter between the lead actors and felt for them when one is murdered. Great action scenes, the car chase in the snow storm and the raid on the brothers home were the highlights. Good acting all around (although I thought the woman playing the mother had too many cheesy lines and moments). Andre Benjamin was showing pretty good potential as the brother who just wants to let things go but is also harboring a pretty important secret. Markie Mark was playing a more bad ass ex gangster version of....well Markie Mark.

I also liked the similarities and some of the differences that each of the brothers had, they were all endearing to me.I also enjoyed the passion showed by the characters for their mother and doing anything in their power to find who was responsible for their mother's killer. The camaraderie it wonderful.I also love the gritty look and feel of some of the different Detroit locales.I also like the transition Andre Benjamin's character, Jeremiah goes through.The lone walk that Mark Whalberg takes at the end with the long coat and crucifix to match, was one of the best shots to me...cliché or not.The frozen river just driving on it looked cool not to mention the other things that happened.Unfortunately the theater I went to, everyone spent so much time laughing uproariously at every joke I missed a bunch of dialogs but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.",Four Brothers

Mark Whalberg commands his character and will move you with (being careful not to give anything away) the things he says. You will hear members of the audience responding in kind to what Mark says at times. He has incredible talent and again demonstrates it under the direction of John Singleton. His fellow actors offer up HUGE support and perform equally as well. The plot is solid and takes you in many directions, pay attention and make certain you follow it.

Mark Whalberg and Tyrese Gibson play the perfect ""bad a**es"" while Andre and Garrett Hedlund counter as the skinny Irish and black characters. The key to the success of Four Brothers was the battle between the good and the bad, the brother's, green, and others in the hood, against Sweet and his gang. I definitely recommend you see the movie, no questions asked.",Four Brothers
300,Kooba89,Pleasantly Surprsing,8,1 August 2006,"To be honest, I have never been a die hard fan of action movies. Nothing against them, but they have just never really interested me, in so many action movies when there is a high speed car chase or a shoot out I just kind of get confused and go ""so who's shooting who."" So when at first I saw the commercials for the this movie I could not help but go, ""Damn, this looks pretty dumb"".My opinion was completely turned around just a few hours ago though, when I had nothing to do and decided to watch this movie (which was airing on one of the movie channels). Bracing myself for a stupid script and confusing shoot outs I started off with low expectations.Boy were my expectations wrong.Now this movie isn't the greatest movie in the world, but there is no doubt that it is good. I'm not sure how to describe this, but for me it seemed as if this was an action movie with substance - with a core. It wasn't just about revenge and killing off murderers, it was about four brothers who have such a strong bond - now that may sound cheesy, but you can ask anyone and it's true. This movie is an action movie no doubt, but at the centre of it is actually quite an emotional story.Throughout the movie though there is still a lot of action, good car chases, exciting shoot outs etc. Yet I seemed to enjoy them just because you really knew why there was so much fighting. Not in lots of dumb action films where there is just mindless shooting and killing.Besides that, I will say that the acting also pleasantly surprised me. Mark Wahlberg (who, no offense, I have never had too much respect for) really shocked me in this movie, he played his character really well. So well in fact that the character almost became real to me. Same with all the other brothers (Benjamin, Gibson and Hedlund), I really actually believed their characters. I think that that is when you know that it's a good movie - you truly believe that the characters are real people.So in the end, I will say that it is a good film and definitely worth a watch. It's got action scenes for the guys, and an emotional core for the rest of it.My two main complaints about this movie? 1. There were a lot of questions I thought up of during the movie which were never answered (for example, whenever Bobby or Angel are beating up people, Jack always get this really almost child like scared face on his expression. I would have really loved to know why he was so... afraid of hurting some people) 2. On occasion the characters seemed to be portrayed as being just as ruthless as their opponents, perhaps this was on purpose but after that I couldn't help but dislike the four brothers slightly.",Four Brothers

Great plot twists, and an interesting story all-together. It was so well acted that although you know the brothers aren't exactly upstanding citizens you find yourself rooting for them to really get to the bottom of what happened and get the true scum.

FINALLY- a movie worth our time and money!! 'Four Brothers' silenced their biggest critics ever- movie buffs. Ironically, 'Four Brothers' was our 'last resort movie'. We just wanted to get out of the house, but really had no interest in any of the movies playing. Thankfully we were highly mistaken. After a nearly two hour action filled film, I had laughed, I had cried, I sat at the edge of my seat and even screamed a few times. During the course of the film, movie watchers spoke out at the screen (without receiving any harsh 'shhh-ing'). The movie captivated and involved every soul in the audience. Everyday emotions were touched: pain, anger, revenge, confusion, love. The actors weren't actors; they were real people- everyday people. Our brothers, our sisters, our cousins, our mothers, our family- our truths. 'Four Brothers' is action, drama, comedy; but most of all, 'Four Brothers' is inspiration. A movie making money is a hit. A movie making millions is a chart-topper. But a movie making memories- that's a success.",Four Brothers

I knew this would be an awesome movie and it was! The audience was also clapping and cheering at this movie! I was on the edge of my seat and loving every second of it. The only thing predictable about this movie was that one of the brothers would get shot and he died, but not the one I thought would. Everyone thought differently. John Singleton took a predictable storyline and completely changed it around and that's what kept everyone on the edge of their seats. With some comedy and quick laughs thrown it for fun, this movie was awesome! I could not love Mark Wahlburg anymore! Great acting all around.

All that aside this movie was excellent. My heart pounds even now just writing about it. If you love action movies this is definitely a treat. The brothers relationship is touching, funny and completely convincing which is an important element that makes the movie so good. The 4 actors were well chosen for the parts and each character is distinctly different. You'll like all 4 of them for different reasons. Mark Wahlberg is great in this.

It was one of the best movies I seen with a combination of very good action, very good drama, lots of suspense, good acting, and even some comedy. Very well made movie, nothing overdone and very well scripted. It even had very well timed, perfectly made action sequences which were very heart-pounding. It keeps you on your toes the entire length of the movie and there is not much wasted time.I think if you are debating on what movie to see, pick this one. Best movie in a long time and well worth the money/time. 10/10 on all factors",Four Brothers
311,spikequeen2001,A great way to end the summer,10,16 August 2005,"A great way to end the summer with a huge action packed vengeance movie. Unlike most other action movies, it's not laden down with total explosions in every scene. Some comic lines were thrown in, as well as one very angry off Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg did an excellent job portraying Bobby Mercer, but the major surprise was Andre 3000. With with no huge acting experience, he took on the role and nailed it perfectly. With the help of Garrett Hedlund and Tyrese Gibson, ""Four Brothers"" showed how one diverse family can come together to avenge their mother. Not just a shoot and kill movie, there are sequences that show the brothers' ""other"" side as well.",Four Brothers
312,Dcm3387,Better then expected.,9,17 August 2005,"This movie was a lot better then I have expected which says a lot since I've seen many, many movies. When I saw the Trailer, I was a bit skeptical about the whole thing but Marky Mark gave me a reason to see it. I've enjoyed ""Italian Job"" and other movies he had been in so I had decided to check it out.The acting in this movie was impressive by each cast individual. The storyline was deep and expanding, branching off into different directions for each of the character.My favorite character, Jack had the most unique storyline of them all that left his past opened for pretty much any possibilities. Garrett Hedlund has a lot of potential and I hope to see him in more movies in the future.So in general, this movie had outdid itself more then I could imagine. Thougn no movie is never perfect, and this is no different, I gave it a high rating because I walked in feeling disappointed but came out satisfied instead of the other way around.",Four Brothers
313,morfiel,Four Brothers,10,19 August 2005,"Great movie! Great story line, and actors are terrific. The only thing, is why did they kill Jack?. I hope on DVD they make a Alternative Ending, where all four brothers are alive. Please, make and AU ending. OVerall it's a great movie. Storyline was good, and it's a great movie. I hope there will be an AU. I love how actors played, it's not only about revenge. It's a brotherhood, how family strong for each other. See the movie, you won't be sorry. I give it 10/10. I never cried on movies, but I did on several scenes: one when they had a dinner, and second when Jack died.And Jack, he was very good, little faerie. Jokes are priceless, and Bobi is great.",Four Brothers
314,kfrance4915,Horrible,2,18 August 2005,"This is just a bad movie plain and simple. The story is full of trite scenes and flashbacks that make you want to roll your eyes and do nothing to build any attachment to the plot or characters.There are a few scenes with some humor and a couple of action sequences are pretty good. The acting is decent, Wahlberg is a fine job and did some of the other brothers, but the pathetic story is just horribly stupid and overwhelmes any redeeming qualities this film has.The final action scene...what a revenge movie is all about...was boring it also was one of the stupidest three minutes of my life. I couldn't wait for this movie to end, and it did't end soon enough.",Four Brothers
315,mikebavli,"Marky Mark, Andre 3000 and Tyrese walk into a bar...",4,20 August 2005,"While giving this film a 4/10, I have to make certain qualifiers. If what you have come for is a double helping of playfully gratuitous violence with a refreshingly illiberal side of misogyny, then, odds are, 'Four Brothers' is for you. Nevertheless, to enjoy this movie, means to disregard plot-holes that are too numerous to count and bland, amateur acting across the board. Then again, what can you expect from a film whose three main stars were initially famous for their music, and modeling really gay-looking underwear at Times Square? It's also worth noting that Detroit is a uniquely dilapidated, depressing place. In a better 'Four Brothers,' this circumstance would have allowed for an interesting relationship between the cinematography and the plot. In the one were we are served by the studio, it just makes everything dark, snowy and, for lack of a better word, crappy-looking.",Four Brothers
316,undeaded07,Not Worth Your Time or Money,3,21 August 2005,"Throughly mediocre action movie. Everything is badly over-dramatized, and the plot tries to be layered, but just ends up messy. It redeems itself slightly with a few witty cracks, however in the end it seems like a bad adaptation of a video-game onto the silver screen. The actors do a fairly decent job considering what they've been given to work with, but Mark Wahlberg's character (Bobby Mercer) is so over the top that no acting job can save him. He seems to be a bad clone of Samuel L. Jackson's character in Pulp Fiction - minus everything that made him so great. The action scenes themselves deliver what they promise - if not particularly well. Many of the action scenes seem rather tacked on, and the actually contents of them is often so unrealistically stupid that it's hard to get sucked in.",Four Brothers
317,Mastermind937-1,Riveting action flick! You will not be disappointed!,8,21 August 2005,"This was an outstanding action picture from start to finish. The movie is a hip-hop version of the 1965 western ""The Sons of Katie Elder"". I was very impressed by the chemistry between the four main actors. However, I wish that the movie could have explored each of the main characters more, but that would be asking for too much in the time period alloted. On the other hand the movie is made without the special effects that are becoming the norm in this era. By removing the special effects and concentrating on pure action the movie is reminiscent of the old action flicks of the 70's. This is one of John Singleton's best movies, although the most unheralded. The movie is the sleeper of the year!",Four Brothers
318,lmmr1234,Amazing movie,9,22 August 2005,"I recently saw this movie in theatre's and let me just say, it was a stellar piece of filmography. The directing was solid, the story was interesting, the film itself however, played second fiddle to the superb acting of ODEEN ECCLESTON. I write her name all in capitals because her acting is so amazing that she cannot be compared to the mere mortal who has only two or three capitals in their name. Her portrayal of ""gang member"" couldn't have been more accurate unless she was wearing her ESC sweater. ODEEN!! she not only felt the character, she also shared an honest view to some, of what its like to be a struggling youth growing up in this upside down, work a day world. ODEEN!! The acting skill of this thespian moved me so much, that i gouged my eyes out of my skull because i never wanted to watch another movie again. If she ever stars in her own feature film, i will faction a pair of robot eyes, or have someone explain the movie to me in graphic detail. in retrospect, her acting moved mountains. I rated this movie a 9 out of 10 due to the fact that it lacked hours of odeen. ODEEN!!",Four Brothers

Mark Wahlberg as ""bobby"" was the best of all 4 brothers! at least i thought so! he was the leader of the group and he made split second choices and never cared the consequences! not to mention, he was just hillarioussssssssssssssssssssss straight up! i was laughing so hard hes too funny! i think personally Mark is what made the movie what it is! but all the actors did an amazing job and i don't think i can think of any other actors to play the brothers except them! the plot was awesome, the action was nuts and i don't think iv ever been so jumpy in a movie before! i was literally jumpin out of my seat! i loved this movie so much and i cant wait till its out on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Four Brothers
320,jeckets,the soundtrack is by far the best part of this film,3,25 August 2005,"I was definitely looking forward to this movie, which is not hard to imagine for a John Singleton movie, especially with the cast its got. I love Mark Wahlburg, and couldn't wait to see Andre Benjamin's big screen debut, bla, bla, bla, BUT what a total disappointment! Actually those two were good, Tyrese too, but the story and dialogue were weak at best. I spent most of the movie wondering why people were doing what they were doing, why I should care about these thinly drawn, backgroundless and insubstantial characters, and who wrote that weak and chiche' dialogue that started out bad, oversimplified, and patronizing, and stayed that way. I kept wanting it to get better, and that was all that kept me from walking out before it was over.This movie is sloppy...for example...The opening scene in the store, does anyone find the mother's scolding words to the shoplifter believable at all? As if he'd be in there stealing one Tootsie Roll! What kid from Detroit that age would be duped by that ""I'm on hold with the police"" act? Why do they continue to allude to the youngest brother's ""bad things in his past"" but never resolve it. And for that matter they make it seem like it was some sort of sexual abuse but the guy is comfortable enough to shower in the open bathroom with people walking in and out? And if all four of them were such ""lost causes"" and ""bad kids"" and whatnot, don't they all have big issues in their pasts, why just make us aware of the one and none of the others? Where did the gun go when Tyrese goes to the cop's house, he answers the door with a gun behind his back and then when they get into the fight, he never even raises the hand where the gun is. Why? Where did it go? At the end when they're on the frozen river, driving on fresh snow in one shot and then following multiple car tracks in the next. AND when they're all standing around and the camera goes to a wide shot, WHY do you see all of those rectangular melted spots in the ice where there were obviously other vehicles parked. (production vehicles perhaps?) WHY SO THOUGHTLESS AND SLOPPY from such an otherwise quality filmmaker?",Four Brothers

322,gbs263,"A Must See!!, Surprising Twists make this a Can't-Miss-wish-for-a-sequel! (maybe called Three Brothers?)",10,28 August 2005,"Wow! This movie took my breath away, twisted it and threw it back at me in a mass of chaotic thrilling action. When my friends and I left the theater, we were so excited. Wahlberg definitely deserves an Oscar for his dramatic, riveting, and hilariously funny yet antithetical performance. How can someone who is so strong have such a soft side??The way the four brothers (now Three) were devoted to their mother was heartwarming. Yet, they backed down from no one, as evidenced by their stern intestinal fortitude against the evil Victor Sweet (who was not sweet at all).I must say, the toilet scene, was a Singleton masterpiece. It was one of several key scenes and direction that really show the cutting edge and unapologetic style, reminiscent of John Landis. What about that frozen lake scene? When have we seen such a battle out on the ice? Come on, only Singleton can come up with this stuff! And it blows the Coen brothers ""Fargo"" scenes, out of the ice water. Watching Mark Wahlberg walking on water (like Jesus?), saving humanity from itself was truly a depiction of cinematographic wonder.Also, the camera work from the inside of the car trunk draws the audience closer to the nether regions of the director's mind. Not since ""Fargo"" have we seen such a thrilling blizzard-drenched chase scene. The ferocity of the elements fused with the intensity of the scene, becoming one with the emotion of the chase. Separately, the elements work fine, but together, they blend ones taste for excitement to perfection much like a robust sundae dredged with hot fudge, nuts and whipped cream. The proverbial cherry on top is the flipping of the car. They could have just assassinated the antagonist (gang-style), but instead, they drew us into the depths. You must see this movie. I only wish the sequel would come out much sooner. Hooray for Singleton! He raised the bar to new, unheard of heights, higher than three-time world record breaker Isaac Bershette's latest sheath toss.",Four Brothers
323,Brennfl,"Solid, Professional Work",8,28 August 2005,"There's a sequence not too far into ""Four Brothers"" that combines a decrepit apartment building, three of the brothers chasing a bad guy, staircases, an elevator, a 6-floor apartment, a long hallway, and two attack dogs (guns, too).John Singleton does such a great job creating suspense, moving the action along, making it exciting that the sequence should be used in film school to illustrate just what can be done with simple elements well used.Not a perfect movie, but Singleton and the cast are clearly experienced professionals succeeding in making a movie that works. Sure, four brothers avenging their mom's murder leads to Screen writing 101, all clichés all the time -- but ""Four Brothers"" is solid and fun to watch.Mark Wahlberg is the movie's star, and does an excellent job, but all four of the brothers add solid performances, as do Josh Charles and Terrence Howard as cops",Four Brothers

I have read some of the comments; This is a movie not real life (thankfully) I loved this movie and yes there are some holes in it; but the actors are so good that the you only think about the holes for a minute; the action is not too over the top; I am probably one of the oldest people to comment on this movie; but there is so many ""good"" movies that I consider junk; this movie kept my interest the whole time. I am not a fan of any of the actors, but I like them a lot better today. These are three hot heads and a wanna be (Jerry); who react naturally when something they love has been taken away. Stop thinking that this is a black movie and see it as a ""family"" movie. As far as the sound track yep! gotta get it.

Too many tired jokes and clichés. Too many people got shot for no apparent reason.

Actors are often called talent but sadly looking at this pile of steaming manure it is hard to see why. Marky Mark possesses all the subtlety of a skunk's fart. His kid brother played by Garrett Hedlund looks like he had a rancid burger a while back and still hasn't recovered. Andre 3000bc should stick to being an average musician and not try to be a below par actor. And as for the other one, Tyrese Gibson - he should go back to appearing on Moesha. The script is ludicrous, the dialogue laughable and in charge of this whole quagmire of idiocy is John Singleton who has directed a decent film since Boyz n the Hood. Honestly don't even bother. Unless you like your movies loud, dumb and pointless you should spend 90 minutes starring at the wall; you mightn't learn much but at least it won't insult you.",Four Brothers

I have been disappointed with recent attempts of action films, as they overly complicate matters with bogus unbelievable plot and horribly cliché and misplaced lines, but this movie does a great job of providing plenty of action packed blood n guts for amusement, while also delivering a movie with some content. The delivery of lines is awesome, and had many in the theater laughing out loud, while the actors did a good job of pretending to be a band of brothers. They do a very good job of representing the brotherly love, with constant teasing yet looking after each other. Looks like it was shot on location, and adds a more real feeling to the movie. While it still has many of the unbelievable gunfights, some effort has been made to make it slightly more realistic. Overall a great action packed film.",Four Brothers

If I didn't live on the ground floor, I probably would have thrown myself out of a window whilst watching this film. Here are a few of the worst scenes:When the brothers find out that it was an execution, and they march off down the street, with macho swinging arms. Pathetic.All of the ""dream"" sequences with their mother talking to them. Cringe inducing. I almost cried for the actors having to do these scenes. Any scene containing Marky Mark.The fist fight at the end was embarrassing. Neither character kept their hands up, they both should have been knocked out.The car chase. Terrible. Most cars, let alone automatics, couldn't do any of that stuff on ice. Overall, I hated all the characters, they were terribly acted, terribly written parts, and they were all thugs.

In this movie four guys return home after the passing of their mom only to find out there something wrong and darker thats the reason for her death(Just like S.O.K.E.). The sons have a reputation for being a little much to handle and now with finding out there might be more going on behind their moms death. As they say in the hood "" It's on Muther#&*%$*!""

Even as just another dumb action movie, it so dumb you can't help but get annoyed. On the back of the DVD it said that it was an emotional drama, but there nothing emotional about it because non of the characters had any depth. The mother in the movie was also badly casted and in the few scenes in which she plays her part, you hardly develop sympathy for her because she looks and acts ridiculous. Finally, there is no movie more predictable than this one. In the past Donnie Wahlberg has proved that he can really act, but in this movie all he can do is fight.

The cast is also very good and each actor did great with the characters. This is a movie that can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. If you don't have the movie buy it or rent it.

This was a stunning movie when I got into it.I did expect great action though, but Four Brothers was beyond that. It both showed great emotion, and at the same time stunning action. When it got emotional, I got the shivers and almost tears, and when they were fighting I was sitting on top of the seat with a raised fist and shouting (quite embarrassing, actually =D). Anyways, as I wrote in the headline. It has great emotional depths, and at the same time it holds your attention with the somewhat extremely violent action scenes.This is a movie which can give you great experiences, but it requires your full attention.

Same basic plot line - good hearted woman raises four bad boys who come home after she dies to avenge her death. However the storyline in this version has more holes in it than a pound of swiss cheese, but considering the intended audience that probably doesn't matter. (Example, the brothers chase/shoot at/beat up various villains in broad daylight in Detriot on totally deserted streets. Has the city been abandoned?) Younger audiences will like the action and shoot 'em up scenes which tend to make the brothers' characters unsympathetic heroes. The dialog is laced with four letter words, so keep the kids away from this one. Some of the players in this movie simply cannot act - which actually lends a bit of realism to the film.

This movie did an excellent job of putting both together in a satisfying way, but took the mindless out of anything. The mixed emotions one gets from this movie is spectacular, and you don't realize how much emotion there was until after you see the movie.

It almost seems like they are real brothers because of the way the portrayed their characters. Bobby was by far the best character in the movie. Bobby was the true older brother who stood up for his family and what he believed in which is always good in a character.There was one part in the movie where they show Garrett Hedlund getting out of the shower which was on of my favorite parts in the movie. Yes that was a good part but the movie as a whole was amazing.",Four Brothers
345,alasdair_st_george,Great Movie!! Both times I saw it.,8,1 January 2006,"I loved this movie!! It was moving and emotionally sound. I nearly cried when they were all at the kitchen table, I know I warned a spoiler but you have to watch the movie if you want to know what I'm talking about! However I noticed how very closely it resembled ""The Son's of Katie Elder"".I was wondering why no credit was given when it is obvious to me anyway that it was nearly the very same movie save for a few differences in the back story. Ultimately while watching this film I was curious as to how they were going to handle the different twists and turns that were offered in the old John Wayne flick, and was pleased each and every time I was shown the way.Either which way I loved the movie it was well crafted, remake or not!If you liked this movie and have not yet seen ""The Son's of Katie Elder"" then by all means go get it today.",Four Brothers
346,yaya7747,Four brothers,10,7 January 2006,"I've seen this movie some times ago and I must confess that I've fallen in love with it.I think the actors' play is very well done, Mark Wahlberg perfectly incarnates the biggest of the family, the leader, by trying to hide his sadness and to find his mother's murderer.Tyrese Gibson, well known thanks to the movie 2 Fast and 2 furious, plays the role of a macho in love with a Latina girl who makes them being in trouble. But he has his great part in the movie by trying to know why his brother Jeremiah is broken.Andre Benjamin is the wisest of the family. He has stopped his silly things to invest himself in his own family. He's a great father and husband. But is project is destroy when he learns that he's broken. He decides to use his mom's insurance to pay his bills towards the men who broke him.And my favorite, Garrett Hedlund, saw in Troie, who's the youngest of the group. He's a "" 3rd type rocker"", very naive. He's very protected by his brother Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and it makes him be the most sensitive of them. He's landing in the adults' world and it's a great chock for him to lose his mom (who saved him from his moral injuries) and to see that his brothers can kill without any remorse.I advice everybody to see this movie he's very well done ...",Four Brothers
347,ama_331,I loved this movie,10,11 January 2006,"It really hit me how real the picture seemed Jack, Bobby, Jerry and Angel Mercer are all so different yet the same just like real bro's. There was amazing acting out of all four especially Garrett (only his third movie!) who had to create so many emotional scenes. Mark as usual was also great and Andre and Tyrese were very good too. It really hit home with me how these boys were so unwanted and the great kindness of one women that saved them all...sadly it was that very kindness and love that took her to her grave. The characters themselves were really believable as I said before and the story line was great...many said it was predictable but I didn't think so when I saw it for the first time.",Four Brothers
348,cowboymike-35200,Ive seen this movie before. Has John Wayne and Dean Martin,5,21 October 2020,"This is gonna be short and quick. Its essentially a retelling of one of my favorite westerns. Told in a modern inner city vibe. The only reason I'm writing this review is none I saw. That evem mentioned the movie sons katie elder. Its a great movie. The characters are well done, the acting the same. But watch the movie 'sons of katie elder'",Four Brothers
349,yourlocalninja,I loved this movie!!,10,15 February 2006,"I really loved this movie!! When I saw the trailer for it in theaters, I wanted to see it but no one else did. So I finally rented it when it came out. My jaw dropped when I saw it. The movie is great and the actors who played the brother were fantastic.They really came off as brothers.MArk Walhberg came off as the big brother and he really cared for the brothers. Tyrese was perfect as the brother who was there to back up what Bobby said. Garrett Hedlund was awesome as the rocker brother and Andre Benjamin was perfect for the good guy part. This movie has all the emotions that you'd want and feel if you were one of them. John Singleton did a fantastic job casting the brothers and he did a great job on the movie in general. I wasn't too sure what I'd get when I saw this movie,but I can honestly say that I loved it and was glad I saw it! I give this movie a 10.If you like action movies,this is for you. Go,watch the movie,then go judge for yourself! Hopefully you wont be disappointed.",Four Brothers
350,ramsdude47,best movie ever,10,18 January 2006,"most definitely my favorite movie, watched it 3 times in 4 days and loved it every time. There was never a dull part in the movie that did not have me interested. I honestly do not see how the average for this movie is 6.7 because I'm shocked this movie didn't blow out box office records. Just talking about it right now makes me want to go and watch it again!!! My favorite character would have to be Angel, he tears some gangsters down!! It is sweet to see the Mercer's get their revenge. Now I'm from the suburbs so i do not know if crime is really that bad in the city, but it seemed realistic to me that something like that could happen in a city like Detroit.",Four Brothers
351,savanna_ayala,We loved it and there should be a sequel,7,27 January 2006,"I really liked this movie and a lot of my friends also enjoyed it. I think that there should be a sequel to it. We did not like that Jack died. That was a shocker to everyone but we were glad that they did get their revenge. A lot of my friends who watch it with me are like how come bobby and jack don't have girls. I think that they should have a soundtrack from the movie cause we liked the music also. We were confused when Sweet's gang turned on him, because there was no warning to that coming at all. But we all really enjoyed bobby beating the day lights out of him. If you have not seen this movie you should really go out and see it because it is totally worth it.",Four Brothers
352,belindahenryruffin,Detroit The Bomb !!!!!,10,20 August 2018,Four Brothers is one of my all time FAVORITE MOVIES that has an all time favorite cast and is also focused on one of my favorite city's in the U.S. which is Detroit Michigan although this movie has been out for a long time those who haven't seen it yet I highly suggest that you do !!!! And just so that you know NO CHILDREN SHOULD BE ALLOWED !!!! Belinda,Four Brothers
353,tupolevs,Poor acting and a stupid story,1,2 August 2007,"Pretty often a bad movie has a bad rating on this site after enough people have seen it. This is not the case with some of the really bad action movies, especially the ones that contain some decent action but besides from that are completely worthless.This is the case with Four brothers, the story makes no sense, and the acting is very poor. Usually I am one of those that has to finish watching a movie no matter how bad it is, just to see if it might not improve somewhat, but this movie was so bad that I actually had to turn it of halfway in. And no, I am pretty sure it did not get any better.(For the record, I did not even turn of ""the stone merchant"" (for those of you who have seen it), but painfully watched the full movie the other day. Something which surely must tell you how bad a movie must be before I turn it off.",Four Brothers
354,James_Blunts_Monkey,Bloody brilliant.,10,2 April 2007,"To begin with, I'll just say that this was the best non-epic film I've ever seen. I was sceptical originally, but this film just totally blew my mind. I didn't think gangster movies could get this insanely good. But Four Brothers is. The general idea (though most people reading this will already know) is this: Four adopted brothers (the Mercers) reunite in Detroit (the ex-hometown of 3 of them) to bury their murdered mother. Bobby and Angel (Mark Wahlberg and Tyrese Gibson) are your average degenerates, and the oldest of the lot. Jerry (Andre Benjamin) is a family man trying to make something of his hopeless life, and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) is the youngest, and the most messed up. It doesn't take long for the brothers to decide the investigation by the police isn't going to be enough, and thats when the fun begins. One of the great things about this movie is that its not just some excuse to shoot a lot of people. The whole start of the film is spent establishing the strong bonds the brothers share. They aren't like actors pretending to be brothers, they're just like brothers. It sounds insulting to say that they're acting, its that good. The dialogue isn't the stuff of intellectuals. The language is bad, the jokes crude (but non-the-less often hilarious), but it doesn't seem out of place or gratuitous. It all works toward building up the atmosphere, and it works perfectly. The action scenes are great. Action isn't really my thing, but this I enjoyed. The humour helped out through most of these scenes (though toward the end of the movie, it subsided, which is just as well, the last few action scenes being too intense to allow for jokes), and it was a lot of fun to watch. But the thing that really drew me in to the film was the emotional side: There wasn't any of that 'we're so tough, we never cry' sh!t that you see so often in Hollywood movies. It was very realistic, and thats something that Hollywood usually skips out on. (Unfortunately). The characters had feelings and motives (other than plain violent revenge), and it worked. I'm not big on crying in movies, but this one got me. Some films are sad, and some are just devastating. I was devastated. Kudos go to Mark Wahlberg and Garrett Hedlund for their performances: Bobby was charismatic (most of his lines were improvised), hot-headed, and just plain brilliant to watch. Jack was damaged, and Garrett Hedlund did a beautiful, subtle job putting across the inner-workings of his characters mind. The 'bad things' that had happened to Jack before he joined the Mercer family are never really mentioned, but the impression is strong. I was really intrigued by him. Hedlund would have been just 20 at the time, and its no wonder his career is taking off so well. He was picked up for a part in Troy (thats a blockbuster movie there) within a month of moving to LA. He ain't just a pretty face: you don't get picked up that fast if you aren't talented. Bobby and Jack's relationship is a wonderful thing: Jack is notably Bobby's favourite, and he protects his little brother as best he can, though he gives him as hard a time as possible. They confide in one another, and I'm glad the film makers weren't too busy making Bobby macho to do that. Overall, I just have to say that I was completely amazed by how incredible this movie was. Its the kind of movie that might appeal to both males and females, having combined the elements stereo-typically loved by either sex. Absolutely worth the money, I recommend it above all things. Movies this good are rare, so don't miss your chance.",Four Brothers
355,heritage_01,Have you heard of John Wayne?,5,17 February 2006,"One movie comes to mind...The Sons of Katie Elder. John Wayne, Dean Martin...mother dies...sons are completely opposite of each other. Each are suspicious of Mom's death. Time to avenge the woman the whole town loved.Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie but I'm less than a third of the way through it and suddenly it all seems too familiar! Only, with lots of colorful expletives and sex!! Not too original. The best part of the movie being the pretext of 4 adopted brothers from completely different worlds.I will say, Mark Wahlberg always makes me smile with his efforts to seem mean. He comes across as the angry but secretly a softy brother of the four. Isn't that what he does best?",Four Brothers
356,sjevons,Don't do it...,3,21 March 2006,"That's 2 hours of my life I'm never getting back. I watched Four Brothers without knowing anything about it which usually minimises the risk of being seriously disappointed...but not in this case. The acting was terrible, the script and direction laughable, and who the hell is this Garrett Hedlund character? The film was bad anyway but he was seriously miscast - a relative of Singleton perhaps? Chiwetel Ejiofor is an excellent actor with a number of awards under his belt - what was he doing in this film? I know when a film seems bad to me when either I am moved to write a comment or I couldn't care less whether the main characters make it to the end of the film or not. And Four Brothers fulfilled both those criteria. Really, give it a miss.",Four Brothers

Tonight my friends are to chicken to write this so i am!

359,mil3045,"Decent Film, I Likey",7,27 March 2006,"Well me and my mate (another member on here) rented this out Friday night to watch as we thought to give it a try from the good comments we heard about it before.From finishing watching it at 2am we thought it was a really good film for all. It's not the typical gangster film in a way that it isn't shooting every 5 minutes and they don't go round mugging people with black bandannas on around there faces.Yes, it does have some scenes of violence and they are really well produced, kinda reminded of GTA: San Andreas the game for some reason. Family got each others back n all.Overall a film for all to watch that are into this stuff. :)",Four Brothers
360,sarabirdkw-1,Awesome,10,24 April 2006,"I originally thought this was going to be another ""gang wars"" type movie but threw caution to the winds & went anyway. Wow ... was I surprised!! As a middle aged woman I absolutely LOVED this flick !! It's a violent love story that will appeal to men & women alike. The violence in the movie is justified & the acting on all parts I thought was superb. I immediately bought the DVD when it came out & have watched it at least 4 times since I bought it home. It taught me not to judge the book by the cover. Take a chance & experience Four Brothers for yourself & you'll find family love is indeed color blind .. as it should be. Guys.. great car chase in snow storm & great shoot outs. Great ride from start to finish.",Four Brothers
