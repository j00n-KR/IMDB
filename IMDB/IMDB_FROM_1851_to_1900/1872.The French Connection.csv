0,MartinHafer,An important film due to its impact on the genre,8,28 October 2007,"While the 1960s brought us a slew of anti-heroes that even made their way to police films, predecessors such as BULLIT and MADIGAN are tame compared to this ground-breaking film. While these previous films gave a much bleaker view of police work and corruption, THE FRENCH CONNECTION was unique in the intensity of the sleaze that permeates the film. In most ways, this serves to heighten the realism, though even today some viewers will blanch at the films frequent use of the f-word and the general griminess of the city. Fortunately, in recent trips to the city, I was pleased to see how clean and safe the New York has become, but for the New York City office of tourism, this film must have been a nightmare!! Junkies, garbage, murders and the lowest elements frequent this interpretation of the Big Apple--making it look a bit worm-eaten and squishy! The lead of the film is Gene Hackman and his quiet partner is Roy Scheider. Hackman's character, in particular, made it hard to differentiate him from the criminals because he played fast and loose with some people's rights and because he was prone to getting drunk and picking up one night stands. This was definitely NOT the cop your daddy would have seen in films in the good old days and I am pretty sure Jack Webb didn't approve of this Popeye Doyle character!!!Despite the seaminess of the film, it was a great detective film because of its exceptional action sequences that made up for the very mundane nature of the job. Long periods of wire tapping and grunt work were punctuated with some of the most exciting scenes in film history--including what most experts would concede is the best chase scene on film. Additionally, the script and direction made the film quite exciting and gritty--thanks also to improvisations to spice up the cop lingo. In so many ways, this film helped create a new type of police film and led to movies such as SERPICO, THE BLUE KNIGHT and the DIRTY HARRY films. See this film and see where it all began--as this was the first rated-R cop film to win the Oscar for Best Picture and STILL today is a film you don't want to let your kids watch (unless you are an irresponsible idiot).",The French Connection
1,TheLittleSongbird,Superb cop flick,10,24 November 2010,"Whether it was the best movie of the year is up for debate, but that does not mean The French Connection is a bad film. In fact, it is a superb film. It is very well made, it has a hard edge, is well directed, has a fine script, some very memorable sequences, is well scored and Gene Hackman once again is superb in the lead. I like cop flicks just as much as the next person, and I have to say The French Connection is one of the best of them. Not only does it have all the things I mentioned above, but I think it has aged well and it is definitely worth seeing more than once. All in all, superb, worth seeing for Hackman. 10/10 Bethany Cox",The French Connection
2,bkoganbing,One Kinky Cop,7,3 June 2009,"The French Connection and Bullitt have had so many imitators over the past 40 years it's almost impossible to remember that the clichés about police films had their start with these two. Still they did set a standard and should be remembered for that.My basic problem with The French Connection is the lack of any character development other than Gene Hackman's role. Even his opposite number Fernando Rey is presented as a cool counterpoint to Hackman's Popeye Doyle, narcotics detective who lucked into one of the biggest heroin busts of all time.Popeye is one of the most unlikely heroes ever portrayed in film. He's a racist bigot, a chauvinistic pig, he's even got a couple of kinks in his sexual persona. I don't think it's an accident that around the time Gene Hackman got his Best Actor Oscar, All In The Family debuted on television with its more lovable version of Popeye. Archie Bunker and Popeye Doyle would have hit it off great. I could see the two of them at Kelsey's Bar in Queens.Some surveillance at a candy store pays off big time for Hackman and his partner Roy Scheider, but they don't even know how big. Over in Marseilles, Fernando Rey is planning to bring in one big shipment of pure heroin for mobster Tony LoBianco to sell. It's just a question of waiting and watching.Hackman's not even good at that as Rey gives him the slip on a subway surveillance. Later on in a scene that rivals the car chase in Bullitt, Hackman commandeers a car and chases down one of the gang who holds a subway hostage, I think it's the Sea Beach train a stop or two from Coney Island if memory serves.The French Connection is based on a book written Green Berets author Robin Moore as told to him by Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, the cops who did the actual bust. Both appear in the film in supporting roles. If Popeye is supposed to be Egan, all I can say is that this man told his story in the Cromwell tradition, warts and all.Big warts at that.",The French Connection
3,Leofwine_draca,Tough as nails,9,14 April 2014,"THE FRENCH CONNECTION is a great cop thriller set in the down and dirty streets of New York. It's certainly no epic along the lines of THE GODFATHER, nor does it attempt to expose the grittiness of real life like SERPICO. Instead, it's a straightforward action thriller, loaded to the brim with violence and exceptional chase sequences.William Friedkin is a director who gets all of the plaudits for THE EXORCIST, but for me SORCERER is his best film and this a close second. It gets to the heart of the matter, depicting a cat-and-mouse battle between cops and drug smugglers and wringing every drop of suspense from the premise. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider are pitch perfect as the dogged twosome on the trail of uber-criminal Fernando Rey.The film has lots of fun moments, but the highlight has to be that extended chase sequence, which seems to go on for about half an hour and never once becomes dull, predictable or repetitive. It truly is a great moment of cinema, visceral and exciting throughout, and really the rest of the plot serves to bookend it. Great stuff.",The French Connection
4,SnoopyStyle,Great all around with iconic car subway chase,9,3 July 2014,"Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) is a big time french gangster heroin smuggler. He is bringing a huge shipment into NYC. Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) is a tough angry bigot who knows the streets. Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) is his younger sidekick who's got his back. The partners investigate small time Brooklyn crook Sal Boca leading to bigger crooks with the french connection.Director William Friedkin has created one of the classic 70s action thriller. The basic story is a simple police crime drama. It's the shooting style that makes it a classic. It has a lot of gritty documentary style of run and gun. It adds some needed energy in the usual meandering 70s style. Then there is the eye popping subway car chase shooting from inside and outside the car racing down the street. It still holds up because it's got the modern quick edit pacing and the imaginative camera placements. It sets the standard that all car chases must measure up to from then on. It's not until CGI does the action car chase get any truly new innovation. Gene Hackman has never been better in his long illustrious career. Roy Scheider makes his bones in this one and would become one of the biggest stars of the 70s. Mostly, this and 'The Exorcist' cements William Friedkin as one of the great Hollywood directors.",The French Connection
5,Hitchcoc,Copied Numerous Times,8,20 March 2010,"This film came out almost 40 years ago. At the time, it was really innovative. I had to divorce my reaction which is ho-hum and remember that there hadn't been 500 films with similar issues and off-the-wall cops at the time. Popeye Doyle is almost a sociopath. He has no sense of the sanctity of life. Sure, those drug dealers deserve whatever they get, but what about the collateral damage? He puts people in danger. Is indirectly responsible for a mother getting killed. Obviously, much isn't his fault, but the only time he shows emotion is when one of these guys eludes him. The car chase is really amazing, but put in any realistic context, all the events lead to more innocent people dying or being badly injured. Why is a capture worth that? I did like the dismantling of the car to search for the drugs. That is about as close to anything humorous in the whole film. It does portray the Seventies very well. Of course, Hackman is great. Slimmer and younger and really fast. I could watch him forever. Nevertheless, while it is a dynamically produced drama, I can't separate myself from the victimization in the name of justice.",The French Connection
6,classicsoncall,"""You still picking your feet in Poughkeepsie""?",7,20 May 2011,"I'm an upstate New York guy, so the quote in my summary line is what stayed the longest with me after forty years since first seeing the film. That, and the car chase scene, dubious in hindsight as it was a single vehicle keeping pace with an overhead railway train careening toward an abrupt stop. I think the nostalgia for the picture is what keeps it current today, but it's taken a hit on the American Film Institute's ranking of the Top 100 movies, falling from number seventy in 1997 to ninety three a decade later. Not surprising, and will probably fall off the list altogether with the passage of time. Still, it's not a bad film, one of the best examples I can come up with for capturing the gritty flavor of New York City neighborhoods with their bodegas, liquor stores and newspaper stands. You can call the picture dated, but there are parts of the city that still look like that today, particularly in Brooklyn and the Bronx.It was a little surprising catching Gene Hackman in the picture when I watched it earlier today, looking younger than his actual age of forty at the time. Could be that dopey hat took a few years off. Roy Scheider always looks pretty much the same to me, my image of him as an actor established while fighting that big fish a few years later. Together they made a fair enough team, but I didn't get the kind of cop chemistry that usually goes with these pictures. Tango and Cash, Starsky and Hutch - Popeye and Cloudy? See what I mean? And by the way, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think I heard Scheider's character called Buddy once, the name he's given in the cast credits.Another reviewer on this board made an interesting point about the drug car being dismantled and put back together again. Not likely in the least. My own thought was they replaced the vehicle with a look alike, but even so, what were the odds of either possibility being a realistic one? That was a head scratcher, almost as much as Doyle getting away with killing a federal officer. You know, if I keep on going, I might talk myself into not liking the picture, which would be a shame because there were some cool moments too. Like Popeye working over the undercover informant at the bar, and the clever cat and mouse game with Charnier on the subway. With those flourishes, the film built enough steam to gain it's reputation as a pioneer in the genre, though one would have to concede that it's heyday as an influential film has long passed.",The French Connection
7,gavin6942,Nothing Like Some Classic Gene Hackman...,8,23 September 2006,"Before Gene Hackman was Lex Luthor, he was a narcotics cop hell-bent on catching drug traffickers between America and France. In this real story, Hackman tracks down dealers while fighting his own alcoholism and addiction to picking up questionable women (a woman who is in one scene on a bicycle and in the next in a bedroom with handcuffs).This film is so well-done, the story so great... although based on a true story, I suspect this movie inspired other cop movies for decades afterwards. I can think of no movie prior to 1971 with such intense stakeouts and police chases. They probably exist, but I do not know them. Welcome to the modern police film.Hackman was great, fighting his own problems while becoming obsessed with the drug case he was working: going off of wild hunches and even dismantling a car down to the bolts to find drugs everyone else thinks are nowhere to be found. Roy Scheider, who I know primarily from ""Jaws"", plays the straight man partner. No boozing or women for him, but a friendship that helps carry out the will of Hackman.The best part of this film is without a doubt the car chase scene, where a police car chases a train. Breezing through intersections and smashing through walls, this scene is incredibly intense. I think Dirty Harry took a few lessons from this chase. Allegedly one of the crashes is completely real (the car hit was not driven by an actor) which only gives this scene even more credit.This is a film for those who like the classics, car chases, drug busts and Gene Hackman.",The French Connection
8,lee_eisenberg,Either way...,9,20 February 2006,"No doubt you've heard of the famous chase scene. Well you have to see it to believe it. ""The French Connection"" remains an impressive tour-de-force, although I wouldn't have given it Best Picture for 1971 (in my opinion, that distinction goes to ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller""). Needless to say, this pretty much paved the way for William Friedkin directing ""The Exorcist"", although since then, his career has faltered. As Det. Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, Gene Hackman creates as tough a cop as anyone could expect, and Roy Scheider and Fernando Rey are equally good as Buddy Russo and the smuggler, respectively. A real classic in every sense of the word.",The French Connection
9,jboothmillard,The French Connection,7,21 November 2006,"The first time I saw this I almost ignored it because I fell asleep somewhere, but I'm glad I gave it a second chance. There was no way I was going ignore a film from The Exorcist director William Friedkin, especially as this was the film that won him the Best Director Oscar. Anyway, it is all about Det. Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle (Oscar winning Gene Hackman) on the lookout for criminals planning to ship many drugs through the United States. Doyle knows quite a lot about the criminal world, and his work buddy Det. Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo (Oscar nominated Roy Scheider) is right behind him. I cannot remember all that much besides some chase sequences with the main villain, and the highlight of Doyle chasing the hit-man on the train. Also starring Fernando Rey as Alain Charnier, Tony Lo Bianco as Salvatore 'Sal' Boca, Marcel Bozzuffi as Pierre Nicoli the Hit Man, Frédéric De Pasquale as Henri Devereaux and Bill Hickman as Bill Mulderig. Winner of three other Oscars, Best Picture, Best Film Editing and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Sound. Gene Hackman was number 42 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 31 on The World's Greatest Actor, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle was number 44 on 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 70 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 74 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",The French Connection
10,ccthemovieman-1,Hard To Tell The Good Guys From The Bad,5,13 March 2007,"This is one of those ""gritty"" 1970s films that may have been well-filmed, acted, directed and received by critic and the public alike....but I never ""connected"" with it. I saw it at the theater, on TV and even bought the VHS tape, but no matter format I couldn't get involved with the story. I like crime movies, too.Sorry, but I like to have someone to root for. In this movies, the two main cops (Hackman and Scheider) are crude, profane low-life people and the rest of the characters are French or American drug dealers. I did find the surveillance work of ""Popeye Doyle"" (Hackman) and ""Buddy Russo"" (Scheider) interesting to watch and famous car chase scene is nothing spectacular nowadays. Yes, it was great in 1971 - but there haven been a number of better ones since. Heck, ""Ronin"" (1998) features two alone that are much better than anything in here. And, I am not thrilled at hearing the Lord's name used vain as often at it is in this movie. This is another icon of the decade I call ""The Sleazy Seventies.""",The French Connection
11,Tweekums,A classic gritty crime drama,9,16 February 2017,"While narcotics detectives Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle and his partner Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo are out in a New York bar they observe some suspicious characters and decide to follow one of them, Sal Boca. They are convinced that he is up to nothing good and start a proper investigation. Meanwhile in Marseilles Alain Charnier is preparing to take a large shipment of heroin to New York. When he gets to New York he is quickly spotted and tailed by Popeye although it isn't long before he realises he is being followed. There is then a constant game of cat and mouse as the police try to link Charnier, Boca and others to a drug shipment unfortunately finding the drugs will be far from easy.This film is rightly considered a classic; the central drama is exciting and the characters are interesting. Gene Hackman does a great job as Popeye Doyle; a character who is surprisingly unpleasant for a protagonist I know social attitudes have changed since 1971 but many of his racial slurs would still have been considered offensive back then. He is ably supported especially by Roy Scheider as his partner Buddy and Fernando Rey as the dapper French drug smuggler Alain Charnier. The City of New York is effectively a character as well; this isn't a bright shining New York but a run-down city with streets strewn with litter and a general feeling of decay; all of which contributes to a great atmosphere. Fans of a good car chase should be pleased as this includes a classic as Popeye chases a train; it isn't a particularly high speed chase but the crowded streets give it a realism and intensity one doesn't often get. There is some violence and strong language but this isn't particularly excessive; at least by today's standards. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fans of the genre.",The French Connection

13,moonspinner55,"""All right, Popeye's here!""",6,7 November 2021,"Hammering, combative, often confusing box-office giant from director William Friedkin, who won the Oscar for helming this adaptation of Robin Moore's nonfiction book set in New York City. Detectives in the Narcotics Division, Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman, also an Oscar winner) and his partner, ""Cloudy"" (Roy Scheider), shake down modern-day mobsters and a high-ranking lawyer involved in drug-smuggling operation. The grit is vivid and real--you can practically feel it on your fingertips. Friedkin is so in control of the camera, his kinetic energy becomes the movie's motor (he's as much of a star in the picture as is Hackman). The prologue in Marseille--which is supposed to set up the story--is stagnant, however, and nobody in the picture is at all likable (which of course was the idea: a new-fangled crime-drama wherein everybody and everything is scum). Also won Oscars for editing, Ernest Tidyman for his screenplay-adaptation, and for Best Picture. Followed in 1975 by a sequel.",The French Connection
14,Quinoa1984,"what Friedkin set out to do, he accomplished tremendously; Hackman's at a peak",10,29 August 2005,"Although not the very best film of 1971, The French Connection packs enough of a wallop to continue significance as a serious, but un-shamefully entertaining, thriller. William Friedkin, the director, has said about the film that he wanted to ""infuse the documentary style."" And in this rare time in Hollywood when the flood-gates opened, no one stopped him. This works for fascination on the technical side at the start, that all the edits in certain sequences (chases and such, not the notorious one), and particularly how they're filmed by the two significant cameramen, Owen Roizman and Enrique Bravo (the later the lighting cameramen. There were other films, mostly in Europe, that were making movies like this, but there is also this implicit urgency that Friedkin is conveying here as well; it's gritty, sometimes in the action there's so many chances of spontaneity that it can practically do no harm.But without going into detail about the specifics of the good in the style, one only has to look at the strengths in the story. For its time it broke ground in dealing frankly with the street/drug scene and its networking, even as by now there are thousands of TV programs and movies that show similar stuff every week. Yet there is a purity in it all too, where the story is so focused upon there isn't too much time for deep character delving and such. This doesn't make a problem for the actors though, as the actors fit the type like pegs. Gene Hackman, in his first Oscar winning turn, is Popeye Doyle, a cop with recklessness and total professionalism as one of the two key cop roles (the other, of course, Dirty Harry). It may not be Hackman's best, or some might say it is (whatever 'best' means), but it is one that compliments the film, essentially down the line and not un-willing to take prisoners. Roy Scheider is also well cast as Hackman's partner, with enough to do during Hackman's 'big' scenes. The surprise success in casting is Fernando Rey of Bunuel's films, who is one of the convincing old-European elegant big-time drug dealing business man in all of the films that followed it. It's almost as if the same character from those Bunuel films wasn't in a surreal-mode.This is just one of those 'cat & mouse' movies that clicks. For some the parts may even be greater than the whole (and they're practically on all highlights reels of clips from 70's films nowadays), and for others it may even prove more satisfying than it was for me.",The French Connection
15,michaelRokeefe,"Cop classic. ""Popeye"" Doyle becomes legendary.",7,26 February 2009,"This crime drama became a cult classic quickly. Director William Friedkin presents New York City's underbelly with brilliance. ""Popeye"" Doyle(Gene Hackman)is a colorful NYC Narcotics cop to say the least. He is bold, brash, vulgar and seems to fear nothing. When he plays a hunch it is not always right, but eventful. The tough-talking cop and his partner, and probably only real friend, Buddy Russo(Roy Scheider)are on to an international smuggling ring that actually begins in France. Doyle is like a bulldog on a bone, relentless in his pursuit of each and every suspect.One of my favorite scenes is when Doyle is tossing out a lousy cup of coffee as he watches a suspect in a fine restaurant drinking high class coffee. The pursuits on foot and even better the car chases make THE FRENCH CONNECTION a memorable flick. Also starring are: Fernando Rey, Tony Lo Bianco, Harold Gray, Arlene Farber and Frederic de Pasquale.",The French Connection
16,sunwarrior13,An Action Film Classic,10,7 November 2016,"Gene Hackman and Roy Schneider star in this action drama thriller about the life of two New York City policemen that hunt down drug dealers based on the non-fiction novel written by Robin Moore entitled The French Connection.This was based on the real lives of Narcotics Detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso. William Friedkin directed this 70's film that won five Academy Awards.Alain Charnier is a French drug kingpin who distributes a big percentage of drugs in New York City.He's got a hired killer and a right-hand man in Nicoli. New York City detectives, Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle and Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo starts to do their investigation by putting a surveillance on Sal Boca and his wife,Angie,who are living extravagantly despite having a corner store that does not earn that much.Later,they found out that the couple do work for Charnier,who smuggles $32 million worth of heroin from France into the city.Both Popeye and Cloudy try to put a stop to these illegal acts to put a stop into the drug problem of New York.This definitely deserves the highest rating of 10/10. Despite the movie being more than 40 years since it was initially released, we get to see that the issue of narcotics remain a big problem in the country today.The process of putting a stop to Charnier was definitely told with lots of gritty realism.Aside from that,we also get to see interesting characters who are the good guys of the film with a lot of character flaws.It was definitely unusual back in the 70's to see heroes like Popeye to be violent,racist and having a mean- spirit.Aside from that,it was definitely full of violent scenes that would still excite many viewers of today.And what about the ending?That was really something considering we see the drug kingpin escape from the detectives to the bitterness of Popeye.No question that the performances of the film are worthy of an Academy Award especially Gene Hackman as Popeye and it deserves the Oscar for Best Picture in 1972 for the story was told in a fast-paced and the chase sequences were definitely explosive and full of suspense.",The French Connection

18,Theo Robertson,Gritty And Hard Hitting At The Time ...,7,18 January 2005,"... But perhaps a little bit dated now This must have shocked audiences at the time . Anti hero cop Popeye Doyle doesn't bend rules because he doesn't understand the concept of rules , catching scumbags is all that matters and if that means beating information out of a small time scumbag so be it . Hackman is really intense in the role and you feel glad that Popeye decided to join the force instead of turning to crime himself . This movie reaches new heights of social realism via Friedkin's directing , it's filmed almost as a documentary with hand held cameras and abrasive jump cuts to other locations . Like I said this must have shocked audiences...... but only in the 70s . That's the problem with watching THE FRENCH CONNECTION more than 30 years after it was made - we've seen too many similar things in the intervening period . Every cop show as a sort of fascist good guy who would happily torture confessions out of suspects who are always invaribly guilty . When a snitch gives information to Detective Fascist he must be ruffed up a little to keep his cover going . when pursuing a villain Detective Fascist must pursue him in a vast car narrowly missing passers by etc etc . Name every cop show or detective movie and they all have the same type of story That's the main fault of THE FRENCH CONNECTION - it's let far too many genies out of too many bottles , it's been imitated ( Usually in a far inferior manner ) a myriad of times that it seems almost run of the mill now . But despite the familiar subject matter it's still a very effective and hard hitting thriller mainly down to the director and star . I wish I'd seen it in the early 1970s when it seemed like radical film making",The French Connection

In a sneaky trick, Charnier suckers a struggling actor, Henri Devereaux(Frédéric de Pasquale)into smuggling the heroine load in his car into New York. The film shows the extremely hard work Popeye and Buddy put in taking down this big operation. Yet, despite all the intense hard work and constant running around the city, Popeye sees the one he really wants, Chanier, slipping through his fingers.Powerful acting from Hackman with fine support by Scheider as his partner. Known, ad nauseum, for the car chase as Popeye drives through traffic(..and almost through innocent people, like a woman pushing a baby carriage)to catch up with Charnier's right-hand assassin who almost sniper-kills him from a rooftop. The assassin takes over a subway car which Popeye must catch up to if he will not let the killer get away without paying for the death of an innocent woman standing in the way of a bullet meant for him. The location work in NYC gives the film a terrific authenticity that goes well with the narcotics sting taking place within.",The French Connection
20,Hey_Sweden,Fast and convincing.,10,18 September 2015,"If he hadn't made anything else, filmmaker William Friedkin still would have had the distinction of having made ""The Exorcist"", one of the finest horror films ever made (although he doesn't think of it as such), and this film, one of the finest in the cop / crime genre. I saw one review actually accuse it of being slow, when in fact, I thought it had a definite urgency to it, personified in the incredible tenacity of its main character, Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle. It's as gritty and authentic as this sort of thing gets, with the audience swept along as our investigating detectives go on their intense manhunts.Based on the real-life exploits of narcotics detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso (who are technical consultants and also have small roles in the film), ""The French Connection"" follows Doyle (Oscar winning Gene Hackman) and his partner Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo (Oscar nominated Roy Scheider) as they bust any and every perp they find dealing dope. The two of them start to tail a small time store owner, Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) who associates with criminal types, and get wind of a major drug smuggling operation being engineered by smooth, dapper Frenchman Alain Charnier (charismatic Fernando Rey).Even the opening credits are done with in a hurry, accompanied by the thunderous music of Don Ellis. From then on, the film doesn't waste a minute, with no unnecessary subplots to slow down the action. It also helped to usher in the popularity of the ""good cop, bad cop"" routine developed by Egan and Grosso. Owen Roizmans' excellent cinematography perfectly stresses the realism of the NYC streets. The violence is effective without ever being excessive.Hackman tears into the scenery as Doyle, a tough, hard driving, mulish s.o.b. who doesn't really try to endear himself to anybody. Scheider matches him as the slightly more low key Russo. Rey, Lo Bianco, Marcel Bozzuffi as Pierre Nicoli, Frederic de Pasquale as unwitting French acting star Monsieur Devereaux, and Arlene Farber as Sals' wife Angie comprise an engaging supporting cast.That brings us to one of the most gripping chase scenes ever constructed for a feature film, as Doyle relentlessly pursues a would-be sniper. Kudos to the editor, Jerry Greenberg, for keeping the action so taut.It's easy to see why some cinema lovers would hold this particular production in high regard.This was the first R rated film to win the Oscar for best picture; Friedkin, Greenberg, and screenwriter Ernest Tidyman all picked up statues as well.10 out of 10.",The French Connection

22,zardoz-13,Gritty Police Thriller,10,26 January 2012,"Popeye Doyle is nothing like Dirty Harry. Popeye Doyle is a rude, crude, and ugly looking cop who doesn't believe in political correctness. The philosophy that Popeye espouses is never trust anybody. The milk of human kindness doesn't course through his veins. He is the kind of cop who believes that the ends justify the means and if somebody gets killed in the line of duty, tough stuff! Gene Hackman embodied a different breed of cop. Nothing about Popeye Doyle is sympathetic. He is an opportunistic. When you see a cop like Popeye, he is typically a villain. Director William Friedkin's ""The French Connection"" qualifies as a different kind of police procedural thriller. These cops are bloodhounds who make mistakes, but they never let their flaws get in their way. Indeed, the police in ""The French Connection"" are their own worst enemy. You know that you are watching a different kind of police movie when the villain--a suave Frenchman--outsmarts them at virtually every turn. The action takes place in New York City in 1971 with Popeye Doyle and his partner Cloudy (Roy Scheider)going after the mother of all drug busts. Frenchman Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey of ""Companeros"")conceals 60 kilos of heroin in the rocker panels of an LTD and ships it to New York City. The man whose name the car is registered in is a French television star Devereaux (Frederic De Pasquale of ""Blood in the Streets"") who needs the money and treats the visit as a location tour for a TV show. An African-American informant warns Popeye that the junkies are eagerly awaiting a new shipment of junk. Our anti-heroes keep tabs on a suspicious character, Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco of ""Nixon""), who is seen in the company of a big-time drug dealer, Weinstock (Harold Gary of ""Murder, Inc.""),who Popeye knows is dirty. Popeye's superior Simonson (Eddie Egan of ""Prime Cut"")reluctantly lets Popeye follow his hunch and gives him two wire-taps. When Charnier shows up in America, his murderous bodyguard Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi of ""March or Die"") accompanies him. Nicoli is the kind of killer who shoots first and asks questions later. He thinks that he is pretty tough until he tangles with Popeye. This is one exciting, hell- bent-for-leather actioneer with profane language galore and realistic, on-the-streets photography.",The French Connection
23,grantss,Good but not great,6,31 January 2017,"New York police detectives Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle and Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo are staking out a suspected drug transaction. When it goes down they capture one of the dealers who reveals a connection to a large French drug cartel, run by Alain Charnier. What follows is a dangerous game of cat and mouse.Good but not great. A fairly conventional detective drama. Quite gritty, but there is a large element of style over substance, especially massive chase scenes and protracted shootouts. I actually prefer the sequel, The French Connection II (and sequels being better than the original is an incredible rarity, especially for me). Decent performances though. Gene Hackman won a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Popeye Doyle and Roy Scheider got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Cloudy Russo.The movie itself won the 1972 Best Picture Oscar.",The French Connection
24,Boba_Fett1138,The ultimate cop movie.,10,5 February 2005,"My favorite movie of all time ""A Clockwork Orange"" lost at the best picture Acadamy Award ceremony against this movie. However looking at this movie I can't say that it's undeserved, for ""The French Connection"" truly is one of the best movies from at least the seventies and maybe of all time. It most certainly is the best cop movie ever made, in my opinion!The movie has a perfect gritty and realistic kind of atmosphere and an unmistakably seventies feeling. I love it! The seventies truly were the golden age of film making and they simply don't make movies like this anymore.The characters are perfectly realistic and director William Friedkin and the actors most certainly don't attempt to portray them as being heroic or 'good cops'. Gene Hackman really in a way is an anti-hero and he seems to be born to play 'Popeye' Doyle, who by now truly has grown into a classic movie character. Roy Scheider also is really great as his partner 'Cloudy' Russo, even though his character at times disappears too long out of the story. A shame because he and Hackman were a perfect screen duo. Both got an Oscar nomination but only Hackman got to take the statue home with him. The movie also won Oscar's for best director, best film editing, best picture and best writing, screenplay based on material from another medium and got nominated for three more.The movie might have a slow pace by today's standards but the wonderful story and acting really make up for this, ""The French Connection"" has stand the test of time well. The slow pace even makes the famous car chase scene even more energetic and thrilling enough to make your adrenaline run.Truly in my opinion, the ultimate cop movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The French Connection
25,view_and_review,Disconnection,5,8 April 2019,"An unkempt, crusty detective given to using racial epithets thinks he's on to a big drug bust. That would be a real win for him and his partner considering they spend most of their time rustling up street level users and dealers in black neighborhoods. Their hunch proves to be worthwhile but they have to now be clever and precise in their bust tactics: two qualities they both lack.There was nothing truly redeeming about Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider). Buddy was bearable whereas Jimmy was not. He was the prototypical shoot-from-the-hip cop that followed no real guidelines. He was the law and that was enough to rough up ""suspects"", profile ""n***ers"" and ""greasers,"" and commandeer vehicles. If you like that type of policing then he was fantastic. If you are appalled by that type of policing then Jimmy Doyle was everything you hate to see in an officer of the law.",The French Connection
26,evanston_dad,"A Movie About Popeye --- No, Not THAT Popeye",7,9 April 2007,"A movie that's most remembered for a complex and dazzling car chase scene through the streets of New York City, ""The French Connection"" wowed audiences and critics at the time and set the mold for the gritty police crime drama that still exists today in our movie theatres and on our television screens. The jittery, documentary-style cinematography and the grungy production design are the elements still aped today by T.V. shows that want to consider themselves to be ""realistic."" But the film is really nothing more than an exciting popcorn film; there would be nothing wrong with that if cinephiles hadn't exalted it beyond its rightful place in film history and led many modern-day viewers coming to it for the first time to expect something extraordinary.Also notable for making a star out of Gene Hackman, who indeed is one of the film's biggest assets in the role of Popeye Doyle, tough-guy detective who's almost as bad as the bad guys he's out to protect the public from. But Roy Scheider, in the supporting role of Popeye's sidekick, is equally deserving of praise.""The Departed"" owes much to ""The French Connection,"" as its screenplay explores the same kind of corruption that blurs the boundaries between upholding the law and breaking it. In Scorsese's film, as in ""The French Connection,"" you don't know whether it's better to be on the side of the law or opposed to it; both positions seem equally scary.Grade: B+",The French Connection

Buddy (Roy ""Jaws"" Scheider) expresses some skepticism in his facial expression - and that is something that should be shown in any acting masterclass. Most impressive for sure.

29,trashgang,classic indeed,8,17 March 2015,"Grown up in the seventies and eighties I remember this flick well because my dad loved to see flicks with Gene Hackman. Nowadays those flicks are out on Blu Ray and sometimes it's worth picking up like this one. The Blu ray itself isn't that great, you can see the conversion towards Hi-Def but don't be bothered this flick made by Friedkin is still delivering even as is the story not that big. But what makes it great are the acting performances itself and to see New YOrk early seventies with in the background the constructions of WTC and the filth of New York itself before it was cleaned at the early nineties. Even as it isn't that strong on script it still gives enough suspense because you just want to know if a low life cop as Popeye (Hackman) can tear down a French connection. What did made it a classic is the chase between a car and a train from New York Subway system. Even for a flick that old it still stood the time full of excellent performances and excellent camera POV's. If you're into flicks about the mob or wanna see the acting of the seventies then this is it. Classic indeed.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Story 3/5 Effects 0/5 Comedy 0/5",The French Connection
30,SimonJack,The gritty underworld of drugs and trafficking,8,8 January 2017,"""The French Connection"" is a gritty, harsh film that looks at the underworld of drug dealing and efforts of the law to bring down the big narcotics dealers. This is an intense film that tries to show the real world of the drug scene in New York City. The R rating is serious, and many adults may find this film unsettling. It is a good film as a study of the subject, based on a book about two real New York police detectives in the 1960s. But it clearly is not entertainment. The screenplay has been fictionalized. The performances across the board are excellent. This film won five Oscars, including four of the five top honors. It won best picture for 1972, and William Freiedkin won as best director. Gene Hackman walked away with the best actor Oscar and Ernest Tidyman scored for the best writing of a screenplay based on another source. Only the best actress of the top five awards was missing – and that because there wasn't a major female role in the film. ""The French Connection"" also was the first R-rated movie, since the MPAA ratings began in November 1968, to win a best picture Oscar. As of this writing (January 2017), every best picture Oscar winner—except one, since 2004 has been an R-rated film. ""The French Connection"" also ushered in an era of new crime films. They deal more with the gritty, seedy and often crude operations involving the underworld and law and order. Some quick ones on the heels of this film were ""The Godfather"" in 1972, ""Serpico"" in 1973,"" The French Connection II"" in 1975, and on through ""Scarface"" of 1983 and to the present day.These are far from family films, and many adults may not like them. I don't know that one would consider this film entertainment, but it is interesting. I watch such films occasionally because they show a side of a real world that most people don't otherwise see or know. They are disturbing, and that should be a good sign for viewers who don't want such a culture to flourish.",The French Connection
31,Mr-Fusion,Hard as nails,7,26 April 2015,"""The French Connection"" is the sort of movie that lets the intensity slowly mount until you can't look away. As a cop movie, this is as gritty as they come; an urban stroll through New York City - from the upper crust to seedy Brooklyn. Hackman's something to see here, a shark preying through murky waters. But the main reason this movie is so gripping is the editing. This baby movies, even when no shots are fired and they're just tailing a guy through high-end stores. There's a bristling energy to all of it, right up until that bleak ending.And then there's that car chase. Time has done nothing to its potency. It seems to fit right in with the ragged tone of the rest of the movie and it's still, to this day, guaranteed to please.7/10",The French Connection

34,Smells_Like_Cheese,A gritty hard cop drama that is surprisingly effective,8,18 July 2007,"I have heard so much about The French Connection, in my film class a couple years ago, we watched the exciting car chase scene that made this movie so famous. I just thought of the film again and decided to rent it. I watched it this morning and I have to say that William Friedkin is definitely a terrific director, he caught the mood and setting of 1970's New York and crime perfectly, so it wasn't a shock to learn that this was the 1971 best picture. This is a definite treasure when it comes to film history and is very memorable.Doyle and Russo are cop partners, it's very strange how opposite they are. Russo is pretty straight by the book and clean while Doyle is a grumpy alcoholic but does get his job done. Together they are about to stop the crime of the decade when they find out about a drug smuggle coming from France. Going through so many people to find out what will happen and when, they go through the most extreme times to bust the case.Well, The French Connection is a terrific film that is a must see for film fanatics. Or if you are just looking for a good movie to watch, this was a great one from the 70's. The car chase scene was very excellent, I think not too many people give this movie enough credit on how it was shot and made. William and the cast were just terrific, The French Connection was a very cool film.8/10",The French Connection
35,blanbrn,Entertaining and action packed. Well done a tough and gritty memorable performance from Gene Hackman.,8,24 August 2007,"""The French Connection"" maybe isn't the best movie of 1971(hint: ""A Clockwork Orange"") yet it still packs a very intense and entertaining punch of action and high suspense drama. Director William Friedkin really did a great job shaping and directing this film for it's action packed entertainment and for the way he introduced the public to America's street drug scene which was a little ahead of it's time, before the big 80's illegal drug boom. You as the viewer feel entertained and interested all during the film so it probably deserved to win best picture of 1971, yet it's ending is somewhat disappointing it didn't really give any closure or justice in my opinion, I guess that's the way Friedkin wanted it to end though. Set in New York City you have Gene Hackman as a veteran and tough gritty detective ""Popeye Doyle"" who works great along side his partner Buddy Russo(Roy Scheider), and I must say great performance from Gene he was really into this role very intense and tough well deserving of his best actor Oscar. Upon policing the bad streets they uncover that the city drug world is connected internationally and it's sends them on a pursuit outside the Big Apple as they find a narcotics smuggling ring connected to France. All in all the movie is entertaining and intense really a good open flood gate movie of the 70's for it's ahead of time take on the introduction to the street drug culture, and well liked for it's good guys against bad guys theme and most memorable is the car chase scene while an up above subway travels thru the city. Overall one of the better movies made even though in my opinion the ending didn't give enough justice closure the entertainment and heart pumping action made it a winner.",The French Connection

38,sddavis63,Pretty Good Drug Smuggling Story With A Somewhat Anti-Climactic Ending,6,13 February 2010,"Be prepared! This movie will be most entertaining for those who like to watch extended scenes of police surveillance - in other words, people who like to watch people watching people will love this. Probably 75% of this movie revolves around police surveillance or various chases. That's not particularly a criticism - just know that it's a primary focus of the movie when you go in; it's not the now typical action-adventure type of movie. The surveillance is portrayed rather well, and it does lead to a gradual but deliberate buildup of the story, which revolves around a major shipment of drugs coming into New York City from France, and the efforts of a couple of NYPD detectives to stop it.Gene Hackman won an Oscar as Best Lead Actor for his portrayal of Det. Popeye Doyle - and he was deserving. He was first-rate as a totally obsessed cop who's out to get the bad guys at whatever cost. His obsession probably reaches its climax (as does the movie as a whole in many ways) with the wild car chase scene, as Popeye commandeers a civilian's car to chase a train carrying a sniper who had tried to kill him. It's obvious in that chase that Popeye has no regard for his own safety - or for anyone else's on the road, so obsessed is he with catching this guy. That chase scene was exciting. The movie as a whole isn't particularly exciting, although it does provide a fascinating look at the methods of both the drug smugglers and the cops trying to stop them.The movie is ""based on"" real events and real people, although all the names have been changed. My biggest criticism of the movie is the last scene. This seemed to be building up to a truly climactic resolution; instead, I found the ending to be a classic example of anti-climax, as it just seems to come to an end at a point that didn't make much sense as the ending, with the viewer suddenly being told in script what happened to all the main characters (which was a bit misleading, since the characters in this movie were only ""based on"" actual people.)

At least during the chase the film feels alive for a while, but then it collapses again.

What makes this movie so effective is the realistic acting as policemen by Hackman and Roy Scheider, Det. Russo, and the gritty and grimy NYC locations. That makes the film look more like a documentary on city crime instead a movie about city crime. Most of the movie is made up of tailing the drug dealers through the city to get a handle of just what their up to and where they plan to unload the drugs that they had smuggled into the city for distribution. The acting and direction is so good that its almost as effective, like the cat and mouse game between Popeye and the top drug smuggler Charnier (Fernando Rey) at the 42nd St. subway shuttle, as the incredible car vrs train chase scene that came much later in the movie.The best thing about the French Connection"" if anything in the movie could top what we saw up to that point is that the ending didn't cop-out but left the viewers thinking that there are no happy endings when it comes to the never ending saga of cops and robbers, or in this case drug dealers. Also effective is the rivalry between the NYC police and the Federal agents who were assigned to the case and how the clash of personalities almost jeopardized the whole drug busting operation.Bill Hickman, Bill Muldering, who was the top federal agent assigned to the case was the driver in the famous car chase under the El-train in the movie ""The French Connection"".

41,Lejink,In France They Kill On Main Street,8,23 July 2021,"Terrific, gritty police-procedural drama which probably proved to be a career high for director Friedkin and star Gene Hackman. The film has a kinetic energy which drives it from start to finish, from the first explosive murder of an undercover cop in Marseilles to the final showdown on New York's dockside.It features one of the great chases, with Hackman's Popeye Doyle commandeering a civilian car to make like Superman by racing a speeding train across New York, but my own favourite moment will always be drugs overlord Fernando Rey's kiss-off to Hackman after they've done their on-again, off-again dance boarding an earlier train, neatly reciprocated when Doyle finally catches up with him again at the end.Friedkin makes great use of the less salubrious locations of downtown New York, accentuating the action with hand-held camera shots and dynamic cross-cutting but the film would be nothing without the quality of the lead acting. There's a wonderful contrast between the edgy, naturalistic acting of the slummy Hackman and Roy Scheider as his side-kick Russo, with the suave, urbane, much quieter style of revered Spanish star Rey. Hackman won the Oscar but it's Rey, who in my book, steals the picture.For me the film is let down by one or two ""of-their-time"" racist and sexist overtones and I didn't like the end-titles epilogue which I thought unnecessary. But otherwise this is as exciting and in-your-face a cop drama as you could get, standing on the shoulders of the likes of ""In The Heat Of The Night"" and ""Bullitt"", but really taking the genre to a different, altogether higher level.i.",The French Connection
42,ElMaruecan82,"""The Godfather"" of Cop Movies ...",10,19 March 2011,"No other thriller has ever matched the quality and originality of ""The French Connection"", one of the most heart-pounding realistic cop movies that ever enriched the silver screen. Only in the early 70's, such a masterpiece could have been made, at the creative pinnacle of Hollywood's New Wave that brought a new fresh air in American cinema, an air made of politically incorrect excitement and gripping realism. A masterpiece of realism indeed, whose heart and soul rely on one of the most unforgettable cinematic antiheroes, Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, superbly played by Gene Hackman.It's not even a performance, Gene Hackman is simply natural as Doyle, aka ""Popeye"", he embodies the rousing realism of the film which thanks to William Friedkin's accurate and methodic directing, makes it the equivalent of Zola's naturalism in literature. This naturalism gives an incredible documentary feeling that strangely provided better thrills than an exaggerated cinematic dramatization. The protagonists in this film are New York City cops from the Narcotic Bureau, but they're also friends and colleagues, making crude jokes, drinking, eating, and interacting more than acting. They're not even characters since everything feels so real only one fear kept my mind a little anxious: that at one point, something ruins this desensitized boldness. Thankfully, it didn't and from beginning to end, ""The French Connection"" combined the excitement of a cat-and-mouse thriller and the realism of a fascinating character study.These two elements are the fundamentals on which relies the excitement, working in total complementarity: never there is a moment in the film where it tries to focus only on ""Popeye"", or where the chase doesn't highlight a new aspect of his personality. Everything goes so fast anyway, there's not enough time to focus on other characters, they're not underdeveloped but ""The French Connection"" IS Doyle. His strong feeling that there's a foreign drug smuggling operation going on, confirmed with the scenes featuring the French antagonists, is a proof that he's got the competence AND the instinct. We know he's not just charismatic, he's also right.And the chase that starts at the bottom of the gang (when from a simple intuition, they followed Sal Boca) has the suspenseful excitement of a chess game, where we just wait for the moment they'll finally meet the King, the mastermind, Alain Charnier aka Frog One, in a great performance, all in nuance, by Bunuel's fetish actor: Fernando Rey. Indeed, it's like a chess game where the King is protected by the 'bishop', Pierre Nicoli, the hit-man, the real villain of the film, whose killing becomes almost a subplot. A subplot that will contribute to one of the most thrilling car chases ever . And whenever I watch this sequence, I realize how this must have been an excitement at the time of its release, in the theaters. There's something almost personal in that chase, driven by the first killing of the mother with the baby carriage, starting with a shocking death to end on a more satisfying one, the iconic killing in the stairs. The hit-man looks so helpless; it's like a cold-blooded murder. But we're definitely on ""Popeye's"" side at this point, and the case became personal.This empathy to ""Popeye"" is driven by the character study which makes us follow step by step (in the true meaning of the word) his investigation. We see him efficiently handling an interrogatory with his classic ""Have you ever picked your feet in Poughkeepsie?"", harassing the drug smugglers in an almost entertaining way, with his inseparable pork-pie hat, getting news from his informer etc. He's just so dedicated and competent in his job that his private life, in contrast, is less appealing, totally diluted in sex rides with one-shot girls met in the corner of a street or accidental sleeping in a bar  Only, in the exercise of his duty, ""Popeye"" is like a fish in water, charismatic, powerful, outside he's no better than the people he chases. There's even a strange contrast between him and Charnier, sophisticated, distinguished ... here is a sleazy cop against big shots. When Charnier and the hit-man are in a restaurant, savoring a good wine, a delicious food and a tasty dessert, ""Popeye"" freezes his ass waiting for his partner Russo to bring him a slice of pizza, honorable mention to the late Roy Sheider in a great supporting performance.

He's the Michael Corleone of the film and like him, his dedication to his duty will ultimately alienate him.""Popeye's"" alienation is foreseen in the early scenes, where he's so convinced he's right, we share his perseverance, as we share his frustration when he loses the track of Charnier, waving bye-bye to him, in the memorable subway scene. We want him to shut the mouth of his colleague who can't stop reminding him that he already screwed up before, but we're so with ""Popeye"" that we never suspect that he could fail, we want him to get the baddies and the scene of the car crash reminds us that drug is no play or no fun. He's the law, he's here to protect the good citizens, he must win. That's why we share of course, his satisfaction where he owns Charnier, by waving back to him in the memorable climax. And after the shootout, where the game seems over, the last minute of the film leaves us stunned, wondering is this the guy we cheered for. ""Popeye"" screwed again, victim of his persistence, of himself, killing the very colleague who warned him  A shocking ending incarnated by the last scary gunshot, which makes Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, one of the most unforgettable cinematic antiheroes, and ""The French Connection"" a milestone never equaled",The French Connection
43,paul2001sw-1,Connected to greatness,10,7 September 2003,"Ignore the claims made for the over-hyped ""Exorcist"" - ""The French Connection"" is director Friedkin's masterpiece.  So much about this film is just so good - the dirtiest, grimiest ever depiction of New York City; the fast-moving camera work that seems decades ahead of its time; the horrid but effective score; and the pitch-perfect performance from Gene Hackman (would he even get cast in today's beauty-obsessed age?).  But best of all is Friedkin's total control of plot and purpose.  The movie starts slowly, all suspense and little action, but the attention paid to humdrum detail pays off, in that when the story finally explodes (with that famous car chase scene, as imaginative as it is scary), you believe in what you are seeing. The film then suckers its audience for a while, giving the impression of a conventional, albeit highly superior, thriller - but the shocking, uncompromising ending asks all the questions that other films about flawed heroes almost always duck.  It spawned a whole gene of more or less pale imitators; but thirty-two years on, it still stands alone, definitive and best.",The French Connection

It's murky but in an exciting way though the excitement isn't pleasurable.  (It's like a fairground ride that churns you up inside and makes you feel queasy rather than elated and it's got a car-chase that is like the best fair ground ride imaginable. Gene Hackman brings a character actor's charisma to the part of Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, the good/bad policeman who will stop at nothing to get his man.  Hackman is one of the best actors the movies has and his performance here has become legendary and he won the Best Actor Oscar for it but at times he seems to throw away his lines and there are no shadings to the character.  (He was better in the John Frankenhimer directed sequel). Fernando Rey is the principal bad guy and he's wonderfully suave in the way Rey always seemed to be.  There is an urbanity to his performance that seems to belong to a different film.

Its car-chase sequence is a real stand-out, too, not only within the genre but also the whole medium. Its devastatingly dangerous feel is afforded simply because it was shot straight-up for real, every bump, scrape and oh-so-close call just seconds away from ending not only the careers of every member of the cast and crew but also Gene Hackman's and several regular city-slickers' very lives. While this reckless abandon cannot be advised or even condoned, it certainly adds to the utter determination and desperation of one of the most no-holds-barred, brash and brutally honest action scenes of the seventies. Still, it's actually the film's quieter moments that strike me the most; Roy Schneider slowly stalking someone from behind a broadsheet or tenuously tailing the last in a long line of fruitless endeavours. These moments somehow manage to keep me riveted despite their lack of action, showing an ironically interesting side of a slow-burning and sometimes boring job, a side seldom seen in cinema. 7/10.",The French Connection
46,gbill-74877,Great drama,9,8 February 2019,"Highlights:The ending, my god. Plus a half tick in my rating for that.The street scenes. The film absolutely immerses us in 1971 New York, and director William Friedkin effortlessly blends well-framed shots with those that show us seamy street life as it is.The tension in those chase scenes. The pace of the film is great, showing patience in long stakeouts but gradually working its way up to a crescendo during the pursuits. The cat and mouse game in the subway is fantastic, as is the car chase following the elevated train.Great storytelling. The plot is tight and while we may not always believe some of the events, they're credible and there aren't giant plot holes or irrelevant subplots. The criminals are pretty clever too, and the car teardown searching for where the drugs might be was great.The nuance in the lead detective (Gene Hackman). He initially comes across as an idealized view of the gritty, macho cop, even though he's got some serious issues (see lowlights). However, as it plays out, he's not idolized as characters like Dirty Harry, and is instead shown as being as obsessed and out of control as Captain Ahab, and in a subtle, smart way by Friedkin.Hey, isn't it nice that the country the drugs are coming in from, what a moron might call a s***hole country, is France? Apparently that's where most of the Heroin came into America from at the time, and there's a lesson in there somewhere.Lowlights:The treatment of African-Americans. Hackman is toxic towards them early on, quipping ""never trust a n*****,"" and also aggressively shaking them down. His partner (Roy Scheider) points out in the first instance that the person he's talking about could have been white, but none of this part of what he does is truly challenged. We can say this is what makes Hackman a real person and an anti-hero, but unfortunately I think filmgoers probably saw this as part of the positive side of him.I also get the 'get tough on crime' vibe from this film, and shudder a little over the direction this would take the country in over the following decades. 'Dirty Harry' was made in the same year, and both films show the frustrations Americans had with drug use and violent crime in cities, so part of it understandable. The overreaction that this film advocates, though in a more indirect way, seems to be police brutality and much stiffer sentences, both of which would balloon into real problems in the decades which followed.",The French Connection

But back in the day of this film's release, this was something new. Audiences haven't seen crime films to this extent and this film features one of the best car chases in movie history. Despite seeing many similar films, I watched this movie as if they didn't exist yet and I really enjoyed the film. It hasn't aged well, but the acting and the story makes up for that.William Friedkin's film is about a detective, Doyle and his partner who get involved with trying to foil a narcotics ring. But nothing turns out the way it should be and they go all out to bring the criminals to justice.Gene Hackman is a very fine actor and I never see him as an action star, but he did a great job and is the perfect Doyle. Roy Scheider, before his iconic role in Jaws, is also pretty good as Doyle's partner.Overall, this is a good 1970's film that features a very good, long car chase within the streets of New York City. There were some legit surprises in the film that I'm sure was unusual for the time period. This plot may seem generic today, but not back then. In fact, the way the movie was written and acted, this film would have still been good if made today. I rate this film 8/10.",The French Connection

But prior to that, this was the movie that defined his career. It was the New Hollywood answer to film noir, and the lead male (Gene Hackman) is presented without glamour, the gritty city (New York) without dramatic shadows and light, and the plot (about modern drug dealing) without hyped up dramatics. This is a movie as down in the mouth as the world it represents, and it's all deliberate, and smart.This is the stuff of a breakthrough movie. It isn't quite as gripping now, I think, but it still sucks you in. There are lots of scenes in cars, including the famous car chase, and lots of good old street stuff in Manhattan, very 1970 (when it was shot). The plot and pace of things is more steady than exciting, usually, not cinema verite but a kind of camera work that is unglamorous with the idea that this really is the way it is, and it works great. It would have been easy to push this farther and make it truly boring, but it doesn't go there. Instead we see the details of a couple of cops out to break a huge dope ring.Most of the movie (I'm going to guess three quarters) is simply the cops trailing the bad guys, on foot or by car. There are very brief interspersed personal dramas, and there are conversations that keep the plot clear, but the overall big vector here is one direction, and the cops get closer in spurts and jerks to their prey. The velocity does increase gradually in the second half, with a kind of brilliant building to a finale, and by the end it's a thrilling climax. In a way, this kind of film is the exact opposite of something like ""Die Hard,"" which is all exaggeration and excess. And if those other kinds of movies are more fun, this is not only edgy, it's pertinent. And the music is by jazz great Don Ellis.

His partner, Buddy (Roy Scheider) tries valiantly to keep his colleague's worst impulses under control and generally succeeds. At this time, there is a new enemy in town, as a French drug lord has hatched a plot to bring an especially pure strain of heroin to town and he is meeting with a rising star in American drug mobsters. Catching news of this plot, Popeye and Buddy follow the French bigwig everywhere and try to find out the circumstances for the exchange of drugs and money. This is complicated by the fact that there is a hitman who works for the Frenchman also on the loose. Can two erstwhile and clever detectives bring down the suave, cool Frog? First, the look of the film surprised this viewer. Friedkin the director has definitely used a minimalist approach on the sets and concentrated more on the plot. Then, too, viewers must pay attention to the dialogue as nothing is spelled out in narration or any other way so that the actors words are paramount to understanding the plot, which is complicated. Nevertheless, there are many thrills which make this a top-rated film. One is Hackman's performance, which is superb. No, he's not really likeable but his manic devotion to catching criminals has an energy that makes every viewer's heart pound. One very funny scene involves Popeye being handcuffed to a bed by a one-night stand and Buddy having to rescue him. Scheider is also fine as the low key co-detective. All the supporting cast is great as well. Most importantly, the chase all over the city and its burbs is thrilling. This is especially so for Popeye's high octane drive on the road underneath the subway tracks, trying to catch the hitman who has boarded the train. It's breaktaking. There is a bit of blood and gore but not much and no one should stay away for fear of too much violence. In short, connect with the French Connection, do, do, do!",The French Connection

52,sol-,The Chase,6,18 January 2017,"Two American police officers try to track a shipment of drugs from France in this iconic crime thriller directed by William Friedkin and starring Gene Hackman. The film was a big box office success in its day, showcasing chase sequences as rarely seen before, and with frequently mobile cinematography from Owen Roizman, including well- used hand-held shots, the film is definitely technically adept. Indeed, at the best of times, 'The French Connection' is a thrilling ride, but unfortunately this is not very often - and a second viewing does little to improve things. All of the chase sequences are certainly exciting (and one where Fernando Rey gets on and off a train repeatedly is even quite funny), however, the pacing of the film slows down to a near halt in between the action scenes. The story is fairly decent, involving police surveillance and on-the-spot ingenuity, however, the characters are never particularly likable, or even fleshed out in any depth beyond being painted as relentless cops, and Hackman's Best Actor Oscar win remains one of the oddest of all time (the film also inexplicably won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay over 'The Last Picture Show' that year). Simply put, without characters that are remarkable or interesting to follow around, the film falls rather flat in its non-action scenes. Fortunately, there is a lot of action here, including foot as well as car chases, but given how many other films about hardened cops have come out in the years since, it is challenging to fathom just how popular this film was in its day.",The French Connection

It could even be called unfair and dishonest criticism, originating mainly from the Political Far Left, the Left-leaning Press and Electronic Media and what has been called, ""Useful Idiots""(a lot of those!) Running against the trend, swimming up stream if you will, was the need on the part of the public to read the tough, gritty Police Detective Novel or to view Movies about the hard boiled, tough guy Cop*, the guy who will not accept defeat at the hands of any thug, be he a small timer or some Big Shot ""Made Man"" from some Organized Crime Syndicate Operation.So during this period we saw the emergence of such brutally realistic examples of this Genre of Film. Consequently the ensuing years found the release of the following ""Tough Guy Cop"" Films: DIRTY HARRY(Clint Eastwood,1971), McQ(John Wayne, 1974), THE TAKE(Billy Dee Williams, 1974)and BRANNIGAN(The 'Duke"" again, 1975).The major work of its kind, in its day was THE FRENCH CONNECTION (1971);and it is easy to see why.This story of a pair of New York City Police Detectives assigned to the Narcotics Division. Like so many regular partners on the job, they have become very close personally. We are shown them out on an ordinary, run of the mill, small potatoes type Street Drug Bust.Later, quite by accident, while stopping at the local 'Watering Hole', Doyle(Gene Hackman)gets suspicions about the gathering of people at one of the tables. Recognizing some low level career criminals present and the passing of cash between patrons seated together. After pointing out this his partner,Detective Buddy Russo(Roy Sheider)he talks them into putting a tail on the young Couple,Sal & Angie Bocca(Tony LoBianco/Arlene Faber).The investigation snowballs, and before long Suspected Big Time Narcotics Man,Joel Weinstock(Harold Gray) is linked to them. Court Ordered Wiretaps link some foreign sounding guys.Once again, the scope and size of the investigation occurs, only this time their Lieutennant Simonson(Eddie Egan, the ""Real Popeye"") informs them that he has brought in the ""G"". Because of the magnitude of the surveillance, the man-power needed and the cost factor, Federal Narcotics Agents are assigned to work the case with them. Over their objections the 2 Feds, Agents Muldering(Bill Hickman)and Klein(Sonny Grosso)**are added to the team.What follows is a very realistic glimpse into the countless hours of seeming inactivity. This is truly the non-glamorous,tedious work days of long hours and little really good rest time.We are also privy to a brush with a NYC Street Gang, the use of a professional Assassin, multi killings of innocent by-standing citizens, a hijacked ""El""Train, the killing of Transit Cop and Conductor and a generally top action, intelligently constructed story.Oh yeah, I almost forgot. This motion picture, THE FRENCH CONNECTION has in it just about the most lengthy and exciting of a chase scene with automobile that you'll ever seen in any movie, any time. And remember, while it was filmed over several days and masterfully edited down to this present, extremely exciting form, no Computer Tricks/Animations/Green Screen processes were employed! And the whole story is enhanced in mood and total effect by the musical score. The offbeat music is both attention getting and ominous. This style as exhibited by composer,Don Ellis, is especially effective in the beginning, where it is paired with the visually loud, quick moving titles.NOTE: * There was some objection raised by certain critics and news pundits criticizing the Author of the Screenplay and the dialog, for being too crude. Yeah it was loud and dirty on times. And as to the use of Derogatory Slang terms relating to various Racial/Ethnic groups, we can only say, GET USED TO IT!

54,zkonedog,"Only For Hard-Boiled, Gritty Cop Drama Enthusiasts",4,29 April 2021,"Despite being a big fan of Gene Hackman's work, for some reason I had never sat down to watch ""The French Connection"" (the film that vaulted him to Hollywood stardom). Unfortunately, upon correcting that oversight, I found the movie to be overly bleak and perhaps only suited for fans of minimalistic, gritty cop dramas.For a very basic overview, ""French Connection"" sees the narcotics cop duo of Popeye Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Roy Scheider) trying to clean up the mean streets of Brooklyn. On one particular case, however, they stumble into a drug ring that has ties to some heavy dealers from France, prompting a cat-and-mouse game of surveillance between both sides.For a certain type of cinema fan, I can see why this film is revered. Director William Friedkin takes an absolutely no-nonsense approach to the cinematography, imbuing it with no contrived drama or thrills. This is police work closer to reality than entertainment, filled with long stretches just observing punctuated by brief spates of action. The handheld camera style also makes viewers feel as if they are stalking the NY streets with Doyle and Russo.The major problem I had with ""French Connection"", however, is that the gritty aesthetic does not in any way service the plot or characters. Plot-wise, there are seemingly no stakes because viewers are not clued in to how/why any of the actions are important in the grand scheme of things (other than the generic ""drug dealers are bad; cops who catch them are good"" sort of tack). Again, the overall exercise here is ""style over substance"".Perhaps even more inexcusable is the utter refusal to delve into the two lead characters almost at all. Hackman does his usual great/intense work, and Scheider is uniquely interesting in his own right. However, the pair don't get an ounce of characterization beyond the ""tough, overbearing cop"" (Hackman) and ""slightly less intense partner"" (Scheider). More scenes featuring the thoughts or emotions of either of those men would have gone a long way towards gaining more emotional investment out of this viewer.Overall, I was disappointed in ""The French Connection"" both as a Hackman vehicle and just an entire film. Besides one legitimately thrilling scene (the famed subway chase) and a few intense Hackman moments, I found the rest to be bordering on boring. Other than gritty realism, this film doesn't have much else to offer.",The French Connection
55,poe426,Cat and mouse classic...,10,22 September 2014,"Years ago, in an effort to expand her horizons, I sat my wife down and showed her Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, STRAY DOG. In STRAY DOG, there's a sequence where our star, Toshiro Mifune, must infiltrate the black market and try to recover his stolen pistol before it can be used in the commission of a felony. It's not a short sequence: Kurosawa's intention was to show how long and difficult a task it was to get in good with the black market dealers. To this day, my wife rolls her eyes and groans every time I mention STRAY DOG, because of that one sequence. But the same thing could be said of THE FRENCH CONNECTION, with its game of cat and mouse between the New York detectives and the mysterious (but oh-so-clever) Frenchman, played so beautifully by Fernando Rey. When Gene Hackman and/or Roy Scheider are footracing felons through the streets of one of the greatest cities on the face of the Earth or Hackman is commandeering a civilian car to engage in one of the greatest chase scenes in movie history, THE FRENCH CONNECTION is edge-of-your-seat exciting; when our heroes are being outmanuvered by the Frenchman... not so much. (To SOME, I should say- but, to me, THE FRENCH CONNECTION is edge-of-your-seat fascinating from beginning to end.) For the record: Hackman is unforgettable, the action is high-octane, and the filmmaking topnotch.

56,johnnyboyz,A Poor connection.,5,22 November 2006,"Although it was the best picture winner at the 1972 Oscars, successfully yet tragically fending off Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange', 'The French Connection' is nothing more than a slow, nasty looking, overly deliberate piece of 'gritty' film-making that misses the target by a long, long way.Although these things that are bad and that are going for it the whole time, there are also a few other basic things that I really couldn't believe had been included. The film has quite a reputation, thanks to a certain car chase scene; no doubt, but also seems to want to be hailed as a film that breaks away from censorship issues. This is due to the fact it uses a 'no-rules cop' character, offensive and sometimes racist dialogue and shows the morning after kinky sex. However, all these aspects just felt as if they were shoved in to put pay to the setting and funnily enough, most of these occurrences happen within the first thirty minutes, attempting a blatant 'shock tactics' method. What really lets The French Connection down throughout is its editing. This actually won an Oscar for its editing, believe it or not, and it's absolutely stunning that the Academy came to this conclusion as it's choppy, random and just plain 'noticeable'; this being key as good editing is, indeed, 'un-noticeable'.The script is also a point of concern. Twinned with the bizarre editing, the script is slow, laborious and a lot of it is carelessly mumbled through by the two leads who do not share any chemistry at all (Maybe they realised this half way through and as a result, chopped out Scheider's character a little). The reasons that certain events actually occur are not clear enough for the audience. Maybe this is where the film demands a second viewing but why would anyone want to put themselves through the, almost, torture of watching really shoddy film-making for a second time? This is where the two flaws are linked: The mumbling actors and wired revelations connect to make something perplexing and mood-less.This brings me onto the music. I felt the music tried too hard; it was trying to say something or create something that, really, was never actually there. Maybe it tried too hard but I felt it was dated, out-of-place and very, very forced.Despite wining its Oscars, The French Connection isn't actually anything to get too excited about. The car chase was good, however, and when Hackman was actually ACTING the script rather than talking it, certain scenes did work. But there weren't enough of these things to counter-act the negative points and if you can't get the basics right within the first half hour; you're struggling.",The French Connection

Watched The French Connection (1971)Quite slow at the beginning but then gets intriguing, intense towards the end. It has been habitual for me to watch Cop drama in more entertaining and shiny way where i would see lot of gun firing, action, thrill etc. But The French Connection is purely based on smuggling and all the stuff mentioned above can't be expected from Narcotics cops. So it has to be realistic which it is but the problem appears in the first 40 minutes when it tries to set the plot. Till then the film is quite slow but afterwards there is full on cat and mouse hunting. Gene Hackman rules the narrative with his excellent performance. Roy Scheider as his buddy looks friendly enough, Fernando Rey and Tony Lo Bianco as Smugglers looked quite promising. The screenplay of around 100 minutes having boring moments in the begining is unacceptable but thankfully it covers the loss by the end. Cinematography, Dialogues, Locations are damn too realistic just as it was needed for the theme. Director William Friedkin attempts to deliver a solid cop film and he almost succeeds in it. If i have to exclude the slow pacing then there's nothing much wrong with his direction and believe me the Climax is worthy. Overall, a fine and highly realistic Cop drama but could have been better.

60,Anonymous_Maxine,"Are you now, or have you ever been in any way connected to the French???",5,24 April 2004,"Wait, lemme check something really quick. Ah yes, here we go, FIVE Academy Awards. WOW. Now, I'm no expert on movies (note: I am an expert on movies) but I really can't see what it is about this movie that is deserving of that many Oscars. Never do I get more angry responses to my reviews than when I write a scathing review of a hugely popular movie (I've gotten lots of ridiculous mail from fans of the staggeringly idiotic Scary Movie series, for example), but I can't see the appeal of The French Connection. Feel free to e-mail me and tell me how dumb I am, but I will never relent to the suggestion that this turgid crime film ever deserved more recognition that Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Granted, Kubrick's work is not very widely palatable and the Academy Awards have long since been a ceremony aimed at rewarding popularity rather than artistic quality (this curious little factoid was proven in spectacular fashion in 1997), but I find it hard to believe that even at the time, when sex and violence were probably not nearly as accepted as they are today, The French Connection could have come in above A Clockwork Orange.In the movie's defense, It is finely crafted and original, setting up what was to become a hugely copied setup of crime movies featuring a detective who is so dedicated to his assignments and determined to catch the bad guy that he/she has to go outside the agency and solve the crime alone, since some rules have to be broken. Gene Hackman's character is famously the one that is `Bad news, but a good cop.' I think that the movie's biggest problem today is that it is famous for having the greatest car chase ever put on film. In watching for the greatest car chase ever put on film, I was amazed when the credits started. Sure, the scene where Doyle (Hackman) was chasing the bad guy in the subway train was expertly crafted if short and unspectacular, and not the greatest car chase ever put on film b any stretch of the imagination. Maybe it was the greatest car chase put on film in 1971. Anything beyond that is going a little too far. The editing of the car chase is excellent (note the shot where the large truck/van pulls out in front of Doyle's car, and how smooth the match cut is on the action to a different angle. VERY good), the chase itself is not.The story is simple enough, Doyle is a detective frantically trying to topple a drug ring importing drugs from France, and the movie follows this plot in a simple and relatively realistic fashion, which I think is the film's greatest strength. As far as the technical way that it is put together, this is far superior to the action movies of today as far as the amount of thought put into its script and production, but as far as action it just doesn't compare. On the other hand, there's nothing worse than an action movie plagued by relentless stupidity (see Bad Boys II), but on the same token, an action film cannot be said to be one of the greatest ever made (or have the greatest parts, such as the car chases) simply because it is smartly made.Maybe The French Connection really did have the greatest car chase ever filmed at the time it was made. That statement is certainly not true as of today and the movie was certainly not the best picture of 1971, but I think as long as you don't go into it expecting a smashing great action film that lives up to the hype, there is a lot in The French Connection that could greatly benefit the moronic action movies cranked out regularly today.",The French Connection

Brilliant classic!,10,8 December 2018,"This is NOT a regular thriller, although it is very suspenseful at times. This is NOT a regular action movie, although it has some really exhilarating action sequences, but beware that this movie initially starts out really slow. Have patience though, because this movie starts to derail into a continuous, exciting frenzy in the second half. This is NOT a straight cop drama either, although the characters are true to life. What is it then? It is all the above combined. But most of all, it is RAW! F*ing raw, blunt, depressing and bleak.""The French Connection"" is a critical portrait of the futility of the war on drugs by the NYPD. Not made to please you. Not made to entertain you. It is DELIBERATELY slow and tiresome at times, yet the acting, editing and the photography are one of the best of the entire seventies, for those interested in these Oscar (5!) awarded talents. Dont expect flashy photography though. It is all bleak, slowburning and blunt. And in your face. It is New York's seventies gory side of street life, magnificently captured for us movie lovers.The story (based on true events) is about 2 narcotic cops, of which one is living on the edge (Gene Hackman). They try to make a big drug bust and the story is all about the cat and mouse game between a drugslord and the 2 cops. Although based on a true story, director William Friedkin admitted that he didnt even read the book on which the screenplay was based. In interviews he mentioned that this movie wasnt about the book, but all about capturing the true to life NYPD narcotics cop scene. Before he made ""The French Connection"" director Friedkin debuted with documentaries and that shows. Several real life cops do act in this movie and some of the chase scenes were shot in real life traffic, without any permit. Total madness, but they could get away with it, because director William Friedkin had gotten the backing for this movie from the real life NYPD force.""The French Connection"" is the epitome of director William Friedkin's raw energetic way of filming. It's recommended to watch an interview with this legendary director about the making of this classic, because he is one of the few great directors who dares to speak out freely about whatever he wants. Guaranteed delight to watch this maestro revel and roar. Just as he did in his masterpiece ""The French Connection"". (By the way, dont watch the sequel, that one is a disappointment...)",The French Connection
62,jzappa,"Hard-Boiled, Matter-of-Fact, Ground-Level Film-making",10,28 October 2007,"The French Connection has a shrewd, hardened language no one can put in writing. Literally. Despite They Shoot Horses screenwriter Ernest Tidyman's arbitrary screen writing credit and even his subsequent Oscar, there was no script to the picture. It was all impromptu dialogue from Friedkin's experiences witnessing dozens of people injecting themselves with heroin under the tongue, in the vagina, between the toes, and the real-life Popeye and Cloudy busting those people.Friedkin bloodies the Old World charm of Marseilles with a cold, brutal murder barely two minutes into the film. There's the gunshot, and the man's face is covered with blood in a quick close-up as he drops out of frame. The killer steps over the prone body, breaks off a piece of bread from the loaf the man carried, and chews it as he departs. On the streets of Brooklyn, Friedkin introduces us to Popeye, staking out in a bright red Santa Claus suit when he and Cloudy chase a drug pusher. When the pusher falls running through a vacant lot, Popeye pounces on top of him. Cloudy has to pull Santa off, shouting, ""Don't kill him!"" The wry morbidity in both these scenes visually establishes the fatalistic cynical brand of Friedkin's humor as well as his street reality. They also present a world in chaos in which tranquil cobblestone streets are red with death and Santa Claus busts pushers. Friedkin gives not just new definition to the thriller genre, but unique. The gray shadings have never had such high resolution before. For example, back at the station after booking the dealer, we've seen the doughy, dirty, unshaven Popeye in action, and in a couple of three-word absolutes, we hear his philosophy, which is as crass, pitiless and bigoted as they come.Popeye and Friedkin's New York is a cesspool, ugly and sinister, but they've been hardened to it, desensitized. Popeye and the street have become one, both comfortable in their anger. The action entirely tells the story and reveals the characters. Morality is less important than physical danger. Nobody launches into a diatribe on the evils of drug use. Just as Hackman fiercely portrays, Eddie Egan lived and breathed his job. No wardrobe. No relationships. Juxtaposing images of violent drug-related death, brutal shakedowns and internal fights between cops against Popeye's determination, Friedkin embodies the idea within the narrative while simultaneously maintaining the chase like speed of it all.The shooting process itself was not only spontaneous in the sense that it was intended as documentary-style but to the twenty-fifth power: With Hackman and Friedkin at one another's throats throughout, over thirty takes were squandered of the beginning street interrogation scene before Friedkin later realized just how unfettered this process had to be for the actors, cinematographer Owen Roizman and the nature of the dialogue. So he gave the actors a whole courtyard, a notion of the scene, and just let them wail on it. One take. Two cameras. He chose the best moments and sparked one of the most brilliant strokes of realism, and one of the film's very few quotes, which was Hackman's Poughkeepsie line, having absorbed it from his character's real-life basis, the very simplistically clever double-talk interrogation technique. It's never explained to us. We get it the way you get what someone says in the jerky urban rhythms of a rush-hour street life. No one explains anything. It's all gut.Everything---including the famous car chase which, for its raw encapsulation of the central theme of relentless pursuit, remains not only a benchmark in but untouchable example of action cinema---was shot with available light. It's a matter of movement, choosing the right lenses and trying to keep some kind of matching control on one's lighting because you're going in and out of dark and light areas. Literally half of the effectiveness of the movie, without any question, comes from the sound and editing. At the same time, literally half of the movie has no dialogue at all! It's a story told in pictures, movement. It's universal.You feel the same things that are being felt on screen. You just quake a bit. It's all present-tense. Suspense creates fear and fear becomes a high. Fear and tension harmonize one another even when Friedkin compels us to scrutinize in unsettling detail the testing of the heroin for potency. He plugs the screen with maximum close-ups of the flame heating the mineral oil, a needle grazing the white powder, the mercury rising in the thermometer. They're scary images challenging our fear of death, the fundamental, basest fear. As a primevally aural windfall to this moment, the gristly-haired chemist watches the mercury rise declaring the powder ""U.S. government certified"" to ""junk-of-the-month-club sirloin steak"" to ""absolute dynamite, eighty-nine percent pure junk"" with increasing admiration.The fascistic undertones of the Popeye Doyle character echo those of Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry, yet this film remains ambivalent toward its protagonist. The scene in which Frog One eludes Popeye's tail with a sleight-of-hand trick on the subway is doubly important because not only has Doyle been outsmarted by a foreigner in his own town, but it compounds his frustration and serves to highlight that he is not a super cop. And Friedkin does not tell us this, he shows us.It's Friedkin at his down-to-earth finest. He's not so much worried about the right or wrong of the story as he is with the authenticity, the candor, of the images. His world is inhabited by the faces of people who look like they belong to this grainy environment. The only message is what we care to read into it. If you embrace his reality, his visualization, you give it credibility. If not, you nevertheless give it credibility because you are, actually, saying this vitiated reality is too much, too forceful.",The French Connection
63,GOWBTW,An Internationally Intriguing movie!,10,17 September 2016,"Gene Hackman really put his acting chops into good use. ""The French Connection"" is a intriguing, high octane crime story. Hackman plays Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, a hard-boiled New York police detective whose actions can get him into heat with his superiors. While doing his duty to bust drug runners in New York, overseas in Marseilles France, a drug smuggler is being used to smuggle in heroin in Lincoln Continental Mark III. Following the testing of the drugs, the the gang would make the move on distribution. The French team also went to auto auctions to find repos, so they can get their drugs into the open. Back in the precinct, there is animosity between Doyle and another officer. And Doyle and his partner Russo (Roy Schieder) go after the leader. My favorite part of the movie is the chase. One of the smugglers gets on the subway metro and tries to elude Doyle. The guy kills a train cop and a brave passenger. While Doyle was hot on his trail, he avoids every danger the best way he can. After the metro is wrecked, and the car Doyle drives in done in, both men make the move. But Doyle gets the guy in one shot. Detectives are tenacious on finding something, when they have the Lincoln stripped down, the others couldn't find any drugs. But when Russo asked about the weight of the car, they missed a spot. After finding out where the drugs are hidden, the two accomplices would find the car and get back into the business. When the French hit man finds out there was more than what he was bargaining for, he went back to France, wanting out of the deal. Then the shootout ensures. Very epic. This is before I was even born, and it was a hit. I'm a New York native, and my father worked with the NYPD. This is a keeper for a very, very long time. Enjoy The French Connection! 5 Stars! Gene Hackman plays it best!",The French Connection
64,FiendishDramaturgy,Above Average,9,19 May 2007,"1971. Gene Hackman, Fernando Rey, Roy Scheider. New York Detective ""Popeye"" Doyle and his partner chase a French heroin smuggler. Well, the plot is more involved than all that, but not so much as to lose its way in the telling of it.Hackman's performance is one of the grittiest performances I had ever seen, at the time of my first viewing of this film, and it still resonates, today, as a truly intense performance.The action is sufficient to entertain the mindless, and the performances are professional enough to soothe the critical evaluation. The story is involving enough to entertain throughout, and the cohesion of the finished product is complete.I have seen much worse, but in the annals of cop movies, I've rarely seen better.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",The French Connection
65,jadavix,"Brutal, exhilarating, offensive",9,7 March 2016,"One of the joys of revisiting older movies is finding out where all those movies you took in growing up got their start.The '80s and '90s were absolutely inundated with action movies about tough cops who don't play by the rules and get results. The ""buddy"" cop movie was another one we have all seen countless times before; generally the partners are mismatched in some ridiculous way, don't like each other at first, and learn to rely on each other later.Movies like ""The French Connection"", ""Bullitt"", ""Dirty Harry"" were all clear progenitors of this craze. The main difference is that these late '60s/early '70s movies were ultra-realistic and cold as ice. In my opinion the action movie has never topped these because the grit and realism made the action on screen palpable. When Popeye Doyle and Buddy Russo chase the dope pusher at the beginning of the movie, I was struck by the visceral thrill: I felt what these guys were feeling.Then came Stallone, Van Damme, Schwarzennegger. Guys so big and so fit they never would have had time to chase criminals; they'd be too busy doing squats. There is nothing visceral about seeing men with cartoonish physiques perform feats of strength. But guys like Gene Hackman? You can understand their anger at being made to run flat out in the first instance.The realism in ""The French Connection"" does have a negative side, however. For one thing, the movie's ending comes out of nowhere. This added to the stunning reaction of the movie audiences had upon release, but now? We aren't used to seeing movies, especially police/action movies, end like that. It's more of a surprise, and not a pleasant one.The other thing is that Popeye Doyle is not a likable character. He's a racist scumbag. You can see shades of Vic Mackey in the way he takes over a bar and searches everyone. He may not be corrupt, but he's a dirty cop, and hearing him talk about ""spics"" and ""niggers"" made me want to root for the bad guys.There is, of course, the chase scene, but then ""The French Connection"" is just one long chase scene. It's brutal and direct as a shot of adrenalin straight to the brain. Just be wary of the side effects.",The French Connection
66,ackstasis,"""All right, Popeye's here! Get your hands on your heads, get off the bar, and get on the wall!""",8,20 January 2007,"William Friedkin's 'The French Connection' was adapted from Robin Moore's non-fiction book, ""The French Connection: A True Account of Cops, Narcotics, and International Conspiracy."" The story tells of two New York policemen who attempt to intercept a shipment of narcotics from France. With superb acting, thrilling suspense and Owen Roizman's brilliant, gritty cinematography, this is one of the best cop thrillers I've seen, and certainly a deserving recipient of the 1971 Academy Award for Best Picture (even though, personally, I would have given the honours to Stanley Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange.')Gene Hackman (""Mississippi Burning,"" 1988) in a terrific, career-defining and Oscar-winning role is Det. Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, a well-respected narcotics policemen, though his ""hunches"" occasionally have the habit of turning awry. Roy Scheider (""Jaws,"" 1975) portrays Doyle's loyal partner, Det. Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo. Together, they stalk the bustling streets of New York City, tailing suspected drug dealers and staking out suspicious vehicles. Fernando Rey (""1492: Conquest of Paradise,"" 1992) - who, incidentally, was actually cast into the film by mistake - is brilliant as Alain Charnier, a French suspected drug dealer.Despite a somewhat slow beginning, 'The French Connection' gradually builds into a wonderfully-suspenseful thriller. Much of the excitement is derived simply from the thrill of the chase, as Doyle weaves across crowds, through subway stations, past store fronts, in an effort to trail his unsuspecting target without being noticed. The grainy, often-hand-held cinematography offers a raw, documentary-like feel, adding a sense of realism.Of course, no review of the film would be complete without a passing mention of the famous chase sequence. Though not what I typically would have expected of a car chase, the scene is brilliant, and it certainly kept me riveted. Despite not containing a note of music, the sequence uses sound effects, excellent cinematography and daring stunt work to great effect.For fans of the cop thriller genre, or of terrific film-making in general, 'The French Connection' is a must-see.",The French Connection
67,MBunge,This thing has not aged that well,5,19 September 2010,"If you only look at The French Connection as an ordinary cops-n-robbers drama from the early 1970s, it's okay with some startling violence and one really good chase scene. When you consider that it won a Best Picture Oscar, you're forced to wonder what the Academy voters were smoking that year and whether you can get any of it for yourself.Here's the rather skimpy plot of the movie. Loud mouthed, bullying narcotics detective ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) drags his coat rack of a partner ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) to a night club. They spot a table full of criminals with one guy they don't recognize. ""Popeye"" and ""Cloudy"" start following that guy, which leads to them following other guys, which leads to even more following of various sorts until all the crooks and all the cops end up at the same huge heroin deal. And that'spretty much it. Throw in a lively performance by Hackman as the sort of flawed anti-hero that still seemed fresh and new in the early 70s, an outstanding car vs. subway chase and an ending that strives for social commentary and you've got a film that's still a decent piece of entertainment all these decades later. But is this something worthy of an Academy Award for Best Picture? Not unless every other movie out that year was made by Ed Wood.Since The French Connection first hit theaters the year I was born, it's almost impossible for me to appreciate what affect it had on people back then. Whatever it was that the audience and the critics responded to, however, it hasn't aged all that well. The plot is almost painfully simple. The only characters that get to do more than mouth expository dialog are ""Popeye"" Doyle and French drug dealer Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey). The movie is filled with long, slow sequences where somebody is following somebody else. These aren't chase scenes. I mean one guy walking and another guy walking behind him or one guy driving and another guy driving behind him. These multiple following scenes go on forever, have no dialog and nothing happens except ordinary movement. Even the mystery involving the hidden heroin shipment and the big drug deal is more explained to the viewer than solved.Which isn't to say The French Connection is a bad or unentertaining movie. It's focus on the unglamorous and tedious legwork of investigation is unusual enough to keep your attention at first blush, though I think I'd be bored out of my mind if I watched the film again. Hackman is engaging as a cop who thinks his badge gives him license to do whatever he wants out on the street. And that car vs. subway chase is very impressive by modern standards, which means it had to have been astonishing in its own era.If you're looking for a classic crime drama, I don't think I can recommend this film. It's too much a candidate for ""Long Attention Span Theater"" and most folks under the age of 40 won't be able to discern what made The French Connection so noteworthy in its day. But if all you want is some decent cops-and-robbers storytelling or you're doing a scholarly thesis on cinema of the 1970s, this movie will fit the bill.",The French Connection
68,CubsandCulture,"Stylish, exciting but hollow, amoral.",5,26 December 2018,"Between Hackman's easy naturalism and Friedkin's Noir-isque gritty realism the film is rather entertaining. It simply moves; it feels like a chase scene the entire time and the film does not dwell on trivial things. The famous train-car chase scene is rather unique. I have never quite seen a two tier chase before. This is something of a weird comparison but it reminds me of the chariot race in Ben-Hur given how both are so central for the their respective films and each scene is the best of their films. But I think this comparison really highlights my problem with the French Connection. Unlike the chariot scene we really don't know the heavy all that well. We know he is a bad man but that is pretty much it. There is no emotional investment in any of the characters because of professional and impersonal manner the film treats them. Without a doubt this is part of the stories point and them but it doesn't work for me in light of several other factors.The main one of which is the screenplay is too plot driven. There is no fat here; the film never pauses to catch its breath and each scene, each line of dialog only moves the plot forward. That the film is entirely a crime story with nothing else in mind makes it thin and shallow. I have seen this film 2-3 times and nothing is surprising on each viewing; worse it gets less exciting each time I have seen it as the surprise is less and less. The screenplay is tightly plotted and it is a good story but it is procedural and basic. There is no irony here.And irony was rather needed given Popeye's brutality. I guess the ending is intended to be tragic-Popeye gets what he deserves in a way-but it is too slight, especially as the Buddy-Popeye relationship isn't fleshed out a lot. The implied loss of Buddy is not enough of a just dessert. Popeye's racism, abuse of power and amorality requires a greater cost. The film does not deal with the means enough. Like Popeye it is too concerned with ends. While the works on a certain level, it strikes me as very ugly in the end. The film doesn't for a second consider maybe the drug war isn't worth harassing black people over and that robs it of relevancy.A clockwork plot with stylish direction and very good acting results in a fun film not a very good one. This is one of the weaker best pictures.",The French Connection
69,jimbo-53-186511,"A little bit slow to get going, but otherwise this is a solid and gritty thriller",8,17 August 2014,"NYC cops Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider)finish a fairly routine shift and decide to go for a drink together after work. Whilst they are drinking in the bar, Doyle notices Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco)dining at a table within the bar. Doyle has a 'hunch' that something isn't quite right with this man. Boca has two cars and dines in expensive restaurants even though he only runs a small newsagent so they're suspicious as to where he's getting all his money from. Doyle is tipped off that there is a big shipment due to arrive in New York soon and as a result of this tip off he asks his commanding officer if he can put a wire tap on Sal Boca. Doyle's commanding officer is reluctant about applying to the court to get a wire tap in place at first due to the fact that Doyle's 'hunches' haven't always paid off, but he eventually agrees. With the wire tap in place, Doyle and Russo hear a conversation between Sal and a Frenchman whereby the two men arrange a meeting. Sensing that all is not well, Doyle and Russo decide to tail Sal and Frenchman Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey)to try to get to the bottom of what's going on. This is a really solid and gritty thriller and it's easy to see how this film may have acted as the 'fore front' for buddy cop films that have followed - I reckon the Lethal Weapon franchise owes a nod to this film. It's clear that Hackman is the 'unhinged' one - using questionable methods to get results, the out of control drinking (Mel Gibson's character in Lethal Weapon showed similar traits). Schneider plays it more straight and by the book (like Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon). The chemistry is good between Hackman and Scheider which is good because the first half of the film was very slow moving. I understand that the cuts between Marseille and New York were necessary to develop the plot, it did feel like there was far too much build up. I personally felt that if they'd trimmed this by 15 minutes that it wouldn't have harmed the overall effect of the film. The film is slow, but never to the point where it becomes boring. The train scene between Doyle and Charnier was particularly good - it was both enjoyable and clever.Hackman puts in a solid performance and I've always liked him as an actor. His gritty, no nonsense approach made him a joy to watch. Scheider didn't fair quite as well, but he still did OK. The supporting cast were all roundly good as well. One thing I really liked in this film was the score; it was menacing and moody and really helped to make the tense scenes feel really tense.Once it gets going, this is a great film and became a fairly tense affair. The car chase scene being a notable highlight in the film. One thing I thought about this film was how realistic this chase sequence felt and was pleasantly surprised to learn that the car crash during this sequence was unplanned (according to IMDb trivia). I've always said that how much enjoyment you get from watching a film is how believable everything feels and an unplanned crash scene is about as believable as it gets.The French Connection is a very good film - it's gritty, hard edged, realistic and very well constructed. The only very minor gripe I have is that it is a little bit slow to get going, but once it does it becomes a first rate thriller that is well worth your time.",The French Connection

The storyline is basic and never gets interesting.I must still mention that the train chase was awesome though, it definitely inspired the train chase in the video game Driver 2 (2000). There are so many similarities. The train stations look similar, the train track is over the road and has the same looking architecture, Gene Hackman was driving the same car (though colour is different) as John Tanner, the first-person camera work is very similar with the same shaky effect, the guy which was being chased wore similar clothes and his face looked very similar, there was a moment of driving through boxes and the long white wall was also there. I'm extremely impressed of how accurately Driver 2 remade the train chase sequence.Anyway back to the film itself, it was very dull for the most part, a few cool scenes do not make it up for the rest.

The true story of two real New York City cops who exposed one of the biggest drug smuggling rings of all time. Gene Hackman plays bad cop ""Popeye"" Doyle, while Roy Scheider is his more laid back partner, ""Cloudy"". Through pure instinct they follow suspicious characters and hit the jackpot when their hunch pays off. The film benefits from a real gritty and dirty vibe that captures what the city was like in the early '70s.It's a good cop film. My final verdict is that it's one of those movies that was likely much stronger at the time of its release. Not that it doesn't have its moments, but to win FIVE Oscars -- really? I don't see that. Gene Hackman's turn as the loud-mouthed and prejudiced Popeye Doyle is only really an incredible performance when you later factor in through the audio commentary that Hackman in real life is nothing like the obnoxious tough guy he's portraying. William Friedkin's direction is pretty good, but an Academy Award? Roy Scheider's character is underwritten and in the background. The celebrated car chase (or is it a train chase) here is admittedly quite suspenseful, but I prefer the one in THE SEVEN-UPS (1973). *** out of ****",The French Connection

Then there are the great genre films, which work within their genre confines while expanding the boundaries for genre films to come.Such is the police procedural ""The French Connection.""The streets of New York City have been bone-dry of heroin for some time, but vice detective Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) has his eye out for a big score. He sets his sights on a candy-store owner named Boca (Tony Lo Bianco). Boca, it turns out, has a connection in Marseilles who is offering 60 kilos of junk for a half-million dollars. Can Popeye and his team catch Boca before his connection catches the next ship home?For a cop movie, ""The French Connection"" moves rather differently. Exposition is held to a minimum as we spend the first half of the movie watching stake-outs and tailings, often playing in conjunction with Don Ellis' moody, jazzy score. We watch Popeye and his partner ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) roust bar patrons and tangle with federal agents, but we don't get long conversations or scenes where someone explains what it's all about.When ""French Connection"" came out, this confused a lot of people. MAD magazine did a parody where a character we see meet an unfortunate end at the outset keeps coming back and asking ""Yeah, but WHAT'S the connection?"" Even now, there are those who say the film is too confusing and others who say everything that happens on screen makes sense to anyone paying attention.They're both wrong. ""French Connection"" is a film of stylish misdirection, keeping you guessing because you aren't supposed to be that clued in. Director William Friedkin is doing his own version of Popeye's famous ""pick-your-feet-in-Poughkeepsie"" rant on us, playing us to expect one thing when we get something else. The result makes for lively, smart entertainment.The film's big scene is where this all pays off: Popeye's famous chase, of a secondary character named Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) through the crowded streets of the city, Popeye in a borrowed car, Nicoli on an elevated train. It's a fine sequence in isolation, but really takes off in context with the rest of the movie, where we've been kept waiting and watching for something to break for an hour, feeling as stifled as Popeye and Cloudy in their stakeout car.Friedkin in the DVD commentary talks about working with both French New Wave influences and documentary-style pacing, trying to make each moment as real as possible. This could be deadly except for the strong acting on display. Hackman earned an Academy Award for sheer intensity, making every moment on screen as visceral as possible.The actors around him are great, especially Scheider and Fernando Rey as the very cool lead villain, a Corsican boatyard operator who confesses to an associate at one point that ""I haven't done an honest day's work since I climbed off the crane."" It's fun watching Popeye getting hosed down all the time by his superior, played by Eddie Egan who was Popeye for all practical purposes in the real case. Egan and other real people are integrated so smoothly into the film you think they're method actors, too.The film plays fast and loose with reality at times. From the roof of a tall building, Doyle watches someone running across a street at the end of one shot, and is running after him just yards away in the next. A famous scene with a car in a garage has left generations of viewers asking the simple question: How? But if you accept this as part of Friedkin's effective gamesmanship, you are amply rewarded with riveting, believable entertainment.""What's the connection?"" the guy in MAD wanted to know. The answer may be every good cop film that's come since.",The French Connection
75,Enchorde,Thriller that has stood the test of time,7,2 February 2010,"Recap: Popeye Doyle and his partner Buddy Russo stumbles on a case of a drug smuggling operation. The masterminds behind them are particularly shrewd and ruthless in elimination competition and not afraid of going up against the cops. But they don't leave much traces around on Doyle and Russo only got hunches to go on. Unfortunately their reputation has been damaged by a recent case that went wrong, and their captain doesn't trust them.Comments: A classic thriller that has stood the test of time well. Hackman and Scheider plays Doyle and Russo respectively and makes a good team. But more importantly the story is a good one. A cat and mouse story where Doyle and Russo got a suspicion but nothing more. But they are not the only characters active and driving the story. The bad guys drives the story forward in equal part, which means the hunt isn't just one sided, a rarity in thrillers to this day.It's a interesting and exciting story that kept me more or less on the edge throughout the entire movie. That shows that a good story is more or less timeless. Sure, some clothes and hairstyles have changed, a lot, but that didn't disturb me at all. The story keeps the focus off such things.Otherwise it got most components that an actionthriller should have. A good car chase, with some real elements (check trivia), some decent shootouts and some mysteries that need solving as we go along. A very good movie, still worth watching.7/10",The French Connection
76,ShootingShark,"Classic, Riveting, Groundbreaking, Stunningly-Made NYC Cop Thriller",8,16 August 2007,"Doyle and Russo are two tough New York cops playing a hunch that there's a big heroin score coming in. They make Sal Boca, a small-time operator, and tie him to an elusive Frenchman, Alain Charnier, who just may be a heroin smuggler from Marseille. Can they track down the haul and make the collar ?The two definitive cop movies of all time came out just weeks apart in late 1971; Dirty Harry and The French Connection. This film is one of those rarities where the timing seemed to be just magic - most of the cast and crew had little or no movie experience but turned out to be cinematic gold, particularly Friedkin, Hackman, Scheider, director of photography Owen Roizman and editor Jerry Greenberg. They all brought to the film an incredible confidence, wild energy, invisible artistry and tremendous authenticity. If this movie is anything, it's a gut-punch which leaves you winded and amazed; in my view there's been no other crime-thriller which is so down-and-dirty, so streetwise believable and yet exhilarating at the same time. Friedkin's genius is to depict the investigation with painstaking authenticity (he refers to it as induced documentary), but always with one eye on suspense, action and dramatic conflict. It's a style that's simply been copied ever since, especially on TV, and it puts you right into the world the movie creates. These are guys who think nothing of sleeping in a car for a week to get a lead on a suspect, and can spot a crooked deal a mile off. Hackman and Scheider are so good you forget they're reading a script - they simply are Popeye and Cloudy, and their rapport (sadly they've never worked again since) is just perfect. Every aspect of the production is first-rate - camera-work, editing, Ernest Tidyman's ruthlessly pared-down script, score, stuntwork - it's a model to aspire to. The memorable chase sequence with Hackman driving like a maniac beneath the elevated train is one of the best ever filmed, but is only one of the movie's many breathtaking scenes, like the brilliant contrast of the villains eating haute cuisine while the cops freeze outside, the long surveillance montages, the car-stripping sequence or the starkly enigmatic ending. Based on a real life 1962 bust by NYPD narcotics detectives Eddie Egan (who plays the precinct captain) and Sonny Grosso (who plays the fed who follows Sal to Washington), who acted as consultants on the film. Shot in terrific locations in Queens, Brooklyn (the chase is down 86th Street), Manhattan and the wonderfully bleak Randall's Island. This is about the only really great movie which was a big Oscar success, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Script and Best Editing - all richly deserved, but in a way if anything makes this movie then it's the photography and that's the one award it didn't win. Owen Roizman's work here is simply faultless, inspired brilliance - he had only made one obscure low-budget film before this, went on to produce an excellent body of work (The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three, The Addams Family, many others) and retired at the top of his game. If you haven't seen this movie, run, don't walk, to someplace where you can.",The French Connection

Gene Hackman as Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle and Roy Scheider as Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo are great as the two detectives chasing and following a couple of people including Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) and Salvatore Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) who are involved in a drugs deal.

78,davidmvining,A Technically Invigorating Procedural,7,31 December 2020,"This is a stripped down bare version of the crime thriller. Characters exist purely as archetypes with little to no life outside of the job at hand. The movie is purely about the crime and ensuing investigation. The movie is told in a handheld, cinema verité style that was fresh to the genre at the time, which explains a lot of the love for the film in the 70s. It was a new way to tell a story, but once you get past that you realize that the actual story is pretty standard and the characters are rather thin. It's an entertaining 104 minutes, for sure, but I question its level of greatness.So, the story centers around Popeye Doyle, a hard nosed cop in New York who does nothing but his job and drink (and occasionally pick up random women on the street) who just loves shaking down petty criminals in the narcotics division with his partner Buddy Russo. One night after work, Popeye and Buddy catch sight of a table of known criminal elements at a table by accident which pings their radar, and they start to look into it. Combined with the fact that the drug scene they're navigating seems paltry, Doyle is convinced there's something big going on with the people at that table. With a wiretap, they discover that their lead, Sal Boca, is interacting with a Frenchman who could be the source of a new shipment of drugs. It's thin stuff, and Popeye is on a short leash. It all pans out, of course, or else there's no movie.The movie has no real mystery to it since we know from the beginning that Frog 1 (Alain, played by Fernando Rey) is bringing in drugs, that he's using a French television star to do it, and that it has something to do with the star's car (the only real mystery is where in the car), but that's why its stylistic choices end up being so important. There's an urgency to the action that the rough production aesthetic lends to the events that help buoy the story along. Sure, we know that Sal is working with Alain well ahead of Popeye figuring it out, but the joy is the process as we watch Alain and Popeye dance around each other.The sequence where Popeye chases Alain around on foot through New York, with Alain jumping on and off subway trains, all while everyone in frame knows that Popeye is chasing Alain and that Alain knows it, is really strong material made out of glances and physical movement. And I think this sequence highlights the movie's central joys: despite its thinness, the movie is really well made. The feeling of tangible reality brought on by the extensive location shooting in dirty 1970s New York City provides a wonderful texture to the action and a great setting for Gene Hackman's Popeye to exist. His angry and violent approach to policework fits like a glove in this place. The violence of knife fights breaking out in the streets feels at home.Directed by William Friedkin, The French Connection understood how to combine its setting and material in a production appropriately and with real energy. Directing Gene Hackman into a rather memorable performance as Doyle, Friedkin helped craft a vivid archetype of the dedicated and morally suspect cop. The rest of the cast doesn't stand out nearly as much. As supporting players with little character to build off of, they act more as cogs in a machine than living breathing people. Fernando Rey, though, does bring a coy intelligence to Alain. The only actor who seems to be playing a full character is Frederic de Pascquale as Henri Devereaux, the French television star, though he's still rather limited to ""in over his head"" guy.I do quite enjoy the ride that is The French Connection. It's a technically proficient procedural. That aforementioned foot chase and the famed car chase (car vs. elevated train) are really edge of your seat type stuff, built expertly and cut together cleanly at the same time. I just kind of wish there was something more to any of these characters. Popeye, I think, is fine as he is as the rock on which this movie operates, but Buddy or Alain could have used more. Still, it's an entertaining ride while it lasts with that dirty 70s aesthetic and a surprisingly open-ended ending.",The French Connection
79,triple8,Did this movie have a plot?,5,25 March 2005,"French Connection is one of those movies that I've never quite figured out. It is slow moving, drags a lot, and doesn't seem to have much of a plot and yet many consider it a classic. I think I 'm still trying to figure out what the plot is.The best thing about this was the cinematography. It was a little grainy but I happen to like that so I didn't mind. But the fact that this is considered classic is baffling to me. I don't think it's awful or anything but it just seems like another movie. The dialog(what there was of it) made me sleepy and the action scenes weren't very exciting. And the plot was pretty thin. I mean there are dozens of movies, many a lot more interesting then this one, because there wasn't a lot that made sense in this movie.When I watched French Connection, I didn't walk out or anything but I did yawn a lot.

80,alexanderdavies-99382,In a league of its own!,10,22 June 2017,"""The French Connection"" needs no introduction. Along with ""Dirty Harry,"" it set such high standards for how a cop thriller should be made. The above film strives for realism and achieves this and more. Almost every camera shot was on location.The fact that ""The French Connection"" won major Oscars just about says it all. The film wisely has a documentary feel to it, seeing as the film is based upon real life events Gene Hackman became an overnight sensation in the lead. He was born to play Popeye Doyle, no one else could play that character. By turns, he is jolly, determined, obsessed and volatile. He has fine support from Roy Scheider, Tony LoBianco and Fernando Rey. A film like ""The French Connection"" benefited immensely from having technical advisors on hand, including the very two police officers whose careers this film is based. The car chase scene is one of the best I've ever seen. One of the ultimate masterpieces.",The French Connection
81,eric262003,The Ultimate Cop Flick,9,12 July 2019,"The French Connection is routinely included along with Bullitt, Diva, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, on the short list of movies with the greatest chase scenes of all time. What is not always remembered is what a good movie is apart from the chase scene. It featured a great early Gene Hackman performance that won an Academy Award, and it also won Oscars for Best Picture, Direction, Screenplay and Editing.
The movie is all surface, movement, violence and suspense. Only one of the characters really emerges into three dimensions: Popeye Doyle (Hackman), a New York cop who's vicious, obsessed and a little mad. The other characters don't emerge because there's no time for them to emerge. Things are happening too fast.
The storyline hardly matters. It involves a $32 million shipment of high-grade heroin smuggled from Marseilles to New York hidden in a Lincoln Continental. A complicated deal is set up between the French people, an American moneyman and the Mafia. Doyle is a tough cop with a shaky reputation who busts a lot of street junkies, needs a big win to keep his career together. He stumbles on the heroin deal and pursues it with a single-minded ferocity that is frankly amoral. He isn't after the smugglers because they're breaking the law; he's after them because his job consumes him.
Director William Friedkin constructed The French Connection so surely that it left audiences stunned. And I don't mean that as a reviewer's cliché: It is literally true. In a sense, the whole movie is a chase. It opens with a shot of a French detective keeping the Continental under surveillance, and from then on the smugglers and the law officers are endlessly circling and sniffing each other. It's just that the chase speed up sometimes, as in the celebrated car-train sequence.
In Bullitt, two cars and two drivers were matched against each other at fairly equal odds. In Friedkin's chase, the cop has to weave through city traffic at 70 m.p.h to keep up with a train that has a clear track: the odds are off-balance. And when the train's motorman dies and the train is without a driver, the chase gets even spookier. A man is matched against a machine that cannot understand risk or fear. This makes the chase psychologically scarier, in addition to everything is has going for it visually.
The movie was shot during a cold and gray New York winter, and it has a doomed, gritty look. The landscape is a wasteland, and the characters are hardly alive. They move out of habit and compulsion, long after ordinary human feelings have lost the power to move them. Doyle himself is a bad cop, by ordinary standards; he harasses and brutalizes people, he is a racist, he endangers innocent people during the chase scenes (which are a high speed ego trip). But he survives. He wins too, but that hardly matters. The French Connection is as amoral as its hero, as violent, as obsessed and frightening.
The key to the chase is that it occurs in an ordinary time and place. No rules are suspended; Popeye's car is racing down streets where ordinary traffic and pedestrians can be found, and his desperation is such that we believe, at times, he's capable of running down bystanders just to win the contest. In 1992, cinematographer Owen Roizman recalled the way the whole chase was painstakingly story-boarded and then broken down into shots that were possible and safe, even though actual locations were being employed. Lenses were chosen to play with distance, so that car sometimes seemed closer to hazards than it was. But essentially, the chase looked real because its many different parts were real: A car threads through city streets, chasing an elevated train.
The other key element in the film, of course, is Hackman. He was already well known in 1971, after performances in such films as Bonnie and Clyde, Downhill Racer and I Never Sang for my Father. But it's probably The French Connection that launched his career as a leading character star-a-man with the unique ability to make almost any dialogue plausible. As Popeye Doyle, he generated an almost frightening single-mindedness, a cold determination to win at all costs, which elevated the stakes in the story from a simple police cat-and-mouse chase into the acting-out of Popeye's pathology. The chase scene has, in a way, been a mixed blessing, distracting from the film's other qualities.",The French Connection

83,winner55,"The story is fascinating, really",10,10 May 2009,"Most of the complaints from reviewers who disliked this film fall into two categories: 1: the famous car/train chase was unexceptional; and, 2: the story is boring (because it is either too straightforward or too confusing, depending on the reviewer).Although the car/train chase is, cinematically speaking, a marvelously edited sequence, I suppose since such moments have to hit you viscerally, there's not much one can argue about as to whether it works or not. It probably does matter if you have come to identify with the hero and have recognized his driven, obsessed personality, but if you haven't, and the editing itself doesn't grab you, there's not much to discuss about the matter, you like it or you don't.The problem of the story is another matter. First, it's odd that the complaints are frequently contrary - either ""too complicated"" or ""too straightforward."" This raises the question, what kind of story these differing complaining audiences expect from a 'police procedural' movie. It also raises the question of whether the latent political issues of the film are coming through to such audiences, since the complications of the story really derive from the class conflict between the blue-collar detectives and the criminals who enjoy wealth and influence. And its important that none of these complaints either account for, or show interest in, the fact that the core of the narrative is that of an actual narcotics investigation of the middle '60s.Finally, most of those who give the film a bad review utterly ignore the personality issue - the film is, to some extent, a character study of a street-smart cop who has no life and who has become too obsessed with his job to get it done properly - the American mobsters get busted but the 'French connection' himself gets away.These issues also have political ramifications. Director Friedkin is obviously wary of being too blunt on the matter, but in the actual events from which the film is derived, the only criminals who got jail time were those without money and influence; the real-life 'French connection' was allowed to disappear back to France because he happened to be a war-time buddy of Charles DeGaulle. And the $30,000,000 heroin shipment finally did reach the street by leaking through an increasingly corrupt New York City police department - which showed its gratitude to the detective who broke the case (Popeye Egan) by firing him without pension for 'behavior unbecoming' without hearing (he later sued and won).I don't know, somehow I find such stories, or episodes from them, and their ramifications, inherently interesting. If you don't, this film is probably not for you.But just as a film, it must be said that there's a rugged, even occasionally crude but always energetic, craftsmanship on display here. Even if you don't care for the story, the film remains an audacious work of film making from a young director and generally young ensemble cast and crew.",The French Connection
84,philip_vanderveken,It's very nice that the line between good and bad wasn't obvious for once,8,1 March 2005,"There were two reasons why I really wanted to see this movie. The first one is that it has become a classic in movie history, the second is because Gene Hackman is in it. I have seen several of his later movies, but I never got the chance to see something of his earlier work. And it proved exactly what I've always known: He has always had plenty of talent and has always been a very fine actor.This time he is detective Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle from the Narcotics Bureau who, together with detective Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo (Roy Scheider), has stumbled onto a drug smuggling traffic between Marseille (For those who didn't know it yet: Marseille is a city in southern France) and New York City. Doyle is a short-tempered alcoholic, but also a hard-working and dedicated police officer. His adversary is Alain Charnier, a gentleman criminal who is one of the largest drug suppliers of pure heroin to North America. Doyle and Russo give Charnier enough room to bring in the drugs, but than go in for the bust. However, not everything goes as planned...This movie has an interesting mix of a good story, plenty of action and some fine acting to offer and you'll see one of the most famous car chases ever in film history. But what I liked even more about this movie may be the fact that this wasn't a movie based on the concept of ""good cop chasing some bad guys"". The line between good and bad in this movie is very thin. The cop is far from a nice guy and the criminal is not the worst man ever, something that makes this movie very interesting to watch. I really liked that and that's why I give it at least a 7.5/10. Oh well, make that an 8/10.",The French Connection
85,tomsview,Still connecting at 50,10,27 September 2021,"When I first saw ""The French Connection"" in 1971, long before it won any awards, I knew the cop/crime movie had gone up a notch; many notches in fact; the influence of its style and technique can still be felt today.A big surprise was Gene Hackman. He wasn't unknown, but at the time he was a chameleon of an actor, he seemed to shape shift into his roles. Suddenly he emerged as the epitome of the tough cop, not a superhero, just tough, and brave.His Popeye Doyle isn't exactly like the real-life figure he is based on because that guy is in the movie, Eddie Egan as Captain Simonson. You can see the difference, however there is a scene where Egan shows anger, and then you get it. For Hackman's Popeye, being a cop is his reason d'etre, although his private life is close to empty.""The French Connection"" is a buddy movie. Doyle doesn't work alone; his partner is Detective ""Cloudy"" Russo played by Roy Scheider, also stepping up from more obscure roles. Their partnership has similarities to Newman and Redford in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". They argue, they know the other's flaws, but they'll take a bullet for each other. It's such a powerful formula I'm surprised more shows don't use it.Something else. ""The French Connection"" gives the audience a sense of security. Criminals are tough and scary, but here are two cops that are tougher and they scare the criminals; they stand between us and the abyss. Same thing with Robert Duval's Colonel Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now""; you think the Viet Cong were scary? Look at our guy!The film has a semi-documentary feel. It contrasts sunny Marseilles with chilly New York; the scenes of surveillance feel gritty and real. And that music is so right for the visuals. Don Ellis' score gets going with the urgent Main Titles theme. Then short, distinctive notes announce a number of scenes; the music stays in the memory,Could ""The French Connection"" be made the same way today? Probably not. It does have diversity, but not in the way intended these days. Ethnic groups do appear in the movie all introduced by Popeye by their derogatory slang terms.With that said though, in cinematic terms, if there is a benchmark for the genre, ""The French Connection"" is still it.",The French Connection
86,sme_no_densetsu,"""Do you pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?""",8,25 December 2009,"William Friedkin's ""The French Connection"" is a classic cop drama and the recipient of the Best Picture Oscar for 1971. In it, a pair of hard-nosed New York cops discover a heroin smuggling scheme using a French connection. What follows is the fictionalized account of detectives 'Popeye' Doyle & 'Cloudy' Russo pursuing the criminals in an attempt to bring them to justice.While the story may not be as novel today it is nevertheless well told and feels authentic. The film contains considerable action, including one of the most celebrated chase scenes in film. It is also worth noting that the script by Ernest Tidyman won an Oscar.Gene Hackman & Roy Scheider fit their characters well and turn in convincing performances. Hackman won an Oscar for his efforts while Scheider landed a nomination. Fernando Rey is also notable in his role as a high-class French smuggler.Friedkin's Oscar-winning direction is well done and the film's editing also landed an Oscar. The cinematography & sound also received nominations but I'm surprised that the Don Ellis score received no attention. It really goes a long way in setting the right tone for the film, particularly at the beginning & end.As for the film's Best Picture win, I wouldn't necessarily say that it was undeserved but 1971 was a tough year. I think that either ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""The Last Picture Show"" would have been better choices. That being said, ""The French Connection"" is indeed a cut above the usual cop flick so I do not hesitate to recommend it.",The French Connection
87,frankde-jong,More than just a spectacular chasing scene,8,2 June 2020,"""The French connection"" is mostly known for the spectacular chasing scene between a car and a subway train. The scene was shot ""on location"", that is to say in the middle of real traffic, and this seems real irresponsible (and so it maybe was). By cutting the scene in small fragments and using smart editing and also by using innovative lenses the images look more dangerous than they really were (but nonetheless).I am not a great fan of chasing scenes, so for me this scene was not the main attraction of the movie. In a way I think that this scene is ""a curse in disguise"" because it takes out of sight the many other strong points of ""The French connection"".One strong point is the young Gene Hackman, who plays the New York cop Jimmy Doyle. Jimmy is as immoral as the small time crooks he is dealing with. He is coarse mouthed and a genuine racist. His career needs the catch of a big fish, and one day he catches rumors about a big heroine shipment from France, expected anytime soon. It is funny to see Doyle tracing his ""big fish"" (Alain Charnier played by Fernando Rey). Doyle outside with a pizza slice, Charnier inside with a luxurious three coarse meal.The second strong point is the city of New York. In the '70 New York went through a crisis and it took an upturn of the economy and three strong mayors (Koch, Giuliani and Bloomberg) to bring the city on top again. New York city in ""The French connection"" is messy, smudgy and very cold (the story is situated in the winter). The images of New York are a long way from the declaration of love to the city that Woody Allen made with ""Manhattan"" (1979). Nevertheless these smudgy images give the film a certain amount of charm and a nearly documentary look and feel, which is kind of appropriate because the film is based on real live characters.In sharp contrast to this documentary look and feel is the ending, which is situated in a kind of post apocalytical factory building. Even Bela Tarr can not shoot images that are more desolate. In this environment the main charachter of the film just disappears in the dark.",The French Connection
88,PimpinAinttEasy,My third favorite William Friedkin film,8,30 March 2016,"Dear William Friedkin, The French Connection was a really gritty crime drama with the cops and drug sellers playing hide and seek in the backdrop of New York. Gene Hackman is tough and menacing as the alcoholic and lecherous cop. Roy Scheider's sober cop is a perfect foil and sidekick for Hackman's Popeye. Fernado Rey's high life as a sophisticated drug supplier is placed parallel to the low life of the two cops but their stories do intersect once in a while. The film looked a lot like a documentary. The visuals were stark and moody and there was hardly any light in many of the scenes. The editing was best described by you yourself, William. You said as an audience, you never knew what the next cut was going to be. The first running chase and Hackman's car chase of his potential assassin were both thrilling. Anurag Kashyap overdid it in Black Friday. This is my third favorite film directed by you, after The Exorcist and The Sorcerer. Best Regards, Pimpin. (8/10)",The French Connection
89,seymourblack-1,A Groundbreaking Classic,9,5 June 2013,"Prior to its release, few people could've anticipated the impact that ""The French Connection"" would make. Not only did it clean up at the Oscars and effectively launch the careers of William Friedkin, Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider but it also achieved a new level of realism which influenced so many of the crime thrillers that were made in its wake. The story of two tough New York City narcotics detectives who try to bring down an international drugs ring is also compelling because it's based on actual events and the way that they're portrayed looks so convincing.Extensive use of hand-held cameras and location shots contribute to the production's documentary style and the run down areas of the city that provide the backdrop for some of the action reinforce the movie's depressing bleakness and grittiness.One night, Detective Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner Detective Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) are at a nightclub when Doyle notices a group of known mobsters at one of the tables. Doyle doesn't know one of the characters and persuades Russo that they should tail the mystery man who turns out to be Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco). It soon becomes evident that Boca, who's a small businessman, enjoys a lifestyle which his legitimate activities could not support and their suspicions about him deepen further when he visits the residence of a drug financier called Joel Weinstock (Harold Gary).Shortly after, one of Doyle's informants tells him about a major shipment of heroin that's due to arrive at New York harbour and the two detectives arrange for Boca's telephone to be tapped.French mastermind Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) arranges for the huge quantity of top class heroin to be transported from Marseilles to New York in a car belonging to French TV personality Henri Devereaux (Frederic de Pasquale) and Charnier and his henchman Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) arrive in New York in time to watch Devereaux's car being lowered from the ship onto the wharf. Doyle and Russo keep the Frenchmen under surveillance and what follows soon develops into an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse which eventually comes to a conclusion when a meeting of all the participants in the drugs deal is gate-crashed by Doyle, Russo and a large number of other police officers and a couple of federal agents.Doyle's character fascinated audiences who, at that time, weren't used to seeing cops who were so foul mouthed, bigoted and unprincipled. This man was driven by an obsessive need to hunt down the criminals but in so doing, completely ignored the rules under which he was authorised to operate and showed no concern for innocent people who were hurt or killed directly or indirectly because of his actions. Gene Hackman is terrific as the incredibly cold and callous rogue cop whose methods and values are extremely troubling.The quality of the acting in this film is consistently good but the contribution of Fernando Rey merits a special mention because he brings a level of humour and sophistication to the drama which provides such a strong and welcome contrast to Doyle's behaviour.The most famous feature of ""The French Connection"" is the very tense and exciting car chase that follows when Nicoli tries to escape on an elevated train after attempting to shoot Doyle. Doyle commandeers a car from a member of the public and then chases the train at high speed. The whole sequence is brilliantly executed and predictably, there are numerous near misses and car damaging moments along the way.Overall, this groundbreaking classic is a movie that's not to be missed.",The French Connection

There are two things about this movie that are flat out tops - 1) the NYC street scenes are so real you can smell them; and 2) the subway vs Pontiac chase scene (with kudos to Bill Hickman, who also appears as a federal agent).

92,TheUnknown837-1,"It's gritty, it's suspenseful, it's disturbing, it's powerful...it's a great film",10,5 April 2007,"While Gene Hackman may despise being in violent films (and maybe even winning an Academy Award for his performance in them), I cannot deny that it is in that genre that he really pulls off his greatest performances and ""The French Connection"" is the film that started his career, making him a national celebrity.In the first twenty minutes or so of ""The French Connection"", I was beginning to wonder if maybe the film was going to be a bit racist. Because at first, it seemed like the director was trying to make African Americans seem like drug addicts, troublemakers, and no-good citizens. But as the film evolved, so did my opinions on it and I realized it wasn't a racist movie at all. It wasn't even trying to make French people look hostile or dangerous. Of course, it doesn't symbolize anything, either, but it's still not doing any harm to anybody.The action of ""The French Connection"" is breathtaking. The film features what I consider the greatest car chase scene ever as Hackman trails after an assassin hired to take him down. There are also a few gunfights and shootouts throughout the movie, all of which are powerful and amazing. The ending was a bit of a surprise to me and maybe for some people, a bit unsatisfying, but it worked out for the kind of movie that ""The French Connection"" is.",The French Connection
93,mstomaso,A masterpiece of NYC hard-edged realism,10,29 April 2005,"This is an intense, unremitting, intelligent and incredibly fast-paced film which blends action, cinematic realism, art and humor into a masterwork of hard-edged crime drama. But to categorize this film as drama, suspense or action really does violence to it. This is just a great film, and it doesn't fit comfortably into any category with which I am aware. Don't look here for any sense of fantasy-justice or n'er-do-wrong comic book heroism. Look here instead for gut wrenching nihilism, frustration with the unfairness of criminal justice in the hands of bureaucracy, and a solid, plot-driven story about a couple of cops who are just trying to do their jobs as best they can.And by all means, don't watch this film if you aren't fully awake and willing to be taken down the electric, ambiguous, and compelling roads it leads to. If you watch this film with any part of your brain turned off you'll end up asking questions like ""plot, what plot?"" The fact that some people can't find it reflects more on them as film-watchers than it does on this film. This film does not offer passive entertainment like most of the contemporary action market does. It makes you pay attention, though, at times you might not want to. Hackman and Scheider are incredible, with some of the greatest chemistry I have ever seen between two young actors. They play two hard-ass NYC detectives looking to end the war on drugs more-or-less permanently by taking down an international conspiracy which they have just barely sniffed out. And make no mistake, they, particularly Hackman's ""Popeye Doyle"" are at war, and treat their jobs as a battlefield. Doyle pursues his quarry with utterly wreckless abandon, endangering the lives of dozens of people along the way. While both men are absolutely terrific, this stands out as one of Hackman's greatest performances, and his Oscar is well-deserved (not something you will see me say often). Backed by a strong supporting cast, and some of the best live-action cinematography of the late 20th century, this film does not allow you to turn away, get popcorn, or even deal with bodily functions for its entire duration.Considered in the early 70s to be 'shockingly violent', this film does not even reach a tenth the degree of passive violent repulsion of the average Tarantino film, and it relies, instead, on amazing performances, flawless direction, a phenomenal post-modern soundtrack and edgy, tense camera-work. Unlike contemporary action film garbage, it also gives you complex characters who you can care about, but never fully understand. I will cut this review short because I am running out of superlatives. Anybody remotely interested in expanding or just appreciating the artistic breadth and depth of mainstream film needs to see this.",The French Connection
94,brchthethird,They don't make 'em like this anymore,8,14 November 2014,"THE FRENCH CONNECTION is a superb crime drama with an excellent central performance by Gene Hackman. He plays Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, a no-nonsense, obsessive narc who is on the trail of a suspected drug dealer with connections from France (hence, the title). What struck me immediately was the was gritty, verite-style cinematography and hand-held camera-work. It perfectly fits the subject matter and helps add a sense of realism. Of course, one should mention Gene Hackman's brilliant lead performance. He plays Doyle as an cop who is obsessive about his job, and perhaps too much so. Even while having a drink with his partner after work, he manages to snoop around and people-watch, casing the place and looking for any suspicious activity. Granted his life isn't all work, but it's mostly work. There was also indication that his dedication has produced negative results in the past, so this also works as a portrait of a man on the edge. He's a man with drive, but not always pointed in the right direction. Still, he feels very strongly that the case he's working on is something big. Roy Scheider does a fine job as his partner, but no other character is given near the amount of attention or development as Doyle. Also worthy of mention is a spectacular chase sequence, which was apparently filmed guerrilla style (really, most of the movie feels that way, to its credit). It was thrilling to watch, and is one of the best I'm seen committed to film. There were also many other great, tense moments, but that one stood out for being the ballsiest. And really, the pace of the movie never lets up. It's a fast ride from start to finish. Overall, I was very impressed with the look and feel of the film, as well as the fine character work by Gene Hackman. It does feel a little creaky in a few spots, but nothing that ruins the picture. I heartily recommend this to anyone who enjoys a great thrill-ride.",The French Connection

96,hall895,Best Picture? Really?,4,10 June 2008,"The French Connection won five Academy Awards including best picture. Must not have been a very good year for movies. Because ""best"" is certainly not a word I would associate with this movie. This movie is slow, dull and full of contrivances that will insult your intelligence. Let's have our ""hero"" cops completely strip a car looking for drugs. Well, completely strip it except we'll leave just one part intact. Because after we've torn the whole car apart and found nothing the drugs couldn't possibly be hidden in that one remaining part could they? Sigh.Anyhow, the threadbare plot here involves a couple of New York City narcotics cops investigating a shipment of drugs coming into the city from France. The movie immediately establishes who the bad guys are and exactly how their smuggling operation works so there's no mystery here. This is no whodunit. We know who the bad guys are, the cops know who the bad guys are and then...nothing. The bad guys drive around the city and the cops follow them. For an occasional change of pace the bad guys get out of their cars and walk around the city...and the cops follow them. Not a whole lot of anything going on here. Until THAT scene. The ""greatest chase scene ever"". Well, you call it greatest if you want, I'll call it completely ludicrous. First off anyone driving like our ""hero"" through the streets of New York would have gotten himself killed about 37 times over during this chase. And innocent bystanders would certainly have been plowed over as well. But forgetting all that the whole chase is completely unnecessary because our ""hero"" is chasing a subway train. Which of course is on tracks. Which means it's only going one place. Which means any cop with half a brain would simply have called for backup and had officers sent to all the stations along the route. Did he think the train was going to make a sudden, unexpected turn and head for Poughkeepsie? Our ""hero"" cop risked lives for what? For nothing. This completely illogical scene exists for no reason other than to have an exciting scene in the movie. Which I guess is understandable because this movie was sorely lacking exciting scenes. But this scene ends up being much more laughable than exciting.Gene Hackman does pretty well in his role as obsessive, abrasive, bigoted cop Popeye Doyle who you get the sense is always a moment away from completely losing his mind. It's a pretty interesting character in a film mostly devoid of interesting characters. Playing Doyle's much more reserved partner Roy Scheider doesn't get to chew scenery like Hackman. Scheider's character is much more believable if not particularly compelling. This film's problems don't lie with its two lead performers. Hackman and Scheider were fine. It's everything around them which disappoints.",The French Connection
97,CitizenCaine,Groundbreaking French Connection Set Trend,10,1 August 2009,"Gene Hackman (Oscar winner as Best Actor) became a star with William Friedkin's (Oscar winner as Best Director) The French Connection (Oscar winner as Best Picture), the story of a New York narcotic's detective, Eddie Egan, who almost single-handedly brought down an international drug smuggling ring with his partner Sonny Grosso. From his ravenous appetite and drinking binges to his rumpled appearance and thuggish amoral behavior on the streets, Hackman played ""Popeye"" Doyle in a way that revealed Doyle to be an exciting cop but mostly unlikeable as a person. Roy Scheider (Oscar-nominated as Best Supporting Actor) played ""Cloudy"" Russo, the Sonny Grosso character, in a way that revealed Doyle and Russo worked as well as peanut butter and jelly together. Doyle's hard-edged, tyrannical character was tamed by Russo's more calm and sensible approach.Doyle, played by Hackman, is contrasted with chief villain Alain Charnier, played by Fernando Rey, throughout the film in a manner making Charnier seem like a nice guy and Doyle repugnant. Doyle appears to be rumpled while Charnier is well dressed. Doyle is excitable while Charnier is collected. Doyle eats and drinks like a common man while Charnier eats like a gourmet critic. Doyle speaks in intimidating fashion while Charnier sounds confident and educated. The personality contrast is visually highlighted in the famous subway car scene where Charnier outwits Doyle and escapes being followed.Those who feel Doyle's character was simply a groundbreaking characterization of a tough cop need to take another look at the film. During the second half of the film especially, Doyle became more and more amoral, socio-pathic, and obsessed with bagging Charnier. He nearly started a brawl with his own guys when reminded that a cop got killed as a result of one of his previous hunches; he drove with reckless abandon under the elevated train, almost killing or severely injuring several civilians; and of course at the film's shocking conclusion, he had no remorse and didn't miss a beat in continuing to pursue Charnier when things went awry.In addition to the obvious contrasts in character between the unlikable Doyle and the suave Charnier, the hard-edged realism of New York City served as the perfect backdrop in a film with no art and set decoration and no artificial lighting. Friedkin used natural lighting throughout the film, which is a wonder in and of itself considering the film was made during a bleak, cold, and dreary winter in New York City. The crew used hand-held cameras on the streets with no tracking or dolly shots evident throughout, as many scenes were filmed without obtaining permits and the proper endorsements from local officials. This maverick style enabled filmmakers to capture a street hockey game with neighborhood kids at night, actors conducting surveillance on the streets of New York amongst numerous passersby, and certainly one of the most hair-raising car chases ever filmed. The action unfolds in realistic and documentary-like fashion throughout the film, framing the police procedural: stakeout, payoff, chase(s), and shootout. The gritty dialog modeled on Egan's and Grosso's conversations, a police detective with multiple negative character traits, the cat and mouse game where the pursuer winds up being pursued, the fact the film was shot in a bitterly cold winter, and the concluding location in an abandoned bakery warehouse all add to the film's realism. With Doyle's and Russo's world full of many real life foibles and obstacles, The French Connection further deglamorized the world of crime and police the public may have known through the advent of television and the plethora of police shows during the 1960's leading up to the time of the film's release.Ernest Tidyman supposedly wrote the script reportedly with a contribution from Howard Hawks of all people, but Friedkin later indicated little, if any, of Tidyman's script was actually used. The film was based on the book written by Robin Moore and the uncredited Edward M. Keyes, but Friedkin formulated most of the action around conversations he observed with and had with Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso. Amazingly, the film won an Oscar for its screenplay making the old adage ""writers can't improve the real thing"" seem true. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards total, including its cinematography, editing, and sound. Owen Roizman's cinematography utilized natural lighting and real locations. Jerry Greenberg's deliberately paced editing won an Oscar for its fast-paced street portrayal of the cat and mouse game between police and drug smugglers and the terrific Hackman car chase scene. The most recognizable use of a cello in a film since Psycho coupled with the natural sounds of New York City street life made the soundtrack less obtrusive than most. These elements all contributed to the realism Friedkin deftly depicted. As a result, the film contributed to the proliferation of more realistic crime dramas in the cinema and on television in the 1970's. **** of 4 stars.",The French Connection
98,aciessi,Drive Angry,8,25 June 2015,"The first 20 minutes or so play out like a typical, early 70's, bust-a-pimp exploitation flick, and I thought I wasn't going to like it. But then, it all gloriously changed. A 180 degree turn-around, into what I think is one of the most nail-biting crime thrillers of all time. The French Connection is a ticket into the mind of a ragtag cop, trying to make his day with the case of his life. We spend most of the film, following him as he shadows the criminals he is chasing. It's classic cinema verite. We see every sudden movement and action in this cat and mouse chase. Climaxing with the unparalleled, jaw-dropping, chase scene, above and below the train station.

99,Stampsfightclub,Wonderfully real crime drama,8,19 August 2009,"Detective Jimmy Doyle (Hackman) begins an investigation into the supposed dealings of a big drugs deal.Winner of 5 Oscars and officially the first picture with an 18/R certificate to win the coveted prize, the legendary The French Connection has sparked hefty conversations and still remains as strongly realistic and powerful almost 40 years on.Gene Hackman's Oscar winning leading role is as perfectly hard and edgy as you want for a tough nut cop who is out to prove his point. The bravado and swagger of the Bonnie and Clyde actor is a scene stealer that generates that great feeling of tension and action, complete male adrenaline that adds tension and spice to a well depicted plot.The plot centres on Doyle's suspicions about a couple of unusual looking guys behaving strangely. After debating this with his chief the real action starts as Popeye and Cloudy pursue the bad guys. The interesting aspect of this close observation is that it is built completely around speculation rather that hard core evidence and therein lies the deep meaning of this film, what is behind closed doors so to speak. The passion and drama denoted through the debates and speculation adds to the tension within the force and adds a spice to the drama amongst the heavy crime ideologies.As the tension and the forgettable bad beginning subside does the film settle down with a moderate stakeout and more conversational scenes but then the action picks up with the numerous inclusions of car chases, heavy deception and a finale to remember.The big car chase was one of the most renowned when filmed in the early 70's. Taking an apparent 5 weeks to get accurate, the chase sees Hackman taking a small wound from a sniper and following the assassin as the mystery man gets on a train and Hackman steals an unsuspecting guy's car, much like he does in Enemy of the state only with more passion and excitement.As the train flies overhead we see Popeye diverting the traffic and speeding through lights, past the oblivious road users in determination to get his first proper hold on the case. This chase is certainly remarkable as the close calls and shifting camera angles really add to the realism of the moment, in contrast to some of the obviously staged Bond chases. With as much action and intrigue as the Bourne chases, this is a highlight.Regarding the French mastermind there is a finely staged deception on the train station when the on and off hopping proves to be more than deceiving the other. It is a highly contested battle of minds and a wonderful wave to finish off the sharp war.The ending is sharp and so sudden you can't believe it. With an accidental shot and a montage of the after effects, the French connection rounds off in a sharp and realistic way, makes this a true crime with wonderful acting and charisma.",The French Connection
100,gab-14712,Gene Hackman's Show!,8,18 October 2017,"I remember watching The French Connection for the first time several years ago. I knew people regarded it as an instant classic, so I was expecting to love it. But the power of subjectivity appeared, and it turned out I didn't like it all too much. In discussions with cinema lovers, I was lambasted because people see this as one of the all-time greats. I watched this for a second time recently, and how about that! My opinion changed. While not calling this film an all-time great, I do respect and like it very much. The film fits the definition of a 70's American film. It is dark, gritty, and features some heavy violence. Also, the film happens to be home of one of cinema's greatest car chases. Essentially, the movie is a giant chase but that particular car chase is something else. I'll discuss it more later on in this review.This Oscar-winning film takes us onto the streets of New York City following two detectives, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider). Popeye is infamous for taking in street-level drug dealers, and at best his policework can be described as shady. He's violent drunk cop with low ethical standards, and his career is rapidly falling apart. But he seizes his biggest opportunity when he learns of a huge heroin shipment coming from France. Now we have an interesting contrast between Popeye and the heroin smuggler, Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey). I just mentioned Popeye has low moral standards, but he still is a dedicated cop. On the other hand, Charnier is a smooth gentleman that no one can predict he is a criminal. Now the standoff between the two men begins when Popeye does all he can to bring Charnier in.Now going back to that car chase! It was a wonderfully executed car chase and what I like is that it is all real. There was an actual chase filmed in Brooklyn exactly how you see it on screen. It's crazy too because the chase is about a simple car trying to outrun and outmaneuver a moving train which eventually has a dead conductor at the wheel. So then it turns into a psychologically-crazy man versus machine kind of chase. The chase also proves the recklessness of Popeye. He held no regard for the common people as he had close calls with them during the chase. He was basically using the people for his benefit.in an oddly positive way. Some of the camera techniques are very effective. They filmed in a way where the subjects are actually further away from the cars than shown on screen.which must have been a relief for some of the actors. But yes, this is one of the biggest car chases to have ever been filmed so this film is a must-see just for that.Speaking of actors, well yes let's talk about the acting. Director William Friedkin famously did not want Gene Hackman in the lead role. Hackman, by 1971 was already a bankable star, but Friedkin did not think so. Luckily, they decided to cast Hackman anyway and it's a good thing they did. Hackman is one of those actors who can do any genre and always gives his best effort. I loved his performance here and his character was perhaps the only three-dimensional character in the film because the film spends so much time on him. But I was won over by Hackman almost right away. The scene where he enters a bar and violently asks everyone to turn out their pockets in the search for drugs-well, I knew I would be in for a treat. I was happy to see his performance win Best Actor at the Academy Awards. Roy Scheider does a solid job as Popeye's partner, but I didn't feel the same way for him as I did for Popeye. There was nothing much to do for him except to act as a backup. Same goes for Fernando Rey. A very solid performance, but his character was also under-utilized.The French Connection is a violent, fast-paced film. I said in my opening the movie plays like one giant chase, but I liked the frenetic pacing of the movie. My favorite scene is no doubt that car chase, but I loved the smaller scenes especially the ones where Popeye is up to no good. I also loved the actual photography of the film. Sure, the movie is over forty years old but seeing the streets of my favorite city in the world always makes me happy as it brings back some fond memories. The film has a violent nature and it may take you by surprise, but this film is heralded by many as an instant classic. I may not think so, but I did enjoy it very much.My Grade: B+",The French Connection

102,agmoldham,Do you pick your feet ?,7,23 December 2003,"One of the best films of the 70's The French Connection was very bold at the time. I used to work for the police and there's some officers you just know would be crooks if they weren't in the force. This is very much true of 'Popeye' (Hackman) and to a lesser extent Russo (Scheider). A great script, brilliant performance from Hackman, ably supported by the rest of the cast, and excellent direction from Friedkin make this a standout movie. You can always recognise a great movie by how many people recognise quotes and the ""Do You pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?"" must be high on the list of memorable movie quotes.",The French Connection
103,ajs-10,"Gritty, realistic & great!",9,12 April 2011,"I saw this film many many years ago, I thought it was good, but I don't think I really appreciated it as much as I did this time around. It won five Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actor for Gene Hackman and Best Director for William Friedkin. A gritty movie with no punches pulled, it really grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until it's finished I loved it! More of my thoughts later, after this brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please track down that guy taking pot-shots at Popeye Doyle while I write the next paragraph).Two hard-boiled cops, Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle and Det. Buddy Russo are on the narcotics trail. The word on the street is that there's a big shipment coming in soon, but they don't know where from. Meanwhile, in France, Alain Charnier, is planning a trip to New York. Doyle and Russo get lucky and lock onto Sal Boca, an ambitious low-life who just happens to have made the connection with some French suppliers. He is watched constantly and even the F.B.I. are brought in on the surveillance. Eventually he makes contact and the cops now have more people to follow Some of which are very dangerous indeed. Will they be able to stop the deal going through? Well, I'm not going to tell you that here Doyle says he's gonna slam my head against a wall if I do.As I said at the beginning, this film is gritty, no fancy sets, it's all filmed on location. It all looks, and feels, very real which adds to the excitement of the chase scenes, which are all very well done by the way. I can see why it won so many awards, there's something very compelling about it that's hard to define. None of the characters are particularly likable, but that doesn't matter, what matters is getting those bad guys.Very much an Oscar-worthy performance from Gene Hackman as Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, ably supported by Roy Scheider as Det. Buddy Russo. Also worthy of note was Fernando Rey as Alain Charnier. Add to this some great stunts, a decent soundtrack and one of the iconic chase sequences (if you've seen it you'll know the one I mean). I really enjoyed this one, not just for it's gritty realism, but also because it's a very well made film Highly recommended.My Score: 8.7/10",The French Connection

I don't know about the Best Picture award, but it deserves the other four Oscars that it got: Best Actor (Gene Hackman), Best Director (William Friedkin), Best Film Editing and Best Picture. The cinematography is also superb.Gene Hackman plays Popeye Doyle, a New York narcotic detective working on the bust of his career. With a nose for the job, he get things done quickly and uses non-orthodox ways most of the time. The scene where he's behind the wheel chasing an urban train is just great. So is the one where Hackman is playing cat and mouse with Fernando Rey's character. The stakeout scenes where the cops are waiting for the dealers to make their next move are fantastic. You can really feel the tension going on.Great film. I gave it 85 out of 100. That's ***½ on a four stars ranking.",The French Connection

The French Connection was a godsend for him. Popeye Doyle is an icon of the cinema, with his cool hat and coat, tailing some scumbag down a New York street, or face full of anger, yelling at a bunch of lowlifes.The shaky (but no too shaky) camerawork and lack of bells and whistles really takes us into this gritty urban environment and makes it feel so authentic.The French Connection is an exhilirating experience - surely one of the best action movies i've ever seen.10/10",The French Connection
106,tonypeacock-1,"Entertaining, aged to perfection perhaps...",7,5 January 2017,"I had never seen this much lauded movie from 1971 about New York City police detectives intercepting a heroin shipment from France.The first thing that struck me when watching the film was the grimness of 1970s New York City, its highways, streets and subway are excellently captured by the director with its sounds of street horns replacing the need for a soundtrack.The main characters are police officers Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his slightly younger partner Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider). Hackman and Scheider both look so young when I consider there later roles in films such as Jaws (Scheider) and the Superman franchise (Hackman).Popeye (not the cartoon character!) is an overtly racist, streetwise cop whilst Russo is the calming influence in the partnership! The drug side is led by Marseilles entrepreneur Charnier (Fernando Rey), the late Spanish Rey is perhaps best known for his work on some of Luis Buñuel films and has a filmography as big as anyone!Tony Lo Bianco who I only watched last week in the cult classic The Honeymoon Killers also has a role.The grime of New York is contrasted with the opulence of Marseilles and a brief scene in Washington DC. A chase sequence featuring a gas guzzling car of the era against an overhead Subway train is memorable for its editing and realism.The film won Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Actor (Hackman) and editing Oscars. Whilst good I don't actually rate it as good as Dirty Harry starring Clint Eastwood. Again perhaps its is the grime of a cold, winter New York versus the relative sunshine of San Francisco?Also the film ends pretty downbeat with drugs being smuggled into New York via a Lincoln car, Charnier escaping the law and a ruined building scene.",The French Connection
107,RonellSowes,Mature take on the genre,8,4 December 2020,"The French Connection is one of the grittiest and more realistic police detective dramas out there.While highly fictionalized,the film tries to depict the actual life and work of a police detective which is so often misrepresented in most movies. The film has a subdued pace and lets the plot unfold slowly-never trying to build excitement in the peppy style most cop movies do. There isn't a whole lot of action in the film besides the brief shootout at the end and a couple of chase sequences,most memorably the one with the Doyle driving after the train. Generally car chases are an overused,boring,cheap way to get a thrill utilized by nearly every single action flick but the one in The French Connection is actually entertaining for once. The entire sequence has a very claustrophobic feel to it as Popyeye narrowly swerves between cars and pedestrians trying to follow the train above;interspaced with silent shots of his reactions.
Gene Hackman won a well deserved Best Actor Oscar for his performance as Popeye Doyle. The film was nominated in eight categories of which it won five including Best Picture,Director and Adapted Screenplay.The French Connection isn't your typical glamorized,non stop action police movie. It's a mature,hardheaded take on the genre with it's own unique appeal.",The French Connection

I'm not going to pretend that this is some sort of masterpiece. Though it is basically another ""generic action flick"", the twists that they add to it make it worth watching. The way they incorporate the plot into the movie is fun and original, and though the actors don't really ""act"" in it, it's a lot of fun to watch. It has a few suspenseful plot elements, and the way they incorporate it all together is cool. It's a film that fails to take advantage of its cool premise, that makes you wish they had done better rather than spoiling a good idea.

109,perfectbond,Somewhat overrated,7,21 March 2003,"Based on the reputation of this movie and being a big Gene Hackman fan, I expected great things when I watched The French Connection on DVD recently. I was a bit disappointed. I'm sure the movie was phenomenonally groundbreaking at the time of its release, but having just watched it, the film felt stale a little too often for my liking. Gene Hackman is superb as would be expected, but he didn't seem to have to expand his range too much in this role. I'm surprised he won an Oscar for this role (I'm astonished the film won Best Picture). The famous car chase justified its legend for me and there was also a memorable chase between Doyle and the lead French mobster on the streets and subway but other then that the film felt quite generic. Still above average entertainment, 7/10.",The French Connection

But Dirty Harry was more smooth and poised. It's hero was cool and wore shades. The French Connection was dark and gritty. Not that Dirty Harry wasn't also dark and gritty, because it clearly was. But whereas Harry Callahan could be ruthless when he needed to be, Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) was ruthless constantly. The shaky camera work also heightens the realism. Whether Doyle is chasing someone on foot or by car it holds you in. This was one of Hackman's first starring roles and it's certainly become one of his most famous. Roy Scheider (in a pre Jaws role) is also great as Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo, Doyle's right hand man. The French Connection is a must see for anyone. Check it out.",The French Connection
111,RJBurke1942,The gritty streets of New York never looked better.,8,8 September 2010,"Today, this movie would be made with a bunch of computers, and using a bunch of green rooms in which the actors would go through their paces.Thankfully, 1971 was still the time that action movies were made on location, in real cities, with real people, and real auto chases – the works. And, boyo, does it work! Thirty-eight years after seeing this one in a cinema, there's no doubt that this story and production deserve the Oscars and kudos that were lavished upon it. At the time I saw it, I was so taken with the story, I read the book also. Truth, after all, is always better than fiction.From the narrative perspective, it's a humdrum story about two of NY's finest making a drug bust of heroin imported from France. What sets it apart from other run-of-the-mill cop thrillers is, first, the acting from Best Actor Award Gene Hackman (as Popeye Doyle) and Roy Scheider (as Buddy Russo); second, the photography and editing (also an Academy Award for the latter); third, the script by Ernest Tidyman (another Academy Award); and finally, the direction from William Friedkin (yet another Academy Award). The icing on this cake was the Oscar for Best Picture, and well deserved, in my opinion.Much has been written about the chase sequence where Doyle grabs a citizen's auto to chase after a train on the el in which a French killer is trying to escape capture – a sequence that took five days to complete, so I read here in the trivia section. For thrills, and for today's audience, the only comparable chase sequence is the one Paul Greengrass staged in The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). That from Bullitt (1968), while ground breaking and very good, doesn't quite match up as thrilling or as frenetic.The visual story-telling is at its best, however, with the sequences shot to show Doyle, Russo and other agents crisscrossing New York streets on foot and in cars, trying to stay with the two main villains from France as they lead the coppers on a merry-go-round: very sparse dialog, much inter-cutting, reverse shots and so on made it a production and editing nightmare – but also a terrific sequence that keeps the viewer on the edge.The most amazing aspect, for me, is that the real operation occurred because the two real cops in the middle of it all stumbled upon the whole deal. Without that stroke of luck, there would never have been a French Connection. And, a lot of people would never have won the awards they did. Ain't life strange? And, now you also can be rewarded when you see this film, still at #154 of the 250 all-time great movies. And if you want to see a young Gene Hackman, it's a better role than as Buck Barrow in Bonnie & Clyde (1967), I can assure you. And a better movie.Highly recommended.",The French Connection

Loosely based on a real-life heroin-smuggling case, it could have made for a good movie if it showed what actually happened. Instead, they have a ""hero"" who is just a remorseless thug with a badge, a cookie-cutter car chase scene, and most ridiculous of all, a scene where somehow the police department garage mechanics are able to take a car apart completely and put it back together completely in a few hours! The only memorable scene is where the main villain tricks the policeman by using the handle of his umbrella to prevent the subway train doors from closing momentarily, fooling the policeman into thinking he stepped off and then riding away. (This incident did happen in the real-life case.) If only they depicted how the real case was.

Its fundamental nugacity results from two conflicting, self-cancelling urges - the austere, European, Melville-like gangster film, that privileges form and metaphysics over character and place, and the American action drama that emphasises said character and place.

And, this one is a lot like The Offence (1973) where the cop is ""deteriorating"" (""Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster.."".) and have given it a 9 for noir.

124,romanorum1,Gritty Urban Thriller about Drug-Busting Cops,9,17 December 2013,"After tailing a chap in Marseilles, France, a mousy man is shot in the face by a thug. We learn later that the dead man was a French undercover cop. In Brooklyn, NY, a man dressed up as Santa Claus and another one in plain clothes chase down an obvious drug pusher and rough him up. After the pusher knifes the plainclothesman in the hand, the Santa Claus says, ""Never trust a n****r!"" ""He could have been white,"" responds the wounded man. In the background is a spray-painted sign that reads ""Negro Power."" We learn that the two men are narcotics officers; the dominant one (Santa Claus) is ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) while the passive man is ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Schneider). Doyle, obsessed and to all appearances driven by hatred, brashly emits ethnic slurs like ""n****r,"" ""greaser,"" ""frog,"" ""spic,"" and ""dago."" On a hunch and after surveying the nightclub activities including a drug-drop involving Sal Boca (Tony Lo Bianco), the two undercover cops tail him and his female companion to Sal and Angie's small luncheonette in ""dago-town."" There is no way that the luncheonette can support Sal's expensive lifestyle. Later we are introduced to another individual, a bigger fish named Joel Weinstock, the money man. Doyle and Russo then leave, enter a bar in a black neighborhood, and shake down the bar patrons. Popeye's actions are way over the top: haughty, patronizing, and self-righteous. He shows no mercy or understanding. Then he singles out a patron he dubs ""Haircut"" (Afro-style) and takes him to a private area of the bar. Only then do we discover that ""Haircut"" is undercover. To make the situation look good, Popeye slugs him, and does it with extra exuberance. ""Haircut"" did tip off Popeye that a drug shipment is expected within a week or two. So about a half-hour into the film we see the French connection, Marseilles to Brooklyn. There will be more clues.French movie star Devereaux (Frederic de Pasquale) is assisting Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), the French drug lord, because he needs cash. Meanwhile Popeye and Cloudy convince their superior Walt Simonson (Eddie Egan, the real Popeye Doyle) that they are onto something with drug kingpin Weinstock and underling Boca. Walt agrees with wiretapping Boca, and also gives Doyle and Russo BNDD (Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs) cops Bill Mulderig (Bill Hickman) and Bill Klein (played by Sonny Grosso, the real ""Cloudy"" Russo). Bill Mulderig hates Popeye and his hunches and makes no effort to disguise his feelings. Before long the four lawmen tail Boca, who meets with Charnier and his henchman Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi). They discover Charnier's apartment on the fourth floor of the Westbury Hotel (the Roosevelt), where Howard the Chemist tells Weinstock that the heroin shipment is 89% pure, worth a fortune. Leaving the hotel, Charnier is tailed by Doyle, setting up one of the film's two exciting chase sequences. Charnier eludes Doyle on a subway and waves goodbye. Charnier now allows Pierre Nicoli to assassinate Doyle. But the French henchman misses his shots and seriously wounds a female bystander instead. Doyle spots the Frenchman on a rooftop and takes off after him, setting up the second of the film's fine chases. Nicoli hops onto an elevated train while Doyle, commandeering a Pontiac LeMans below, must travel at high speeds to keep up with the EL. As the city is congested, there are crashes and near-misses: very disturbing situations as the reckless Doyle is totally consumed by his job to win at all costs. At the time, this five-minute auto chase was considered one of the two greatest in cinema history; the other was the ten-minute job in ""Bullitt"" (1968). Doyle does much better with the henchman than he did with Charnier. The famous ""French Connection"" movie poster shows him plugging the Frenchman in the back on the staircase. Later Doyle and Russo check out Charnier's Lincoln. ""That car's dirty, Cloudy. We're going to sit here all night if we have to."" They eventually find 120 pounds of heroin hidden in the rocker panels, a street value in the millions. At the end there is a shoot-out in an abandoned factory building. Although most of the bad guys are captured or killed, Charnier somehow escapes. The amoral Doyle accidentally kills Bill Mulderig and expresses not an ounce of remorse. After the shooting, Doyle and Russo are transferred out of the Narcotic's Bureau and reassigned. The ending screen comments illustrate that those captured received light sentences.""The French Connection"" is well-directed, fast-paced, and realistic. It certainly catches the flavor of New York and has interesting sets. Note the scene where Charnier and Nicoli lavishly enjoy fine French cuisine in an upscale midtown restaurant while Doyle eats a limp pizza with bland-looking white clam chowder outside in the late December cold. He dumps the tasteless chowder on the sidewalk. ""Popeye"" Doyle is a difficult character to like, even though he works for the law. He certainly has little tolerance for people. His partner Russo may endure him, but one understands that he does not always approve of his methods. Doyle says things like ""dago-town,"" notwithstanding his own partner's surname. On the other hand, one may argue that the cops are doing the best job that they can. Above other scenes, movie patrons justifiably have a problem with the speedy Lincoln reconstruction after it was ruined beyond normal repair. What happened for real was that the car was ripped apart after the hoods were captured. ""The French Connection"" is based upon actual events that occurred about a decade earlier in New York City. Some folks consider this one in the top 250 movies of all time. It certainly swept the Oscars, and was indeed the Best Picture of 1971. Hackman's performance justifiably earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. But the character was generally not understood by audiences.",The French Connection
125,majikstl,Disconnected,5,3 August 2005,"When THE FRENCH CONNECTION is discussed and showing a scene is required, invariably the film clip that is chosen will be taken from the famous car chase sequence. There is a reason for this: There is not much of the rest of the film that's worth watching.Most movies while in production have what is called the second unit. That involves a skeleton crew of craftsmen -- camera, lighting, sound, etc. -- and an assistant director, who go out and film the material of lesser importance; scenes like establishing shots, people going in and out of doors, or crossing the street, or pretending to shop or kill time or whatever. This often also includes any action stunts, such as a car chase. These scenes are not really that important, but are necessary as they act as the glue that holds the rest of the film together by creating mood and bridging gaps in the story. The second unit handles the little details, thus allowing the director and the big name actors to concentrate on the real human drama -- the big picture, so to speak.Watching THE FRENCH CONNECTION, one gets the feeling that 90 percent of it was shot by the second unit. The film is mostly secondary material: scenes of people following people or driving around in traffic or running around the streets. And the famous car chase. It is all secondary details, attached to no big picture. It's like no one actually got around to filming the important stuff, like explaining the plot or defining the characters. There are a few dramatic moments in the film, which allow the characters to shout at each other or explode into fits of poorly motivated anger, but for most of the way, we get routine action that seems designed to connect important scenes that just aren't there. It is like a play that is all stage direction with little or no dialogue; the story gets told, but only in a secondhand way. In the end, it is hard know just why THE FRENCH CONNECTION exists.Gene Hackman, in his Oscar-winning role, gets to sneer and snort and rant and rave, though by the end, his Popeye Doyle seems to be about as poor of a cop as he is a driver. He is rude and crude and something of a bigot, but because he has that all-important gut feeling about the villain, we are supposed to overlook the fact that he isn't doing his job very well at all. Popeye may be the most interesting character in the film, but only by default.The film is, I suppose, an example of the type of ""gritty realism"" that was the vogue of movies in the late 1960s and early 70s. Everything is filmed on location and the dialogue is seemingly improvised in that pseudo-realistic way that seems so totally fake in reality. The filmmakers seem to think they are giving us an inside look at the workings of an undercover cop investigation, with a ""just the facts, ma'am"" coldness that would later be the prevailing style of the ""Law & Order"" and ""CSI"" TV shows. In such procedural dramas, the cops aren't expected to have any personal lives (or personalities, for that matter), so to compensate, the crooks or their crime are vividly portrayed. But in THE FRENCH CONNECTION, the criminals are just as one-note and uninteresting as the cops. And the supposedly true crime, the smuggling of dope from France hidden in a Lincoln Continental, is remarkably banal. Indeed, the car is more interesting than the crooks. It is no wonder the car chase steals the movie: It is contrived and illogical, but at least it shows something of interest happening.And the car chase itself is, well, stupid. Doyle is chasing a killer on an elevated train. He knows where the train is going and where it should stop. He should be calling for back up to intercept the train, not speeding through city streets, reckless endangering innocent lives. But therein lies the film's singular irony: a film that bogs down in its attempt for gritty realism achieves its only true glory by falling back on the most dependable, contrived and utterly artificial of all Hollywood staples, the car chase. So much for gritty reality.",The French Connection

127,Pro Jury,Who is paying their overtime?,1,4 January 2003,"I saw a TV broadcast of this film and what appeared before me was likely highly edited.  The premise is two NYC police officers discover an organized crime ring. Simple enough, but what we see unfold is difficult to believe.Having just worked a full day, the detective's ""breakthrough"" begins that same night in a bar when the perhaps slightly drunk detectives become jealous of a well dressed man with an attractive date.  The two detectives feel the need to follow this man non-stop around-the-clock.The two detectives do not ask permission from any supervisor before they begin mounting massive overtime.  At no time do we see the detectives explain their around-the-clock overtime workload to their chief.  The drive and energy the two detectives bring to this matter comes from either ethnic hatred, unreasonable jealousy, or more likely a need to advance the plot.

He's an asshole, but he got what it takes. Etc.Obviously I can't get behind the moral of the story, but the characters and the story are all great fun. There's memorable, enjoyable scenes that stick with you. The fact that it's based on a true story makes the story go in directions that was probably not too common at the time.There's also the fact - that I didn't learn before after having seen and enjoyed the movie - that the production of the movie was crazy.

Yes New York City is dirty and cold and can be seen by outsiders as a diseased environment with cancer cell like people flowing through its streets. It was just as I remembered visiting it many times as a young boy. That in itself is direction, not fact. It is opinion presented as in an art form but it lacked the pulse of the everyday man that one can easily find in The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. I mention this because the rest of the story appears mundane for a cop and robber story, even one that is more cat and mouse as evidenced in the early subway scene where Hackman is seen getting on or off the subway car based on his counterparts chicanery. I found these scenes too honest structurally and uncompelling, which continues throughout the end. While one can not compare this film to todays uber superhero cops, the comparison to the subway heist movie is quite a contrast. Both out top cop and robber captain exude emotions other than anger or control as well as cunning and likability. I found Fernado Rey short on ""kingpin status"" and Hackman unsympathetic in his performance. Corny to sell the character, as he was in ""Bonnie & Clyde"".

134,jackasstrange,One of the big ones from the 70s,9,22 January 2014,"I often don't like action films, but The French Connection just blew me away. With an excellent performance by Gene Hackman as Jimmy Doyle, the film shows the investigation of the FBI in a great drug traffic case, and the agent Doyle is designed as the chief of the operation. Well, it looks like a simple plot, right? And yes, it is. But is a very well made film, I mean, differently from most action films, that one has a great character development, respectable cinematography (I personally didn't like the manual zoom-in-and-out) with the now 'revolutionary' shaky camera, that automatically adds a great dynamic to the film, and the editing is great. I mean, the scene where the car is chasing the train, at high speed, with the fast but well done montage, was something really groundbreaking. Even the likes of Kubrick and Hitchcock (that frequently used scenes showing the interior ambient of a car in movement in his films didn't reach that level of 'dare' in their films. Again, worthy noting, the cinematography in this film would be perfectly dated and modern if wasn't by the terrible zooms effects, which frankly ruin a bit the overall film. The art direction also was great. There is some really intense action scenes, as I already mentioned the car chase scene, but there is also some suspense(the last sequence, in the supposedly meeting building), funny scenes(the train scene, when the 'French' discovered that Doyle was after him) and even a weird and dark ending, may be considered a twist? I don't know, but it's pretty unexpected. What I want to say is how I was totally clueless until the end that the story was based in true facts. There is so many surreal things, that you just expect to happen in fiction works, that you barely believe that any of these would really happen, most notably the train chase scene. It's one of the greatest films based in true facts that I've ever seen, for sure. Maybe because it has a great source of events, or not, but it's the true. Few films based in true facts really drew my interest in that way, so again, worthy noting to say, it's one of the greatest films ever based in real life events.

136,Thrashman88,Hard to understand at first,7,22 March 2008,"THE FRENCH CONNECTION holds up amazingly well to this day. The solid and real-life acting of Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider is a show on its own. Having seen the movie just yesterday after a 25 year abstinence, I understood the movie more now than I did in my teens. Still, if you don't have any background on the movie or what's it about, you're going to find yourselves guessing just what type of movie you're watching. It's not a ""buddy"" type of movie (like LETHAL WEAPON). It's about two narc agents trying to hit a big heroin transaction, where the buyer is an elegant crook played by Spanish institution Fernando Rey. The story is a bit complex to get at first and moves slowly during the first 50 minutes. After that, the pace picks up moderately.There's a very ""documentary"" feel about the movie; the way it was shot, the acting, the whole atmosphere, which only adds to the realism and rawness of the violence. Because there are so many films now a days that use those gimmicks, I think that's one of the main reasons THE FRENCH CONNECTION holds so well. The famous ""car chase"" sequence, which was hailed as a landmark back in the day, might seem average by today's standards. It's an OK scene, but it's the rest of the movie (the acting, the development of the story) that are the true stand outs.As much as I praise this movie and director William Friedkin, the cultural impact of the movie, may I dare say, has diminished somewhat. This movie won best picture of 1971. In my humble opinion, the award should have gone to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which I think has had a more long lasting influence on a cultural and artistic level, and it's darn good movie too.Complaints aside, THE FRENCH CONNECTION is well worth revisiting!",The French Connection
137,mhasheider,The excitement never stops.,9,27 December 2000,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** William Friedkin's ""The French Connection"" may look like the film that inspired the buddy system for upbeat cops genre.The film was based on the novel by Robin Moore and the actual experiences of two New York city cops - the late Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, who both worked in narcotics. Egan and Grosso both have small parts in this movie.This film is simply exciting and the excitement never stops as one wild narcotics' cop, ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) slowly uncover the plans of a big heroin shipment from France right to the U.S. and stop it.The movie's best scene is where Doyle is nearly shot and killed by one of the smugglers. What follows that is one of the best and wildest car chases that was ever caught on film that ends where Doyle shoots the smuggler on the steps right by the subway. That scene left me only in complete awe.Hackman and Scheider are both dynamic in their performances. Fernando Rey is great as Charnier, the calm French drug smuggler and has a good scene where he waves to Doyle as he leaves on the subway. Doyle is left behind and steaming mad.To me, ""The French Connection"" is like the father of wild detective movies. And it's one of Friedkin's best films.",The French Connection
138,eshwarmail,"If it ends well, all is well",8,8 November 2012,"The trailer to this movie wasn't amusing nor was the first 15 minutes with laughable dialogues and caricature type characters. Everything changes instantly and soon taken over by intense screenplay and performances mixed with an exhilarating tail and chase sequence building up to a clever and perfect climax. This movie can be referred as a lesson on how perseverance can pay.Doyle (Gene Hackman) is a cop in the narcotics bureau who is often criticized for his backfired hunches but well supported by his chief along with his partner Russo (Roy Scheider). Doyle and Russo come across a charismatic couple Boca's in a bar and tails them since they had a bad feeling. Their observation provides leads into some unknown shady deal about to happen. All this seems connected to a Frenchman Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) but the details are still hazy. But Doyle's perseverance and unconventional work ethics helps to put pieces together.Firstly a special commendation should go for the intense and exhilarating chase sequence between a car and a hijacked train. A role of an obsessed cop or a detective is nothing new but when played by someone as talented as Gene Hackman it just gets better. Hackman plays the role with measured intensity, carelessness, obsession and a sense of humor. Roy Scheider gives an apt supporting role while Fernando Rey is very inconsistent ebbing and surging the character's image constantly. Background score isn't too loud which is otherwise very common for thrillers during its era while the photography is very enjoyable with its perfect wide shots and intense maneuvering for additional thrills. The graphic violence lacks technical prowess succumbing to a low quality finished product in a couple of scenes. Though a little disconnected in the beginning, the screenplay pulls up from its lull intensifying and ends up playing the winning role for the movie.If it ends well, all is well",The French Connection
139,werefox08,Popeye.....Does Things....His Way,8,11 March 2013,"Gene Hackman, a narcs cop called ""Popeye Doyle"" won an Academy Award for his brilliant performance...(he appears more scary than the crooks he is after.) It is a 1971 film, and that is one of the many reasons it is great (the 70s was THE golden era for great movies). The Hackman performance rocketed him into stardom. He alone defined the gritty dirty cop fashion which has been copied.....many times, but Popeye reins supreme. Dirty Harry would be strolling around eating a hot dog while shooting those nasty crims. Not so for ""Popeye"". When he was chasing a bad guy...the 100 meter world record was in danger. And chasing a frog in a car..?? He is the epitome of crass insanity. A movie that...still has impact, and without the CGI.",The French Connection
140,jeremy3,Not politically correct!!!!,10,18 May 2007,"I miss the days of non political correctness. In fact, that is the way many cops were back in the day. Hackmann's Popeye Doyle was a racist, but also a smart enough cop to keep his job for as long as he did. Anyone who thinks that this movie glorifies Popeye Doyle, has missed the entire point of the film. Hackmann has never been better. He is a misfit, barely sane cop, addicted to his job. My favorite scene is when Popeye Doyle wakes up with a snap at the bar from the break of dawn. These detectives were like sailors, always on their feet. They could go without sleep for days. This movie was entertaining from start to finish. Everyone shined. Everybody went into their role with a religious zeal. Fernando Rey never had another role like this one. He was the brilliant crook - Charbrier. Never has there been another like Charbrier. He was as charming and tricky as they get. Scheider was not even as good in Jaws. He really fell into his role as the guy stuck with a nutcase as a partner. The ending was brilliant. I have heard that it is about the Vietnam War. Doyle is so intent upon getting Charbrier that he shoots a fellow cop. He ends up shooting bullets in the dark. This ending represents both the moral ambiguity and lack of conclusion that dominated the whole era of the early 70s. I have to say the police chief was brilliantly played. He had to put up with Doyle and yet get everybody to cooperate. Being a police chief is not easy.",The French Connection
141,HenryHextonEsq,Gives modern American thrillers a good name; Popeye Doyle for President! ;-),9,24 February 2002,"I really enjoyed this one, a film which built up and pressed home its effect with increasing velocity throughout. A thriller that certainly does induce a thrill or two; a thriller made along intensely gritty, but impressively artistic lines.The film isn't out to provide ""role models"" or likeable characters; as a recent IMDB reviewer says, some previous comments have completely misunderstood the film's tone. Yes, Doyle is focused on to a great extent, and he is a policeman, but these factors don't necessarily mean he is at all a ""hero"" in any sense, or to identified with as such. It's no black and white struggle, or moral carousal; 'tis a non-judgmental, semi-documentary grey and grey portrayal of something close to untidy, raw reality.The acting is pretty good. Mr Rey is amusingly and inscrutably enigmatic by turns; a formidably questionable man if e'er there was one. I don't remember all the other supporting actors, but they do a thoroughly decent job. Hackman as James ""Popeye"" Doyle, is typically mesmeric; from what I have seen, he is one of the most consistently value-for-money actors in the film world. Here, he creates a vivid, indelible impression of this character as a phenomenally-driven, thoroughly unpleasant individual, with his own idea of what constitutes the law. Hackman never seems to disappoint; whether transcending the film with ""Mississippi Burning"", brilliantly sealing the greatness of ""The Conversation"", or lending this film much of its credibility and power. Ah, for the days when actors of his calibre could regularly attain challenging and starring roles.There seems little doubt that this film is well devised, however; more to it than just Hackman's performance. A reasonable, if unspectacular plot, drawn from reality, is handled with concentrated, disturbing realism. The effects are heightened and the tensions and thrills created, by the magnificent editing and direction. The locations are always imbued with the appropriate tone by the stark, grainy photography; the music perfectly complements the action with its variably pulsing and perforating strains.A fine film, echoing the ingenious chases, photography and suspense of the 1967 French film, ""Le Samourai"", albeit with less attempt to evoke profundity. Undoubtedly, it is a successful film; the artistry of early 1970s experimental Hollywood married to puncturing, ambiguous realism.Rating:- **** 1/2/*****",The French Connection
142,stevenfallonnyc,Incredibly overrated,4,17 September 2005,"Wow, I finally saw The French Connection, and after hearing what an amazing film this was for years, this was a huge letdown. Easily, the greatest thing about this film is Gene Hackman himself, who's so great I can watch him in almost anything (almost). But this is such a poor film, it looks like somebody got Gene Hackman in the movie because Hackman owed a favor or lost a round of poker. Maybe he is Uncle Gene? I'm from Brooklyn so seeing the locals was great, and it has a certain grittiness to it all. I like films that show NYC in the early 70's a lot. But here, almost nothing ever seems to go on. Everey so often Hackman will get angry at somebody, raise his voice and wake the audience up for a little while.Besides Hackman, the car chase of the elevated subway (the ""el"" for you out-of-towners) is incredible, filmed with real elbow grease, and no silly asinine ""CGI"" effects of today. This is a dynamite sequence that's worthy of a fast forward to it, so you can watch it and take the movie out of your DVD player when it's done.But wait, you also have to see Hackman running around in a Santa suit, where he, where guessed it, yells and threatens someone that he catches, in the suit no less. that's worth a few minutes viewing time.But seriously, outside of Hackman and the car chase, this is just hack work, nothing special at all, except to see the early 70's scenes in Brooklyn if you want to take the time for that.",The French Connection
143,quaseprovisorio,it has flaws but it's realism convinces me totally.,9,1 July 2020,"Now what are the main pros for this film? Clearly the filming techniques. The way friedkin films this is amazing. Is almost as if he was born to direct something like this. Is like a documentary yes, the camera moves in a whole bunch a ways, he pulls all the ""tricks"" he has on his book the most point is: this is how the narrative moves forward. it's not about the story but about the twisted poetry of his camera angles. The different shots each sequence can have. big shots, povs, panoramics, travelings it's just an immensely resourceful film. and i don't even talk about the chase scene which is perfect.But it's not only that. is not narrative driven is image driven. the sequences are the narrative. the chases, the wires, the searches, the cars, that's the narrative. and the way the film moves is in the action: we don't have scenes describing the characters we know popeye doyle with the narrative progressing. we understand his partner has a calmer temper than he has, we know the villains mostly the french guy has another ""educational"" level. And this seems a portrait of a specific vision of new york: a dirty city, with rude cops, drug crime and corrupt people. a city where a cop goes to a bar full of black people and don't care if they're innocents or not. the characters are just a consequence of it. The characters are not swallowed nor driven by the narrative. they are the consequence of this new york. that's why the french guy looks so different. he's an outsider and it shows.i feel this is somehow a mix between hbo's the wire and jules dassin ""the naked city"" - a 1950's movie with a huge documental vibe where the police characters were pretty much asking questions and going to places throughout the whole film - they had a narrator. but it was also a neorealist portrait of new york. this has the police tasks that seem to be related with the wire - no die hard like i read somewhere - with a mix of ""let's see a bunch of new york citizens doing their work"" whch was for me the basis of ""the naked city"".now, did this movie ressonated with me personally? not much to be honest i'm not a new yorker, i have literally an ocean of distance from that city. the characters aren't exactly guys i would relate with, and they're not the deepest dudes, even though doyle is a very distinctive guy- because in a way they are their job in that city. but it's a great film. again, technically flawless, with a very good pace that is able to amaze us visually a lot of times.with my heart i would give a lower grade. but i think it doesn't deserve it. rationally it deserves more (like the handmaiden movie i reviewed before). i don't know if i'm going to revisit this a bunch of times but...this is just those really well made films that even if i'm not in love with i can't give it lower. why? because it's almost flawless in my book. i would like more empathic characters? maybe? but they wouldn't serve the purpose of this. plus, how the movie is made amazed me. this is true action. this is what i call cinema: images moving, telling a story - amost in a nouvelle vague way i can't explain totally.",The French Connection
144,Sonatine97,"Enigmatic, Relentless, Depressing, Brilliant......",8,13 August 2000,"French Connection holds no prisoners: it's a tough, documentary-style crime thriller that never knows when to give up.Based on a true incident, detectives ""Popeye"" Doyle (Hackman) and his buddy Kliene (Scheider) work the 70s crime streets of New York. On the basis of a tip off and some curious goings-on from various known crims, they use undercover surveillance on a French gang who threaten to do a huge drugs import deal worth millions of dollars.Initially faced with scepticism within their own department as well as two colleagues from the FBI Popeye is convinced the deal is going to happen real soon. But without hard evidence and some previously failed raids they're both taken off the case.From this point the movie trips into top gear as Popeye is almost killed by a sniper to whom he later gives chase, first by foot and then by the remarkable car/train chase.Director, Friedkin really hits the right notes with this tough, uncompromising film. There are no beautiful actors here, no flashy cars or suits or easily resolved riddles like you tend to find in a lot of contemporary films (the rather poor ""Heat"" being one prime example). This film is as you would find in real life on the streets of any big city, where footwork and a lot of disappointments are the order of the day.The film is most remembered for that Car Chase which is both a bonus & a millstone, because people tend to forget the real details of the story for the sake of the all-action chase. Hackman has never been better, and even eclipses his wonderful part in The Conversation (1973). He truly revels in his role as the determined Popeye eager to track down his nemesis ""Frog One"" wonderfully underplayed by Fernando Rey. Scheider gives excellent support as Hackman's colleague, who trusts Hackman's instincts even though he isn't quite so enthusiastic about going beyond all legal means of police detection work to which Hackman is ever forced to consider.The music suits the content of the film to a tee. Either very pounding, or slow, industrial & methodical just like the characters on screen. While the cinematography is also very streetwise & unrestrained (this was pre-SteadyCam).The car chase is still talked about nearly 30 years on. The most remarkable aspect is that it was more or less a one-take shot, and a lot of it is very much unrehearsed (as the IMDM Trivia Notes will testify too).Whether it still holds a candle to modern day chases is a moot point, but it doesn't really matter because when people look back on their favourite chase they will either remember this one or probably Steve McQueen in ""Bullitt"" (1968).French Connection is perhaps one of the best cop films of the 70s (or any era for that matter). There are no real heroes, no soundbites (aka. Harry Callaghan's ""Make My Day"" or ""Feel Lucky, Punk!""). Just wonderfully convincing acting with no contrived endings.The only real complaint is the lack of characterization from the two leads. We get to know little or nothing about their family/private life other than Popeye chases girls and lives on his own (as far as we know). Without this extra dimension it's difficult for us to really warm to either of them, even though they're fighting good against evil.But nontheless, French Connection is a superior film and deserved the awards it so easily won. It also outshines the latter sequel by quite a distance too.Don't be shocked by the rather outdated 70s look: crime is crime whatever the era. French Connection Rocks!!*****/*****",The French Connection
145,HelloTexas11,excellent tough cop flick,9,27 June 2008,"One of the things that strikes you while watching 'The French Connection' is how absolutely cruddy Brooklyn, New York looks. If this movie is to be believed, it is an urban nightmare (or at least was, circa 1971). Trash-strewn lawns jammed next to crowded overhead freeways, filthy sidewalks, bleak alleys and side-streets patrolled by young punks waiting to break into your car. At one point, a cop walks past a downtown doorway where lies a man in an overcoat, face down. The cop doesn't even blink or slow down; he just keeps on walking. It has nothing to do with the plot of the movie, it's strictly background, or ambiance. And downtown itself seems to be mainly a collection of small restaurants, boutiques, and newsstands crowded together at street level. What goes on in the second, third, and fourth stories of these buildings? Something tells me we don't want to know. And what a plethora of eateries, which I found strange because should I ever find myself in this Brooklyn, getting something to eat would be dead last on my list of things to do. The people are busy, driven it seems; there's not a soft or sentimental character in the movie. Typifying them is 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman), a narcotics cop who is driven to bust drug users and dealers. He's not on any moralistic crusade; one could make the argument that he's no better a human being than the people he arrests. But it's his all-consuming passion, for some reason, and he seems to have no other life to really speak of. He and his partner, Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider), get a tip about a big heroin shipment on its way to New York and the various plot elements start to fall into place. Much has been said about the chase scene later in the film, and it is a knockout, sort of the granddaddy of all great chase scenes. In a sense, though, the whole MOVIE is one long chase, as Doyle and Russo spend almost all of their waking hours tailing one suspect or another. There is one sequence in particular, just prior to the great chase, where Doyle shadows the prime heroin smuggler Alain Charnier (a wonderfully cool and smug performance by Fernando Rey). It is every bit as well-staged as the car chase that follows, except here it is simply one man trying to follow another through the labyrinth of downtown Brooklyn without losing him. Charnier offers no hint that he suspects he is being followed; he never looks directly at Doyle, even when glancing around. The audience is as frustrated as Doyle when Charnier walks through shops and across streets almost interminably before getting on a subway train, only to get off before it leaves, then get on again, at which point Doyle loses him. It is only when Charnier looks at Doyle directly for the first time through the train window and offers a small wave goodbye that we realize he knew all along. Great stuff. The success of 'The French Connection' both at the box-office and the Academy Awards says something about the era in which it was produced. The early seventies were the time for gritty, violent cop thrillers. The first 'Dirty Harry' film came out the same year. 'French Connection' spawned not only a sequel of its own, but a follow-up of sorts starring Roy Scheider, 'The Seven-Ups.' Even good old John Wayne briefly got into the act with 'McQ.' Audiences were really enjoying the realism and profane dialogue recently unleashed and rated 'R.' Looking back on it now, 'The French Connection' plays like a tough little indie film, and has an almost documentary feel to it in places. It is part and parcel of its era, a grimy time capsule of the early 70's.",The French Connection

I suppose those who gave this classic film a mediocre rating have been raised to believe that special effects equals story and that a star equals a character.Here is an important story made gripping and suspenseful by perfect casting, perfect direction and impeccable production values.  Before the Motion Picture Academy went completely meretricious and kissed the a**es of the likes of Mike Ovitz and James Cameron, they recognized truly great cinema. In 1971 they did this by giving French Connection a sweep of the Oscars.There are so many wonderful things in this film, I can only name a few:  1.

148,son_of_cheese_messiah,One long cat and mouse game,9,11 April 2011,"One could criticise this film for being too unvaried: it consists of virtually nothing but surveillance and pursuit. We know nothing of the home lives of the heroes, for instance, except a brief excursion into the kinky side of Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman). We actually see much more of the backgrounds of the villains and they seem more normal and even more sophisticated.Is this then a criticism of the police? I don't think so, at least not up until the finale. We see the dedicated law men having to deal with the scum of society, sacrificing the normality of their own lives. In one important scene, Doyle waits outside in the bitter cold with a cup of coffee so disgusting he tips it away, while observing the criminal, Frog One (Fernando Rey), eating in comfort in a lavish restaurant.In my view the unvaried nature of the film, one long cat and mouse game, adds to its intensity and any interpolated scenes of family normality would dilute it. I do however have a few problems with this film.Perhaps because of the original nature of most of it, the few clichés stick out. The tired ""You're off the case"" just before an attempt is made to kill Doyle. Even worse is the car being stripped and the ""I've ripped out everything but the rocker panels"". This is so stupid it annoyed me even when I watched it as a kid. Obviously the ludicrous way in which the car is miraculously re-assembled without a scratch is also a mark against the film.What is so irksome about all these is that they were so unnecessary. It is like someone painting a moustache on the face of the Mona Lisa and not noticing. It could, and should, have been avoided. Another is when Frog One is allowed to drive over the bridge before the police appear thus giving the criminals an opportunity to escape, an opportunity which Frog One takes. However this could be interpreted as Doyle's own ego in wanting to actually see the look on Frog One's face when he was caught.I must say, too, that I find the ending too downbeat and nihilistic. The complete callousness with which Doyle having shot his fellow cop dead, simply ignores him, is deeply troubling. I'm not sure I completely believe it, at least as presented here.",The French Connection

150,MF210,A Good but not Great Film,8,9 November 2003,"My Rating: *** out of ****. The French Connection won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay over Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. This was a travesty because A Clockwork Orange is superior in everyway. Its just one of those things the Academy pulls on occassion. Dont get me wrong, The French Connection is a good film but its just not a great one.
The most interesting thing about The French Connection is the way it is filmed. It has a documentary-style look to it. This gives the film a realistic style to it. The Cinematography, which plays a big part in this, is excellent. I am not as familar with director William Friedkin's work, except for The Exorcist. His direction here is nothing compared to Stanley Kubrick's masterful job in A Clockwork Orange but he does a solid job. Friedkin keeps the camera moving alot (most noticeably near the end) which makes the movie interesting. The Script also won an oscar and I find that somewhat puzzling. Its not that its a bad script, its just that there is not much dialogue there. I think A Clockwork Orange should have definitely won here. It features more memorable dialogue. The acting is hard to comment upon, since none of the actors say a whole lot. Gene Hackman does a great job when delivering his dialogue and his facial expressions say alot too. I am not sure he deserved the Oscar but its not a huge travesty. However, Roy Schieder did not deserve a nomination, he did a solid job but he was not as crucial as Hackman was.
Probably the most praised thing in this film is the car chase. It is one hell of a chase. Its worth seeing for it alone. When this film grips you, it grips you hard. The car chase is absolutely exhilirating.

151,arthurclay,A classic police drama,8,4 May 2005,"I watched it a little more than a year ago and it was good. Hackman won an Academy Award as Popeye Doyle, a New York police detective who investigated a drug smuggling ring operated by a mastermind French criminal known as The French Connection. A true story of a drug smuggler who set up a transaction with New York Mafia gangsters and their rich Jewish bankers to import cocaine into the U.S. Doyle and his parter Russo (Roy Schneider) learn from informants that something big is cooking and they investigate an Italian restaurant store owner who is syndicate friendly and which leads them up the food chain to Henri Devereaux, a French businessman whose business is less than legitimate. He makes the list of the top ten most evil bad guys on screen and his sophistication is disarming while his power is unquestioned. Devereaux discovers the two detectives are on to him and orders his French hit-man to eliminate them. This leads to a car chase through New York that is the most famous in cinema and a grand finale that blows your mind. You're left with more questions than you started out with but at this point you don't really care that much as you are totally amazed at what has just transpired. It is a little slow in parts but it does pick up speed about halfway thru so be patient and watch the whole thing. It's most certainly worth it.",The French Connection

153,sandnair87,Not Your Run-Of-The-Mill Cop Thriller!,9,26 March 2015,"Based on the real-life exploits of two New York detectives, 'The French Connection' is a knockout cop thriller with so much jarring excitement that it will have you literally gasping for breath. The movie is one of the undisputed must-sees of guy-dom: raw, gritty, grimy, elegant in its plot simplicity yet incredibly complex in its action movie workmanship.Gene Hackman plays Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, a tough cop with a shaky reputation who busts a lot of street junkies but needs a big-ticket case to keep his career together. He lurches on a rather suspicious- looking character in a night club and tails him all night long with dogged persistence only to stumble upon a drug deal that involves a $32 million shipment of high-grade heroin smuggled from Marseilles to New York. The trail soon leads them to the 'Frenchman' (played impeccably by the suave Fernando Rey), the suspected 'connection' in a highly organized dope ring. Going on pure instinct, he and his low-key partner Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo (Roy Scheider) stick to their prime suspect like glue and pursue the case with a single-minded ferocity that is frankly amoral. From there on, the tension spirals to agonizing altitudes leading up to it's stunningly nihilist ending.As far as the story goes, the film has the depth of a mud puddle, but director William Friedkin sets such a frantic pace that there is hardly a chance to notice, much less care. What Friedkin does with the ease of an auteur is to re-vitalize the original story - there is such a gusty authenticity about the film that, for once, we feel as if we are seeing flesh-and-blood cops in action instead of cardboard cut-outs. He shatters any illusions we might have about New York's finest (the city has never looked this ugly) and creates a wonderfully edgy atmosphere. It is a testament to Hackman's talents that he not only manages to embody a wholly despicable character, but makes him endlessly watchable. He effortlessly keeps his Doyle as a Grade-A ass-wipe but still gets us to root for him, thereby elevating the stakes in the story from a simple police cat- and-mouse chase into something much more electrifying. Scheider is entirely believable as Popeye's hard-nosed sidekick and plays his part with tenacious naturalism.A newfangled genre flick fraught with urban decay, William Friedkin's run-and-gun procedural creates a paradigm for the tell- it-like-it- is cop drama. Sure, it is best remembered for its groundbreaking 10- minute chase sequence (an imposing study in creating thrills entirely in the editing room), but mind you, it's not just a chase film! It's a detective yarn of the highest order, capped off with a blistering central performance that turns this into a hard-as-nail crime saga!",The French Connection

While I don't rate it too highly, in the scheme of things it is a great 70's film about the hard times of New York Cops as they battle against drugs. The French Connection details international heroin smuggling into New York City via the ""French Connection"" and the attempts of a different kind of detective who wished to stop it. This and Bullit are both widely known for an exciting car chase (what about the film ""The Chase""). Good acting, writing, and location filming made this one of the big hits of 1971.  A sequel follows.  As time passes, the story is still good, but modern technology would up-date this drama.  Of course a battle against drugs is a win-lose situation.

There is no significant element of intrigue, and instead a lot of scenes where the leads follow the criminals for block after block were put in.

This film made Hackman a star and deservedly so as he must be one of the most consistent actors out there, what I mean is even if the film isn't great, if Gene Hackman is in it, he will still give a great performance. The French Connection is a great film. Brilliantly directed by William Friedkin, also a pre-Jaws Roy Scheidner appears and is fantastic as Hackmans partner. Another gem from the early 70's a great time for movies. I highly recommend you add this to your DVD collection, I got it bundled with French Connection 2 which I've yet to see. ***9/10***",The French Connection
157,dataconflossmoor,It Was A Pontiac!!,10,29 January 2008,"This film is always referred to as one of the greatest American movies ever made!! That should come as no surprise to anyone!! The movie ""French Connection"" was very short, and concise, and, it conveyed a stunningly poignant message concerning a breakthrough in the safe guard against drug trafficking!! This movie was based on a true story about a New York detective, Eddie Egan, who made a cameo appearance in this film. The film ""French Connection"" captivated the interests of some dynamic Hollywood novices, yet, it did not embrace the enthusiasm of the mainstream producers or directors!! The gamble to produce this film, which was based on the book written by Robin Moore, definitely paid off!! The habitual lamentations of the New York City law enforcement branches via Eddie Egan, contended that drugs were smuggled into New York City without any threat of legal repercussions. While most officials spend countless hours inveighing against New York's criminal activity, invariably, they become thwarted, and their competitive nature gets the better of them. If the syndicate is not overtly flaunting their unencumbered acts of illicit behavior to figureheads of the law, their Armani Suits, Chalets on the Riviera, and Park Avenue Penthouses, are doing that job for them!! Originally, Jackie Gleason was suppose to play the role of Detective ""Popeye"" Doyle. Just like Gene Hackman, Gleason evokes a bittersweet disposition of the hard luck and desultory curmudgeon!! ""Requiem Foor A Heavyweight"" is a picture-book example of such a role!! Gleason turned down the part in ""French Connection"" and from there, the producers sought other seemingly appropriate actors for the role. Gene Hackman was the 11th choice for the part, this strikes me as utterly amazing!! By now, it would appear to most people that it would be impossible to fathom anyone else but Gene Hackman for the lead role of ""Popeye"" Doyle in ""French Connection""!! The whole motif of monumental despondence with capital crimes in New York City had to be assertively articulated in this film. The prevailing circumstances to this 1960's heroine smuggling was one which engaged in the polarization of ethnicity!! The detectives and policemen were portrayed as either Irish or Italian, these two ethnic groups comprised the vast majority of the New York City police force during the 1960's. The contention which was pertinent to these two cultural stereotypes was that the Italians had the finesse to effectively commiserate with criminals, and the Irish were so incredibly tough, that they could handle them!! The most ethically deplorable drug syndicate that New York had to deal with was the French syndicate!! Directly smuggling these drugs in from Marseilles, the French culture had accommodated a scruple-less venue for worldwide disruption by illustrating an unmitigated temerity for New Yorkers, as well as Americans in general!! Since the French Underworld have cultivated an imperviousness to a higher spirituality, their philosophy is overly consumed by the ruthless attainment of material accoutrement!! It is this callous and dehumanizing resolve of the pompous and arrogant French syndicate which has effectuated a very emphatic, hierarchal, and almost reinvented ruling plight of pejorative antidisestablishmentarianism to the nth degree!! The intensity of the French syndicate's presumingly vindictive and amoral procedures are what the officials of New York have to take into account when dealing with such a formidable adversary!! Being fatalistic about human nature, the French Syndicate has no boundaries of conscientious remorse which would inhibit them in any way. Apparently, even by comparison to the Italian and the Russian Mafia, they (The French Syndicate) exalted an extraordinary level of nauseating belligerence!! So, what was the final commentary of justice in this movie? It was very demoralizing for one.. Why was a precedent set here? Because, when it was all over, now emanated the proverbial tenet that even if a bully wins, a bully does not even like to be battered around in any way whatsoever!! Win or lose, it is ideologically pivotal when an official takes on organized crime, and he realistically makes a difference!! After viewing this movie, many people may want to ponder this very pragmatic question, Why would anyone want to live in New York City? This cosmopolitan nightmare is a bevy of hard bitten realism, at the same time, people who live in New York actually live.. As that one story has it (I am paraphrasing), he never drank, he never laughed, he never kissed a maiden, he never cajoled, he never chuckled, or engaged in anything pleasure laden, and when he up and passed away insurance was denied, because since they claim he never lived, they claim he never died!! Such an analogy pertains to the gist of this movie, and it affects the thought patterns of Popeye Doyle, BELIEVE ME!! The film ""French Connection"" was a fabulous movie, the acting, the directing, and the storyline were all first rate!! The film ""French Connection"" won best picture in 1971, as well as best director, William Friedkin, and of course, best actor, Gene Hackman!! The classic car chase scene in ""French Connection"" is considered by most movie experts to be one the best scenes in any movie made ... period!! This scene has inspired many virtual reality games in the ensuing years ahead!! Fabulous Film!! By the way, the car Gene Hackman drove in this classic scene, it was a Pontiac!!!",The French Connection

159,dfloro,Popeye Doyle obsesses over the chase,8,14 November 2021,"After spending most of his career in the 1960s appearing in various series and movies made for TV, Gene Hackman starts to really hone his acting craft with the Popeye Doyle character in 1971's ""The French Connection."" Based on an allegedly true story involving Hackman and Roy Scheider's cop characters, this tale is basically a lengthy chase scene by the obsessive-compulsive cop, Hackman, interrupted only by occasional violent confrontations/shootouts. And its penultimate resolution comes at the end of one of the greatest car chases in cinema history, with Popeye racing after a runaway elevated train under the raised tracks. Director William Friedkin has admitted to not having the proper licensing, permits or traffic control for filming the truly thrilling (and hence, doubly dangerous) sequence, making the history-making filmed result all the more amazing to consider. For its acting, pacing, film editing and direction, all of which have left their indelible mark on the 50 years of movie-making since, it deserves an 8/10 star review.",The French Connection
160,lucasversantvoort,Gritty filmmaking at its finest,8,6 May 2015,"Throughout film history, there've been a lot of action flicks that feel tame by today's standards. By that I mean you really have to put in the effort to care and appreciate it. This often ends with having to 'consider the time it was made'. Not with The French Connection, however. This film still rivets from beginning to end.The action takes place in New York. Detectives Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) are partners and always work together on stakeouts and busts. After a successful bust, they head out to a local bar to relax. There however, Popeye's sixth sense tells him several of the bar's visitors are 'dirty', mob guys dealing in narcotics. Relentless, Popeye decides they should tail them, much to Russo's dismay. This eventually leads them to discover a plot to smuggle 32 million dollars' worth of heroin into the USA by hiding it in the car of a French television personality.That in itself may not sound like much, but the appeal lies in the execution. The film strips away all the gloss, gets rid of heroic notions of police life and presents it in the most wonderfully dreary way possible. It's one of those films that is often described as being 'realistic' and 'gritty'. And while a (justifiably famous) car chase including an elevated train probably doesn't earn that description, the overall film emanates this aura.Now, I'm not one to ramble on about how 'the city feels like a character', but Connection makes the most out of New York. The cinematography emphasizes the sleazy, steamy alleyways, the busy traffic, etc. It adds to the whole atmosphere where each store could hide a large heroin smuggling scam and the only option is to hide in the opposite building 24/7 and monitor the store's activity.Speaking of which, that's the other major appeal: Popeye's determination to chase criminals. He has no social life besides the occasional one-night stand and he's made it his mission in life to take down criminals one by one, sometimes to the frustration of his colleagues. This relentless behavior is portrayed masterfully by Hackman in one his most famous roles. Little moments excite like when his predatory eyes scan the bar for criminals in the scene described above or his mounting frustration when he's lost the person he's chasing. You get swept up in his desire to catch the criminals.Another indication of success is the amount of Oscars Connection won, including Best Picture, a prize usually reserved for more heavyweight dramas. As far as action films go, this is required viewing. Save for a handful of moments that feel dated, it's got it all: the atmosphere, the acting, classic action scenes, everything you could want in an action film.",The French Connection
161,mbrcf,Stood the tests of time,9,9 January 2021,"When I'm thinking of a quality named ""intense"" and a film to describe with that quality, then The French Connection is one of the very first ones to pop-up to my mind. After watching many more films of thriller-suspense genre and coming back to this, I'm quiet shocked by how tense, nerve-racking and nail-biting this was.The whole feature consists of a series of spying, eavesdropping and full blown-up chases between two New York narcotic agents, a very frustrated hot-headed Gene Hackman (you love to see it) and his pal Roy Scheider and a drug-trafficking European-based band led by the ingenious, elusive Fernando Rey. Some of-or most of- the scenes in this film are far ahead of it release time and easily live up to today's standards. It all gets much more impressive when you find out that the whole story is based on a non-fiction account by author Robin Moore.It's a film that has stood against the tides of time and history and it's even more relatable due to recent reports of the police incidents and scandals.",The French Connection
162,Lupercali,And that's it...?,6,9 September 2004,"I do remember 'The French Connection' coming out. I was too young to see it, but just establishing that I do remember the old days...It's pretty difficult, viewing 'The French Connection' in 2004, to get excited about it. Maybe it was gritty, realistic, innovative or whatever in 1971, but today it just plays like an episode of an overlong TV cop show. The plot is uninteresting. Scheider is boring. Hackman is a convincing tough guy maverick cop, but we've seen it all 100 times since then. And as for the greatest car chase ever filmed - that thing where he drives along underneath the train, dodges some cars and knocks over some garbage? Please! 'The Burglars' with Omar Shariff came out the same year, and the car chase in that made Hackman's effort look like my mother driving to the supermarket.Admittedly my mother did once roll the car driving to the supermarket, but that was in about 1970, and shouldn't be taken as a typical example of her driving style.Ah, what to say: really, it seems like a pretty ordinary movie now. Hard to believe it won best picture, actor and director, or, for that matter, that it's nudging against the top 250 here.6.5",The French Connection
163,Dog-River,Am I Missing Something?,1,2 May 2021,"How did this win best picture at the Oscars? I mean, I don't get it. The story overall was not very interesting and by no means is this film a masterpiece. While Gene Hackman did a decent acting job, his character was a very unlikeable person and he was also terrible at his job. Him undercover at the subway station was more laughable, than serious. No wonder the bad guy noticed him. Another thing that stuck out to me, Gene's character accidently kills a federal agent and he shows no remorse, not even for a split second and then he didn't even get the guy he was looking for. It's not a movie I'd recommend to someone.",The French Connection
164,stp43,Still The Last Word In Police Dramas,10,7 December 2002,"The French Connection remains perhaps the very best police drama ever made, combining a strong storyline with audacious direction from William Friedkin, superior performances from the large cast, and the most audacious car-chase ever filmed.The contrast between the main pursuer (Gene Hackman's Popeye Doyle) and the pursued (Fernando Rey's Alain Chanier) is the film's primary theme.  Chanier is cultured, wealthy, debonair, with a beautiful and loving wife, a daughter, and seemingly everything going for him.  Popeye Doyle is uncouth, driven, profane, often violent, and has no anchorage in his life.  That the ""thuggish"" Popeye is a policeman while the gentlemanly Chanier is a drug dealer makes the contrasts all the more striking.  Of course the film is so much more - the cat-and-mouse game and internal squabbles among the two sides (Popeye's feud with FBI Agent Bill Mulderig; Sal Boca's mistakes as a novice big-time dope dealer that result in several complications with Chanier and other hoods), and the attempted hit sanctioned by Chanier on Popeye that results in filmdom's most famous automobile pursuit (a car chasing a train remains audacious) all lead to the climatic showdown outside the city, and cements the film as among the 100 greatest of all.",The French Connection

(The duh! Moment of the movie). Better yet is when the desk cop tells Devereaux and his flunkie, ""This is a non-smoking area; you'll have to extinguish your cigarettes."" That was a very novel concept in 1971, and took more than 20 years to catch on in the rest of the USA.But the fact that the troops have been told to delay the release of the ""dirty"" car makes it both funny and quizical; did the desk cop tell Devereaux and his flunky that they had to extinguish their cigarettes as a delaying tactic, or out of a perfunctory sense of duty?And this comes after the possibly greatest chase scene in cinematic history, with Popeye chasing an elevated train in a commandeered car.I think this is Friedkin's best film, and one of the best Hollywood films of all time.",The French Connection
167,nixskits,What part of the car didn't they check?,10,23 November 2009,"This film still holds up for many reasons, mainly the best and most necessary car chase in history, with no digital effects at all. And the acting equivalent, a full speed ahead vehicle named Popeye Doyle. Gene Hackman gives one of his three best performances here (""The Conversation"" and I'll let y'all choose a third of your preference to round out the hot stack of Hackman's classic knacks).Before ""Cocaine Cowboys"" showed us a Miami out of control on coke and cops lining up to be handed bribe money, ""The French Connection"" gave us a fascinating character who was based on Eddie Egan, an old schooler who would get a gut instinct that someone he just saw for the first time was ""dirty"" and follow them on his hunch, often right that the suspect was up to no good. His more level headed partner, Cloudy, based on Sonny Grosso, hates criminals as much as Popeye but restrains himself from going over the top. Scheider is perfect as Cloudy.Enter Fernando Rey, an actor who made over 200 films and probably didn't have a better role before or since. He's much more debonair than the person his Charnier is based on but that's to our advantage here, as this continental man is part of a group bringing major weight heroin into the United States and getting away with it because payoffs are certainly made up to the highest levels to keep the drug machine profitable.

Still Can't Top It Today!,9,26 February 2021,"The French Connection is a great story (based on true events) with great characters (based on real people) that combines the best elements of action, intrigue, deception, obsession and ruthlessness.A fascinating character study of the hero, ""Popeye"" Doyle and the villain, Chenerie, scene after scene shows the cat-and-mouse chess game unfold in surprising and powerful ways. The subway scene where Popeye is covertly tailing the villain (who knows he is being tailed) is great. And of course, the car chasing the elevated train is amazing and could not be done today.Fundamentally this is a ""Great White Whale"" story that doesn't end well for the pursuer. Our hero is obsessed to the point of blocking out all considerations (including the safety of himself and his fellow officers) other than capturing his prey. This ultimately proves to be his down-fall, if only temporarily (see French Connection II).The documentary on making the film is almost as engaging and fascinating as the film itself, from the extreme liberties they took when shooting on location to the apparent ""accidental"" casting of the villain. Also, some of the seemingly odd dialog makes sense only after watching the special features interviews.Well worth the viewing and stands up today as a tough, well-paced (patient) crime drama that doesn't pull any punches.

You can't get more exciting than a ten minute car chase that winds through the NYC transit system as Popeye smashes off buses, cars, walls, and whatever else he can sideswipe to keep moving. The particular car chase scene I'm speaking about had the same motivation to keep going that a concussion victim has to stay awake: to keep going as if your life depended on it. As Popeye wedged his way past intersections of crossing cars and off of walls that pointed his car kind of in the direction he wanted to go, we quickly become enthralled by the amount of drive he has. Past dump trucks, around lines of more cars, almost over a baby carriage, you slowly get sucked into his desperation and suddenly his passion for the chase translates into your passion to watch him chase. It's ingenious how Friedkin used the in-car perspective of the chase and the jarring close-up shots of the car hitting the next object to glue you to the screen through visceral action. I've even begun to speak in first person plural, trying to include the rest of you in on my experiences watching this car chase. That is exactly how Friedkin entraps us and makes us watch.

I love cop films- particularly ones that have some of the ""greatest chase scenes ever made"" and narcotics cops. I love Dirty Harry, the old westerns, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Apocalypse Now and Do the Right thing. And this comment goes without any arrogance- I think I pretty much like the really ""good"" films in general- or at least can appreciate their good acting or script, even if it isn't my cup of tea. For example, ""The African Queen"".But this was a sloppy, dull, SLOW, incoherent poorly done mess. Yes, a mess. I quite pity Roger Ebert giving this 4 out of 4. My lord, am I the only one who noticed that a chase scene begins at night and finishes in broad daylight? Did they run all night? They must have superb stamina. It could barely hold my attention, but not because not loads was going on- I can appreciate films with a slow build up where the director seems to actually know what was going on. But here? I think not. How on earth- and I really mean this- did this win Oscars for best screenplay, picture, editing and direction? OK, Gene Hackman did well with his awful script. But please, Dirty Harry was a far more interesting, well written, directed, character driven movie- an action film, sure, but one that shows how a normal cop can turn into an obsessive wreck over one criminal.

176,Danimal-7,Dull and repulsive,4,2 September 1999,"It's hard for me to decide whether THE FRENCH CONNECTION or CHINATOWN is the most overrated film of the 1970s, but certainly THE FRENCH CONNECTION is more disappointing.  Gene Hackman gives us the thoroughly repulsive antihero of Popeye Doyle (apologies to the real man, I have no reason to assume he is as stomach-turning as the cinematic character).  He's a bigot, and not only does he not care about hurting civilians in catching criminals, he doesn't care about hurting other cops either.  Those who would remind him of the consequences of his actions meet his indifference or his fists.This is no criticism of Hackman, one of the greatest actors in the world. He plays the character exactly the way William Friedkin wants him to; he's never artificial or unconvincing, just boring and totally unsympathetic. Why Friedkin thinks we are supposed to care what happens to this character is beyond me.  Fernando Rey's sinister charm in the role of Alain Charnier, Doyle's drug dealing nemesis, is entirely more appealing.  Sure he's a criminal, but he doesn't have the hypocrisy to pretend that he's a good guy.The most talked-about scene in the movie is the car chase.  Doubtless this scene was extremely effective in 1971, but later generations accustomed to modern special effects will not be overly impressed.  And no chase scene, no matter how well-executed, is a substitute for a compelling plot and interesting characters.  Ask George Lucas.This movie made me want a murdering drug dealer to win and a policeman to lose.  I don't know what I would have done without that experience.

We've all heard of it. But how many of us have actually seen it?It holds up strong!Starring Gene Hackman as Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle, a brash alcoholic but passionate police officer. Roy Scheider received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor as Buddy Russo, his more reserved partner. Their characters are based on real-life detectives Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso.The French Connection was nominated for eight academy awards in 1972 and won five, including: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay and Film Editing.The movie dives right in, with Popeye in a Santa suit, and the rare 'chase on foot' through the streets of Marseille. The French part of The French Connection ends rather quickly because the setting soon transitions to Brooklyn for the remainder of the picture.Let's talk chase scenes.The FC's got three: Two on-foot, and one via automotive that podiums amongst the top car chases in cinematic history.Did Hackman's character introduce the cop cliché of commandeering a vehicle?As for the other hunt on foot, it's a passive chase in which both parties are co-aware.No matter the manner of pursuit, Friedkin fires on all cylinders.(Quick sidebar: Top seven car chases, in no particular order. The French Connection, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Drive, The Blues Brothers, The Matrix Reloaded, Jack Reacher and Children of Men.)While attending the Turner Classic Movie Festival, I saw William Friedkin speak, and can happily report he's a cordial, sharp-witted and poignant interviewee. He seems like a really good dude.Amongst a number of others, his top films include The Exorcist from 1973 and Arbitrage from 2012.Anyway, The French Connection is a riveting thrill ride that utilizes a number of stylistic shooting techniques.The car-dismantling scene will have you on the edge of your seat. There are relatively few weaknesses. Specifically a sprinkling of clunky ADR (Additional Dialogue Recording) and a train conductor loses consciousness in an unrealistic fashion. Other than that, the loose threads are minimal.Some plot points require post-viewing research. The ending's a bit puzzling. And Popeye's character utilizes a psychological interrogation tactic that will have you scratching your head.While he berates Willy with questions, he interrogates the man about, ""the last time he picked his feet in Poughkeepsie,"" in order to cause confusion. According to Friedkin, its inclusion is due to the real-life interrogation technique developed by Eddie Egan.Some of the stylistic camera techniques are rather innovative. Like the excellent use of 'silent dialogue.'At one point, Popeye's staking out a restaurant. The cameraman is seated at the table with the two men he's tailing. While Popeye clearly freezes outside, dumping out his presumably cold coffee, the camera slowly zooms in on him.It's an enchanting effect; creating ponderous distance between the audible and visual aspects of the film.Popeye's relationship with his stool pigeon is unexpected, compelling and fun. It's an intriguing plot device in which to illustrate our protagonist's scruples.All in all, The French Connection is a fantastic flick.It's on the shorter end of the spectrum.It's poignant, innovative and gripping,It's Gene Hackman at his best.You'll devour it!",The French Connection

The movie has some tremendous action scenes, doesn't spend too much time getting into the characters and isn't dialogue-heavy. Gene Hackman gives a great performance by getting right into the Popeye Doyle character with ease. He most definitely deserved the Academy Award. Roy Schieder gives a weighty supporting performance as Russo, Doyle's partner, and Fernando Rey plays the suave antagonist in this film almost too well.The thing that I like most about the French Connection is the car chase scene. This car chase is the best in film and may not ever be surpassed. The film works well because it isn't over extenuated, rather it gets to the point from the beginning and doesn't stray from the main plot line. The fact that this film was based on a true story adds the important sense of realism to this film that isn't present in many other shoot-em-up fests.This gritty, real-life cop story will always remain as one of my favourite action films, if not one of my favourite films overall.8/10 stars.",The French Connection
180,PeachesIR,Almost a perfect film,10,24 September 2021,"""The French Connection"" is near perfect, a thrillingly tense cat-and-mouse game between gritty NYPD narcotics detectives and a ring of heroin smugglers led by a suave, cultured French crime boss in it for one final, lucrative deal. Gene Hackman's Oscar-winning performance as Det. Popeye Doyle is at the heart of this gritty, grimy story: he is thoroughly unlikable, volatile, violent, brimming with resentment and rage. But he is relentless in his pursuit of these smug, smooth criminals, and it's his determination and flinty toughness that make you root for him even when he flouts numerous laws and morals to bust the crooks. William Friedkin's direction keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, and almost every scene is memorable, just perfectly constructed. ""The French Connection"" also captures the dirty, corrupt NYC of the early '70s, when crime was rampant in many quarters and cops were often as rough and nasty as the perps. Watch this movie and then watch it again.",The French Connection
181,the_mad_mckenna,Picking your Feet in Poughkeepsie,10,4 January 2003,"Besides owning a similar metallic brown '71 pontiac (mine was a 2 door) to the one in the greatest chase scene ever filmed, this film really portrays the dirty, dangerous, grimy NYC of my childhood. You can feel the cold of Hackman as he watches the drug smugglers eat a gourmet meal while he eats a slice of Pizza of the street. The music, camera angles, edits, performances - everything is fairly jarring and really brings you into a grimy underworld. Gone were the police dramas of perfect cops or criminals suffering because of what society has foisted upon them; instead, we're left with a job to do, and we root for popeye and the cops to put the bad guys away, warts and all. A top-notch effort.",The French Connection
182,bretttaylor-04022,Gritty New York Cop Film which was a sign of things to come.,8,14 August 2021,Gret location filming in both Marseille and New York which really gives you a feeling that you are in 1971 New York. This has great cat and Mouse type tactical chase scenes aswell as full pelt in New York traffic chase scenes. Gene Hackman is excellent as Popeye Doyle. There is a large shipment of drugs coming from France to New York and the detectives have a small grocery store as their lead.,The French Connection

184,crazyrabbits,A letdown...,5,3 June 2006,"After watching the film ""The French Connection"" tonight, I couldn't help but wonder if the scriptwriter was asleep for most of the writing process. The plot is paper-thin, the characters are shallow and lifeless, and the ""action"" scenes are pretty corny. For those of you who haven't haven't already seen the movie, the film is about two Narcotics Division police officers from New York chasing down members of a drug cartel.Of course, that only happens in the final half of the movie, because the first half of the film drags like a mule. The whole reasoning behind the uncovering of the drug operation is incredibly stupid. I mean, are we to believe that these two cops get jealous of an already convicted felon, then proceed to run all-night stakeouts on him? Do you realize how idiotic that sounds? Yes, they do uncover the operation, but it's only because of sheer foolishness on the villain's side. First, Alain Charnier deliberately leads on Doyle into realizing that he has shady motives, then he gets his hit-man to shoot Doyle in broad daylight! The much talked-about chase scene was good...back in 1971. Now, not so much. It's simply Doyle driving really fast down the street while avoiding vehicles. As for any other action scenes, they are few and far between.I also thought the ending of the film was a letdown. It only feels like the plot pulls itself together in (literally) the last 10 minutes. What, are we to believe that Charnier drove his vehicle, without anyone tailing him, to the warehouse to make the deal, and all the police were waiting and biding their time for him to come over the bridge so they could arrest him? How could they know that? It seems like the writers were just rushing to tie plot threads together, such as the shooting up the other cop in the last minute, and the ""title card"" ending.One thing that was impressive about the film was the acting. Gene Hackman and Roy Schieder give excellent performances for the threadbare characters that are given to them. We barely even know anything about these guys, and yet, the looks and actions they convey tell more than their words can even say. The supporting cast is largely forgettable, and I personally couldn't pick out anyone notable.There are numerous plot holes in this film. A couple of notable examples include how it makes no sense how Charnier's car is taken apart (literally, piece by piece), and then put back together in four hours. It also makes no sense how Charnier got away from the police who surrounded the building at the end.I am also surprised at some of the character's behavior. I didn't realize that you could put around-the-clock surveillance on someone that might not even be guilty, on the basis of a ""hunch"". I also didn't know that you could walk into a bar, tell of the African-American patrons to stand against the wall, then berate them and call them derogatory names while searching them. I also found it funny how no one even cared that much when people were shot, even when it was an old woman or car crash victim. Finally, was Doyle even charged with reckless driving? Christ, he almost killed a woman and child, smashed into cars and shot a man in broad daylight. Unbelievable.On the upside, the cinematography is quite astounding, despite it taking up most of the film. Many of the shots feel gritty, washed-out and realistic, and, to be fair, there's none of that CGI stuff going around like in so many Hollywood films today.However, I refuse to believe that this film won a Best Picture award. William Friedkin should have handed it back to the Academy.Bottom Line: I have a feeling people will down-vote this for being mean-spirited towards the film. I don't care. It's slow, plodding and yawn-inducing. If you like this sort of film, more power to you, but I could do with less of these kinds of films.",The French Connection
185,KingBrian1,très bon la connexion française,9,22 December 2014,This film is a conspiracy thriller about smugglers and their plan to import over 20% of pure drugs into the United States from Marseilles. Detectives Popeye and Cloudy are searching the bleak depressing streets of New York in this classic 70's classic. Overall what we have here is a fascinating and well-constructed story detailing the drug trade. The plotters involve small town crooks Sal and his girlfriend posing as storekeepers to conceal their criminal rackets. Detective Popeye requests extra surveillance from Supervisor Walt Simonson wanting to connect this small operation with mobster Weinstock. Meanwhile as this is going on the real orchestrators on the other side of the Atlantic are busy shipping drugs into the country by using French film maker Henri Devereaux's car. Once in the US a Car buyer working on the orders of Sal purchases the vehicles at the scrap yard to be used to transport the drugs around the city. With Detectives trailing Sal and now a new player on the scene the unknown Charnier we learn that the drug traffickers are already aware of police presence and a chemist has already tested the validity of the drugs. The two detectives grow frustrated and exasperated by both their inability to trace the drugs to the offenders and Agent Mulderig who is constantly berating an ill-tempered Popeye. Soon they find their smoking gun. An assassins strike leads to a chase across the city followed by a chase between a car and a train.Determined to catch the drug traffickers they continue their surveillance until and last they cease the car and discover the stash. As the movie ends the cops swoop in on the drug trade while Charnier seemingly escapes leaving Popeye and Cloudy in a whole lot of trouble. From start with the assassin disposing of his enemy to finish with detectives storming the abandoned building this movie is at times shocking but very intense and enjoyable to watch. I rate it better than most 007 movies and much more realistic. The Bond movies don't come close in terms of realism. This film reminds me of another great 70's hit Shaft. très très bon.,The French Connection
186,denigmatic,Maybe this is what they called a classic action movie,7,30 September 2021,"When i first watch this film i have a very similar atmosphere with scorcese Mean Streets but as the movie going is getting different.

The characters are not realized and the story, and lack there of, moves along as if it was crafted by a five year old.  I am going to sum up the movie here in a quick sentence.  There is some surveillance, then some chasing, then some surveillance, then some chasing, then more surveillance, then an even longer chase, then some shooting and the movie ends.I feel that a good car chase is one thing, but when there is just too much of it, it loses all its luster and becomes dull.  That is the case with this movie.  5 out of ten, because at least it started off with promise.",The French Connection
188,Majid-Hamid,gene hackman & roy scheider are at the best !,10,1 February 2008,"To my opinion,i do really think that this is one of the most finest crime movie which have been made in history. There is no doubt that Gene Hackman has show a great performance in this movie,and sure, he deserves an Oscar as one of the best actor in the world. I really would like to compare this movie with other crime movie such as DIRTY HARRY, DEATH WISH, AND SERPICO,which i found that THE FRENCH CONNECTION is the best among of all the listed movie..it is not said that those movies are not good(for i admit those are some of the most best crime movies ever),but it is only that THE FRENCH CONNECTION are a better ones compared to those.Gene Hackman has been good enough to give a pure performance as detective popeye, but there is no doubt that Roy Scheider has been very good in this movie. I guess that this is the best performance in his carrier(which is undoubtly move over JAWS)where he won an Oscar for best supporting actor in THE FRENCH CONNECTION.So..what more i can say about this movie? Nothing..expect,the best..great movie and the best!10/10*****",The French Connection
189,vg40,It's just an average film— 6.5 or 7 out of 10!,7,9 June 2011,"Yesterday evening, I began watching this film with two of my friends (Mughni and Shashank) in my room on my 20"" Philips LDC monitor. We stared with a lot of enthusiasm as I had read the reviews (including by Roger Ebert) and knew that it had won five Oscars. We anticipated viewing pleasure as we started.Twenty-eight minutes into the film, and we grew tired of it! This was the common feeling in three of us. A lot of US slang expressions, Americanisms and delay in building tempo and lack of special stuff to mark it off from an ordinary film were the reasons that disappointed us. (We are from New Delhi, India and I write this to make our prejudices clear.) I don't think non-US crowd will like it so easily; it just didn't live up to the hype for us.We stopped the film at the 28th minute. However, I finished the film alone few minutes ago.I will give it 6.5 or 7 out of 10. It's good but nothing great or very special. So the enormous praise really confuses me. It's just a good film relating to chase, crime and exploration—don't expect much from the film. I have seen better films in the same genre but they aren't so famous as this one! My friends even commented that it may have got so many Oscars due to lack of competition in that year! Gene has done a good job in the film but it's not an Oscar-worthy role. A 'so-so' film, to use an Indian phrase.",The French Connection
190,Lumpenprole,interesting,9,6 December 2002,"Picking up the dvd of Friedkin's THE FRENCH CONNECTION in 2002 is probably a weird experience for a lot of people.  It's got Gene Hackman on the cover wielding a gun with an expression that says he's about to shoot someone full of holes.  It is a cop film and it does have car chases, but the almost everything else about the film defies the expectations that audiences now have of the genre.  It's like watching LOGAN'S RUN, SOLARIS or ZARDOZ. After STAR WARS, the whole idea of an intellectually or philosophically ambitious sci-fi movie practically vanished.  I don't like ZARDOZ or care much for LOGAN'S RUN, but the point is that after growing up on sentimental fantasy epics like Star Wars, the very idea of people trying to be daring in sci-fi seems suspect.THE FRENCH CONNECTION suffers from a similar dissonance with a lot of people who find the film lacks plot and excitement.  Police dramas, and especially television cop shows, are massively plot driven where THE FRENCH CONNECTION is a character driven.  Where most action films follow a McGuffin, wind up for a heist or propel themselves towards a final shootout, THE FRENCH CONNECTION is designed so that all these things are secondary to observing Popeye Doyle's wrath.  The drama is watching his bullying, his indifference to almost anything or anyone but his job beating and killing people. Assassin on the run?  Drive right through everything in your path.  Frog trying to give you the slip?  Walk right up to him (even if you haven't anything to charge him with).  Time to arrest him?  Shoot everything that moves.  There is no arc or maturing of his character and at the end of the film he simply charges into a fetid darkness shooting at shadows.  It's a tremendously grim finish (which is underscored by the subsequent role call of characters where the cops are punished and the drug dealers get off).Another jarring thing about THE FRENCH CONNECTION is it's documentary-like attention to detail.  The events of the film are based on two real cops who handled a case that was plundered for the details that inform the plot and the police procedural scenes.  Like Altman's mix of reality and art in NASHVILLE, Friedkin mixes in real locations, real cops, real traffic jams/accidents and tried to base almost every scene on some real event. The result is a snapshot of New York in decay.  It's the post-Moses New York where landlords burned down their buildings to collect the insurance rather than bother renting them.  In 2002, this doesn't really come across because corrupt police dramas in gritty neighborhoods are a cliché.  A decade of COPS and untold thousands of B-movie dramas (`He's a Cop on the Edge!') have gone a long way towards defanging the sight of a racist cop beating the snot out of a black man over a handful of drugs.  The whole emphasis on realism, the idea that the filmmaker is trying to show what's interesting about a certain place and time, is an almost bizarre idea in an age when `seeing something new' almost always refers to a new innovation in CGI effects.It's still an extraordinary film, though one has to meet it halfway since the genre is so diminished.  Hackman's performance is pretty much universally praised for good reason.  He makes an amoral, loathsome, dangerous jerk eminently watchable.  Fernando Rey is up there with Laughton and Mifune for me - when he's on screen he's interesting.  It's a film made by extremely ambitious and creative young men.  Some of these shots would simply never happen today.  The insurance people would never sanction the mayhem and the NYPD would never cooperate on a film about a thug with a shield.It's obvious why it beat A CLOCKWORK ORANGE incidentally.  As perfect a film as CLOCKWORK is, it's a cerebral, shocking, stylish, and unique film. Best Picture doesn't go to films that far ahead of the pack.  THE FRENCH CONNECTION was a topical genre picture with a great performance and some very well realized artistic ambitions.",The French Connection
191,advaitkamat,"Tense, exciting and sensational.",10,30 December 2012,"""The French Connection"" is one of the better thrillers I've seen in a while. The movie, which starts with a chase on foot and ends with a chase on foot, serves its purpose by giving us what it was meant to give : undiluted excitement. And I'm not exaggerating when I say that it could well be one of the best films I've ever seen.Detective Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner Buddy 'Cloudy' Russo (Roy Scheider) are in the Narcotics Department of the NYPD. While having a drink at a bar one night, they see a man Salvatore 'Sal' Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife surrounded by drug peddlers and Doyle is at once interested in tailing the new guy. They start following him day and night for a week and wiretap his house until they overhear him tell somebody that a shipment, presumably drugs, was due to arrive in a week's time. Doyle and Russo continue to tail Boca for more clues when they find that he often meets up with Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), an accomplice in the smuggling of drugs inside the country. The film's plot revolves around these stories : Boca's and Charnier's attempts to smuggle the drugs inside the country, Doyle's and Russo's tabs on the two and the involvement of a famous French actor Henri Devereaux (Frederic de Pasquale), who is responsible for smuggling the drugs inside the country.You can't help but be rapt while watching the tensely atmospheric, intertwined stories seamlessly edited by Gerald B. Greenberg. Director William Friedkin pays great attention to the little details (like Doyle's trivial hat on the backseat) and the finer nuances (the periodic pauses while chasing suspects by the two officers) of the characters, while keeping an eye on the dense plot. That's a skill which few directors can boast of. The film is full of chase sequences, both by foot and car, which are supremely well-directed. The screenplay, based on the non-fiction book by the same name by Robin Moore, is neatly adapted by Ernest Tidyman. The dialog sounds authentic, often speaking volumes about the characters by saying so little. Tidyman does a magnificent job of pulling off a story where people observe each other more than they talk.One of the film's greatest strengths is its cast, wherein every actor turns in a convincing performance. Scheider and Rey are fantastic in their respective roles but the star of the film is Hackman, who gives one of the best performances ever, with his striking screen presence and raspy voice, Hackman is precisely how Doyle's supposed to be : a pugnacious and imperious Narcotics detective. It's one of those performances where you can't imagine anyone else playing Doyle except Hackman. He lives the character.How can anyone talk about ""The French Connection"" without mentioning the spectacular car-chase through the streets of Brooklyn where Doyle chases an elevated train to deter a hit-man from escaping? The chase has got it all and it's all too real. You have Doyle crashing his car into a sidewall, getting his rear-view mirror blown fall by a truck and almost hitting a woman with a baby stroller. At the end of it, you see a limping Doyle pretty shaken by everything that transpired. Friedkin handles the chase with an uncanny eye for realism, like Doyle's limping and his confusion when things do not occur the way he expected them to. The sequence will leave you breathless.I can't seem to find anything wrong with ""The French Connection"". It's an exuberant thriller, positively quivering with wicked excitement, which richly deserves the highest of praise.",The French Connection
192,montferrato,Psychopathic Cops Versus Sophisticated Gangsters,8,20 January 2011,"This is quite a good movie. There are several things that make it interesting: 1. Who is actually the Bad Guy? Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) plays a compulsive, maniacal, bizarre and extremely violent cop, whose obsession to bust Alain Charnier(Fernando Rey, the aristocratic-looking Spanish European actor) borders psychopathy. The behavior of Hackman is so ruthless, compulsive and violent that inspires a profound dislike. This is amazing, because the bad guy(Fernando Rey), looks far less compulsive, obsessive and crazy. He is a cunning, sophisticated and extremely ambiguous criminal, described as ""the shrewdest cat i have ever seen"". In this way, the behavior of Hackman is canine, as he behaves like a Doberman with an overdose of steroids, in contrast with the Frenchman, who is more feline, like an elusive cat. This contrast is really fun to watch, because Hackman the cop is depicted as a man with a personality bordering insanity, while the gangsters are portrayed as far more rational and sane.2. The Action is good.Very good action scenes, and a good job of all the crew. Roy Scheider is great, as it is too the almost unknown actor who portrays the Frenchman's personal hit-man.The scene where Hackman chases the train in a car is fun, and it is intense, despite it does not make much sense.I would remark the excellent interpretations of Gene Hackman, a very good actor, and also the interpretation of Fernando Rey, the elusive , cunning and very slippery Frenchman.Excellent movie",The French Connection

But that doesn't go down as they'd hoped.

The two leads are in top form and do what is asked of them. They play these cops very realistically.William Friedkin directed the film at a young age and proved that thrillers were still great fun and great movies.The film won five Academy Awards including Picture, Director, Actor, Adapted Screenplay, and Editing.

195,alexsnower,Hackman's best movie,10,29 June 2021,"When I first watched The French Connection I was slightly underwhelmed. It was a few years ago and I thought it was decent but the end was perplexing to me and Popeye seemed unsympathetic. Than about a year ago and a half ago at the start of quarantine, I decided to watch again. Oh man did it blow my mind! I have seen it 3-4 more times since than and it's become one of my favorite movies from the 1970's. Popeye seemed unsympathetic to me as he was a cop who went way beyond the boundaries of police brutality. However, after rewatching I have come to view Popeye as captain Ahab. His obsession with finding the ""Frog"" (French drug dealer) results in a mass shootout and beautifully shot car chase with the Frenchman's sniper(who kills at least 3 civilians) . Popeye is able to take the perp down with a shot to the back while he was running away unarmed. Popeye at the end also shots an Police officer dead after mistaking him for the Frenchman (Charnier). In the result of the case no charges stick and Charnier escapes. Popeye is reassigned out of narcotics. You might look at Popeyes investigation as a complete failure but it's unlikely any other detective would have been able to even know about the drug deal that was taking place. This makes Doyle ""Bad news but a good cop"" . If you haven't seen this you must!",The French Connection

Maybe back in 1971, this was cutting edge, but today it just didn't cut the mustard.   I actually really enjoy older movies, but this was not one of them.

197,ericolsen1953,Come on! I won't hurt you to see something involving The French!,10,17 January 2005,"The realism of this movie made it an instant classic. Several directors had tried, but Wm Friedkin succeeded in fine style. To see The French Connection is like spying right into people's lives. There's some draggy parts and some uninteresting characters, but that's life and that's some people, so it works. Most of the characters and action are believable, even if not one in 10,000 police officers ever have as nifty a chase scene as Hackman has running down his would-be assassin through the grimy, neglected streets of 1971 New York City. There's some spot-on social-comment in this film, too. Know-it-all Federal cops have all the funding, while street-brawling policemen like Doyle and Russo, who actually crack cases, have tiny budgets. Big-time crooks sit in fancy cafes, eating $100 lunches while cops tailing them choke down bad pizza-by-the-slice. Productive, tax-paying citizens in the most-important financial center in the world (NYC) have to put up with nasty street criminals, a liberal-nanny-local- government and a crumbling infrastructure. I felt concern for the El-Train Motorman's family when he keeled over dead from a crime- induced heart-attack.

198,DC1977,Over rated,4,8 November 2002,"I don't have much to say about this film that hasn't already been said in the earlier comments.
This has to be one of the weakest films to have won the Best Picture Oscar (what about A Clockwork Orange? Flawed, yes but certainly better than this) and also includes one of the least deserved Oscar winning performances - Peter Finch was robbed.I'm a great admirer of Gene Hackman (one of the best actors of his generation) so it's ironic that his most famous role winning him the biggest award of his career is, in my opinion, his least convincing performance.
He's miscast, director William Friedkin didn't want him, believing him to be wrong for the part and understandably so.
It's been said that Hackman was supposedly the sixth choice to play Popeye Doyle but according to Friedkin, he was the only choice and Friedkin took him because otherwise he would have lost the film.I have a higher opinion of The French Connection than when I first saw it five years ago on an old and battered tape that had no subtitles. This mean that the dialogue scenes between the French characters drove me crazy. I didn't realise until I saw it again that the film DID have subtitles but they had been inexplicably removed from the VHS version.One thing I would like to point out that I don't think anyone else has mentioned (which amazes me) is the extremely irritating end to the film.
We are taken straight from the action at the site of the drug deal to a series of stills outlining what happened to these fictional characters but doing it as though it were fact.Not only is this a major narrative cop out but it feels very odd to deal with fictional characters in this way even if they are based on real life people. For example, there is no drug dealer called Alain Charnier (nicely played by Fernando Rey) so how can he be believed to be living in France?He doesn't exist!Its the sort of ending that makes you wonder if Friedkin ran out of either money for the production or film for the camera.
The sequel, which has no plot and makes the original look like a masterpiece, has an even more abrupt ending but that's (obviously) another story...I suppose in fairness to Hackman, he should deserve some credit for being able to keep a straight face whilst uttering the appalling line: 'You took off your shoes, put your fingers between your toes and picked your feet, NOW DIDN'T YA??!!?' but there's nothing Oscar worthy about his performance and I'm surprised he was even nominated.",The French Connection

200,stevenfreekin,One of the most overrated films of all time,10,29 April 2014,"This film was ground breaking at the time, and it still is today. The movie amazingly holds up today because of its high standards. It introduced audiences to on the fly police investigation. What's interesting about the film is that the criminal is more of a stand up citizen than the police officer, it also nicely documents New York city in 1970/71. It's such an iconic film in terms of action, police drama, and style.William Friedkin brought to mainstream cinema, at the time, his signature style of Induced-Documentary; which is now abused to the extent that it becomes amateurish. Although if used for the right reason, like The Shield, which is pretty much French Connection as a TV SHOW, it can be something great. As much as Friedkin hates movies today based on comic books, toys, video games, and remakes; he's partially to blame. His films and The French Connection in particular are always cited as the realist basis on which most of these films and shows are based on (The Dark Knight Trilogy, Man of Steel, 24, The Shield, Breaking Bad, Iron Man films, Captain America 2, The Bourne Trilogy, CSI, etc). Don't even get me started on the car chase, because i can write a thousand page paper about it.",The French Connection
201,parkerrodney,A Marker for Mediocrity in the Evolution of Movie Making,3,3 August 2018,"Shot in NYC in the early 1970s the French Connection is a gritty police drama about 2 NYC police detectives assigned to the Narcotics Bureau who happenstance upon plans of a major drug deal taking place involving drug king pins from France and NYC local Italian drug dealers. The screenplay captures the seediness of life in NYC in the early 1970s, during the days of John Lindsey's administration, long before the clean-up, gentrification, aggressive policing and the real estate boom. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider co-star brilliantly as they portray rough edged cops who engage in foot pursuits and car chase scenes throughout city streets, highways and the NCY subway system. The movie provides viewers with extensive views of the streets of Brooklyn and Manhattan during the 70s. Although the movie is considered to be a classic, the storyline itself is thin, and the ending weak compared to today's standards. But if you're a fan of movies like ""The Seven Ups,"" and ""Bullit,"" the French Connection may suit your taste. 
While the French Connection received some 15 plus awards including an Academy Award in 1972 for best picture, the by today's standards the screenplay would never have been made. When the movie came out in 1971, I was 12 years old and everyone thought it was a great movie, young and old. I believe the reason for this is that graphic violence, realism and chase scenes were being introduced into movie making. In retrospect, it can only be said that it was a great movie during its day, but certainly it's not a great movie in the history of movie making. Don't set your expectations too high for this one, the French Connection, at this point it can only serve as a marker for mediocrity in the evolution of film making.",The French Connection
202,amalank,Much better on second viewing but still does not meet the mark for me,7,17 November 2015,"I had heard about this movie being a classic actioner featuring a classic car chase and having won 5 Oscars. Eleven years ago I watched this movie when it came on TV. At the time I thought it was the worst movie I had ever seen and was so baffled as to how it could be so popular. I felt it was just a series of random events put together and so deeply disappointed by the so called classic car chase which was just a car driving fast underneath a trainline. In my previous review for this movie I actually went as far as rating it 1/10.However there have been a number of movies which I enjoyed more after a second viewing including Batman Begins, Alien and Point Break. So I finally decided I would give The French Connection another go.I will admit it was much better than my first viewing. However I do not think this is a good movie, let alone a classic. There was a storyline which was OK although it did get a bit disjointed at times. Gene Hackman did a good job in his role as well. There was no score for the movie which would have made it more intense. There was of course still little action and I was still a bit underwhelmed by the car chase.While it is something you can watch if you've got nothing else to do, for me it does not qualify as a great movie. My opinion is you'd be better off watching Dirty Harry released the same year or Ronin which I think are far better movies.",The French Connection
203,kdavidbushnell,"Good movie, I see how it's a classic.",8,30 July 2009,"For it's time it is very good cop thriller/drama. A one of a kind! The beginning starts off pretty fast, then it gets kind of slow for a while, the endless chasing got almost boring until I realized that is what much of the story is about, the chasing really grows on you (me). The characters are good and colorful, Gene a little racist (I wonder how the real Popeye was). I guess the real Popeye is in the movie in some scenes. Anyway the last forty-five minutes are an absolute thrill and the end is killer. Very unpredictable, original copper flick. Pretty entertaining and as a whole it's a good but not great movie, but for it's time it must have been just awesomely amusing, and it still pretty much is.",The French Connection

205,Bud_Sturguess,Innovative crime drama set the stage for many to come,10,21 January 2003,"Based on a true drug bust in the early sixties, two of New York's roughest narcotics agents, Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Cloudy Russo (Roy Scheider) stumble onto what becomes a relentless, tiring investigation of a drug shipment with a connection to a French crime boss (Fernando Rey). The performances by the entire cast are gritty and believable, including those from Eddie Egan and Sonny Grosso, the two real-life cops the film is based on. Hackman's relentless portrayal of rogue cop Doyle won him the first of two Oscars, and William Friedkin's innovative documentary-styled directing garnered him the Best Director Academy Award. ""The French Connection"" set the stage for many gritty crime dramas, and remains unmatched as an innovative and brutally realistic film.

The grittiness of the streets and the general feel of the neighborhoods are captured in every scene. This film is based on a true story and is so real that the actual detectives who this story is based are in the movie! This is a cop story like no other and (as has been stated endlessly) has possibly the greatest chase scene in the history of motion pictures. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider spent a considerable amount of time in patrol cars and accompanying New York policemen in preparation for their roles and their chemistry is unbelievably convincing and articulate. The script is outstanding and the production is extremely lifelike and gripping. To this day, it still stands up as a very well done detective drama with a very real ending. The fact that the story is true just makes the film that much more intriguing. My personal recommendation is the 30th anniversary DVD which contains a bonus, behind-the-scenes, disc with interviews and stories. Fascinating and very, very interesting. Probably my all-time favorite police movie. Highly recommended.",The French Connection
207,electrictroy,A *boring* ride,1,30 July 2005,"I'm 30-something... grew up with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, et cetera.... but I also enjoy the classics like Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane. They are slow-paced, but filled with tons of nuance and depth, and you can watch them again and again. Every viewing reveals something new, that you missed the first time.The French Connection doesn't have that depth. To me, it looks like the special effects blockbuster of 1971. Chase scene. Guns firing. Men running. Tough guys. Subtract all that, and what's left??? Not much. A middling story with shallow characters that leave me asking, ""Who cares?"" (Similar to Independence Day.) .I know, some people say, ""But it was fresh in 1971."" I'm sure it was. But *truly* great stories will still be fresh hundreds of years later. That's what separates the fad from the masterpiece.I don't think French Connection qualifies as a masterpiece. It was a fad. Like the hula hoop or bell-bottom pants, it made a brief splash, and then was overshadowed by later, better stories. It's not surprising that the younger generation would find these fads boring or silly.If you see French Connection on TV, try to find something else to do with those two hours.troy",The French Connection
208,Foopy-2,Uh... What was that?,6,27 October 2002,"I didn't enjoy this one much.The film featured very little character development--for instance, Gene Hackman acted pretty well, but I had no idea where his character's motivations were coming from, so I couldn't understand him or relate to him at all.  By the end of the movie, most of the characters were still in the exact same psychological state that they started in (they had no ""arc""). Since everyone was incredibly boring and flat, I never really got attached to any of them or cared about their fate.The plot was so-so; there weren't really any big ""twists"" in it and it wasn't particularly unique or provocative, which would be OK with me if it weren't for the fact that there isn't much else of interest in the rest of the film.Sure, the movie is ""gritty"", but that alone doesn't make a movie worth watching.  There are plenty of detective dramas I've seen that weren't as gritty as this, but the fact that they had excellent plots and/or interesting characters whom I came to care about made those movies vastly more entertaining than this one.  Put simply, there was very little in this film that drew me into its world, besides some beautiful cinematography and a great car chase scene--possibly one of the best car chase scenes I've ever seen, actually, but it still didn't redeem the movie for me.",The French Connection

210,Percivalx,The first of many to come!,10,6 December 2005,"In most movies, the good guys are portrayed as models for others, examples for a better life. The bad guys, on the other hand, are usually dirty rat scums. What a refreshing surprise to see that The French Connection has the roles loosely interchanged. Set against the backdrop of bleak New York City streets, ill-tempered narcotics detective 'Popeye' Doyle and his partner 'Cloudy' Russo intercept a drug shipment coming in from France led by urbane master criminal Alan Charnier. The two cops, however, have a hard time capturing the drug lord as he outwits them throughout the city. Popeye and Charnier make an interesting contrast. Popeye is portrayed as an obsessive, racist drunk while Charnier is the mellow, European sophisticate. This is, of course, an action thriller and the sequences are gritty, tense, and heart-pounding. It features one of the best car chase scenes ever filmed. What makes it so effective is the fact that it was shot in real-time, heavy traffic and we vicariously experience moment-by-moment. The acting is strong and believable. Gene Hackman's portrayal is exact and deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar. William Friedkin did a superior job in giving us a diverting and realistic look of cop life and the raw work they undergo to clear the streets of illicit activity. Great action thriller!",The French Connection
211,kostasxrysogelos,I Simply Adore This Film,9,11 August 2007,"A question to start With: whatever happened to William Friedkin? The man who gave us the dark masterpiece 'The Exorcist', the interesting remake of 'The Wages of Fear, titled 'The Sorcerer' and, of course, this unique piece of art. Anyway... sh*t happens.I love this movie. Firstly, it's one of the first real movies of the 70s, if you know what I mean. Many of the films released in 1970 were just the last days of the 60s: 'Five Easy Pieces', 'Hoffman', 'Patton' etc. 'The French Connection' introduces a new style that is, undoubtedly, the '70s style': Darker images, slower action etc.Secondly, Hackman is just astounding, and Scheider as well. And I really like the fact that F. Ray also stars.The real magic of the films lies on the fact that it's very naturalistic. Images from the road, with no intension of making them look better than they really are. The atmosphere of the film is amazing. In addition, the plot is very interesting and well structured. The ending is unexpectable and very dark.To summarize: An artistic triumph.",The French Connection
212,enddust,Masterful trend-setting cop drama,9,12 October 2003,"I don't believe this was the first gritty NYC cop drama ever filmed in the daring post studio-controlled Hollywood of the late 60s early 70s, but it certainly perfected a trend. Its famous car chase through Brooklyn was also not the first, but it has likely never been topped, despite numerous car chases in numerous crime dramas since, including those now aided by that awful showy but fake-looking digital animation (the disastrous Matrix Reloaded comes to mind). On a hunch one evening, veteran narcotics cop Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) eyes a suspicious table of ""greasers"" at an East Side bar/night club that he has dragged his married partner (Roy Scheider) to after hours. He and his partner tail the one ""big spender"" at the table only to find that he runs a candy/newspaper shop with his wife who was not the woman he was seen with running around town doing a drug drop with. Where is all his big money coming from? Intelligence gathered later at a mean-spirited shakedown of a working class black bar in town reveals that there are no drugs on the street and that a shipment is expected. Eventually, the cops are lead to a visiting debonair Frenchman whom they suspect is part of an illegal heroin shipment due to hit the streets involving, among others, the greaseball at the bar and a local drug kingpin. The rest is well-executed gritty cop drama with surveillances, a couple of shootouts, that classic car/subway chase, and the inevitable shootout/confrontation with the bad guys. I won't give away the ending but will say that it is unexpected and very original.The French Connection uses all the right archetypes: the unlikeable loser cop (Doyle) with a keen intuition about evil, the suave, detached foreign mastermind, the self-defeating conflicts inside law enforcement, and the tough reality of the streets. A sequel was filmed a few years later but it has none of the power or tautness of this movie. Hats off to a movie that makes you work a little to follow its plot without trying to be convoluted. This film won five Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Hackman), Best Director and Best Editing. A must see for any lover of good crime/action dramas. 9 out of 10 stars. . .",The French Connection
213,witness-7,"No, they really don't make them like they used to",8,26 May 2003,"The challenge with old movies considered classics -- the Citizen Kanes, the On The Waterfronts -- is that it's sometimes hard to discern the masterpiece within the context of the time of their release. The greatest impacts of many films have become formula ever since -- repeated over and over again and even embellished each time.This is one of those movies that still captures a bit of its impact despite the years. Sure, there's a thin plotline. The acting is a little over-the-top at times -- even if it is great overall. The chase scenes have been diluted over time, but there's cat-and-mouse suspense that still pulls you in.You can see how this movie influenced a great number of network TV detective shows that followed -- even if you couldn't get away with a lot of movie language and violence on TV.More surprising was the realization that this is a film that I could not see being made today. There would be a lot more emphasis on the chase scenes, with more shoot-outs and explosions. And while the film doesn't give you any indication of the characters' lives beyond detective work, today the film wouldn't be released without some leading female love interest forced into the plot by Hollywood bean counters looking to up their 21-54 female demographic.Sometimes, if you look in the right places, you can find appreciation for a film's impact from another era.",The French Connection
214,peterlonglongplong,"Kind of fun to watch, but...",5,26 May 2007,"When I saw this movie in '71, I was a kid. It was fun to watch and the car chase scene was a real blast. In my older years though, I think this movie is quite ridiculous and filled with cliché-ridden events that are an attempt to spellbind the viewers. As one other reviewer commented, the hijacking of a car in NYC, and then driving like a maniac to keep up with the subway train that the hit-man was on makes no sense at all. A seasoned cop in New York City, being obsessed with busting an organized-crime smuggling king-pin using a Lincoln car from France as the carrier of drugs, hummmmm.... I don't get it..?.. Almost hitting a woman with a baby stroller.....I'm afraid that one's been used an uncountable number of times; and it originally comes from a silent movie. The odessa steps scene in the movie made in 1925 in Russia, ""Bronenosets (Battleship) Potempkin"", shows a woman get shot and lose her baby carriage. This is a famous scene that everyone who's studied film production in college has viewed. It alway will arouse strong emotions. Now I can understand the movies use of an arrogant, fanatic cop wanting to catch the ""BAD GUYS"". And in this movie, the BAD GUYS are so much more civilized than the cops. But to think that the police dept. would allow the officer to spend so much time and department's money on this; it make them look kind of dumb. The creme-de-la-creme of the preposterous episodes in this movie, to me, is the tearing apart of the Lincoln to find the drugs. Maybe they didn't have drug sniffing dogs when this movie was made, but come on...?... I'm not a mechanic, but I have done some work fixing parts of my car's engine and interior. I kind of doubt that in 1971, or even now for that matter, the NYPD is going to completely dismantle a car and put it back together, with no noticeable evidence of it's being tampered with, in four hours. Let's make it 12 hours. I'd like to see how fast the best mechanics in the world could thoroughly ransack a big vehicle, like a '71 Lincoln, replace all of the torn vinyl, metal, plastic, and wood parts, and then make the car look like it's barely been touched. The movie is a suspense/action/thriller and it's not painful to watch. But I consider it, in a way, similar to Commando. It makes no sense, but the story moves, even if it's completely ludicrous. At least Commando had some comedy in it.",The French Connection
215,ajmelck,"""True grime"" edge fails to save incoherent, visually impressive, and unlikeable film",6,6 April 2006,"Apparently William Friedkin was convinced that ""The French Connection"" was headed for disaster all the way through filming. But while conceding that the final result isn't entirely a rout, I would be cautious about the hyperbole that surrounds it.The best thing about the film is its raw, ravaged look. Everything is eroded, decayed, overused - the cities, the people and - perhaps a point of conjecture - the language that they use. One could go even farther surmise that the formulaic exchanges and clichéd situations that the film portrays are a critique of a worn-out, bankrupt society, but I'm not willing to let Friedkin completely off the hook.Because as others have pointed out, many of the elements so lauded in ""The French Connection"" were done earlier - and better - elsewhere. ""Bullitt"" in particular springs to mind as the model for the slowing-moving, moody European-style of police thriller that concerns itself with more than just the cops-and-robbers merry-go-round (another example would be Jean-Pierre Melville's ""Le Samurai""). But whereas Bullitt's silences and long, atmospheric takes bespeak classical poise and existential angst, TFC's leave me wondering whether it's deliberately scrappy or simply badly edited. In any case, for those who think that the name ""The French connection"" hints at homage to the nouvelle vague, prepare to be mildly disappointed.In terms of the acting I must admit that I found Gene Hackman competent and workmanlike: he really knows how to play unpleasant, loudmouthed, belligerent, hard-drinking (insert additional epithets as required) types. But the eulogies heaped on the role seem bizarre considering that you never really get beyond the fact that ""Popeye"" is a nasty, bigoted gun-happy cop. As for the other ""characters"" it's difficult to say much; the figures are ciphers and I for one didn't make too much of an emotional investment in what happened to them.It's probably worth seeing this film for the great footage of New York and the gritty camera-work, but beneath the surface the scaffolding is very bare in terms of plot and characterisation.

216,Fleapit,Five Oscars but what was it all about?,1,24 February 2002,"A prestigious production that gained five Oscars and numerous other awards in 1971 but I must confess that I could not follow it at all. I found that the dialogue was almost impossible to understand and was even incomprehensible at times. That apart other factors were to blame. The film was unconventional in being mainly shot outdoors on locale on the streets of New York. Perhaps Fernando Ray was intended to be different from all the other characters but the trouble was that he stood out like a sore thumb; so much so that his presence jarred. In an attempt to authenticate the French connection the cast included the French actor Frédéric de Pasquale who died recently, also the film was shot partly in France (Marseilles) again outdoors and legitimised with French dialogue and sub-titles. But it still failed to create the sought after atmosphere; in fact all these directorial devices failed. I found it hard to keep track of even the main characters; I kept asking myself who is the detective? Who is the crook? Too many of the characters resembled each other so I couldn't tell which was which. I could only keep track of the detective Eddie Egan (Gene Hackman)because of his conspicuous hat. It was all a horrible mishmash. The only good feature was the high speed car v. train chase which was expertly edited and came over really well enough to earn the film its one and only mark from me, although I got the impression that some of the shots were repeated. Incidentally it won Gerald Greenberg an Oscar for Best Editing. If I wanted to learn how to get an Oscar I would not have got any clues from this film.

221,gainestillinger,Sublimly gritty.,9,17 August 2009,"The most obviously beautiful thing about this film is that it captures the grime of 70s New York city so well. The picture is filmed through some kind of more-real-than-real tint-and-grain camera lense that chills the very room you sit in; wafts of car fumes, frozen street vomit and burnt onions stream up your nostrils and stay there as the ominous and discordant soundtrack (sometimes more akin to a horror movie) attacks your sense of comfort.We are in New York, 1971, and two tough-as-you-like narcotics cops, Hackman and Scheider, both modelled on real policemen whose story the film is based on, are about to stumble on something big. Popeye and Cloudy (Hackman and Scheider) like to work hard and party hard, which is where the film really begins: they spot a high roller rolling a bit too high and decide to tail him all the way back to his paper shop. Little do they know, there is a much bigger catch than this paper-roller and it becomes one big game of NYCat and Le Petit Mouse as they get closer to the French connection.We are taken through freezing cold days and nights of watching the bad guys with Popeye and Cloudy where the French baddies do little more than eat lunch and walk to and from expensive hotels. Yet, this is thrilling - to the last blistered foot and sauteed potato. And then, of course, there's the legendary car chase. What can be said about this that hasn't already been said, other than it was filmed entirely out of sequence and edited to Santana's 'Black Magic Woman'? A masterpiece of editing! The sheer fluidity and break-neckedness of the scene easily rivals Ronin, a much younger film with more technology and road permission, and Bullit, a slightly glossier and aged movie (by three years).The book 'The French Connection' is a superb piece of journalistic literary non-fiction that depicts Popeye as a red-haired Irishman with a vicious temper and an unwavering dedication to his job – Hackman's performance reflects this beaufifully. The sheer doggedness of Hackman's Popeye makes compelling viewing. His grit and determination complements and reflects the setting of the film sublimely. Scheider is also great; he provides an excellent counterpoint to Hackman's scruffy, brutish, ask questions later persona.Watch this film with an old, old, old glass of whiskey and some burnt onions in a hot dog bun.",The French Connection
222,aaditya-swaroop,Best Cop movie ever,8,13 October 2012,"5 Oscars and 3 nominations. Beat ""A clockwork Orange"" to the ribbon and deservedly so. This is a perfect cop movie - gritty, fast-paced, intense, no super-hero cops but realistic believable characters. Although the genre of this film is classified as action, but I think its as much drama as action. There were so many things brought together to make this a cinema classic. Popeye Doyle's character was etched in history by Gene Hackman's portrayal of the character - gritty, messy,intense, unremitting but also human. He didn't beat 10 goons, didn't have six packs. Just a regular hard working cop who goes after his hunches. He deserved an Oscar for this. Hackman's and Scheider's chemistry as two hard-ass NYC detectives was nicely written and acted.The live-action cinematography by Owen Roizman was one of the best I have ever seen. Simple things like a street chase (with hand held camera shot) where Gene is running after the sniper with the background sound of Gene's heavy breathing gave it the thrill-factor. The car chase was breath-taking - No fireworks, no cars flying like today's movies. Just 2-3 hits to cars on the road and a wall, and finally, a smashed car (that still drove). No adrenaline rush, just intense heartbeats - WOW! For a 1971 movie, this deserves an applause. The other shots and camera-work brought about a sense of realism to the movie. Many of the street shots were done with hand-held camera while others with normal industry crane-work, close-ups etc. The ruggedness of the camera-work made you believe that this is how my life also looks like.The direction, soundtrack and story added to the drama factor. The documentary film technique applied by Friedkin worked wonders. The high pitched background score wasn't used much except the beginning and end of the movie. The background sound was made to fill itself by sound of the street, dialogues and light background scores. Again, this added realism to the central plot. Hints of irony in the story were also made to stand out sometimes, like a simple shot where Gene was waiting for the frenchmen outside the restaurant. Gene was standing outside in the cold eating a slice of pizza with not-so-good tea/coffee while the bad guys were having delicious cuisines with best of the world drinks and hot tea. Makes you hate the bad guys and admire the hard working salaried cops. The ending where the frenchman runs away and justice is not served, was a bit abrupt and unexpected. It could have been more impactful. There was no hint in the movie's storyline about the system being unjust. But nonetheless, the ending did not corrupt the flavour and storyline. Summary - for its era, this movie was ahead of its time. It has been termed as violent by some, but I consider it as the beginning of an era of cop movies. Its a classic and worthy of the Oscars (and other multiple nominations). 8 out of 10 for me.",The French Connection

225,mpdmartin,Still one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made,10,21 December 2015,"Reviewed by Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook. Forty five years have done little to diminish the powerful impact of William Friedkins' superb crime thriller. Shot with an almost documentary style gritty realism, the film tells the story of the NYPD narcotics divisions' attempt to stop a huge heroin shipment reaching the streets of New York from France. Opening in the back alleys of Marseille, an undercover French police officer is assassinated by a brutal hit-man, Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi) on the command of wealthy French Criminal, Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey). Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million worth of heroin into the United States in the car of his friend, French television personality, Henri Devereaux (Frédéric de Pasquale) who is desperate for a cut of the money. Meanwhile in Brooklyn Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) are engaged in an undercover stakeout leading to another low-key arrest of minor consequence. The streets are clean which means something big is due. The question is when and where and by whom? Later that evening, whilst drinking in a local nightclub, Popeye observes petty criminal Salvatore ""Sal"" Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his wife Angie (Arlene Farber) at a table entertaining a group of mobsters with known narcotics connections. A painstaking surveillance mission begins and it soon becomes obvious the young couple are living a lavish lifestyle way beyond their humble means. Charnier, Nicoli, and Devereaux arrive in New York with Devereauxs' Lincoln Continental Mark III sitting in the docks packed with illegal drugs. A race against time begins for Doyle and Russo to crack the case before a deal is done. The shrewd Charnier very quickly becomes aware his every move is being watched and after managing to leave his hotel unobserved he is spotted by Doyle, leading to a tense chase on foot through the streets and subway stations of the city. Always one step ahead, Charnier leaves the exasperated policeman stranded on a station platform with a taunting wave from the departing subway train. Now dubbed ""Frog One"" by his adversaries, Charniers' patience is being tested by the inability to get the deal completed and the persistent cops. Nicoli is dispatched to eliminate Doyle but his failed sniper attack leads instead to one of the most exciting chase sequences in cinema history. With ""Popeye"" behind the wheel of a commandeered Pontiac Le Mans, racing through the New York traffic and Nicoli above him in an elevated train speeding out of control through the stations, the driver held at gunpoint, it remains a landmark moment in film history. Only 'Bullitt', with Steve McQueen, a few years earlier had come close to the sheer rush of the chase scene in 'The French Connection'. The role of Jimmy Doyle was originally offered to McQueen who turned it down, not wanting to be typecast in tough guy cop roles. It's difficult now to imagine anyone other than Gene Hackman playing the part. For all his flaws, and he has a few, Doyle is a good cop, even if his commitment to the case borders on the obsessive. Hackman deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar, with the film also picking up Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (Scheider) and Best Screenplay amongst others. 'The French Connection' remains a timeless classic. Highly recommended. Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook",The French Connection
226,mlouns,Mixed bag of good and bad,7,5 January 2006,"""The French Connection"" presents a period cop thriller in early 1970's New York.First, the good parts: Gene Hackman does a great job as a rugged, somewhat sleazy cop trying to do his job. His counterpart, Fernando Rey, plays an urbane Euro-crook, down to the heavy gray coat and accessory umbrella. And the rundown feel and stale smell of 1971 New York is done very well.There is a fantastic chase sequence of car vs. subway. The filming of it, from the car's bumper view as the car weaves between various obstacles, will really rattle your dentures. And the second half is really well paced, with some great setups and a couple good twists leading up to an appropriately cynical ending.The first half, though, is really not all that great, with not much to hold your attention. The plot in the first 20 minutes is pretty confusing, and to make it worse, Gene Hackman seems to mumble about half his lines. The script lurches along for a while before it finally gets going right around the subway chase scene.By the time it wraps up you realize that it was a pretty good film. But for it to have won 5 Oscars, 1971 must have been a weak year.",The French Connection

Funniest part of the film for me is seeing Gene Hackman dressed up as Santa Clause at the beginning, only disappointing part of this film is it drags on before any action is delivered to the viewer but great storyline, great acting and action. Roy Scheider is good as Hackman's partner and overall HackmAnn's performance as Popeye Doyle for me was much better and serious in French Connection II and the action was far more in the concluding sequel. The French Connection was good but French Connection II was far better and the fact Frog One disappeared without a trace at the end and no idea what happened to him, how he got away or where he was was a big disappointment. I like The French Connection but French Connection II was far better, more dark, nicer scenery and more action...

That isn't to say it's a bad movie (it isn't) but it really pales in comparison to most other Oscar winners. The biggest problem is the plot. It's so basic and straightforward that it would seem more appropriate in an average made-for-TV movie. It's entirely predictable and mostly lacking in any sort of suspense. The acting is good but the characters aren't exactly believable, including Gene Hackman's Doyle. Everyone is so stereotyped - the cops, the thugs, the drug kingpins, all of them. I've always thought ""The Seven-Ups"" (a sequel of sorts to this movie) is a much better movie and more worth your time.",The French Connection

Some reviewers have said this movie is boring, but I think they are missing the point. Were you expecting constant shootouts and random explosions like every other action movie? Or were you expecting gratuitous exposition like most Oscar-winning films? This movie is neither of those things.  The most important thing about The French Connection is that it is very real.  The gritty documentary look makes you feel like your really there, as does the realism of all the procedures.  Gene Hackman is great and so is Roy Scheider in an underplayed but excellent role as Doyle's sidekick.  My favorite scenes: the cat-and-mouse tailing of Charnier and of course, the chase.

I realize that it was made before all of the ""typical"" 70's (or 80's or whenever) cop movies, and that (i guess) it opened doors and whatnot.  Still, that doesn't keep me from thinking the movie sucked.Slow-paced.  Ridiculous continuity holes. Mediocre car chases (that don't really involve cars, just one car).  Gene Hackman was good.  Roy Scheider was good.  The rest of the movie wasn't.  Like when they tore the car apart and finally found the heroin in the rocker panels, put the car back together and it was as good as new.  Better than new.  They never evenAnd it's not that I don't like old movies.  There are plenty of movies taht I think are great. Movies made around the same time as Connection, like Godfather, A Clockwork Orange, Deliverance. (Actually, I didn't think Deliverance was that great).Allright, I'm rambling.

There is no coherent plot, the little pieces of the story told in the particular 'jazzy' way, the trick that attracts some attention at first, but then it becomes dull and predictable. The director obviously strived for 'tell it like it is' approach, but all he managed to create is dull and chaotic movie. The movie heavily borrows from ""Bullitt"", which I found dull as well. There is no suspense in ""The French Connection"". Gene Hackman's performance as a lead was a dud. I couldn't relate to his character at all - there's no internal drama, or really anything. The tagline - ""good cop""? The drinking, whoring, racial slurs, shooting unarmed people? No wonder NYPD is knee-deep in lawsuits up to this day.And a little bit of science fiction made it into the movie. It's clear that NYPD at the time made use of the time machine, because there is no possibility that you can rip apart the luxury car, including interior and the engine, and then put everything back so the car seemed untouched, all in 4 hours (!!!). The much talked-about car chase is just a long, long, very long car chase. The 'near-collision' scenes are so heavily cut and edited, that all appearance of the continuous chase is gone, and one might be reminded of the editing style of the 'made for TV' films. It wasn't worth to block all that traffic in Brooklyn to shoot it.One of the most overrated movies of the 70's.",The French Connection

Hackman is determined to get his man and of course we know of the subway scene where Ray & Hackman play mind games jumping in and out of the carriages, but Ray comes out on top. Frog 1(Ray) hires a hit-man who tries to gun Hackman down, but misses, hackman chases after his would-be killer, it ends up in one of the best car chases filmed, although it's car v overhead train. and this car chase IS as real as it gets, no stunt people were used, no streets were shut down etc, which adds to the excitement. the would-be assassin ends up being shot by Doyle(Hackman).Towards the end of the film Doyle find the hideout of the drug smuggled and frog 1, but once again frog 1 ends up outwitting doyle and escaping",The French Connection

For making this film and the Exorcist, William Friedkin gets a lifetime pass. As far as I'm concerned, he can make as many CSI episodes as he wants.Every single shot, every single line, every thing was pitch perfect. While some people point to Roy Schnieder's smart guy sidekick as the best acting in the film it's Hackman's hardcore bad-assery that makes the film the legend it is today.The best part? The film's gritty texture, where you can feel every hard gravel sidewalk and smell every sewer grate. New York City is alive in this film, a living entity and there's a point in the movie where it seems that not only is Popeye fighting every single drug dealer on two continents but the city itself.Even the film's downer ending leaves a good taste in your mouth. Popeye wins (sort of) but he doesn't feel like he wins, instead he's doing exactly what he's done his entire career: chasing some unknown dirt bag down a dark hallway.The very notion that this film realistically fictionalizes a series of actual events also blows my mind. There was a real French Connection, an actual car chase, a real set of rocker panels.But that's why it's so much fun and that's why this is one of the best cop movies of all time.

The highlight is still the car/train/assassin chase three-quarters of the way through in which every trick is pulled to outdo Bullit made three years previously and does this by simple dint of being more tense and involving. Hackman is excellent and lays the foundation of gruff decency that he has played endless times since. Schneider is the classic level-headed cops buddy. The best part of the film is the ending.

Nothing really wrong with the acting or the cinematography; the story is just too simple and it never gets to you. It doesn't even come close.I happen to like movies that have some emotional effect on me: unfairness, pity, revenge and (unreachable) love are themes that I usually appreciate.
The French Connection didn't have these elements and neither does it have other interesting themes. It's not Hackman's fault or any of the other actors, the story is just too average. If you want to see an excellent movie with Gene Hackman, I suggest ""Mississippi Burning"".",The French Connection

It's a gritty, realistic New York City cop adventure, with a terrific performance by Hackman. He truly is one of our modern acting treasures.Friedkin's grimy, gucky portrayal of NYC helps us understand how Doyle's total immersion in the worst of it has shaped his personality. And Hackman has an absolute field day barreling his way through.But why, oh why, do editors and directors persist in allowing utterly horrendous errors regarding firearms to get through? No revolver suitable for police duty as a primary weapon will accept more than six cartridges, yet Doyle fires eight (8) shots out of his short-barrel carry piece before he reloads. Utter garbage.

The French Connection is a turd. Like so many films of its era, it suffers from lousy character development, a wafer thin plot, and a ear-drum scratching score. (Seriously. Like nails on a blackboard.) Apologists will find no end of responses to these and myriad other criticisms, but I put it to you that it is not the audience's job to fill in the gaps in character and plot left by the writer and director.This is a film primarily about stupid people. Supercop Popye Doyle comes across as completely bumbling (as do many of his colleagues), and it is surely a rare hit-man that can fail to hit a stationary target using a tree (the trunk of which is thinner than the target) as cover. I could go on, but I would be wasting my time - you've already decided that I'm an idiot who is incapable of appreciating truly great cinema.

The French Connection is a very exciting movie about French people coming into our country and violently disrupting the law by dealing with illegal substances (drugs). This is probably Gene Hackman's best film, as he gave an outstanding performance as the tough detective ""Popeye"" Doyle. The blood and violence made pretty good graphics in the scenes for 1971 and the actors ""death"" skills were pretty well constructed too. The weapons used in this film, such as the hand gun, machine gun, and especially the pump shotgun, were extroadinary. This film was so entertaining, that the time passed by quickly. However, the end of the film was disappointing because it didn't have very good closure (I can't say any more about the end than that). Roy Scheidor's performance in this film as Doyle's partner was the best he has ever done besides Jaws. His lethal weapon in the final scene was the pump shotgun. The ""Academy"" recognized this film very well, giving the main awards of Best Actor- Gene Hackman and Best Picture, with other awards as well.

The French Connection was one of the best movies made during that time.  The atmosphere was incredible and even watching the movie, I could feel the depressing mood of the time.

Released in 1971, ""The French Connection"" was groundbreaking in so many ways, and I have not found many crime movies that can match its brilliance. Director William Friedkin gave the world one of the most gritty and realistic movies in existence, and even today it proves that it can stand the test of time.""The French Connection"" follows the experiences encountered by New York detective Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and his partner ""Cloudy"" (Roy Scheider) as they track a drug ring in New York that is coming from France. Most of the movie follows these tow detectives, along with the help of federal agents, tracking chasing down people related to the drug ring, which they barely stumbled upon. It is not the plot that that really makes the movie, but, as expected, everything that moves the plot along.Acting is one of the major assets that this movie has, particularly in Gene Hackman's portrayal of ""Popeye"" Doyle. I will not hesitate in saying that I find this to be Gene Hackman's finest performance, but there is even more to the performance than that. Gene Hackman makes Doyle, in my opinion, the greatest cop in cinema history, let alone the greatest ""tough guy"" cop. Many would give this credit to Clint Eastwood's performance as Harry Callahan in the ""Dirty Harry"" series, but I disagree on that point. ""Popeye"" is crafted by Gene Hackman into a hard edged cop, who may not be the best person to exist (racism and womanizing are some of his attributes), but he holds no boundaries in solving crime, even if it means endangering innocent civilians. Hackman definitely deserved the Academy Awrd for Best Actor that he received for his performance.Almost as equally magnificent in this movie are the technical aspects. ""The French Connection"" is filmed in the same style that documentaries are filmed, giving the movie a dirty, gritty, and realistic look, feel, and sound. Streets in this movie look just as they should, with no needless effort to glamorize them. Truly, it is a spectacle to behold.Just about everything this film is meant to do is done flawlessly. No actors in the movie really deliver on the caliber that Hackman does, but that is because there is not a moment to develop their characters. Like I said, much of this movie involves chasing, not character development. Do not mistake this as a complaint, however, as I actually support the way the movie is delivered, particularly in its legendary chase scene, where Doyle is in a car chasing down an Amtrac that has a French assassin on board.

The 1970s were an amazing movie period, especially for big city, real life dramas and cop movies. But this does not hold up to the 1970s brilliance. The camera work is pedestrian and assembly line. The music is awkward. Ninety minutes of watching Hackman follow Sal around a very seedy NYC. I am suspicious that the movie was an elbow reaction to Blaxploitation movies of the time and particularly to Shaft. It has only white main characters and is brutally racist. This itself is odd being that the French were very ethnically progressive in the 1970s. Doyle seems indeed to be an anti-Shaft creation and all of the academy awards reinforce my belief that Hollywood was very threatened by Blaxploitation and by African Americans in general. The amazing acclaim it received from the academy seems to be overly eager in its praise and extremely over-rated to a suspicious degree. The car chase was just a marketing gimmick to validate the acclaim to mainstream audiences. But the plot is generally very weak. The racism is rampant and except for Hackman and Scheider, the acting is very limited. Just like the ridiculous nickname and the poorly worked bully act, the main character leads the viewers down several dead ends. I was genuinely rooting against Doyle the whole movie. Especially after the scene where his partner comes to his apartment to pick him up and finds that he had sleep with an underage girl. In fact, this movie reminds me of the many hundreds of weak NYC 1980s TV cop shows and I believe it probably was a template for them. The ending was just unbearably weak and unbelievable. It really should have been filmed in France and included some French actors, script and camera personnel. They also could have scored better music and utilized it more dramatically. There was some great music being made at this time. They probably didn't do this because, again, I believe it was only a Hollywood racist response to Blaxploitation and the mainstream success of Shaft. Cops employing obvious tails and staring into windows, bumbling, beating up minorities and living out of unmarked cop cars. It really just doesn't hold up anywhere.

Those young directors like Sam Peckinpah, Martin Scorsese and Friedkin were telling their stories with a whole new palate of possibilities. Not created on a back lot or sound stage.I agree with some earlier comments about blurred character development. NYC is as much of a character in the French Connection as any of the performers. And it did spawn a TV series. (Kojak certainly copied much of the NYC backdrop tones)It's to easy to compare films as though they're on a level playing field.

Impacting me in 1971, Don Ellis's score, The car chase below the ""EL"", The Three Degrees in the nightclub singing ""Everybody's Going To The Moon"" NYC in all it's over-sized madness.

264,joeconrad-14797,"Iconic, Slick, Gritty, Miraculous",9,6 June 2021,"Watching The French Connection is like sitting on a stakeout, waiting for something to happen. The movie's rhythmic shots and subtly emotional score lull the audience to sleep. Like all good stakeouts though, the film whams the audience alert through intense developments in the plot. Hackman's leading character, a savvy and unrelenting New York detective, fits naturally into the rough, grimy NYC street setting. The setting gives the feel of a real, gritty New York that rivals that of Taxi Driver, a film made 5 years after The French Connection. The plot and editing equal each other in intricacy. As Hackman and his partner, played by Roy Scheider, uncover minute breaks in the case through painstakingly dutiful detective work, the camera miraculously retains presence and coherence. The cat and mouse game in this film is absolutely fantastic. While the plot often reverts to dullness, ingenious earthquakes of action always await the patient viewer. The iconic train/car chase scene is just one example of these earthquakes. Overall, the film is a cinephile's delight that fits snuggly in the year 1971. It bridges French films of the 60's and Classic American detective films with the raw, explosive films that immediately follow it later in the 70's.",The French Connection

Maybe in 1971 the reality TV aspect and gritty bad cop stakeouts were more interesting. This needed a plot, a script, and an editor.I love these actors and can't get how this happened. It felt like the interesting footage got destroyed and they still had to make a film out of it.It baffled us that this won the awards it did. I rented it thinking it had won awards, we nearly stopped it a dozen times because it was SO bad, then we joked that obviously I had this mixed up with another title.

I can't say I didn't like the film because it was really good in my point of view, but not perfect. The action is filmed very well and it's pacing is spot on. But in the first 15 minutes I paused the movie and looked up on Wikipedia what was going on. That isn't really a HUGE problem but I don't enjoy having to do that. The performances made by Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider feel real and they make you want them to win. There is only one more issue that I really didn't like was the ending. When the movie ends you will be asking yourself ""What else?"" There is a certain conflict that doesn't get resolved which really bugged me.

Definitely deserves to be on AFI's top 100 list. I would rank it in the top 25 though. The best movies really are from the 70's. They should continue making movies like that but they stopped and now they make overacted movies where they beat you over the head with same idea over and over.

272,olukotun,Grows on you with a dash of racism,8,20 July 2009,"I'd heard about this film for some time. I thought it was either about fashion or some sort of Audrey Hepburn comedy. I was surprised to discover that it was a very considered stakeout film.This is a gritty New York, with dirt and mud on the pavements, wild steam vents from the sewers, and fake blood that has a hot sauce quality to it. While America likes to imagine itself as the leader of the first world, this film reminds us that the sanitized New York of today is a very recent development.The story begins slowly, but before long I was captivated. The dialogue is sparse but very realistic, and I enjoyed the documentary-style footage. The soundtrack is the only assertive aspect of the film, in the sense that the music overshadows the images at times.Much is left unsaid in The French Connection, but the narrative is easy to follow. It assumes intelligence on the part of the viewer, which I appreciated. Hackman and all of the actors are extremely convincing. Even the mobsters exhibit fear and concern. In short, the characters are very nuanced.However, I take issue with the portrayal of minorities in the film. Hackman's character spits out racist drivel against Latinos and blacks, who are only really portrayed as dealers or car thieves. This remains true to his character, but as a person of color I still disliked watching it. My sense is that Hackman's role in 'The Royal Tannenbaums' deliberately echoed this performance, in which he assaults Danny Glover with similar bigoted slurs. Surely, he is acting but methinks he plays the part a little too well.--dejiridoo",The French Connection
273,elliotpav,One of the greatest Films ever made!,10,1 July 2011,"The French Connection is an absolutely brilliant piece of cinema, and definitely worth a watch. I am only 16, and think that this is one of the greatest films ever made. The documentary style cinematography (by Owen Roizman) is thoroughly absorbing and particularly effective during Popeye Doyle's (Gene Hackman in the best performance of his career in my opinion) interrogation of a suspect near the beginning of the film (featuring the famous ""Do you pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?"" line). William Friedkin's direction is superb, and this is definitely his greatest film (closely followed by The Exorcist). Of course, many people remember this film due to the incredible car chase sequence in which Popeye chases an elevated train in his car. This is easily my favourite car chase, and the chase on foot just prior to this is also spectacular. I am also extremely fond of the scene when Popeye and Cloudy (Roy Scheider) enter a bar in search of drugs, and this is where Hackman shines the most in my opinion. The epilogue is also extremely well put together, and Don Ellis' music is perfect in keeping with the gritty, downbeat ending. Almost all of the film is perfect. Admittedly it is quite slow in places, and I had to watch it a good 2 or 3 times to realise its true majesty, but boy am I glad I did! This film has massively inspired me as I want to be a filmmaker, and it is definitely a very worthy Best Picture winner, and well worth numerous viewings!",The French Connection

Watching it for myself, however, I just found it to be mostly boring. There were only a handful of scenes that were engaging: the scene with the drugs being tested; the train chase sequence; most of the ending, starting from the impound lot. I feel like you could cut out an hour of this film, and make something pretty good, but as it stands, the film makes poor use of its 104 minutes.",The French Connection

While boozing and whoring and rousting the shifty blacks our heroes violate half the articles of the bill of rights. They raid local black bars and search people without probable cause. They hijack people's cars on the street. They beat up anyone they want to.The film shows it's colors in a scene in which the effete verminous french enjoy a meal of escargot and roast beef in a fancy restaurant while our virtuous heroes on the make shiver outside in the cold, with lousy pizza and coffee so bad they have to pour it down the drain. Freedom fries indeed.Along the way there are lots of car crashes, preposterous events, and absurd situations.All the mayhem is OK though --- the bad guys are smuggling heroin. I honestly can't tell if the cops in an alcoholic stupor chasing the junkies around was supposed to be ironic or not, but I don't think so.This film supposedly influenced many of those that came after it; certainly the Bush administration seems to have taken it to heart.

The seventies was a haven of detective films and this one stands out from all the others as being the definitive cop flick of that era. It follows a slot pace in parts but that was the film style in those times, and much better than today's all-action rubbish. The French spoken adds to the realism, the plot is fantastic, the acting superb and the action gripping and tense.Hackman won an oscar for this role and its easy to see why- a ruthless detective whos strongarm tactics get results. The best parts of this film are the subway chase sequence, the brooklyn chase and the appearance of a well-known group of female singers in the Shea (sp?). The score by Don Ellis is creepy but extremely effective, and the villains are played extremely well by Lo Bianco, Rey and Bozzuffi.

279,ashishpulippara,"A gritty, realistic buddy-cop movie",9,20 February 2020,"Hollywood has a list of over-the-top buddy-cop films but what makes this movie stand out is on how they portrait the lives of undercover police officers in real life.
Instead of engaging montages of police peeping into the criminal world to extract any info we see Popeye and Russo, sitting in tight spaces and spending nearly a day in their car spying on their suspects. The movie is thus a slow-paced one. But once the other side realises that they got men onto their tails, the pace switches to that of a thrilling roller-coaster.
No review can't end without mentioning the iconic car chase scene-a purely ecstatic cinematic experience with top-notch editing that kept the adrenaline consistently high. Gerald B. Greenberg won the 1972's Oscar for editing, and he truly deserves that.
Gene Hackman as the grey-shaded Det. Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle is pure joy. The persistence in solving a case, and exhaustion Popeye deal with, were captured mesmerisingly well by this great actor.
In short, if you are a sucker for a good neo-noir crime thriller, just go ahead with this film.",The French Connection

I'm from '82 and just watched it for the first time (2020).To begin with. I could not stand the photography right from the beginning. Camera moving around like the guy holding it was drunk or tripping over; poorly zooming in and out; crazy stomach sick 180s and close ups that appeared to be searching for acne. Felt like a B movie.Then, the never ending cop-follows-drug dealer (be it on foot or by car) was tedious, repetitive and non credible. Popeye watches them eating, then shopping, then catching the subway, then going into the hotel, then buying groceries, then...Ok, ok, I got it!!!! The subway scene with Popeye and the French guy getting in and out of the train was ridiculous or just comic.And what's the matter with the over the top theatre like acting, screaming and fighting all the time between them and macho attitude from the cops? I just wanted to tell them to stfu.So, maybe there is a simple explanation: I'm too young, watched it too late and the movie has aged really bad and filming was done different.",The French Connection

The shoot outs were laughable.....Matter of fact there was none in the book!The character development was terrible if non-existent.

When the guy drove off in the car all I could think about was how unbelievably bad that scene was. It was hard to focus on the rest of the movie.And the iconic car chase was absurd. There is no way a car could keep up with a train, even with all the crazy driving. And why not just call ahead to the next train stops? It wasn't like the train could make a left turn somewhere.And that was the worst sniper ever. He misses the cop but hits the lady pushing a stroller, then he can't hit the cop ""hiding"" behind a tree that is more narrow than he is.And he guns down the cop he didn't like by accident?

What, then, does criticising it negatively achieve, when so many appreciate it as a masterpiece? I need to post my thoughts on it because the film simply irritates me! For me the films amateur 70s machismo (complete with mumbled, unintentionally hilarious dialogue) is cringe-inducing, full of gritty, rough-hewn cinematography (therefore making the film good right?) that speaks of a film trying to achieve realism for the sake of it, whilst important factors such as a coherent narrative are neglected. Gene Hackman has done far better performances than this, but hey, he gets to run after a suspect in a Santa costume and afterwards slaps him around a little bit in an alleyway. Again, cringe-inducing. And as for the much-touted car chase...where's the suspense in this scene? The dynamic of one car chasing another is lost as Doyle is chasing an elevated train instead, reducing interest in the chases outcome. Having Hackman's character charge only in one direction (mostly towards camera) lacks tension, unlike the classic chase in Bullitt that made excellent use of San Francisco's hills.",The French Connection
