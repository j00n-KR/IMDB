0,SnoopyStyle,Great kids but forget about the rom-com,6,11 January 2014,"Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is a degenerate gambler and a drunk. After some bad loses, he's in trouble with his bookies and he borrows money from Jimmy on one condition. Conor needs to coach kids baseball in the projects. He finds out that he needs to field a full team, but teacher Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane) is holding back a couple of the kids.Keanu is all jittery. It's very distracting, and not very attractive. The rom-com part of the movie is a bust. The character is a giant mess. The saving grace are the kids. They are the movie. It's the Bad News Bears with better kids characters and weaker adult characters. I just wish they forget about the rom-com, and cool down the gambling drama. I wish they put more of the kids' story in the film. Although I'm very glad to not have to watch the usual final championship game.",Hardball
1,claudio_carvalho,A Boring Movie,6,21 September 2003,"Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is a gambler with high debts with very dangerous guys. He spends his time drinking, gambling and scalping tickets. He accepts to coach a baseball team of kids from the poor zone of Chicago to get some money, pay his debts with `The Barber' and be not killed. There he meets the school teacher Elizabeth Wilkes ( Diane Lane  it is amazing how beautiful she became again after leaving Christopher Lambert). With the contact of these kids, Conor becomes a new man. I did not like this movie. First of all, it is plot supported by baseball, a sport not practiced in Brazil and therefore totally indifferent for me. Second, the character of Keanu Reeves is corrupted and nasty. The viewer does not become sympathetic with him. I did not see he training the kids, just bored on his spot and with minor interventions when the kids struggle between them. I believe baseball has some tactics and techniques to be trained and developed. Third, most of the boys have amateurish acting, grinning when they should not have to, for example. Last but not the least, there is no message in this film other them the redemption of the character of Keanu Reeves, only after he earned a big amount in a bet and paid his debts. Indeed I found this movie a little boring. Maybe Americans and fans of baseball may appreciate this movie more than I did. My vote is six.",Hardball
2,kosmasp,Playing Hard(ball),6,26 December 2020,"Keanu Reeves - he sure is no Coach Carter or any other of the inspiring coaches you may imagine. But he isn't too bad either. This may not be his best display or can not be considered his comfort zone, but he is likeable, even when his character chooses to act in a manner that should make us hate him. Sometimes for no apparent reason at all.But romantic dates turned sour/weird aside, coaching choices and a weird situation towards the end, where the movie goes dark and seems to turn to Keanu to make others feel better in a speech (cynics would call this the white savior complex or something along those lines) also not weighed in too much, this can be a fun watch. And it has a young Michael Jordan in it ... well that's what he's being called in the credits, but before you ask, you may know him better as Michael B. Jordan! Interesting that as a kid nobody seemed to feel this was necessary ... whether that had to do with a lack of confidence on anyones part or not, the distinction is better.He isn't the main kid lead here though, he is one of many. Still fun to see him act in this one. Keanu has some ""Bill & Ted"" moments .. or at least he seems that way at times, with flailing arms and all. Again try to detach yourself from certain things and you'll have fun with this movie. And if you are into R&B and Hip Hop the soundtrack will really give you something to cheer on ... great selection! Although even there one might ask, why they chose to include some songs in the movie (specifically one by DMX, that is anything but kids appropriate - Party up ... the bad words silenced or changed, as in we get the radio edit of it)! I started overthinking it again ... ok, just enjoy",Hardball
3,gavin6942,Not Awful,6,23 December 2015,"An aimless young man (Keanu Reeves) who is scalping tickets, gambling and drinking, agrees to coach a Little League team from the Cabrini Green housing project in Chicago as a condition of getting a loan from a friend.Keanu Reeves's performance in ""Hardball"" earned him a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actor (also for ""Sweet November""), but he lost the award to Tom Green for ""Freddy Got Fingered"". Interestingly, I see ""Freddy"" as a misunderstood masterpiece... and hardly think Reeves is bad in ""Hardball"" (whereas ""Sweet November"" is just a bad movie).One could complain that this film has the ""white savior"" problem, with a white man saving the lives (figuratively) of an all-black team. I did not have that issue. There are some familiar plot devices, but all in all it is an enjoyable movie... one that maybe should be re-examined.",Hardball
4,Quinoa1984,"Starts out Ok, then quickly unravels downward",5,29 September 2001,"Brian Robbins' Hardball is a movie that actually has a decent concept- a troubled gambler (Keanu Reeves) takes on coaching a baseball team in inner-city Chicago to pay off his large gambling debt.  Not bad, but then of course the film diverges into a pit of cliches, usual endings, and Reeves. This movie might have gotten a higher grade if not for Reeves.  The thing with him as an actor is that when he's good (Matrix, the Gift) he can be good, but when he gets a role like this (or like Sweet November for instance)  it's almost a near abomination.  One thing to point out that was a decent touch- the pitcher on the team (I don't remember the name) Reeves coaches listens to ""Big Poppa"" by Biggie smalls in order to pitch strikes. D+",Hardball

6,zardoz-13,"The people who made ""Hardball"" should be shipped back down to the minor league of filmmakers",4,6 February 2008,"Imagine what Hollywood would make if it combined ""The Bad News Bears"" with ""Boyz N the Hood?"" Or ""The Mighty Ducks"" got tight with ""Dangerous Minds?"" ""Varsity Blues"" director Brian Robbins and ""Summer Catch"" scenarist John Gatins cover ""Hardball"" with so much sap they should have called it ""Spitball."" This hopelessly derivative and shamelessly schmaltzy sporting fable offers little that hasn't been done better before, aside from its star appearing in such a movie. Hollywood spouts ideological gobbledygook through both dialogue and actions. ""Hardball"" rolls back time to the 'white man's burden' problem dramas. I haven't seen anything in the press about Spike Lee's reaction to ""Hardball,"" but I'm dying to know about his complaints. ""Hardball"" dodges the question why whites are coaching blacks in modern-day American team sports. Is this commentary about the paucity of black role models in contemporary America? ""Hardball"" mirrors the 1965 Moynihan report. Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan argued racism prevented African-American men in the ghettos from obtaining good paying jobs. Humiliated because they could not support their families, these men without self-esteem abandoned their role as husbands and/or fathers and fled, leaving their wives an awful burden. ""Hardball"" projects this image of African-Americans in Chicago's real-life Cabrini Green, more of a war-zone itself than a housing project. Lacking black father role-models for themselves, a team of foul-mouthed fifth graders bond with an amoral, compulsive gambler who smokes like a chimney, guzzles like a fish, and frequents sports bars. Baseball redeems oddballs in this bummer of a hardboiled sandlot saga. Reportedly, Paramount Pictures slashed the controversial R-rated version of this rough-hewn opus and wound up with a strongly-worded PG-13 rating. Nevertheless, Gatins' heavy-handed, tear jerking morality tale still comes out swinging.Prepare yourself for the worst if you waltz into ""Hardball"" hoping for a ""Cosby"" sitcom. This cynical, no-holds-barred, saga about social conscientiousness reforms the unsavory Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves of ""The Matrix"") after he agrees to coach the KeKambas, an impoverished Chicago Housing Authority Little League baseball club. Conor owes several grand to several bone-crushing thugs when he asks his arrogant stockbroker chum, Jimmy (Mike McGlone of ""The Brothers McMullen""), for a loan. Instead, Jimmy pays Conor $500-a-week to supervise a team of African-American misfits. Conor tutors two of them before their tough-minded Catholic school English teacher Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane of ""The Perfect Storm"") lets them suit up. Of course, each character boasts some trait or affliction that sets him aside from the others. A chubby athlete struggles with asthma; one wears glasses; another isn't old enough; and two brawl like bobcats. When Conor stages batting practice, these fifth graders watch the balls either bounce off them or fly past them. They ridicule each other without mercy. Conor cuts out the name calling, and the boys get down to business. Incredibly, KeKambas' pitcher Miles Pennfield II (Alan Ellis, Jr.) emerges as a strike-out ace. The secret of Miles' success is his Walkman and the Notorious B.I.G. tune ""Big Poppa"" that he listens to repeatedly and relies on for a sense of rhythm. Eventually, villainous opposing team coach Matt Hyland (D.B. Sweeney of ""The Cutting Edge"") forces Miles to remove them, and our hero suffers like Samson with shorn hair. The best example of Hyland's villainy occurs when G-Baby (DeWayne Warren), clearly under age, steps up to the plate for his first time at a crucial point in a game. Sadly, neither Robbins nor Gatins tap Sweeney's obnoxious coach for a greater source of drama. John Gatins' convoluted screenplay consists of two interwoven stories: the plight of the KeKambas and O'Neill's gambling habit. The overnight transformation of the KeKambas when Conor takes them to a ball game is as far-fetched as they are goofy.""Hardball"" hurls Keanu Reeves his most unorthodox role. As Conor O'Neill, he incarnates the most credible but contemptible character in his career. ""Hardball"" pokes fun at its hero but commendably keeps our anti-hero in peril. Robbins doesn't depict Conor in a complimentary light, until our protagonist undergoes his Biblical Paul-on-the-road-to-Damascus conversion and shuns gambling. Conor's transition from sinner to saint is outlandishly melodramatic. Typically derided for giving wooden performances, Keanu Reeves burrows farther into this role than any other.Diane Lane does wonders with her one-dimensional role. Since the kids trust Conor, she warms up to the lout. Robbins, who helmed ""Ready To Rumble,"" never lets the Lane & Reeves romance interfere with the action on the field. Their best scene together occurs at school when Conor accuses Elizabeth of liking him. This scene represents one of Keanu Reeves' closest scraps with acting. Pouring out personality, he indulges in elaborate gestures and facial expressions. Lane and he generate a modicum of chemistry, and they make a believable couple. The plot transition that brings them together is too good to be true, so you'll either applaud it or laugh yourself silly about it.Robbins misses more than he hits in ""Hardball"" as a director. He makes us aware of social consciousness issues, chiefly the precarious environment where the KeKambas live. Dope-pedaling, trigger-happy gangstas plague the housing project and prey on the kids. Residents huddle on the floor beneath window level for safety's sake. Nevertheless, he fares well with some scenes, especially when asthmatic Jefferson (Julian Griffith) tries to get home after dark and gangstas attack him. This is a pretty chilling scene. Meanwhile, just when Conor believes he is washed up, his luck abruptly changes for the better. Predictably, the KeKambas win the pennant, but not before sudden tragedy of the ""Pay It Forward"" variety exerts a terrible toll on them. This is the lowest and wildest pitch Robbins makes in an effort to win us over to this maudlin melodrama. Even if you hate ""Hardball,"" as I did, you'll find it difficult to exit with a dry eye.",Hardball
7,view_and_review,Hard Knocks,7,31 January 2021,"""Hardball"" is a sports movie where I was begging them to focus on the sports aspect of it.Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) was a degenerate gambler in the hole with a couple of different bookies. One bookie allowed him to make weekly payments in lieu of breaking his legs or worse. Out of desperation he went to his friend Jimmy (Michael McGlone) who was an investment banker or some such thing. Jimmy wouldn't give Conor the $12k he sought, but he brokered another deal with him: coach an inner city youth baseball team for $500/week. Beggars can't be choosers and Conor was well past begging.I was expecting a Chicago version of The Bad News Bears. Thankfully, it was not. The kids weren't bad players, and they weren't even a bad team, but they were a mess--arguing, fighting, and cussing. Conor's job would be to get them to act and behave like a team, but it was evident that they were bringing their neighborhood pathologies to the baseball field. But at least on the baseball field their antics weren't life threatening. Once we got off the field, for the coach and the players, things got dark. Conor was on the road to certain death with his bookies, and the kids, living in southside Chicago, could've been killed at any moment.This movie is far from Keanu's best, yet I think it was the finest acting job I've ever seen from him. I'm not saying he deserved an Oscar, but considering the very impassive performances I'm used to seeing--even in excellent movies--this was a welcome surprise. I actually saw something from him that could be defined as emotion.""Hardball"" was a hard-hitting movie as the title would suggest. Whether it was too hard and too ""real"" for this type of movie is debatable. There can be no doubt that kids in Chicago face what the kids in this movie faced and to pretend they don't is a disservice. But do we want to show that in a movie presumably about baseball? It was jarring, but I think it ultimately was the right decision. There are many many obstacles facing inner city children that prevent them from having a normal childhood and this movie highlighted just some of that. The movie was called ""Hardball"" afterall.",Hardball
8,Uriah43,"Has Elements of Comedy, Drama and Romance",6,26 September 2015,"""Conor O'Neill"" (Keanu Reeves) is a gambling addict who is suddenly finding himself in real financial trouble. It gets so bad that he is forced to go to a friend who works in the Chicago stock exchange and begs for $1200 in order to pay off some people it's best not to mess with. Quite unexpectedly, his friend makes him an unusual offer in which he will pay $500 a week if Conor agrees to help him coach a minor league team of black kids living in the projects. It's then that his friend decides to skip out and essentially leaves him all by himself. Although he is promised his money he realizes that in order to field a team he needs two more kids and they are being held back by a mean teacher at the school who refuses to let them play. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it attempted to combine several different cinematic elements into a fairly cohesive plot and succeeded to a certain extent. For example, it had elements of comedy, drama and romance but none of them seemed to overwhelm the other-at least for the most part. It also starred Diane Lane (as ""Elisabeth Wilkes"") who is always a welcome addition to any film. On the flip side, however, there were a couple of occasions when the acting just wasn't sufficient for the situation at hand which made the movie seem a bit uneven. Even so, I enjoyed the movie and as a result I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Hardball
9,anaconda-40658,Beat This Film With a Baseball Bat.,1,6 October 2015,"Hardball (2001): Dir: Brian Robbins / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Diane Lane, D.B. Sweeney, John Hawkes, Michael B. Jordan: 80, 000, 000th sports baseball movie about the hardened lives kids endure. It stars Keanu Reeves as a drunken gambler thrust into coaching an urban kids baseball team by a friend who will pay him $500 a week to do so. He figures that the money will pay off debts but he never factored in the behavior. This all leads to a happy ending for all save for the audience. Director Brian Robbins is responsible for Varsity Blues, as well as such crap as Good Burger and Ready to Rumble. He lets the material get away on him like a bunch of kids at an amusement park. It has no originality and characters say lines like, ""I'm blown away by your ability to show up."" I am blown away by his ability to say that with a straight face. Reeves makes little impression playing a role that has been done fifty times over. Diane Lane is basically a romantic prop for when Reeves has a free moment. Are we to be surprised when these two hook up? D.B. Sweeney plays Reeves's crime pal, although being in this film is perhaps his biggest crime. This is the kind of film that you line up and bat baseballs at just to see if one can smash a dent in it. It is one of the worst sports films ever made. Arguably about inner city kids seeking opportunity but the formula has been done so many times that it hits too many foul balls. Score: 1 / 10",Hardball
10,John6Daniels,"Strike one, caught you by surprise Strike two, right before your eyes Pitch three, this one's to the wall",10,20 March 2021,"One of the early movies that I seen in theaters as a little snot nosed punk.It was a good movie then and a great movie now. Sure its your typical race, saviour, sports movies but what can anyone do?It's about a coach down on his luck and he is given a chance to coach a baseball team. A baseball team in the Hood that is. At first he doesn't give a beavers damn then by the end John Wick becomes a champion because of Biggie Smallz.The acting from the youth were good. The story and pacing was great too.I have no complaints. It was a nice sports, hood movie. When the little guy died back then I almost lost it.What can be learned? Sammie was a good song and if you are from the hood just do good.Verdict: Grand slam.",Hardball
11,Floated2,Not original but it works at parts,6,18 July 2020,"There have been many sports dramas about underdog teams where a new coach unwantedly becomes the new coach and struggles at first then develops a bond with the team and eventually they see success. It is a common formula which has been done many times (prior to Hardball and after Hardball).Keanu Reeves plays his role convincingly enough as it is a character portrayal he has done several times.Although the story is predictable it does teach some lessons along the way. But at the same time some of the film feels forced and blending genres (family sports drama mixed with crime/mobster motives)Hardball does stand out for some its characters on the youth baseball team. Although at times relatively cheesy, it does offer an inspirational and certain motivational aspect which appears freely.",Hardball
12,philip_vanderveken,"Not original, but it works",7,22 June 2005,"I want to start by saying that this movie was actually a pleasant surprise. Knowing that this was a movie based on a true story, made with Keanu Reeves and a lot of kid-actors in it, I honestly feared the worst. But after watching it I must say that it really wasn't all that bad.Sure, the story is as predictable as you can get them in Hollywood. With a desperate white guy who is forced into coaching a children's sporting team from a rough black neighborhood, you already know perfectly what to expect and of course he will only keep doing his job because of a beautiful lady at first (the kids school teacher), but in the end he will learn the true value of these kids' will to win and to make something of their lives, so they can get out of the neighborhood. No the movie never gets far away from the stereotypes. But somehow it didn't bother me all that much for once.This is probably one of the best performances I've ever seen from Reeves (except for his roles in ""The Matrix"" and ""The Gift"") and despite the fact that this movie isn't a comedy, the dramatic story is relieved with some nice humorous touches. I don't know anything about baseball and normally I don't care about movies with baseball as the subject either, but for once I kept watching.As a conclusion I would like to say that if you are looking for an original movie, you better start looking somewhere else, but if you want to see a drama that exceeds the average Disney boundaries, you might want to give it a try. As I already said, I was pleasantly surprised by it and that's why I give this movie a 7/10.",Hardball
13,mattymatt4ever,"A familiar journey, nicely anchored by humor, charm and moving drama",7,22 September 2001,"I'm sure we've went down this road before.  Washed-up loser gets into a big mess; he/she becomes a coach of a pain-in-the-neck sports team.  ""Mighty Ducks"" and ""Sunset Park"" are two movies that come to mind.  Brian Robbins is obviously a big sports fan.  It seems as if his career focus is to make sports films.  Robbins also directed ""Varsity Blues"" and ""Ready To Rumble."" But I think ""Hardball"" has a much more raw atmosphere.  It's set in a cruddy inner-city in Chicago.  In the tradition of ""Bad News Bears"" the little tykes on the team possess amazingly filthy mouths.  I'm surprised this film actually earned the PG-13 rating (it was originally going to be an R).  Sure, the f-word is only mentioned once, but every other curse word in the book is mentioned almost repeatedly.  Some of the kids' foul language and slang is quite amusing and funny.  But at times it seems redundant and strictly for shock value. 
Keanu Reeves is terrific in a moderately different role.  He plays a gambling-addicted ticket scalper, who can never keep himself out of trouble. The opening scene is amusing.  Keanu enters a Church on a rainy night to pray that the Bulls cover the point spread.  Though I always felt Keanu was a talented actor (many seem to disagree), I have to hand it to him for taking on a role that requires him to be non-glamorous, unshaven and quite grungy.  And he's entirely convincing.  The beautiful Diane Lane plays a Catholic school teacher, who's concerned with the students from her class doing their book reports before going out on the field.  Her job is to pretty much serve as Keanu's female diversion.  Geez, I wonder if he gets her at the end.  Don't expect any big surprises; this is your standard sports comedy/drama. But it's funny, entertaining, well-acted and moving.  The film ends on a very depressing note, which had me crying my eyes out.  And of course, it delivers a wholesome message about sportsmanship--though it's obvious that Keanu would've had a much tougher time coaching the team if those were real ghetto kids.  But to every film, there has be an arc.  I'll let that slide. Besides, how can you pass on the chance to see Keanu sing ""Big Poppa"" by Notorious B.I.G.?  Talk about a chance of a lifetime! 
My score:  7 (out of 10)",Hardball
14,roedyg,Sugar with Saccharine Sprinkles,1,15 March 2008,"This is perhaps the most sickenly trite movie I have ever seen. It is entirely predictable. It is so sugary with ersatz emotion you need to shower afterward. It is beyond awful. The soaring violins accompanying trivial accomplishments ring false. There is not an original line in it. It deadly dull. The script could have been composed by a computer chopping up every sports movie ever made and mushing bits together at random. If movies were term papers, this one would the kind composed the night before it was due. I don't know what possessed an actor the calibre of Keanu Reeves to get involved. Perhaps they blackmailed him. Even the score was done on the cheap with a barely adequate rap group.",Hardball
15,LebowskiT1000,Good Film.,9,8 August 2002,"This film was not at all what I expected.  I thought the film was going to be a ""Mighty Ducks"" sort of movie, more comedy and less drama, and be more of a movie for kids.  But I can definitely say, after seeing the film, that this is NOT a movie for little kids!  This movie was made for adults.  The story contains a lot of adult topics not a whole lot of comedy (there is some comedy though).  The story is quite touching at times as well.I thought the actors did a great job in this film.  I don't care what anyone says, Keanu Reeves is a great actor!  I thought he did a great job in this film and really doesn't get the respect that he deserves.  Diane Lane did a great job as always and looks just a beautiful as ever.  The rest of the cast was good as well.I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, and certainly not to young children.  I'm not sure that children would like the film or even understand a lot of the issues in the film.  I would definitely recommend seeing this film to anyone that likes drama films about life in a big city.  I hope that you enjoy the film as much as I do.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Hardball
16,Spanner-2,"Familiar storyline, weak performance by Keanu",6,7 October 2001,"This drama has down on his luck compulsive gambler Keanu Reaves having to take over a rag tag inner city baseball team. Half inspirational inner city drama, half `Bad News Bears' remake. Though based on a true story, the terrain is familiar and Keanu seems to be sleepwalking through the assignment. GRADE: C",Hardball
17,CinematicInceptions,"Not incredible, but rather emotional and enjoyable.",7,27 December 2015,"Outside of the emotional ending, this movie isn't anything special, but I think it is a little underrated. On the surface, it's a sports movie and was advertised to be one, but there is actually not that much focus on the team as a baseball team. We only see about fifteen minutes of the team playing baseball in a couple of practices and maybe three games. The ""ship"" isn't even the climax of the movie and you don't even care that they win it, outside of that being expected by nature of the genre.Most of the story centers on Conor O'Neill, whose life is not in great shape. He's deep in debt with people who probably don't have a great source of income themselves and seems generally miserable. He takes a job coaching a U-10 baseball team and eventually warms up to the kids and by the end he appreciates their situation. The couple of scenes were we see life in the kids' neighborhood, and they seemed pretty accurate- maybe a little over done at a couple points, but you hear about gang violence in the news a lot so it's probably spot on and I just have no experience to judge it on. Basically, the story is about Conor and the team giving each other hope, and this is all but stated outright over the course of the movie, so you don't have to go hunting for the theme. There are two subplots, one involving Conor's gambling habits and the other with the kids' teacher Miss Wilkes.Conor is slightly reminiscent of Travis Bickle, though of course not as memorable, and is hardly what you'd call a model protagonist. Consequently, we have two foils for him: Miss Wilkes and Ticky. Miss Wilkes shows Conor's faults of not wanting to be as good a person as he can. Ticky represents Conor's former life of unsuccessful gambling and makes Conor's choice to break away from gambling a little more concrete. A couple of the players are examined more deeply to the extent that you'll probably know about half the players by name and have picked out a favorite by the end. There are a few minor antagonists in the guy from Smith and Stevens, the people Conor owes for his blown bets, and one of the opposing coaches coupled with the league administrators.The acting is pretty good for the most part, even from the ten kids. As expected, Keanu Reeves and Diane Lane give the best performances, but certainly not their best showings. The script is well paced and feels realistic, which is all it needs to be. There's nothing special in terms of directing outside of G-Baby's funeral at the end, which was really well done and is probably the most emotional scene in any movie I've watched.It's a very different role for Keanu Reeves, so don't expect him to have any action-hero moments like in the Matrix. There might be a few things that annoy you like the players trash talking each other or Miss Wilkes being shown as sort of a perfect character. Outside of that it should be mildly entertaining for any given viewer, so keep it on until you get bored with it. Overall Rating: 7.8/10",Hardball
18,The_Wood,how to turn endearing into shameful 4/10,4,25 February 2002,"Hardball makes for an interesting viewing.  At the beginning of the movie, it looks like it's going to live up to what it looks like: a common and uninvolved story of a white guy who is trying to teach black kids how to live better lives.  You know, your stereotypical Hollywood pompous crap.The movie has its own idea of comedy.  The young kids say obscene remarks to one another, and we're suppose to think it's cute.  Keanu Reeves, playing the fish out of water, makes it even funnier with his uproarious reactions to the children's manners -- oh how funny.  And of course, what would an inner city tale be without different types of rap music blaring every five minutes.As the movie gets going, it begins to surprise.  We realize that these gifted young actors, are ACTUALLY -- gifted young actors.  When they aren't reading stereotypical dialogue from the foolish script, they are able to create likable, in-depth characters, that are fun to watch.  The film does a nice job exploring why Keanu Reeves is coaching the team -- and while Diane Lane and D.B. Sweeney are barely used -- they do help the film become something more then your typical inner city youth saga. I liked these parts, which makes the film all the more disappointing.Unfortunately, the movie does end up going back to its shameful ways.  The last 10 minutes of the film are so typical, so obvious, that you'll want to puke.  Of course the movie has to kill off one of the kids -- this wouldn't be a show about black kids if they didn't.  And of course the movie has to spell out that Keanu wasn't really showing the kids how to play baseball, but how to live better lives.  Without his presence, one of the kids ends up joining a gang.The film is offensive to minorities more so then any Hollywood film of recent memory.  After watching Hardball, I wondered how hard it would be to make ""just"" a baseball movie -- instead of trying to make a film that's trying to change the world.  The message of this film: All minority kids are doomed unless you can play baseball.  Ignore your parents; ignore your teachers; make sure you have a white coach to save the day.  This is Patch Adams teaches baseball.  What a sour film.",Hardball

20,saarvardi,"Forgotten gem of a film, Hardball is an adorable little sports feature you won't want to miss",9,7 December 2007,"Now here's a little forgotten gem of a film that had the misfortune, or shall I say audacity, of being released on September 14th, 2001, only three days after the day the world changed forever.It is mostly this misfortune to blame for the fact that this adorable little sports film is mostly overlooked and unappreciated. It's a shame, though, as Keanu Reeves really shines as a lost soul who gets to coach a team of Little League baseball players by mere chance. Dealing with mostly African American kids from the projects of Chicago is never an easy thing to do, but through some clichés and many true moments of genius, Reeves's character manages to find himself again.

22,srmccarthy,"Great re-make of ""Comeback Kid""",7,24 March 2002,"I see many people refer to ""Bad News Bears"", but that is well out of date concerning the real inspiration for this movie.  This is an obvious re-make of the 1990 movie ""The Comeback Kid"".  I had nothing but contempt for The Comeback Kid, as it left me high and dry, but this movie brought the true meaning and expression to life for me!     Do not be fooled into believing that this is a rap infested torture that has nothing you would regard as touching, because it is far from that! It is more than a monument to the original (C.B.K.), it is an instruction! The story is about a man, overwhelmed in debt (brought about by gambling) , given a chance to change his lifestyle by making a difference to a bunch of un-wanted city children.  You might not believe it when you begin watching this, but unless you are anti-sentiment, this movie will bring tears to your eyes (both of sorrow and joy)!COMEBACK KID vs HARDBALL:SPOILER!!!!    Although both of these movies had a tragic situation that brought about the positive outcome, Hardball won my acceptance because it explained the reason for the positive outcome!  Face it, in Comeback Kid, it was never made clear why the boy was inspired to join the team of boys, but Hardball makes it very clear!",Hardball
23,jimakros,i liked it a lot,6,25 July 2005,"I liked this movie.Yes,its about a baseball little league,yes it has the usual ""lets be a team and win"" attitude,but its very well acted by these kids and the dialog sounds real,also its not concentrated only on the kids.Its more like what the kids get to mean to this guy,who is sort of a loser,and doesn't actually care much about baseball or anything else.I thought it was well acted,surprisingly good for Keanu Reeves who is not one of my favorite actors,but he seems inspired in this movie. I thought it was very well directed and the whole ghetto setting seems disturbingly realistic.It passes its social message in a simple,direct way without preaching.I recommend it to anyone who is interested in a low key likable movie.",Hardball
24,guyb,Strike out in the last innings,1,5 July 2002,"This movie seemed like just another Bad News Bears wannabe.  But, based on the IMDB reviews, I gave it a try.  It started out pretty good.  Keanu was pretty intense and believable.   The character development of the kids was good to.  But, once the baseball started it was pretty poor and jumped around alot.  Finally, it just fell apart at the end.  After the arch enemy coach called them on several illegalities,  he just lets the kid in the game to win.  Go figure.",Hardball

26,LeThAlWeApOn389,Great Movie (BIG SPOILER),9,11 July 2003,"This movie was fantastic. I think the plot of the movie was very touching and greatly written. Keanu Reeves was perfect for the part. This was a completely different plot from the Matrix, my favorite film of him, and I wonder if it was difficult for him to change that sort of role very quickly. But I thought he did a great job. I thought the kids in the movie did great too. They were funny and had a lot of motivation in winning the championship. I was really upset that kid died at the end. I thought that shouldn't have happened because that takes the spirit away from the film. Everyone was having fun, they were finally winning and the end just stopped all the excitement. The movie was fantastic just the same. I give this movie ***1/2 and I recommend this movie to all Keanu Reeves fans and all the people who like tense a great acting. TWO THUMBS UP!!!!!",Hardball
27,paul-nemecek,Hardball Goes Down Swinging,5,3 July 2018,"Hardball is a well-intentioned, tender-hearted film that gets lost in clichés, stereotypes, and bad writing. Keanu Reeves plays Coner O'Neal, a heavy-drinking compulsive gambler who is clearly down on his luck. When he asks a stockbroker-friend to loan him some money, his friend instead offers him a job-coaching Little League ball players for $500 a week. The catch is that this particular Little League team is made up of residents from Cabrini-Green, Chicago's most notorious public housing project.So, we end up with the white mentor meets black street kid cliché (Finding Forrester). The basic plot line of the film is the standard sports film cliché. For me, almost all sports films are variations of Rocky. For example, Hoosiers is ""rural Rockies play basketball"". The Mighty Ducks could be subtitled ""little Rockies play hockey"". Even Cool Runnings is ""Jamaican Rockies go bob-sledding"". The closest parallel is probably Bad News Bears, but Mighty Ducks is a close second.As is the case in many of these films, the basic formula is loser coach coaches loser athletes and they all become winners in the end. A common subplot occurs when the down-and-out coach loses faith in himself, but is propped up by the love of a good woman (""Yo' Adrian""). As I have stated before formula can be okay, if you create richly drawn characters and interesting contexts with unusual plot twists that keep us in suspense. Alas, Hardball had none of this.This is essentially a formula film with poorly developed characters, few innovations, and flat interpersonal relationships throughout the film. If you are interested in the film because you like sports films, see any of the other films listed above on video instead. Major League II even looks good by comparison. If your primary interest is in the lives of low-income minorities in the inner city check out the documentary Hoop Dreams, Menace II Society, Boyz in the Hood, or Clockers. If the interracial mentoring is what appeals, Finding Forrester is a much better choice. If you were interested in this film because you are a Keanu Reeves fan, see your therapist or wait for Matrix II.To be fair, there was one moment at the end of the film that was poignant, well-acted, and moving. This is a clear case of too little too late though. The film ended by swinging for the fences, but in the final analysis Hardball went down swinging.",Hardball
28,Abby-9,Hope is always the better choice,9,17 September 2001,"This is a stressful movie, with the gambling addiction and the gambling machine on one hand, and street gangs on the other.  I really like the kids and think Keanu Reeves plays it straight with them.  New York Times and local reviewers aside--way aside, this movie is definitely worth a look.  I spent eight years on Chicago's South Side, and i'm grateful a cinema team is willing to show some emotion about some of the stuff that is part of grim daily life.  The plot formula is good:  i don't like cold voyeuristic slice-of-life with this material.  I like that the material is used with an up-beat ending.  Let us enjoy the entertainment of it, and find some hope in it.   Goethe said that hope is always the better choice.  And i will say it here:  Keanu Reeves can act.",Hardball

30,DrewAlexanderR1,Reality and Entertainment,8,5 September 2015,"Hard Ball is a slice of life film about an aimless young man given the opportunity to make a difference in the life of ten young boys from the projects of Chicago. Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is an addict to gambling and this weakness lands him in a spot of trouble where he has to pay off two bookies and needs money fast. He reaches out to an old friend, who's in business, for cash and agrees to coach a little league team for the money. The film goes on to tell the story of O'Neill and the boys as they change each others perspectives and end up helping each other become better people. John Gatins (Coach Carter, Flight) begins his writing career with this as his second feature film. It is a straight forwards predictable story but it has a special quality about it. The film stays away from making things bigger than they are and opts for a realistic outlook on the lives of the characters involved. Keanu Reeves gives a performance that not many would attribute to his successful career, but is a performance that shouldn't be overlooked. Michael B. Jordan (Chronicle, Fruitvale Station) is a one of the kids and gives a performance that foreshadows his career to come.Hard Ball, while not an Oscar worthy film, is one that will lift you up without asking for the suspension of belief. You don't need to put aside unrealistic happenings in the film because it doesn't try to be something its not. This film is there to give you insight into a story that you don't see everyday. It leans towards reality rather than entertainment and achieves both.",Hardball
31,kenyaekofi,Boo,2,23 April 2021,"This movie sucked. First let me say why Keanu Reeves why?! I hate white savior movies. This movie was stereotypical and corny. This movie didn't make any clear point. Helping black kids learn how to play baseball was just a stupid concept. I hate the fact that Michael B Jordan said yes to this movie. This movie also can do without Keanu Reeves trying to sing a Biggie Smalls song. Connor made a dynamic and good relationship with kids overnight and his relationship with the teacher happened so fast and basically overnight. In this movie the kids learned how to play baseball after three scrimmages or practices. This movie was definitely wild to watch and not in the good way. I knew that Keanu Reeves and the students were going to sing Big Poppa to Miles when he had to pitch without music. When Gerry died I was so upset because the movie just made a left turn. Black kids, I am certain don't curse as much as the movie made them curse. I saw this movie needed a chill pill and that it got protested for the black children cursing and acting all wild. This movie sucked and I hated this white savior movie. Two out of ten for me.",Hardball
32,Darguz,Wow.,9,26 October 2003,"It never ceases to amaze me how people can have such widely differing *strong* reactions to a film. A number of negative reviews here, but let me add one more positive.I loved this film, from beginning to end. I loved every aspect of it: the story, the acting, the plot. I expected just another ""Coach takes over losing team and makes them winners"" story. Those are fine stories now and then, and I was not expecting anything more than mild entertainment. But this film moved me. Now, I'm a middle-aged white boy, and while I've never been rich I've never gone hungry either, and I've never had to worry about getting shot on the way home, so maybe I don't really know what that ""sh*t"" is all about and maybe this film wasn't ""realistic"" in portraying all that; but it communicated to me, and that's what any film is all about. And sometimes in order to communicate, you have to go half way between where you are and where the other person is, and maybe that's what this film did. But whatever, I got it.",Hardball

'HARDBALL' really has everything going for it - adorable kids who are very funny and sweet (with the occassional foul language), KEANU REEVES who is just right for this role, and the ever reliable DIANE LANE who proves once again that even with limited screen time she IS a star. The supporting actors are good and the ghetto scenes realistic. The baseball sequences were superbly done and the films sad, happy, sad, happy rollercoaster ride was superbly executed. The final uplifting end of the movie is just what we need. HARDBALL with KEANU REEVES and DIANE LANE is a home run! DIANE LANE also stars in THE GLASS HOUSE released this same week.",Hardball

I bought the DVD and watched it only because of baseball, but at that time I did not have any clue about what this film was trying to say. I watched this movie again last night (after 11 years), and I must admit that the tears were rolling down the cheeks when the film was finished.The film has a simple story about a gambler who tries to figure out what he can do for living. After getting an offer from an old friend, his life which was like a roller-coaster turns out to be a quiet wave. This film makes a man to look at everybody's life before he decides if his life is perfect or not. Reeves meets eight young individuals who change his life and learns that life has several other values than money.Keanu Reeves, who is best known for his role as Neo in The Matrix trilogy, has done a great job as usual and has given life throughout the film. His performance in the climax makes the audience to get in tears. Diane Lane, who plays Reeves's love interest and the kids played by Bryan C. Hearne, Julian Griffith, Michael Jordan, A. Delon Ellis Jr., Kristopher Lofter, Michael Perkins, Brian M. Reed and DeWayne Warren have all delivered a mind-blowing performance.This film might be a message to those who are out there on the edge for give up.

My oh my, the horror, the horror! Words cannot express how extremely bad this film is. Here, I only want to highlight two things: (i) A gorgeous, white, single female teacher in a ghetto. I almost fell off my chair when they brought this on. And why are these gorgeous women always single. You will never hear:MAN (e.g., Keanu Reeves): Er, hi, I'm Pete. Er, uhm, are you single?PRETTY WOMAN: Why do you want to know?MAN: Well, er, I would like to ask you to go out with me tonight.WOMAN: I can do without that. I already have a boyfriend.

It is heart warming tin showing the ability to show up no matter your circumstances. Keanu plays a lost person with no purpose in life but gambling and drinking.

43,lgoodman,Not a good film,4,2 April 2004,"At first, I expected this to be another Mighty Ducks-type of movie, with heartwarming interaction between a messed-up guy and a lovable group of kids who teach him about teamwork and the love of the game.  But no.  In Hardball, Keanu Reeves started out grumpy, and he stayed grumpy.  The kids, despite the trauma in their lives that could be pretty sympathetic, weren't lovable, and you didn't feel like you got to know them on any kind of personal level.  If Keanu's character had grown, if his coaching had seemed to mean anything to the kids or if you could in any way understand Diane Lane's contention that the kids trusted him and they're never wrong, then this movie might have been okay.  As it is, however the story was bad, and the weak acting only added to that to make this movie less than enjoyable.I'm a huge baseball fan, but even so, I'd say skip this and go rent The Mighty Ducks.  Or, if you want to stick to the baseball storyline and you aren't so hung up on the 'down-on-his-luck curmudgeonly coach with a team of spunky kids' plot, then Little Big League or Rookie of the Year are both fun family films with cute kids and good baseball.  All of these movies are far superior to Hardball.Four stars out of ten",Hardball

Sure, I could predict when certain elements would happen. But it didn't matter.  It had enough surprises, and enough twists to keep me engrossed.  And it sure had plenty of heart. It had a sense of humor, blended with suspense and drama.  Rather ""gritty"", but that is part of why it is a bit unique, and more effective. Keanu Reeves does just fine in this role.  He really can pull off the hopeless loser.  He's quite good. Diane Lane is also great, and just lovely. The kids are wonderful - all of them. I wasn't all that enchanted with the kids' foul language, but it fits in with the context of the plot. If you are looking for a ""feel good"" movie that has a little more depth (and not quite so many clichés that other ""formula"" movies might) then this film is the one to watch.  A true delight.

50,johnhenrik,"Entertaining, even if it is total FANTASY!",5,14 April 2007,"How many bookies are out there who will take a word of mouth bet from somebody who owes? For that matter, how many gambling idiots have thugs after them?--we will beat you up an kill you if you don't pay us now-- This movie is entertaining and does touch on some important subjects, but the clichés just don't stop. Innocent people die frequently in lower income neighborhoods from stray bullets that are from gang activity. It would have made some sense for us to see more police in the movie. But I guess that would take away from the plot. Plot?....A loser white guy is called on to help the inner-city black kids in South Chicago's projects? I guess Hollywood believes there's incredible funding for the children in America's ghettos. OK Reeves, get to work dude, like, these kids in da hood are like, counting on you. Now Ms Lane is still insanely pretty, but her placement in the movie is hard to believe. That's not to say that there are no white people working with black kids in the inner-city, but think about it. I've worked in an inner-city school in California and just helping the kids during the school day was a challenge. For outside of school activities, ridiculous amounts of preparation had to be worked on. Now, maybe Chicago doesn't have as many communication problems that California does with non-English speaking parents, but just being able to talk with parents who speak English takes time and often doesn't go well. Try getting the older daughter, with a mother who works three jobs, to set up a time, for the teacher, or coach in this case, to talk with the mother about her 11 year old son's need to start paying attention. This movie doesn't even go near subjects like that. I not too put off by Keanu's acting ability in this movie, though I still think he's a one-trick pony, and there were no tricks in this script for him to do. He still seems likable. But, a white guy who's a ticket scalping, gambling loser coaching a little league team of poor black kids in the projects....??? I guess Hollywood still thinks that the lives of poor black kids in the inner-cities can only be improved with help from caring white people (even if these are white people with shady backgrounds). There's no need to mention that just shopping for food in the low-income communities is sometimes impossible. Maybe an already made sandwich from the corner liquor store will satisfy the kids hunger, but the city bus line to that one suburban-like big grocery store in the neighborhood one and a half miles away has been canceled and Mama's going to have to figure out another way to get some real food that's affordable. I'm sorry, but although the movie hits some subjects that need to be discussed in our society, the script needs some major work. Why can't these ultra-rich studio executives consider getting input from the social workers in the inner-city, some active residents, teachers, youths, some freshly out of jail young men who are working on cleaning themselves up, etc. Sickeningly rich movie producers just have no idea what the real world is like for most working people. But, this movie is still fun to watch when I've got nothing else to do.",Hardball

53,Slutmagic2021,Great,8,29 March 2008,"Keanu Reeves has taken a lot....and I do mean A lot of doo-doo (imdb has dumb censorship rules so I can't say a certain word that rhymes with bit) for his acting. And with his performance in Jonny Mnemonic I can see why but I think people often forget that, when given the right role, he can be great. Speed, A Scanner Darkly and of course The Matrix are prime examples of how Keanu can really be a great actor. And with out a doubt, Harball proves this once again.The story of Hardball sounds like a generic sports movie and listening to the plot on paper makes it sound like Mighty Ducks with baseball. However, while the story may not be the most original thing, the approach is what makes Hardball stand out. Instead of taking the easy way out by making it a family comedy where the team comes together to win with their ""used to be a douche-bag coach"", Hardball is a surprisingly powerful drama. Keanu is very good as a gambler who excepts a job coaching inner-city kids on a baseball team to help pay a debt he owes. Along the way he realizes he is kind of an A-hole and not really going anywhere but down and really starts to enjoy the kids. The movie takes itself pretty seriously which works really well. Diane Lane is the obligatory love interest and does a great job as always. All of the kids on the Baseball team turn in great performances as well but it is really Keanu that steals the show. He really shines in a speech he gives near the end at a funeral and wow....I never cry during a movie....and still have not....but I was pretty close during that scene. How he didn't get at least nominated for an Oscar for that is further proof that the people who choose the nominations are idiots.So overall....a well done Drama with a great performance by Reeves and all involved.

Cynics will scoff at the story of an impoverished kids baseball team from the wrong side of the tracks overcoming adversity to win a trophy, thanks in part to the efforts of  a reformed gambler and drunkard Conor O'Neill (Reeves), but if only life was like this occasionally ! Maybe it is ?  Diane Lane was, as ever, quite luminous and the way her acting has shone in recent years is,for me,one of the highlights of going to the movies. The role of schoolteacher Elizabeth Wilkes is only a supporting one here,but she exudes real presence every time she comes on screen. I'm not a great fan of Keanu Reeves but he is very believable in Hardball and all the kids were excellent too. Yes it is an idealistic, sentimental and corny movie but I loved it and Reeves' address in the church was genuinely moving. Just as his character was "" uplifted just for a moment "" by one of his team so I was for the duration of this movie and for some time after. Nice soundtrack too.",Hardball
57,wginc1,Such a heartwarming Film!,10,15 September 2001,"Got a chance to see ""Hardball"" here in Baltimore last night, and I mustsay I certainly am glad that I did!  I just needed something to give me a small boost and leave reality behind for just a spell and this cute little film certainly did just that!  D.B Sweeney was just so sweet and lovable as he always has been, but the young lady opposite of Keanu Reeves I am unfamiliar with. Me thinks her name is Diane Lane.  She was just the ticket next to Keanu Reeves. All others in the film were wonderful also, but the kids were truly my treat.  They were just what the doctor ordered(smile). I have never seen Keanu in a film opposite so many young folks, but to my delight he was truly great with them.  They generated a warm heat that just melted you inside.  He is wonderful with kids I must say and they just seem to like him too! I hope to see him again in more films with kids because he is awesome.  Go and See this film.  I truly related to this film in more ways than one and it was sweet! Kudos to Keanu and the rest of his cast and crew.  ""Good Filming,Wonderful Movie!""Peace Sandy",Hardball
58,veracious_lies,"No Mighty sucks, with a touch of ghetto life.",8,17 June 2003,"The best thing about this movie is that it truly doesn't focus on baseball, even though the title might suggest that. It's a movie about life, not baseball. I think the movie's title represents the movie well, but is still very misleading and sounds silly. ""Ball"" because there is the baseball element, ""hard"", because that's how life is for the main character, gambling addict, and the kids in the team.Overall, I liked this movie. When I first saw the title & read the plot summary, I thought it was going to suck majorly, but I thought I'd watch it because it was a Keanu Reeves-movie and I like any film with him at least a little, because he's a pleasure to watch on screen. Then I read some of the user comments here & was pleasantly surprised. When I watched the film, I was even more surprised of the humor in it, the sense of rough reality. It most certainly wasn't a fun kids' film like Mighty Ducks... A lot more cursing, a lot more violence. Don't get me wrong, the violence wasn't THAT bad. There was only like 2 scenes of it.I really liked the drama in this movie. I like Keanu Reeves' character. His life is a complete mess with all his debts & associations with bookies. Naturally, with the story, he evolves, changes. Keanu Reeves did a good job. He doesn't usually get to act much, because I guess the directors a. Don't find him a good actor or/and b. Only want him to look pretty on-screen. This has got to be my favorite movie with him so far alongside the first Matrix. Absolutely. He gets to act, he does a good job at it. A good break for Keanu.The kids were great actors & very funny. I liked their input a lot on this movie. None of them really stood out, but as a group they worked well and did a good job on the film.Then onto the parts that weren't all that.. great. First of all, it's really disturbing to hear Keanu Reeves sing Notorious B.I.G's ""Big Poppa"". Now matter how drunk his character is, he just shouldn't sing that. Second of all, the love affair between Connor [Keanu's character] and Diane Lane's character, Elizabeth, seemed a little forced. It brought some pretty funny moments to the movie & Diane Lane was a good, emotional actress, as usual, but it didn't give the story much & didn't seem very essential. Her character was necessary, but the romance seemed slightly forced.If you get to watch it on DVD, watch the deleted scenes as well. Some pretty nice scenes there.All in all, in my pretty loose rating scale [I could give lots of movies 9, very little movies a 1], I'd rate this one 7+/10. Or perhaps even an 8. Watch it if you want to see a decent drama film. Watch it if you want to see some really tragic things happening in the ghetto. Watch it if you want to see Keanu Reeves really act for once.",Hardball
59,keanuette,A Great Movie ~ 5 Stars!!,10,5 March 2002,"Wow. Keanu Reeves only gets better and better. He gives another great performance as the messed up gambling low life, Conor O'Neill who finds redemption in training a little league baseball team from the projects.Hardball hits you in all the right places. It's got heart, it's got a great storyline and a great ensemble cast. I was very moved by the performance of the young team of baseball players. You could really feel their struggle to get away from their poverty stricken lives by escaping to play baseball and triumphing against the odds. This is a feel-good movie. It lets you know there are people out there who care for others welfare and will do all they can to help, which was very evident.I just wished it had a slightly longer running time, in order to explore the relationship between Conor and Miss Wilkes [played by Diane Lane].
It has a great soundtrack, which I recommend you buy",Hardball
60,synefra,Not a revelation but worth seeing,7,9 October 2001,"I didn't really want to see Hardball, I went in with low expectations. So I was almost surprised when staring at the 'rate this movie' screen I gave it 7/10, but let me tell you why (and trust me I thought about it for a few long moments deciding what to give it and why). First the downside: the story was predictable in every way, it was almost painful for me to see children so young using such language and being abused in so many ways, but it was realistic. The high rating I gave it was because the young actors were so very talented, and while the story was obvious it still managed to make me care what happened and what was happening. I wasn't engrossed, I didn't sob like a baby, I didn't find it a revelation on life and death. However, it was very much what it purported to be, a story about showing up. And it did have an interesting message about how something, that to one person can be so insignificant, can be so profound and life-changing to others. Keanu Reeves gets a lot of bad press about being a 'bad actor' but I found him very believable and thought he did an extremely good job. He has a lot of charisma and an amazing ability to make you care about his characters, and want, in the end, the best for them.",Hardball
61,tank69-2,change the name to Lame Ball,2,25 January 2003,Keanu what were you thinking. You had the nerve to turn down Speed 2 and not pass up this piece of garbage? I'm also ashamed for Diane Lane. Was it simply for the paycheck honey? I would watch Corky Romano 4 more times than sit through this load of a movie. Terrible acting punctuates this horror. This movie is as phony as all of those Chicken Soup for the Soul books. Good kids movie or for delusional adults that believe in fairy tales.,Hardball
62,wrygrass,"A little miracle of a movie: moving, realistic anduplifting",10,9 September 2001,"This film portrays the life of a group of boys who play one summer on a baseball league organized in the projects in Chicago. With out flinching an iota in portraying the material decay and the real fear of violence that permeates its setting, the film still shows the beauty of life--the importance of ""just showing up"" and trying. The young, unknown boys give outstanding performances which are matched by a moving performance by Keanu Reeves. Reeves, in his most emotive performance to-date, plays the team's coach who is redeemed by his contact with the kids, by simply learning to care about someone besides himself. Definitely NOT the ""Bad News Bears,"" but a great movie experience for everyone--sports lovers or not.",Hardball
63,edbeas-2,Not a Reeves fun but a good flick,8,14 September 2001,I had to be dragged to the Matrix because Reeves was in that film. I went to see Hardball because I heard it was a feel-good flick and I needed that right now.  One of the more entertaining movies I have seen this year. They are some sad spots and if are exposing life in the getto that is going to happen.  I enjoy this movie.,Hardball
64,alexparedesvera,This movie should have better ratings,7,17 February 2002,"This movie is one that has a little bit of everything. It has comedy scenes as well as drama scenes. Maybe, Keanu is not a great actor but his performance is not so bad at all. I think that people were a little hard with their opinions. If people want to have a good time of fun and entertainment, I recommend this movie.",Hardball
65,dhalpert,Not very good!,3,6 October 2002,"Disappointing!  I managed to get through the movie without turning it off. I thought the acting was poor, the story okay, but not well executed, the editing very bad.  Predictable and boring - cute kids could not save this movie.",Hardball
66,wax55,Really hard pressed to say anything Keanu.,7,29 September 2001,"Hardball is a totally predictable film from start to finish.  While the young boys gave excellent efforts in their roles and Keanu was his usual outstanding self, the story line has been over done.  This film was entertaining and I enjoyed the efforts by all the actors but it is not the type of film Reeves has done so well in the past.  This appears to be just a film for families with time on their hands on a Sunday afternoon.  I rated it a six out of ten and recommend it for viewing teenage and up.",Hardball
67,Kenard_joy,Hard Ball,10,29 October 2014,"I will always give this movie a 10 out of 10, because of the planning, and plot of the movie! Hard Ball is a great movie, the movie shows how real life is for some blacks, it also shows sportsmanship and how to help a team when. Hard Ball focused on a baseball team with very little skill, until a coach, has to coach the team for a period of time to get the some money! Before coach leaves his team he relieves that it was more than a team all along! Once he's comfortable he helps this team! Knowing he still has his own personal problems. A dramatic change in the movie was G-Baby. I won't go into detail but that is a major turning point in the movie. After the G-baby thing, the team goes on to play in the championship, and for the outcome, you'll have to watch the movie! Overall the actors, the plot, and shots in the movie were great! The story line is just a 10 out of 10 that's why i rate this movie 10 out of 10 every time!",Hardball
68,penn st.,One of the best films I have ever seen.,9,17 March 2002,"Hardball is a film that will make you laugh the shed a tear all in the same scene.  In other words, great. The young actors are superb and Reeves really shines.  I was hooked the first five minutes. To tell the truth I thought it was going to be a ""Bad news bears"" remake.  I was so wrong.  this picture has everything a true movie buff wants in a film.  I highly recommend this picture.",Hardball
69,stevie_y96,Best Ever,10,28 April 2002,Hardball by far has to be the best movie ever made.  It combines the spirit of team work with the real truth of what it is like to live in the poverty level parts of big cities.  It shows the true meaning of life; survival. Hardball brings out all kinds of emotions from the viewers.  Only the truly great movies do that.  This movie is a must see for all sports fans and especially those that are not.  Hardball shows the world how great sports are and how meaningful they can be.,Hardball
70,AlexInChains19,"""One of the most important things in life is showing up.""",7,4 April 2009,"This is the story about Connor O'Neal(Keanu Reeves), a guy with a big gambling debt. He makes his living by scalping tickets and then making bets. In order to pay off his debts, he goes to an old friend who works at a big broker firm. Instead of giving Connor money, he gives him a job coaching a bunch of troubled kids in a rundown Chicago neighborhood. He is very resentful and judgemental at first, but he becomes very attached to the kids. He becomes somewhat of a father figure for many of the kids since, as Kofi says, ""Where I come from, don't nobody's father ever come back."" Anyway, despite several tragic events, the boys go on to play in ""the ship."" I enjoy movies that invoke a certain emotional feeling inside one's heart. This movie definitely produces those feelings.",Hardball

I feel like it's one of those movies where you discovert something knew every time you see the movie.  This action movie made me want to burst into tears.  The tear-jerker gave the movie a new meaning which I found interesting.  The went over and beyond on the swears.  I would've changed that and the beginning which wasn't the best beginning, actually quite boring.",Hardball
72,doctorben,"An average movie, nothing spectacular.",5,22 September 2001,"Hardball is about a group of boys from the Chicago projects who play on what we must assume is the worst team in Little League.  Until, of course, down and out Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is cornered into coaching the team in return for a loan from a friend to pay off his gambling debts. Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane Lane), the boys' teacher, is also along for part of the ride.I apologize up front for the lazy synopsis I just gave but for a movie as generic and average as this I just couldn't spend the brain energy on making it anymore exciting than that.  Now don't get me wrong this wasn't really a bad movie, it just wasn't a really good movie either.  This movie seems to have a hard time figuring out what it is about.  Is it about Conor's gambling problem and his attempts to not get killed for his bad debts?  Or is it about a Little League team and a coach who learn to care for each other and rely on each other?  Or is it about Conor and Elizabeth and their relationship?  If you picked any of these answers you are wrong. It's about none of them.  Oh it dabbles in all of them but doesn't really take any of them far enough to say it is actually about them.  The movie seems to dip in and out of the different story lines without really advancing them or resolving anything.  Take the boys and the little league team for example.  They start of as the worst team on the league.  By game two they are kicking butts and taking numbers.  When did they learn all these skills.  Were they just pretending to be so bad to lure the other teams into a false sense of security?  We don't get to see Conor (Keanu) really doing any coaching or forming any bonds with the boys on the team, yet we are supposed to believe that these things happened.  One boy finds out he can't play for the team because of his age and runs off to join a gang.  What happens to him, not important apparently and Conor seems like he doesn't care either.  And the gambling thing?  Resolved halfway through and it just goes away.  We don't see him making any of these amends, we are supposed to accept that it has happened.  Plot holes galore, things not resolved, blech!  Lazy writing I say.  Now the story wasn't all bad, it was redeemed a little by the last 10 minutes, but it wasn't enough to pull this out of the average category.Now lets talk a little about the actors.  I like Keanu Reeves, really I do.  It's just that he needs very specific roles.  If you need someone to look lost and confused and not much else, Keanu is your man.  I though he was perfect for The Matrix.  Really though people, as much as some of you Keanu fans want to believe it, the man can't act.  That's all there is to it.  It's not like he's reading his lines off a queue card or anything like some 'actors' (i.e. pretty boy Justin Chambers of The Musketeer) he's just a little robotic.  It's not a good show of your acting chops when you are outdone by a group of 10 year olds.  I thought all the kids in this movie were pretty good, they were likable and they had me laughing (in the good way) a few times.Overall this movie was not horrible and if you are deciding between this and The Musketeer (now there was a real crapper but you can go read my review for that and find out what I really thought), Hardball should win hands down.  It's just that there are some better movies out there right now you should be putting your money down to see.",Hardball
73,ymcdowell18,Don't Be Fooled. *Slight Spoiler*,7,25 September 2001,"I actually enjoyed ""Hardball.""  Keanu Reeves actually proves to be ""okay"" in this film.  The kids on the team are, of course, adorable.  Most have never acted, but somehow that is exactly what makes the film work.  Brian Robbins proves to be a capable director.  However, don't walk into the theater thinking that Hardball is a cute ""kid-friendly"" film.  It isn't.  The language is definitely not meant for anyone under 8.  There are also parts in the film that prove to be pretty heartbreaking.  The film is a good way to spend a couple of hours if you have nothing better to do.  You will walk out and not feel like you just wasted 6 bucks.  It's not exactly realistic, but that's part of why I liked it.  It's a nice escape from the reality that is going on around us.",Hardball
74,graphixauthority,Kids May Gain From Seeing This Movie?,8,29 June 2003,"When I first saw this movie, I watched it with my daughter who was 10 years old at the time.  The language was kind of edgy but not too serious.  I'm sure she hears worst from her friends at school (even though we try to ignore those facts). This flick had it all. From the coach struggling with his own morality, vices and (of course) romance, to the kids plagued by the daily atrocities of their neighborhood.  Through these tribulations, however, we learn that ""showing up"" (coined from the movie) was the best way to face and overcome our problems.  This applies to all of us across the board.
I read a few reviews that discouraged kids from seeing this movie and I wholeheartedly disagree.  Why can we let our kids watch The Bad News Bears and The Mighty Ducks but discard a movie that gives us a taste of the reality of our inner city youth whom want to play ""Hardball""?  Yes they spoke more freely with there swearing than a kid from the burbs. But isn't that the point? They're not from the burbs.  Yes there was a shooting scene but you didn't actually see the shot hit.  But it's ok for our kids to see the Matrix where people are getting shot left and right. sheez.  I hope that one day America can stop hiding the inner city from their kids and let them know how their less fortunate counterparts living (and dying).  Maybe they will take less for granted and appreciate their situation more after seeing this flick.  Maybe they will want to help solve some of the problems when they get older except ignoring them like their parents are doing because their parents sheltered them from the same things in the 70's & 80's.  I'm not trying to sell this movie by saying it's going to change any social order or make your kid a better person.  What I'm saying is... Let them watch it, talk about it and ""YOU"" will make your kid a better person through your dialogue and time.  This movie is just to supplement your efforts.",Hardball
75,danieljbarton,deserving of the 'Ship',7,11 May 2015,"This film moved me the first time I watched it years ago and after watching again the same aspects got me, specifically the scene with Jefferson making the trip home alone. You can critique the message, realism and accuracy with this film all you want but it takes a cold hearted person to not get emotional watching that boy scared, struggling for breath! The timing was perfect, acting from the kids was gritty and thankfully avoided coming across as 'too scripted' with great support from Keanu, I say support as for me the kids stole the show.This film scores higher than similar titles such as 'Coach Carter' as the young actors do a great job of sucking the viewer in while you believe the down on his luck, addictive portrayal from Keanu.If you're taking the time to read this review typed up at 2.16am then you might want to check out 'Radio' and 'Remember the Titans' for similar films.",Hardball

It was also very unclear about some parts.It begins with Keanu Reeves's character, Conor, being beat up by this guy who he obviously owes money too. Why he owes money is a tad confusing until a couple minutes later when you find out that Conor is a gambler in serious debt. Conor then goes to a friend of his (It's unclear as to what his friend does for a living. I think he's an accountant or a banker. Like I said, it's unclear.) to borrow $12,000 so that he can get out of his debt. His friend says he can't do that, but he will pay him $500 a week if he coaches a baseball team of young boys.Basically, Conor teaches the boys how to become a winning team.

I'm glad that I'm his fan and it gives me chance to see this kind of movie. Moreover, the black kid in the film also impressed me very much. They have different names different characters different habits but they are all very cute and struggling. They live in a hard environment but never give up. The baseball time is their only happy time. And it's them who changed Keanu Reeves. They saved his life. He saved theirs. Even one of them lost his life.

80,oprjsd,A Masterpiece!,10,18 December 2002,"I loved this film! Probably a lot of people disagree with me, but I feel that this is the best film of all time. Even though, after seeing ""Hardball"" many times it may have lost some touch, I have not forgotten the effect it had on me the first time I saw it.In ""Hardball"" Keanu Reeves plays a gambler who is offered to get paid under the table by a friend, if he coaches a Little League baseball team for children in the Cabrini Green Housing Projects. Really, I feel that this film is no more about gambling than it is about baseball, even though there's a lot of baseball. I feel that this film is really about one man's conversion brought on by the children he coaches. He touches their lives and they touch his. Keanu Reeves is also touched with a light, chaste romance with Diane Lane as a school teacher of some of the team's boys.Some people may have felt that this film is predictable or formulaic, but I felt everything flowed so beautifully that it seemed real and felt great. As a matter of fact, I feel that ""Hardball"" doesn't fall prey to certain cliches.The acting is great, the music is electrifying, the cinematography very good, humor is there, and ""Hardball"" is ultimately uplifting and moving. It was so good, that it made me want to be a better person. No doubt I own the DVD and VHS. Not many movies I can say that for.",Hardball

If you have a soft heart, you will feel emotions, if your very young, you might only see it for the entertainment without ""entertainment value"".Though, I guess it's a movie which is best for someone at least 18 yrs old, as then you don't have to watch movies which are ""cool"" and have to be action-related to be good.This movie does not have a lot of ghetto and not a lot happens, but what happens is quite good quality.

I love a feel-good, Rudy Ruettiger, make-a-guy-cry movie as much as the next guy, but this was HORRIBLE!!While watching this movie, I was so embarrassed for the actors who had to belch out this insane dialogue and hollywood-formula BS that I wanted to leave.  D.B. Sweeney, whom I usually enjoy, was lost playing the hardline opposing coach.  Keanu Reeves was in Johnny Utah mode, which would have been great if this was Point Break 2.  I kept waiting for Patrick Swayze to run in and start talking about baseball in terms of the Big Kahuna.Where was the footage of Reeves actually teaching these kids to play baseball???  Or actually helping them to read ""A Wrinkle in Time""? Seemingly, he waved his magic wand and this positive attitude and athletic ability appeared.I had a hard time feeling sorry for Reeves character as a down and out gambler.  More time should have been spent on his fathers death, and the ensuing downward spiral to make you actually FEEL something about Connor O'Neill.  And as a baseball fan, I was offended by the baseball scenes. That was NOT Wrigley Field, or even Comiskey Park.  It looked like old Tiger Stadium.  Either film it at Wrigley, or don't put it in the movie.I hope in 20 years someone remakes this movie and does it right!!",Hardball

84,Sourbunny,One of those heart warming cheesy flicks...with really really bad acting.,5,16 August 2006,"I've seen this movie numerous times it's not bad. The movie itself is very cliché we've seen this all before...it's heartwarming, it was a white person helping out the less fortunate ""ghetto"" kids, and the chemistry w/the kids make u go ""aw"". Yeah thats the only reason I give this movie kudos, I'm a very nice person and i couldn't give it a 1...it's for the kids. Everyone in this movie does a good job acting the kids seem very believable and so do other small roles. Then there's Keanu i don't have anything against him I don't mind the acting in most of his movies, I actually enjoi the Bill and Ted Awesome Adventures. However this movie *ugh it was so bad it really took me out of it, I could tell he's acting, it was like he was reading the lines rite then and there. This movie is nothing special u wont miss anything by not watching it. I guess it's a good movie to watch w/family or something, but i think if ur past the age when u actually appreciate talent and most of your favorites aren't comedies and scary flicks, you'll think it's really utter garbage.",Hardball
85,revfig,"Watchable, but ridiculous",1,16 September 2001,"Warning: Contains spoilersThis movie on first look seems like ""Mighty Ducks"" with black kids and baseball. It seems as if the makers knew this, and shyed away from it by having all of the little kids cuss ... alot. Some of it is funny, but the rest of it is out of line.If you're going to it to see some baseball action, then prepare to be disappointed. The team starts off sucking, like you see in the previews. They suck at the first practice. I mean, they can't hit, throw, catch, field, or do anything right. This carries on to the first game, when they lose horribly. But the second game, they get a new pitcher ... and suddenly the team is the best players ever! There's a play in ""61*"" on HBO that the baseball commentators hail as one of the most amazing plays they ever saw, and these kids duplicate it like its nothing. They show no reason why the team suddenly gets good, except they get a new pitcher.Speaking of unreal baseball, they make every event more ""dramatic"" with pointless dives that are, at some points, five feet away! In one instance, with the bases loaded and 2 outs, one guy hits a little blooper to the first baseman... the pitcher dives horrendously, and the ball goes OVER the pitcher as he dives. To make matters even worse, the kid gets to first base, and the ball lays there in the dirt, right where the first-basemen is supposed to be ... except that there is no first-baseman! They simply forget the fact that the ball was hit right to a position, so they remedy it by eliminating the player! In a real-time situation, the first baseman would easily had caught it, and gotten the last out of the inning.It seems like, halfway through the movie, the producers were like ""Hey! We forgot a villian!"". For this reason, one of the opposing coaches, for no reason at all, suddenly becomes sporadically mean. No reason at all, and he's transformed into a giant dickhead. And so, the ""climax game"" as you see in sports is the pre-championship game against the dickhead coach's team. Naturally they win. Then they go to the championship, show Reeve's speech... and fade out to end. As the credits roll, you see pics of the team with trophies, as if to say ""In case you were wondering, they won the big game, we just didn't feel it was important to show"".One last note, one of the kids gets shot. Hey, I warned you with the spoiler. Anyways, the bullet hole in his chest is like half an inch in diameter, but the only gun ever pointed even near his direction during the scene was a shotgun! Just another example of the unreal nature of this film.This is a feel-good film, as long as you have no concern for cinematography, continuity, unreal moves, or anti-climatic nature. 3/10.",Hardball
86,stevespano,The Bad News Bears meets Dangerous Minds,7,7 September 2001,"Ok,this is a formula film but it works. It's a cross between ""The Bad News Bears"" and ""Dangerous Minds"".It is very well acted by all the kids and Keanu Reeves is good.I could have did without the tear jerker twist but it worked and the audience at the sneak preview ate it up. Diane Lane deserved more screen time but she did the most with what she was given. It's unoriginal but a whole lot better than I expected it to be.  This could be be the fall's first sleeper hit if marketed right.",Hardball
87,npbrown-1,Oh My Gosh!,10,16 September 2001,"I wanted to see this movie when I saw the coming attractions.When I saw it yesterday with my mom I couldn't get my eyes of the screen.Everyone who played in the movie was good.My favorite kids were Andre and Baby G. I recommend this movie to anybody,my rating is 10/10.",Hardball
88,mermieetg,Great Movie for all people,10,7 October 2001,I saw this movie in the cinema. It was funny and at timesit made you cry.  Keanu was very good.  I have all of his movies on DVD and I will purchase this one also. He improves with everything he does.  This movie makes you think and take away something when you leave. You can't ask for anything better in a film.,Hardball
89,Air_Jordan23,Too real for people....AMAZING MOVIE!!!!!,9,25 July 2008,I don't know why this has such a low rating on IMDb. This is one of the the greatest sports movies of all time. I don't think people can handle how real this movie is. I mean your telling me that a story about kids struggling to grow up in a bad part of town is not as good as people fighting in space? GIVE ME A BREAK!!!! Kids trying to make it in the south side of Chicago. Playing baseball so they don't end up in gangs. Now that is real!This is my second favorite sports movie. It is good/true/sad story and if you are not touched by this movie....Go hide in your fantasy land. If you like real movies you will love this movie! 9/10,Hardball
90,happyjoey007,Keanu Reeves is an inspiring person,7,13 February 2020,"Keanu Reeves is the most lovable person on screen and off, he teaches us how to be a good person, work as a team or take matters into your own hands when it comes to the ones you love.",Hardball
91,b_oakley,Good Movie,8,27 December 2013,"Why is everyone so technical? Of course the movie isn't perfect, we don't need that regurgitated in every negative review. I'll read the goofs for that. As a whole, I thought the movie was pretty good. It's has some realistic aspects to it. Yeah, it was a lot of cursing from the kids, but society made that rule. Many ppl are fine with children using profanity. It's just simply words WE pronounced as ""bad."" SMH I'm sure half your children curse like sailors out of your presence. Lol I'm just saying, just with anything else, it's all about perspective. Morals will differ, so no need to bash it bc your morals differ from the director's. I'm not saying you don't have the right to dislike the movie, but damn. We don't need reviews about how badly it was filmed, if you have NO idea how to film it better. Good day. :)",Hardball
92,tomato_rko_66,Baseball team coached by a broke man in debt to bookies,8,29 May 2006,"This movie is awesome Keanu Reeves does a good job, its a good story about a little kids baseball team, that is made up of young kids in a troubled neighbourhood. Coah Connor(Keanu reeves) is in debt to some bookies he keeps getting deeper into a money hole. He gets payed by a friend to coach this baseball team he gets $500 a week. He places a huge $12000 bet on the bulls n Miami game taking the bulls -6 Miami won by 4 n Coach connors life turns around he buys the team proper uniforms takes them to a baseball games & becomes the father they never had. The kekambes start to win games and make it to the ship. with two out at the bottom of the 9th the unlikely hero steps up to the plate, but later on the little boy everyone loved was shot and they all mourned over his loss. The kekambes end up winning the champiuonship",Hardball
93,ssviland,"Well done, but could have been better.",7,8 May 2002,"Contains Spoiler I was surprised at the excellent performance by Keanu Reaves. Diane Lane is an old pro, and an underrated actress. But I watched this because its a baseball movie, and it ranks among those I like, though it falls short of my very favorites. The baseball scenes are very good  believable and they ring true.But there were two major flaws: first of all, Reeves takes the team of Chicago youths to a baseball game  in Detroit's Tiger Stadium. (Apparently other parts of the film were done in Detroit as well.) The Sammy Sosa appears in a uniform without a logo. I suppose the setting could have been 1991, while Sosa and Thomas were both with the Sox, but a drive to Detroit would be far-fetched. But a Cubs-Sox game would not have been in Tiger Stadium. This may not be essential to the story, but it is an essential detail for baseball fans. Secondly, each game takes place at the same park, perhaps because of budgeting purposes. Some league play all games on the same field. But in both games against the team with the ""bad guy"" coach with the nice uniforms, they are the home team on the score board. It would have been a nice touch to go to their field in the first game and then home for the finale. Otherwise, besides some over-the-top sentimentality and the kids being a little TOO easy to win over this movie was enjoyable. My kids were in tears as G lay dying in his brother's arms.",Hardball
94,jesus_charger,Honestly a great sports movie,9,20 May 2019,Movie is freat and worthy of a watch. Honestly don't like how people on here are comparing it to the mighty ducks.. i didnt even think about that movie the first time i watched this .. i felt it has its own charm to stand alone,Hardball
95,superfly169,"Hard Life, small moments",8,2 March 2003,"This is not your typical touchy, feely, kids and coach sports movie.  You all know the type, Might Ducks movies that are an insult to moviegoer's everywhere.  This movie is different from those for one reason; it is about life...real life.  This movie is hardly in the class as those others, I'd say it's in a class of its own. It is never ever predictable, and never fake.  More importantly, it doesn't focus on baseball, baseball is just the media that the some of the scenarios play around.  I don't want to give anything away so a won't say much, but if you come away with anything from this movie it should be this:  No matter how bad or hard life gets, it'll be the small moments in your life that will keep you going, because, as this movie shows, it is in those small moments that life is really lived. You'll see.Feel free write me.",Hardball
96,ndeschepper,A marvelous tale of hope!,10,20 September 2001,"I watched this movie last night and thought it was an exceptional film. It had humor. It was heart-wrenchingly sad. It was a most sobering social commentary, although it did offer the notion that hope, indeed, does spring eternal. It's beyond my comprehension why some folks feel the need to aim such contemptuous and hateful barbs at Keanu Reeves. He gave an outstanding performance,one of his very best, and portrayed the very emotions that Conor, no doubt, would be feeling at any given time. I saw fear, pain, desperation, hopelessness...probably the same feelings I'd have if in the same situation. Conor O'Neill, having dug himself into this pit from hell, the kids being in their own pits from hell through no fault of their own, both needing something or someone; Conor needing redemption and someone to have faith in him since he was fresh out of faith in himself, the kids needing someone they could trust and feel safe with. How providential that they were thrown together! It was uplifting to see both parties bridge the gap and come together, both being able to finally look up and feel that, just maybe, it will be okay to be hopeful. What a transformation for everyone! Keanu has such rapport with these kids! Clearly, his heart was in this one, and clearly, the kids, who all performed admirably, responded to him in kind. Yes, I am a die-hard Keanu fan, and yes, I'll go to my grave declaring that he most certainly CAN act!  My suggestion is this...don't pay attention to the negative reviews. Go see this wonderful movie and decide for yourself. I don't believe you'll be disappointed.",Hardball
97,georgeleslie-42944,Do not listen to the rating!!!! Ridiculously good film!!!,10,9 January 2021,These reviews are absolute bulls**t watched this when I was around 13 watched it ten times since and now 29 and it's still fu**ing tremendous!!!!!!! Defiantly one of my favs!!! These previous reviews need to be seriously looked at and changed!!!!,Hardball
98,juliemagee63,This is why you go to the movies!,10,12 September 2001,"I had no expectations of this film as comments about it were rare or perhaps I'm just too busy with life to read these things. But I found myself in line at the local sneak peek viewing. I quickly got into the movie, suspending disbelief, experiencing things outside of my typical surroundings, and my emotions were tugged, touched and enlightened. I'm still thinking about it, a week later.  This is a great movie. Go see it. The music is fabulous as well. My daughter won't quit singing the ""Papa Song!"".",Hardball
99,stacyp,Touching Movie,10,6 April 2002,"This movie touched my 9 yr old son so much, he made me go out and buy the DVD so that he could watch it over and over!

100,glittergirlie8,very under-rated film,8,16 May 2002,"One sunny afternoon, a man handed me a flier asking me if I would like to see a free screening of a movie.  Who was I to say no???  The movie was Hardball.  As first I was a little hesitant.  I like some of the work that Keanu has done but I can't say that I liked all of it.  Hardball was a pleasant surprise.  The boys made me laugh, the story made me want to cry and at one point I did.  I really do think that Keanu surprised me and made me reconsider my views on his abilities.  Given the right material and good Direction, the man can act.  One scene literally brought my friends and I to tears.  I would recommend this movie to just about anyone.",Hardball
101,soccert14,I liked it and he's a good actor and very good looking.And I think the whole family will be moved by his scensative heroic act.,10,4 June 2002,hardball is about a gambler who needs money to pay off people he owes money to so this guy says he'll give em a job coaching a last place baseball team but then learns to like them as he didn't when first started.I liked it i thought he is a very good actor and hes really hot in hardball and in speed which is very good. And how he helped those kids in the movie made it all worth while but was very sad when he cried and when g-baby died.I liked hardball better because it dealt with helping kids and coming together.,Hardball
