0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not unbearably awful, but I did find it rather dull",4,23 November 2010,"I wanted to like this film. It did look interesting, but when I watched it I was disappointed. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies but for me which were very distracting that was the least of its problems. Granted, the costume and set design are great, and the music was decent. However, the story is disjointed and meanders a lot, and when the film tries to be thrilling the pacing got increasingly sluggish. The script is awful mostly, while neither the direction or acting are anything special. The direction is simplistic, and the acting ranges from okay to cheesy and poor. Overall, this was a film I tried to like, but it was dull and had too many problems for me to even enjoy it. 4/10 Bethany Cox","10,000 BC"
1,Leofwine_draca,Emmerich's worst,2,12 January 2011,"I was never really a huge fan of caveman epics but even by genre standards this has to be one of the worst.Once again, Emmerich has let himself become distracted by the razzle-dazzle of over-elaborate CGI effects, leaving the rest of his movie a complete bore. Supposedly set on earth thousands of years ago, this has absolutely nothing to do with reality and should have been a fantasy piece from the beginning. The story is a little like a kid's version of APOCALYPTO. There the similarities between the two films end.I lost interested about five minutes in, and the only fun came from watching an old EASTENDERS actress playing 'Old Mother'. I kept expecting her to ask whether anybody wanted a cup of tea.The action consists of watching people spearing CGI mammoths to death, or else fleeing from some giant terror-bird creatures in scenes highly reminiscent of Peter Jackson's KING KONG remake. Omar Sharif is the sonorous narrator in an attempt to give the film an epic feel but it doesn't work.Camilla Belle - from the equally diabolical WHEN A STRANGER CALLS remake - plays another vapid character here. The hero is a meathead, and Cliff Curtis (DIE HARD 4.0) never manages to break through the layers of makeup and wig he's hidden behind. Sure, the CGI effects of sabre-toothed tigers, mammoths and the like is pretty good, but that's no reason to sit through a long and dull film.Give this travesty a miss and try Hammer's ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. instead.","10,000 BC"
2,SnoopyStyle,It's stupid ... it's just so stupid,5,22 February 2014,"D'Leh (Steven Strait) is a member of a prehistoric hunter-gatherer tribe called the Yagahl. On a big hunt, he accidentally kills a big mammoth. As a reward, he claims Evolet (Camilla Belle). Later they are attacked by mounted warriors, and many of their tribe are captured. D'Leh, Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis), Ka'Ren (Mo Zinal), and Baku (Nathanael Baring) go off to get their people back.The biggest problem is that this movie is stupid. Director/writer Roland Emmerich has thrown out any science or logic. If you don't care, some of the action can be fun. Or else you could have a good laugh. And the pyramid at end has a lot of action. However the movie slows down too many times. I don't know where the United Nations comes from. It's not a good movie no matter how you look at it.","10,000 BC"
3,claudio_carvalho,Underrated Adventure,7,18 January 2009,"When the child of blue eyes called Evolet is found holding the hands of her dead mother by the tribe of the mammoth hunters Yagahl, their Old Mother (Mona Hammond) tells that the little girl will fulfill an ancient prophecy, marrying the owner of the White Spear and bringing life to their people. Years after, Evolet (Camilla Belle) and the outcast hunter D'Leh (Steven Strait) are in love for each other and D'Leh should dispute the White Spear and Evolet with his rival Ka'Ren (Mo Zainal). However Evolet and many hunters are abducted by the Four-Legged Demons warlords to work as slaves in their distant fields. D'Leh, together with the owner of the White Spear Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis), Ka'Ren and the boy Baku (Nathanael Baring) track the tribe of warriors trying to rescue Evolet and the Yagahl hunters in a dangerous journey through unknown lands. When D'Leh saves a saber-toothed tiger from death, he becomes the leader of oppressed tribes that help him in his quest for freedom, life and love.I was reluctant to see ""10,000 BC"" because of the low IMDb Rating and many bad reviews. However, as a big fan of Camille Belle, I fortunately decided to see this underrated adventure. The entertaining story is a combination of ""Apocalypto"", ""Quest for Fire"" and ""Stargate"" with a romantic situation, supported by magnificent CGI and action scenes. It is funny to read reviews of people that expect historic accuracy in this type of movie; I recommend that they never watch ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", for example, otherwise they may have trouble to sleep My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""10.000 A.C.""

4,classicsoncall,"""He has magical powers. He speaks to the Spear Tooth.""",5,26 December 2018,"The special effects were good and any of the scenes with prehistoric animals were done well, but the story went off the rails when the Yagahls wound up in the land of the tribe that captured Evolet (Camilla Belle) and the others. All of a sudden, prehistoric times met a relatively advanced civilization that had conquered domesticating mammoths to do their work for them, and huge buildings and pyramid structures that were light years ahead of D'Leh's (Steven Strait) people. None of that seemed credible, even for a movie that you knew going in wasn't going to be credible in the first place. I think you know you're in trouble when a flick with the word 'BC' in it has a female character like Evolet who's mascara begins to run when she starts crying. Not that Ms. Belle didn't have a reason to cry to be cast in this story, especially when her character is magically saved from death by the mysterious link shared with Old Mother (Mona Hammond) who does die to revive the story's heroine.Best line in the movie - when D'Leh says to the sabretooth, ""Do not eat me when I set you free."" Who came up with that one?","10,000 BC"
5,jboothmillard,"10,000 Bc",3,6 February 2011,"From director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow), the trailer that I saw might have been reasonable looking, at the time I wasn't keen on seeing at the cinema, but certainly later on I would, and I did. Basically this is a prehistoric epic set in the year 10,000 B.C. , the time when the pyramids were built, following the journey of a young mammoth hunter named D'Leh (Steven Strait). He travels over and through vast lands and uncharted territories, of snow, grass and sand deserts, to secure a future for his tribe. The Yaghal tribe is raided by a rival tribe of horse-riding warlords, they kidnap the beautiful love interest of D'Leh, Evolet (Camilla Belle), and some other people heading towards the end of the world. He of course begins a long trek to rescue her, going against more mammoths, going face to face with a large sabre-toothed tiger (or ""sharp-tooth"" to them) that he saves, and nasty birds. Also starring Whale Rider's Cliff Curtis as Tic'Tic, Joel Virgel as Nakudu, Nathanael Baring as Baku, Joel Fry as Lu'Kibu and Mona Hammond as Old Mother, with narration by Omar Sharif. I was expecting this film to be mostly silent, or at least having mostly a never heard before language, this is meant to be the same kind of time period as Stargate, the special effects may have been okay, but the plot (if any) is very slow, the acting is terrible, and I just found most of it rather boring, a disappointing prehistoric adventure. Adequate!","10,000 BC"
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Yeah, It's True What They Are Writing Here",3,10 July 2008,"I was hoping to like this movie, to give it a better review than most might give it....but I couldn't. In the end, I had to agree with the reviewers here on IMDb, that this movie stinks. It's true.It's also one of those films that starts off okay, lures you in, and then deteriorates. With 40 minutes to go in the two-hour film, you're ready to walk out but since you've invested 80 minutes you figure, ""I might as well see it through the end."" The last half hour then becomes like a session at the dentist's office in which you can't wait for the experience to be over.Credibility is probably the worst aspect of this film. Seeing people 10,000 years ago in buildings that look pretty well-made and would do an architect proud today, and hearing people speak with British and other assorted accents - in the same tribe - for the time and place (Mideast or Northern Africa in 10,000 B.C.) almost makes one laugh out loud in spots.....yet this is supposed to be a serious movie. The special-effects were weak, especially with the saber-toothed tiger which not only looks very fake but is proportionally ludicrous. The mammoths didn't look at hokey, but they moved very woodenly, computer-like. This was mainly the reason I watched. I knew it might be stupid but I thought it might at least be fun with eye-popping effects. No, nothing was eye-popping here.It was just dumb....and I didn't even get to the story part, if you want to call it that. Actually, that was the worst part of this film. The screenplay was embarrassingly bad. If you want details on the holes in this story and all the things that were impossible but shown here, check out the other reviews.Folks: you can believe all the negative reviews here on IMDb. They are not lying.","10,000 BC"
7,ma-cortes,"Prehistoric tale plenty of adventures and primitive animals as Mammoth, Sabretooth and big bird",6,6 August 2009,"The story deals about a a young hunter named D'Leh (Steven Strait) happily living in his prehistoric tribe which dedicates the mammoth hunt. When a group of horse-riding warriors (Ben Badra) attack his tribe and abduct his love interest named Evolet (Camilla Belle), he sets out in pursuit accompanied by Tic Tic(Cliff Curtis). They must confront several dangers and risks, such as a Sabretooth, giant bird (Roc), savage mammoth and many others. They travel through uncharted landscapes towards an unknown territory .This exciting picture is full of action, emotion, feats, thrills, a love story and is pretty amusing . Steven Strait as young and valiant warrior is nice, he's driven by love and destiny to impressive adventures . Camilla Belle in one of his first roles as adult girl is very good, shining her playing as gorgeous Evolet. Excellent secondary role for Cliff Curtis as tough and self-sacrificing warrior , furthermore Omar Shariff as narrator in off . Stirring and evocative musical score by Harald Kloser(also producer and writer) . Colorful cinematography reflecting splendidly the breathtaking outdoors by Ueli Steiger (Godzilla, Day after tomorrow) , Emmerich's usual. The picture is lavishly produced by Emmerich, Harald Kloser and Mark Gordon. Overwhelming special effects and creature designs by Tatopoulus Studios. The flick is professionally directed by Roland Emmerich. He's a good director, writer and producer who founded along with Dean Devlin the company Centropolis Entertainment. Emmerich is an expert on making movies for the masses and specialist on large-scale disaster movies (Day after tomorrow,Independence day ) and spectacular stories (Stagate,The patriot, Universal soldier), recently and in production he's shooting an epic adventure about global cataclysm that brings an end to the world , titled '2012'.","10,000 BC"
8,michaelRokeefe,Pre-Historic epic falls short of hype.,7,3 July 2008,"Director Roland Emmerich's 10,000 BC is very likable, but really fails to garner the interest created by its trailers. Relying a lot on fantastic CGI to support this caveman adventure. A village is ravaged by ""demons with four legs"", raiders on horseback. A pretty young woman Evolet(Camilla Belle)is kidnapped and her admirer D'Leh(Steven Strait)will go on a bold trek in hopes of bringing her home. D'Leh is also heavy hearted in attempts to fulfill his prophetic destiny...following in the likeness of his heroic father. D'Leh will survive a mammoth hunt, come nose to nose in a battle with a saber-tooth tiger and will form a massive army to cross uncharted sandy wilderness to discover a lost civilization and his heart's desire Evolet. D'Leh will lead the fight liberating a multitude of slaves and immortalize his feat. My favorite sequences are that of the mammoth hunt and the attack of pre-historic dino-birds. Also in the cast: Cliff Curtis, Joel Virgel, Affif Ben Badra, Mona Hammond, Marco Khan, Nathaniel Baring and narration by the great Omar Sharif.","10,000 BC"

10,poolandrews,Entertains with some spectacular effects but the plot is shallow.,4,14 February 2011,"10,000 BC is set thousands of year in the past where the primitive Yaghal tribe live on snowy mountains, a young man named D'Leh (Steven Strait) has grown up in partial disgrace as his father abandoned the tribe when he was a young boy. D'Leh takes part in a Mammoth hunt & manages to kill one all on his own with a little bit of luck, D'Leh is hailed as a brave hero & awarded the sacred & prized White Spear. D'Leh also comes to the attention of Evolet (Camilla Belle) whom he has liked for years, just as a romance develops between D'Leh & Evolet the tribe is attacked by horsemen & Evolet along with several other's are kidnapped & taken. D'Leh & a few other's decide to go after their captured friends & after weeks of pursuing D'Leh discovers that Evolet & the other's are just a few of several thousand slaves being used to build the Pyramids, D'Leh leads a revolt against the slavers in an attempt to free the thousands held there...This American & South African co-production was co-written, produced & directed by Roland Emmerich & is a prehistoric adventure that isn't particularly interested in historic accuracy as much as visual spectacle, while I liked 10,000 BC enough as a big budget special effects extravaganza I found the plot & just about everything else empty & lacking. For a start a film set such a long time ago is difficult to pull off, for a start if your going for historic authenticity then no-one in your film can speak English. One Million Years B.C. (1966) for instance is a film where the primitives cavemen just grunt, here in 10,000 BC everyone speaks perfect English. Then there's the fact that all sorts of prehistoric creatures are used from lots of different eras & locations like here as a Mammoth is used to help build one of the Egyptian Pyramids! The film ignores the fact that there were no human civilisations of significance in 10,000 BC & the Pyramids certainly weren't being built at that point. As an adventure film 10,000 BC is shallow, the character's are thin & at times I personally found it hard to tell who was who as everyone looked the same with dreadlocks & messy beards & the whole destiny & prophecy aspect doesn't work at all. We never really learn why the main bad guy is bad, where all these prophecies come from or what they mean or what happened to D'Leh's father despite the fact he left the tribe is referred to many times. The script plays itself as a straight drama without seeming to know the silliness of it all, unfortunately 10,000 BC is a drama where you don't care about anyone & they never work. Fact. At just over one hour & forty minutes 10,000 BC can drag at times although it is very nice to look at even if the story is simple & there's nothing of any depth here.There are several CGI set-pieces including a really great Mammoth hunt at the start which is dramatic & exciting even if I did feel a little sorry for the Mammoth. The sweeping shots of the Pyramids being built by slaves are impressive & look fantastic although a Saber Tooth Tiger looks poor in comparison to the rest of the effects work. L'Deh is 'Held' spelt backwards which in German means 'hero' which German director Emmerich cheekily put in there. The giant flesh eating bird scene looks good as well, the scenery is often stunning from the lush green jungles to the snow covered mountains to the huge expanse of the desert 10,000 BC is a great looking but soulless film.With a supposed budget of about $105,000,000 no expense was spared it seems, filmed in New Zealand & Namibia. The acting is OK, the film is multilingual which gets annoying at times & no-one really stands out. Oscar winning Egyptian actor Omar Sharif provides the narration.10,000 BC is sporadically entertaining & has some great visuals but is as shallow as they come, takes itself far too seriously & is only slightly more accurate & based in reality than The Flintstones (1960 - 1966). Not a bad way to waste a couple of hours but 10,000 BC is nothing special.","10,000 BC"
11,CinemaSerf,Stargate with bones and mammoths...,5,5 December 2019,This is about a lad (Steven Strait with dreads) from a mountain tribe who only aspires to be a great mammoth hunter until raiders come and take away the love of his life. So off he sets with a few of his friends to rescue her; battling some giant dodo-like birds with menacing beaks; making friends with a sabre toothed tiger as his courage never waivers from his daunting quest. It is formulaic and predictable but if you like boys-own adventure stories then this will pass an hour and 40 minutes without troubling your brain or your vocabulary. Omar Sharif narrates this technically well made piece of cinema which I am astonished to see took over a quarter of a billion dollars at the box-office!,"10,000 BC"

Give 'em points for having a dark skinned cast in an African setting, take points away for silliness and historical inaccuracy. Let me just say the problems with the film begin with every creature being several times than it was in real life continue on with wildly uneven visual effects and moves from there. Forget the illogic of the plotting-why would the bad guys travel so far?- This movie is a total mess so much so that its neither fun nor interesting.

13,Bunuel1976,"10,000 B.C. (Roland Emmerich, 2008) **",4,31 August 2008,"I hadn't rented a contemporary film in ages, but decided to check this one out to take some time off the ""Euro-Cult"" phase I'm currently going through; unfortunately, it turned out to be a lackluster affair and hardly worth the time invested in it (I do have two more  I'M NOT THERE [2007] and THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL [2008]  which I hope will emerge to be far more rewarding)! Anyway, the film obviously recalls the quirky prehistoric Hammer outing ONE MILLION YEARS, B.C. (1966); however, while that one had the guts to completely eschew the use of intelligible dialogue, this incongruously has the nominal tribe speak perfect English and all the others in an indistinct 'foreign' tongue (the latter are even able to communicate with each another, but their language is not understood by the heroes and his people)! Anyway, though the film tries to get by on the virtues of spectacle and action (since the plot is incredibly clichéd), the whole is considerably undermined by the excessive reliance on fake-looking (you don't say) CGI effects  none more so, perhaps, than the ""Spear Tooth"" tiger creature (the appearance of which is rendered redundant and incoherent by having its introduction relegated to the cutting room floorerdeleted scenes section of the DVD! Still, the acting is woefully inadequate as well  the hero is bland, the heroine good-looking but underused and the villains stereotyped (including the all-too-human 'God')  as is Emmerich's uninspired direction. In any case, in films like these, it's always the technical aspects  and especially the relentlessly booming (and enveloping) soundtrack  which provides the biggest draw to potential viewers. By the way, the scenes featuring Omar Sharif (playing the boy who idolizes the hero as an adult) also ended up being discarded  and all that's left of his contribution is the intermittent narration!","10,000 BC"
14,utgard14,Made me feel dumber just watching it,3,23 June 2015,"Laughable hokum from Roland Emmerich about a prehistoric man on a quest to rescue his woman. Steven Strait plays our hero in love with Camilla Belle, who sports an unconvincing pair of blue contact lenses. They're distracting really. One day some foreign raiders show up and kidnap a bunch of people from Strait's tribe, including Belle. Strait heads off in pursuit, accompanied by Cliff Curtis and a few others. Curtis, by the way, is the only actor who comes out of all this smelling like a rose. The others just can't rise above the silliness they're stuck with. Anyway they follow the raiders and eventually catch up, briefly rescuing Belle only to lose her again. Where the movie goes from there I don't want to spoil because it has to be seen to be believed. Some of the special effects are good but they get spottier as the movie goes along. The saber-tooth tiger is cartoon-interacting-with-human stuff. The action scenes are not impressive, especially the chase scenes where things move so quickly and get jumbled together that you have trouble keeping track of which person you're watching being chased. Is it dark dreadlocks guy in fur #1, #2, or #3? Oh wait it's dark dreadlocks GIRL in fur this time. My mistake. They all look alike from behind. It's a silly movie by its very concept. If it didn't take itself so seriously it might have been more fun. But it does and it isn't. If you do watch it, look out for those giant ostriches. They're trouble.","10,000 BC"
15,zardoz-13,Calling Fred Flintstone!,5,13 March 2008,"The romantic fantasy adventure ""10,000 B.C."" resembles a gentler, kinder, younger version of Mel Gibson's bloodthirsty, R-rated ""Apocalypto."" Predictable for all of its generic 109 minutes, this derivative PG-13 epic qualifies as little more than slickly-made hokum for teens that haven't seen better movies. The scenic ""10,000 B.C."" borrows bits and pieces from ""The Jungle Book,"" ""Braveheart,"" ""Mysterious Island,"" the John Wayne western ""The Searchers,"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" The impressive computer-generated special effects that recreate the era impart more depth than the simple-minded screenplay by ""Independence Day"" writer & director Roland Emmerich and co-scribe Harald Kloser. The most exciting scenes depict ersatz larger-than-life animals. First, huge woolly mammoths go on the rampage twice with suspenseful results. These brutes boast tusks the size of tree branches and resemble the offspring of a prehistoric Mastodon and the ""Sesame Street"" critter Mr. Snuffleupagus. Later, a saber-tooth tiger confronts our hero in a pit and they eyeball each other. This shallow, occasionally amusing, formulaic Mesolithic melodrama chronicles a teenaged warrior's efforts to rescue his sweetheart from a marauding band of savage horsemen. These marauders ride for a personage called 'the Almighty,' and this pseudo-deity has one village after another enslaved as labor for his pyramid-building schemes.""10,000 B.C."" opens with actor Omar Sharif narrating the story. Sharif's narration clarifies nothing that anybody with half of a brain couldn't have figured out alone. Anyway, the story occurs in the prehistoric past in the Valley of Yagahi where native hunters have raised families for generations. This tribe of hunters depends on killing great shaggy mammoths that provide them with meat, fuel, clothing, and building materials in the same way either the buffalo served the Plains Indians or whales served Eskimo tribes. Times, however, are changing, and the biggest change occurs when Yagahi hunters find the lost child, the lone survivor of a slain people, and usher her into their camp. The tribal spirit woman, Old Mother (Mona Hammond of ""Dr. Who: The Rise of the Cybermen""), embraces young, blue-eyed Evolet (nubile Camilla Belle of ""Practical Magic"") and experiences a glimpse of the frightening future. Old Mother prophesizes that Evolet will assume a prominent role in the tribe's destiny. She also proclaims that a champion will arise to wed Evolet and lead their people.As a child, the hero D'Leh (Steven Strait of ""Undiscovered"") struggles with prejudice. His father abandoned the tribe without explanation and so D'Leh is an object of scorn by all but the warrior Tic'Tic (Cliff Curtis of ""Blow"") who promised D'Leh's dad that he'd raise him like his own son. As children, D'Leh and Evolet fall in love, and our hero vows to never leave her. Later, when he learns that Evolet will be forced to marry the best hunter, D'Leh resolves to defeat his competitors. He slays the biggest mammoth more by luck than skill and claims not only the prized tribal white spear but also Evolet. Eventually, D'Leh confesses and gives up both Evolet and the spear. Before they can elope, a horde of treacherous brigands known as 'the four-legged demons' for the horses that they ride when they attack the Yagahi village and take prisoners. Later, D'Leh has a close encounter with a sacred saber-toothed tiger and lives to tell about it. He assembles a multiethnic, army of African warriors to follow him to the villain's riverside setting. The Almighty, an unseen Goliath in a veil, has scores of mastodons employed to pull the gigantic stones up ramps into place. Our heroes infiltrate the slave camp and incite a rebellion.Some scenes seem inadvertently funny. For example, when the villainous slavers drive the villagers into a sea of high grass, the carnivores that they encounter look hilarious. They look like the offspring of the T-Rex from ""Jurassic Park"" and the giant goofy chicken in the Jules Verne movie ""Mysterious Island."" Meanwhile, director Roland Emmerich deliberately chose to have the heroes speak in English while the villains snarl in a guttural dialect that requires subtitles. Happily, Burt Reynolds look-alike Stephen Strait and Elizabeth Taylor look-alike Camilla Belle make a convincing couple, but their romance is strictly your typical boy-gets-gal, boy-loses-gal, and then boy-wins-gal back. Sadly, ""10,000 B.C."" breaks no new ground with either its storytelling or its stunts. Altogether, the storytelling is bland to the point of being generic and the stunts are as tame as the violence is bloodless.","10,000 BC"
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The animated material is more real than the emotion,1,22 March 2008,"Before you read this review, know that I am not bothered by the utter lack of historical accuracy(not much, at the very least). I went to a Roland Emmerich film expecting effects and not... really anything else of value. You only really go to something he's done anticipating story or characters worth remembering or thinking about beyond leaving the theater(failing that, wherever you did sit down, stand up or otherwise exist with your eyes at least occasionally fixed in the general direction of the screen it was appearing on), once, right, that one time being the first, last and only time... after that, only the fewest give him another chance and expect the two to be more than just there to create situations in which the visual extravaganza could come to be. Nevertheless, this is probably the one where the two were at their weakest, at least of the ones I've seen. The plot is poor, and, save for the precious few interesting elements, instantly forgettable. The characters are thin as well as story, and neither are developed all that much. The former reveals a lot of sloppiness, as there is no real growth, and at least one part could be written out with absolutely no impact on the film(while others merely stay hidden once they've fulfilled their purpose). The acting, well, the biggest(only?) ""name"" in that regard is the narrator(poor Sharif, having to say such silly things), and while that doesn't always mean that it's bad, it is, here. The effects are really about the only particularly remarkable aspect, and given that, they actually could have been better, at least at some points(and the actors' interactions with them are almost without exception awkward). There's little action, and what there is comes off as dull, in choreography and execution. Apart from some amusement which I doubt the creators of this intended for(when this tried to be funny, it seldom was), this didn't make me feel *anything*. Dialog tends to be stupid, at times reaching the point of being downright ridiculous. Direction is lazy. Between the character almost named the same as the well-known breath mint, the language barrier being inconsequential and the sometimes giggle-inviting costumes, there's just enormously little of value to be found herein. I recommend this only to those who *must* watch VFX pieces, and least of all those wanting anything remotely based on real life... but for anyone worrying that this will make kids believe wrong ""facts"" about the age supposedly depicted in this movie, try not to worry... it's rather dubious that much of anything in this will remain in any viewer's mind for noticeably long. 1/10","10,000 BC"

Only thing being that a) it's all fairly tedious and boring, b) it's vastly improbable (even if you accept the anachronisms), and c) none of the stuff which needs explaining gets explained. Who or what is the last surviving pyramid building tyrant, for instance? We deserved a proper look at him after the teases, but didn't get one. And what about the mystic cavewoman wise one / witch? What was going on there? What was the point of the Androcles thing other than for the sabretoooth to impress the tribe? OK, there was the prophecy, but it seemed a shame for the sabretooth to then disappear from the proceedings completely.Camilla Belle is strikingly pretty, with amazingly white teeth (for a cavegirl), gorgeous blue eyes, and eyebrows to die for. Sadly, she appears to be completely unable to act. Steven Strait's performance ensures that his career returned from whence it came ie. nowhere - he has less charisma than one of the mammoths. A dead one.The final set piece is rather good fun, but you know you're in trouble when two of your main three characters are called Delay and Dick-Dick.","10,000 BC"

Great idea that becomes too ridiculous right up to a conclusion where a mammoth brings someone back to life in some sort of spiritual CPR. Directed by Roland Emmerich whose previous big budget embarrassments include Independence Day and Godzilla. Sure, those films were successful but that just means that suckers are born with every marketing effort. He relies totally on visual elements to sell such as a tremendous mammoth hunting sequence. The tribe speaks English and they are played by actors who look nothing like tribesmen. It's as if the producers lifted them out of a costume party and put wigs on them. It is the highest form of laziness in a film. Steven Strait and Camilla Belle are the bunt of a bad joke. Straight is somehow able to buddy up to a saber-tooth cat. Another five minutes and it's certain they would be sharing a beer together. To bad he didn't buddy up to a better screenwriter. Belle is ridiculous with her blue eyes and an image that resembles nothing of any tribe. Only Cliff Curtis passes the test as Straight's mentor. Displaying prehistoric lifestyles fails miserably. Score: 4 ½ / 10","10,000 BC"
20,Wuchakk,"Expand your ""circle of love""",7,13 March 2014,"I LOVE primitive-type films like ""One Million Years B.C.,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Beneath TPOTA,"" ""Sands of the Kalahari"" and Tarzan, which of course explains my interest in Roland Emmerich's 2008 film ""10,000 B.C."" (even despite the mediocre reviews and the fact that I dislike other Emmerich films like ""Independence Day"").What do you expect in seeing a film titled ""10,000 B.C""? ""Citizen Kane""? No, you would expect raw, primordial landscapes, mountains, deserts and jungles, cavemen & cavebabes, chiseled bods with zero fat, giant beasts of terror and ominous music. ""10,000 B.C."" has all this and, surprisingly, more.THE PLOT: The mammoths are slowly disappearing in the desolate regions where D'Leh's tribe dwells, but when a herd finally appears he proves his courage. A band of slavers raids D'Leh's camp and make off with his beloved Evolet and others. They are pursued into the jungles and desert and many peoples of other tribes join the cause to end the slave raids. The journey brings profound spiritual growth to D'Leh as his ""Circle of love"" expands to include far more than merely Evolet and his tribe.The landscapes are breathtaking: The mountainous scenes were filmed in New Zealand, the jungle scenes in South Africa and the desert segment in Namibia.Many of the visuals are magnificent, like the slave ships and their red butterfly sails. Great cinematography.Much of the F/X work is great, like the woolly mammoths, but the sabertooth tiger is a tad fake-looking, albeit serviceable. The entire mammoth hunt segment is incredible filmmaking and truly thrilling.D'Leh and his associates are all likable while the slavers & pyramid people are fittingly loathsome. Great casting. D'Leh is played by Steven Strait and Evolet by Camilla Belle. You'll note that Camilla has one of the most beautiful faces you'll ever see, especially in the close-ups.Some have criticized that D'Leh's tribe speaks English (while other tribes speak different languages). Aduh, the filmmakers were hoping that viewers have a brain and can figure out that they aren't really speaking English (modern English didn't exist for another 9,750 years or so); D'Leh's tribe are obviously speaking some caveman lingo like every other tribe, but the filmmakers have translated their language for our convenience so we don't have to read subtitles the entire film.""10,000 B.C."" is not a remake of 1966's ""One Million Years B.C."" (the one with Raquel Welch). The basic plot is the same as Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" but there's enough difference to make ""10,000 B.C."" worthwhile. In fact, even though ""10,000 B.C."" is more cartooney than ""Apocalypto"" you get more bang for your buck. ""Apocalypto"" may have more action but ""10,000 B.C."" has a better variety of locations and breathtaking landscapes. Not to mention ""Apocalypto's"" message is simpler: Civilization bad, rural tribes good, invaders from across the sea evil incarnate. ""10,000 B.C."", by contrast, has depth that transcends the usual action/adventure fare. Love is a theme. There's a scene where D'Leh (still a kid) grabs Evolet's hand and declares his undying love for her. Unrealistic? Not really. Kids back then would naturally be more developed at an earlier age due to the fact that they weren't spoiled or distracted from spiritual growth by absent parents, materialism, video games, Britney Spears, MTV, smart phones and the internet (or whatever). Anyway, D'Leh's love for Evolet later propels him to take the long journey to rescue her and the other tribe members. During this journey his ""circle of love"" grows well beyond just Evolet, blood kin and fellow tribesmen to encompass many peoples of varying races and even a sabertooth tiger (!) (think Marvel's Ka-Zar, Lord of the Hidden Jungle). I wasn't expecting this.That's right, the film even addresses love and respect for animals. For instance, D'Leh has the opportunity to slay a ferocious beast but instead decides to save it despite the possibility of being devoured or mauled. Also, his tribe regularly kills the mighty mammoths for necessities but they clearly respect the beast. Later in the film they are shocked to see the ""civilized"" pyramid people abuse the great animals.In ""10,000 B.C."" love is like a warm life-giving ray of sun in a cold, rugged world. This is very different to the subtext of ""One Million Years B.C."" which blatantly states in the opening narration that the world is a hard and unfriendly place. Generally speaking, the message of ""One Million Years B.C."" is that life in this world is hard, hateful and meaningless, whereas the moral of ""10,000 B.C."" is that life is indeed hard, but it doesn't have to be hateful, hopeless or meaningless, and love indeed conquers all (that is, if people are open to it).Some have criticized the many mystical elements in the story but, despite what Spock-like intellectuals would have you believe, life extends far beyond the limited parameters of science and reason. How do we explain the numerous mysteries of life and the universe? How do we explain the amazing prophecy the Aztecs had concerning Cortes and his arrival? A few years ago a prophet who didn't know me from Adam called me up (from my seat) and spoke over me for a few minutes. He miraculously knew things and ""predicted"" others that he couldn't possibly have known apart from a powerful spiritual gift. People who view life EXCLUSIVELY from the scope of reason and science limit themselves and their perspective.Don't listen to the overly critical reviewers. No, it's not a perfect film -- the final Act falters, losing the captivating appeal of the first two Acts -- and, yes, there's a bit of cartoonishness, but ""10,000 B.C."" surprisingly exceeds the superficiality of most action/adventure flicks.GRADE: B","10,000 BC"
21,zetes,Just plain boring between the all too few action sequences,4,23 March 2008,"Roland Emmerich isn't a very good director, I'll readily admit, but he's made a few entertaining movies. I might feel guilty about enjoying Stargate, Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, but I won't deny that I did enjoy them. His new film was advertised as an action extravaganza involving woolly mammoths and saber-tooth tigers. I expected it to be ham-fisted, but I also thought it looked like it should be a moderately fun picture. My modest expectations were not at all met. Don't get me wrong, the action sequences delivered. The special effects were great, and the set pieces were decently exciting. But, man, are they few and far between. There are pretty much three of these set pieces in the film, a mammoth hunt, an encounter with gigantic, man-eating birds, and the whole climactic slave rebellion. Prepare to be gravely disappointed with the saber-toothed tiger, if you were hoping for something cool there. Between these sequences are endless bits where undefined pre-historic tribesmen sit around chatting it up in faux-primitive English, which consists of simple sentences and the lack of contractions. It's hard to even sit through at these times, and it's one of the few movies I've seen at a theater where I seriously contemplated falling asleep.","10,000 BC"
22,DICK STEEL,"A Nutshell Review: 10,000 B.C.",7,5 March 2008,"I guess not everyone has the audacity like Mel Gibson in taking risks related to the language used in their movies, for artistic integrity reasons. Passion of the Christ and Apocalypto both did not have their characters spout English, and had subtitles for the audience to rely on instead. And for a movie based in the era that its title states - 10,000 years before the birth of Christ - I do not suppose for one instance that our ancestral forefathers back in those days speak simple English, if at all. Then again, this is entertainment for the masses we're talking about.The main draw of 10,000 BC was of course the interaction of man and humongous, dangerous beasts of the time, and how through ingenuity in our natural ability to milk the Earth to make tools, mankind has ruled the Earth until now. But if like me you're expecting huge action pieces involving mammoths and sabre tooth tigers, what you get in their place are gentle elephants who go on a rampage no different from having computers plaster the correct bodykits over stampeding bulls, and a sabre tooth tiger count of ONE, and a pussy cat at that too.In essence, 10,000 BC tells of so simple a story, you'll believe that back then even hunky guys have their work cut out when they're going after the girl of their dreams. It's basically boy chases girl across the vast mountains and plains of the known world, because he had chosen to honour integrity than to win her hand over a mistaken recognition of bravery. And naturally to make our hero D'leh (Steven Strait) regret this decision, his lady love Evolet (Camilla Belle) and his fellow villages get enslaved and marched to Egypt to build pyramids for the gods (OK, so I'm stretching that last statement). Villains are extremely weak, as they just have to look menacing without actually bringing across the feeling of immense threats that could be fatally carried out.Before you say that it's a carbon copy of the plot in Mel's Apocalypto and many others ranging as far back as Stargate, while Apocalypto had a man trying to save his family, this one's more of a pursuit of individual interests. And through his quest, a hero within D'leh will arise in a sort of coming of age tale of a prophetic savior who will lead everybody to salvation and to the promised land. Yes, tales of The One cliché get plastered at every possible instance that you'll roll your eyes when the plot tries to throw some red herrings along the way in meek attempts to spice things up. And as each prophecy get explained, the more ridiculous it becomes, and when an ancient badly rendered drawing is shown carved against a rock in colour, you know that this is supposed to be one cartoony movie after all.Throw in some pathos about a long lost father, sacred weapons, and even a memorable fight scene in a bamboo forest (I kid you not this time), you'll have enough material here to feel a sense of familiarity throughout the story, surviving on the novelty of having set some thousands of years ago. One thing you'll learn though, is that it pays being a gatherer and hunter with excellent javelin skills, and even Leonidas will have to kowtow to.","10,000 BC"
23,JamesHitchcock,"If you've ever wanted to watch a mammoth hunt, this is the film for you",6,10 April 2008,"""10,000 BC"" is a film which has come in for more than its fair share of vitriol, both on this board and elsewhere. Much of the criticism has been directed at the vast number of historical, geographical and zoological howlers; anyone who enjoys playing ""spot the goof"" as much as I do will find much to keep them amused.It did, however, occur to me that the film was not intended to be taken as seriously as the legion of goof-spotters might have imagined. I doubt if Roland Emmerich ever meant to make a film which gave us an accurate picture of life on Earth twelve thousand years ago, any more than the makers of ""One Million Years BC"" (aka ""How Raquel Welch Invented the Bikini"") intended a serious depiction of life in the Pleistocene era. It struck me that if the film is interpreted as a sort of fantasy along the lines of ""Lord of the Rings"" it is actually not all that bad.The hero is a young mammoth-hunter named D'Leh. (This is, apparently, derived from ""Held"", the German word for ""Hero"", spelt backwards. Herr Emmerich, however, evidently failed to realise that in English this would sound like the word ""delay""). Most of the film deals with D'Leh's quest to rescue various members of his tribe who have been captured by a gang of horsemen and carted off to a desert kingdom where they are being used as slave labour to construct vast pyramid-like structures. Among the captives is D'Leh's sweetheart, Evolet. (And you can stop looking in the dictionary: ""Telove"" does not mean anything in German).The plot has something in common with Mel Gibson's recent ""Apocalypto"", although I would not rate it as highly as that film. I certainly would not rate it as highly as Peter Jackson's magnificent ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, which has an epic scope and vision lacking here. Jackson was also able to call upon excellent acting from the likes of Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee, whereas the acting in ""10,000 BC"" is functional at best. The film also lacks the serious purpose of ""Apocalypto"", in which Gibson was making some serious points about man's inhumanity to man.Emmerich seems to specialise in making large-scale films which are undemanding but spectacular, such as ""Independence Day"" and ""The Patriot"", and ""10,000 BC"" is another of the same sort. It will never be regarded as a cinema classic, but it is an enjoyable adventure story of the sort that has been popular ever since the stories of King Arthur and his knights were first written, and probably for a lot longer even than that. (""Gallant warrior overcomes evil tyrant and wins the beautiful lady""). And those CGI mammoths were a lot of fun. If you've ever wondered what a mammoth hunt might be like, this is the film for you. 6/10","10,000 BC"
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,I never realized how good the dental insurance was back then for cave men,1,9 March 2008,"OK, after hearing many horrible reviews for 10,000 BC, I have to say that I was really put off, this I was assuming was supposed to be the big kick off to the huge block busters. But I got to see it for free, and I always think that sometimes people just misjudge a film, even though my co-worker warned me, I still went for it and saw it. Thank God the movie ended when it did, I had the neuce around my neck by the end of this film. I mean, seriously, did the ""writer"" do any history homework?! First off, let's talk about appearances, the ""cave men"" have perfect teeth, have evolved well for what's supposed to be over 10,000 years ago, and remove the dirt, they're skin belongs in a Neutragina ad. Script? Was there one? I have no idea, the story made absolutely no sense and the ending was horrible. I don't want to give away what happens, but trust me, I think you'll be as confused as I was.I'm going to try my best to explain the plot to you, it's high school drama with cave men, so bare with me. De'Leh is a cave man with his tribe and has earned the title of ""best warrior"", he is allowed to have any woman, so he picks his childhood sweet heart, Evolet, but he later feels as if he didn't earn that right, so he ""gives her up"". She is kidnapped by another gang, oh, no! Whatever will he do? He gave her up, but he still digs her and never even got a kiss! So he goes after her with a few of his friends and find themselves fighting saber-tooth's, monstrous snow storms, a snake river, and even a god who got a bad nail job. Oh, let's hope he can save his girlfriend in time and all will be well.That's the Cliff's Notes version I can come up with. May I just say that I absolutely loved how the cave men spoke perfect English, seriously, I didn't realize that it was possible for them to speak that well in American English. This script was written for 12 year old's, seriously. Then they put in these awkward jokes, strange characters that are more laughable than serious, and a love story that would seriously be so non-existent if this was an accurate portrayal of history. I don't mind when they ""bend"" the truth for dramatic purposes, but this was the friggin' Seasamse Street version of cave men history. Stay away from this trash, it's just a waste of time, sadly, how many good movies could have been made with the budget they probably put onto this film? I'm seeing at least 7 already.1/10","10,000 BC"
25,Rainey-Dawn,A Badly Underrated Film,8,29 June 2014,"I do not care if there are anachronisms or not in this film - it's good! I found it to be an interesting story with beautiful mammoth sized cinematography. The way the movie is filmed it looks as if the film-makers were going for an Epic and they did it by my standards.I love the ""Hyborian Age"" type of films. It's a world of fantasy, sword and sorcery, barbarians and other magical ideas. ""10,000 BC"" does fit somewhat well into this category.If you loved the ""Conan"" films(1982 or 2011) or enjoy movies with a caveman theme like ""Missing Link (1988) "" and "" Iceman (1984)"" then you might like the movie ""10,000 BC"".I believe this movie is rated way to poorly - badly underrated on IMDb.8.5/10","10,000 BC"
26,Buddy-51,Destined to be a camp classic?,4,23 March 2008,"About the best thing that can be said for ""10,000 B.C."" is that it at least doesn't have the human characters sharing screen time with a bunch of rampaging dinosaurs (which puts it light years ahead of ""One Million Years B.C."" in terms of historical realism, though that's not exactly a very high bar for any film to get over). But that's about the only anachronism that doesn't find its way into this film, which seems otherwise designed to give any serious anthropologist or historian a severe case of the professional heebie-jeebies. For here is a movie in which people live in thatch-roofed villages, travel on elaborately designed wooden sailboats, and worship at massive pyramids and temples, thousands of years before any of those things actually existed. Of course, one doesn't expect to find the stark documentary realism of a ""Quest For Fire"" in any project by Roland Emmerich - the purveyor of such high class pop culture schlock as ""Independence Day,"" ""Godzilla,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" etc. - but couldn't somebody have done at least a modicum of historical research before sending this out to a public as woefully uninformed about ancient history as polls seem to indicate this one is? ""10,000 B.C."" actually starts off promisingly, with a fairly exciting chase scene involving a bunch of underdressed homo sapiens pursuing a herd of overdressed woolly mammoths. Then, regrettably, the plot itself takes over, the umpteenth version of that oldie about the evildoers who come from over the mountains to ransack the peace-loving tribe's village and make off with some of their members. It is then up to the hunkiest guy in the group to mount a rescue attempt, braving threats both manmade and natural on the way to his goal.Because we have so little to engage our interest either intellectually or emotionally, our minds are free to ponder some of the truly profound questions of the ages such as how such primitive people, living out in the harshest elements imaginable, still manage to have their eyebrows neatly tweezed and their hands softly manicured at all times.There's not much point in discussing the dialogue or the acting - both largely irrelevant in a film of this type anyway - but it should be pointed out that while the mammoths are really quite impressive in their movements and appearance, the giant dodo birds and saber-toothed tigers with which our heroes also have to contend feel much more like the CGI effects that they clearly are.Who knows, but ""10,000 B.C."" may one day achieve the status of a camp classic - yet, the way I see it, there's nothing quite like a scantily-clad Raquel Welch being chased by an angry Tyrannosaurus Rex to up a movie's chances at achieving cinematic immortality.","10,000 BC"
27,Robert_duder,A visual spectacle with an unfortunate rating....another big disagreement on my part to the critics of the world,9,16 March 2008,"I must be easily impressed. I am convinced of it or maybe I just love movies too much although there are plenty that I hate. This movie is getting skewered by professional critics and IMDb critics alike and it really does make me second guess my judgment but I've never let the crowd tell me which way to go and I'm not going to start now. I had meager expectations of 10'000 BC, not really sure what to expect and I'm also a HUGE History buff and studied Sumerian religion and culture a lot in High School (yes Sumerian NOT Egyptians like everyone is calling them on here.) More than anything else 10'000 BC is a stunning, jaw dropping spectacle from the hunting of the Mammoths to the incredible pyramid building and battles. If there was ONE thing wrong with this film it was it's rating. I am all for a family film, and I'm not some nasty dude who wants blood, guts and gore in everything I see but this film needed adult content. You needed to see the battle, the ruggedness of their lives and the violence, much like Apocalypto but I do understand wanting to keep options open to make more money. I do believe that 10'000 BC was made not as a historical grand epic that would take home awards but to make money period and it will do that I believe. There is also some common place plot holes and weird little things that could be picked apart but just sit back and watch this spectacle and just enjoy it because I think it's a masterpiece in it's own right.The cast is adequate, I don't think anyone person really stuns or amazes but they are good in their respective roles. Relative newcomer Steven Strait plays the lead hero. A man who grew up believing his father abandoned his people but discovers he is destined to lead his own. He's good and watchable but doesn't light up the screen or anything and doesn't really command and huge presence on screen. Camilla Belle plays his love interest and she is stunning, she really is beautiful especially with those eyes (which are fake) but she really is nothing more than eye candy and a damsel in distress and I think she is or could be better than that. Character actor Cliff Curtis is the elder who longs to teach Strait's character and befriends him. His character could be a lot more important and in the forefront but he's kind of quiet and foreboding and loses a lot because of it. Same goes for Affif Ben Badra who plays a villain that is taken by the lovely Belle. I almost expected some sort of redemption for his character but it never happens, quite the opposite in fact. Oscar nominated veteran actor Omar Sharif is the narrator and they don't use him very much which is unfortunate.It seems like when it comes to the cast they underused a lot of potential exchanging it for visual effects but that works because the CGI is incredible. The saber-tooth tiger, the stunning Mammoths, the pyramids, the main villain or god at the Pyramids was as disturbing as ever. As for historical inaccuracy...I really don't think the film was trying for that BUT it's not as inaccurate as everyone is crying about. The villains in the film are NOT Egyptians, they are Sumerians which a lot of history is mostly legend and lore and I think they do an incredible job at covering that. They even make mention of the possibility of them being from Atlantis, and give a whole actual visual on them putting together the pyramids and the original face of the Sphinx (which looked awful and cartoony but still...) The film is about as PG as you can get, never showing any skin, using foul language or any brutal violence. The battle scenes are still very cool but you'll never see a close up of anyone dying so you can bring your tweens and up to see it which is good. A different spin on historical epic for everyone. Director Roland Emmerich who has done some really incredible stuff (Independence Day) and some very disappointing average stuff (Godzilla) has a real desire to do monstrous things with a budget and sometimes it will work and sometimes it won't. Don't chastise him for wanting to entertain us. He's a good director and you can see it in his style and desire to entertain. I say fight against the harsh critics because if this is the beginning of a summer blockbuster it's pretty incredible!! I loved it!! 9/10","10,000 BC"
28,MLDinTN,perhaps the most factually incorrect movie ever?,3,1 March 2009,"This movie was not good. I give it a 3 only because the special effects with the prehistoric animals were pretty good as well as some battle scenes. But this movie is supposed to be about prehistoric humans, whom by the way, speak perfect English, have white teeth, wear shoes,etc... A tribe is invaded by men on horses who take some of them to make slaves. D'leh is the hero. He along with 3 others follow them across snow covered mountains, a tropical forest???, and over a desert. Never mind the fact they are walking while the evil ones have horses. D'leh wants to save his love, Evolet, whom is coveted by one of her assailants. D'leh meets what seems like an African tribe, the Naku, whom he gathers their warriors to fight the evil ones. And I guess we are to assume they are Egpyticans since they are shown buildings pyramids in a desert. Forget the fact the Egyptians come much later than 10000 BC. They also had mammoths working for them, whom were extinct a long time before the Egyptians.D'leh also has an encounter with a sabertooth tiger. He sets the cat free. It's a good thing a tiger has a memory and knows which human set him free. Also, where did the giant dinosaur like birds come from. I thought this film went back to Jurrasic Park since they looked like raptors. Did D'leh trek all the way to South America and than back to Africa in a day? FINAL VERDICT: This film was not really good enough to be called a popcorn flick. Everything about it was silly.","10,000 BC"
29,g-bodyl,I thought this was great!,10,8 September 2008,"10,000 B.C is way better than the reviews said. This is not the accurate, Oscar-worthy movie, this is pure entertainment. 10000 BC is about a guy named D'Leh who lives in a nomadic tribe and he must rescue his girl who was kidnapped by slavers from far away. With the help of his fellow tribemates, new tribes he meets along the way, and luck D'Leh must save his girl, Evolet. As with most Roland Emmerich films, the special effects were amazing. The effects just kept you glued to the movie. The acting is not bad. The two main characters are played by relatively unknown actors. I will admit that the storyline is a bit cheesy especially at the beginning. As the movie goes on, the story/script gets better. The music is a good listen, too. This movie does not deserve any negative reviews. This is a nice action-packed epic. Who cares if this not appropriate for an A+ history paper, use an encyclopedia. I rate this movie a 10/10.","10,000 BC"
30,FiendishDramaturgy,"Not a Masterpiece, But Loads of Fun",8,14 March 2008,"As usual, I must say I'm in the minority with my critique, but I really enjoyed this one. My local hometown theater Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville, TN, actually experienced a decent turnout for a Monday matinée. We expected to be the only two in the audience. We were surprised.I can't say Roland Emmerich has found his way back to the beginning, because it is rather unclear what the beginning would consist of, but he HAS found his way back to favored and familiar ground. This ran, for me, like a secret prequel to Stargate. Honestly, the only thing lacking was a Stargate standing 3 mounds away in the distant background. For some, this may seem like a bad thing, but for me, it was delightful.While anthropologically ridiculous it IS a lot of fun, and the use of the word ""demon?"" That word wasn't invented for another 11,000 years. While I will not even try to point to any specific historical data to substantiate Emmerich's vision of woolly mammoths assisting in the building of the great pyramids, the Shakara texts (though written eight thousand years later) DO indicate the presence of ""great beasts of burden"" at that time. Not that I would attack or defend this element. I found it beautiful, whether accurate, or not. So regardless of the probability that one should not learn from this film, one can still derive some level of entertainment from it.But there are many elements here I found common with Stargate. Here are the ones that rise a bit above commonality, which is shared with many other movies.The cultures appear nearly identical between the boy in the mountains and the people the Stargate travelers found.Baku and the mentally challenged boy in Stargate obviously acted as the movie ""mascots."" The battle scenes had a stand off in front of the pyramid with guards between the hero(es) and the God.Sha'uri's brother's hair and that of the boy from the mountains (D'Leh) were done in nearly identical fashion.They both used children (Stargate) and a blinded child-like people (10KBC) as attendants of the God.There are more, but that's enough. I loved it. It had the look and feel of a wonderful period piece. It felt like a period romance, actually, though brutal in places, and downright gritty here and there. I was pleased overall. Although I was expecting more mammoth and saber-tooth scenes, I enjoyed it immensely.All in all? This is going to work hard to find its niche. The guys may not care for the smarmy romance elements and the girls may not care for the ""women as property"" elements, but truthfully, there is something there for most everyone. We really enjoyed it, and rate is as a B+ for Friday/Saturday night viewing.It rates an 8.3/10 from...the Fiend :.","10,000 BC"
31,thinker1691,""" Welcome to Palo-World """,9,30 June 2008,"The ability of our directors, actors and animators to enthrall us at the movies, has reached out and snared our hungry imagination with this latest high-tech offering. The Film ""10,000 B.C."" is to say the least, wildly entertaining. For the child within us, there are plenty of special effects which cause the hair to stand on edge. Within this film, we are given everything from a prehistoric love story, Saber-tooth tigers, Mastodons and something very unusual, 'the Roc.' For the average viewer, we have Cave-men and their mountain-top families, invading horsemen, nation building Egyptians, myth-creating Nubians and panoramic scenes to equal the ten commandments. True, there aren't notable Hollywood actors or actresses, (Except perhaps Omar Shariff) but those who were depicted, do a superb job. For the factual historian or film realist watching this film, we begin our criticism early, but are soon inundated with such spectacular and visual images, such as man-eating birds, pyramid-building woolly mammoth's, sympathetic Saber-tooth cats and celestial predictions, that we end up enjoying the Atlantian based tale. And so, despite the literal license, taken, the film has collected enough admiration from it's jubilant fans, to predict, it has earned a place in the Classic files. ****","10,000 BC"

The action scenes where good when they came up. And the CGI animals prove to more memorable then the characters in this film. Okay maybe last years 300 may used some creative license, but at the same time it tried to be historical, in my opinion 10,000 B.C. fails to do that. When the action scenes are not happening, it becomes a talkie type film, where at the point you feel like dozing off. Like I said Pathfider(2007) was more memorable then this.","10,000 BC"
33,generationofswine,An Honest Review,2,26 March 2017,"I work in history and 10,000 BC is about 5,000 years before my job really starts...still, there is a sort of Graham Hancock pseudoscience kind of fascination with the Stone Age...the Neolithic era if really want to get well...there are so many questions there that you sort of have to be interested in it...And then there is Emmerich and I really WANT to like him as a director. I mean, if you look at his body of work, they are all movies that should be really fun to watch. They all SHOULD be entertaining, even in the guilty pleasure sense and really, honestly, that is why I watch movies.It's just they hardly ever are even guilty pleasure entertaining.And 10,000 BC is no exception. It's not even the Gladiator ""well we got to see Rome on the big screen"" sort of worth it.You get one Mammoth that comes close to what you want to see and then it goes total Conan. Total Robert Howard kind of Hyborian Age.I don't know. Maybe I was expecting a sort of action pact over the top sort of Quest for Fire movie. Maybe that was wrong of me.You don't feel dirty walking out of it like you do with Bay films...but you don't feel entertained either.And by the time you start driving home you almost have forgotten that you've even seen it.","10,000 BC"
34,dfranzen70,"For historical accuracy, consult Captain Caveman instead",4,28 July 2008,"Although well shot in front of gorgeous vistas, on location in New Zealand, Namibia, and South Africa, 10,000 BC is just another loud, dumb, and eminently pointless CGI adventure from the tactless, talentless, hacky direction of Roland Emmerich.There’s a plot, believe it or not, something about the true love between some tribesman and a hot chick, set in the very distant past, and these rampaging marauders attack their peaceful prehistoric-era tribe and carry off the womenfolk, so our hero spends the next two hours of movie time trying to get her back.But who cares, right? No one in his right mind would watch a Roland Emmerich movie for the plot. The man brought us Godzilla, Independence Day, and The Day after Tomorrow, after all. No, your focus here is supposed to be on the prehistoric-ness of the thing, like the wild, carnivorous birds, or the mastodons, or the sabre-tooth tigers. Oh, and the smoldering hotness of lurve that Our Hero and His Love can barely contain.Your first clue that this won’t be much more than a silly bore is the simple fact that our noble hunters speak perfect, inflectionless English. No idea why. I’m not the biggest fan of subtitles, granted, but I think here they at least would have made sense. Instead, we have these perfectly coiffed young people with gleaming white teeth - as any prehistoric hunter would have - speaking the Queen’s English to each other. It’s bizarre and off-putting. These cool kids look like they fell out of a Gap commercial; they’d be dead in minutes if they actually had to fend for themselves on a tundra or in the jungle. They’re as believable as Ed Begley, Jr. at a biker rally. Which is not very believable.And it’s not as if they get clever, intelligent dialog to mouth. D’Leh (heh, sounds like Delay) tells a vicious, trapped sabre-tooth tiger, “Do not eat me when I set you free!” See, because he doesn’t want to be eaten, and he figures that reasoning with the beast will do the trick. D’Leh, played by newcomer Steven Strait, is sort of a poor man’s Colin Farrell, complete with otherworldly eyebrows. He wants you to think he’s earnest and sincere, but instead you think he’s vapid and vain. Crazy! (”Do not eat me when I set you free!” That’s hilarious right there. Why, it’s right up there with “Throw me the whip, and I’ll throw you the idol!”) Besides, this whole pursuing-the-savages-who-stole-our-people thing was done much better only a few years ago in Mel Gibson’s Apocalpyto. Now, you might not buy into the notion of using an ancient Mayan dialect in a movie, but at least it made some sense. Using that dialect, with subtitles, there was a real sense of adventure and tragedy; here, the fluid English feels woefully inept and completely anachronistic.Unlike Apocalypto, there’s scant fighting and mayhem here. The tribe (like that in Apocalypto) is a hunting tribe, so that explains why for much of the movie they run and hide and duck and cover. I will find you! What’s his name cries. And then he finds her and then loses her again, and he says, I’ll come back! And then he spends the next hour or so trying to find her. His One True Love is like a set of pretty car keys.Back to that tiger, which makes a couple of appearances. Now, I like CGI as much as the next guy. It can very easily enhance a scene, make the unrealistic seem obvious and believable. But this tiger reminded me of the cyclops and other fantastical creatures you’d see in those old fifties Greek-epic movies, the ones featuring the work of the great Ray Harryhausen - basically, essentially, stop-motion animation. And that looks crappy here in good ol’ 2008.10,000 BC isn’t meant to be a historical epic - the year 10,000 BC is used here merely to connote a Long Time Ago - which is fine in and of itself, but really isn’t anything compelling about it other than its setting. It’s predictable pap without much of a heart, instilling no compassion or feeling from its audience.","10,000 BC"
35,PWNYCNY,Great movie for a sci-fi flick.,5,31 March 2008,"Let's get real. This movie is not exactly one of the classics. No, it's not even worthy of an honorable mention. Acrually, I wonder if this movie is even worth critiquing. The movie is crammed with special effects which is just Hollywood's way of covering up a mediocre story and equally mediocre acting (though that has much more to do with the material than with the skill of the performers). When one considers the movies in the science fiction genre, certain movies set the standard foe excellence. King Kong, Alien, The Thing From Another Planet, Predator, The Day The Earth Stood Still, movies that have become icons. This movie does not meet that standard. It's flashy special effects cannot save it from its ultimate fate - oblivion to DVD land where all mediocre movies quickly go after an unsuccessful presence in movie houses. And let us reminder one thing, movies are meant to be shown on BIG screens, not TV screens.Don't believe the negatives reviews of this movie! This movie is great for sci-fi. It is definitely one of the better films of the sci-fi genre. As a matter of fact, this movie contains all the elements of a classic, with great acting, excellent script, and outstanding special effects. The movie is part Jurassic Park, part Lost World, part King Kong, part Indiana Jones, part Ten Commandments and part every other sci-fi movie about prehistoric times ever made. This movie deserves to be nominated for every award in the movie industry. Everything about this movie is crammed with entertainment. Wonderful movie. Masterful example of cinema verite. This movie is worthy of every accolade found in the English language.","10,000 BC"

37,dwpollar,Interesting pre-historic action movie...,6,13 January 2009,"1st watched 1/8/2009 (Dir-Roland Emmerich): Interesting pre-historic action movie combining humanoids from different cultures with large prehistoric-like animals of different varieties. This movie by Director Roland Emmerich is unique in that there are no known stars in it and it's decent entertainment without being overblown like much of Emmerich's movies. The story is about a tribe who are about to go hungry, but are supposed to be rescued from extinction by one boy. This revelation is revealed to the tribe thru a witch-doctor type woman who senses everything that the boy goes thru after revealing this. After taking care of the food shortage the group is then attacked by another group of humans who steal some of the members to be slaves. We later find out this group is using these slaves to build a pyramid. OK, so it is a little far-fetched that these cultures are clashing in this timeframe but the main theme of the story is about taking care of your own. The boy also loses his future wife to the slaves and therefore bringing them back alive has kind of a duel purpose for him. Along the way, they run across giant birds, saber tooth tigers and other large creatures just thrown in to make this movie fun. The main source, though, of the movie's appeal to me is the way the tribe works to regain the others and bring them back home. This and the well put together animation combined with the humans makes this movie work.","10,000 BC"

39,Samiam3,"Not terrible, but quite amateurish and occasionally aggravating",5,7 June 2010,"For every brain cell that a Roland Emmerich movie does not have, it makes an extra dollar from the masses. By those standards, 10, 000 bc (and all the others too) are lacking the hundred million brain cells which would allow Emmerich to rival (let's say) Jurassic Park or anything by James Cameron. This motion picture, is a rather clunky, sissy, and not very involving enterprise which has its moments, and may prove useful to anyone writing a paper about filmmaker's gone lazy. Otherwise, it feels like a waste of money. I think I'm being a tad generous to this film, but I try to keep an open mind with everything I see.The plotting, which is rubbish, feels like a mix of Ridley Scott's Legend (with Mammoths instead of Magic) and Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. What we get is a muddled mess of anthropology and prehistory. It feels like Roland Emmerich and his art department are toying around with ideas a bit too much for comfort. Everybody will find at least one problem they have with the film. There is a scene where our heroes are being chased by a trio of Phorusrhracids. These ten foot tall, bipedal killer parrots went extinct hundreds of thousands of years before the film's setting. It kind of reminds me of Dino in the Flintstones. Those were the days when the entertainment media could get away with mix matching prehistoric periods. This scene is actually one of the more subtle inaccuracies, and probably only one in twenty people is liable to catch it. Other problems are not so subtle. The movie's first error pops up about ten seconds in; a voice of god narration. Seriously, why was this needed? It is so cheesy to listen to, it is like reading 'little did he know' in a murder mystery. Also, I think Emmerich could have found a better voice over. Another matter worth bringing up is the middling effectiveness of the world Emmerich is trying to design.The visual effects crew must've fallen asleep during the CG rendering process. Actually the effects are not quite as terrible as I was led to believe, but when the Saber tooth opens its mouth...wow, does that look fake.If it is a prehistoric epic you want, try Quest for Fire or Clan of the Cave Bear.","10,000 BC"

Certainly there are the Weirdest errors here-they go from, say, the Alps to the Deepest jungle to the Sahara almost overnite, they crisscross vast stretches of terrain w/ nary a hiccup, even our friend the Great White Goddess on foot seems to make it thru okay while chained.Yes you can make for allowances like these-Hollywood's been doing it forever-but WOW. Your heroe's tribe seemed to have a token Asian in there, they met half of the Bantu/Zulu/Daikini tribes along the way, and the baddies-I don't think Roland E could decide if they would be Indian or Chinese or Arabs or what the hell.I thought Cliff Curtis was fine, considering he was playing Tonto in this, more or less. The girl reminded me of Carmen Electra, the hero was Mr. Bland, while the rest were your basic cardboard cut-outs. In pulpy movies like 10K BC, it's NOT nec. to flesh them out anymore than this.Oh and did you notice that the 'Great Mother' or whatever-was an Eskimo-? Those cavemen got around, didn't they-? I thought the F/X were good-the Mammoths esp. but some of the inserts of the City of the Gods etc kinda poo-poo. And the final battle there-really that was just TOO easy.Did anyone else get an Ice Age Vibe-Mammoth, Sabre Tooth, etc?

42,eric262003,"Awesome Visuals, But Lack of Quality Overall",5,20 July 2009,"When I entered the theater last year to see the film, ""10,000"" B.C., I has high hopes for a compelling prehistoric adventure. The concept looked promising, but the flaws are so staggering that it falls flat on nearly everything that's going for it. For those expecting a period piece with an accurate piece of prehistory will be sadly disappointed. It doesn't even come close it it at all. It feels more like one of those before Christian epic adventures with some assorted prehistoric animals thrown into the mix. What may be partial to blame was the last minute movie title change. It was originally supposed to have called ""2000 B.C. Princess Rescue From the Pharoah's Doom"", but because the title seemed convoluted and disjointed so they made a new title threw in some random prehistoric mammals and ""10,000 B.C."". We stupid moviegoers will never know what we covered up. At least that is what they lead us to believe. Of course we the audience are much smarter than that.That one was the main inaccuracy another one is that the tribe is mixed with a melting pot of various ethnicities. In reality, ethnic groups would evolve in different areas at different climates, not all bunched in at once. The two heroes are depicted like in a way that's just insulting and appalling. The acting was abysmal. The way they talked like cavemen trying to speak highly distinguished will make you want to pull the roots out of your hair and scream your guts. By right, it should have followed ""The Passion of the Christ"" and spoke in some tribal languages with subtitles following it. It would've been more coherent and less lop-sided than it already is. No offense to the legendary Omar Shariff, but your voice was not necessarily needed here. It would be better if the narration added something new instead of just rehashing every action you see on the screen. Like an announcer at a hockey game. Narration and play-by-play are two different things. We all love you Shariff, but you have been in far better films than this turkey. The CGI comes off quite remarkable as it's on the same level as ""Lord of the Rings"", but still falls flat as an artistic delight. The mammoths in one shot are impressive, and then in another shot, they're cheesy looking, especially in herds. The mammoth herd looks like the one mammoth in a bunch of angles to make look like a herd which to me is cheap. The saber-toothed tiger is a cool kitty, but it's ability to maneuver itself is too obviously animated to be believable. But he's only on a few scenes though so his glory never dries out.If everything else failed we can't go wrong with the costumes and make-up can we? Or can we? Yes here we can. The costumes looked recycled from ""Planet of the Apes"". The ""Old Mother"" apparel looks tubular, but everything else look like cheap cave man Halloween costumes. The makeup looks like the cast was getting facial treatments at a girls-night-out slumber party.Okay it was an awful movie, but did they attempted to at least wrap things up with a suitably compelling ending? Nope not this time. What it does have in it is that it can still be a worthy film to watch even with the tiresome ""save the girl"" story. Though it won't win any Oscars, but it won't make you want to leave your seat. Give it a shot, it's not good, but it'll try to feed off your boredom.","10,000 BC"

We're teased by several good scenes and some initial villains, but instead of building on this, the movie becomes rushed. It's like they've run out of budget or ideas and made the last 20 min in haste. Likewise, all the mumbo-jumbo about the cosmic hunter come to defeat the god-like Egyptian-type ruler didn't go over well - it was glossed over as an afterthought. The foreign en-slavers seemed like weak competition putting up nary a fight, in fact becoming defeated with little resistance. And most perplexing the original nomad villains were defeated as afterthoughts. The saber-tooth was cartoon-city, and hardly featured. There were a whole bunch of logic questions that I wont even delve into - how is English even around? And bilingual tribes as well....guess you'd have to suspend belief. Anyway,some of the earlier scenes were well put together, but there needed to be more to the overall pull of the story to make it work. This movie mostly misses it's mark. Stangely it reminded of Stargate but not as fun - double checked it - was made by the same director - he stole his material from an earlier better movie or his own!","10,000 BC"

Well, there are many, in fact. This one is no exception. In here, you have people speaking English and many more laughable things.However, coming to see this film, I knew the movie makers didn't care that this film was historically inaccurate. Do not come into this movie expecting some interesting facts about Mayan people or whatever the heck they are basing this movie on. They just want to entertain people. Unfortunately, the movie is also really boring.With really bad dialog, really bad performances, and some let down action scenes not typical from Roland Emmerich, 10,000 B.C. is a huge let down and disappointment. I'm also really disappointed by Steven Strait and Camilla Belle. I enjoyed ""The Covenant"" and ""When a Stranger Calls"" really much. This is is like 10 steps back for them.Sure, the visual effects are great, but the action scenes are disappointing and boring. If they don't have a good story and if they don't have good action, it's a bad movie. This seems like a rip-off from a lot of movies, including ""Apaocolypto,"" ""300,"" and ""Pathfinder.""

That is all that was good. I thought I would see some really inventive CGI (as I saw in the promos), but that was not to be. This is basically a love story. D'Leh's (Strait) love, Evolet (Belle), gets captured and he goes after her. Haven't we seen this before? Wait a minute. This was in 10,000 BC. So this was first. We have not seen this before. What was I thinking?(Hey, they did speak English) Yes, but only for a time and after that translators were needed. And, what language was that anyway? Did we really need to listen to gibberish posing as language? English would have been fine. We are an English speaking/listening audience, you know, and we are here to be entertained, and not here to figure out what language had its roots in 10,000 BC - doesn't make sense and sub titles don't either. We know these people speak another language. We get it. We can make allowances. We can assume the bad guys were early Egyptians building a pyramid and using Woolly Mammoths to haul the blocks. Did anyone ever think the pyramids were built that way? Hmmmmm Still a mystery.The acting was good by all. The cinematography was also good, but that was probably CGI. The CGI was also good regarding mammoths, reptilian birds, and yes, that long-toothed Saber Tiger. Seeing more of the Tiger would have been a good thing since the Tiger took a liking to D'Leh, who saved the Tiger from a trap. Yes, this needed more magic along those lines. The natives loved all of this. I did too. But truth be told, this movie, even though it took place in 10,000 BC, still reminded me of the last Rambo movie and Apocalypto. Not much new. Wait a minute, this was 10,000 BC. So this was first. What was I thinking?Regardless, I expected more.

A guy goes on a quest and meets a variety of prehistoric paraphernalia. He's an expert hunter predicted in the stars and by a priestess with weird eye expressions, and recruits vast armies of guys he never met before. Together they attack a city you always see in sweeping 360 degree type CGI views. It's some quasi-Egyptian place ruled by a veiled god. Both the god and his sidekick high priest are in dire need of a manicure. There are characters that run in and out, some of whom you will never know who they were.

48,dunmore_ego,Mammoth Mistake,1,22 November 2008,"Roland Emmerich's 10,000 B.C. is so authentic and realistic in its portrayal of primitive man, it is obvious he did all his research for the film by watching THE FLINTSTONES. I never knew a movie could annoy me from its first minute. It is 10,000 B.C. A camera pans down on a prehistoric village - and a ""narrator"" starts - not just any narrator - Omar Sharif, doing his best caveman James Mason.The appearance of the first discernible language has always been a contention, but I'm pretty sure the gutter whore language of English was not invented yet. Okay, maybe they're speaking in rudimentary grunts but the FILM is translating so that we won't need subtitles. I'll live with that - but the movie won't let up... In the village community hut, a tribal gathering (made up of so many colors and ethnicities it looks like a Benetton ad), where we realize: No Breasts. Not even a hint of side-tit. So PG-13 was invented in caveman times! It's all clear now - that's why the MPAA have the brains of Neanderthals. Suddenly - Uncle Bully. Cliff Curtis: Maori badass B-Actor, one of the tribal elders, name of Tic Tic (because they haven't invented the word ""tac"" or ""toe"" yet). It's 10,000 B.C. - for the love of the earth god, use ""unknowns""! (And appearing in this movie guarantees they'll stay unknown - so it all works out.) Into this gathering is thrust a young white girl with blue eyes (blue eyes not yet in the human gene pool - but that doesn't stop the film), regarded as a prophecy/curse, and wailed over by an old woman elder. Everyone argues over the blue-eyed chick and we realize that not only is everyone speaking English, but in those provincial times when tribes were closeknit communities, they should all be speaking with the same inflection - yet they all speak in different accents, as if this village is some cosmopolitan travelers' haven, all of them using modern American vernacular that would make a Geico caveman proud.Five minutes in and my annoyance meter is red-lining.A fight breaks out among the white American boys - no, don't be silly, they don't fight like the savage beasts they would be emulating, they've evolved PAST the fisticuffs stage straight to Ali vs. Frazier. So the blue-eyed chick and the hero boy grow up, looking like they've just come off the latest Giorgio Armani runway with their aquiline noses and pale skin that looks like it's never soaked up a shaft of sunshine let alone been raised on the wild plains. To further annoy us, their names are straight out of a French Romance novel of the 1800's - Evolet and D'Leh. Yes, there's an APOSTROPHE in the guy's name - English isn't invented yet, but they've got the audacity to use an APOSTROPHE!By now, I've thrown so much good china at the screen I've got to order takeout just for the containers. Never before have I welcomed the arrival of special effects - Mammoth party time! But Emmerich and his visual effects team have a surprise up their sleeve for us, as all the shirtless white hunters join the hunt by running on a treadmill in front of a rear projection, chroma-keyed onto a landscape. You heard me: the same way they made George Reeves ""fly"" in the black-and-white SUPERMAN television series - that's what this movie uses in 2008 to ""make-believe"" these Geico dudes are on the plains of ancient Africa somewhere. That's how much Roland Emmerich wants to insult us.The plot is as asinine, cookie-cutter and stupid as the rest of every single second of this movie. A barbarian tribe from The Bronze Age (how else do we account for their steel manacles and locks when our hero dopes still can't master wooden spears yet?) kidnaps the blue-eyed chick, and French Flintstone (with Uncle Bully) follows their trail over mountains and mountains and more mountains - and then treks across mountains (did I mention he walks across mountains?) to find her. On a studio set dressed with fake snow, Uncle Bully somehow has the temerity to try to pull of an Oscar Death Scene. (""Oscar Death Scene"" denoted by taking all of ten minutes to fall down and die after being fatally stabbed, giving your own eulogy and a five-minute monologue). On their way, they encounter other tribes - actual BLACK African TRIBES, mind you - who join their quest to walk to the ends of the Earth, which is about ten miles across some sand dunes. Note that not even amongst these African tribes do we see one flash of woman-breast. National Geographic not invented yet.Even the premier CGI effect of this movie  the saber-toothed tiger - is about as exciting as watching a computer program rendering a saber-toothed tiger. Thanks for the three minutes screen time, Roland - I'll get my computer animal fix from WALKING WITH DINOSAURS, spank you very much.At the ends of the Earth, they discover a technological race busy building PYRAMIDS! It's STARGATE meets ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. - but even Raquel Welch's scanty animal-skin bra and panties revealed more in 1966 than any of these presumably hairy-backed ape-women here.Due to the thorough research and authenticity invested in this film, it is history in the making, as we actually watch the invention of: Amway Pyramid Schemes, the Slow Clap, ""Dressing up Like a Lady"" (invented by the head barbarian, later called Transvestitism or Elton John), the constellation Orion, bondage and discipline, the English Language, the Implausibly Ludicrous Romantic Happy Ending.","10,000 BC"

50,TheUnknown837-1,not enough pop and too much corn in this popcorn movie,5,17 November 2009,"I remember when I first saw the previews for ""10,000 BC"" sometime before its release and my first impression was, judging by its title and the fact that Roland Emmerich was attached as the director, that it was some kind of a reinvention of the cult classic ""One Million Years B.C."" a film that deliberately strayed away from historical accuracy in favor of lighthearted fantasy. ""10,000 BC"" takes the same approach, only there's no dinosaurs and no Raquel Welch, and in terms of intelligence and accuracy, it makes ""One Million Years B.C."" look like a history book by comparison. It also makes the said film—a guilty pleasure entertainment—look like a first-class piece of art.""10,000 BC"" stars Steven Strait as a mammoth-hunter living in a world where everything had dreadlocks, including the giant pachyderms he hunted. He's in love with another tribe member (Camilla Belle) who has the most delicately trimmed eyebrows, straightest teeth, and waxed legs and who apparently invented eyeliner as well. Anyway, there's some nonsense about a prophecy, which, guess what, comes true. Belle is kidnapped and taken away by men on horseback and it's up Strait and some companions to rescue her.The number of historical inaccuracies in this production is so vast that I could fill up my entire review with them, but I won't linger on that except for a few details. I can ignore the inaccuracies with ease; it's the bombastically bad dialogue and the hammy acting that I cannot stand in ""10,000 BC."" Because it works well visually, this is a film that might have worked maybe in the sort of way like ""Fantasia"", using visuals and no dialogue. But the problem here is that the movie not only contains awful dialogue, but it's simply packed with awful dialogue that either makes us roll or eyes or crack with laughter, neither of which was intended. My favorite moment is where Strait persuades a saber-toothed tiger he rescued from attacking a village, the village headman watches the tiger leave, walks up to Strait and right off the bat says: ""You speak to the spear-tooth?"" And there's also Omar Sharif's narration. Sharif gives a noble effort, but the fact is that not only is the narration dialogue terrible, but it's unnecessary and sometimes even gives away parts of the story.As a result, the laughable acting and the horrendously bad dialogue proves to be the downfall of ""10,000 BC"", and thus the movie really drags down. Now it does have some positive points. Visually, it's impressive. It doesn't break any new grounds, but there are some good-looking moments. There's lots of spectacle landscape shots, and of course, an array of prehistoric animals such as mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and ten-foot-tall terror birds, although the latter are animated to look more like over-sized chickens than the vicious predators that they really were.There are parts to this movie that I did enjoy. I liked the attack by the giant birds, and some of the battle scenes, but in between and around all of that was some of the worst dialogue my poor ears have ever had the misfortune to hear, the movie dulls out due to too much of this, and in the end, I have to consider ""10,000 BC"" a failure. Now Roland Emmerich has made pretty much nothing but popcorn movies and some of them, such as ""Independence Day"" have been very good. This is another popcorn movie and it's not very good. Frankly because it just has very little pop and too much corn.","10,000 BC"
51,Andy-296,Ridiculous but entertaining,8,6 April 2008,"A ridiculous but pleasantly entertaining prehistoric epic by the director of ""Independence Day"". Set in 10,000 BC, it starts showing a tribe sporting Rastafarian dreadlocks as they hunt down woolly mammoths. After one of the warriors called D'Leh kills one beast all by himself, he gains as a trophy the hand of Evolet, the beauty of the tribe (played by Camilla Belle, a Lindsay Lohan look alike). But before D'Leh can enjoys his prize, a group of slave raiders attacks the tribe during dawn, and takes Evolet as captive. D'Leh along with some other tribesmen decides to track the raiders in order to free Evolet. In alliance with other tribes, they pursue the slave traffickers down to their home, a civilization building pyramids and ruled by an androgynous ruler that seems inspired by Ancient Egypt. The movie is full of inaccuracies, both historical and geographical (to name just a few, there were no domesticated horses in 10,000 BC, much less pyramids; at the start of the movie, the action seems to be happening in Northern Eurasia, but our heroes find themselves soon in Africa) but that's not the point, but to enjoy a good popcorn movie. Not quite as good as Apocalypto (which was its obvious model) but enjoyable nonetheless.","10,000 BC"
52,MrGKB,Classic BSM film-making to the Nth degree...,4,11 November 2008,"...which is to say, I really don't want to waste any more words on this Roland ""Independence Day"" Emmerich mega-bomb than I absolutely have to. Beautifully shot by Emmerich regular, Ueli ""The Jerky Boys"" Steiger, with fine production values (including mostly well done CGI), ""10,000 B.C."" otherwise suffers from the bane of BSM's everywhere: a horrendously awful script, predominantly phone-it-in acting, and the dramatic impetus of an out-of-control semi careening down a long, lonesome highway. In a word (or two): utter crap. Thank goodness I had a book to read while ""watching"" this polished bolus of a film. And thank goodness I found it at the library, though I do somewhat regret the measure of gasoline wasted bringing it home.""10,000 B.C."" is basically ""Quest For Fire"" for the brain-dead, chock full of egregious cultural and technological anachronisms, with an unlikely love story substituting for a true quest. There's no poster girl in a fur bikini, but fans of bad movies will have a field day noting all the scientific errors. Emmerich is noted for helming LCD movies, but I think ""10,000 B.C."" is his most heinous offender yet. Strictly for fans of Steven ""The Covenant"" Strait and/or Camilla ""The Quiet"" Belle, even their most ardent admirers will have a hard time sitting through this unmemorable time-waster. You've been warned. I gave it a ""4"" only on the basis of its visuals; on every other level, it's a complete failure.","10,000 BC"
53,Beta_Gallinger,Kind of hard to believe it's less than two hours long,4,5 December 2008,"This very recent epic, released just this year and set in a prehistoric time, certainly hasn't been the most well received in its genre. I've hardly seen any films on the big screen this year at all, and ""10,000 BC"" was no exception. I just rented it this week, without having seen much else from Roland Emmerich. I saw ""The Patriot"" a little over two months ago, but wasn't too impressed, and saw a bit of ""Independence Day"" some time in the late 90's, but can't remember it well enough to judge it. As for this film, I'm afraid I'm going to have to join the many nay-sayers on this one.The Yagahl tribe live on a mountain range and survive by hunting mammoths. A girl named Evolet with unusual blue eyes is adopted by this tribe, and the Old Mother, the wise old woman of the tribe, tells the others of a prophecy brought by the girl. Evolet and a hunter named D'Leh grow up together, and D'Leh finds himself in love. After a mammoth is killed near him, he wins the White Spear for killing it, and takes his prize, determined to win Evolet in marriage. However, he is tormented by the fact that he didn't actually kill the mammoth, and comes clean. Soon, another tribe comes and kidnaps Evolet, along with others, and D'Leh must lead a small group of hunters to pursue those invaders and rescue Evolet! On their way, survival is a challenge as they face dangerous creatures! It's clear that this movie is widely bashed for its inaccuracies and absurdities, and I can't argue with this (though I'm not too concerned about inaccuracies). The best example of an absurdity I can think of is where D'Leh sees a saber-toothed tiger who is trapped and says to it, ""Do not eat me when I set you free,"" or something like that! He actually manages to convince the vicious tiger not to eat him by talking to it! This movie is apparently supposed to be a realistic prehistoric epic, but at times, it seems much more like a fantasy (that saber-toothed tiger part being a perfect example), and that's not all. There are bigger problems with the film than the absurdities. ""10,000 BC"" almost always (if not always) failed to grab me with the action, and I guess I just didn't care much for the story, either. I'm sure it was supposed to be touching towards the end, but did not leave me with any strong feelings. The movie simply bored me when I watched it, and looking back afterwards, it still means basically nothing to me.Although I haven't seen most of Roland Emmerich's movies, I can tell he's not highly regarded as an amazing filmmaker. He clearly has made films more popular than this most recently released effort of his, but it appears he's never done any films that are hailed as absolute classics. Since I haven't seen too many of them, I guess can't judge his film-making skills as well as many others can, but from what I've read about him, it appears he's not a film-making genius. ""The Patriot"" and ""10,000 BC"" haven't convinced me to avoid Emmerich's movies like the plague from now on, but neither of them left me satisfied(especially this one), and if the sort of things in this film are common for Emmerich, then I can see why he has so many critics. If you want a good film about prehistoric humans, you should probably look elsewhere.","10,000 BC"
54,vip_ebriega,APOCALYPTO with cavemen and a huge slice of mammoth cheese.,4,24 January 2010,"My Take: Despite some enjoyable special effects, this is a rather unspectacular adventure that takes itself too seriously.I've seen 10,000 B.C. several times on TV, but not because I thought it was a great brainless yet enjoyable adventure, but because I usually fell asleep during the midsection and wanted to catch up on what I missed, and for a movie that gambles with a premise that might not work (a ""caveman epic"" doesn't really spell big bucks in the B.O.) that's not a good sign. Writer/director Roland Emmerich doesn't exactly have a talent for writing convincing characters or directing good actors, but he redeems himself by making some ludicrously enjoyable set pieces and excitement, which sadly what his 2008 caveman epic lacks.Emmerich, who directed INDEPENDENCE DAY and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, has created arguably his most disappointing effort since 1998's GODZILLA, committing almost exactly the same mistake. Once you get past the guilty pleasure of seeing a herd of stampeding Mammoths or chases with giant man-eating ostriches (more on that later), 10,000 B.C. lacks the very crucial ingredient: thrills. Instead of a ludicrously enjoyable ride with some tongue-in-cheek moments and campy self-awareness, 10,000 B.C. takes itself too seriously with its story of the ""first hero"" D'Leh (Steven Strait), who braves the odds to rescue his beloved Evolet (Camilla Belle), who is probably the most beautiful of her kind since she has discovered eye-liner(!), from the ""four-legged demons"" who have abducted her, along with other members of his tribe. The odds being a flock of deadly giant ""terror birds"", stampeding mammoths, a saber-toothed tiger (which, sadly, isn't put to good use here) and quite possibly the lamest villains in history. With a cheesy narration offered by Omar Shariff, this movie just calls for some good old-fashioned kitsch! Admittedly, Emmerich can still spin some enjoyable guilty pleasure along the way, including the aforementioned ""terror birds"" sequence which, despite being a bit goofy, is actually rather enjoyable. But so many other parts fall flat since they play it all with a straight face. A little humor would have been good. For a film that could have been a good afternoon spent of brainless fun, it's mostly just a bone-headed epic-wannabe with some long plodding scenes that slow down the movie and prevents it from become exciting. Plus, the heroes and the villains of the story are just plain boring! How can the story of ""the first hero"" be so important if it just ain't thrilling? Considering that my expectations were pretty low for 10,000 B.C. (due to some really bad reviews), it did often go beyond my expectations thanks to some good special effects (no matter how hokey that sabertooth was, they were pretty good). But expecting an occasionally entertaining no-brainer, it's a quite a letdown. Ugh!Rating: ** out of 5.","10,000 BC"
55,SanteeFats,Okay,5,24 February 2013,"An okay movie considering. It is entertaining at least. The tribal language seems very well developed for such an ancient time. Horse back riding did not occur before 6000BC and probably not until around 4500 BC. Bows were invented much later than 10000 BC. Don't get me started about the bolas. At least the giant predatory birds actually have a basis in history and of course the sabertooth. So a lot of the weapons displayed by the riders were actually not in use until much later in history. Of course Camilla Belle sure doesn't hurt the eyes,even dirtied up and in skins. It sure is convenient that the tribe the hunters run into just happen to speak their tongue and could send out messengers to gather other tribal warriors.","10,000 BC"

I have seen a lot of films, though...The creature FX sound good on paper, in reality, they're not even up there with Spielberg's Jurassic Park - and that was 20 years previous, a lifetime in the world of CGI.

57,fwomp,Lust-In-The-Prehistoric-Dust Meets Cro-Magnon-With-A-Conscious,2,6 December 2008,"Okay, I think it's official: director Roland Emmerich has finally hit rock-bottom. After the highly successful STARGATE, it seemed Emmerich could do no wrong. But then came INDEPENDENCE DAY. Not horrible but certainly not up to anything approaching Stargate quality. Then the remake, GODZILLA. Okay. We could live with it. Perhaps a notch below Independence Day. Then came THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. Oh boy. We'd slipped into some ruinous territory. Bad acting. Bad story. Laughable CGI wolves. And an ending that was putrid in both the film sense and science.But I sucked it up and decided to give Roland another shot. I'd seen some extremely cool reviews of 10,000 BC prior to deciding on this course. But I'd seen bad reviews of movies I'd turned out to love, too. Alright, Roland, this was it. I slipped the Blu-Ray disc in and braced myself...Yikes! What the...! Was this supposed to be some sort of joke? I mean, I don't mind suspending disbelief when I watch a piece of fiction, but let's try and make it at least watchable! What was so bad, you might ask? First is you'd have to believe that prehistoric man could build temples, navigate rivers and maybe even oceans, smelt metals (come on!), and then come home and talk romantically to the love of his life. Gimme a break! Steven Strait (SKY HIGH) was given the unfortunate lead role as D'Leh, a hunter-gatherer turned warrior after the woman he loves (and will marry?) is kidnapped from his village by slave traders. D'Leh sets out to get his blue-eyed Evolet (Camilla Belle) back. He and a smattering of soon-to-be-warriors strike out across unknown territory, battling sabertooth Tigers, deadly horseback riders (???), dinosaurs (????) and D'Leh's feelings of inadequacy because of his father's abandonment of him years before (Oh yes, it's THAT bad).Okay, I do have to admit that the CGI/Blu-Ray transfer was nice. Particularly the representation of the Wooly Mammoths and the Sabertooth Tiger came across decent if over-the-top (the Sabertooth looked a tad bigger than I imagine they were).But this movie stunk; it was lust-in-the-prehistoric-dust meets cro-Magnon-with-a-conscious. Completely ridiculous and unreal. Mr. Emmerich, you've lost me.","10,000 BC"
58,cchase,Blame It On 'Evolet'...,5,4 July 2008,"Okay, I know from cheesy prehistoric caveman/woman movies. I was a big fan of the cheddar wheels known as ONE MILLION B.C. (starring Raquel Welch in her leopard- skin bikini) and WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH, (starring Victoria Vetri in HER leopard-skin bikini), both which were about as real as the nacho topping they use at Chi Chi's. So when I first caught the previews to 10,000 B.C., I was thinking that it would be just as ridiculous but also just as fun, with CGI effects that were light-years ahead of Ray Harryhausen's clunky-but-still- endearing stop-motion effects work. Well, I was half-right. The woolly mammoth stampede scenes and much of the fill-in work for the scenery is breathtaking. And I was fully willing and able to suspend my disbelief, buckle down and just enjoy the ride. But with apologies to Mr. Emmerich, I am not capable of the kind of suspension this movie calls for - which is about the height of the Eiffel Tower. And what really rendered me unable to do more but giggle at how hopelessly inane the movie was going to be, happened the first moment I saw the little girl who plays the younger version of Camille Belle's character, Evolet. The ""young"" Evolet had a complexion so even, beautiful and creamy, I could only think ""Gee! How great was it that cavewomen and their daughters had access to Max Factor back then?""It all just went downhill from there. The perfect dreads that the lead tribe wore were bad enough, but then here comes Steven Strait as Our Hero, D'Leh, sporting what had to be DaVinci veneers on his perfect teeth and a body by Bowflex. If the late Mario Puzo had rewritten this lousy script into a prehistoric masterpiece, the sight of D'Leh's Crest-worthy smile and perfectly sculpted abs would've STILL brought the whole thing crashing down like a house of cards in a wind tunnel.And then the whole thing with the saber-toothed tiger? PLEASE don't get me started...Do yourself a favor, people. DON'T be fooled by the great-looking previews or the box-cover art. Go find QUEST FOR FIRE or even CAVEMAN with Ringo Starr. You can do much better with either one. Even if you've seen both of them two dozen times before.","10,000 BC"
59,ja_kitty_71,A thrilling and exciting prehistoric film,10,15 July 2008,"As I said many,many times, I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I would see on the web, I thought this film was awesome! Who would of thought the prehistoric era can be thrilling and exciting (also films about it). I also love the ethnic drums and vocalizations in the soundtrack.The film starts in a remote central Eurasian mountain range, home to a tribe of hunter-gatherers called the Yaghal, who survive by trapping and killing mammoths. Here, the young hunter D'Leh who had found his heart's desire in the beautiful named Evolet....I like the sound of that name. When another band of mysterious horse-riding warlords raid the Yaghal camp and kidnapped Evolet (along with many others from the village), D'Leh is forced to lead a small group of hunters south to pursue the warlords to the end of their known world to save her. Driven by destiny, the unlikely band of rescuing warriors must battle terror birds in the Levant, and D'Leh saved a saber-toothed cat from a hunter's pit. Along their journey they meet other tribes of warriors, who have also had loved ones kidnapped by the marauding horsemen. Together they form a coalition and march in pursuit of the captors. At their heroic journey's end through a vast desert, they discover a mysterious civilization ruled by a enigmatic god-like figure (known as the Almighty) who is said to be the last survivor of his kind. Their ultimate fate lies in a city of slaves who toil to serve a being regarded as a living god, the Almighty, who has ordered the construction of three colossal pyramids. D'Leh manages to rally them together and the slaves join him and his army who have infiltrated the city in a revolt against the Almighty.Overall, I love this film. My dad loves it too.","10,000 BC"

61,jdkraus,"Despite all its flaws, I enjoyed the movie",5,26 March 2008,"From the reviews I've read about this movie, it sounded like the worst big budget movie ever made. Now that I've seen it, I can understand why people would say it was so terrible. I will admit 10,000 B.C. is not the best movie ever made for the following reasons: 1. The good guys speak English. I have no problem with that, but when the villains speak another language (which is often made up of grunts and shrieks) to those who speak English, they act like they understand them.2. Many characters have pearly white teeth. I thought dentists weren't around back then? 3. Almost everyone has long dreadlocks. I had the assumption that people long ago could care less about their hairstyle, unless of course they were of royalty.4. The movie does not explain any history to as what tribe the good guys represent and what the bad guys represent. The Babylonians? The Assyrians? Egyptians? No basis of history.5. There are a bunch of prophecies and legends from the tribes that are quickly introduced, into the film, that aren't developed or elaborated. They seem to be thrown in by the screenwriters at the last minute.6. When there comes CGI there is great action sequences. They were very entertaining, but they lacked the suspense that King Kong or even The Lord of the Rings had.7. Omar Sharif is a great actor, but not a great narrator. Rather than speaking distinctively, he mumbles throughout the film.8. With the cast, everyone sounds rehearsed. The actors don't express a whole lot of emotion in the film, making me not care for them. Even the villains are bland.Despite all of those flaws, I actually enjoyed the film. The costume design and set-decoration was wonderfully mastered. I felt like I was seeing a nice Hollywood depiction of what civilization may have looked like thousands of years ago. This movie also has some wonderful CGI. The mammoths look real, so real that I almost would want to reach out and touch their fur. I was also mildly interested in the typical ""saving the damsel in distress and freeing the people part"" of the little solid story it had.To sum this film up, it is a big budget film that probably most people will forget over the next month like many people did with Alexander. 5/10","10,000 BC"

Literally the only positives was that some action scenes were ok and the CGI was really good in places, which is to be expected with a £80,000,000 budget.1/10: I cannot believe how bad this film is, I don't know how anyone can like a second of this but I certainly feel worse that I found it impossible to enjoy any of it","10,000 BC"
63,raymond-15,Extensive credits give some idea of the work involved in this imaginative tale.,7,29 December 2008,"What a task it must have been to write about events which might have taken place so long ago. Personally I would not know where to start. While not original, a love story might add a little interest to a series of exciting events. Such is the case here.The writers borrow ideas from the old Testament (the tribe in question is waiting for a messiah who will lead them to peace and victory over their wild neighbours) as well as from George Bernard Shaw's ""Androcles and the Lion"" (Androcles removes a thorn from a lion's paw and the lion remembers his kind action). There are other ideas used many of which we have seen before in other films.I think most of the reviewers have been too critical of this film. Forget anachronisms, I say. Just relax and enjoy the expansive sets, huge casts and non-stop action. Let your imagination take over. It's just an exercise in what might have been.Steven Strait is a bit of a charmer in the leading role of the young man who saves his tribe. Unafraid of the gigantic mammoths and huge cats, he well deserves the white spear for his bravery. But high marks go first to the film's director who had some mighty big tasks in putting all those wild tribes into believable situations such as fighting the mammoths or building the pyramids.I was sorry his girl friend got a nasty spear through her body, but I'm not telling what happened after that except that the tribe had a Wise Mother who seemed to know the answers to all life's problems.One of the criticisms not mentioned by others was the fact that I felt the costuming was a little too modern. The climatic changes were a bit puzzling with flooding rains and snow storms and sandy deserts. A huge problem for the wardrobe designers, I would think. Scenes of the slaves building the pyramids would be more effective if they were lashed with whips on their half-naked bodies. I think generally speaking all characters should have worn less clothes and clothes that had been roughly put together considering 10000 BC is a mighty long time ago.","10,000 BC"
64,bopdog,"Good idea, poorly executed, ripping off better films. Overall: boring and BAD",2,8 March 2008,"I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1, because of the sabre-toothed tiger. I liked the big cat.Sometimes when a movie fails, one can say ""All the elements of a good film are present here. But taken together, they don't add up to much."" This film goes a step further down the ladder, as it were. This elements are there in name only. As if a committee of some sort wrote a draft of an outline for a movie, but then failed to make even one of the elements worthy of being filmed.Sometimes a failed film is loathsome. There is something about the spirit of it that makes one angry, or creeped out. Not here--- this is just a good, old fashioned bad movie. It was so amateurishly conceived and executed... well, I could go on, but that would be unkind.Instead, let me simply say it was BAD. Even the makeup was awful. These neo-cave-people were supposed to be dirty, one supposes. But did they all wear really obvious wigs? And really bad beards? Not since the truly loathsome ""Gettysburg"" has a movie's character paraded around in such god-awful fake hair/beards.This spoiler alert is really redundant. The movie was already spoilt. However, to be fair, to mention the last 1/4 or so of the tedious film, I had no problem with them depicting the pyramids being built 6,000 earlier than typically, archaeologists claim (i.e., 10,000 b.c. instead of 2,500 b.c.). Who knows the truth? They may well have been. But the Tibetan looking masters appeared as a direct rip-off of the team of space invader types depicted in ""Star Gate,"" an underrated and very good film.Finally, as with many movies since 1900--- the white people were the heroes. However the cave people came to WALK from the Alps to the Sahara (which wasn't a desert then) and the Nile River, in their words, ""some days"" and step virtually from deep snow to endless sand in a single cut, and then back and forth (???) the darker skinned slaves and tribes-people were lead and saved by the white guy, and his white girl friend. I wasn't offended, just mystified. They placed a ""Rasta"" wig on them, but they were clearly white, and most of the others were either black, or some darker complected ethnicity, such as perhaps Semites or Medeterreanean peoples. For 1955, one would expect it. For 2008, one thinks--- ""Hmmm. Silly art direction, silly writing, silly direction, bad movie.""","10,000 BC"

The seer of the village predicts that all Hell will break loose during the next migration and sure enough, when the beasts come they bring company and this new company isn't entirely pleasant. And so the adventure begins.When I saw the trailers for this film I was thinking about a fantasy story and I kept on thinking that when I entered the cinema. Turns out the thought was right. This -is- a fantasy story, and it happens to use a tiny and heavily distorted fraction of Earth's history as a backing story. It brings this fantasy tale with a huge amount of eye candy. In fact, it is all eye candy. This wouldn't be entirely bad if it weren't for the fact that in this way it puts so little energy in keeping the story straight that it runs aground pretty quickly.It is amusing at points though. But only if you manage to put your brain of the hook for a while and watch it as a fantasy film - not as an accurate re-telling of history.5 out of 10 rampaging barbarians","10,000 BC"
66,phenomynouss,"Not great, but imaginative",7,9 March 2008,"Coming off some rather poor reviews, I expected failure from this movie, and the first ten minutes delivered all the fail I anticipated. After that, it drastically improved, and while it didn't succeed as an epic, it was very lively and highly imaginative.Starting with the bad, most of the dialogue just plain sucks. It's great that they tried to make the people sound simple, being this is 10,000 BC, but the kids (D'leh and Evolet) had these really painfully Arab-esquire accents and awkward dialogue reminiscent of Attack of the Clones Padme and Anakin. The dumb little kid who follows the hunters also is an embarrassing addition, but thankfully his dialogue is limited.The minor characters, such as the English-speaking African chief, are the only characters who really shine with their simplistic dialogue, and even D'leh sometimes narrowly misses having his lines crumble to sheer stupidity.Also a major detractment is the narrator, who is mostly completely un-needed save to further some events. Other times, we really don't need to hear him, such as the very end when the Old Mother supposedly 'breathes life' into Evolet. The images showed this clearly enough without needless narration.In the beginning, the special effects are rather poor, as you can very clearly see that a character doesn't fit in the background environment, as if they were filmed in front of a green screen, and then attempts at digitally removing the green glare only smeared the picture.Also, it was clearly not necessary to have the ice people of D'leh speak English, as they are the only English-speaking tribe in the movie, and it would have far better served the atmosphere to have them speaking a more primitive language, with more hand and facial gestures than verbosity.The action sequences, costumes, cinematography, and sets were spectacular, and managed to tell the greater story (oppressed tribes banding together to overthrow a tyrant) in a way that far supersedes the main individual story of D'leh trying to save Evolet, though from the prophetic viewpoint, it was interesting how they twisted the two together, having it be that only D'leh's desire to save Evolet could make him lead the tribes to freedom. To sum, the movie succeeds in macro-storytelling, but fails in micro-storytelling.As for the historical accuracy... it's very imaginative. And it requires you to use your imagination to explain certain things.For one, the pyramids in what is clearly Egypt. I thought it was a great explanation to show them using Mammoths to pull their limestone (since even today historians are marveled at how they could have pulled such stones with manpower alone), and though the first pyramids were built some 7,000 years after this movie takes place, the movie makes sure that it is left open to interpretation.What? The pyramids are barely half-way completed in the movie, and the slaves and tribes revolt against their ruler (a tall, godlike figure who must maintain his illusion of divinity to a point of never being seen; his personal slaves are all blind), leaving the pyramids incomplete. You could easily imagine that the pyramids could left incomplete for thousands of years, before a civilization known to us as the Egyptians of hieroglyphs and mummies worked to complete them. Sands could have eroded the pyramids, covering them up completely, or who knows? The movie doesn't definitively say the pyramids were built in 10,000 BC: only that they were begun, and presumably not completed by the original builders.In all, it's a beautifully done movie, which suffers from poor micro-storytelling. If the total story were in the forefront, and the love story reduced to a subplot, I think it would have been a far better movie.","10,000 BC"

The main bad guy looks at times like an alien and others just an old man, but claims to be a God and is forcing people to build him pyramids... There's just nothing here, not much action, no sense of humor whatsoever, dialogue stiff enough to insulate with, awful special effects (which is really about all this movie had going for it in the first place) and as much in common with the time period from which it gets in title as it does to ""12 Monkeys"" or ""27 Dresses"", cus they've all got numbers and letters too.

69,Al_The_Strange,10000 BC review,6,7 August 2013,"Going way back in time - long before the rise of civilizations, long before the bronze age, and long before ancient history as we know it - this film brings to life a prehistoric world of rampaging wooly mammoths, wicked saber-tooth tigers, giant birds, and warring native tribes. It is a brisky-paced, visually fantastic epic with plenty of action and peril.At the same time, it is pretty much more of the same. But while common sword-and-sandal epics like Centurion, The Pathfinder, and the various Conan movies make the effort to be grim and bloody, 10,000 BC takes the silly, cheesy, popcorn-movie path. It's a formula that Roland Emmerich works with very well, but it's not a particularly good formula for this genre. Most of the dialogue in 10,000 BC is pretty bad, a lot of scenes are incredulous (some are even laughable), and the film overall just looks too slick for its own good.This story covers pretty standard epic-movie ground. It's actually the same type of story as Apocalypto; both movies involve a tribe being subjugated by a superior race and marched to a more advanced city as slaves. But while Apocalypto was purposefully violent, grim, and authentic-looking, 10,000 BC is the exact opposite; it's bloodless PG-13 fare, with colorful scenery and formulaic heroes and villains. Characters don't really stand out at all, even though the film does its best to invoke themes of destiny and heroism. In the end, there's nothing much enlightening to this film; it's strictly a light and shallow adventure.This film employs some good, solid photography and editing. As for most everything else, I can't help but to shake the feeling that this is 21st century people in 21st century make-up and clothes in 21st century sets with 21st century special effects and 21st century props, trying so hard to replicate a prehistoric look and style. Despite all the neat-looking designs, every set, prop, costume, and special effect just looks so clean and slick that it never really looks right; the effect overall is like seeing a museum diorama brought to life. This even extends to the acting and writing; everybody does their best to sound and act like natives, but the dialogue is so simple and modern that it never really works, and the performances are pretty iffy. On the plus side, the music is alright.I wonder if 10,000 BC would have been awesome under the direction of Mel Gibson, Marcus Nispel, Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott, Zack Snyder, or any number of other good directors of epic films. Heck, I even wonder what this would have been like under Terrence Malick. But with Roland Emmerich behind the wheel, this is straight-up light and silly. If you're really curious, or a big fan of historic epics, then this might be worth a rental, but otherwise, average audiences can find better.3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)","10,000 BC"
70,romanorum1,Never Rises above Comic-Book Level,2,31 July 2015,"Creating a period piece based upon the Stone Age is very dubious because little is well known about prehistoric times, even with some evidence like fossils and cave men drawings. Nevertheless it can be safely stated that Roland Emmerich's ""10,000 BC"" fails on many levels. And the problems go way beyond the historical blunders, which include Iron Age items (swords, cages, chains), pyramids, gilded metallic pyramid top, stirrups, fabric clothing/sails with bright colors, and copper telescope. Note that the Iron Age commenced only around 1200 BC; the Copper Age began around two thousand years or so earlier. We even see a fairly accurate early modern map of the western world, including eastern South America (!). Where did these ancients get the appropriate nautical instruments for map-making? Even domesticated woolly mammoths are shown restrained by iron chain in the DESERT heat. Could not the director use Computer Generated Imagery to create mastodons instead? Hey, you can't have everything! Anyway, it is nice to learn that folks had such full and white sets of teeth then, while some women had beautiful coiffed hair and skin without scars, cuts, and scratches (even after a grueling forced march). It was interesting to learn that the Africans dined on South American chili in 10,000 BC. Beyond these fantastic facts, the movie is problematic with odd language use (unnatural English) for the era. Another annoyance is the expression ""white rain"" for snow. One would think that early man had used a simple word for ""snow"" at it is a common occurrence among mountain people. Other problems include dreadful scripting, poor pacing, ill-timed editing, and unremarkable acting. The whole muddle would have been better known as a fantasy or dream.The film, which becomes more ludicrous as it progresses, is narrated throughout by Omar Sharif. A Yagahl mountain clan of woolly mammoth hunters ekes out a meager existence (to make some sense of location, maybe they inhabit the Mt. Ararat area in eastern Turkey). But as the narrator says, before long the tribe will morph into warriors. The main character, D'Leh (Steven Strait), is looked down upon by some as his late father was unfairly perceived as a coward. The kinfolk are attacked and pillaged by prehistoric Arabic-looking slavers on horseback while two dozen or so survivors are taken prisoner (including D'Leh's love, Evolet = Camilla Belle). D'Leh and three companions quickly assemble to track the invaders. They trudge across nearly impassable mountains and thick jungles and scorching deserts. But to obtain a few slaves the ancient Arabs certainly made a cost-prohibitive and long and arduous trek (coming and going), which seems to consume about half of the feature. Along the way people encounter three types of prehistoric mammals: (1) more woolly mammoths from the Cenozoic Era's Pleistocene Period, (2) Diatrymas (large flightless birds from the Eocene), and (3) a Pleistocene saber-toothed cat (Smilodon), whose upper canines are disproportionately large and so long that the poor animal can barely extent his lower jaw beyond them! Anyway, D'Leh frees the dangerous cat, who repays him by not eating him. Because he handled himself well with the Smilodon (known as ""spear-tooth"" by natives), D'Leh is acknowledged as leader of the growing expedition by the prehistoric black Africans. At trek's finale D'Leh observes a super-advanced civilization (very very early Egyptian) under a man-god who commands the building of pyramids. The ruling nobles are prehistoric Asiatic Indians. Despite his unifying of North African warriors, D'Leh realizes that he is still outnumbered. If only he can free the captive slaves working the pyramids! Will the captured slaves even help them? Guess. The CGI is passable, and the sweep shots of the pyramids are well done. A positive element is that the use of gratuitous violence is somewhat controlled. Not that there is no carnage, but the camera cuts do spare us the potential grisly segments. Would including these scenes improve the film? Well, go back and read the first paragraph. On a typically more negative note, the movie does present some strange quotes. Here are just three of them: ""I understand your pain."" ""Don't forget to chew."" 'Tell him I am older than I look.""A defender of Director Emmerich may say that he creates movies to please crowds and make money for the major studios. While that may be, it is difficult to find those above adolescent age who would appreciate this preposterous mess. You may get through it if you do not care much about history. But it is recommended only for the incarcerated, intoxicated, deranged, and the drugged.","10,000 BC"
71,TheEmulator23,"Even for the Independence day, Stargate guy...this is bad!",3,9 March 2008,"I liked pretty much all of the past films that this guy has done (yes even Godzilla somewhat) but this is just plain bad. Now I never would have thought that not working with his usual partner (Dean Devlin) would make such a difference, but man I guess he really needs him. This film is so bad that the fact it just made 60 million over the weekend worldwide is just proof that our society is getting more brainless over time. Granted I did kind of want to see it too because I enjoyed pretty much all of the the others he's done, plus I like to see extinct CGI creatures come to life. Too bad the creatures are done really poorly. Even ""Independence Days"" Effects were better than this and that was 12 years ago! Hopefully the box office tanks because this is not worth watching, even for a dumb flick (rottentomatoes has it at 7%, WOW that is bad) this is one of the worst I've ever seen. The quality is just a little above par the same ones shown on the Sci-Fi channel and that is really bad. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone over the age of 12 because the so-called story is painfully dumb. I don't just mean mediocre dumb, I mean really really silly. Please Emmerich, get back working with your partner Devlin, because we all miss the ""Independence Days"" ""Stargates"" and even ""The Day after Tomorrow"" was pretty fun. Don't watch this, even on DVD it would be a waste of your money and worse a waste of your time. Only reason I gave it a 3 is because there are a couple decent tracking shots and some of the cinematography is decent. As far as the acting, pretty weak. Not that it's the fault of the actors per-se, because the dialog is terrible, but even the casting is really bad.

As they venture into unknown lands for the first time, the group discovers there are civilizations beyond their own and that mankind's reach is far greater than they ever knew.

Certainly not an historic account too, just a setting of the period and with its adventure of boy meets girl, boy loses girl and boy chases after girl, and that's about it, nothing more and much more less.Dire too is its script, would one rather have seen, and heard, the dialogue similar to the prehistoric gem One Million Years B.C. (1966) with its grunts, groans and snarls as to this extremely articulate tribes of hunter gathers and their fellow friends and foes? Whilst not too distracting, it seems so out of place, so, unusually bizarre, so out of character.Oddly enough is the bizarre and shocking moment when the hero releases, when trapped, one giant Spear-Tooth on the bargain that it just does not eat him when he becomes free. Now, this has to be the least unbelievable scene in movie history, this was needed to propel the plot agreed, but, what a wasted opportunity to not have Spear-Tooth do his part proper, a magnificent beast, then he'd only become the unspoken Aslan of his time if he became more involved.Pampered and coated with candyfloss, this children's movie will only reach the levels of the mentality that it deliberately reaches out to. It may astound them, it may intrigue them, but, as a movie itself, it fails to have the determination to be anything else but a low budget adventure movie with poor qualities and a disappointing ending that beggar's belief.The CGI, in parts, are interesting, with the panoramic's of the Pyramids and the Mammoths themselves, but, there seems to be some poor quality in the picture itself, with it trading from clean and clear wide shots to dark, grainy and dirty moments. A poor standard indeed and did I notice too some poor imagery of superimposing? I think I may have, such a poor, again, standard for today's cinema capabilities. However, this only leads to the obvious, and this films main drawback being the budget. With non A-Listers here, which really does not hamper this film directly, and with some of these prehistoric beasts having ""under-make-over's"", all this to help to keep costs down, and then its script just adds up to a plain and simple, if a little sickly, sign of the times that is 10,000 B.C.: Out of date and dead.","10,000 BC"
76,gary-444,Just Plain Dreadful,2,21 March 2008,"I went to see this movie not expecting much. Some epic scenery, a few battles with animals and rival tribes, the odd heaving bosom and a frothy pop corn story. Sadly i was still disappointed.Never can so much money, particularly on cgi and special effects have been spent to so little effect.None of the actors is worthy of a name check - although i suspect that the threadbare script found numerous first choices ""busy"".Charaecteristaion is pretty much non existent, which you can get away with if you have a rip roaring fast moving script.But this isn't. the cinematography is quite sweeping, and the music quite ""nice"".

His alack of humanity, a trade characteristic for him, undermines what few shreds of invention this film has.Two sequences, the ""mammoth"" hunt and the ""ostrich attack"" in the jungle had great dramatic possibilities, bot both ere squandered, as were the possibilities of pretty much the entire story.","10,000 BC"

Man loses woman to different tribe, man seeks to regain. But along the way, he meets many more tribes and references to the beginning of ethnic conflict. Was it the way previous peoples interacted that early on is a question, but it did not bring anything really to the film.The ending sequence after the ho-hum climatic fight didn't seem all that worthwhile.

There's also a flock of ""terror birds""--lethal ostriches on steroids--in a steaming jungle only a splice away from the heroes' snow-dusted alpine habitat. And lo, somewhere in the vastness of the North African desert lies a city whose slave inhabitants alternately teem like the crowds in Quo Vadis during the burning of Rome and trudge in hieratic ally menacing formations like the workers in Metropolis. That's pretty much it for the cool stuff. Setting movies in prehistoric times is dicey. Apart from the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence in 2001: A Space Odyssey, only Quest for Fire makes the grade, and its creators had the good sense to limit the duologue to grunts and moans. 10,000 BC boasts a quasi-biblical narrator (Omar Sharif) and characters who speak in formed, albeit uninteresting, sentences--including a New Agey ""I understand your pain."" But let no one say the storytelling isn't primitive. The narrator speaks of ""the legend of the child with the blue eyes"" and bingo, here's the kid now. When, grown up to be Camilla Belle, she's carried off by ""four-legged demons""--guys on horseback to you--the neighbor boy (Steven Strait) who hankers to make myth with her leads a rescue mission into the great unknown world beyond their mountaintop. His name is D'Leh, which is Held, the German for ""knight,"" spelled backward. So yes, there is some hidden meaning after all. 10,000 BC is the latest triumph of the ersatz from writer-director Roland Emmerich. Like Stargate (1994), Independence Day (1996), and The Day After Tomorrow (2004) before it, it's shamelessly cobbled together out of every movie Emmerich can remember to pilfer from (though to be fair, the section in per-ancient Egypt harks back to his own Stargate). Emmerich's saving grace is that his films' cheesiness is so flagrant, his narratives so geared for instant gratification, he can seem like a kid simultaneously improvising and acting out a story in his backyard: ""P'tend there's this alien ... p'tend maybe he came from Atlantis or something....""

Stupid.Of course, as has been pointed out many times, it is historically, geographically and culturally inaccurate to the point of being amusing. But I don't think the makers set out to produce an educational film about stone age life. It sets out (IMO) to be a fairy tale, fantasy story aimed mainly at kids. Who cares if steel didn't arrive until 8000 years after this is set? Who cares that none of the tribe look as if they are related, and all have access to high-tech grooming devices and listen to Bob Marley records. If that bothers you, then don't watch this film.For what it is, it works well enough. There are some epic sets and scenes that elevate it above the level of most kids' movies. Acting is not particularly strong here, with Ms Belle being noticeably lacking in those skills (a view based on at least 6 movies I've watched her in) although she does look nice, from some angles at least.So it's a bit of fun for the young at heart with a few moral (almost Biblical) lessons thrown in for good measure.

There's D'Leh (Steven Strait), a young mammoth hunter who carries the burden of being the son of a man who had abandoned his people. Rejected by his playmates, D'Leh finds companionship in Evolet (Camilla Belle), a woman who was taken in by his tribe when hers was killed by the ""four-legged demons."" When Evolet and a few others of D'Leh's tribe is kidnapped and the rescue mission begins, there isn't much to ""10,000 B.C."" other than a lavish display of pixelated versions of prehistoric fauna, held up by some predictable exposition and some anachronistic mess. The actors' attempts to characterize the world they inhabit are bogged down by histrionics that pierce through the make-up while they speak of a heavily accented English that passes off as a prehistoric language.""10,000 B.C."" barely provides for its targeted audiences and as soon as the novelty of the mammoths and the saber-toothed tigers wears out, all that's left is a movie with little flesh and all bones.","10,000 BC"
84,Rcwilkinson123,"Adventurous, but with too many historical inaccuracies to ignore",5,30 May 2008,"'10,000 BC' represents a movie that has a high quality of fast-paced, adventurous entertainment, and if that's all you're going for, then by all means go. However, if you want a smart film that considers real-life situations, this isn't the film to attend.No doubt, this movie is plenty exciting, and has a somewhat engaging hero's journey to boot. The film has a strong focus on those who have sacrificed protecting the Hunter, who will be D'Leh- the one who will lead a revolt and bring others to freedom. A classic hero story, to be sure.But it's in this very prophesy where there are are problems- from a love relationship that is established on no ground, to the connection of an 'Old Mother' that is downright annoying and makes the grand plot very strange. This plot also considers a tiger looking out for a human, and trying to maintain peace between two tribes- very odd.Also, there are so many historical inaccuracies and casting problems that cause distractions from the actual exciting and grand nature of the movie.There are so many historical problems- great civilizations with pyramids and social class levels; saber-tooth tigers; complex vessels (no, not canoes); telescopes; and even corn and the weather don't belong at this point in the world's history. I really don't understand why they wouldn't almost fix this problem by naming the film '5000 BC,' or more accurately, '3000 BC.' Maybe even '1000 BC.' I guess they didn't care about completely being ignorant about history and looking at advertising the movie from a marketing angle. They must have found that a film named '10,000 BC' drew a larger audience than the above mentioned suggested names. I know that I would have gone either way.The casting of Camilla Belle made for huge problems. Here we are, in this part of the world where all of the tribes and clans are dark-skinned, yet you get this white-skinned American wearing heavy mascara. Completely out of place. How they didn't consider this when casting, is beyond me. The casters could have easily found a talented dark-skinned young woman to play the crucial role of Evolet. Elisha Castle-Hughes, anyone? Aside from casting, from an acting perspective, Belle needs to be told to go back to movies where 10-year- olds don't care about the quality of acting. Yes, Camilla- go back to Aquamarine. Standing there all cute, looking distressed every single scene won't cut it in a movie that is trying to be epic and spectacular.While not on the same level, much like 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End,' I wanted to like this movie a lot. But there are problems. Sure, it is plenty exciting. Without a doubt, worth paying $1.25 at a decent theater to go see. Heck, I'd probably pay five bucks or less for the DVD. But a strange plot, with overwhelming historical problems and bad casting make this a mediocre feature. To see a great epic film this summer, go to 'Prince Caspian.'","10,000 BC"

How many times have you ever heard of movies marketing itself as one of the most epic films, then bombs? But it was different with this movie.

I walked in with the expectations above. And while I'm writing this like the movie build- up this horrible expectation but surprises me with it's brilliance, it's all a gimmick. The movie exactly how I imagined...So, you probably are wondering why I'm writing this film off. One (well really doesn't factor into my story so much) the inaccuracies. I suspected that this was the only thing the movie would do right, but what the hell were they thinking?! The movie was so fantasy-like, I was almost bored. I suspected a realistic approach with the time era, actually giving the movie hope in it's foreshadows. But it does what it does. It IS what it is.. The movie was actually pretty boring. The movie could've saved itself by another inch if it actually did what the trailer did. I wanted some kick-ass action sequences with tension. This was the exact problem. There was NO tension whatsoever. The unrealistic aspect falls into this too, because I wanted to believe that this stuff happened, but then ended up bored because I knew it never happened. I know movies are escapism, but the movie had no escapism whatsoever. The movie drags itself on (which was surprising since the movie is only 109 minutes.) It just goes from boring scene, boring scene, action scene with no tension, and then another boring scene. The movie structures itself like I just said. I was bored, stupendously bored.. Now maybe the film could've said itself with some good acting? Maybe even a twist to it's unrealistic-being? Wrong. The acting was bad. Now I mean REALLY bad. The actors didn't know what they were doing, and you can basically see them reading their lines off index cards. That's not called acting, that's called reading. And you can tell by their facial expressions they're very bored and just want their money. That's their goal to get through this train wreck.You suspected a recommend or not recommend? I think you can tell it's a bad movie, period.1/10.","10,000 BC"
86,pkzeewiz,Glad to see most people hate this film,2,19 April 2010,"A young boy's girlfriend is taken and made a slave to build the pyramids of Egypt and serve for the king. He goes out to find her and finds many tribes who have family members also stolen and they all go to war.I was first mad about the million flaws with the time period in this movie, it has many from foods, to clothes, to hygiene, to animals, jewelry, locations, climates, speaking English and so so many more things that didn't fit with this time period or this place. Stuff like that kills a movie for me and makes me think of it as dumb and misleading.Many movies come out like this every year and they all pretty much suck to me, I hate period pieces cause most are too flawed, movies like this and 300 are just horrible. I mean amongst all the flaws, again the Englih speaking with funny accents was enough to make me want to turn it off. I made myself finish it and by 30 minutes into the film it was excruciating, the ugly cast and stupid CGI and all was getting to me. At the end there is a bit of excitement, and the film has some beautiful (unappriate but beautiful) scenes at times. I did like the movie revolving around slaves building the pyramids, the timing was off, but this movie was so flawed it couldn't hurt, right? Perhaps it was so bad that I laughed a lot and thats why I gave it two stars out of 10...I wouldn't let my wet saber tooth tiger watch this movie its so bad...","10,000 BC"
87,kooleshwar,"Ordinary most of the times, merely good even at its best.",4,21 March 2008,"No surprises here, another high budget blockbuster attempt, with no name actors, where the special effects are the real stars.But once again the teaser trailer was quite appealing, and Roland Emmerich has produced some really nice material such as Independence Day, 13th floor etc. Not to mention that the chicks not bad either.But what really convinced me was the fact, that i hadn't seen a movie in about a month and I really wanted to see one,and I had nothing better to do.However I did go with no expectations nevertheless.The movie had a such a corny opening, that my heart sank immediately i realised that Good was the maximum rating i was going to get. A FEW DOZEN DEMOGRAPHICALLY CORRECT (black,white,tribal,asian,latino) CHANTING AROUND A FIRE AND TALK OF A PROPHECY REALLY SETS THE MOOD RIGHT.A few more corny dialogues and narration (Omar sharief wasted), and we had the best scene of the movie, the mammoth hunt, which unfortunately was merely good thanks to merely very good special effects at best,THE MOVIE WENT DOWNHILL FROM THERE AND HIT THE ""ORDINARY PLATEAU"" AND SAVE FOR A FEW SMALL BUMPS AND SMALL DEPRESSION IT NEVER REALLY LEFT IT.The movie has loads of corny dialogues never once crossing into the decent category.Acting is decent especially from Cliff Curtis (looks completely Indian is not), and Affif Badra (again looks Indian probably Arabic), but the corny script never allows them to shine. Camille looks hot in many scenes but THERE Wasn't ANY GRATIFYING BUT UNNECESSARY (in terms of the plot) EXPOSURE FROM HERE.Plot holes are a major issue and many of us in the theater were having a hearty laugh in the theater cracking jokes on them especially during what we call the ""WALK ACROSS CONTINENTS"".SPECIAL EFFECTS AND THE BUDGET WERE GIVEN PRIORITY AND THE STORY Definitely TOOK A BACKSEAT, I'm sure the cost per minute of scenes with the important creatures like the mammoth and sabre tooth, and shot of the pyramids were calculated and the plot was worked around how much screen time was available for these.Many scenes, characters, makeup, special effects, looked lifted straight out of other blockbusters such as 300, mummy etc.WHAT REALLY MAKES THIS MOVIE FALL BELOW THE ACCEPTABLE LINE IS THE CLIMAX WHICH IS SO POOR that its almost surprising.My initial feeling at the end was that it wasn't bad, but neither was it any good, BUT THIS VERDICT HAD A lot TO DO WITH THE REASONS I WENT FOR THIS MOVIE.Watch only if you fit into my bracket, and even then cheap prices or DVD would be better.-s PLOT HOLES,DIALOGUES,wasted villains, weak script,PATHETIC ENDING,LOTS OF PLAGIARISM.+/-s plot (would a better script have made this good?).+s a few good actors, Camille, some good special effects, one or 2 decent scenes.total 4/10 (my feeling was 5 but most people wont see this movie in my situation and i don't want to raise false hopes that this movie is OK).","10,000 BC"

89,freaky_dave,"My quick review of 10,000 BC",6,8 March 2008,"Not the best movie to come out, but it really isn't the worse Roland Emmerich movie I've ever seen. THat fate belongs to Godzilla back in 1993 I think.Yes the dialoque is wooden, and the actors just props to move the story along, but for some small reason I was entertained a little bit. I liked the vast scenery of the background, even though the creature effects looked a little cheesy. I would've still enjoyed seeing more creature action because the trailer made it seem as though there would be more of them. Sadly, there were only the Mammoths, the lone Sabertooth tiger for just a few minutes, and the crazy ostriches. The majority of the story has to do with D'leh (Steven Strait) and a small group of his clan going after his girl Evolet (Camilla Belle) and a few other members of the clan who were kidnapped by another clan that they refer to as the four legged demons. Along the way, they build alliances with other clans who help them fight the four legged demon crowd and their masters who are referred to as gods.I did not expect a movie that was historically accurate, this movie is far far from that, but I did expect to be entertained. This movie provides some of that, but not quite enough. If you want to let your brain rest and just be entertained, this movie isn't the worse film you'll ever see. However, I can not quite recommend it because there wasn't enough action. WIth a movie like this that has no strong drama to keep the plot going, you need non stop action. This movie sags at times and becomes somewhat boring. SO I'll give it a 6 out of 10","10,000 BC"
90,springsunnywinter,"10,000 times worse",1,20 October 2008,"There was something likable about Roland Emmerich's previous films Independence Day and Godzilla maybe because they where brainlessly entertaining but I hated The Day after Tomorrow and 10,000 BC is 10,000 times worse. I intended to see the movie on the cinema but I never got the chance so I rented it and I was so glad that I didn't see it on the big screen.I fast forwarded most of the film 5 minutes after the mammoths scene because I just couldn't bare the boredom and I wanted the movie to end as soon as possible otherwise I would've ended up in 10,000 AD by the slow pace. I have never fast forwarded a film so much in my life, the fast forward was at its top speed and I only played the scene where the sabre-tooth tiger appeared then I fast forwarded the rest.Roland Emmerich was not a good director anyway although he makes really high budget movies but he is losing is touch and is becoming worse. A good director always makes his next film better than the previous ones. Overall it was an absolute rubbish movie that has a low rating on IMDb but I still fell that it's overrated and should be on the bottom 100.","10,000 BC"
91,QueenoftheGoons,One of the very best movies i've ever seen,10,22 June 2021,"We watched it for the animals, then Curtis popped into it, and the really rough voiced killer was spell binding. This movie was good for a lot of reasons. The saving of the saber tooth cat was very nice, and later when he spared the warrior was a nice touch. The mammoths were spell binding. This is one of the best its even on my favorites shelf in the living room.","10,000 BC"
92,Spaceygirl,Terrible!!!!!,1,18 August 2008,"I hate my sisters' boyfriend!!! He brought a DVD home one night, the first time he's paid for ANYTHING, proudly inserted it into our top-of-the-range DVD player and pronounced that we were about to watch the movie of the year. Seriously, I might add. He LIED!!! This has to be the BIGGEST pile of dog-poo I have EVER had the misfortune to have inflicted on me. When I had picked myself off the lounge floor, from laughing so much at the bad acting, I then proceeded to point out all the flaws in the movie. My mother kept telling me to shut up, till I pointed out that mammoths, like modern-day elephants are NOT led by a 'male bull' (as 10 000bc would have us believe) but by a female, did she sit up and take notice, seeing as living in Africa we actually KNOW these things! Mother then pointed out that the Terror Birds were from South America...that corn was from the New World and that chili's originated in South America also! The Boyfriend was not amused with us and left in a huff. He didn't even stay for long enough for us to point out the flaws about the boats with sails and the paper scrolls in ""Ancient Egypt"". Shame. Poor guy, he hasn't chosen another movie since. Can't imagine why. :)","10,000 BC"
93,ltlacey,Prehistoric man in his elements,1,29 June 2008,"Sad to say, but this has got to be one of the worst movies I have had to sit through, and I barely made it 10 minutes before I decided that I was not wasting another second on this drivel. Let me tell you, we do not pay movie critics enough, what with the junk being released lately. It was bad enough that the characters were speaking in modern-day English, and some with various accents at that. But also, in this ""family"" clan, there seem to be members from different races as well. What gives with that? And mammoth hunters followed the herds, as did most clans of that time period. They did not set up camps and wait for the mammoth to come strolling by. I did try to watch it with a large grain of salt, but all my years of taking anthropology and ancient history classes did this movie in for me. My husband, who has not had any of these classes, left after 6 minutes. I finally had had it when the mammoth were within range and the clan were crawling through the grass where these massive animals were walking, and all I could think was, If this was the case we would not be here today! What idiot would lay in the grass where large animals are walking, grazing, and er, doing their business? Not to mention, the animals would have smelled the humans and taken off ASAP. And then the ridiculous scene of catching a mammoth with a net. That's like trying to catch a great white shark with a tropical fish net. Whoever decided to give the go ahead to make this disaster should have paid for some experts to make sure the film was at least somewhat plausible. Shoot, a simple Google search by some underpaid intern would have been better than what we got. Want to watch something realistic, then watch Quest for Fire, or at least the insipid Clan of the Cave Bear. At least these 2 movies were more true to what anthropologists and historians agree actually occurred.","10,000 BC"
94,kevin_crighton,"Spectacular, but empty",5,18 March 2008,"10,000 BC is a movie about a village that is attacked and has it's people taken away to be made into slaves. A trio of hunters from the village, head off in pursuit...The movie is written by Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser. The plot is similar to that of Apocalypto. However, whereas Apocalypto was subtitled, this movie is in 'english.' And sadly this shows up some of the poor dialog in the script. It also shows up some of the weak acting involved.Roland Emmerich is a good director of the spectacular action movie. You only have to look at movies such as Independence Day, or The Patriot to see he can handle the action and scale of these movies. And on this side he doesn't disappoint. Though not a lot of action in the movie it is done pretty well, but the scale of the movie is at least ambitious and for that Emmerich deserves some credit. Having said that, there was a moment towards the end I thought we were in the middle of a Stargate prequel! As a spectacle it is very impressive. Sadly the acting and script let it down. What it leaves is a movie that is wonderful to look at, but sadly a little empty on the emotional side.","10,000 BC"
95,Ozzy2000,Really dumb,4,5 July 2008,"This silly film about a bunch of Neo-Rastafarian and African tribes battle prehistoric animals extinct for millions of years in 10,000 BC, which is twelve thousand years ago. Mammoths are used to build the pyramids in Luxor in Egypt which is totally ridiculous and non-factual as there were never Mammoths in this region. We then endure this scene where this quasi Rasta group over throw the Pyramid builders army by causing the mammoths to revolt. This Rasta group is lead by a group the ""Hello Kitty"" Sabre tooth tiger that has developed a special ""Hello Kitty"" bond with them. The film reaches new depths as a blue eyed girl or the ""paris Hilton"" of the times is held captive by the great white caucasion one who runs the Pyramid Building Company with his Bollywood priests. I give this multicultural Rasta movie one star for the ""Hello Kitty"" element.","10,000 BC"

But I did not hate it.he dialog was wretched, the acting was poor with few exceptions,and the story blew. But I did not hate it and I was entertained. At times I was even drawn in, but then the direction or story would take another silly or bad turn and pop me back out of movie land...The CGI was good.","10,000 BC"
97,Dragoneyed363,"Very unjustly criticized, in my honest opinion",7,2 July 2008,"While I was certainly not going to watch 10,000 B.C. expecting a masterpiece, I got much more than I bargained for as well. While the film is not excellent, it entertained me thoroughly and I was interested throughout the entire watch and surprised after it was over. It is pelted with comments and reviews about how it is poorly written, edited and played out, though I am here to counter those three accusations, because I, like a few numbers of people, thought it was enjoyable.The movie could upset many scientists or people who love and or respect history. Having mammoths in what looks like the Ice Age, large Velociraptor-like birds in an immense jungle and Egyptians all in the same time era, it seems like the movie just threw a whole bunch of material together. However, I am always willing to accept that even with information and proof on past time eras, we can never be 100% certain on anything, and I judged this film not on it's historical accuracy, but it's entertainment and enjoyment levels. The characters, while a lot are a bit unbelievable or one-dimensional, all pass the time effectively and fill in for what is needed in the story. The storyline itself is probably my favorite aspect, having some wonderful material to work with and really nice effects and performances from the lead man and Camilla Belle, who is regarded as a horrid actress, but I very well liked in this and her other work.It is nicely done, in the sense that I am interested and entertained with how everything moves along, and even though it seems like it is unsure on which direction it should go at some points, it never jumps subject, even if it does jump scenes. I do not understand Roland Emmerich, though. It seems at times that he just did not want to concentrate on or deal with this film, having some very poorly played out scenes. Even if I liked the way it moved along, he was not as dedicated as he could have been on this movie like he was Godzilla and even The Day After Tomorrow. The movie also has some poor dialogue and some material just does not make sense, but I still however stand by my approval of it. It is not as bad as many claim, even if it is not amazing. It is worth the watch if you want to watch it.","10,000 BC"
98,joestank15,A Nightmare.,2,30 November 2008,"10,000 BC - A prehistoric epic that follows a young mammoth hunter named D'Leh(Steven Strait) in his journey through uncharted territory to secure the future of his tribe. Said tribe has it's own token black comic relief kid and an Indian ""spirit mother"". Yeah, it's that kind of film. Brace yourselves.Jesus this movie was exhausting. It's under two hours long but it took me two sittings to make it through. Bottom line: it's BORING. Of course I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but this film just did not deliver by any standard. When one views the spectacle of Mammoths, in a desert no less, helping to build some pyramids the shark has officially been jumped. This is quite possibly the dumbest most mechanically made film I have seen in awhile. I've heard NASA uses ""Armageddon"" to train it's students by having them write all the scientific goofs. History professors could follow that example with this film's anachronisms. The only things I think this film got right was that there were people in existence in 10,000 BC, and they used spears for weaponry.Roland Emmerich, maker of ""The Patriot""(and THAT heavily flawed film is a comparative masterpiece), directs. Not satisfied with having turned the British into Nazis in ""The Patriot"" and global warming into a joke in ""The Day After Tomorrow"", in ""10000 BC"" Emmerich has demonized Egyptians and Arabs by making them all into Huns and Aliens with inhuman spooky voices to boot, just to make sure everyone knows who to root for.The main hero and heroine are white faced and speak English, presumably to match their pure Christian souls (and make no mistake, Emmerich wants his main guy to be Jesus). D'Leh looks like Orlando Bloom with dreadlocks. Everyone else is mix and match ethnic. Indian, Native American, Ethiopian, doesn't matter to Emmerich. To compensate, most of the characters have dreadlocks, which look awful. It's the worst historical film attempt since Disney's Pocahontas. At least that one had some song and dance numbers.This wouldn't be such a hideous thing (well, parts of it still would) if the film were even a drop of fun. It's not. The screenplay feels like a very rough first draft. Emmerich and Harald Kloser (Alien vrs Predator) have no idea what people thousands of years ago would have had to talk about, so the dialog is as bland as communion wafers. Plot points are telegraphed a mile away. Idiocy in the main character is mistaken for nobility. The CGI is pretty crummy and the action sequences offer little to ease the pounding boredom. This film might have entertained me when I was 5.Not a single redeeming factor except for pretty landscapes, 10,000 BC gets a D-","10,000 BC"
99,merrywood,Exquisite film craft.,9,7 March 2008,"Beautifully hand-crafted story and motion picture in epic nomenclature, category and style, a grand adventure. Its very well written story falls into genre but not into cliché. The film has many audience pleasing surprises along the way. 10,000 BC is exquisite with a fine cast and eye catching production values highlighted by seamless digital graphics, sound effects and music score. There are elements of violence but it has to do with survival and is not the gratuitous, pathologically sadistic, psychotic-babble of the corrosive and soulless crime films of recent times. While not supported by what we believe is the history of the epoch this minor aspect is quickly forgotten before the marvelous panoramic visual scope of the yarn. Beyond all of that it carries an interesting subtext of mysticism and perhaps how human belief systems begin. This is grand, first class entertainment and a highly recommended film construction wonderfully narrated by Omar Sharif.","10,000 BC"
100,billion_mucks,Sometimes I shouldn't be so optimistic...,2,14 March 2008,"I cannot explain the disappointment 10000 BC caused on me. This review is mainly directed to those who have the mild common sense of directing into this site to prevent upon their future movie.Even though there are nicely achieved scenes, relying all chips on CGI and dynamics, the movie causes simply NO EMOTION. You won't be excited, eager to know, afraid, nervous, happy, wretched. It will all be a faux circus of attractive effects, and a very thin, thin story.The love plot is cheesy, as in the soap operas way, flat out unengaging, ridiculously acted.Plot holes vary from the time line exposure to big details. A Big Question is why did they make the main village talk English and other tribes speak in different languages? ?? Besides, it has the undecency of copying movies like ""300"", ""Apocalypto"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""Lord of the Rings"" among others.Please, I ask you for your sake, do not see this movie. Before going to jail, I have to do communitary service. And this is the best service I can do to you: Avoid this movie.","10,000 BC"

The first time I saw this film I liked it except for the part about the pyramids. They weren't around then - or were they? It got me researching and it turns out we don't really know when they were built - one millenia is as good as another. The brillant idea of mammoths used in construction explains a lot - it kind of makes sense! However I wasn't looking for historical accuracy just some entertainment. As for them speaking English in the movie - I was glad for that to enabling understanding. I wouldn't begrudge them dubbing it in other languages in other countries.

That's what I paid my money for! Not a documentary or historical fiction, but a FANTASTIC, DREAM-LIKE story.Nor do you have to be a genius to figure this out! The movie works on many levels. First, as an adventure story, a saga, like Lord of the Rings. I felt swept away. It's also an enjoyable love story. The chemistry between the actors is excellent. I cared about the characters. In addition to being erotic! - Its been a long time since I've seen so many good looking men and women on the Big Screen all at one time! Very little of the violence is graphic or gratuitous. You can tell a fantastic story without blood and guts flying everywhere. It's also a movie suitable for older children.Tribal people and people of color are shown with respect. Their rich variety of physical features, skin colors, dress, languages and architecture are shown in all its glory. Before the White Man came, and ruined everything, there was mind boggling cultural diversity on this planet! What is most striking to me is the very moving and insightful portrayal of a Medicine Women performing profound acts of shamanism in order to help protect her people as best as she can. This is the very first time I seen such a pivotal role for tribal spiritual beliefs in a big Hollywood fantasy film! My hats off to the whomever wrote the screenplay! You did your homework!Granted the ending did bother me a bit. It begs the question: Did the ancient Egyptians actually treat their workers that poorly? If only the Egyptians didn't use slaves, and treated their workers well. And what a metaphor for the year 2008, where most workers in the world are treated like dirt and instead of whips, the fear of dire poverty is used to keep most of the world's workers in line.But I digress, this is a great movie. At the end a tear rolled down my cheek, and and I felt good when I left the theater. That's all I can ask of a story. My money was well spent, for a change!","10,000 BC"
103,eastbergholt2002,Big Dumb Movie,2,9 March 2008,"Unfortunately 10,000 BC is probably the worst movie I've seen in some time. It's so bad it almost seems like a spoof of 1,000,000 BC, Apocalypto and the Matrix. The acting is wooden, the dialog awful and the story preposterous. There is a lot of cosmic mumbo-jumbo and the narration is pretentious and often hilarious. I was disappointed because I've enjoyed several of Roland Emmerich's movies and assumed the bad reviews were probably unfair. Stargate, Independence Day and the Day After Tomorrow were far-fetched yet fun. The characters were likable and the films had a good mix of action and humor. Anyone over the age of eight will have trouble taking 10,000 BC seriously, it's moronic.D'Leh (Steven Strait) is a mammoth hunter / caveman living in the mountains. A mysterious sadistic creature is building a giant pyramid in ancient Egypt and there is a labor shortage. When D'Leh's girlfriend Evolet (Camilla Belle) is kidnapped by slave traders and taken to Egypt he organizes a posse to rescue her. The other tribes in the region join in the quest because they also want to stop the brawn drain. All of the tribes are waiting for the man of destiny who the prophets say will lead them to victory over the evil Egyptians. They decide that D'Leh is the ""one"" because he talks to Saber Tooth Tigers. Interestingly, although D'Leh's tribe is white and looks northern European, many of the neighboring tribes are black. On his travels D'Leh fights dinosaurs and meets interesting people but eventually arrives in Egypt, kills the bad guys and gets his girlfriend back.","10,000 BC"
104,loufalce,A Guilty Pleasure,7,24 March 2008,"Good brain dead fun. Forget the glaring historical inaccuracies, put your brain on hold and be prepared to enjoy a fun film. Seeing that the future will not be so great a young mammoth hunter gathers his tribe and makes their way to a land where they can make a new start. Along the way they encounter-and fight off woolly mammoths and saber tooth tigers- animals that were extinct at this time frame.They also encounter a woman who may or may not be a key to their survival.Later on when our multi-cultural prehistoric friends see the boats with the triangular sails- craft that did not appear until the 17th. centuryAD, they know they are close to their destination. I will not give too much away, but it resembles an Egyptian society that, in real life came some 7,000 years after the story takes place. They join the other slaves and the mammoths that are being used for draft animals and rebel. Film is ludicrous, very historically inaccurate, and the CGI effects do look cheesy. It also borrows {somewhat} a theme from John Fords classic ""The Searchers"".The English speaking cast are no-name non stars, people you never have heard about before, and probably will never hear about again. A real stellar cast!As I have already said ,this is a fun film so it does not really matter. With all the very bad films currently littering the multiplexes, this is the most fun. It will never win any Academy Awards, but who cares? Recommended.","10,000 BC"
105,robertallenandersonjr,You must have a open mind when you see this movie,7,9 April 2008,"10,000 B.C. was such a very surprising movie to me. I didn't expect it to be like what it was at all. When I had first seen the previews to this movie I just kept telling myself I am not going to go see this movie. Yet I ended up seeing the movie, and I sort of liked it. The only couple of bad things were is that their wasn't enough action. It was kind of boring also, at least to other people. When the actions scenes did come on though it was awesome. The animals that they came up with were great, and they looked very real. The acting was pretty good besides for the almighty people. I think that the almighty people sort of ruined the movie. One thing that I didn't see coming was the end. It shocked me a lot at first but then you were like I figured that. I did think that the costume designing was great and the way they did the people's make up. The story was pretty good but it was just mostly all a romantic story with a little bit of action in it. So if you want a lot of action there's not a whole lot in this movie until the very end. Thats when it really kicks up. I thought the idea of having a narrator explain the story was a pretty smart thing to do for the movie. Another thing about the movie was that immediately the movie pretty much explains a lot of the story. I thought that it was pretty well explained. This movie was sort of was just like 300. So all and all if you like those kind of movies I think that you will like this movie. It had some great visuals and a pretty good story.","10,000 BC"
106,japamo,Mammoths Don't Gallop,4,30 October 2014,"Admittedly, my memory of 10,000 B.C. is a bit unstable after watching it on HBO a few years ago. I remember the rudimentary plot - young warrior of woolly mammoth hunting tribe is predestined to save his azure-eyed girlfriend from a more advanced Egyptian-like race. I remember (I think) the opening shot of the mammoth hunt where the young warrior earns his stripes by standing his ground and holding a spear for a mammoth to impale itself upon. I remember the mammoth tribe's journey across several jumbled climate zones (grassland, jungle, desert) to retrieve the young woman, Evolet. I certainly remember the encounter with the carnivorous terror-birds (Phorusracos), one of the few exciting parts of the movie. I sorta remember a man from another tribe agreeing to help the young mammoth hunter (can't remember his name) in his quest. I remember the young hunter being trapped in some watery hole with an enormous saber-tooth cat and the hunter saying something hilariously to the effect, ""I'll free you if you promise not to eat me"". He frees the cat and the cat doesn't eat him. However, the sabertooth doesn't do much else in the movie. And, yeah, I remember, the Egyptian-like civilization using mammoths to construct their monuments and pyramids (actually not a bad touch).However, what I most remember is a physical impossibility - mammoths galloping like horses over the meadows. Now, like most elephants, mammoths would have managed at best a shuffling walk - pretty fast but no gallop. It was logical gaffes like this that actually made me realize what a junk heap of a movie 10,000 B.C. really is, if you stop to think about it. If you don't think about it, which I did for a while, it's a fairly entertaining pulp B-movie.","10,000 BC"
107,simonparker1990,"Watch Captain Caveman instead, its more fun and more historically accurate!",3,16 March 2008,"As I start my review I have to remark that Independence Day is a great movie. I remember watching it for the first time, sure I wasn't old enough to watch it, but I did anyway, and I loved it. It was funny, smart, not original, but god damn it was entertaining! Roland Emmerich can be a very talented director, its a shame then that his past few movies really have been very mediocre movies. Godzilla was a horrendous movie, take out the half decent effects the film was a hollow shell of a movie. The Day After Tomorrow was just a giant lecture in my eyes, sure the effects looked nice and there is nothing more thrilling than a giant wave about toe crush New York, but it was just so tedious and self obsessed. And now we come to 10,000 BC, perhaps Emmerich's lowest point in his career. While watching 10,000 BC I didn't know how to react at all. When the giant dodo monsters (yes that you read that right) I burst out laughing. When there was a scene involving mammoths building the pyramids I sat there my mouth hanging wide open because it was so ridiculously untrue. The acting was poor, the effects occasionally shoddy (just watch the opening mammoth hunt and wonder why they didn't scrap the scene), and the script so stupid that had the movie not been shot well I would have walked out. Thankfully the action scenes do manage to work very well, the dodo chase is thrilling if absurd, the mammoth charge near the end is thrilling, and there are a few notable set pieces that will raise your pulse ever so slightly. Yet for a film advertised as a huge blockbuster, with incredible effect, huge monster scraps and lots of running, its a shame that so much time is spent just aimlessly wandering through the desert! So let me go onto the acting in the movie. The film is just a showcase of people with talent ranging from distinctly mediocre, to pretty terrible. The lead man, whose characters name I do not remember at all, is played by Steven Strait. This is one of his first big roles, and if I'm honest after this performance he'll be lucky if her ever acts again. The man just has no charisma, no personality, nothing. He has a bad script and he manages to make his lines even more boring. Scenes where he sprouts absurd lines just made me ponder why I was still in the cinema, and the embarrassingly cheesy spicy chili scene (again once again I apologise for the fact that this is true) just eye gougingly awful. The lead woman of the movie played by Camilla Belle just made me wonder why the main character would cross huge amounts of land to rescue her. In my opinion she was way too boring for anyone to risk their lives trying to rescue. Hell if she was that boring I'd have forgotten her no sooner had she gone. Cliff Curtis delivers the one respectable performance but unfortunately has the worst name in cinema history, Tic'Tic. Curits' character at least seems to have a heart and an ounce of personality. Its a shame the script sees fit to barely ever use the character. Oh and then I get onto the worst character in the movie, Old Mother. Sorry but what was the point! Mona Hammond (an ex-Eastenders actress I hasten to add) has nothing to do but look panicky, make grunting noises and open her eyes dramatically when something vital happens.OK if I'm honest the film isn't all bad. Whenever the action picks up the movie seems like it might just scrap passable. The movie has a nice epic scale and is shot reasonably well. Unfortunately that really is the extent of the movies good points. The first twenty minutes of the movie sees next to nothing happening, the first mammoth chase looks so fake that its not exciting just distracting. The middle section of the movie is arguably the highlight because stuff seems to be happening, no matter how stupid it is. The second third of the movie is horrendous as nothing happens at all! They arrive at the pyramid, I got a tiny bit excited as it looked like it would pick up finally, and then they just sat around talking for over half an hour! Before this they wandered through an extremely long and tedious desert, and then they did nothing at their destination! The final fight is slightly more exciting, sure its obviously historically wrong, but the movie has some momentum finally and it made me like the movie a bit more. Unfortunately the script is just poor, I'd go as far to say its one of the worst scripts I have heard in quite a while. I suppose the movie will appeal to very easily pleased kids aged about 12, but anyone older, or anyone with an IQ larger than the size of a gnat will get quickly bored.10,000 BC is not the worst movie of all time, its just an incredibly stupid and annoyingly dull movie. We got 300 last year and that was a triumph, this movie is just a limp fish of a blockbuster and Emmerich's low point of his career. Watch it if you want a forgettable, dull, over-long experience, but then again I don't really think anybody wants that.","10,000 BC"
108,Scoval71,Absolute Garbage,1,7 May 2008,"Rated 1 for awful, and that is an understatement. Hardly tolerable. Hardly watchable with horrendous acting. Why is the whole movie shot as if no sunlight existed back then? I also never knew cavemen spoke in grammatically correct, absolutely perfect English sentences, were so well groomed and well mannered. Just an very, very unrealistic movie that is so fake and unreal that it is intolerable, as I mentioned, to watch. Please don't buy the DVD and rent it if you absolutely must, but I promise you, you will shut it off after about 45 minutes, if that long. Just absolute garbage with a stupid, inane storyline, ridiculous plot, men on horseback that look like they belong in a Highlander movie. Did I say ""garbage"" enough?","10,000 BC"

I mean it wasn't prolific by any stretch. And while i would normally say that a movie stole from another, i would say that this tactfully borrowed and paid homage to the films that it borrowed from.We saw bit of Apacalypto, with a touch Braveheart. A smidge of Stargate, and a dash of the Bible. Added with a twist of Jurassic Park (if you see it, you'll know exactly what i am talking about), and garnished with just a bit, but not too much of Pathfinder.So yeah, watching it was like baking a cake...It did move a bit slow at first, and the plot did take just a wee bit long to unfold. That was apparent when the couple behind my wife and i decided that they had enough and quietly left the theatre. As an irony however, the plot suddenly started moving just a few minutes after they left.I would suggest waiting it out, because once it starts moving it's not too bad.One thing that did help the film was the lack of a big name Hollywood star. All the characters where in their own right and weren't stepping on one another for the top billing.All and all, it was decent for a one night fling. And probably if you don't see it in theatres, it certainly wouldn't be bad for a rental.","10,000 BC"
110,winstonsmith_84,Bad,2,13 August 2008,"Why is this movie so bad? Let's see...WEAK NARRATION: You don't put in narration if it is not absolutely needed. Anyhow, an English accented narrator tells us what is happening, to ""move the story forward."" This jerks us out of the fantasy setting back into reality, wondering who this narrator is and why does he have an English accent?) - SOPHISTICATED English ACCENTS IN A PRE-HISTORICAL WORLD: it seems like they tried to give them English accents. Hmmmm, cave men using sophisticated English accents. That is just... wrong on so many levels. Where is their tea and biscuits? Didn't the producers realize that it is absolutely ridiculous to have cavemen with spears and dressed in face-paint, dirt, carrying spears, speaking in English accents? It would have been better to develop a language for them and use subtitles. But the director doesn't have much faith in the intelligence of the audience.BAD CASTING: multicultural looking people in the same tribe??? For example, at 8:16 into the movie, what is up with the black kid being from the same tribe as the white guy??? Also, why do they all look like Calvin Klein models with lots of dirt on them? - ROMANTIC THREAD LACKS ANYTHING INTERESTING: The romance between the main character and his lover is so by-the-book lacking any complexity or interest... It's even worse than the love story in the news Star Wars movies. And that is tough to beat.MOTIVATION & CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT & DIALOGUE: No real surprises in the motives of characters... you can almost predict every scene before it happens. The dialogue is so forced and unrealistic. Thus, the characters would not develop and their names, faces, and everything is lost.Absolutely not entertaining. A sad mess of a movie. And will that narrator shut up!?","10,000 BC"
111,Manal1987,One big failure and nothing else!,2,8 September 2011,"I don't know from where to start actually, since nothing seems to pull off in this movie. The first letdown is the casting.. or shall I say the miscasting? Camilla Belle kept this soulless gaze of hers throughout the entire movie and Steven Strait just couldn't convince me of being a primitive or even a hero; there is something childish and funny about his face that always takes you back to the image of a 21st century teenager. Story-wise, the movie is a cliché brought down to triteness: a simple young man who suddenly turns out to be a hero saving his tribe (and the tribes nearby as well!). History-wise, I guess historians and geologists must be choking themselves right now due to the nonsensical sequence of events and haphazard portrayal of peoples and tribes. 10,000 BC will always remain a stain on the career of such a great director as Roland Emmerich who should to be told that making a successful movie about primitive life needs more than funny costumes and CGI creatures.","10,000 BC"

The prehistoric animals were a nice touch, but it felt unreal to me. As you've seen in the commercial, this movie tried real hard to be an epic. Like Braveheart almost. Where an unknown villager becomes a leader preaching to an army before they go to war. That's how a lot of movies based on history goes. I've seen that with slightly variations, (Braveheart, King Arthur, 300) and I wound up leaving the movie indifferent knowing that this movie failed to compete with these movies. Oh well, just another movie on the back burner. I guess it makes a good resume builder for the actors. Nothing solid here, nothing worth remembering. 3 for 10.","10,000 BC"
113,jake-179,"Terrible, unwatchable, completely stupid",1,9 March 2008,"You can see from my summary that I totally hated this movie. I thought that the previews for the movie made it look pretty interesting, but the movie itself was absolutely terrible. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I was skeptical going in considering that it came from the same idiots that made ""THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW."" I would say that ""10,000 BC"" is just as bad as ""THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW."" Both movies were horrible, completely unwatchable, mindless, and totally boring. But I thought since these guys also made ""INDEPENDENCE DAY,"" which was pretty good, that this movie maybe had a chance. I was disappointed, needless to say.The acting was terrible, but what can you expect with such a poorly written script? The main problem that I want to discuss is the flow of the story action. In standard mythical structure, the second act of the movie should show the circumstances of the hero going from bad to worse, with the end of the second act being the most stressful and suspense filled for the hero and the audience alike. This movie kind of went the other way. As the movie progressed through what can only loosely be called the second act, the hero's circumstances actually IMPROVED, as he gradually raised his army to help him. This story was totally linear, meaning that there were no twists, turns, or surprises in the plot. The hero simply went after the bad guys to rescue his girl, and never really encountered any major obstacles or challenges on his quest. The closer he got to rescuing the girl, the more allies and resources he had to accomplish his goal. This made for a completely boring movie experience. And not to mention, there was no real character development or even drama for that matter.One other thing I noticed: there was no chemistry between the leading man and the leading lady. These two characters were supposed to be completely in love and devoted to each other, and yet, physical contact between the two is completely lacking. They do not even share ONE single on-screen kiss. Perhaps they did in the absolute final scene, I don't know for certain because I literally walked out of this movie before it had completely ended. I left shortly after the girl magically comes back to life after being killed. That part of the movie was PARTICULARLY STUPID and UNREALISTIC.AVOID THIS MOVIE! IT SUCKED!","10,000 BC"

115,tomb_92,"Confusing, boring, disappointing.",4,24 August 2009,"I didn't like this really, for a number of reasons. Firstly, I was put of by the strange setting. The film is called 10000 BC and is set in the ice ages (a genre which is indeed neglected) though half-way through the film we find a mighty civilisation inhabiting an area of desert that seems to resemble the ancient Egyptians. This was a little confusing, crossed time-periods? or simply a small dose of fantasy? Who cares, the film bored me half to death anyway with its all too simple plot. As I have mentioned this is a neglected genre, but nevertheless this film does a poor job of waving the flag for films set in pre-civilisation times. Put it this way, I fell asleep for about 20 minutes half-way through, woke up and could still follow the plot exactly. I actually had no idea that I had even fallen asleep as the characters were still in the same place and talking to the same people. On the other hand, there are some slightly tense fight scenes and the CGI is quite impressive. I wouldn't watch again, and wouldn't recommend","10,000 BC"
116,Red_Flag,"Behold, the dumbest film ever made",1,25 April 2008,"Director Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow) is no stranger to what I like to call ""CGI Overload"" I mean what with his epic disaster movie crashing onto our screens only 3 years ago which short changed audiences our any emotion but provided a solid is overuse of special effects. Despite its flaws ""The Day After Tomorrow"" was still rather enjoyable. The same cannot be said for the directors latest ""10,000 BC"" that's more reminiscent of his 1999 poor Godzilla remake. Lousy does not even begin to describe 10,000 BC. The fantastic effects and set pieces are merely a cover for the shameful plot and the fact that this isn't even entertaining let alone scientifically correct. Fans of prehistory will be better off watching a film that doesn't decide to mock its surroundings much like this one does, try something more historically correct like The Flintstones.Though I do remember the director's decision to cast good-looking clean cut English speaking actors for the roles, a drastic comparison if you ask me to the rough dirty and foreign cave men that existed around that time. And only the man who got away with making Godzilla so damn ugly can try to make a giant turkey scary, trust me it didn't work.The plots as tired as anything. Boy loves Girl.Girl gets kidnapped. Boy spends half of the film recruiting several 100 men tribes only to have the ability to slay his enemy in one short 10 second time period.Not only is half of 10,000 BC completely pointless but it's also unbearably irritating only twice before have I felt tempted to walk out of the cinema. During a screening of Scary Movie 4 and Epic Movie. Now that's saying something. The fact that it has skyrocketed to the top of the American box office is only reason to worry even more. Its generous payoff means the studio can simply produce more of these things. And that's not fun.The most peculiar thing about this is the fact that this film shows no sign of the directors earlier (better) work ""Independence Day"". In fact this film shows no direction work at all. Most likely just a string of unscripted ideas strung together at the last moment plus some dazzling GCI Work and then all that is left for the makers to do is hold tight and hope the audience bought the trailers.My final verdict is that you should avoid this no star film as if your life depended on it. At the start of 08 I was convinced Alien vs. Predator: requiem would be the most disastrous film to come out. I was wrong, very wrong. Enter 10,000 BC a spectacular waste of time, money and ""talent"". Even the average slob is too sophisticated for this steaming pile of cinema garbage. Avoid at all costs this is car crash cinema at its very worst. I have given films a ""unwatchable"" review before but never really meant it. Until now.","10,000 BC"

I went not having read any critical reviews or comments here on IMDb, but not expecting to get my moneys worth either. I have to tell you, I was NOT disappointed. If you are a comic book fan, a fan of action adventures, you are going to like this movie. It's quite a while since I heard the audience applaud at the end of a movie in our theater, but they did. Definitely not an Oscar type movie, by any means, but a great popcorn movie, and kids will love it too, there's lots of action, but not a lot of gore, if any at all. Great creatures too, the woolly mammoths, the saber toothed tiger (under utilized I thought) and those terrifying bird/dinosaur creatures in the bamboo swamp. I love Oscar winning movies, but I also enjoy a good action movie, the type that's not made anymore, a good old fashioned one... and this is a good old fashioned one!!","10,000 BC"
118,mrspasm,A Missed Opportunity,5,9 June 2009,"This film is set roughly around the first century, before there were dinosaurs, and when Mammoths ruled the earth. (No Doug McClure) It would have been more pleasing to mine eye had they filmed it in the 2nd century when there were plenty of dinosaurs, imagine the exciting scenes of running away from a Ginormous Rex, swinging through trees to avoid flyingsaurs, and all the thunder lizards stomping around the pyramids near the end of the movie. Cool! Anyway, enough of what good have been- the film makers have their own ideas I suppose.In a village up in the mountains somewhere live a herd of cavemen and cavewomenmen. They have a tough but enjoyable existence, hunting fish, bears, and of course Wooly Mummies. The time has come however to select a new leader for the tribe- a group of the hardiest teen males have to fight it out in a series of tasks to prove that they are the best in each area- strength, speed, courage, wisdom, and heart. We are introduced to our hero- Tuk Tuk. He is the main candidate for President, but his main rival Tik Tak is just as good, and has a more minty taste. Through into the mix a beautiful girl both men love, and an old sight seeing hag who says scary things about the future like 'oooh, One with blue eyes shall be the ruin of us' and 'ooh, beware going across the mountains to the forbidden land' and 'oooh, tomorrow there will be a strong south easterly wind'. The games begin, and Tuk Tuk and Tik Tak (under the guidance of another old warrior, Trevor) excel in each event. It comes to the 'Catch a Mammoth' event, where the one who catches a mammoth proves himself to be the best. Tik Tik is a bit of a scumbag and tries to cheat, and in the process almost wipes out the village and kill everyone. Suffice to say, our hero saves the day, forgives Mip Mip, and gets the girl. When a travelling group of marauders steal the girl (I believe her name was also Tuk Tuk leading to some confusion), Tik, Tak, Trev and the gang set out on a deadly quest, encounters tigers, freaks, and other assorted terrors.Now this is hardly an original film- in fact it steals many ideas from Saving Private Ryan (the group putting themselves in danger to save someone), and other films such was 1,000,000 BC and 1,000,000,000,000 AD have done it better. I loved those films growing up. My brother Andy and myself used to play 'Dinosaur!' and 'The People That Time Forgot', re-enacting our favourite scenes. I was always Doug McClure, while Andy played an assortment of goodies, baddies, and beasties. We would put all the cushions from the sofas onto the floor, and jump from one to the next, pretending the floor was lava. 'You fell in, you're out of the game!' I would shout. 'No I didn't!' Andy would reply. 'You did! Your foot touched the lava, na na, you're dead!' I cried. 'Shut up, leave me alone. I'm gonna tell mummy on you' Andy would moan. I would then punch his arm till he cried, or we would both run straight across the lava, putting our lives at risk to get to mummy first. 'Shut up the pair of ye, or you'll both go to bed!' Mummy would say.Yes, they should have had Doug McClure in this movie. Just as the epic battle scene (which was well filmed, but not very well directed) was about to begin, he could have flown in in his plane and thrown a few stiff rights and lefts about. But alas, this was not to happen. To be fair the effects here were very good. I've never seen such a realistic tiger, not even at the zoo, and there were lots of exciting moments. I understand that I let myself be disappointed by expecting things from films, just like I am disappointed by life. Michael Bay would go on to direct bigger and better things, and a few members of the cast joined ER and Desperate Housewives (I think I saw Trevor in The Bill once, running away from Reg) but this is above all an entertaining, popcorn, coke, and sticky floor kind of film.Best Scene: When all the mammoths are stampeding the mansion of the bad guys, and they all get crushed under the big hairy feet.

Aside from a few exciting scenes with rampaging mammoths, giant Raptors gone wild, and one lone, altruistic Saber-Tooth Tiger, the film just plods along through a willing-suspension-of-disbelief series of disconnected geographic landscapes and jumbled-up anthropology. The plot is full of logic holes that are too numerous to list here. The lead actors look and speak like 21st century humans dressed in Flintstones costumes. The friends I was with were so bored with the film they thought it ran longer than the 109- minute duration. 10,000 B.C. has a few interesting parallels to a truly classic prehistoric tale, the 1981 ""Quest For Fire."" A cross-country search by a band of cavemen, encounters with alien cultures, mysticism, and triumphant return to the tribe. Quest for Fire had no special effects (even the Mammoths were elephants in cheesy costumes) or even English dialog (nor subtitles).

That's all it took to overthrow the pyramid-builders? Why didn't anyone do it before? If you're going to build a pyramid, wouldn't you probably wait until you had a city first?

I watched the first 25 minutes before turning it off thinking it was very poor, but was happily surprised to return a few days later and enjoy the rest. That's correct, I enjoyed this movie. The hero is not some Harry Potter geek, he's actually a man who is fighting for real stuff: justice, liberty, community. He is a strong underdog which adds to the appeal of the plot. There is a lot comraderie, brotherly love, family bonds etc. I especially admired the traditional respect for animals; the acknowledgement of the spirit of animals. My early thoughts were that the tribe did not look or sound real and that the set looked hockie. I felt the costuming, and definitely the sets, improved as the movie progressed.

I tend to like movies that a lot of other people seem to hate. I don't scoff at CGI effects-driven spectacle kind of movies, like a lot of snobby critics.And I couldn't care less about historical accuracy either. This is essentially a fantasy movie, barely rooted in reality, so people complaining about how it's not real are wasting their time.The thing that doesn't work for me here are the dull characters, particularly the main caveman guy and his girlfriend. The plot revolves around them and yet they barely have much personality beyond the guy being just a very simple determined hero, with nothing more to him, and the girl simply being wide-eyed and scared almost the whole time. If they were a little more interesting, this movie could have been good.For a better, proto-civilization era fantasy epic, watch Conan the Barbarian, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger instead.

They are said to have gone extinct about 2 million years ago when the North and South American continents collided. Let's see. That's about 1,988,000 years before the movie's time frame. Oh well! And these giant birds certainly wouldn't have been hunters in a bamboo forest. Think the plains of Patagonia! At least D'Leh didn't end up battling a T. rex (although I was half expecting this).

We don't need no stinkin' historical accuracy!""In short, this movie could have been more appropriately titled: In a Galaxy Far, Far Away! In addition, the acting was wooden at best and the script pathetic. I give it a 2 out of 10 for some interesting visual effects.

Most of the criticism seems to be that the film is not 'realistic'. Since when has film been realistic? Not even so-called documentaries are realistic, so what's the problem with a post-Pleistocene parable? No one knows what it was like, and any representation is just that, a representation. I enjoyed the film for its allegory; triumph of the spirit, connectedness to nature (killing an animal out of necessity yet respecting its right to existence), the importance of the spirit world and ancestors. Even the ending that has been derided (the life breath of the spirit woman giving life to the dead female protagonist) was a magical moment reminding us of knowledge we have lost and now take time to mock. Film does not have to have a gripping storyline, and 10,000 BC is no more than Finding Nemo, or the Day After Tomorrow. Film must not be realistic, otherwise it is cinema verité, and that is not very popular! Film by definition is fantasy, and on that level 10,000 BC is enjoyable. A lot of the cinematography is haunting and evocative, creating an atmosphere, which is what fantasy does. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and was moved by the attitudes of the so-called primitives. The melange of historical memes only made the film interesting, anything was possible. Why not?

127,dmanyc,"10,000 B.C. (for bull crap)",1,21 March 2009,"After watching this film on HBO, it's plainly obvious the budget went to the special effects whereas the screenplay and talented actors went out the window. What I want to know is: 1) Why is the hero cast as a wuss? The hero is suppose to be a good guy that's brave, not get stuck in netting, lets the mammoth land on the spear, and become the Sabertooth Whisperer.2) Who decided to cast a hot chick with lousy acting ability to be the passive heroine and have her stick out like a sore thumb, especially with those blue eyes? She looked like she was waiting for a Maxim photo shoot.3) How did the heroine score some mascara while being kidnapped? Watch her cry towards the end. Did that not look like she had some Maybellene Great Lash on her eyelashes? 4) Do we need yet another kid following around adults to some dangerous adventure when they contribute absolutely nothing to the plot nor the adventure and were told to stay behind? For once I would like a kid to actually STAY BEHIND.5) Since when do tribesmen in 10,000 B.C. speak English? Shouldn't they be speaking in Ooga-Booga language or something? 6) Was it just me or did one of the guys that kidnapped the hot chick look like a cross between Sean Penn and Popeye? 7) Omar Sharif, how could you? How could you let your voice be attached to this?","10,000 BC"
128,soger,For the love of God!,8,29 June 2008,"I'm so sick of the ignorant people's comments.This movie is not:1) documentary. So enough with the comments stating that it has historical inaccuracies. The role of a movie is not to tell exactly what happened in the past. Are you mad at a poet if his/her poem is not about the history?2) theater piece. So enough with the comments complaining that the story is not good enough. There is a shiny place called a ""theater"" where actors perform in real time, where there is no editing, no CGI so in a theater you can expect a good story, because there is nothing else. I'm sorry if I disappoint anyone but this is not true for the cinema (at least in general). And don't blame the movie makers, they are shooting movies they can sell.This movie is:1) entertaining. Well... it is not a life altering experience, but it can entertain you for 90 minutes. The story is not so complicated so it is ideal if you are tired and you want to rest.2) filled with pretty nice visual effects. It looked good; at least from where I was sitting :)3) a remake? Well... it show similarities with other movies; that is a fact. But come on when did you see last time a movie that was completely new?And if you disagree with me you should think about why did you watch the movie in the first place. I mean this movie was exactly what I expected it to be.","10,000 BC"
129,manxman-1,So bad it's not funny? Oh yes it is!,3,12 March 2008,"Awful, awful, awful! Dumb as a brick. Was the English language quite so cultured as this ten thousand years ago and did everybody have such perfect teeth? When the villains of the piece appear on horseback to enslave the good guys you immediately smell the rottenness of the script. (""The four leg monsters are approaching"". Hunh?) When the hero of the piece falls into a pit where a saber toothed tiger is drowning and says, ""I'll help you if you don't eat me"" you wonder how nobody could have thunk 'Well gee, is this just too dumb for audiences to swallow?' You half expect the tiger to make some kind of verbal response, which would really have landed us in looney-tunesville. You get the payoff from this scene when the tiger reappears to save the hero from the hands of a native tribe, obliging the hero by again not eating him. In a perpetual pursuit of the kidnapped love interest, after various contrived incidents, including an attack by savage CGI chickens that Colonel Sanders would have been proud of, we wind up in some pseudo-Egyptian, pyramid-building country with some vaguely extra-terrestrial leader who really isn't. In the screening I attended the audience was rolling in the aisles at just how dumb this movie is. The CGI effects? Well, we've seen them all before and it would have been nice to have had some kind of story and characters to back the effects up. And yes, as so many other people have pointed out, it does indeed bear more than a vague resemblance to the Mel Gibson flick Apocalypto, minus the intelligence and story direction. The ending of the movie had everyone in the audience howling with derision. If the makers of this movie were aiming for the lowest common denominator then they have unerringly hit their mark. Hard not to believe that this won't top the worst movie list at year's end.","10,000 BC"
130,SombeeKillah,"""Tell Him... I Am Older Than I look!""",6,1 April 2012,"Not as bad as I thought it would be. I guess I saw it in a ""good frame of mind"" day. Yes it's cheesy and full of inaccuracies, Hard to say how accurate the makers of a film like this might be trying to be, at least in a historical sense. Since this is obviously not a documentary, many ""liberties"" are taken with historical truth. For example, eighteen foot long sabre tooth tigers didn't exist in this era - nor did mastodons - at least not in the areas depicted (Mesopotamia, northeast Africa.) but I came to enjoy myself, not have a history lesson. It's what I expected from Emmerich anyways, cheesy fun. It looks he ""borrowed"" a lot from Mel Gibson. Like ""Braveheart""(1995) and ""Apocalypto(2006) But no way it measures up to those two classics.There are two alternate scenes that appear on the DVD I believe should have been in the movie instead of the one's they used. One was when D'Leh saves the sabre tooth tiger from drowning, in the alternate scene, there was no rain so the tiger was just stuck in the pit and very agitated. So instead of just ""saving his life"", D'Leh gives him some water from his pouch and says,""Do not eat me when I save your life"". This alternate scene made more sense to me because the big cat associated this human (by sniffing his scent, so he can remember it) from not only setting him free but giving him some water which he needed. The second was (I had no idea all along it was the great Omar Sharif narrating the film!? You can tell because at the end , his name is credited). In the alternate scene, Turns out he is ""Baku"" all grownup! And the movie we just saw was his storytelling in a flashback basically! He is surrounded by children of the tribe who are in awe of the story. Just like little kids are. I wish so much they would have use this version instead , this would have the perfect ending and at the same time honoring a great actor like Omar Sharif. What a shame.D'Leh is spelled ""Held"" backwards, ""Held"" being the German word for ""hero"". Roland Emmerich chose this name as an easter-egg .This film features some of the alleged controversies in history - the construction of the great pyramids 12,000 years ago, almost 7,500 years earlier, the existence of the Ben-Ben stone (the pyramidion stone that is now missing from the top of the Khafre pyramid), the correlation between the position of the pyramids and the stars from the Orion constellation (associated by the Egyptians with the god Osiris), the Sphinx with a head of a lion allegedly correlated with the Leo constellation rising to the east (at the same time when Orion is in conjunction with the Giza pyramid complex) and the possible nonhuman origin of the first kings of Egypt. Reference is also made to the Platonic theory that the construction techniques used in Egypt were imported from the ancient lost civilization of Atlantis. The movie makers include a glimpse of a map showing one of the putative locations of Atlantis, off the coast of Spain.","10,000 BC"
131,user-543-975655,Not Worth Watching,3,28 October 2013,"Save yourselves! I wanted to see this movie when it came out, because I heard it was really good. I have waited 5 years until now to see this...for absolutely nothing. The cover on some editions says that ""10,000 BC rocks; it is an adrenaline rush from start to finish. Bullcrap! Excuse my language. It really got interesting when the credits rolled out. (Dissed!) I'm a fan of Roland Emmerich, but he really disappointed me with this one. I like his other movies like 2012 and Independence Day, a lot, and I thought this movie would keep the streak going. I was utterly mistaken. It was very boring, and not really realistic. It had a cool story, really, it did, but it was ruined by horrible acting. Camilla Belle was shockingly off her game in this film. She did an absolutely wonderful job in other films like When A Stranger Calls. I'm glad though that I like some other Roland Emmerich movies, like Independence Day and 2012, mentioned above. That evened out his performance for me. He was bound to make a bad movie sometime. The acting now. Camilla Belle was really the best in this film in the area of acting. Steven Strait: I don't know if one of his above average performances, and I would hope not, but I have not seen any of his other acting work. Everyone else, really, in general, was about the same amount of acting skill. The graphics were used a lot, and probably not as much as they needed to be. Even when they could easily have used a prop, and make it look realistic, they used graphics and ruined it. They, meaning the VFX team. Really, at some points, they were actually really good, but at other times they were just really, really cheesy. They made up words for stuff that exists in real life, like Mannock, for Mammoth. You'd think that since this takes place in 10,000 BC, the people wouldn't speak absolutely fluent English. I take that back. They should at least have an accent. Like a German or North African Person. Where are they, anyway? One day it's sunny and beautiful day, and warm, the next day, it is super cold and snowing! It makes no sense! Also, if you are going to walk for a month or two, go into the mountains, and fall a bunch, and then get to a desert country, with a bench of stabbing winds and hot sand, you would think that you get tired. But Nooooo! Everyone is in tip-top shape. No scratches or anything, and then they go straight into a battle, and kill a bunch of people. That's nice! That may or may not happen, in the movie. I also think that since most of the really cool characters should be in the movie at least more than once or twice. It makes just sense. The movie was just BAD, and I'm sorry, but if you like it, you have no taste. OHHH! I've got to get to studying soon. I have a big 47 point test tomorrow. See ya!","10,000 BC"
132,Strider_1978,So bad that it is actually interesting,1,14 March 2009,"OK. . .Where do we begin with this. Which cliché or ripped off piece of source material do we begin with.There is a village somewhere in time. It's 10,000 bc so we should not have to think very hard about it. There are hills and snow, and fog and. . hold on- for every other shot the scenery has changed? OK, village elder and young boy, young girl and there is evidently going to be some destiny to follow or subplot romance? Ah yes, it's a coming of age and one of them has to kill a woolly Mammak? Yes, they do this by the most amazing strategy. They chase them down a landscape. They herd them like sheep, a band of tribal men on foot managing not to get killed in the process and they are actually scary enough to herd them into a narrow area where they capture one of them.OK blah- So there is a typical Conan style village raid and the girl gets captured along with a few others that we don't care about.So they go over mountains where we see several screen shots ripped directly from Lord of the Rings and leave the snow plains and enter into a 'its hot in here' rain forrest that looks so green that the fake grass rain forrest and giant buzzards? That inhabit it are hostile and- OK. .Now, it's worth noting that none of the actors in this bar Cliff Burton are worthy of our attention. None of them have any on screen charisma, and Cliff Burton who has some considerable talent cannot save this. So, in the 'down time' I'm trying to concentrate on what's going on because it's more interesting watching a pot of water boil, and so it requires more concentration but that's OK because the costumes are interesting as is the ludicrous scripting and I'm wondering if this might be the first picture where I fall asleep.The entertainment value of this- I'll cut a long story short because the plot really doesn't matter- when I'm not noting very obvious film rip offs and a mish mash of wardrobe that garbs characters that act worse than the script that somehow got approved by Hollywood that doesn't care because they know the trailer is enough to sell tickets- Oh yes, before I summarise I have to mention the scene where tribal folk that have come together with one or two Zulu tribes are looking at a fleet of slaver ships. I know they didn't steal it from Return of the King. I know they never thought of the black ships. . Ah, and and and, towards the very end when stoic hero slays demi god of Pyramid ala 300, which then turns into a Spartan battle.10,000 BC is amusing to me. It's amusing because they throw money at projects like this and allow this material to hit the big screens so that wide eyed movie goers can eat popcorn before they fall asleep.I ask rhetorically, is this truly what entertains people? If this is so, then the apple has fallen from a great height, it hit the snow plains before rolling into the rain forest before falling into the river and winding up by the pyramids where it gained a better sun tan.","10,000 BC"
133,petsteph1,A Family Movie,6,9 March 2008,"I don't really understand why this movie has been trashed when by comparison to say, Jumper, it was more entertaining and far less irritating. The story is fine if you don't object to an imaginative mish-mash of unrelated historical semi-facts... The dialog is a yawn but not a subversive yawn like 300. The acting is just able to keep the plot going and every now and then it even seems to be about to come into its own. The CGI is fine but maybe a little low-budget. The scenery is awesome and for a moment you begin to think you're watching LOTR, in fact my daughter who has an eye for these things pointed authoritatively at a snow covered mountain crest and said: ""Same mountain as Lord of the Rings!"" The movie borrows heavily in look from LOTR without also borrowing the smarts of that story. In fact, thinking back now I wonder if this wasn't a project that started out big and was cut down to its present scope, which is fine for a family movie but makes it vulnerable to criticism on its artistic merits.A tribe of hunter-gatherers are told by their seer that four-legged demons will come and destroy their happy existence hunting woolly mammoths. The demons come and kidnap most of the tribe including an adopted blue-eyed girl. Our hero is a young man coming into manhood who loves the blue-eyed girl. He follows the kidnappers down the Nile to the pyramids, being built by more woolly mammoths, under the direction of an elite descended from a) aliens b) Tibethans c)Indians, and recruits a small army of rebels and... it has a happy ending.There are dinosaurs, battles, good guys and bad guys, pretty goofy dialog and more great landscapes along the way.The only thing I found irritating was the editing. I was wishing the director or editor would go back to cinematographic basics and just tell the story with the tried and proved long shot-medium shot-close-up formula instead of the sudden, 'dramatic' full-screen close-ups, even in the action sequences, that made it impossible to know what was actually happening until the body count at the end of the scene. I think the editing sabotaged the performances, reducing the characters to token gestures - but every now and then a little bit of personality peeked through and that was enough for my three children to enjoy the movie a lot.There are a couple of moral issues like integrity and loyalty that are refreshing, very light on the blood and gore, and like I said it has a happy ending which was not overplayed.Take the family.","10,000 BC"
134,Sharkey360,Nothing special,5,8 March 2008,"After many months of waiting, I finally saw 10,000 B.C. and left the theater unsatisfied. The story was so predictable and its pacing was inconsistent (at some parts, I felt sleepy), in fact this may be the weakest Roland E. film in many years. The action scenes were nicely done though and the special effects (particularly on the creatures) have that photo-realistic look...this is where the film excels. I only wished that more creatures were features and the action scenes could have been extended to help the pacing.When the story reached the pyramids, it reminded me so much of Stargate, only without the laser blasters. The concept of deities and gods was present but did not really add much to the plot...it only served as a villainous model.I find it weird that the primary characters (for a change, no big stars among them) speak English on screen.So is 10,000 B.C. a special film, one that could be ""The 300 of 2008""? Nope, nothing special about it. It's nice however that a prehistoric setting was used for this adventure.If you truly value your time and money, don't watch it and just wait for the DVD instead.

135,Celluloid_Fiend,"""Historically"" Awful!",2,12 February 2019,"""10,000 B.C."" is a classic example of a film where all the budget was put into the cinematography and special effect, with little regard given to the script and acting. The results are an epic adventure tale, that is neither adventurous or epic.This story of a young hunter who faces his predestined fate to lead his tribe, could have been a compelling and intense story of human history. But the script is so horribly flawed and the acting so bland, that there is nothing to emotionally connect the audience to the characters or the story. You simply don't really care about any of it.I never bought the love story between the two lead characters. Their unemotive acting skills, hampered by a scripted romance that is so schmaltzy and unbelievable, that it isn't even worthy of being used as a dime store romance novel, much less a major budget motion picture, never brings about any sense of true emotion from the viewer. You not only don't believe these two people love each other, you don't even care enough to wonder why you feel that way. I'll admit I wasn't around back then to see how these people interacted with each other, but I can tell you it was probably nothing at all like this. And the way the girl survives to be with her man in the end, is so mind-numbingly unbelievable, it is more of an insult to the viewers intelligence, rather than the uplifting emotional moment the writers and director probably intended it to be.Another problem with the film is all the historical inaccuracies. When you want to make a film that is based on the history of the human race on Earth, if you can't create a stirring tale of fiction with human history as the backdrop, you'd do well to try to keep as close to the facts as you can. I mean, while the ancient Egyptians did use slave labor to build their vast cities and monuments, I don't believe that Woolly Mammoths were there to help in that. If this movie was about some alien world, I might be able to overlook this kind of thing, but if you are going to use actual Earth history as your setting, either use it right or don't use it at all. When it can be said that ""One Million Years B.C."" is a more historically accurate film, you know something is seriously wrong with your film's script and research.Of course, the biggest problem I personally had with the film was the extremely slow and plodding pace, as the characters spend lots of time just walking around. I could have taken mini-naps between the major scenes of the film and not felt lost when I awoke and started watching it again. We get it, alright? They are traveling great distances. You don't need to make the audience feel like they are on one themselves, as they watch the film. An adventure tale is supposed to be exciting, not boring.The one place the film does get it right, though, is the cinematography. There is some brilliant and breathtaking camera work here, with some very gorgeous wide angle shots of the lands the characters travel through. It is the one place where the film truly shines. It is not, however, anywhere near enough to reverse the detriments in the script, acting and researching of the film to make the story even remotely enjoyable.""10,000 B.C."" could have been one of the great epic adventure stories of the the last decade, but being saddled with poorly emoting actors, an unbelievable soap opera romance, historical inaccuracies you could fly a jumbo jet through, and a pace so slow and tedious it would put a snail to sleep, the film instead becomes one of the biggest and most costly of viewing disappointments, perhaps of all time (""Waterworld"" has nothing on this film, believe me)! Unless you have a bad case of insomnia, give this film a major pass.","10,000 BC"

I only went because the Norton kids movie was so politically correct, I could not take it so we changed theaters. That turned out to be a lucky switch. This film, 10,000 BC started out a little odd and seemed like there would be no story and some of the lead characters seemed pretty strange. But the film slowly picked up steam. It has a real story that draws the audience in. There was no heckling in the showing I attended. And I was surprised so many people were talking like they liked it after the film. This is not a hardcore intense film like Brave Heart or The Patriot. But the film has themes of freedom, liberty, honor, honesty, friendship, and love. It had shades of Apocolypto or 300 but with far less gore. It also seemed like some of the old Doug McClure science fiction films. It was far better than One Million years BC or Clan of the Cave Bear. It was not attempting to be an Academy Award winning film. The people of all ages liked it and nothing was inappropriate.

Boy, was I wrong.Firstly, I did not expect something this bad from Roland Emmerich. Dude, you've given us stupidly entertaining blockbusters like TDAT and ID4, even Stargate. What happened here? Nothing adds up. The bad acting, the hair do's, the mammoths, even the sabre tooth, predictable. Boring. The scenes are copied from all over the place. Apocalypto, 300, even Jurassic Park. At one part I actually thought a mammoth was gonna talk. How bad is that? I cannot understand why they would make this movie. It's that bad.The CGI wasn't all that great either. The mammoth look like hairy masses of goo. Sickly even. The sabre tooth has the face of a Bengal tiger. The giant ostriches or whatever they were look like they've been made to imitate raptors. WTF! Last, why, Mr Emmerich, did you make us believe that there was a squaring of between a caveman and a sabre tooth in the movie? The posters? Well, its just a gimmick. Sit home and watch the trailers.

I thought it would be an adrenaline ride with no plot that you can only fully appreciate if you see it in Imax 3-D - similar to (but worse than) Beowulf. Especially since it had gotten really terrible reviews and everyone who'd seen it told me not to waste the few bucks it would cost to rent it. Well, I finally shelled out the money, and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not only as exciting as the trailers promised, it did have a plot and was enjoyable. I will not pretend that it was a brilliant movie, because it just wasn't. It definitely had the premise of what could've been a triumph, but it just couldn't cut it. There was some cheesy dialog, but mostly it was pretty original. The plot was something that could've been ripped off from any ancient folktale, but I think that the scriptwriters and directors did a decent job of making it their own. Seeing as it's supposed to be a legend, and proves itself to be more of a fantasy than historical epic, the historical inaccuracies can be forgiven. All in all, it was a fairly good movie that was both thrilling and enjoyable. I can see why people didn't like it, but, honestly, they're being much too tough on it.","10,000 BC"

Along the way, he encounters killer ostriches, a friendly saber tooth tiger, and some nice Zulu warriors who introduce him to farming.

(OK, the bad guys in 300 are Persians, not Arabs, but the audience for these movies can't tell the difference.)

141,keiichi73,"Not fun, not even in a cheesy sense",1,7 March 2008,"Some critics have moaned that as film technology grows, the storytelling ability of the movies shrinks. I have never quite agreed with this assessment, as I believe there is a place for spectacle of any variety, even the mindless kind. However, to those who share the view of those critics, 10,000 B.C. will most likely be the most convincing piece of evidence to their argument. Here is a movie that looks like it cost millions to make, but is saddled with a screenplay that looks like it came from the Dollar Store.Director and co-writer, Roland Emmerich is no stranger to brainless spectacles. This is the guy who brought us Independence Day and 1998's Hollywood take on Godzilla, after all. There's a very fine line between brainless and just plain brain dead, unfortunately. 10,000 B.C. is short on spectacle, short on plot, and short on just about anything that people go to the movies for. There are characters and a love story to drive the bare bones plot, but this seems to be added in as an afterthought. I got the impression that Emmerich and fellow screenwriter, Harald Kloser (a film score composer making his first screenplay credit), had the idea for a couple cool scenes, then tried to add a bunch of filler material between them. They threw in some sketchy characters that hardly reach two dimensions to inhabit this filler, and called it a screenplay. In order for spectacle to work, even the cheese-filled variety such as this, there has to be something for the audience to get excited about. This movie is just one big tease.The plot, if it can even be called that, is set in the days of early man. The heroes are an unnamed tribal people who speak perfect English, all have the bodies of supermodels, and hunt mammoths for food. The two characters we're supposed to be focused on are a pair of young lovers named D'Leh (Steven Strait) and Evolet (Camilla Belle). Why they are in love, and why we should care about them, the movie never goes out of its way to explain. The rest of the villagers do not really matter. They exist simply to be captured when a group of foreign invaders come riding into their peaceful tribe, and kidnap most of them to work as slaves back in their own home colony. Evolet is one of the captured, so D'Leh and a small handful of others set out to find where they've been taken to, and to seek the aid of other tribes that have also been invaded by this enemy. There's a mammoth herd here, a saber tooth tiger there, but they have nothing to do with anything. They're just computer generated special effects who are there simply because the filmmakers felt the current scene needed a special effect shot. I'd be more impressed if the effects didn't look so out of place with the actors most of the time.10,000 B.C. probably would have worked better as a silent movie, or a subtitled one, as most of the dialogue that comes out of the mouths of these people are as wooden as the spears they carry. The good tribes are the only people in this movie who have mastered the Queen's English, naturally. The evil invading tribe speak in subtitles, and sometimes have their voices mechanically altered and lowered, so that they sound more threatening and demonic. No one in this movie is allowed to have a personality, or act differently from one another. Everybody in each tribe talks, thinks, and behaves exactly the same, with facial hair and differing body types being the main way to tell them apart. This would make it hard to get involved in the story, but the movie dodges this tricky issue by not even having a story in the first place. Once the film's main tribe is attacked, the movie turns into an endless string of filler material and padding to drag the whole thing out to feature length. Aside from a brief encounter with some bird-like prehistoric creatures, there are no moments of action or danger until D'Leh and his followers reach the land of the invading army. The movie throws a saber tooth tiger encounter to fool us into thinking something's gonna happen, but the tiger winds up being just as boring as the human characters inhabiting the movie, and is just millions in special effects budget wasted on something that didn't need to be there in the first place, other than to move the shaky plot along.There is a key ingredient missing in 10,000 B.C., and that is fun. This movie is not fun to watch at all. I kept on waiting for something, anything, to happen. When something eventually did happen, it was usually underwhelming. I know of people who are interested in seeing this movie, because of the special effects, or because they think it looks enjoyably cheesy. To those people, I say please do not be drawn in by curiosity. This isn't even enjoyable in a bad sense. Your precious time is worth more than what any theater may be charging to see this movie.

142,adam_uk09,Ridiculously Stupid But Entertaining None The Less,5,5 April 2008,"Roland Emmerich has been in a bit of trouble lately, since films like Independence Day, he seems to have lost his touch. The Day After Tomorrow was a visual feast, but had woefully underdeveloped characters in a thin plot.I hoped that 10,000 BC would be a return to top form for the troubled director.As usual, the CGI was brilliant and the set pieces looked of the finest quality, but that does not excuse the fact that this film was absolutely ridiculous. A dire plot and again underdeveloped characters speaking the most stupid dialogue made this film even more incomprehensible.The acting by all but a few of the cast was at best average, with the dialogue making their efforts even worse.Sitting through this film was enjoyable, but for the wrong reasons, laughing at a film that is meant to be taken seriously is something that i have never done before. A first for everything then?Totally stupid and badly directed, but enjoyable if you switch your brain off before viewing.","10,000 BC"

144,yourmotheratemydog715,Wow. I'm actually amazed at how bad this was.,3,8 July 2008,"I'm amazed that something this bad made it into nationwide release and actually made money. I'm serious, I can't comprehend how bad this movie was.So, here's the ""plot"". (There's no real plot.) So, the movie starts off with something about this Old Mother person saying that this D'Leh is destined to help the tribe. Then, there's something about a white bone thing. Okay I can't explain that crap. Basically, there's a caveman that goes after this girl that was captured. That's about it. Oh, and there's mammoths. And saber-tooth tigers.I didn't go into this expecting much. I had just watched Roeper say it was ""The worst movie of the year so far"". The commercials made it look horrible. And it was from Roland Emmerich, who doesn't have the greatest directing track record. But wow. I could never have imagined how bad this movie actually was. I seriously can't think of a good part of this movie, other than the feeling of relief I got when it was over. What's bad about it, you ask? Where to start, where to start.Alright, I'll start with the insanely bad acting and dialog. Sure, Emmerich casted nobodies, but did he really need to pick the absolute WORST actors he could find? There's not one person in this cast that delivered a worthwhile performance. It might have been the fact that the actors sucked, or it could have been the script's fault. I know this was ""10,000 years before Christ"" or whatever, but is that an excuse to have the most unnatural dialog ever written? The narration is horrible, and is talking about some legend of the child with blue eyes when the characters are just getting attacked by mammoths. Everybody talks like they're trying to be bad actors! It's as if they had the script in their hands and they were reading it for the first time to the camera! It's horrible! Trying to find good dialog in this movie is like trying to find a good song by Fall Out Boy. It's impossible.And that's not the only thing. Most of the freaking' movie is just this guy swinging sticks at CGI mammoths. Oh, and he talks to saber-tooth tigers. Oh, and there's these guys with extremely long fingernails that have no real significance. Oh, but they're GODS. And you can only kill them if you have the shape of a star on your hands. What??? And there's some connection between this old lady and the two main characters. The old lady serves no purpose whatsoever other than to give bad facial expressions when something bad happens to the main character.Plus the fact that the movie is about as historically accurate as a 6-year-old trying to teach history class. I know that the movie is just supposed to be fun, and it doesn't really matter if it's historically accurate, but seriously, the main girl is OBVIOUSLY wearing makeup the entire movie! Now, I wasn't alive in 10,000 BC (obviously) but I'm pretty sure they didn't have a ""makeup hut"". It's as if Emmerich took viewers for complete retards and decided to make basically every asset of this movie completely historically inaccurate.You learn nothing about the characters, other than the fact that they're destined for something. And the fact is, you don't CARE that you don't know anything about the characters, because you just want the movie to be over as fast as possible.I don't have anything to recommend about this movie, as it was utterly horrible. I won't give it a 1, because I only give 1's to the new lows in film-making (""Meet the Spartans""). So, I'll give it a 3, for each minute I was entertained by this piece of crap.Please SKIP IT. Go see one of the movies that this shamelessly stole from. I'm kind of rambling, so I'll stop now.","10,000 BC"
145,oaksong,It's about Myth making stupid,8,9 March 2008,"It's a shame how few people appear to have listened to the opening narration of the film. And someone was carping about stuff being copied from elsewhere. I guess that person doesn't realize that most works are copied from bits of others, if you want to look at it that way. Even Shakespeare copied, to rather good effect.I thought this film did a great job of considering what things might have have lead to the creation of a myth, using some of our favorite mythic elements in the process.It also doesn't do it with a super duper heroic dude. Instead it starts with a schlub who can't get out of his own way who manages more by accident than by plan, and with a certain singularity of purpose, to produce a significant societal change.Frankly I thought the exercise made a lot more sense than Troy and works better than Apocolypto.","10,000 BC"

The chick he had to save .. She's uberly beautiful and well shaved and they have such a nice romance.It's hard to believe that 10000 years before Christ , man actually cared about the size of the boobies of their woman and how sexy they were . All they cared about was reproduction.I did not know either they had teeth paste.Because their teeth are whiter than mine.The story is very linear and very boring . The Main protagonist was horrible .At some point you could see him smirking during a life death situation.No it's was not a acting smirk but a bad actor trying to repel his bad acting.Anyway.More horrible than watching Paris Hilton walking.Also the villain was portrayed has Evil mutant.I don't buy this kind of evil villain.That not a marvel comic story . At least marvel , you know what you got.I'm actually half into this movie and i'm already bored . So i came here to make this review.This movie is horrible.It's barely watchable.I can't believe i spent 4 dollars to rent this pathetic movie.","10,000 BC"
147,jmcginn174,"Roland Emmerich stop making movies, please I'm begging you.",2,16 June 2011,"10,000BC is directed by Roland Emmerich The guy who directed average to bad movies in The Day After Tomorrow, The Patriot, Stargate, and the absolutely terrible movie Godzilla. So I wasn't expecting it to be a four or five star movie, but I didn't think it would be terrible. His movies are at least entertaining. This wasn't. Here's what was bad about the movie, then I'll give the one thing I liked.1. The incoherent story, just didn't make any sense.2. Bad acting and dialog, it was just funny.3. The narrator. All he did was point out the obvious. Hollywood must really think people in the US are stupid, and can't figure out what's going on by themselves, and they might be right since I spent $52.00 on this film.4. The battles were terrible, nothing special about them. They weren't exciting.OK now onto what I like.1. The special effects/Cinematography. They were the only thing that was good about this movie. The Mammoth, and Saber Tooth Tiger looked awesome.Overall I gave the movie 1/5stars. I wouldn't waste my money seeing it, wait for it to come out on DVD and rent it, then all you have to spend is $4.00. Almost forgot for you fans of Speed Racer out there I saw the preview for the movie and I've got some bad news. From the preview in my opinion it looks terrible, cheesy, it couldn't be one of the worst movies ever. I mean it looks bad. They should have just made a anime movie with voice actors, it would have been a lot better","10,000 BC"

I guess you can cobble together montages (or indeed editing room clippings) from ""Quest For Fire"", ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Stargate"" and hope to arrive at a sort of proto-version of ""Apocalypto"", but as ""10 000 B.C."" shows, that doesn't mean it's a good idea! Emmerich is capable of producing much better fare than this lame tale of a prehistoric hunter's epic journey to save his loved one, and maybe his people too in the process. It's hard to believe fairly decent movies like ""Independence Day"", ""Thirteenth Floor"" and ""Godzilla"" were made by the same director.Weighed down by wooden performances and make-up that raises far too many questions, the leads inspire very little interest. But then again, when ""Whale Rider"" alumnus Cliff Curtis has to be saddled with a character name like ""Tic'Tic"", you really have to wonder if everyone wasn't just phoning it it.One or two interesting touches are present in the narrative, but the abiding sense is that the whole thing feels like a stretch. This story has more plot holes than a mole-ridden cabbage patch.","10,000 BC"
149,drnrg31,cave men never looked better,5,22 March 2008,"My summery is meant to be sarcastic. My biggest problem with the movie is how the producers portray the cave men. Evolution had apparently already become perfect as everyone in the movie looked like a model.I may not know too much on history ,but this movie mixes what seems to be African, Egyption and Cave men tribes all in one movie. Was this meant to confuse us? Oh and did I mention that they all speak perfect English. A language that wasn't even invented yet. I would have preferred growls and grunts with neat subtitles.The most exciting parts of the movie where the prehistoric beasts. Although most of the time they seemed out of place . I kept waiting for Sinbad to pop out and save the day. Seriously this movie would have worked better as an Eye Of The Tiger remake.As for the plot line or story, if you can call out that. A love Story under cloak. Leave this kinda mush to Woody Allen.In closing. Save your money and time and wait for a rental. better yet wait for the remake of Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. nuff said:(","10,000 BC"
150,SandeepLoyalka,What's Not To Like....?!,6,1 August 2009,"Roaland Emmerich brings to us another of his signature spectacles. After Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla & The Day After Tomorrow, he has managed to dream up new vistas to er...explode. To his credit, its all done quite nicely. There is an appropriate sense of the fun & dread of adventure permeating throughout the film. An adequate score & a suitably enigmatic voice-over by Omar Sharif also help immeasurably. Snowy mountains, lush jungles, arid deserts, woolly mammoths, sabre-toothed tigers, pterodactyl/dinosaur hybrids, cavemen hunters, African tribes, ancient civilizations, giant pyramids, mysterious cults, cryptic soothsayers, mystical prophecies and men-on-a-mission....What's not to like....?!","10,000 BC"
151,ungy357,"Typical Emmerich: Big,silly fun",6,8 March 2008,"""10,000B.C."" is not a great movie.But it is a fun movie. Director Roland Emmerich has spent much of his career imitating other filmmakers,culminating in 2000s ""ThePatriot"",whichfeatured hardly an original moment.But Emmerich seem to have finally decided with his two films (this and ""The Day After Tomorrow"") that he is what he is:a guy who makes big,silly,cheesy, spectacular,popcorn blockbusters, and he's good at it. The action is thrilling,the CGI mammoth and sabre-toothed tigers are cool,and the overall mix is considerably more entertaining than last year's somewhat similar ""300"",whichwas TOO stylish,and even less substantial than this one.If you want to see a great film,find somewhere that's still running ""No Country For Old Men."" If you want a dumb fun warm-up for this summer's blockbusters,""10,000B.C.""is good bet. Emmerich is back in classic form as a rich man's Roger Corman,and that's a good thing.","10,000 BC"

At this point I am rolling my eyes...But what overwhelmed me was the overt political agenda of this film, ""White man = Bad Guy"" ""Slavers have only ever done the White Mans bidding"" and the only White people worth a damn are those that wear funky dreads...Had this demonised any other racial group as they clearly did White people then there would have been outrage and a pouring of well earned bile...","10,000 BC"

The thing with Ka'Ren, thought he'd be evil or have a proper character arc or have an impact on the story SOMEHOW, but no.The old, white dude thinking he's a god matches with reality, even in 2021 lmaoAlso, why is Evolet shown to be such a damsel in distress?

If this were say black or Asian people portrayed in such a way there would be a huge outcry from all sorts of groups but because its white people everyone is supposed to take it without any word of complaint. Well people (white people) you had better start complaining about stuff like this because its getting worse and it does nothing to promote tolerance between races at all. And by the way film and documentary and newspaper writers, I have never had a slave in my life and neither has any of my family going back 2000 years. But my ancestral family and nearly all in my country except for the elite rich have all been slaves. We were called serfs, and we were owned by the landowners for centuries. IF we ran we were hunted down and killed, if we hunted in the forest we were hung for merely trying to feed our selves. yes, this was in Britain still happening just 300 years ago. so lets just get that straight once and for all that it wasn't just black people on this earth who have been slaves. All peasantry across the world have been slaves to the elite masters. How about a film of my race and and ancestors portraying the horror we lived through for centuries.In regards the film its self, its just adds further insult that the acting is atrocious, the storyline garbage, and the whole concept just a complete farce. With such a budget I do wonder..no I regress am speechless that the people that made this film got the money to do so.

The plot is essentially the same, but in all other respects the film doesn't live up to the spectacle of Gibson's film. The chief reason for this is the poor acting by the human cast. There isn't a single character that, by the end, I cared about a tiny bit.The best thing in the film is the CGI animals. That's the problem with the film, the computer characters are more interesting than the human cast.Roland Emmerich used to be a sure bet for a good film. Although some of the action is still top class, the rest if the film is dire.

Think a little, he gave us 2 of the worst movies ever ""Independence (BS) Day"" and the ""Day After Tomorrow"", so what can you expect, that guy had one moment of genius when he wrote and directed ""Stargate"" and then he is gone.Yes the movie looks like ""Apocalytico"" and eventually even like ""Pathfinder"", but we can't start blaming the comparison, otherwise you can scrub 70% of the movies made in Hollywood that are remakes of European or Asian movies.So what I liked it actually the attempt at explaining the pyramids, the wink to the Atlantide and the fact that the ""God"" is a white man, the director is definitely mesmerised by the pyramids since they again were his main drive.And about the fact that the ""goods"" speak English and the ""bad"" a subtitled language at last that gives us a break from the ""Texas accent"" goody (no offence meant to the Texans) kicking the but of some Oxfordian English speaker bady.And I give a 4/10 it's because I'm tired of the Hollywodian f*******g happy ending mania than because","10,000 BC"

It did not take long for me to begin groaning, and not from butt cramps mind you, but from absurdity.So let me explain, Okay I thought the opening narrative should have been nixed and perhaps some hieroglyphic style text on some lost cave wall, explaining the legend of the blue eye, but that's just me.Where I really lost hope was with the Bob Marley tribe of Mammoth Hunters. The dreadlocks threw me for a loop, and I know that maybe, and I emphasis maybe because of antiquated hygiene their hair might turn out that way, but then how did they get their teeth so perfectly artificially white? Then the one gals perfectly waxed eye brows looked very nice, so nice in fact I wondered who in the tribe has the salon? The CGI mammoths and ""spear tooths"" were okay at best. The beginning hunt scene of the mammoths was so like ah...........well imagine if you were in Alaska and you decided to hunt a grizzly bear and you stabbed Mr. grizzly bear with say ah.......let me see.......why yes you decided to hunt Mr. grizzly bear with a fondue fork and you successfully slay the beast...not sure if you're getting my drift here but alas, alas the most wonderfully delightful tasty absurdity is saved for the very last, and I shan't spoil such a morsel for you.There were other points of sheer Tom Foolery with the dialog being so modern, I almost expected the lead Bob Morley dude to say, ""Let's go bust a cap in their asses"".Anyone remember that movie ""Quest for Fire""? Well there was no English nor was there subtitles and that movie came across so much more real, sincere in its execution.Oh well the good thing is they will probably make a sequel to this called, ""9,999 BC"", I can hardly wait.......Mmm","10,000 BC"

Was it some sick masochistic reason ? this is a few hours of my life I have wasted and at my age there may not be many left. The weird Conan like narration ? This is a train wreck of a movie. No amount of CGI can save this and there is NOTHING to recommend it. At least Plan 9 from Outer Space was funny. What in heck's name were they thinking of when they did this ?

The effects, as said, are pretty incredible. But with more plot holes than a colander, and a few REALLY bad effects, they are not enough to hold my attention. I actually found my self wondering what was on in the theater next door. Another example would be the shot at half speed fight scenes. Some if not many it appeared very obvious that they had been sped up, and that sort of thing just kills the suspension of disbelief. And the obvious, ""I can do better than 300 by hitting the god king with the spear"" ending was so predictable as to make the last of the movie not even worth watching . I am amazed that test audiences did not complain bitterly about it. It is one of those movies that the preview was way better than the filmAnd how hard could it have been to find a girl with blue eyes to play the girl with blue eyes anyway???I could go on but, ouch, Roland must have naked pictures of half of Hollywood to be able to get the money to make this stuff.","10,000 BC"

I though this way it could get more interesting. Well. I didn't happen and i know why (you probably know too). Ohh jeez, it sucked. And I want my two hours back.This thing flows without ANY emotion, and not even the beautiful scenarios it was filmed in were capable of triggering any sense of freedom, courage or bravery from any of the characters, which were pretty bad in their acting too. And by bad acting I don't add any exception, they're all suck.The plot is so predictable that DVD back cover couldn't be able to create no feeling of twist. And there is no twists at all. D'leh looses his girl, become an warrior, reunite and army and go after his malefactors (please, try no to confound this with Spartacus).Thre is a articular scene, were D'leh and other boring guy are tide to a net trying to catch the mammoth. Yeah, we can hear their voices ""screaming"" just like if they were sitting on a bar talking about sports. Talking about talking, WHY THE HELL they've made Warlord's voice went through digital modification? It's the same cr**p that happen with King Xerxes on 300. Something like this, just can't end up cool.Probably the worst part of everything is the English along: everything. Really?!?! Some time ago i've watched Apocalypto, and that ancient Maian stuff were what have made the movie great. But in 10.000 Before Christ the best language were probably some screams with burps and farts. Historicly it also makes thousands of mistakes. Sextant were created in 1750 AFTER Christ. Egypt Pyramids were builted up somewhere between 8000 and 4000 BC. NICE! This historical ""mistake"" (because there is, of course, some contradictions, after all is history we're talking about) reminded me about Jack O'Neil talking pyramids were builted before 8000bc by some alien civilization in Stargate (1994 - from the same director).And then we have the Narrator, which kept God of War's Athena at my mind every time he started speaking. Hahaha. Noting against Omar Shariff. His voice matches with his narrator purpose, but the problem is WHAT THE HELL WAS GAVE HIM TO SAY? Reaally, that's was painfully boring and cliché. This movie could be much better done without a single recognizable word from ANY CHARACTER. And saving the narrator to have something to get ashamed of.Soundtrack ain't amazing, but without one would be worse. Photography's not amazing, but black and white Could be worse.What was nice and saved 3 points to the whole thing were the Piramyd Building Workers (id est. slaves)... building the pyramid.

Not only do we not know what really did happen around that time as it is all simple guesswork (or, as people like to call it, the effects of research by archaeologists or other smart people who are, by nature, extremely credible), but moreover this is a FANTASY MOVIE. The sole nature of a fantasy movie is for it to be as imaginative as possible and give the watcher lots of entertainment. And this is what 10,000 BC does. The dialogue is very good, the characters and their acting is fantastic, the whole storyline is thoroughly enjoyable, emphasising the importance of values such as friendship and trust. My review won't change the fact that some apparently fully-qualified historians decided to rate this movie so low because it didn't fit their orthodox ideas of whether mammoths really existed.However, the movie is still a really good fantasy flick and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys such movies. However, if you watch a movie to look for confusing plots/endings, boring acting and a general lack of action, then avoid 10,000 BC, as it won't fit your taste.","10,000 BC"

If you break it down to its basics, it sounds cool, early man, mammoths, saber tooth tigers, raw intensity, survival of the fittest, etc. Unfortunately, that didn't inspire a story of epic proportions and the writer's had to make it more epic by introducing historical inaccuracies. I mean, pyramids, horseback riding, cloth and intricate clothing, it's all ridiculous. Coupled with lackluster action sequences, yeah the CG is good, but any sense of intensity and peril in those sequences is definitely lacking. Oh, and don't get me started on the bordering retarded dialogue, I would have preferred groans and grunts over the verbal stylings of this screenplay. It sounds like a third-grader wrote it and the acting is on par with this assessment as well. A film with a solid premise, lost its way. In trying to be epic it only succeeded in being an epic failure. I have a feeling a smaller and more compelling story centering on the real perils and plights of a caveman would have been a much better film. It sucks that this movie single handedly has ruined any more films of this ilk to come down the pipeline.","10,000 BC"
168,phantomtristan,"""Journey back to a time...""",5,7 March 2008,"The trailers for 10,000 B.C. says ""Journey back to a time of darkness, Journey to a world lost in time"" and boy oh boy, do you journey. From the opening of the film you are swept up into a stone age village in the lofty peaks of the Himalayas, next a jungle filled with prehistoric creatures, then it is an African desert plain complete with a saber-tooth tiger, all before coming to the banks of the Nile to witness the building of the Great Pyramid. All this and more is delivered to you in the diverse locations covered in 10,000 B.C. a film about the beginning of time and civilization.The film opens with narration from Omar Sharif and the story begins in a tiny mountain top village of mammoth hunters which is ravaged by ""four-legged demons"" (Hun-style soldiers on horses) who capture and kill most of the villagers, save for a handful. Among that handful is a man, D'leh (played by Steven Strait), whose lover, Evolet (played by Camilla Belle) was among the many dragged off as slaves. D'leh and two other warriors waste no time in setting off in hot pursuit of demon raiders. So the journey starts as they trek across every possible extreme landscape up until they find their villagers have been put to work as slaves to build the Great Pyramid. As the three warriors plan a way to free them they are joined by thousands of other African tribe warriors who have also lost loved ones to the slave-seeking raiders, and the final climax is one spectacular epic battle atop the pyramids including more mammoths (they apparently helped the Egyptians pull the massive stones to build the pyramids, debunking the long held theory that aliens did!).10,000 B.C. is complete eye-candy with its' extravagant CGI, vast sets, detailed costumes, and sweeping cinematography. The acting is average, nothing amazing, but nothing bad. The script is very basic but it works because you would not expect our prehistoric ancestors to break out in eloquent or snappy dialogue.Overall I was highly entertained and satisfied with outcome. Despite the film having less historical accuracy than even the recent atrocious flop, The Other Boleyn Girl, it still manages to be a good film that holds your eyes with its' magnificent visuals as well as your interest with its' characters that have just enough emotion and heart to be able to invest and connect with them (even if just slightly). 10,000 B.C. is pure exhilarating entertainment, and does what a film shouldlets you escape back to a time of darkness, to a world lost in time!","10,000 BC"
169,fisherbee1-1,Enjoyable and fun; why so serious?,7,17 April 2019,"I read reviews before watching, and was expecting this to not be great, but found myself really enjoying the movie. The effects are great, the scenery well suited to the plot, and the characters interesting and ell acted. Historical accuracy? Who knows? We don't know, and that's rather the point. A fictional account of things that might have happened is perfect for that time period, and I love the way they blended in some hints of mythology here and there, without pinning anything down too much. The movie is, at the core, an epic adventure set in a time long past, about which we know little, so they had fun with the story. Quite worth the watch. Do you want a faked documentary, that makes suppositions, or a fun movie? No more speculation here than in any number of documentaries I've seen on prehistoric times. Way more enjoyable.","10,000 BC"

The plot was hard to follow, all the young men looked the same, the narrator sounded like he was an old man from a Disney film, and everything seemed just a little too advanced for it to be 10,000 BC.Speaking of the title of my review, all of the young men really DID look the same. A thin beard, loincloth around their waist, muscular, etc. They all looked so much alike that I had a hard time figuring out who was the main character and who was one of his traveling companions.The fact that all the characters seemed to have Spanish accents confused me, I had thought that the people back then (if there were any) would talk with grunts and hoots.The ""magic"" at the end of the film was rather predictable, and apparently kissing was invented before 10,000 BC.

BIG TIME !!!!,2,18 March 2015,"My God, this film has, in everyway, ripped off the entire plot of Appocalypto.This film was boring, poorly, stupid and a complete waste of time. My biggest problem with the film is the story. It's complicated and it's stupid (especially when it gets to the climax and the death of the old woman).Also, the hero is not interesting at all. He's just the generic good guy who defies the dangers and everybody likes and saves the day and unlike Appocalypto, you don't care because he is not an engaging character. The CGI is not terrible and some of the animals and landscapes are really fun to watch. I do think there is a good movie somewhere in there trying to get out but you are just stuck with typical clichés like the ""prophecy"" stuff and the hero not believing he is the one but he is and he defies the odds and.You have seen this movie.

Wow, glad I took the time. It's not a 10 for sure, but the imagery, the ""early civilization"" theme, and the ""courageous hero against all odds"" elements were great. The CGI was better than average, and the drama and love story gave it some backbone. I thought there were some very inspiring moments in the film, and some great dialogue. I would suggest subtitles, as there are some low mumbling parts that aren't clear but important. I'm a fairly intelligent guy, and I only watch movies that get at least a 6.5 on IMDb, and I almost never watch TV, and it still boggles me why the score is so low. It's like everyone expects this to be an accurate historical fiction saga. C'mon, this is like a John Carter or something like that.","10,000 BC"

If you happen to be in that mood, this film may provide some satisfaction.One serious disappointment is that the caveman outfits don't reveal nearly enough skin, hence leaving out one of the great attractions of the traditional caveman genre. While Camilla Belle really is quite beautiful, her appeal to the eternally adolescent male's prurient interest comes nowhere near the appeal of Raquel Welch in ""One Million B.C."" or, better yet, Rae Dawn Chong in ""Quest for Fire."" The special effect animals leave something to be desired as well, although the (purely fictional) overgrown ostriches are kind of cute. In truth, the most impressive thing about this movie is the scenery, which deserves to be seen on a big screen.Men are advised not to subject the women in their lives to ""10000 B.C."" Those who do may soon find themselves suffering through ""Where the Heart Is,"" or ""Snow Falling on Cedars.""","10,000 BC"
174,xenolupa,"Very nice story, visual effects, emotions",8,22 April 2008,"This movie is definitely not as bad as its rating. Sure, there are plot holes and anachronisms, but in essence this is a love story, a wonderful adventure and action movie, it's a movie about heroism and discovery, it's a movie against barbarism, religion (they kill a god) and tyranny.There's humor in it, a lot of emotions, thrills, and a lot of great action. Nice digital and very nice visual effects. Mass movements of mammoths, enormous crowds of working slaves, a river full of ships. The panoramas of nature are wonderful: deserts, snow covered land, forests, grasslands, mountains, hills, it's like a nature documentary (just missing the voice-over of Sir Attenborough).The budget for this movie was immense and it really shows. For the people that are irritated by the anachronisms: put this movie in the same box as Lord of the Rings, Narnia and Harry Potter: it's fantasy, a fairy tale, a story. Enjoy the acting, the effects, the landscapes, the animals, the hair (wow, a lot of hair!), the wardrobes, the weapons, the huts, the jewelry. Feel like being in 5,000 BC (which would have been a better title), or like being in ""Walking with Mammoths"".","10,000 BC"

176,jack-964,Give the masses what they want: Crap,1,13 March 2008,"I read some other comments after my initial one and i have to say... the disapproving comments are far more worth my time than this movie was. Had a good laugh ;]I'm sorry i have to rate a movie a 1 again, but it's another terribly wrong movie. Here we go...The image quality & effects: I watched a cam version, so can't judge it too hard. Nonetheless it seems to me there are too many 'dark shots', which usually are for hiding (incorrect) details and/or to give the movie some cheap obscurity. The mammoths and stuff seem pretty real to me, so effects are OK i guess. Tiger didn't though.Acting & casting: No, well known actors. It's not too bad, none worth mentioning also.Story: A 10 year old could do better. Supposed to be a love/heroic epic i think, but never comes out of the closet. It doesn't grab you and in fact, while i was watching it i was chatting, which was far less boring than the movie.Context & reality: And there it goes completely off the scale, in the negative sense. Where is it? Where in history does this find it's place? It says 12000 years ago. Right, so 12000 years ago people somewhere had mammoths for pets and were riding horses? WRONG. 12000 years ago people were still nomadic, so there were no big cities with huge temples and an organized society. It were tribes existing of some dozens up to some hundreds of people. They didn't shave yet, they had no iron, not even bronze, no fancy spears and spearheads, no big sailboats etc. Mammoths were never domesticated (they got extinct at the last ice age, ~10.000 BC) and horses were not domesticated until at least 6000 years later. Saber tooth tigers lived in the America's and mammoths and horses in Eurasia. The culture(s) in the movie are a mix of Celtic, Arab, Indian and African and other, which is totally retarded. Mammoths lived in cold regions (hence the dense fur) and the people in the movie are hardly clothed at all. Again retarded. The sailboats must be of some revolutionary new design, cause they obviously sail without wind with their opposing sails. (?) I don't get why obvious Caucasians (celts or Germans) living in mountains (that should be the Alps i guess), have to travel for days to get to the negroid people, that live in a rain forest and going further south, through a desert, reach the Arabs... where there are also American natives. Apart from that, mammoths didn't live in mountains, the birds resemble dinosaurs too much (they are meat eaters and obviously hunt in groups) and have no business in a rain forest anyway, cause of the size they would definitely be in a huge disadvantage there. So is the way-to-big saber tooth tiger. The thing would get stuck in a rain forest. And i never read that this species was high on the moral scale. And so on, and so on. It's one flaw after the other.This movie has a historical value of -10 and only makes people believe in things that were never there. I hate that in a movie. Again i point to a Mel Gibson movie, 'Apocalypto' who at least got his facts right. And now we are at it, this movie seems a very bad copy of that one. Actually, like other ppl said too, the whole thing is stolen from other movies and that in itself isn't SO bad. Better well stolen than ill made, but it's far less than what it is stolen from.The majority of people will probably not object to all i said and just enjoy the simple story, but again i have to say that this wrong information has an influence on society and a producer has a responsibility...Cheap entertainment with a nasty side effect.","10,000 BC"
177,brendon-kenny,"10,000 BC combines cutting edge visual effects with stone-age storytelling...",3,19 May 2008,"This review was originally written for South Yorkshire Newspapers and featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds, and York - The end of the Ice Age is looming, heralding a fundamental shift in the lives of the Yagahl tribe of mammoth hunters. The wise 'old mother' of the mountain tribe prophesises the coming of the 'four-legged demons' and of a member of the tribe that will, in their hour of need rise to become their saviour. Enter D'Leh (Steven Strait), who steps up after a band of horseback warriors storm the settlement, enslaving the young men and capturing D'Leh's beloved Evolet (Camilla Belle). Escorted by the tribe's ageing leader Tic'tic (Cliff Curtis) and his childhood adversary Ka'Ren (Mo Zinal) D'Leh embarks upon a perilous journey across the world to save his people.10,000 BC is a film that shamelessly combines a multitude of clichés, focusing on a coming-of-age hero that must go on an epic journey to rescue his true love and face his destiny, save the world and bring down an evil civilization etc. etc. Unfortunately the story relies on the sheer quantity of these tired and tested stereotypes rather than introduce any original qualities. Admittedly they've been dressed up in a rather fetching loin cloth and, in a vain attempt to give them a new lease of life, showcased in a variety of different climes and environments as the tribesmen travel across snowy mountains, through jungles and across deserts. These scenes are regularly accompanied by an earnest narration (voiced by Omar Sharif, the only recognisable name in a cast of unknowns) presumably in a bid to add weight to the pretentious spirituality and far-fetched dialogue that blight the script.All this is really just a thinly veiled excuse for full-on Mammoth slaying set-pieces. This is where the film is undoubtedly at its best, epic scenes that seamlessly mix CGI prehistoric creatures and ancient civilizations with fast paced spear-wielding combat. This may come as little surprise to film-goers familiar with Roland Emmerich - a director of seemingly limitless ambition. His passion for immense scale and world threatening melodrama seems to increase with each of his releases. His previous works, The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Godzilla (1998) Independence Day (1996) show the hallmarks of his style  special effects laden blockbusters that sacrifice plot and character development for visual spectacle. His latest is certainly no exception. It has all of the historical accuracy of 'Ice Age' and the sincerity and straight-faced seriousness of the cast is completely at odds with the ludicrous story, cheesy dialogue and tenuous plot devices.10,000 BC combines cutting edge visual effects with stone-age storytelling. It has a few moments of (unintentional) hilarity, and provides limited entertainment. If you subscribe to the same Neanderthalic mentality as the film's subject matter (perhaps watch it after, or even during a night of heavy drinking) then there is some enjoyment to be gleaned, otherwise avoid  film-making has evolved way beyond the limits of this cumbersome beast.","10,000 BC"
178,limejockey,OK Early Summer Type Effects Picture,7,26 March 2008,"OK usually I don't get this crazy about comments, but I actually watched this picture and paid money for it so here goes. I liked it, not as an Oscar winning historical epic, which if you have ever watched any of the other Roland Emmerich movies you will know it will never even come close to that (anybody remember The Day After Tomorrow, Godzilla, INDEPENDENCE DAY!?!), but as an enjoyable piece of fluff with ridiculously large effects and a reasonably coherent story. It was not designed to be historically accurate, nor did it try to be. The acting was within the bounds of reason given what was there to be had. I didn't care that the Mammoths weren't around at that era or the weather wasn't properly set up or whether there weren't any pyramids at that time frame or whether mammoths were ever used as trained muscle to help build them or any of that stuff. I went in expecting the usual stuff that Mr Emmerich and Co usually deliver and was impressed with the visual show and reasonably impressed with the actors involved that they could even be noticed within a story of this size. I enjoyed it for what it was and hope you do too","10,000 BC"
179,jim-j-moore,Bland and dreary with a seedless climax,3,10 May 2008,"Films don't have to be historically accurate to be entertaining - but they do need to have at least one or two characters with some depth, a reasonable script and a plot to hold your attention. This film had none of these.The story develops so slowly that I had to consciously focus on the screen to prevent my attention wandering. It picks up a little more pace towards the end but not enough to offset the buttock numbing I endured for the one hour it took to get there. Even the fight scenes are somewhat antiseptic. I've seen more blood watching a Disney movie (although some of that may be my own).Visually the movie is a mixed bag. The non-computer generated cinematography was good, if not great. The CGI mammoths and the mix of CGI and live action for the panoramic scenes around the pyramids were OK but the sabre-toothed tiger was way too artificial...and that's probably what will stick in the mind of most people.The score was generic and forgettable...come to think of it, so was the acting! Plus the cheesy narration courtesy of Omar Sharif was mildly irritating. In summary, this was a film that disappoints, all the more so because it could and should have been much better.","10,000 BC"

My girlfriend promises one of them was a pacific islander. Also, everyone in the tribe was a teenager. What kind of tribe was this? I mean this sums up the entire movie right there- SLOPPY. The movie was clearly attempting to copy Apocolypto and spent mucho bucks in a blatant attempt at mimicry, yet I felt like I was watching some sort of college movie contest that didn't even place.

Definitely top 20. Is the director of this film somebody's f*#king cousin? Somebody used somebody's pull to make this film. I just don't understand how a script like this can be green-lighted, let alone made. Here's a few things I didn't like: 1. Every single scene in this movie has been done before... and by much better and more tasteful filmmakers. There were scenes directly mimicking Apocolypto, Braveheart, The Lord of the Rings, Dances With Wolves, 300, and much more Lord of the Rings... there wasn't one original idea in this entire film.2.The characterization ... well, there was no characterization. You didn't give a damn about anybody because they didn't spend any time developing characters. Everyone spoke perfect English.. (Which I'm willing to forgive, because subtitles on this already boring movie would have been torchure) but the name of the movie is 10000 BC and it's set in or around ancient Egypt. Perfect English in ancient Egypt is far fetched.3. The slaves who were being beaten and whipped, weren't beat up. They had great hygine and a great attitude, even a sense of humor.4. The bad guys weren't bad enough. They were pretty forgiving, gentle guys that had no business in any movie.5. After the lead characters chase after this gang of bad guys (stolen directly from Lord of the Rings when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli chase after the orcs who are taking the Hobbits to Isengard -- mixed with the Apocolypto slaves element) they all of the sudden, arrive at the pyramids being built. Wow. Didn't see that coming. Nobody did. No explanation... they are just there now. And the main character and his new army of natives (who follow him for no other reason other than they think he can talk to cats) storm the whole operation and kill the Egyptian king... or Pharaoh. Dude gets his girl back (his whole motivation for going on this journey in the first place) she gets killed.. an elephant looks at him.. he drops to his knees.. she comes back to life... they live happily ever after...the end. I wish I was being sarcastic, but this is exactly what happens.I'm tellin ya, save yourself the 8 bucks and go rent No Country for Old Men or Into the Wild. Or if you like this genre, rent Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, Apocolypto, 300, Dances With Wolves and maybe Spartacus. At least these films are worth your time. Now more than ever, people should be very critical of movies like this. There are so many other great films out there (millions of them) that we really shouldn't have time for things like 10,000 BC.","10,000 BC"
182,alan_v35,This bites like an ill-tempered dog....,3,9 March 2008,"Well, after creating an alien invasion in Independence Day and a giant monster in Godzilla, two things have become abundantly clear about writer/producer/director Roland Emmerich. He is very skilled at creating large-scale CGI spectacles, and he is the worst writer getting rich in Hollywood, today. It's hard to believe that this is the same mind that brought us the shallow, but very entertaining, Stargate. At least, in his previous projects, however, Emmerich was willing to lay out some cash to get his dumb lines delivered by professional stars with some skill and charisma. Not so here. The cast of 10,000 B.C. is largely made up of lost unknowns and untalented newcomers, with the exceptions of Cliff Curtis and narrator Omar Sharif (I've heard of him). The fitful acting is worsened by soap opera quality dialog and a story that belongs on Saturday morning cartoons. Even Emmerich's direction, which helped his earlier efforts seems tired and unimaginative, here. The manhattan Movie Maniac - Realmoviereview.comThe woeful, and historically-inaccurate, story (I won't even get started with that) of 10,000 B.C. starts out with a clan of mammoth hunters, living a Native-American inspired lifestyle. Their little world, which includes perfect use of all language concepts except contractions, is upset when a young, blue-eyed girl (Evolet) stumbles into their village and prompts their magical mystic (""Old mother"" - that's original) to fire out a doom filled prophecy. Aren't all prophecies doom filled? When was the last time anyone made a prophesy something bland, but pleasant? Anyway, the prophecy prompts the village's main hunter, and holder of some ridiculously prominent white spear, to abandon his son, and his clan, to go...go...I don't really know why he left, but he left. Some kind of plan to stop the prophecy, I guess. At any rate, he leaves his son, D' Leh, who grows up, falls in love with Evolet and becomes a leader. His world is turned upside down when a group of technologically advanced raiders show up and take Evolet, and others, captive. Now, D'Leh and a few companions have to rescue them, which involves crossing the great mountains, meeting new groups, stopping for cappuccino, etc. Okay, I made up the last part, but if they had, it wouldn't have made the story much more ridiculous than it already is. The wonderful CGI effects in 10,000 B.C. could not save this sorry effort from the blunt force trauma of my keyboard. Imagine Apocalypto, crossed with Quest for Fire and mixed together with Stargate, and you have 10,000 B.C., which is nowhere near as good as any of those films (and I didn't even like Quest For Fire that much). The usual crowd of easily-pleased action fans will like this one, and spout off with usual ""can't you just enjoy the movie"" kind of defense, but others should stay away from the shrapnel of this bomb. The CGI animals are cool to watch and they entertained me in a Jurassic Park 2, kind of way for awhile, but there wasn't even enough of that, so I was left to endure a story that is on a par with the efforts of a motivated eighth grader, disappointing performances from a cast that may improve one day, but I doubt it, and action direction that had all the imagination of an infomercial. If you catch trailer for this one, you have seen the best it has to offer. It only gets worse from there. 10,000 B.C. is the first major cinematic disappointment of 2008.","10,000 BC"
183,onelegobuilder,"A watchable nostalgic adventure, but it gets boring at the end",5,13 March 2008,"*MANY SPOILERS* I actually give it 5.5 out of 10 stars because I still found it entertaining up until the climax. Roland Emmerich who directed Godzilla, Independence Day, and the Day After Tomorrow, scores yet another box office blockbuster. But do the Visual Effects overpower the other crucial elements? The answer is a definite yes. Although the CGI is impressive it is greatly overdone. I had no idea there were ships and giant stone structures built during 10,000 B.C. And I found it very peculiar that the climate and terrain kept changing as the adventure continued. One minute the cavemen are in the snowy mountains, another there in a tropical jungle getting chased by ostrich-like creatures, and finally they appear in a wide desert where there are rivers and a whole other civilization. There is briefly a saber-tooth tiger but he is made toothless by the director, so no suspense there. The heroes speak English while their enemies speak an unknown language. Still it does work to know who's who.On the plus side the acting is good with charismatic performances by Steven Strait as D'leh, and Camille Belle as Evolet. Even for a dirty cave woman Evolet still looks like a gorgeous modern-day teenager. The most impressive part of the production is probably the stampede of mammoths and the panoramic shots in Australia. Plus the film is at a good pace so it won't drag on too long. It ended happily with the bad guys defeated, and D'leh and Evolet living happily ever after. But I got lost before the end, because an elderly woman back at camp was spiritually communicating with them and even feeling each others pain. You may go and see it if you liked One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch in a fur bikini. But don't expect anything innovative or coherent from 10,000 B.C.

Set in the time of woolly mammoths, sabre tooth tigers, moas and human subjugation this is a wonderful dramatization of life.Some may argue that the plot is nothing more than a series of rehash from a common narrative but it is so well executed you would give the similarities a miss to enjoy the movie. Like most of Emmerich's movies this great monumental feature is an achievement in its own right but nothing could match his first, Independence Day (1996), which had the right elements of body, mind and soul.However, despite politically challenged terminologies, inconsistencies, historical and geographical inaccuracies, this is still one movie to be watched on the big screen for the heck of it whether anything existed or not in that period. If not, we could always turn to One Million Years B.C. and watch Raquel do her thing or turn to the documentary channel to get the facts right.","10,000 BC"
191,Eternalkid,"10,000 SF, not BC! This is Science-Fiction!",1,8 September 2008,"If I could vote below a 1 out of 10, I would.I would give it a 0.5 out of 10 based solely on a decent-looking bird (Camilla Belle) and 3 special effects sequences containing the following: The ""Mammoth"" scene - those big woolly elephants that lived from the Pliocene epoch from 4.8 million years ago to around 4,500 years ago.The ""Gastornis"" scene - those over-sized carnivorous ostrich-like flightless birds that lived from 34 million years ago to around 100,000 years ago.The Sabre-toothed tiger (ludicrously over-sized in the film) scene - an overgrown ""big cat"" that lived between approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago.Those are ALL extinct fossilised species found in Europe, and South or North America.English-speaking man didn't really make it there until MAYBE 2,000 years ago.Given the attempt of the film to promote the fact that tribes of different people existed (most of which seemed at times African, at times Aboriginal in appearance), this falsehood just does not stand up.They'd have done better going the Mel Gibson, Apocalypto, way. That is, no English dialogue.But the ENTIRE film crumbles laughably when the pyramids in the desert concept is introduced.Fit of Laughter Number One: Pyramids, specially those that seem to be set (in the film) in Egypt, or near some desert's delta, did not come about until 2,600 BC. End of that little lie.Belly Cackle Number Two: The Woolly Mammoth depicted in this excuse for a film ONLY lived in Northern, and VERY COLD climates. It is unheard of as A) ever been found near a desert, as depicted in this trash, or B) ever being known to be even remotely domesticated by Man.Roland and his co-writer must have needed the cash.

Yup, the negative reviews are right on the money. This movie is plagued by weak dialogue (""we are tired, we sleep here?"") weaker characters (laughable old mother, Diva Plavalaguna ripoff...aww c'mon get real), and the weakest most predictable story (recycled from vastly superior Apocalypto, Mel should get a cut or an apology).The SP effects were inconsistent, needed more sabertooth (or even more ""cowbell"" for that matter...see how crazy this movie has made me) and what was with those laughable attack chickens (again another apology owed this time to Ice Age).Heck, even when D'Leh makes his big Leader speech to the tribes before the final battle, didn't we already see this scene in 1996 with President Whitmore declaring our Independence Day? Want more ripoffs...how about King Leonidas spear throw on Xeres? Seen it, seen it, seen it!!!Maybe Roland was paying tribute to the genre, but I seriously doubt it. Makes us miss Astronaut Taylor & Nova, heck even Beastmaster Dar & Kiri all did it so much better.Anyway the 1 star is for Evolet for teasing us throughout.After 2 hours the audience was groaning having endured 10000 clichés.And if you're thinking about waiting for the DVD, save your hard earned money because nothing can save this Mammoth Razzie!","10,000 BC"

It's very weak on every aspect of film making except CGI. Plot, Acting, Characters have all been marginalised to pay for CGI. So there is no real story or cool people. Not even a quote worthy of quoting anywhere. Even Independence day had that.But, the CGI is the great thing about about this movie.

195,darthmatthew-442-606491,At least it recycled...,3,21 August 2012,"At this point of my movie-watching history, I am reaching full capacity on several different genres of movies. In such genres such as action, adventure and fantasy, this means that fitting into the mold of the ordinary action movie will simply no longer cut it with me. One of these fantasy/action movies that I have seen recently falls into this category.10,000 B.C. followed the format without deviation, unfortunately to its demise. In fact, it fit so squarely into the ""I'll go to the end of the world to save you"" format, that I could've used a checklist to mark off each little cliché scene or character.Lets start off with the acting. Plain and simple, it was silly and cliché. It consisted of overly dramatic expressions, which was was unfortunately paired with the equally overdone dialogue. The actors spent the entire movie spitting out short, cheesy lines, and during the battle scenes the dialogue went even farther south, degrading to random grunts and battle cries. I especially cringed when the protagonist gave the dreaded pre-final-battle pep-talk. If I had watched 10,000 B.C. with subtitles, it would have looked something like this. ""RAH YAH YAAAH CHA RA WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH (babbling continues).""The story overall was very familiar. Guy who is kinda a nobody finally does something heroic and finally gets his chance to marry the girl of his dreams, but then all of a sudden she gets taken and then he goes and tries to get her back. Yay. Big whoop. On top of this were the utterly terrible characters. They were flat, boring, and cliché, and did not remotely support the story. They just trudged through the sloppy story for the mere point of trying to move the plot along. They had no involvement really in the story. It was as if the writer just grabbed some random names and attributes, and smashed them together to get the characters. All of the focus was put onto the events of the movie without any focus or work put into the characters-how amateur... Overall, 10,000 B.C. was a terrible movie. It was just like many action movies, containing a storyline that could've been written over a weekend, and characters that probably were made in about an hour. The only bright spot in the entire movie was the soundtrack, which was unfortunately lost over the sound of grunting, painfully bad dialogue, and incomprehensible blabbering of 10,000 B.C. It's so bad, I believe 10,000 B.C. might deserve a place in my ""least favorite 10 movies list"". I would like to thank 10,000 B.C. for taking a totally unoriginal storyline and republishing it with terrible characters and dialogue.10,000 B.C. is a movie older as its title.","10,000 BC"
196,antidonnie,Don't Waste Your Time,5,13 August 2008,"""The Legend. The Battle. The First Hero.""Frankly, this movie could have been much worse, and there aren't many ways this film could have been better. Because to do that you would have to completely rewrite the script, but not only in the story line but also in the dialogue. The story, as said by others, is too closely related to Apocalypto, which wasn't that great of a film, but not terrible. I don't know much about the history of the these tribes nor how their timeline is in anyway related to the pyramids and Wholly mammoths, and I don't really care to waste my time trying to find every little detail in how this film was historically incorrect. Not that it would be a big problem for me, because I believe with great care taken a film could be much better if the history was in some way twisted.The dialogue was an issue for me, not as much as a lot of other people, because I was mostly expecting it. It's sad because after I saw The Day After Tomorrow I knew that the director has little potential to be great. Not to mention that if he doesn't screen his movies for critics that means in his mind he knows that this not good movie. It's hard to believe a director would think just things, but then again why else would he do it?On one positive note, despite all the main characters speaking in English, the cast wasn't badly called. The main guy (Steven Strait) did a pretty good considering what character he was playing. The co-actors looked as though they belonged, but the girl (Camilla Belle) despite how beautiful she may be, had a harder time fitting in, but I really can't blame her for that.**/**** Stars10,000 BC (2008): Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action","10,000 BC"

Bad acting, bad plot, huge historical errors, corny dialogue, the list goes on. I never comment during a movie but man i had a lot to say during this movie. It was that bad. I laughed way to often, especially at the acting, and kept trying to figure out certain aspects. The sabortooth tiger is in the movie briefly, and is not aggressive or dangerous in this movie. The most vicious animal is some kind of killer ostridge if that makes any sense. It also throws in a cold clear environment for the main characters people, yet everyone else is African and the main scenes at the end are clearly in Egypt with the pyramids being built. This makes no sense because it gives the viewer the perception these people crossed the Andes to steal people from Europe to bring them to Egypt to build the pyramids. Does that make any sense!!!???

198,Grumpypheasant,The epic that just wasn't.,4,3 January 2011,"This movie tries. It tries to be epic. Sadly, only Harald Kloser's score even manages to make a credible attempt.Anachronisms run amok (the ""terror birds"" - Gastornis - had been extinct for millions of years when men first appeared), so do clichés and dei ex machinae seem to have been holding a convention on the set during filming.Yet, the movie isn't completely without interest: the CGI is very palatable and the action scenes are quite enjoyable, if too scarce and, in the french dub at least, the dialogue and narration are in fact pretty decent.This movie tries to be ""300"" in an earlier setting, but falls very short of the mark.","10,000 BC"
199,LordDynamo,"Prehistorical, but in some cases, prehysterical",6,7 July 2011,"Being an ENORMOUS fan of prehistory, I was dying to watch this film ever since it came out. I eventually watched it and was, well, surprised...though in a mixed way. Basically, it is about a mammoth hunter (who must be made reduntant most of the time if they hunt one a year) who must save his tribe from a bunch of horsemen (yes, horsemen, in prehistoric times!) who took them as slaves for their colony. Amongst the captured is the hunter's beloved, all the more reason to spend the next 2 hours of the film journeying to rescue the tribesmen. Before I go to the cons (which, sadly, outnumber the pros), I must say I praise the ideas in the film, especially the ""White Spear"" concept. And some of the action scenes are great, my favourites being the mammoth hunt (it doesn't reach ""Walking with Beasts"" level, but it's great all the same) and the terror bird attack. Right, now for the cons: -despite being in a prehistoric era, the hero and his tribe speak perfect English. Not in a primitive fashion, they speak like the Queen. Now I'm not usually a fussy person, but I would have preferred that they could have a particular dialect with subtitles, like the enemy tribe. -the enemy tribe use technology that wouldn't have been founded until the iron age. This film is presumably set in the early stone age, yet some are riding horses, using boats, etc. -geographical inaccuracies. If it were a trilogy or similar, the environment jumping would make more sense. But no, we start off in an Alpine landscape with snow capped mountains, then we find ourselves in an Amazon rainforest type place and finally the Sahara Desert. -the Egyptian/Atlantean people use mammoths to pull the pyramid stones. One, mammoths would never have been domesticated and two, how can the mammoths not die of heat when they're in the desert? -I was a bit disappointed by the sabre-tooth part, they put it on a poster fighting the hero, though we only see it for about 5 minutes in the film, no fighting included. On an additional, historical note, sabre-toothed cats died out long before the year 10000 BC.The cons put aside, I give this film a 6 for the action and ideas put in and I am ready to watch this film a couple more times.","10,000 BC"
200,Mudbug711,The more things change..........,5,10 March 2008,"As I entered the theater this afternoon, which had a good crowd already there, along with the very loud talking 6 year old boy, for some strange reason was brought by his parent(s), knowing that this feature film would not keep this child interested until there was nothing but large animal scenes. I say that about the people who moan, whine, cry, and complain about this movie. Just like they did when it came to Godzilla. ""Not enough monster, wah, wah, wah"". Godzilla was not a great movie, nor was it a bad one either. My opinion that is.... Now 10,000 B.C. from what I watched was very well put together movie. I did hear from the beer belly critics that they were peeved about the trailer 'supposedly' showed more saber-toothed tiger, and they griped about the love story. One that is not bad either. I will put it to all of you in a very easy way. I will not tell you it is a movie that you NEED to go see, or a movie NOT to see.. that is not my position in life. I am not a god, nor a deity, nor a goa'uld. I am an equal just like you. I will say that I enjoyed it, and so did the folks I went to see the movie with. 3 males, and 4 females.

Aside from the utterly ridiculous time-crossing and locations of the ancient creatures (exactly how long do you expect a Woolly Mammoth to survive in Egypt's desert?) And what were Mammoths doing around the time of semi-civilized man, considering they died out ~60,000 years ago... Did the writer / director forget the name of their own movie? And, ummm, predatory ostriches? Then there's the geography... Let's just hop from what seems like Northern Europe to Central Africa, won't take too long... And backtrack to Egypt - to continue the the stupidest love-interest story in the history of film.And beyond all those ""technical inaccuracies"" - the acting is atrocious, the writing is pathetic, the green-screening is amongst the worst I've seen this decade - regardless of budget, and there isn't a single likable character in the whole mess.Like I said, this is a movie that refuses to makes jokes of itself when it's obviously needed, therefore, (at least I think) is trying to be good & serious...

202,Sternicus,I may not have gotten a good history lesson but I did learn something about race.,7,16 March 2008,"First off lets start with the obvious it was not historically accurate it was historically inspired. The film is not meant to be a text book on how early humans lived but rather a sugar coated popcorn movie based on the idea. It was enjoyable for the time that it lasted. Bottom line it's just supposed to be fun. There probably were no giant birds; at least not that size, or saber toothed tigers that were the size of hippos, let alone being actual tigers. (Sabre toothed tigers were actually saber toothed cats, not tigers, and there was no species that was the size of a limo.) Viewers will have the choice on whether to let the inaccuracies get to them or to simply enjoy it based on the entertainment value.One thing I did learn from the film was the contemporary feel on race relations and human origin. The main characters in this movie did not have white skin but did have somewhat Anglo-Saxxon facial features. The hero of this movie had the appearance of what we stereotypically picture in our minds when we think of a early hominid; strong build, dark skin, long hair, and a small beard. He forms an alliance with African tribes men, the leader of which is almost identical to him in the fact that both he and D'Ley have missing loved ones that were taken by the pillaging horde of horse riders, he even looks like what we stereotypically think of when we think of early African humans who were first to evolve out of ape form (no offense) and launch the beginning of the human species. The reason why the main characters have the least amount of distinguishing features that sets them apart from being average is because the creators of films don't want their main characters to look too special, being the idea that they are normal people chosen to do a monumental task. Which would explain why the creators did not choose one of the African humans to be the hero. It's because then it might side track the audience in to viewing it some what as a ""black film"" , because the character has some thing that sets him apart from the status quo. I don't believe that the film makers are intentionally trying to be racist, it seems more like some thing they carry with them in their subconscious. This is shown by the mystical prophecy surrounding the ""girl with the blue eyes"". It couldn't have been something more to the point of pink-reddish eyes, or white eyes it had to be BLUE! Which every one knows is a Anglo-Saxxon characteristic. DOES ANY BODY SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS?! The film had a subconscious biased view of race which is something that many people carry deep with in themselves. The reason the mystic child had blue eyes was because Nordic humans did and nowadays sometimes still do have that presence of being divine. Even the Egyptians in this movie thought so! Why else would they bow down to that pale faced guy who view them as being so inferior that they were forbidden to look at him. It isn't until D'Ley kills him with a spear that it is revealed that he is not a god. It could also be said that this is the film makers way of foreshadowing human history. It's almost as if to say that in the years to come white hominids will come to other lands claiming to be superior to all other hominids, and that we are to follow this characters example and not to be fooled by their self righteous show of power.The ending of this movie is also a obvious cliché'. When the blue eyed girl dies and is brought back telepathically by the sacrifice made by the witch woman who lived in the mountains thousands of miles away. One may ask why the ending would have to be that cheesy. Why couldn't the girl had just toughed it out after getting shot with the arrow? Why did she have to die and then come back? The reason for this seems that if the girl had toughed it out that it would mean that there was something special about her. That she was stronger than most women who would get shot with an arrow. The main character can not be too special, remember? For them it was just better that she die and a then some weird tribal witch lady bring her back. For some reason films about subject matter having to do with old human civilizations always need to have some prophecy in the back ground. Apocalipto did too. It's just an old Hollywood cliché' and it is this films collection of them that will cost it a higher rating on this site, on this review and by other critics alike.","10,000 BC"
203,practicallypeach,God Awful...,2,23 April 2008,"And I mean it. You start off with this guy who's in love with this girl at age 6. And for no reason, too. It's not like they played and grew to like each other. This love just grows out of no where. That is one thing about this movie. Everything that has no purpose and isn't explained is automatically due to 'the prophecy'. Why do they love each other? Because it's in the prophesy. Why'd the girl come back to life after so many people wanted her dead? Prophesy. You will get a lot of that here.I do get upset when I seek the main character and his 'girl friend' because they are white people painted brown. I know there are LOADS of people of color with better acting talent that would have loved to get those parts. But they go to white people with sloppy accents and terrible acting skills. You've got this annoying 'tag-a-long' boy who insists on following our hero. He never contributes. He's just...there. The plot was typical. Girl is kidnapped and the guy sets out to rescue her. I guarantee you that if that girl had been left behind but everyone else was kidnapped, the tribe would have cut their loses and moved on. Because of this, you can't even identify with the main character. He's a coward. He lacks bravery and concern for others EXCEPT for his blue eyed prize. Idiot. Everything is pretty much laid right in front of you. You know what's going to happen. And you know how it's going to happen. And since you don't like ANY of the characters, there is really no one to root for. Oh and the tribe men are hunters and gatherers. Why do they have 6 packs? Hunters and gatherers didn't do the kind of things that gave a man a 6 pack. If you look at people today who live as hunters and gathers, you see that they are in NO way shaped in this way. So not only are these people white but also have Hollywood bodies. I guess when all you're trying to create is eye candy, historical accuracy means little. And their finger nails were very clean, too. It's a bad movie. Don't see it. Don't buy it.","10,000 BC"

As someone pointed out, it wasn't meant as a documentary. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, because I went in expecting much worse. The following is written with tongue-firmly-in- cheek. 10,000 BC has traditionally been thought of as the time when ""all the cool stuff happened"": Conan's Hyborian Age, the Great Flood, the sinking of Atlantis, etc. I think, maybe I should write hope, that this may be the reason for the incredible historical inaccuracies, the writers were just having fun. All in all,it was very silly, but fairly entertaining. I do agree with several of the other reviewers, recommendations follow some of the comments. Yes, the characters should have spoken in something other than Hollywood English. Drop the articles, pronouns, something, but please, no subtitles, let's keep that for actual foreign movies. Yes, I agree that the ""love"" between D'Leh and the Blue-Eyed chick was incredibly bland and the fact that she ""stayed pure"" for her man was highly unlikely, you want realism circa 10,000 BC, rent ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" FYI- be prepared for a rape scene about every 6 minutes.

208,symmachos,A Great Old-Fashioned Saturday Matinée,8,9 March 2008,"The caveman epic is a neglected film genre. The trailer for this movie led me to expect something like ""Walking With Cavemen,"" that excellent BBC documentary of 2003 (except with more drama & violence) or ""Quest for Fire,"" a still more excellent feature film of 1981 (except with better mammoths).But despite a title that recalls two previous caveman attempts  the rather laughable ""One Million B.C."" from 1940, and the still more laughable ""One Million Years B.C."" from 1966 (that one starred Raquel Welch and her two most marketable assets)  ""10,000 B.C."" is actually straight-up science fiction. And that's not a bad thing at all.This movie has plenty of action, plenty of CGI, gorgeous location photography from Africa and New Zealand, a durable quest narrative, and a hunky leading man in the form of Steven Strait, self-doubting mammoth hunter. The producers make some nice gestures toward Ice Age realism with their portrayal of the encampment of the mammoth hunters, who have cool dreadlocks (like most folks in prehistoric movies nowadays), cool face paint, fancy bone weapons & jewelry, and appropriately furry garments.There's a lot that the producers get wrong, period-wise. Ice Age hunters didn't live in large groups, they didn't live in permanent villages, and they certainly didn't spend the winter up in the mountains (duh). The mammoth-hunting techniques that we see seem highly dubious also. Still worse, the scenario is geographically challenged - there's no way anyone could walk from alpine mountains to East Asian bamboo jungles to sub-Saharan Africa over the course of a few weeks.Most annoying to Anglophone viewers will probably be the funny accents. I mean, we all know that nobody spoke English ten thousand years ago, and we're all very comfortable with the convention of portraying cinematic Romans and Spartans (not to mention hobbits and elves!) as speaking English instead of their true languages. So what not have Delay & his people just talk like ordinary Americans? Instead they're given this silly Middle Eastern/Middle European accent that sounds like bad Middle-1960s dubbing.But that's a small quibble. The most important point here is that ""10,000 B.C."" is really a homage to the pulp adventures published in ""Weird Tales"" during the 1920s and 1930s. In this film we're very much in the territory of Robert E. Howard (author of the Conan stories) and Edgar Rice Burroughs (creator of Tarzan, Barsoom, and the lost world of the cavemen ""At the Earth's Core""). Because once the story gets rolling, we discover that the mammoth hunters have predatory neighbors whose technology (horseback riding, bows and arrows, sailing ships, woven cloth, monumental architecture in dressed stone) is thousands of years ahead of theirs.""Some say they came from the stars, or from a land that sank beneath the sea."" Aha! What we have here is a lost colony from Atlantis. Exactly the kind that Howard and Burroughs and their many Depression-era imitators loved to write about. Once the Atlantis thing kicks in, you know that evil priests, false gods, ancient prophecies, human sacrifice, and a slave rebellion are all in store. (See ""Atlantis, the Lost Continent"" (1961) for more of what I'm talking about.) And in this regard ""10,000 B.C."" does not disappoint.In the end this film resembles nothing so much as an unauthorized prequel to ""Stargate."" It's a great Saturday matinée.","10,000 BC"

Sorry folks, but if your really wanting to see this one, best wait till the DVD. Or, if you really want to see it...it will be online for free in a matter of days. There were some above average scenes, but overall...no.","10,000 BC"

After a hunter's lover is captured, he must track down the people who eventually force her to be a slave, along with other people of her tribe. Take a good look at the cover, that is the only violent the the Sabertooth tiger (speartooth) does. One of the most disappointing things in the movie were the fact that nothing was really explained. This movie actually reminded me of Pathfinder, the dialogue, romance, and more. Overall the movie was mediocre and there could have been major improvements.","10,000 BC"
211,callahan-patrick,"Worst film of the 2008, hands-down",1,17 June 2009,"Let me a tell a true horror story. My friend and I had went to a real decadent theater near his house, we were bored and thought ""O.K, this film looks good."" The next we know we are dying in our seat from start to finish, it was 109 minutes too long. Now, I'm not saying ""dying"" as in laughing hysterically, but ""dying"" as in actually dying. My brain cells were being disintegrated and my heart rate went down very low. It also is excruciating to watch. I came out of the theater 10,000 times dumber with a frown on my face and a lighter wallet. The only pro of the movie was the visual effects, which I had to admit were at least decent. I should have listened to my other friend, who said it was awful, but I figured ""how bad could it be?"" This was incorrect thinking on my part. There was a brief moment of intelligence in the film, that was completely erased a couple minutes later. I only sat through the whole thing because I knew that if I could sit through ""Hostel II"" and the remake of ""Halloween,"" I could survive this. Still, the one thing I don't understand is how Mr. Emmerich could screw up so bad. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and especially ""Independence Day"" were fantastic and then he comes up with ""10,000 BC,"" in which my two thoughts throughout the film were ""Where did you go wrong, Roland?!"" and ""I want to punch Mr. Emmerich in the head for helping create this disaster."" My warning to all is this ""STAY AWAY"" and spend money on something worthwhile. Buy your wife a ring with that money saved up and forget you even thought about putting yourself through physical torture.","10,000 BC"

Compared to other ""adventure"" films it has no silly jokes, no dumb love story without depth and no explosions. Its just a pure and fine adventure movie with some fantasy elements.I think the acting was pretty good and sure the dialogs are not sharp as in other movies, but hey: they come from the mouth of tribesmen, so the dialogs are exactly how they should be.I like this film very much since it is reduced to a true adventure story. Its really relaxing to see a movie with a story for adults. No impossible stunts, no silly Hollywood jokes that try to cover a bad story. Pure adventure in a fantastic prehistoric world.The CGI is wonderful because I never had the feeling there is CGI involved. The soundtrack is amazing, a real masterpiece.If you like mature adventure films you will like this film. If you like Indy 4 or other silly crap whit impossible stunts, silly jokes and no blood at all, then better stay away.","10,000 BC"
213,jean-sebas,Good and different,8,23 October 2020,"Okay, so there are a lot of mixed reviews here! Sometimes I trust them and others I don't. I had already seen this as a teen, and wanted to see it again and see if I'd still like it. I thought it was very good and to me different than other movies, given the protagonists are ""cavemen"", or ""mountainmen"" in this case. Some here say there was nothing new in this movie, well we don't watch the same movies then... I mean, your common archetypes are there but this takes place in the ancient/prehistoric world. Now, for those crying about historical inaccuracies... You do are aware that this is a *movie *, right? Not a documentary... Have you never heard you must suspend disbelief? The story is consistent in what it tells, that's all that matters. It creates a world and presents it to you. When a movie contradicts its own rules, that's when it fails.Someone here said the part where they need to find the head of the snake (symbols, so not spoilers), why did they not just follow the snake instead of the way they chose? Well, they say it in the movie my man, it's a shortcut! They didn't have the means to follow the snake...To me this was a different movie, with the mountainmen's and others' spiritualities and yet also the challenging of superstitions, the presentation of different cultures, all the interesting fighting and action scenes; honestly I thought it was great! There also are some breathtaking landscapes in this film. I liked it even more as an adult than as a teen. I also thought the sage's narrating created a nice atmosphere consistent with the movie's themes.Then again, everyone must make their own minds.","10,000 BC"

I was at the Egyptian Pyramids of Giza last week and the presence of them in the film was pleasing.

Was it just so they could use the extinct animals? I'm sure we could have coped with rampaging elephants and lions instead. If they'd called it 3,000 BC and left it at that, I'm sure people would have been happier with it.The change in landscape was bizarre too - they lived on some kind of mountain range and walked through the snow to the tropics in the space of a couple of nights..........no temperate climate, no woods, no grassy slopes, just snow then palm trees - very odd.I liked the idea, I liked the epic mission part and the little love story, I liked the scenery, the different tribes, the freeing of slaves, the bringing down the bad guy, the visions of Ancient Egypt in the making and I even liked the CGI beasts .............just not all at the same time!If a person watched this film with a totally open mind, knowing that it wasn't supposed to be even slightly historically correct, then I think they might enjoy it - also if they'd set it on a different planet or fantasy world with beasts we never had here and monuments that we weren't familiar with, then I think we could have coped, unfortunately I think that attempting to set it somewhere in Earth's history was a big mistake","10,000 BC"
217,MrRazorz,"Mammoths built the pyramids. No, really.",3,28 March 2008,"How do you make a film like 10,000 BC? Start by mashing together Clan of the Cave Bear and The Scorpion King, toss in bits and pieces of Gladiator, Apocalypto, 300 and even a smidge of Stargate, extract any semblance of characterization, plot or decent dialogue, add plenty of CGI mammoths, overcook for 109 minutes, and serve while hanging your head in shame.I mean, I'm all for a bit of prehistoric fantasy, and I don't mind a film tossing plausibility and historical accuracy to the winds as long as it's entertaining, but this was just baaaaad.Our story (and I use the term loosely) opens with a primitive clan of dreadlock-wearing mammoth hunters finding a strange blue-eyed girl (Camilla Belle) who's apparently the sole survivor of a massacred tribe. Naturally she becomes the focus of a cryptic prophecy involving one of the young men of the clan (Steven Strait), who later wins her hand in marriage after single-handedly bringing down a mammoth. Shortly afterwards they're raided by ""four-legged demons"" (armoured men on horseback) who kidnap half the tribe, including the girl. Her stone-age beau sets off to rescue her with the help of his wise old mentor (Cliff Curtis, who really should have known better) and ends up on an eventfully silly journey through Europe and North Africa, encountering various other loincloth-wearing cultures along the way and uniting them against their common enemy - an anachronistic pre-Egyptian cult led by a crazy mask-wearing god-king. Had enough?An absolutely abysmal film from start to finish, 10,000 BC is only watchable at all due to some well-crafted special effects (the mammoths are actually pretty cool), one half-decent battle scene at the end, and a lot of unintentional laughs.Avoid.","10,000 BC"

I still would have it a 3 because there's no particular drama to it.I am looking forward to the DVD.

219,stuartdr,Prehistoric tragedy,2,7 March 2008,"When I walked into the theater for the midnight showing, I was tired and I didn't think I would be able to sit through it without falling asleep. However, the trailer did look interesting enough and I wanted to check it out. It turned out to be quite a mess of a film.Let's begin with some of the good points of the film. First,some of the cinematography shot was extremely well done. They had a nice epic Lord of the Rings type feel to it and it felt like it fit well with the movie. Also, some of the actions sequences were well choreographed although they tend to not last very long. Also I really like Cliff Curtis playing as a mentor named Tic Tic. I liked him in both Live Free Die Hard and Sunshine and I'm glad he was able to save some parts of the film.The plot...is very clichéd. Take Apocalypto and switch some things around and what you have is basically 10,000 BC. The film is about a mammoth hunter who struggles for status in the village. However after a girl with blue eyes comes to the village, the village is pillaged by what seems to be nomadic tribes. Similarly to Apocalypto, he goes on a journey to get his love interest back. The story have ridiculous amounts of loop holes and is very very predictable.Acting for the most part is mediocre and the many recurring characters are unbearably annoying. Many of the characters act stiffly and blurts out cheesy lines that has been said in so many other movies. I didn't mind the main actor although he had some very cheesy lines. However, the lack of professional actors was decided probably because they isn't much dialogue to begin with and the director wanted to create ""realism"".The special effects both help and hurt the film. many times there is such an contrast between the foreground (the characters) and the background that it is very obvious that it was done on poor blue screening. Also the creatures are overall doesn't look impressive. They didn't look very real and many creatures they brought into the film was rather ridiculous (Such as a carnivorous ostrich turkey). Although the close up shots (for example when you see the character and the feet of the mammoths) looked quite a bit better and made it more believable.The main concern with the film is the absolute lack of historical accuracies. Yes I have seen on the board that it is a movie and that it should not be considered very highly. Although I respect that opinion, the film did not even keep up with a bearable amount of accuracy so that the film doesn't look absurd. There were so many scenes, where the theater was howling with laughter. The film mish mashes pyramids, villages, ships, mammoths, saber-tooth tigers and bandits all into a confusing film that doesn't seem to know where time period they are in.The ending was by far one of the worst I have seen. Although I will not spoil it, after spending 2 hours watching a film where there is so little explained, don't expect to receive a fulfilling ending at the end. I must say, as of right now, 10,000 BC is my least favorite film of the year. It is long, clichéd, absurd mess that doesn't give much enjoyment or excitement.","10,000 BC"

I'm a total fool.It's miserable on so many levels. I was at least expecting a CGI bonanza, but there wasn't much there (lots of mammoths, a saber toothed cat (for 2 mins) and an emu/raptor thing (for 1 min)). Pathetically weak story, dismal acting, poorly directed action sequences, ... I really cannot think of a single saving grace. Oh yeah - the blue eyes chick looked good (and had a ready supply of make up 12000 years ago).What happened to this guy? Independence day was great fun.

I even bothered to write a review about it, because as i've said, i liked it.

Had I realized earlier, I would never associate myself with the producers of this movie.Now it's only that I realized that the movie was just plain awful. I wish to forget the instances when I felt a terrible pain enduring the flow of the movie. Although the landscapes were a spectacle to the eyes, deep inside I was in a very agonizing experience.Roland Emmerich's other films were really not that good.

222,raven_1-1,Not bad,5,20 August 2009,"This film has generated a lot of adverse reviews, mainly because the film makers did not show the reviewer's expert vision of pre-history (gasp!). The film successfully mixes up cultures, geography and legends to bring an adventure story to our screens that may not be Jason and the Argonauts but still manages to entertain if it is accepted for what is is...........a fantasy film! I won't repeat the story line but it makes no less sense than (e.g.) Star Wars, though the dialogue and acting is not particularly polished, and the CGI, excluding the Sabre Toothed Tiger, is most acceptable in the main.Many have criticised the use of English as the main medium of communication between the characters and the audience. So what if other languages had been spoken then. Do we know them? Would Gladiator have been a better film if Russell Crowe had spoken Latin? There seems to be some double standards here, though I accept than many people with a modern education may not have advanced much beyond the ""Ugh Ugh"" stage themselves.A common complain is the use of good English in the film; that is, no modern slang/colloquiums. If proper English is used then more people from around the globe will be able to understand the dialogue. People have also complained of British accents.....well I am English and never heard a single British accent in the film!! Some reviewers have suggested that the film would have been better (and presumably more authentic as the same reviewers complained of historical inaccuracies) if the characters had spoken like Americans! Yes, that would have worked..............the hero talking of the killer-birds: ""those darn pesky critters are gonna get their asses' wupped!!"" or the hero ordering as he leaves the tribe ""Mammoth burger to go, heavy on the mayo"".Suspend your disbelief and give it a go; its just mindless entertainment that can be enjoyed during a relaxing evening.","10,000 BC"

Compared to what most people said I think most people are just wrong. The movie also had pretty decent acting, even though I'm more of an action fan then an acting fan. Believe it or not I actually saw this movie TWICE, it was so good. These days people just don't appreciate good action and special effects.

I thought it was very obvious even based on the previews that it is in no way intended to depict history as it actually happened. This is a movie firmly rooted in pulp traditions and really should be approached from a similar perspective to superhero movies. It's epic, but comic book style epic.

The story never became predictable, the visuals were enjoyable all throughout and I did not cringe at any of the dialogues or the acting for that matter although both were kind of basic but hey, it was a prehistoric time after all remember, and I have to admit I cried real tears when .. Nah I'm not gonna tell you that yet! are you kidding me. The whole production had a pleasant warmth and friendliness to it, like in olden times, when people still had a heart and cared for each other, instead of preying on something twisted or shocking. I guess that's what you guys have been missing? That means evolution did a bad job and now you're just too numb to enjoy anything if bloody body parts are not slapping you in the face.. So, perfect feel good movie for a night with the girlfriend or your family and totally made to watch on a large screen.

I was bored with the ABSOLUTE HORRIBLE acting and couldn't understand why I was watching interracial cavemen with dreadlocks that spoke English. The makeup was awful and the story line was worst. I know that ACTIONS are the reasons for film, but in this film, everything that was ACTED was also said as if the audience had a first grade comprehension level. OH! This film was also a knock off from Apacalypto (ps. Mel Gibson, this looks like a law suite). But one hundred million times worst. The direction was absolutely bizarre. There clearly was NO vision. After sitting in the theater for 45 minutes hoping, wishing, and praying it would get better, My Husband and I went to the front counter and ASKED for our MONEY back.

If you actually want to see what life was like in 10000 BC, watch some anthropology documentaries about primitive tribes around the world. They still live much as mankind did twelve thousand years ago.I prefer to think of 10000 BC as one of a glorious old genre - the caveman movie. As such, it's more realistic than 1 Million Years BC, not as realistic as Quest For Fire, and at least it doesn't have Darryl Hannah in it.It is a poor film, worthy only of a five, due to its rubbish script and questionable acting.

Cool!"" should be approached with the same caution as active nuclear material or nocturnal rodents.I don't know that ""dreck"" is strong enough a word to describe this waste of time. At the outset, ""10,000 B.C."" seems harmless enough, perhaps even interesting, except that the time and place are merely backdrops to be used and abused in this wretched story-telling. Once the raiding party shows up, any hope of historical relevancy becomes as extinct as the woolly mammoth.There are problems galore with this movie. Where are we? Someplace snowy and mountainous, obviously northern, where the mammoth are plentiful and people dress in fur. Then we're dragged from the snowy mountains through a jungle populated by giant, angry ostrich-looking birds, then out into the desert to be brought as slaves to work on the Pharoah's construction projects. From the mountainous snowy north to the flat dry desert south without having to cross any major body of water AND with jungle in between. WHERE are we? Nevermind the obvious problems with inconsistencies with the use of iron (the Iron Age began in 12,000 BC for some peoples, as late as 6,000 BC for others), shipbuilding and construction - WHAT ON EARTH ARE MAMMOTHS DOING AS PACK ANIMALS FOR CONSTRUCTING THE GREAT PYRAMID?!?! Doesn't Emmerich understand that, in America, if it even appears to be fact-based (mammoths were real, the Egyptians were real, the pyramids are still real) it IS fact-based, because too many of us are too tired, lazy or bored to pick up a reference book? So, then, one wonders - what the hell did they make this movie for? What was the point? Guess the old guy-wants-girl, guy-loses-girl, guy-beats-tiger, guy-kills-bad-guy, guy-gets-girl story needed some dressing up in fake fur, fake bone and really, really bad haberdashery. Emmerich could have set this thing in any time period against any backdrop and done far less damage than he did here. This thing is a work of contempt - contempt for the average film-goer's intelligence and contempt for the story writing process. Razzies all around! Wanna see a better movie on life in prehistorical times? Catch Ringo Starr in ""Caveman"" or Raquel Welch in ""One Million Years B.C."" - they may not be any more historically accurate, but they are eminently more watchable movies.

The special effects are stunning and all of the actors played their roles very well, I can say. The only (tiny small) thing I found annoying was the white teeth. Too white I must say!

I have to admit, for the creators of Independence Day, Godzilla, Eight Legged Freaks and the Day After Tomorrow, this film was actually disappointing. All their other films have a paranormal event that takes place with interesting characters who are attractive in their own ways. Although a couple of their stories are ridiculous, it is the concept and ingenuity that will often grant their films praise.This film, however, was quite frankly, sloppy. There was absolutely no depth to any of the characters, whom in account of this, garnered no emotional attachment from the theatrical audience. Also, the fantasy element was quite absurd. Say that the planet was not our own planet and/or was in another dimension. In this case, it is safe to say that the creators would need a planet with no definable weather patterns, ie. 20 miles of frozen lands, neighboring 20 miles of forest lands, neighboring a desert.I am giving this title a 5-star rating, on account of the creators and the hope that they will do better next time.","10,000 BC"

Also the giant ostrich-like creatures that attack the people on their journey WAS a real prehistoric beast that DID live at the same time as humans- it's called ""the elephant bird"" scientific name ""apiornus Maximus"" I KNOW cause I did a report in school on them as my dad owned a rare eggshell fragment from one!!I thought the acting in this was very well done and moving. As far as the languages yes I agree with other reviewers - SO many human languages are completely extinct - this period in history is not documented by the written word only cave paintings.

The story is so dull, there's no plot, just loose clichés tied together. Commando has better character development. The ending is so laughable it's not even funny...Honestly I hoped at least the special fx would be good, but guess what...apparently Emmerich though it would be a good idea to hold off the big, epic scenes for the last battle, but by then the anticlimactic effect of this mess is so overwhelming you won't even notice anything. Not that there's much to notice...a bunch of mammoths running around for about 2 minutes. There's no blood to keep it all PG, so there's not even one good scene in the last battle. Even when the main dude was supposed to get all badass and kick the bad guy's ass, he actually shoves a bone in his chest, and we don't get to see anything except a vague, dumb stare. Seriously, dudes...keep away, at all costs.","10,000 BC"

I love Apocalypto. I think it is a great movie but if you go to see 10,000 BC please don't compare it to Apocalypto, you will make the biggest mistake in your entire movie watching life.But if you need to get out of this harsh life, if you need to see a different kind of romantic movie than the usual chick flick, than please go and see this move. I think is a beautiful story. It is well done compared to what to budget was for this movie.

Just shut off all your bodily functions besides hand and mouth movement (you'll be needing those to eat popcorn), sit back and enjoy two hours of mindless blockbuster fun on a rainy Sunday afternoon.The only reason I'm writing this comment is to deliver my message to Hans Zimmer, former film score composer genius: Dear Mr. Zimmer, if you ever read this; please stop cheating your fans by copying & pasting from your former work and calling it a new soundtrack! I mean, the Gladiator soundtrack was pretty good (I even own the cd). Pirates was pretty much Gladiator. King Arthur was also Gladiator (but with a bit of Enya thrown in for good measure). And 10.000 BC is ... Gladiator! Only this time -yes, I must admit the sheer brilliance is overwhelming- with a bit of King Arthur in the mix! Kudos Mr. Zimmer, kudos.Does anyone else feel cheated?

Up until then, me and my friends were giggling, but that scene we couldn't hold it in any longer. What a jip! I wanted my money back. Why is it that almost everyone spoke English (with an accent) except the wise old man from the other side of the mountain? When did the gang land on the Lost island and the most ferocious thing the writers could come up with was a flock of maniacal ostriches? This movie was so full of inconsistencies. Independence Day may have been inconsistent, but at least it was entertaining and the talent held our attention, unlike this bad joke of a movie. This did NOT live up to my 11 year old's expectations, much less mine. What a mess! I'd rather have watched Showgirls.","10,000 BC"
238,Oroncz,Ronald Emmrich's last chance,1,8 March 2008,"As a fan of b-movies, I like to watch and enjoy ridiculous writing and poor acting but I can't believe Mr.Emerich(dir)disappoints even there.10,000 b.c tells a story...Let me rephrase that, try's to bring a story of an ancient tribe that by a prophecy is about to face a test of survival and this plot is shown through the eyes of two lovers who at the end brings back hope to the tribe.Now let's say that we accept this unimaginative plot just to try and enjoy the movie, but for some unthinkable reason, though the story is very much simple and less then childish there is a narrator telling the story so that we can understand what has already been seen? And what we did see was not interesting at all...OK, so they didn't think the story through, but if you want to come and see a movie packed with visual effects you will not get that either. A few special effects on the movie are really good(accept for the sabretooth)but they fill the screen only for a few minutes and again, there is no script to fill the very long rest of the movie.I'd say something about the actors, but I felt that there was no director on set to guide anyone, it was as if he gave up from the beginning and just wanted all this to end.So in the end, I do not recommend to waste your time on this one, if you do like to see the art of special effects just wait for the DVD.Shimeck scale: waste of time","10,000 BC"

Of course, that historically it could be wrong, but is it fact-based movie? I think, that, if we won't look at history, the film is quite good. For me - it's a light to watch, full of action, movie. Special effects are not bad, too (maybe a little more blood would do fine). I wasn't watching this film with purpose to rate special effects. All I wanted, was to see a good movie.

240,julien-52,Chariot of the Gods?,5,6 March 2008,"First off, the trailer is incredibly misleading. This isn't so much an action-adventure as a hero's journey, and a historically inaccurate one at that. Not that I should have expected careful research - this is Roland Emmerich after all - but I thought he might do a Jean-Jacques Annaud, and give us ""QUest for Fire"" part deux. Nope. This is a very strange film, indeed. Everyone speaks perfect English, they walk for several days and enter a completely different climate zone, and we see ziggurat-pyramids about 8,000 years before they were actually constructed. I think Emmerich was either on peyote or he believes ""Chariots of the Gods."" On the plus side, the film has Cliff Curtis, who's the best thing since sliced bread, and some really cool CGI woolly mammoths and a sabertooth tiger. And the lead actor is attractive. That's about it.","10,000 BC"

The plot is an old one, repeated many many times that you could tell what will happen through this movie since the beginning, the young man who follows the young girl and discovers that he's a hero through his journey to save her and they live happily ever after, didn't you hear that before? Even if that was the only plot that holds this movie, i would've given it 3 stars...but I must tell that the director Roland Emmerich couldn't let his movie be a moderate one, it must be very very VERY bad that no one could enjoy it....We must add some terrible historical mistakes, get some so bad actors, give them a very bad make up, get the worst cinematographer ever so that no one can follow the action sequences, and yeah, we must resemble the movie ""300"" in all the ending details of the movie, cause that was a good action flick..The only good thing this movie had is the visual effects and I certainly have seen much better than that, I mean did the saber tooth really look normal to you?

I went back to my hotel, took a crap, and felt much better. Don't ask me what the connection is.. maybe it's that this movie filled me with such crap I couldn't wait to get it out of my system.I knew I was in trouble as soon as the movie started.. with a boring narrator, a horrible script, and terrible acting. And all that is before the title was even displayed. It was all I could do to stay awake. The big moment in the first 20 minutes of the film was a chase scene between the Rastafarian cave men and a herd of giant mammoths. Here is where I knew the film was a failure.. NOBODY WAS KILLED. I mean, here's a chance to show how these people would have really lived. If you are chasing (and being chased by) giant mammoths, you'd think somebody might get squashed right? In short, this movie sucked. On movie phone, the Los Angeles Times gave this movie a 70. A 70??? Sounds like a payoff to me.","10,000 BC"
243,RabidED990,An Action Movie...With Cavemen!,4,21 March 2008,"I just want to state that I didn't just not like this movie because of it's historical inaccuracies. That's the least of my complaints. I mean, there's this thing called 'artistic license,' and one should realize that regardless of how stupid the movie is. Anyway....The movie's two main characters are D'leh and Evolet. Between the two of them, then fulfill every single prophecy ever. They are also mysteriously Caucausian in a tribe made up of essentially every race *but* Caucausians. So that's pretty weird.Anyway, Evolet and a bunch of D'leh's friends are kidnapped by this group of evil nomads for...some reason. And then D'leh has to take a group of his friends to go get them back. The traverse an entire continent in about a week's time (or so it seems), transferring from tundra to jungle to desert to grassland to desert again in about 30 minutes. On the way, it's mentioned that they loose the nomads tracks after about day three, but somehow manage to keep on their tails for about 8000 miles or so after that. Which is either really convenient or really really stupid. On the way, they steal a bunch of scenes from other, much better movies. The scenes of them traversing through the snow over mountains look like scenes in Lord of the Rings, almost shot for shot. Their encounter with the killer giant birds echoes Jurassic Park and the Raptor scenes (as do the scenes with the Baby Godzillas in anther Emmerich crapfest, Godzilla). The scenes where D'leh stabs a bird through the mouth and throws a spear at The Almighty looks exactly like less cool versions of scenes from 300. Even one of the movie's main antagonists looks *exactly* like Bitores Mendez, a villain from Resident Evil 4, right down to the bum eye.On the way, D'leh and company make sure to conform to every action movie stereotype ever. There's the token black sidekick character, big imposing Slavic looking villains, the love interest, really stupid dialog, scenes of slow motion for no reason, scenes of people uniting together to stop evil, etc. There is also absolutely no characterization to speak of throughout the entire movie. At all.And what action movie would be complete without stupid last words: ""Be as your father...be as your father...ughhhh"" *dead* ""You came for me...you came for me...bgaaaaah"" *dead* So yeah.The worst dialog, however, has to be the narration. Which pretty much sounds like: ""And so, the Old Mother summoned the life spirit of sacred Yaghren to bless D'leh and his band of heroes to secure freedom and give the gift of life to the people of the Vakhen Valley. His story will be whispered by our tribe forever."" Which is pretty much the stupidest sh*t ever.And the ending is basically moronic. D'leh overthrows The Almighty (who is in the movie for about six minutes, so he's pretty much the most evil villain ever.) and in the process destroys all archaeological evidence that Atlantis ever existed, and then invents agriculture. Before this happens, however, something really, really stupid happens. Evolet is shot with an arrow, and then is revived by the spirit of the Old Mother, the village spiritual leader of D'leh's village. Which is pretty much the most clichéd, contrived, Deus Ex Machina, cop-out bullshit ever.There are a few positives, however. The costume design is very good, as are some of the special effects. The scenery in general was well done, but flat and without personality. And the score, although forgettable, was also quite good. But honestly, the movie isn't awful, but there's really nothing particularly new or interesting about it to warrant seeing it.","10,000 BC"

245,ymghali,Children stuff,2,13 March 2008,"Just came out from the theatre where i saw the movie in Dubai UAE. I can only say that I had a big disappointment. First I have to admit that having seen the trailer raised my expectations and then the truth hit me: the plot is very simple, more like a children's tale. The dialogue is too shallow. The routine goes like this: every time there is a challenge it is solved through prophecy, or the solution can be predicted through prphecy, thus killing all suspense. It was not historically accurate: Pyramids were graves for the Pharaohs. Ancient Egyptians, and indirectly Arabs, are being portrayed as savages. Discoveries near the pyramids in Egypt revealed that construction workers were well taken care of both medically and nutritionally. Mammoths were extinct long before the pyramids were build. It can't be argued that ancient Egypt isn't the place because of the shape of the pyramids. The way those Egyptians are dressed is so out of context site and history. Had my expectations been less it would be a nice entertainment. The things is the title of the movie entails the way the viewers perceive it. A title with a specific time-reference such as 10000 BC, makes it impossible not to think of historical elements. I recommend that children aged 8-12 see it and forget it. D'leh is being portrayed as a tragic hero who is so honest that he doesn't want to claim glory unless rightly deserved, that's the only thing that makes us sympathize with him and to some extent, provides a moral lesson.","10,000 BC"
246,mtali42,"Not as good as I anticipated, but still a must see!",6,9 March 2008,"When I first saw the trailers my first thought was it was not going to work, and that it was just going to be one of those movies that depends on a great trailer to sale the movie, rather than having a great movie in itself. Then seeing more and more trailers, I let go of what my instincts were telling me and I got sucked in. And so after watching it, my first thoughts were right on. The story isn't very good, its the type of storyline that has been used in a lot of movies so a lot of it was predictable. But the only difference with this one are the creatures used such as mammoths, sabertooth tigers, and I think dodo birds. I'm pretty sure that it doesn't fit with the proper timeline that geologist have set these animals to have roamed the earth, but it all tied in well. I don't think that they were looking to give a history lesson. The last half hour of the movie is probably the only reason to watch this movie. The vast scale of the CGI is just ridiculous. I just can't believe how quickly we are progressing with CGI. We will soon get to the point, where actual people are unnecessary in all huge blockbusters.","10,000 BC"

Probably what i hate the most, though, is the fact that throughout the movie, the location and climate changes completely, and makes the directing look even worse. At one instant the actors are climbing a mountain, and then, some three minutes later, i swear, their in the jungle and complaining of heat. Its ridiculous. Overall, don't see this film. Its Roland Emmerich's worst picture, and he's already more than a tad untalented.

249,juarez-8,A film thats clearly aimed at around 10-12 year olds.,7,19 June 2008,"Lets get one thing clear. Yes I was disappointed by this film considering it was by the man behind Independence Day, Godzilla and the Day after Tomorrow and yes, I know I have been a little knid on my rating but I have my reasons for it.When the trailer for this came out, I was amazed at it as was my brother and I am pretty shore that anyone else who saw the trailer thought that this was going to be great. I think its fair to say that this film wasn't aimed at me. It was aimed for a younger audience around 12 year olds.The special effects have had a lot of mixed reviews. Some say great others say that they have been over exaggerated which I think is fair to say. The sabertooth tiger looks amazing along with the bird type things but the mamoths look a little too CGI if that makes sense.The historical accuracies in this film could turn it into a comedy for historians as the list just keeps on building up. I'm no history buff but I could spot loads- Horse riders, the saber tooth tigers were too big for the era when its set, the ships, the sudden change in landscapes, sleeping in the desert with little clothing, the list goes on.The acting is good from Steven Strait and Cliff Curtis but sadly Camilla Belle sadly disappoints which isn't really her fault as she has very little to say and do. One thing that seriously anoid me is that besides Cliff Curtis's character, every male character looked the same because there was nothing to distinguish the lead actor from his friends as their hair and clothes were virtually the same.Besides the historical inaccuracies this film makes for perfect family viewing. Apocalypto for kids! If you","10,000 BC"
250,Spookwhiskey,"Film Review - 10,000 BC",1,28 March 2008,"Perhaps 10,000 B.C.'s title refers to the 10,000 Better Choices available to undemanding viewers looking to scratch their ancient action itch. Apocalypto, 300, Peter Jackson's King Kong and Steven Spielberg's two Jurassic Park films each offer exponentially more entertaining excursions to perilous lost worlds and exotic locales than director Roland Emmerich's prehistoric fizzer.Concerning the exploits of an impossibly manicured young mammoth hunter (Steven Strait) on a cross-country quest to reclaim his Neanderthal-napped and improbably blue-eyed dolly belle cave-woman lover-girl (Camilla Belle) from the god-fearing clutches of a pyramid-building race of snarling human sacrifice enthusiasts, 10,000 B.C. couldn't come as more of a letdown. Emmerich, Germany's master disasterist extraordinaire, has heretofore proved himself an anarchic architect of cinematic soufflé, having built a career on vacuous and empty-headed exercises in big screen ka-boom, all dizzying pyrotechnics and the most special of effects. But therein has generally lied his appeal, with the likes of Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow - though daftness incarnate - offering a happy balance between epic spectacle and blockbuster thrills. Even his widely derided Godzilla redux delivers more grand-scale action and primeval excitement than you can shake an archaic spear at, and makes the plodding 10,000 B.C. look like Cenozoic Question Time.Emmerich's at his best with a stellar cast of whom to dispose and a mapful of U.S. landmarks to spectacularly obliterate. His incessant insistence on cramming his films with the gleeful destruction of American iconography (think Independence Day's exploding White House, The Day After Tomorrow's drowning and frozen Statue of Liberty) has previously tempered any qualms with broad, connect-the-dots plotting and thinly sketched stock-standard characters, and it's here where 10,000 B.C.'s sheer failure as an entertainment comes quickly and sharply into view. Without a Will Smith or a Dennis Quaid to wring precious credulity from Emmerich's painfully formulaic script, 10,000 B.C. has its considerable work as an action-adventurer cut out from the get-go, so the fact that - despite the immeasurable opportunity afforded by the prehistoric setting - this is by far the least visually remarkable entry in Emmerich's catalogue leaves this as a film with nary a grunt to recommend it.The action here is dull and far between, with Emmerich's ordinarily faultless eye for effects-laden extravagance seemingly preoccupied with the wholesale lifting of major plot elements from superior films. Apocalypto takes the worst hit, its slight plot replicated almost entirely as 10,000 B.C., too, sees its small hunter-gatherer tribe of noble (and impeccably-dentisted) savages whisked swiftly away by foreign meanies from beyond the dunes for a lamentable future of either slaving or sacrifice. But the pilfering doesn't stop here, as Emmerich inexplicably throws in a 300-esque 'god king,' a late and worthless entrant to proceedings whose appearance bears no dramatic weight save for our hero to have someone to aim a spear at come the inevitable rallying of the troops in the eye-rolling finale.None of which would matter in the slightest had Emmerich the courtesy to simply over-stuff the film with tiger-on-mammoth kickassery, but neither creature is granted so much as a sequence which elicits even the most meagre of excitement. The sabretooth, in particular, gets the stick's shortest end, in two action-free pussycat encounters which total ninety seconds of screen time and leave you wondering if the director is the same Roland Emmerich who blew off a guy's leg with a cannonball in The Patriot. Of the few inert and bloodless would-be-set-pieces on offer, only an attack by a pack of giant swamp turkeys comes close to raising something akin to a pulse, but even this fleeting highlight is wholly undone by a ridiculous hit-in-the-balls gag. Forget the stampeding mammoths and promises of a man versus sabretooth throw-down as per what can now be recognized as the film's deviously edited trailer; 10,000 B.C. is as stagnant as would be the modern-day remains of its absurd and unlikable heroes.With dialogue so bad you'll long for the Quest for Fire approach and not a standout action sequence in sight, Roland Emmerich's 10,000 B.C. is a lumbering, cavepaint-by-numbers bore, as primitive and outdated as the rudimentary tools of its Paleolithic protagonists.","10,000 BC"

Even if the makers of ""300"" did not research how ancient Persians looks like and how should they be clothed, the movie itself have good effects to watch and some historical accuracy, I have made a little research about this. But this movie, oh my God, inaccurate from the start until finish. It does not need a genius to know that in 10,000 BC there was no pyramids (oldest pyramids are dated as from the third millennium BC or 3,000 BC), and most certainly no textile (the oldest of which was dated as from 6,500 BC). I can live with the horses, because there are VAGUE evidences about the domestication of horses to be much longer back in time, but the others are just plain ridiculous.I am surprised this movie could make it to be #1 in box office and grossing 35,8 million USD in the first week.

It doesn't make any sense, it's acting sucks, the story looks like it was made up as the script was written, and it's a freaking abomination! I had to see this crap for my birthday because my parents said it would be great! What a load of crap.Here's how it doesn't make sense: The lands of the jungle, polar, and desert are mixed together without any transition other than the jungle being the middle. Also the tribes are a bunch of random races. It's like no one ever separated. And no tribes are nomads, which doesn't make any sense. The leader of what I assume is Egypt, since it has pyramids (Though pyramids were built much later than 10,000 BC) is white. WTH?!?! All right, the acting is pretty messed up. And, on something of a side note, there's some fallen priest whose speech is hilarious, and is the highlight of the movie. Seriously, that's the only thing that makes this film 3 stars.This film is an abomination to script writing because it looks like they took a bunch of pages from the phone book and stapled them together, much like they stapled ice, desert, and jungle together. Also the CGI isn't that great. And wouldn't mammoth's die in the heat of the desert? In the end, it's not a terrible movie. I mean, it's not like it's the worst movie ever made, but it's below average, and I'd suggest that you don't buy it on DVD.

257,shamgar-1,Agreeable,5,5 January 2009,"When I was shopping with my wife, we saw this movie on bluray for just 10 Euros. My wife thought she heard good things about the movie (I wonder which...), it looked interesting to me and  10,- for a bluray is a bargain even for 2nd-rate movies.Although I often frowned at inconsistencies concerning time-frame, historical events, altered voices etc, I did find the movie entertaining.CGI is good (especially for a 2nd-rate movie, although it's perhaps not meant to be that way), several beautiful scenery shoots, albeit that some also contain a decent amount of CGI. Clothing looks quite good: although it's not historically accurate, you can see that the filmmakers did pay a lot of attention to it.Story-outline is perhaps a bit cliché, but it's a cliché that pays off. It's an interesting 'Re-writing' of history: The filmmakers didn't claim to be 'historical accurate', instead it seems that they ignored that on purpose. The movie introduces that many obvious inconsistencies (compared to actual history), that it more seems like an 'alternate'/'parallel' universe.Although the acting is not great, it was decent enough (compared to the acting in most dutch movies or other 2nd-rate movies). D'leh is a like-able character: He starts out as an outcast with a 'forbidden' love-interest and gradually becomes the savior of many. D'leh is not a proud character (like many other hero's) but rather shy and although he just wants to save his love, against his will or desire, he becomes promoted as leader of the slave-revolt and in the end has to choose to save his girl, but leave the rest to rot in slavery or to risk her life and overthrow the slavers. During the movie there are many moments where you can see him think ""Crap, I didn't sign up for this, I just want to be with Evolet and raise a family"".I would rate this move 6 or even 7 stars, if it was not for the weird time-frame (characters travel on foot from Chinese/Mongolian mountains/tundra, via Asian Rainforests to Egyptian Desert in a matter of weeks), lots of historical inaccuracies.","10,000 BC"
258,Chloe1251,Oh dear..,3,28 February 2009,"I really wanted to like this movie. I heard it was cheesy and dumb, but it sounded like just the type of movie that I wanted one freezing Saturday night. With popcorn at hand, the opening had me anticipating a fun, exciting romp filled with prehistoric beasts and lots of action.The stunning vistas and mammoth herd was very impressive, but then all went downhill. Okay, so I caught on pretty quickly this was not to be historically accurate, but a sort of nonsensical fantasy. The hero and his chick appear to be Caucasian, yet other members of his tribe are Asian, Amerind or Eskimo, but they all speak modern English with what sounds like a Middle Eastern accent....I'm not sure which, but I decided that could be ignored as I just wanted to be mindlessly entertained. I was not.A movie with a hackneyed plot and lousy acting needs lots of exciting action and thrills, but this film is utterly boring and the few prehistoric beasts seen, with the exception of the mammoths (desert mammoths!), were embarrassingly poor, particularly the Sabretooth cat.I wandered off with 40 minutes left to go, so maybe it improved near the end. I don't care to find out.Really, you're better off watching the TV series ""Prehistoric Park"" or ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"". They're much more interesting and exciting, and the action and CGI are vastly superior.","10,000 BC"
259,panjshir_lion,Worthy of a watching.,7,5 August 2008,"The movie 10,000 BC was much like a new take on 1 Million BC and like the original, it certainly had it's moments good and bad (remember Raquel Welsh in ""cave"" bikini?). This movie has been undeservedly over criticized for it's historical short comings, the mixing of vast parts on the planet, and even down to the modern makeup on the cave-women and so forth but to tell you the truth, it all just simply works. The usage of various and diverse landscapes helps the user follow the film, the acting was generally on par for the genre', and in only a few places it was painfully ""Western"".However, the movie pulls on the common strings, men of various backgrounds standing together for a noble cause, a trumped up love story, and some totally unbelievable moments - like where the main character throws a spear an in unbelievable manor.For some reason, some movies just can not be liked for various and sometimes subtle reasons - and this movie should not be one of them. I WANTED to hate this movie, roll my eyes at the historical inaccuracies, the ""sub-par acting"", and cheesy ""been there and done that"" plot which anyone could try to say about this film. However, to the contrary ,the movie did exploit some common old themes but with the special effects it was entirely entertaining. I read a good book called ""Guns, Germs and Steal"", which illustrated the fates of human societies, I saw this film pulling on various parts of humanity and telling a convincing allegorical story of the human condition. This movie deserves some credit and was entirely what I expected for ""Western"" audiences (i.e. average movie goer). I suggest you heat up the popcorn and hit the play button.","10,000 BC"
260,mmcglass-90045,Good movie...not exactly accurate of course,7,16 August 2019,"I enjoyed the movie for the story. Yeah, there were flubs, such as the Wooly Mammoths were no longer around...they had evolved into elephants by 10,000 B.C. The Mammoths were being used to haul heavy stones for the Ziggurat. However, the oldest known Ziggurat dates back to around 2,200 B.C.The tribe in the move looked like primarily hunters and food gatherers. There were still hunter/food gatherer people around by 10,000 B.C., but the era of staying in one place and farming...creating villages, was beginning.Of course, there still some nomadic hunters around during the 3rd Millennium B.C., so they could have updated the time period, changed the mammoths to elephants, and it would have been in the time of the Ziggurats of ancient Mesopotamia. The Sabre Tooth Tiger (who befriends the prime character) pretty much became extinct about 12,000 years ago...so, some probably were still around in 10,000 B.C.","10,000 BC"
261,mari_del_mar,"Nice mammoths, no plot, inaccurate in so many ways",3,9 March 2008,"I am a sucker for special effects. Especially for prehistoric animals and such. Not even the CG animals can save this movie. The sabretooth is WAY larger than it should be, the carnivorous birds seem to have gotten a hovercraft in order to appear in Africa, all the way from the Patagonia...The mammoths are nice, and the girl is simply gorgeous, that's about as much as the film can offer. They should have stuck to the big CG animals a lot more, since they could not do acting, plot, or any other ""filmy"" stuff.All in all, not a total loss of time, but you might want to go listen to a hopscotch match on the radio... it might provide more entertainment.","10,000 BC"

It reminded me of the Saturday morning shows from the 50's, Like Ramar of the Jungle and Tarzan ... only with way better special effects. The acting and story line are just as terrible, though. If you enjoy this genre, it might be worth watching just for the stampeding mastodons at the end.","10,000 BC"
263,pocodfe,The desert saves the day,6,15 April 2008,"Point blank, if not for the story line being transferred from the bizarre cold homeland to the supposed Egyptian desert, this movie would have ranked even lower for me.This movie starts off, slow, and frankly, rather dumb. I understand we are being thrown way back in time, but why must everyone look so unkept, ugly, filthy, dirty? And, please...at one point, a group travel very far to a warm land, only to return to the below freezing homeland...why not just MOVE the homeland to the warm, fertile area. Hello? Who would chose to live in such harsh conditions? Anyway, after a very boring first hour, the move FINALLY kicks into gear as we are transformed to Egypt, and my word, the sets, the scenes, the gargantuan grandiose of it all...completely compelling at this point, and an interesting take on what might have happened and how a wonder of the world could have been created.Perhaps, the most anti-climactic scene in I don't know how long occurs, when the head ""god"" or deity is always enshrouded, so you never see what he or she looks like. Then, out of mortal nowhere, he gets harpooned, and we never get to see what he looks like!?!?!? What in the world? Totally disappointing.If not for the desert scenes, this movie would be a bomb. I can't highly recommend it, because let's be honest here...who was not bored with the first hour? At least final hour makes it worth while.","10,000 BC"

I watched it for what it is, a movie.I had no expectations, I just wanted to be entertained by a movie. 10,000 BC succeeded at that. The acting and dialogue are pretty mediocre at times but luckily there are quite a few fun action scenes in the movie which makes the plot, although a bit rushed, interesting enough to me.It's not worth a rewatch any time soon and it won't be remembered in a few years time but in the end this movie is a fun time and offers an easy viewing experience.","10,000 BC"
265,patriotjme22,Overall excellent movie,7,7 March 2008,"I thought this movie would be good and it was, the special effects were incredible, like LOTR was when it came out. The movie had a good storyline and was just the right length, if it was just a little longer that would have been good as long as it included more action. The only improvement they could have made was to include more action, specifically the kind with dinosaurs. That would of been great. You really didn't get to see anything other than the mammoths, tiger (singular), and that one type of dinosaur. But there was plenty of action and the scenes were really good, Adding even more creatures and action would of made me give this movie a ten. Overall, excellent movie, the only reason it gets a 7 is because I think it could of been even better with extra action sequences. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good action/adventure movie or enjoys movies based back in time. Excellent","10,000 BC"
266,garyhobson,Underwhelming,1,20 March 2008,"I went into this movie with somewhat moderate expectations. I wasn't expecting something absolutely incredible, but I was expecting something with some decent action and excitement.10,000 BC was a waste of my time and not worth the watch. Such a huge budget and such a huge waste. The problem with the movie early on was that it tried to tell this big epic story that I won't go into, because I simply didn't care about it. It just tries SO HARD to tell this story and it really really frustrated me, because the whole time I was just waiting for some action to happen. But when the action did finally roll around, I was left completely underwhelmed because all the pointless dialog and all those tribesmen wondering around put me off. I didn't care anymore, I just wanted the damn movie to end! There just wasn't enough action, and what action there was, was done poorly. To compensate for the lack of action, I was at least hoping for some sex or a nude scene from the girl. But no, it was a PG movie so we got none of that.There was a sabretooth cat that appeared in the movie. Cool! But it didn't do anything! Could have at least made it kill something, anything. I didn't pay to watch a sabretooth cat walking around and showing off it's special effects. What a waste.This is a movie that abuses it's special effects budget. Going through all that time and effort to give us cool CGI mammoths, pyramids and sceneries. But behind it all, a very crap movie.Thumbs up to Cliff Curtis who was the standout performer here. 10,000 BC didn't deserve him.","10,000 BC"
267,fabiank-1,Solid action movie,7,8 March 2008,"Being a (moderate) fan of Roland Emmerich i had high expectations on 10,000 AC and attended on the world premiere.All i have to say is that 10,000 AC is a very entertaining action film. I won't lie to you, this movie is not a about a great story, huge turnabouts or memorable characters. Instead, Emmerich delivers a visually stunning film, with powerful action scenes and a interesting blend of civilizations on a single territory.This is not meant to be a historic movie. It's not realistic or accurate on any means. It's an action film set on a very ""own"" interpretation of the time it portraits.If all you want to see is a great action experience with delightful visuals and an extremely beautiful girl (Camila Belle is simply perfect!) you cannot go wrong with 10,000 AC.","10,000 BC"

(sigh) should have watched my wall in the dark.too many plots, nothing explored. i was offended that the bad guy who lusted after the freakishly-blue-eyed girl (who always looked like she was on crack due to pupil dilation) was so ugly (lol) at first i thought awww he likes her, then as i saw and realised how much he liked her i became increasingly apprehensive that he would touch her (shudder).reading some of the previous reviews gave me a huge giggle as the veil of delusion had not been flung over just my eyes but others too after watching the trailer. i wont even get started on the saber-tooth (cant do it, its bringing up images of fail explanations and exploration).its one of those rare movies that you start making up alternative plots just because you think it would be too outrageous for them to follow the current one. 1- her giving him up 2- him letting his dumb-ass followers down but taking the girl and promptly saying ""screw you guys I'm going home"" 3- him riding on the kitty 4- his dad being the bad guy 5- the almighty being a woman 6- the albinos revolting against the extreme conditions and lack of sun screen, sunglasses(?) (btw i know they are blind) 7- the old lady screaming ""Desmond!"" or ""Ricky!"" or ""Peggy!"" (uk joke) 8- (i am actually making these up on the spot now)but you get the picture. it was what it was, but it promised so much more, even watching it knowing it could be bad can leave disappointment, (like a child at Xmas promised a PS3 but gets 1 of those plug into the front of the TV controllers) too cruel guys too cruel.","10,000 BC"

Other than the movie ""freak"" critics who say ""well the geographical areas and time spans are completely not believable and are stupid"" OK. First off, the definition of entertainment is meant to, i dunno, entertain you... aw ya see. Where getting somewhere. Do you think that a huge, planet like battle station called the Deth Star is real? Do you think Jedi knights are real? Do you think that Aliens are real? Do you think magical wizards are real? Hopefully all of you have answered ""no"" and if you haven't... talk with your moms. All those different examples tie in here. It is not believable, it is not real, and I'm Pretty sure they couldn't speak English back then. But let your mind travel. Let it go somewhere different. Do you know why, The Beatles, Rolling Stones, and Led Zeppelin, are so famous??? Because they open their minds to new things and let their minds travel. This movie was great. The ending was not stupid. Did you guys want it to say ""Luke, the force will be with you... always"" I... don't think so. The special effects were good.

Sure this movie misses it's mark, but it sure as heck hits another, even better one.If you haven't seen 10'000 B.C. yet and don't plan on doing so because of the bad reviews, I'm begging you to reconsider.

No it wasn't! Did i knew it before i've watched the movie? Yes i did!Did the scriptwriters tell me its a historical correct work? No they didn't.Should i now blame them with a rate of one because they mixed up different time epochs to create an interesting movie? No i shouldn't its a fantasy/action popcorn movie and like this i rate it.---------------------------------------------------------------------Like i said the story is always the same and i don't like it. but what i hate is this happy end thing every time. GOSH she is dead LET HER BE DEAD...please. Its over he did what he can but it wasn't enough OVER and OUT! And always this honey chatter, NOOOO it has to be 10.0000 times.... Its enough once (OK its an unfulfilled dream i know, best example HOW NOT AGAIN: star wars Anakin and Amidala...UAAAAH Horror)!Second storyline : the chosen one... He-Man and the Master of the Jurassicvers. A man so dump that he think a sabre-toothed tiger wouldn't kill him because he saved its life?

Little China?) to live to see how an old man is to dump to watch his back and the younger one throw a spear into the *cough cough* Marlboro cowboy?

When the first taste hits your tongue and all hopes of future meal enjoyment are flushed down the toilet. 10,000BC is the cafeteria lasagna. It looks goods, has the potential to be great, you have fond memories of other movies in the same genre that were good, and then you watch it. It's edible but just barely. The movie had pretty good special effects and wasn't boring which is why I gave it a five. The dialog and acting were for the most part sub-par.

It was filmed in Africa and New Zealand, and even the Eisentstein theory of shifting locations was confusing. My suspension if disbelief was marred. These mammoth chasers with dreadlocks must have traveled 10000 miles, and why would predators of mammoth chasers go that far to find slaves? The variety of African tribesman were pretty good, and how could you not like the Sabertooth Garfield?

The dialog among the characters is laughable; the narrator weaving throughout the film is annoying, and the story is just downright dumb.Even when the prehistoric animals show up it's a let down.

This movies isn't a waste nor is it lame as some might suggest.Most also say that it is not historically correct when it comes to the use of the mammoths. However, there have been recent discoveries of ancient mammoth bones on smaller islands. The mammoth couldn't have existed on just the island or we wouldn't have mammoth bones on other continents. This leaves the theory open that ancient civilizations had the capacity and ability to domesticate needed animals to assist them with their travels, labors, and rituals. So, their ideas are not well researched nor should have any credit. Last I noticed you were supposed to be going to the movies to have fun and let your imagination flow. I don't go with textbooks and other items to discredit films but rather to embrace how a director and creator choose to express their vision.","10,000 BC"

And give me a break with the clichés. 1. movie starts and we begin with a ""whos got the biggest penis contest"" 2. The cute girl gets abducted by evil men - and rest of movie are spend on a moron trying to get her back. 3. We are treated with a completely unbelievable scenery - from snowy mountain through a dense jungle to a desert in seconds. Give me a break. 4. When the end is near we see the people that are in control of the land - and they all look like buddha monks - anyone else noticed that?Storyline idiotic and the acting barely acceptable for a b-movie.

His smile shot my Blood Pressure all the time and he thought he'd look graceful. Owe Boll could a better movie with this budget. Avoid it all costs.

289,ken-bld,Another Nail in the Coffin of American Film-making,2,23 March 2008,"Take any one of the many thousands of Hollywood love stories you've seen and throw in a few prehistoric animated scenes as an afterthought and you get this movie. The movie begins with a fight over a girl and search for the girl throughout. Ho Hum. Obviously a chick flick. A woman all the men adore (she was not that adorable to me) and will die for(Helen of Troy theme). And the villain - you guessed it - an old white man. I had already read reviews that the story was terrible and was DisneyLike. But I thought I would see some impressive special effects.As you know Hollywood is great at delivering impressive previews but unimpressive at delivering the final product. The best part about this movie was the landscape shots. I would have been happier to just see two hours of that.And don't expect to learn any history. This movie is a mix. I kept expecting Hercules or Tarzan to pop up. For instance, I don't think there were too many ""model types"" with breast implants and mascara running when they cried back then. In 10,000 B.C. do you really think these folks were thinking about love or even knew what it was? Survival was all they thought about. With a title like 10,000 B.C. they should have focused on that.","10,000 BC"
290,kcfoster90,it really made me think...,5,19 March 2008,"the ultimate irony of this film is that in its over-simplified and sometimes jeuvenille dialogue, i felt it was very profound...the movie itself was not what i thought it was going to be. i felt that none of the sequences were deserving of the label ""epic"" and the acting was mediocre AT BEST.As you can tell, i TRIED to like the movie. I felt that the dialogue, as i previously stated, was oversimplified. I felt at times this was done for artistic reasons. I don't expect poetry from a man living during the dawn of human civilization...but at the same time, i felt that a 10 year old could have written a better screenplay...In all aspects, the execution of the movie was poor. Acting was poor. CGI was great sometimes, terrible in others. Writing was predictable and incredibly dry. Not to mention the fact that the film has MANY historic inaccuracies.The story is what really made me think.If you read the synopsis you know that the story is of a hunter trying to save his people. Not only does he seek to save his people, but he is out to save the woman he loves. What we have is not only the story of the classic hero, but a CLASSIC love story. Many moments i found quite touching...others i felt were forced, contrived, and just plain awful (the actors mainly to blame) There are few quotable lines in the movie, but a few standout moments give us a glimmer of what this film COULD have been...All in all, the film made me think. Its a film about humanity. Who are we? What defines human civilization? What about humanity is inherently good/evil? I LOVED the film if we are referring to it as an exploration of what humanity was/is/and always will b. But as a FILM it was downright terrible.A beautiful concept, a touching love story, an epic setting...all executed SO poorly that it hurt me as movie-lover to watch...","10,000 BC"

The acting is lame. The plot is not-existing. The historical accuracy - non-existing as well. Dialogues - oh my god... characters - you don't give a .... about them, cause they are completely artificial. Zero drama, zero tension, zero emotions, zero point in making this damn piece of garbage. Listen to me and do not waste your time for this excuse for a movie. It is so bad that i started to think it must be some kind of social experiment, like: lets test the limits of contemporary audience's stupidity by showing it the worst crap we can do.

Go to something else--you'll thank me!10,000 BC is the worst film to come out of the Hollywood machine in years. The second the characters began speaking English I knew we were in trouble. Since the English language wasn't really invented until 5th century AD, I decided to suspend my disbelief and try to enjoy the movie anyway. But it spiraled out of control from there to the very depths of stupidity. The whole film is an unimaginative mess only salvaged by some good CGI. It is a nauseatingly simple and contrived plot, in which unlikable characters do the same stuff we've seen a million times in far better films. I really can't disguise my disappointment that such a cool concept was completely destroyed. What a let-down. What a joke.","10,000 BC"

Although the Mammoth's played an important role in this film, the ravenous jungle Raptor birds were not. A man who talks to Sabortooth Tigers is not a man, he is a leader. The one who carries the white spear is destined to lift the peoples of the tribe to freedom and salvation. I do wish that the film had not been in English. I believe that subtitles might have made the acting in the film a little more realistic. This film reminded me of Apocalypto, The Swiss Family Robinson's, King Kong, Attack of the Clones the Animated Series, Clan of the Cave Bear and Bambi.","10,000 BC"

Unfortunately It is not permitted to write the word '5hite' 500 times! The story itself, before being made into a film, is garbage. I'm sure a nine year old could come up with better. I cannot understand where the funding for such a ridiculous idea might have come from. Was everyone drunk or stoned or something? Some of the scenery and costumes are impressive. Sadly that's all the positives I can find to put forward. The actors are second rate, third rate and even worse than that. Can't find many more words. Just be sure to avoid it. Trust me!

Not this one, oh no no, this ""adventure"" is UTTER SH**!! To tell you the truth,I walked out. Yes, thats right, I walked out. It really got so painful I could not stand one more minute of this absolute drivel.

296,toudi,probably the best epic we've seen in last few years,7,30 April 2008,"You ask yourself why the low score on IMDb I think there are two reasons: people lack the imagination and curiosity to check if the movie has merit and I encourage you to check it because it does more than you would think! For example I bet when you watch the movie you think/thought what the hell are the mammoths doing around these people and it turns out they have every right to be there! the last mammoths has survived as far as 2000 BC! I do agree there is some resemblance to Apocalypto but I believe it comes from the literature the genre is based on, these ideas has been exploited to some extent not only in Apocalypto but in many movies and books before but when you compare these two epics 10 000 BC, while maybe not as realistic, has one advantage it's a quality family entertainment while Apocalypto with it's grisly scenes is more suitable for older audiences and I suspect this is the main reason why Apocalypto has such a good rating it seems the violence these days is the only thing that can catch people's imagination! I dare you to check the list of 50 ""best"" movies of the decade you'll find there such a worthless titles as There Will Be Blood and Oldboy while you won't find Pirates of the Caribbean or Golden Compass! If you are regular here you know that IMDb ratings are usually but not always right this one is definitely not one of them! 10 000 BC has one of the most absorbing and entertaining plots I've seen in last few years.

297,brewster139,Underrated and totally worth watching,8,16 June 2015,This film to my mind has a remarkably poor overall rating - suspend your logic whilst watching and just enjoy the quality effects and the excellent locations. This is not Citizen Kane but when compared to other caveman flicks this has to be the best out there. The narrative is pretty simplistic and the acting is basic at best but the overall prehistoric environment that the producers have created is certainly engaging which provides both good action sequences and science fiction/fantasy moments. I would recommend any one interested in the fantasy genre to give this a glance but not to expect too much in relation to character development or intelligent plot lines. The other aspect of this film which I enjoyed was it's nod to antediluvian theories and how ancient civilizations possessed technologies we can no longer harness. Overall this is a film I would watch again and would recommend fantasy fans to give it a go especially if you don't mind occasionally having to endure a scene that is both bemusing and over the top. But by definition that is fantasy isn't it?,"10,000 BC"
298,deutschlars,The worst Emmerich film I have seen,3,27 February 2008,"In short. 10.000 BC is not a good movie. Judging from what I have seen and heard at the world premiere in Berlin, even Roland Emmerich and other people involved in the production have accepted that.Basically it does not work on any level. Even the most prominent talent of Roland Emmerich is missing: creating memorable and visually stunning scenes. Where you could criticize other movies by Emmerich as being shallow, they undoubtedly had ""popcorn quality"".This movie is one step below the rest of his output in acting, story, script and everything else. Nothing seems to work.In a couple of days main character D'Leh (German word for hero backwards) walks (!!!) through a number of climate zones, meets a ridiculous amount of ridiculously ""overdressed"" natives of all colors, sizes and shapes trying to bring down people who top all the silliness with their costumes and mannerisms. As a collection of short film exercises on set design, make up and wardrobe quite amusing, as a movie.a disaster.There is not a single original idea in this picture. The camera angles, the storyline, the little stunt at the end and the dialogs are all to obvious. I am sure you have seen it all before and you probably still remember where.The only original feature was a piece of sound design which unfortunately was only used in the trailer. Whatever quality you are looking for in a movie  see something else.","10,000 BC"

This is just a duplicate of many Hollywood movies with the same theme. Especially the hero's speech before the final fight just reminds me of the Brave Heart: the only difference is that the actor lacks charisma of Mel Gibson.I am shocked by American's enchantment about this kind of prophecy and superstition. Everything is so jejune, which can not be masked by its special technological effects.This film impresses me as very stupid and makes me doubtful of Hollywood's common sense in science.","10,000 BC"

And yes, some of the cgi is a bit sub par, but still-- this movie is very fun and entertaining to watch. It is a great weekend popcorn flick just to sit back and relax to. Just enjoy and don't expect a detailed documentary or something. There is plenty of action, suspense, and adventure to please all of the audience. Acting is pretty strong (though a little goofy at moments) but it pulls through. Some amazing settings and sequences should please as well.

301,berndjp,It's Roland Emmerich. It's Hollywood. What would you expect?,5,4 June 2018,"5 years after LOTR and 2 after 300 comes this 'prehistoric epic' which is none. Simply put, watching it from a historical perspective this is all nonsense, like Cowboys and Aliens. If accuracy is your filter, this will not exceed a 1 / 10. If, on the other hand, you approach this through a fantasy filter, watching a movie with inspiration from human history might lean more towards a 5 / 10. It is basically a fantasy equivalent to Stargate. But for blatantly copying from both LOTR, 300 as well as Stargate (and many others) a 4 / 10 seems more than fair.
Bottom line: if you can enjoy a Hollywood movie done by the numbers, without great CGI, portraying mediocre acting, an uninspiring plot, drawing inspiration from a variety of movies which set standards, this might as well be a one off entertainment.","10,000 BC"

But I went because it *was* out of the ordinary, and because it's so darned good to see a movie with some different people in it! The same 6 - 10 people seem to be in every Hollywood effort, and often they were chosen for looks and not for acting ability, so after a while I have to ask: Why bother to go to their latest offering? Just hit re-wind, then re-watch the last several movies they've made. Rinse, and repeat. Some of these actors are newish, it seems, and could have used a bit of coaching to get them to sharpen the turning points in the story, but the film was wonderful, enjoyable, fresh, yet mythic. New faces - not all the same shade - were refreshing and added interest. The story seemed fresh, yet as ancient and legendary as cave paintings - with elements from The Heroes Journey, a varied story that has echoed throughout history, even in modern tales like Star Wars. The emotions and struggles are simple and primal, with themes that we all can relate to - the need to protect and provide for those we love, our homes, our families. Give yourself a treat and see it: load up on popcorn, and go have a wonderful time.","10,000 BC"

I personally loved one of the parts during the middle of the movie, involving a Saber-Toothed tiger - you'll see it if you watch it.However, there are a few flaws. Horses were not domesticated around that time; in fact, they would have had to spread around towards Europe and Asia to be domesticated later on. The sudden change of climate from snowy to desert to humid to desert did not fit the time period either, given how fast they all traveled. The pyramids didn't appear that excellent back then either, and I could list a few more errors, but that would change your mind.overall it's entertaining, especially if you don't know anything about history.

As Stargate the movie or Conan the barbarian, this movie was very entertaining but not at Oscar performance, the actors was believable and i felt a connection with them as real people with real feelings, the CGI was cool - to enjoy the movie you must be Abel to forget about your classic history teachings.

306,Alestrel,Correct location,2,4 October 2008,"To correct the wildly inaccurate guesses of previous commenters: the story is set in prehistoric South America, not Europe or the Himalayas. The giant birds are phorusrhacidae (look them up on google: the Wikipedia article is quite good...) or some similar species, and the seeds the tribe took home with them at the end are clearly maize. I'm also fairly sure 'the almighty' was supposed to be Atlantean rather than an alien (although no doubt it could be argued that the mythical Atlantis may have been built by mythical aliens...)Other than that, I'm pretty much in agreement with the bulk of the comments. It's an oddly dull film, the acting barely adequate (not that the actors had an awful lot to work with), and while I accept that a fantasy can be as historically inaccurate as the writer/producer/director cares to make it, the mix of accuracy (the aforementioned phorusrhacidae and the multi-coloured corn kernels) and errors (mammoths hauling stone slabs under a subtropical sun?) was irritating.

Just having to separate, pulling apart when they start to grow together.Now I don't expect the actors to be that authentic with their own hair, but to clump hair together to look like ropes is so fake, and cheap, that it is laughable.They should have made a proper movie with an excellent script, but instead chose to produce this garbage.To anyone with intelligence, and integrity, this is not a film for you to enjoy.

This is probably the highest score I ever gave to one of his films. (Except for Stargate.) There are a bunch of idiots complaining how this is historically inaccurate. Well you monkey of course it is! Even says so in the beginning of the film! They are rewriting history, well ""pre-history"" and telling a story in the progress. You don't go exclaiming that when you watch a movie set in the Dark Ages or Victorian Era do you? No! You don't go, ""HAHA! Dragons you say? There were no dragons in during medieval times!"" Or, ""HAHA! A time machine? How incredibly stupid!"" Does the Stone Age have some unique privilege I do not know about? This is a fun movie! I laughed a lot in the beginning of the movie because of their ridiculous accents and voices. ""Me. Like you. You. Like the stars."" The writing in this movie is really, really cheesy but wait! It's actually even cheesier! Civilization seems to get more advanced as the film goes on. But the story and plot is the same. A simple man after a simple woman, also seeking revenge. How adorable!?

If you force them to act in front of a blue screen, something that sparks of real life is just, lost. Give them a real life environment, they give you life like acting. Give them a 2D blue screen, they will give you 2D acting.It is one thing to pretend that you are in real life in front of a camcorder, when you are surrounded by real people and objects, it is quite something else when you force the actors to stand of a blue screen and require them to react to non-existent people and objects. The director has the imagination and the brain to picture all these non existent people and objects, that's his job. I doubt most actors have the imagination or the brains to take on the director's job.Well, with this out of the way, what can I say about this movie. Has great CGI effects, without a doubt. The storyline is cheesy. I don't feel connected with any of of the characters, not even with that pretty blue eyed girl (she could have been hotter if she wore less, I thought most prehistoric women went around butt naked). In all honesty, towards the end of the movie, I couldn't care less if all them got trampled by those stampeding mammoths.As to that ""god"" figure, we were never told who he was, what he represented, why he wanted to build those pyramids, and why he had the big boat there, we never even got to see his face.

I also knew that all the amateur archaeologists (read: anyone who watches too much Discovery Channel)would pan it as 'horribly inaccurate'. The only part I found truly inaccurate was the part where Tictic was left wounded in the tall grass and Dleh came and rescued him after several minutes. I imagine a wounded creature would have not last anywhere near that long bleeding in the vicinity of ravenous predators. I liked it because it was a good story. I also overlooked a lot of supposed flaws. But then again, I am of the mind set that our still primitive sciences do not know all there is to know about now, much less about anything that happened in the distant past. I'd bet that if someone found the remains of a backhoe after it had been been buried for 5,000 or 10,000 years or so, would find only a few bits and pieces, which of course they'd likely identify as religious artifacts.

I was led to believe I would see man conquer the reigning beasts of a world dominated by nature.All I got was a poorly executed mammoth hunt, a tabby cat for a saber tooth tiger, and a gaggle of overgrown Dodo + Ostrich hybrids.That isn't even the worst of it. The dialogue was appalling, the story cliché, and the characters completely unbelievable, hollow, and ridiculous. The knowledge of that time would also not include cauterizing a wound, tending a fever with a cold compress, or anything of the sort. The only knowledge used in the movie which might have been present at the time was using the stars as guidance.I give one point for half-decent CGI, and one point for costumes. The rest of the movie has nothing to offer, whether it's story, acting, humor, action, suspense...You will find none of that here. I am hoping that nobody in Hollywood dares to let the screenplay writer or anyone who approved the screenplay near anything with a budget like this ever again.Please, if you have children and think that a cliché, CGI-driven film will be a good family activity, I beg you not to bring your children's IQs lower by allowing them to watch this ridiculously corny mishmashed slop.

The only thing I really have to complain about is that the movie was not the fun, action packed blockbuster I thought it would be. The movie had some action, but it was very minimal. The movie would have been much better if movie focused mainly on action. I guess Roland Emmerich tried to focus more on drama, rather then fun in this film, so that he might win an Oscar for something other for visual effects. Well Roland, go back to your fun summer blockbusters, trust me its the right move.Overall 6/10, B-","10,000 BC"
314,LeonardMonichi,...i expected more...,5,19 March 2008,"I have to admit that I had high expectations in this movie. Featuring Roland Emmerich as director the movie can'T be that bad, right? It can...The plot starts in a stone-age village where some kind of prophecy seems to be fulfilled soon: A young man together with his wife will lead humanity in a new age. Sounds familiar, isn'T it? Anyway, the whole story couldn'T catch me. OK, there were some great visual effects and animation in it; the hunt with the mammoth was great! The movements, the render, almost real. This brings me to another point. Why were the scenes with the mammoths so good and the scenes with the saber-toothed tiger soooooooooooo poor (I refer to the scene when the tiger attacks the village, by the way: why do they have always to exaggerate so much? The saber-toothed tiger wasn't half that big.) The implementation was cheap cheap cheap, it looked like an average student work... And the weighting, when the tiger jumps away, almost like a little cat maybe the animation department was on holidays that week I expected a movie that goes in the direction of ""Quest for fire"" (great movie), but it didn't. I took another direction. The direction of an endless number of previous fast-food-Hollywood movies with no surprises, no tension, no depth, no story..... Actually this movie took a lot of elements from other recent movies like 300 (damn good movie!). The scene when our cave-man hero is in front of of the Pharao is a bad copy of the scene where Leonidas faces Xerxes. Both use a lance to attack their enemy. Not just the scene set up was the same, the narrative aspect too: a single human faces a god, and through the injuries provoked by the lance he proves that neither the Pharao nor Xerxes is a god. Obviously our cave-man hero killed his enemy, while the good old Leonidas just wounded Xerxes. But that's enough to tell the story, he bleeds ergo Xerxes isn't a god! Another point that argues me: Credibility! The historic recreation is totally wrong. Look it and you will see what I mean. Pyramids 10.000 B.C.? no way (although there are some rumors, saying that the pyramids have been built before the last ice-age; search for Erich von Däniken to know more about that ;-). Howevert the thing that disturbed me the most was the ending. OK, in the whole movie there were some mystical elements, like the signs on the hand of the Evolet, the prophecy and and and. But there's a huge difference between mystical and magical! I know that Hollywood movies need to have a Happy End. But in this way? Is this really what the audience wants? Isn't that too silly? Wouldn't it be a Happy End anyways? The slaves where set free, the ""bad"" Egyptians defeated (10.000 B.C). I will not tell you the ending not to steal you the surprise... and what a surprise..OK, the movie wasn't so bad as it seems from what I write. But the people who make this movies are supposed to be the best, so they deserve to be criticized in every possible point! And there's a lot to criticize.all grammatical and syntax errors are intentional","10,000 BC"
315,virtualresidence,"Thousands years of evolution for the human beings, to found the word ""CRAP""",3,13 May 2008,"This is the kind of movie that makes you ask yourself the question of ""Where the hell did they find the money to produce such crap and, most importantly, how could they have achieved this without being, at any time, caught with remorse?""No you cannot let you taken by the plot and watch it with the eyes of the innocent, not it is not being too much picky to say 10.000BC is one of the worst movie of the year, and yet so pretentious. That's a shame and would love to see the actors of 10.000BC performing some other acts as they look sympathetic, almost naive. But man... the Great Pyramids in 10.000BC, a bamboo forest, then the African continent, starting in the inner lands (without having crossed any ocean though) and miraculously ending in Egypt. No to mention about 100 anachronisms (read other reviews about that).There's no respect for History or the great achievements of our civilization (the Pyramids being one of the Wonders), nor respect for the viewers.

316,poshspicez,Okay,6,23 June 2008,"This movie wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. The visual effects were by far the best part of the movie, and yes, the Morgan Freeman-like narrator got a little corny after a while, but all- in-all it was okay. I liked the characters, the plot was thin but got the job done, and I don't want my money back or anything. And it wasn't like super-gross or anything, either. There weren't really any bad scenes of violence or anything. I liked the imagination of it; all the different cultures. All of the wholly mammoth Saber tooth tiger stuff was a little much but I didn't mind it. All in all, it was a little corny, yes, but enjoyable enough. Won't win any Oscars (except maybe one of those cinematography ones), but it wouldn't be on my list favorites list.","10,000 BC"
317,william-fu,Too predictable...not worth the time,4,13 December 2009,"As soon as I popped in the DVD for this movie, I was anticipating another great fantasy story, but only up until the first 30 minutes of the film, somehow I couldn't take it anymore, I didn't want to watch it anymore and so I just moved onto the special features. I wondered why I would felt this way, and the biggest feeling I get from this film is the predictable storyline. It is like the bread and butter, the most simple and easiest story structure for a myth. It is like the sword in the Stone, the Pathfinder, Excalibur, that sort of thing. You have the hero denying his own destiny at first which become very obvious that he's going to get the white spear and then unite all the people and destroy the enemies. Sounded just like ID4 (independence day), but dressed up in another fashion, taking place at another time. The film does possess good visual effects and great world creation for all the props and stuff. However, the title 10,000 BC just kept on giving me the sense that this movie was supposed to be related to the scientific history of mankind. I have to keep on reminding myself that no, it isn't related to any real facts at all rather, more from the directors or writers theory about some lost civilization existing in the past. I agree with this notion, of this theory for the creators to think that maybe there is some kind of lost-advanced civilization in the past, but to me this just sounds overly exaggerated. We knew that the Mayans, and the Egyptians, or the Aztecs are the perfect example of being the worlds most advanced civilizations in the past. The inventions and their cultural advancements are stunning as we have studied them, but I just don't believe what this film is trying to show. As I looked at the advanced civilization portrayed in this film, I am not convinced that they ARE the advanced civilization. It looked more like a copied version or combined notions coming from the Mayans, the Aztecs and other civilizations.Storywise, I find it to be overly stereotypical about the way of the community life of the hero. Especially the portrayal of the witch shaman who's somehow possesses all this magical abilities to see herself from other people's sites. You could tell very obviously that she is what she is. Too Predictable, and that kind of things you always see in other films or animation. I couldn't bare it anymore, and I don't even want to watch it...","10,000 BC"
318,brittannlee,This movie was awful.,1,10 May 2010,"I thought that this film was really going to be something exciting, something truly amazing...oh how I was wrong. The first three minutes into this film I knew something was terribly off, way off and of course that is when you know a film is truly bad. As the minutes ticked away, the acting got worse and worse! How could have Roland Emmerich allow this movie to have such f*#king terrible actors, seriously? This movie could have been amazing, hell it could have been a blockbuster if it wasn't for the poor choice of actors and lack of life. The only thing good that can be said about this movie is that it really shows that Hollywood thinks that audiences are becoming dumber. Seriously, this movie made me feel like I was a two year old watching a movie, and that really says something right there.Don't watch this piece of garbage, it is really not worth your time. Sure as he11 was not worth my time.","10,000 BC"
319,film_afl,An OK movie....Judged in the right way...,5,10 September 2012,"As a fact-based movie true to around the year 10000BC it won't work, i believe the movie makers should have called this flick ""X thousand BC"" or something. Then they could have avoided this discussion....But anyway, as an action-movie it is rather entertaining although it is clear that the story is thin. In my opinion this movie is all about the visual effects and CGI. I don't think its worthy of a 1 or 2 star rating, i have seen worse, way worse movies...That the actors doesn't look like real cavemen is something that have to be taken for what it is. This isn 't exactly the first movie where you can come with that objection. Also in many other movies the actors doesn't look completely credible many times. Considering the large budget they had it is somewhat depressing that they couldn't come up with a better script and plot. The movie could have been better, there was potential for it. All in all, a rather entertaining movie that isn't worse than many others. But i believe it was all about the marketing with this one, when people had bought the movie-tickets and where at the cinema they perhaps started realizing that it wasn't what had been promised, but then they had already bought the ticket, indeed......","10,000 BC"
320,eheadz,Waste of time,1,28 February 2008,"I just saw this movie today on a preview. Makes me laugh a lot. The plot is lame, the special effects lame also, the ""actors"" are awful, most of the time they're involved in ridiculous situations and stupid dialogs. This film don't work neither as an adventure nor as an epic movie. Better rent the ""Apocalypto"" DVD or try to find the 60's gem ""1 million years B.C."", with Raquel Welch in a sexy animal skin bikini, dinosaurs stop-motion animated by Ray Harryhausen and more action. Bottom line: the director Roland Emmerich is turning into a expensive trash movie specialist, kind of a Spielberg of the genre. Just remember what he do with exciting titles like ""Stargate"", ""Independence day"", ""Godzilla"" and almost did with ""The day after tomorrow"", all gone to the toilet trunk...","10,000 BC"

I wish that I had consulted this forum beforehand. To be fair, it had the saving grace of a much shorter run time than most of his works. It was all downhill after that. You can see the entire body of the watchable portion of this film in the trailers. Save your money to buy the DVD in the discount bin in a few months. Better still, the plot (such as it is) makes better viewing in Stargate, Conan the Barbarian, Quest for Fire, etc....... This is 100 minutes of your life that you are never going to get back. Too bad that the same is true of the price of admission.","10,000 BC"
322,kmejodude,a horrible waste of time,1,11 March 2008,"Last time I actually wrote something on IMDb, it was a comment on Anderson's insult to the Alien/Predator franchise with his ridiculous AvP. But this time I'm compelled to point out a couple of things that just RUINED my evening at yesterday's grand opening of the movie in Croatia. I'm still dumbfounded as to how a decent director such as Roland Emmerich used to be can make something so utterly lame. Maybe I was expecting too much (something like the Clan of the Cave Bear meets Independence Day), I was all wound up about this flick for months, and in return I got The Life of Brian meets Apocalypto meets A Walk With the Beasts (by that, I don't mean any of the good sides of the aforementioned achievements). The best actor in the movie is a sabretooth tiger, and its CGI is tragically off-mark. I also bet the boys in WETA Digital are sweetly laughing their $$es off, comparing their 4 year-old CGI mumakils from LOTR to whatever-they-call-mammoths in this movie.. There are also issues with the climate and surroundings, rainforests right beneath the Alps and the deserts right beyond that..and right beyond that the Tower of Babel (under construction, with mammoths as the main contractors !!!!), flanked by the Khufu's Pyramid, and the rulers that are actually from the Atlantis.. It's all just a horrible mess, an incoherent patchwork of different archetypal images completely out of place and time, with zero plausability. For any of you out there with any sense of taste, please avoid this movie. It's an insult to the intellect. I didn't particularly like The Day After Tomorrow but after this faux-pas, with much regret I'm blacklisting Emmerich as a director. And the screenwriters too. Also the CGI people and the actors. That's how bad I think this movie is.","10,000 BC"
323,falconisthebest,"Historical, and geographical mess",3,4 June 2008,"I had a lot of people tell me that this movie was a disappointment, but i watched it with a clear mind, and God knows i gave it its chance, and as cliché and weird the storyline is, the most annoying thing about it is the complete and utter disregard to the accual history. i mean i understand that no one claimed it to be a historical documentary, but when you place the pyramids and sphinx 7000 years before their accual built date, and and really through every thing known about the Egyptian empire out the window, i think you are pushing the limit, i will not go into detail so as not to spoil anything, but even if the story did not mean the pyramid builders in the movie to be Egyptians, i think they blew that defence with the great deal of resemblance, down to the sphinx and the sun boat.the other thing that really made this a pain to watch, is the complete disregard to the laws of nature and geography, it makes you feel as if traveling half way across the earth only takes a couple of weeks on foot, and i am no scientist, but even i know that mastodons or mammoths an arctic animal could not have survived in desert heat.this is only my opinion but judging by the ratings, a lot of people share the disappointment. don't pay money to buy or see thing in a theater, a TV watch or rental will not kill you tough.","10,000 BC"
324,epiphanes,Bullcrap,1,22 September 2015,"Awful. Just plain awful. This movie is typical American bullshit. No script, lot of CGI. No background story and no effort to bring the story closer to the public. First of all I would forbid making movies that don't have some kind of authenticity. What I mean is what Mel Gibson has done with his two historical movies. They are not perfect, but surely are more realistic than the rest of the stuff. If you're making a movie about caveman, they don't speak f... English. They screamed and had some kind of their language. Same with other parts of history. Don't waste your time. Better watch much older but more realistic movie A Quest for Fire from 1981.I won't waste my words on this movie as I have done with my time watching it.Peace","10,000 BC"
325,bluey71,an awful movie,1,18 March 2008,"The plot is ridiculous. It almost tries to be a ""family version"" of Apocolypto but fails miserably. As the storyline progressed, it just got worse and worse and my yearning for the exit was getting hard to fight.The dialog was reminiscent of the Star Wars prequels. The kind of dialog where you tell yourself ""people don't have conversations like this"". The acting left me embarrassed for the actors. Although they are limited by the script, the actors can't convince you that anything in this movie could possibly be real. They also fail in making you care about any of them at all.The special effects did not come close to redeeming this movie. The fight scenes were laughable. The mammoths and saber tooth tigers shown so exclusively in the trailers barely exist at all in the movie.I also found it amusing the ""bad guys"" looked like Arabs and the 'prophecized savior' was a white woman with blue eyes. LOLI wanted to leave around 20 to 30 minutes into the movie. It's terrible. I stuck to the end just to see how bad this movie could possibly be...and it's bad, real bad.","10,000 BC"
326,wktvahey,Roland Emmerich hits a new low,4,8 March 2008,"Well, aside from the historical inaccuracies that everyone has pointed out, this movie had horrid acting, insipid dialog, and a cliché plot line that any moderately skilled elementary school kid could have written. So what are the redeeming qualities of this movie? The scenery, some of the CGI, and that's about it. On a technical level, I found it hilarious that for all the hype about this movie, it was far worse than I could have imagined. Someone made a comment about the lighting of this movie. There were definitely inconsistencies in the lighting, which added to the list of things wrong with this movie and made it feel like perhaps it was a rushed project.I think if this movie were made without any dialog except for the narrative, it would have been much more enjoyable as a whole.","10,000 BC"
327,melon_fire0902,Worth watching,8,23 July 2008,"For me, 10.000 B.C. was similar to Apocalypto in many regards: hell of a long time ago, main character trying to rescue loved ones, etc. But, I have to say I liked this movie much more. The movie sends a good message of togetherness and love. Camilla Belle (Evolet) takes off running with this role, as she does with all of her roles. The movie starts out at a good pace. The ""epic"" sort of feel is a plus for me as I am a fan of legend/fairy-tale sort of movies. The cinematography is great as is the CGI (one of the differences between 10.000 B.C. and Apocalypto). The sense of unity between all the tribes was almost overwhelming for me. Overall, the movie was good. I would recommend it to anyone who was disappointed by Apocalypto.","10,000 BC"

While doing so, he finds his true calling and inspires others to stand up for themselves and fight back.This movie reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Conan the Barbarian, Apocalypto and Braveheart set in ancient times with modern special effects. There is not a lot new to this story. It has been told many times before. The story line includes references to ancient mysticism in an attempt to explain certain acts and make the story more interesting to the viewer. There are also veiled references to ancient Egypt and Atlantis, though none of this is explained. I must say this is not a great movie. I got kind of bored at times. The only reason to see it on the big screen is for the special effects.","10,000 BC"
329,stephs_sanctuary,It was an okay movie. It did not meet my expectations,4,7 March 2008,"I decided to watch this movie based on the trailer because it looked so action packed. I also loved Apocalypto and this film has a similar atmosphere so I decided to watch it. Upon going to the theater I had no gripes about its historical inaccuracy because it is a movie after all. I came in to watch a movie movie that will entertain and mostly WOW me. And in some aspect, the movie entertained me.First of all the protagonists are extremely pleasing on the eyes. Secondly I love the CGI effects of the film. The acting was not superb but it sustained the whole film. I also like the unintended comical moments of the film. It was supposed to be a very serious film but my companion and I can't help but laugh at some parts of the film especially the parts of Old Mother. And the plot maybe simple, but I liked how the whole prophecy debacle meshed well in the whole of the film. At first I expected that people in the tribe of D'leh were the only ones who believed in the prophecy. As the story progressed though, it unfolds that all of the tribes in the film believed in one true prophecy, even that of the enemies. However this movie did not WOW me. It did not meet my expectations. I was mostly disappointed in this movie because of how slow it seemed. There were not that many action sequences, there were lots of walking (really how could they go from snow to jungle to desert in a span of days?!?) and there were lots of talking. In other words, there were lots of white spaces that were not really needed. An epic battle scene between the protagonist and the antagonist is not even present because the mammoths(?) did it for them. Yep, the mammoths crushed many of those soldiers instead of us seeing a real fight.Due to the lack of action sequences and conflict with the film, I did not empathize so much with D'leh too. His journey to become the one true savior was not that convincing as he did not seem to experience much of hardships, as compared to other heroes in historical epics like Apocalyto for instance. Granted that in Apcalyto, the protagonist was the one captured so he did endure a lot of pain in the hands of the enemy. D'leh's experiences, however, still came short. For instance D'leh's encounter with the giant birds, the mammoth and the warlord were so brief that it became anti-climactic. And even D'leh's experience in the whole journey are not convincing. Unlike other heroes, D'leh did not have that much of a groundbreaking epiphany that would transform him into the hero that could liberate everyone. If there was one though, it came near the end, when his mentor Tictic died. Tictic's death could serve as a focal point to develop D'leh's character some more but it wasn't fully utilized. And as I recalled D'leh was not even wounded throughout the whole film -- a feat. considering that one is fighting wild animals and many enemies.I also had a problem with the cliché storyline and how this movie combined some of the most common archetypes to create a story, ei: the wise mentor, the prophet, the damsel in distress, a love triangle, a prophecy, and an ordinary person rising to become everyone's savior.The ending was not that great for me either. It comes back again to how anti-climactic it seemed. Because in just a spur of a moment, D'leh killed the enemy's leader with one quick throw of a spear. Also his encounter with the warlord, his nemesis when it came to Evolet, was quickly killed. There where no iconic duel so that D'leh can be viewed as an authentic hero. And I had a problem of how Evolet magically came back to life in the end, courtesy of Old Mother sacrificing her own life. I know that this story had some elements of fantasy but the ending was way convenient. Deus ex machina, as some might say, wherein some magical event led to the salvation of Evolet. I wanted Evolet to either die or she might live because her wound was not that serious. The end sequence ruined the whole magical realism atmosphere for me. And lastly, I could not also reconcile the fact that the message this film is sending out is quiet ironic: that is D'leh being the savior and liberator of his tribe because in reality his victory is but a temporary one. This is not included in the film, but I know personally that what D'leh did, will not stop other tribes and/or civilizations from raiding other tribes in the future nor will his heroic deed assure the safety of his tribe, or others he had saved, in the long run. And in essence, D'leh did not even save his tribe,but only a few members of his tribe who were captured. So his role as an iconic hero falls short of expectation too. But maybe that's just me and my tendency to over think so much. There are still many quirks that I have in this film like how Nakudu could understand all of the different tribes' languages, or how most of the actors look very much alike that it can be somewhat confusing. I won't delve into them though because it did not seem to bother me as much as the gripes that I had above.If you want to be entertained, 10000 BC is a decent film but if you are expecting a phenomenal epic, this movie may fall short of your expectations. I hope this review helps. c"",)","10,000 BC"

Nevertheless, let's be clear on the reasons I went to this movie : bonding with my son and his two friends (age 14-15). They liked it a lot. My official review for the movie, in front of them, is : great! Now for the hard truth : it is awful. Actually, I should have known, it was an Emmerich movie.

They reach the bad guys city which seems to be in Egypt (Is that a sphinx?) where they are using slaves to build pyramids. That was a long way to go for a dozen slaves. How on earth is that cost effective? These bad guys are going to go bust.Biggest laugh out moment was seeing woolly mammoths being used to drag stone blocks in the middle of the desert. Incidentally I seem to remember that Egypt was lush and green in 10,000 BC. Hero rescues his people. Worst moment was the twist at the end which let the film have its cake and eat it.

334,filox35,"Really 10,000 BC???",1,24 June 2008,"This movie is another unintentional comedy. It must be kind of hard to find a writer, a producer and a director that share the same extraordinary level of ignorance, to display textile clothing, steel shields, pyramids, modern domestic horses (well bridled), domestic mammoths, complex languages, pants, industrial cranes for construction, adobe huts (Arizona style), modern archery, indoor lanterns, and more, on the year 10,000 BC., it almost felt like The Flintstones. Anyway, unless you want to laugh at stupidity I wouldn't recommend this flick.Aside from that, there's not much else to see in it. If you don't let all that incoherency annoy you, maybe you can get entertained by this movie, because even though the story is not so good, it's not that boring either, I was laughing all along, but I know it was not intended that way.","10,000 BC"

The characters are awesome, notice the guy from Live Free or Die Hard as the tribe leader...smokin' hot Camilla Belle, freaky old woman, and Steven Strait. The mammoths were really well done, the god-king, and I know everyone is screaming about historical accuracy but do you know what?? Who cares?! Movies are about entertainment, if I want something real i turn on the History Channel. So give this movie a break, and take it for what it is...a kick ass action flick with some great CGI.I gave it an 8/10, maybe I did like it more than the majority, but it deserves at least a 6.5.","10,000 BC"
337,childofkorn13,Guilty pleasure,7,28 July 2008,"I rented this movie and was expecting the worst to happen, based upon countless bad reviews, but to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not saying that it was perfect, as I did have certain issues with it that were already mentioned in earlier reviews. I knew it wasn't going to be historically accurate, because it seemed like a mix of many different cultures. I don't have an issue as to what their facial features looked like, because I don't believe in the whole evolution process anyway, so that wasn't a major issue. For those that do believe in it, it may be a problem, because they all look very modern. I did find it rather interesting that four men walking on foot could catch up so quickly to the men on horseback, but considering that the ""bad guys"" were dragging a big group of slaves along, and had to stop and rest...it did seem....possible? I liked the woolly mammoths and the saber tooth tiger (I was disappointed that there weren't more scenes with the tiger) and I didn't understand the giant bird things eating everyone in the tall grass, but they were still fun to watch. The story wasn't that terrible. It kept me interested and wanting to see what would happen next, especially since I do like the actors/actresses. I liked their dreadlocks, the costumes, the crazy face paint, the different tribes, and the CGI. So, this one is going to go on my 'Guilty Pleasures' list.","10,000 BC"
338,mohit115,"10,0000 BC - Contains Spoilers, so read at your own risk!",1,7 March 2008,"I probably saw the trailer for the movie in Dec'2007 and had my mind set on watching it first day first show since then. I imagined a movie based in 10,000 B.C. with lots of fights and high quality graphics . The movie that I saw today was disappointing-to say the least.It's not even within a 1000 km's of what I imagined.The director went through LOTR, The Matrix, 300, Apocalypto Now and several other movies and decided to make one single film out of it.The story starts with a civilization living in some snowy mountains.Oh well, actually the story starts with a narrator's voice which is so gloomy and bad that you'd soon start to feel that this is not the movie you imagined. OK, so back to the story. This civilization has a nanny , like the Oracle from Matrix movies, who can see the future . See sees four legged demons coming to destroy the village, and when they really come, I thought here we go with the excitement. I wondered if next we'd see some real demons or probably even the saber tooth tigers shown on the posters for the movie. The excitement was short lived as soon you get to know that the demons are nothing , but normal men on horses . For almost half the movie you don't know why did they attack the civilization and took about 15 of the helpless people, including the heroes love, as prisoners.The only thing worth seeing in this movie comes in this first half when the men chase several mammoths.But then , that's it.The middle of the movie shows you the chase by the hero to get his love back. The punch line for the movie says "" It takes a Hero to change the world "". God knows which world the hero was trying to save , as through out the movie the only thing the hero seemed interested in was getting back his love. The middle portion does give you an ostrich type bird attacking the hero's group scene and all, but the director fails to provide any excitement. The widely publicized scene of the Saber toothed tiger with the hero was a damp squib as they don't fight but make friends. Even the animation for the tiger was very unreal and coming from the people who made Independence Day, this was a huge letdown. Then come s the interval and one feels that probably the director has the best hidden for the end.The end shows you a scene straight out of LOTR finale. Only that it was no where as magnificent as the original. We do get to hear the bad guy finally who's almost 8 feet's tall and one gets the feeling that the end can be an interesting one. What happens in the end is as mediocre as the entire film. The Hero picks up his spear and launches it at the big baddie, the spear goes through the bad guy's body and the bad guy's dead. No fight, no special effects, just dead. It was at this point that I wanted to scream and shout and say why did the director choose those magnificent scenes for the trailers, why did he not portray what the movie actually was . Probably like me, he too never understood what the movie was actually for! While coming out of the theater, one of my friends said it'd be nice to see a scary movie type spoof of this movie, and I just wondered if this wasn't already a spoof movie on LOTR, Matrix, 300 and others. Better watch the trailers 20 times, you'd still feel happier!","10,000 BC"
339,JJskillz,Less than a mediocre movie,4,8 March 2008,"I'm sorry that this pre-history movie was just less than a mediocre movie.Seeing the preview of the movie, I was like ""Oh, here we go. Another exciting pre-history movie. I can't wait to see it."" Once I got into the cinema and the movie started, I was excited and all.When the movie started to roll out through to the middle scene, I was waiting for a moment where something special had to happen, but it never did. Then it rolled again to another scene and to other, it was getting a worse, then on and on and on again to the end. I walked out feeling wasted (ripped off) and didn't walk out happy.It would've been better if they hadn't spoke English in the movie because it was just unbearable to hear them speak English. If they spoke another language like in Apocalypto, it would've been at least praised for that.To all those pre-history movie fans, try to avoid this movie in the cinema because it was expensive for me. Wait for it to come out on video stores then rent it so u won't feel wasted seeing it in the cinema.","10,000 BC"
340,shutupDAAVE,Just okay,5,20 February 2008,"I saw this a few months ago at an advance screening and was really excited. disappointed. Enough said. It just really wasn't that great. The CGI, on a lighter note, was amazing of course, and sadly, the highlight of the movie. I just feel like it was trying too hard to be an ""epic"" and didn't concentrate enough on development. It might be the most simple plot outline I've seen recently, making it bland. It was kinda slow, the story was pretty lame, and the two ""lead actors""(Camilla Belle, and Steven Strait) looked like they were almost in black-face makeup, or just really dirty, but with makeup, not dirt. It was entertaining, however brutally boring it seemed you want to see what happens in the end. And Cliff Curtis was pretty good. But he always is. Last note; the two aforementioned ""leads"" aren't very good actors. sorry, but 4.5 of 10","10,000 BC"

Unfortunately this ended up being one of the worst movies I ever saw at the cinema (a la Dungeons & Dragons). What I hoped to be an action movie turned into some hopeless romantic bungo with absolutely no entertainment value at all. The special effects are OK, which are the immediate highlight of 2 hours of wasted film. The director makes a big mess of trying to keep the regular crowd interested, while at the same time trying to get a G rating so 5 year old kids can bring in some bucks as well.

I think this movie was *WAY* over hyped for the performance that I watched, however. The movie was predictable and downright boring in parts. The main actors had lackluster performance at parts and I didn't feel that there was much emotion in their voices. When the main guy finds out about his father's death for instance, not a tear was shed. Granted he was being attacked at the time and there was no time, but he could have let out a cry of pain as he lept into battle or something. Honestly, the only part when he showed emotion is at the end when the girl ""dies"" and that wasn't up to full standards I feel.It had some entertainment value, but overall I feel I wasted my money. Good thing I went to the drive in on half price ticket night.","10,000 BC"

Well its not that bad . Its fantasy movie of bad quality and there s no need to talk about how it s historically wrong or geographically inaccurate and so on and i think it s ridiculous to even try to do so . On the other hand the film doesn't respect viewer intelligence . Its poorly made from all aspects . Never the less you can watch it and enjoy it but you would have to be an open minded to a serious of unbelievable crab . Still en great effort was made on the movie even if it was in vane. It was better for them if they made changes on the film to be intended to children from the first place .I give two stars to the film for the fact that i have watched worse and another one to the beautiful leading actress. She doesn't act much but she has a nice presence .,"10,000 BC"
344,sp2974,well..now there's an explanation for how the sphinx got here..,1,9 March 2008,"10,000 BC depicts the story of life when hunting mammoth was the equivalent to PlayStation, snow covered the land (yet the cast still remained shirtless, and humans looked like walking pubes. The movie carries on with horrendous acting, overwhelming special effects, and of course the ever so dreaded ""historical errors."" This movie seems to be a film consisting of constant repetition. For example, Camilla Belle gets herself trapped in a net on average 6 times. Steven Strait manages to repeat the line ""I will not leave you."" about every 15 minutes and finally there is the old woman. Apparently directors were so desperate for clips to be used in the commercial, they added the scenes in which the old woman ""gasps for air and wakes up from her eternal sleep."" (Please Note: this got old the first time, yet directors realized it added suspense to the film. Also, after casting they realized she did not speak English and instead resorted to unplugging her oxygen tank to redeem their mysterious plot value.) I believe the makers of this film also wanted to incorporate realistic elements to emphasize the ""impact"" of this picture. The ten minutes of pure celluloid (for those of you that don't know, it is what film is made of) wasted on a dinosaur chase through grass as tall as a man Definitely added to history. Even the scene of TIc-Tac's healing process using pure granite and animal hyde to cure a sprained ankle contributed to the success of realism! Finally, this movie integrated different cultures whom all of which lived on the same rock, to provide stereotypes in a metaphorical way through character usage (ie: the whites were the main bastards who refused to speak English, the black guys provided home cookin', and the Hispanics/Muslims showed their violent nature and urge to cross over into others land).All in all, this movie sucked. It tried way too hard to leave the viewer on the edge of their seat, where it left me huddled in the corner wanting to be sacrificed just to get out and go to Panera Bread. The action scenes would leave a 12 year old who has been munching on skittles for 3 hours to sleep, and it is a perfect example of the word ""HISTORICALLY INACCURATE"".However, if you wish to see Steven Strait in a loin cloth, be my guest and pay with $12.50 and 109 minutes of your life.","10,000 BC"

Don't get so upset over corny movies. Of course 10,000 BC can't be taken seriously! It's about cavemen who live on the top of mountains, hunt woolly mammoths and fight giant man-eating birds! However, even though it's cheesy and doesn't have a very engaging plot, I still thought it was a fun movie. The special effects were terrific! The whole reason I went was to see the woolly mammoths. And do you know what? They looked awesome! On top of that, it was clean enough for families to go see. Maybe not too young of kids because of all the violence; but the movie had no swearing or sexual situations. It is definitely a fun movie to see. See it in theaters to fully appreciate the epic grandeur of the woolly mammoth!","10,000 BC"
347,gendreau_neil,An entertaining fable (as a matter of perspective),7,8 March 2008,"It's best to view this movie with the proper expectations. It certainly wasn't designed to be a realistic or historically accurate portrayal of the times, but better serves as a mythological tale of human struggle as experienced by a fictional tribe somewhere North of the Himalayan mountains, and what they were able to learn from the interaction of their leader D'hel while on his journey with other tribes to recapture their people who were taken as slaves by a more advanced civilization.Yes there are many inconsistencies with this film as it relates to time, place, and languages spoken. Even more amusing is the existence of jungle roaming, carnivorous ostriches (which never existed), along with sabre tooth tigers and wooly mammoths that had long been extinct. What is to be appreciated from this movie is the struggle of mankind against each other, including personal insecurities, overcome by co-operation of those who developed a vested interest to unite and vanquish a common enemy. In this respect, the movie should be compared with those challenges faced throughout history which continue to this day.Some other embellishments include the protagonist and his modest crew crossing the Himalayas while keeping pace with ""the demons with four legs"" (Egyptians on horseback) who captured their villagers, including the cherished Evolet. The extreme distance of their journey by far exceeds the possible range covered these peoples, who though nomadic, usually never wandered more than a few hundred square miles from their origins. Despite harsh realities, we witness their grim meanderings across the Himalayas, through Indian jungles, across the Middle East, and lastly as they join forces with African tribes along the Nile, even while dragging their injured. A journey of this magnitude would not have been possible for another 5,000 years until Mesopotamians had domesticated horses in the first place.However, considering the movie for its context rather than its content, 10,000 B.C. becomes an intriguing diversion, and a more realistic entertainment alternative than reality television.","10,000 BC"

351,trinityk9,What?,2,9 March 2008,"This movie was like Days of Our Lives meets the Flintstones. The acting and actors were questionable as well as the ethnicity. As children they have tanned colored skin and then as adults they look like white Abercrombie models (all the warriors' boobs kept jiggling). Geologically it didn't make any sense. They seem to be the only Caucasian tribe amongst Africans and Egyptians. Not only that but it would make much more sense to have the protagonist's tribe to speak a different dialect than English. That's probably just me but it just seemed strange that everyone else spoke in subtitles. The CG looked like something out of a video game, it even skipped at one point! The saber tooth and other animals were comical. The plot lacking. The costumes and make-up was about the only thing interesting. Although the villain was kinda cool until he was miraculously stabbed with a spear from a mile away (didn't see that coming). I think the worst was Camilla Belle's acting and how she just seemed so out of place. I was waiting for the phone to ring throughout the movie. So yeah, that was a wasted two hours of my life.","10,000 BC"
352,akovacs-2,Is this the worst film ever made?,1,15 March 2008,"I've never been inspired to comment on a film, and if I haven't seen every film ever released in the cinema, I must have seen most of them on DVD. However, but after suffering this ""epic"", I feel that unless I can find a way to purge the trauma from my psyche I may well never be able to set foot in a cinema again without terrifying flashbacks that bring me out in a cold sweat and have me scrabbling around on the floor of the cinema foraging for stale bits of pop-corn. In fact, talking through this experience may well be the first step on my long road to mental recovery.Most films have at least one redeeming moment so, as an optimist, I've never actually got up and walked out of a movie. I wished I had during the first (and second and third) episode of the second trilogy of Star Wars movies, which was so memorable I forget the title, but an unpleasant feeling - that precious moments of my life were ticking away, and that they could be much better spent waiting an hour in the rain for the bus home - began just after the opening credits of 10.000 BC.I know 10.000 BC is a fantasy, and it wouldn't have surprised me at all if the writer based all his historical facts on Looney Tunes cartoons so, when I sat down, I was prepared to suspend all my beliefs about what life ten thousand years ago might have been like. This being so the dreadlocks, multi-cultural tribes and anthropomorphic animals only upset me a little. Also, I still haven't fathomed out how a star can be used to find the mouth of a river, or how ten men on horseback can conquer tribes of hundreds of well armed warriors, or how our hero can get in and out of slave camps when the slaves cant. Finally, I was more than a little miffed that the action, fight scenes and CGI graphics didn't even try and convince me that the fact the film had virtually no plot didn't matter.Now, what I really, really cant get my head round is how supposedly intelligent ""professionals"" can a) come up with such one dimensional, stupid screenplay and then b) get some other supposedly intelligent ""professionals"" to fork out $100 million and finally c) get dozens of supposedly ""intelligent"", ""professional"" actors to ""act"" without someone, somewhere putting up a hand and saying: ""Er, guys, excuse me, but this really isn't very good is it?"".

I recommend this film to anyone who would enjoy watching an Epic story of tribes people, the conflict they suffer and a genuine scenario which portrayed the essence of our human spirit, which can unify all to conquer an evil. The film goes to town with prophecies, psychic ability and this is backed up by a solid sequence during the film which you may let slide for the sake of enjoying the film. With both factual and fictional elements combined, i expected to see a number of flaws, to my surprise there were none that were immediately obvious. (Such as the voices, which sounded very cool to me) When creating a language from scratch its always hard, but they did it right. At the end, he fights for his lady, wins.

Don't know if what I say qualifies as a 'spoiler', - not intended - but will find out one way or the other. OK. 10,000BC. Yes, the beginning and the end had some mammoths - good effects by the way. Two short appearances by a sabre tooth. One scene I had to keep rewinding to see again and again. An injured person was being given water from a skin bottle with what could be nothing other than a pop-top sports bottle mouthpiece. Pre-historic animals, fancy jewelery, fancy carved steel knives, pyramids, fancy clothing using flimsy brightly coloured fabrics, wheels, mascara stained cheeks...........I could keep going. More like 10,000 years of evolution all rolled into one - but without making a lot of sense. And why the different languages - often hard to hear even the 'English'. Having said that, it is just a love story with a poor attempt at making it some sort of action/war/retaliation type story. Not good.

355,lisa-di-meo,10000 reasons not to watch this film (spoilers),1,17 May 2008,"I watched this film last night, and I'm still in shock as to how terrible it was! This is easily the worst film I have seen in years, in fact it's possibly the worst film made in the last 10000 years.It started off looking promising, but went downhill after just a few minutes. There is so much to slate about this film I'm not sure where to start. The acting is awful, and is made much worse by the accents. This film could have been improved with subtitles, but I'm guessing that would make it too much like Apocalypto, which it is a blatant and cheap knock-off of. The characters don't have any character, for example the leading lady does nothing but stand around wide-eyed. The tribe of hunters that the story revolved around were clearly not given much thought when the script was being written. They live in the mountains in winter, and try to catch mammoths using a net, that's about all we got to find out about them. They have tried to compensate for the lack of depth with aesthetics, but looking like cavemen doesn't make up for talking like idiots and acting like poorly trained boy-scouts.Aspects of the pitiful plot which could have been explored in greater detail were skimmed over, like the main characters search for his father, which was only mentioned in a few terse sentences, and would have been better of not mentioned at all as the whole topic made the film even more ridiculous.The main character walks for days and manages to come across tribes of every colour, that speak totally different languages. If this isn't ridiculous enough we find that one of them speaks perfect English because he met the main characters father.After the sabre-tooth tiger is saved from drowning, it saves the lead from a tribe of spear wielding warriors, as if this wasn't laughable enough, the stick painting on a boulder which predicted the event had me in stitches!Other things that made me laugh at this pathetic film: - the strand of leather with bones on it that the lead spent years making for his love interest! - the slowest moving boats ever seen, and nobody thought to follow them! - the scar that spontaneously appeared on the blue-eyed girl and looked like she had stuck her hand in a bramble patch! - the 'sacrifice' - the old lady dying at the end to save the blue-eyed girl! - the young boy avenging his mothers death and missing when he threw his spear! - the 'blind-man' who sounded like Marlon Brando in The Godfather (and also met the leads father)! I nearly wet myself because I was laughing so hard at that part!Please, do NOT waste your time or your money on this AWFUL film!!!","10,000 BC"
356,fender-17,Didn't think it was that bad,7,25 October 2008,"Actually, I thought it was pretty good. People are just too hard to please these days. How many historical movies actually follow true history? And if they didn't speak English, the movie would suck. Really, what languages do you think would have been spoken there? You wouldn't have recognized a single one. Movies have been made like that for a long time. Otherwise, we'd be reading subtext the whole movie. My biggest knock on it is that it could have used a bit more action. The final battle was way too short. They also could have focused more on how the main character came to be the leader that he was. However, for the most part, I found it entertaining. I don't intend to give my kids a history lesson over it, but it was entertaining all the same.","10,000 BC"
357,creativeangel2007,Kinda Lame...,3,26 September 2008,"I have to admit, I was fairly disappointed when I saw this. My older sister had said it was really good, and when I saw the trailer I had though ""oh something unique"" It wasn't until I started watching the movie that I was met by a few surprises, foremost the fact that the attempt to make it historically accurate failed miserably. From too pretty characters (come on, as if any one of them would that facial structure if it was actually 10 000 BC) to the fact that all kinds of races that shouldn't have existed in the same place had been mushed together in one plot. There was speech when there shouldn't have been speech, but on top of that, the dialogue was not the greatest (to put it nicely), and the creatures, my gawd. During the jungle scene and the so-called suspense of those big things in grass that make odd noises and eat people, I burst out laughing once they were revealed as big clumsy turkeys.Knowing my sister though, she probably fell for the overall ""sweetness"" of D'Leh and his attempts to rescue his beautiful girlfriend Evolet (how typical). It has to be said, not many guys I know would do that these days. (This is the nice section of the review by the way). Some parts were cute and laughable, such as the scene when the tiger is first introduced.Overall, I was very disappointed in this movie, but I find if you don't think about it at all (no history, no accuracy) then it's bearable to sit through. Kind of.","10,000 BC"
358,wrtlbrmftt,"10,000 BC, Movie, Roland Emmerich, Sven Littkowski",4,15 October 2008,"This movie is a classical example what happens if a film maker with not much historic knowledge gets a big budget to make a film like this.In brief, this film can still go as fantasy movie, but the title ""10,000 BC"" indicates unfortunately that this film would have some relation to a real time in our history. Good are the adventures, the action scenes, and the very colorful images in this movie.Otherwise, so many things in this movie are shown in such a totally wrong way, that the title better should have been something like ""In a Country Called Oz"", or something else what indicates it is purely unrealistic fiction.During the movie, a white man from Europe (well, I am a white guy, too) walks a few steps and is suddenly deep in Africa, where the black man sees this white man as the hero from their legends. So, this white man unites suddenly many African tribes, and even a big dangerous animal is friend with him. Like in real life 10,000 BC...In this movies, large continents shrink down to the sizes of maybe a few hundred kilometers, instead of thousands. Ships during that time didn't have the size of an oil tanker as shown in one of the last scenes in this movie (but due the nature of lumber a wooden ship cannot be much longer than 100 or 120 meters), and also had not many masts with sails. Also, the earliest masts of Egyptian ships were been of entirely different construction. Also, the lateen sail as seen in another scene on the Nile was not known at that time. It came in use by around BC 300 to BC 200. And in addition, the sails were totally out of any proportions so that the ships look more like a giant butterfly than a ship.And at that time, Egyptians were not yet pyramid builders.With other words, this movie was done by someone without much education about those times, and obviously without good consultancy. The movie lacks logic, but is on the other hand rich on colorful images and adventures as mentioned before. Watch this movie, if you don't care much for an intelligent or authentic movie. As pure fantasy this movie can work well. Just don't use your brain. The title is misleading.","10,000 BC"

Can't do that? Well then be cool. Just before the movie debuted, we get a Discovery Channel program that says that blue eyes came from the Caucus about 10-15,000 BC. The idea that the Sphinx was carved in 10,000 BC supports this story line, nicely. The innovative idea that the ancients used Mammoths to move the cyclopean blocks was intriguing. Setting up the antagonist as a fugitive from Atlantis was good. New Flash! Unless you've gone to Area 51 and time traveled you do not know how these people lived with great detail. There are indications that Tribes, like Amer-Indians, consisted of 100-200 people. That would be 25-50 adult hunters. Remember child mortality. Someone with blue eyes is still regarded with some fascination, even today  let alone 10,000 years ago. I have studied history for 40 years and thought I'd seen it all. But the only thing that I can say with certainty is that we are in for more surprises about how the ancients lived and their accomplishments. Someone had to build Baalbek and Tiahuanaco. Who were the Red-haired large Caucasians in China in 3,000 BC spoken about on National Geographic? Keep an open mind! Only ""old fogies"" like me are supposed to be closed-minded and wrapped up in our own Pride. When I was in history in the 1960s, we were taught that the Chinese did pictograph writing and gun powder, etc but nothing like what the History Channel has been releasing this year about how advanced they were technologically. So, you see, you don't know it all about what happened then and you can't until you either time travel or dig it up.","10,000 BC"
364,wordsallowmotion,What was That!!!!!!!!!,2,9 March 2008,"After reading some of the posts on this movie I was kind of expecting the posts not to be true. I attended the screening of the movie this Sunday, what I was expecting a fun, spectacular animated movie along the theme of Ice Age but more a dramatic flare to it. I was expecting to see more animals of that time period, and a story of working them in with a small nomadic tribe on some kind of goal. I was hoping to see some kind of movie that involved the Bering Strait and the migration of animal and humans into North America. I thought this might happen, but I was way off my movie hope. I was hoping the Saber Tooth tiger would actually do some ripping and shredding, but alas, no such thing happened (plus I wanted to see more of the big cat, but at most around 2 minutes of it...blah). Reality crossed with fiction, religion, and spirituality? This movie is mostly comes down to human conflict with some animation. All in all, I was disappointed with many aspects of the movie storyline. I just couldn't get into the characters emotions, and sometimes the music score was bothersome to me. Next time give me more animal story with some added human element. ********************************* I Love That Effing Zippyhttp://www.clickflick.com/index.php?cat=Black_Comedy","10,000 BC"
365,edisonoside2004,"10,000 B.C. Not all bad.",3,18 March 2008,I went to see this movie with very low expectations and walked out a satisfied movie goer. Even though I am not a Roland Emmerich fan I think this is his best film so far. After a slow start the movie slowly picks up momentum and one finds himself whisked away and caring for the characters in the movie. I liked the hidden meaning the movie offers about gathering together to fight the ones who oppress..Impressive to see cave people of all creeds come together in an organized way and with a strong instinctive leader to help free an embattled people. The ancient Egyptians were kind of creepy and other worldly and our heroes very human and full of love for one another..The movie will please if given a chance.,"10,000 BC"
366,Genglemt,Bubble-gum-fluff for your brain,3,13 July 2013,"There is always a choice when you place a work of fiction in historic or pre-historic times. You can either strive for the authentic, and try to be as historically correct as possible, matching your fiction with what historians and scientists have to say about your chosen era.Or you can choose the route of Emmerich, which might be described as the kid-in-a-toy-store approach: Hang the facts and pilfer away anything that seems cool or fun, that you could work into your story. Clearly Emmerich doesn't want to think about historical accuracy. Mammoths look cool in the desert, so much cooler than ordinary elephants would. So he will have mammoths. And so on.The advantage of using the first approach as a framework for fiction, is that by setting your story within a historical frame with the limits of that particular time, you inherit a lot of interesting possibilities for struggle and drama within the historical limits. How would a person live, survive, be successful in a certain historical era, with all that we know about that particular time? That could be a great source for drama, and could be an interesting concept for a film, but clearly this concept does not appeal to Emmerich at all.The advantage of the second approach, the kid-in-a-toy-store approach, is that you can have all the goodies that you can think of from historical, pre-historical and non-historical times (fiction). Clearly this is what Emmerich is after. Emmerich's films are typically stuffed with cool stuff, big stuff, flashy stuff. I forget how many times he has destroyed New York.. But that is what Emmerich is about, he is a fun loving kitsch machine, cranking out time killers for anyone who likes this kind of flashy hodgepodge.This film should not be judged on historical premises, is should be judged on the premise of how well the storytelling works. How well does the internal logic of the story hold up, does it work as a story? As it happens, the story is basically about good-tribal-warrior-types, versus evil-empire-type-civilization (in essence the premise here is by-the-numbers auto-pilot civilization critique. Tribal authenticity=good, organized society=bad. Back to nature, and all that). Within that framework, the film does exactly what one would expect, using basic and well worn cliché characters to tell a corny story we've all heard before. It does nothing to rise above our expectations, it does not in any way surprise us. Noble savages act in noble ways. And scummy power mad villains are evil, but will they get their comeuppance in the end? The hero is a true hero, but will he get the girl? Will the noble warrior types be freed from tyranny? But never mind. It's very easy to pick holes in this construction, as it is not very solid. But it wasn't meant to be solid. This is bubble-gum-fluff for your brain, if you like that sort of thing. I don't, and if found the film almost unwatchable. I liked the terror birds though. So for that bit of pretty cgi, I give it a 3.","10,000 BC"
367,zoodlepepsee,"In a word ""Juvinelle""",4,24 January 2014,"I've read a lot of comments that defend this movie on the fact that it is meant to be fiction and does not need to be historically accurate but then why is it still such a ""Groaner"". Fiction is a great genre but still requires a form of believability that this film utterly lacks. It presumes it's audience as very simple minded. (are you?) The movie showed early promise in the build up to a mammoth hunt but when we are asked to believe that a prehistoric tribe hunting with stick's, rocks and bones could pick and choose who would perform the actual kill (""piercing of the heart"" as they called it) of such a powerful beast. Humph.. Hollywood would rather feed you their formulated ONE man hero story than to pay even the slightest attention to anything realistic or believable. The hunters (as a group) would be very lucky to even kill a mammoth without some being killed themselves. Hello, go try to kill a rampaging bull elephant with a stick..lol After this the groans and disappointments come repeatedly. If you like an over-simplified story that follows the rigid Hollywood recipe of leading man/hero unrealistically conquers overwhelming odds/ gets beautiful girl/ demonstrates magical fantasy idealism/ leaves you feeling very uninspired,then see this. Rule one of fiction writing. The best fiction first ""convinces"" realism!!.","10,000 BC"

It has a lot of beautiful panned scenes and a story that at times can be uplifting, other times tense and still some of the time you aren't really sure what to think or feel.It seems to me that many people are watching this movie expecting a historical account. It's not at all that, it's more of a typical Hollywood epic fantasy and if you watch it expecting that, it doesn't disappoint nearly as much.I enjoyed the story on the basis of pure fiction. The characters were exotic and the growth of their personal relationships toward each other was fun to watch. I think it tied things together well toward the end, simple concepts become much larger. Overall, it's not terrible but it's not mind blowing either. I'd recommend it to anyone who wouldn't try to take it too seriously.","10,000 BC"
369,gollor,Not a Bad Movie,8,23 March 2008,"****** Minor Spoilers ***** Not a great movie either. But evidently it caught peoples attention good and bad. #1 movie in America at the time of writing this comment: Horton Hears a Who: 44 comments. The movie that umpteen billions of jumped-up snobby fanboys hate: 254 comments. Get a grip people, it's just a friggin movie. It didn't set out to change the frakkin world. It was (to me at least) designed as a fantasy and not to make some kind of world shaking comment on life in 10000 BC. 10000 BC does seem like a safe place to set a fantasy it's not like we have 10 tons of art and written descriptions of life back then to tell us exactly how it was. Although, using the mammoths to haul big stone bricks in the desert did seem a stretch - but for those of you who missed it: it looked like mammoth bones D'Leh found in the sand near the pyramid builders. This did indicate builders had gone thru quite a few of them. This indicated to me that the builders could see mammoths in the desert were probably a bad idea, but acted in desperation. It also connects to the lateness of the mammoths arriving in D'Leh's tribe's territory.Like a lot of things in this movie the choices made by the film's makers were made in the context of a fantasy...and they made good choices for fantasy films - OTOH if this had been an archaeological documentary they should have been shot back at the studio when they asked for film.Luckily they did not get shot, and they did make a heck of a good fantasy movie. The acting was not Oscar par, but it was good and the actors did a good job of dealing with the movies themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and justice.So to all the fan boys bitching about this movie, sod off...you made you're noise, you didn't change anyone's opinions, time to move on to your next scheduled whining.","10,000 BC"

A group of hunters are attacked, with many of their tribe taken. The few remaining men decide to go after those that are taken. D'leh (well-cast with Steven Strait)wants to get back the woman he loves. Much of the movie is the quest, but the CGI was beautiful, and the shots were well done.

No. Is it a thinly veiled romanctic film akin to Braveheart? NO Is it a gore fest? No. The CGI is NOT that good and rather uninspired. I'd rewatch Jurassic Park and still be in awe compared to this. This movie never made up what it wanted to be. Not that it ever got that far. The climax which is perhaps the only redeeming factor ends so horrifically stupid.

In fact it's a bait and switch when the script is no more powerful if not less than a Conan movie in '85.Last year Fox release a movie similar in fashion about vikings called Pathfinder and it didn't do well. I can at least repsect Fox for not telling the potential viewers we're giving you roast beef for dinner and bringing Kentcuky Friend Chicken to the table, because the filmmakers of 10,000 B.C. told us we're having roast beef and brought a bologna sandwich to the table....with an olive and a tooth pick.I'll give it a four only because it wasn't gory like the Jurassic Park movies and it didn't display the unnecessary sexuality some primitive setting movies have, but I feel deceived and I think the filmmakers knew what they were doing.","10,000 BC"

I understand all the negative reviewing of this movie, i really do, but i think that people are reading to much into the movie itself and not looking at the big picture. OK, yeah, there was no English in 10 000 bc, human colonies didn't interact like that at all, the geography is way off and basically makes no sense, and almost everything about the movie was illogical and nonfactual. With this said, does it really matter? It tells the invigorating story of not only human evolution, but human revolution. It presents an epic civil uprising. An abolishment of tyranny and with giant wholly mammoths running down a pyramid. i'd say thats pretty cool. It loosely tells the story we all know. The same story that can be told for the Russian Revolution, the French Revolution, The Chinese Revolution, etc... Its about the oppressed coming together for the common goal of change. Not unlike Barack Obama's campaign promise. But i digress, I know i shouldn't really compare this obviously bad movie to the many human revolutionary accomplishments in history, but i can't help it. It's movies like these, movies about human achievement (take away sabretooth tigers, giant ostrich thingys, wholly mammoths, the beyond sappy love story) that represent the essence of human existence. Another example of this would be 300 representing human bravery and loyalty (except in this case the epic overpowered anything negative to make it truly epic).that is all.","10,000 BC"

It was, in a word, awful. The dialogue was incredibly bad, the acting wooden (however, with a script that bad, you can't really blame the actors too much; I suppose they did their best), the plot clichéd. It borrowed most of the aforementioned plot (minus the action, drama and ability to hold your attention) from ""Apocalypto"", a film I have not seen but have read a lot about. The only part of the film that moved it up from a ""one"" to a ""two"" at any point was the near-ending, in which Evolet (played by the unfortunately bland Camilla Belle, which is a shame because I actually like her as an actress normally) is killed. It was not as passionate or emotive as it was supposed to be, but left me thinking: ""All right, at least they managed to round it off with a half-decent ending"", but then they had to twist it around to a ""happy"" ending in which the Old Mother sacrificed her life to save Evolet. That left me feeling furious and cheated more than anything, and took the film right down to a ""one"" score again.","10,000 BC"

In my opinion this movie deserves a score way better then it has at this moment. It's not an Oscar winner, but it's a good movie for you to watch it with you're family. The cast could be better, but they manage to get you hooked up to the screen, and the scenery is the best part of the movie. You can see allot of different set's, and all of them well made. The fact that they appear to fast, one after another can be pretty boring for those that watch this as an historical movie.

Knowing he is not the 'one' D'Leh battles within himself and against the slave traders to seek freedom for his people.This is a great title for Blu Ray the scenery and action scenes are mind blowing, with footage from South Africa, Namibia, Thailand and the beautiful New Zealand. It would have been easy for this type of movie to go overboard with mammoth and other animal CGI but it was used well.Reviewers have criticised the accuracy of the movie and no doubt its historically inaccurate but seriously people lighten up - its a movie! It doesn't claim to be based on a true story and the use of English is great, with so much action I would hate to be reading through the subtitles.Personally I feel this is a great movie for the family. It stays quite light and graphical violence is kept within the bounds of a spear being thrown into someone with some resulting blood on clothing.Overall a great Hollywood movie, outstanding scenery, solid character development which builds into a faster paced epic struggle for freedom.","10,000 BC"

To bring the bad news, I'd be delighted. 10,000 BC was shameful. You can think of it like this. If you took the ham from a ham sandwich, the pickle from a ploughman's sandwich, the cheese, the mango and the (hell with it) black truffle mayonnaise from their great tasting recipes then made your own out of it you'd turn out with something quite foul. If the recipe was presented to you by a reputable chef such as Jamie Oliver, your expectation of the sandwich would be of good quality. After sampled however, your reaction towards Jamie Oliver who is looking down at you excitedly at his new creation is to: 1. Chuck the contents of your mouth at his fat greased up face. 2. Eject the contents on your mouth onto his trouser leg. 3. Kick him in the 'junk'.So to review quickly, it's taken the original aspects of other great films and produced a foul film out of it. The script hurt, the story was slop, the CGI I don't ever care for but that couldn't redeem it from the stupid characters, stupid names (Tic'Tic...) and the most bothersome ending.Credit to the sound and visual effects guys.

Or maybe Mesolithic. Emmerich, who's already done alien invasion (Independence Day) and environmental Armageddon (The Day After Tomorrow), excels at staging grand-scale chaos, but he's no stickler for detail.

Do not read unless you wish to know about pivotal events in the film) Lets get this straight, this is clearly no historical epic. The film is inaccurate in portraying human history, the pyramids were not due for another 5000 years( by then D'leh and Evolet would look like mummies), sabertooths and those giant terrorbirds were extinct. The Pharoah and his priests did not dress like that and modern humans did not speak English.However, he got the mammoths right, they were going to be around for a few thousands more. It would be near impossible to find out what early humans spoke. Having them say "" Ooohh oohh aaahh aaahh"" for most of the film is really going to annoy people. The reason they speak English is because we're seeing it from they're point of view. If they spoke like apes, I'm pretty sure only infants would understand them. Accuracy aside, the film is alright. The actors are fine, Camilla Belle does well enough to portray Evolet without being annoying. Steven Strait is better as D'leh. The cast is OK, good work done from a bunch of unknowns. The special effects could be better , I was not fooled by the Sabertooth tiger but its commendable. This film does not use exposure of the female body to draw men. Camilla is hot enough to be sexy fully clothed. In conclusion, this film is not a great but its a good film, exceeding my expectations as it could make me feel like crying when Evolet was shot by an arrow in the back by a jealous lover. This proves its not like 300( I felt nothing for the Spartans who died). So stop this constant bashing of the film because it fails to show the Ice Age accurately( and One Million BC got their facts, right.)","10,000 BC"

Girl Gets Captured by Crazed Maniac who is in love with girl as well. Man sets out after her, and somehow finds army on the way. Randomly Free's Slaves (who of course fight with him). Man Gets girl. Bad guy does the good old ""if i can't have her no one can"". But oh wait it still all works out in the end. YAY! Besides that......Their was the udder Cheesiness (which made me roll my eyes about every ten minutes)and the fact that everyone was so witty and well endowed with knowledge back then (who would of imagined?) This movie was horrible and i suggest not seeing it, i paid $0 to see it and I still i feel like i wanted something back...Anything! if not the roughly two hours i wasted sitting in that seat. Ugggggh.....","10,000 BC"
390,garaidh_2000,"I spy with my little eye....Swiss, Eskimos, Arabs, Egyptians, Indians, Native Americans, Celts, Zulus, Masai, Ethiopians....",1,19 March 2008,"The film starts by introducing us to a Multi-culti tribe in Switzerland (?) led by a shaman eskimo woman. They seemed to have forgotten that prehistoric hunter gatherers generally wandered around and fill instead their days by waiting all year in their village for mammoths to meander by and kill one for food which luckily lasts all year. Their 'noble' existence is shattered by some Arab horsemen looking for slaves. They leave the Alps into the jungles (!) of Italy(?) where they are attacked by birds which once lived in South America. The scenery changes to Utah as they track the slavers into Africa. They meet some Zulu tribes who happened to have bumped into the Swiss hunter's father and who somehow managed to teach the Zulu tribe the one language that seems to exist in Europe. The Arab desert slavers have attacked the zulus too so the Swiss and the zulus combine forces to attack the slavers. Rather than follow the river (the Nile?) to the slave town, they decide to cross the Sahara (after all there's no food or water by a river so this would seem a sensible option!).After wandering around for weeks they look to the stars and decide to follow the North Star (the slave city, in common with Santa's hideaway is under it apparently). Hey ho, after a few days they find slave city and it turns out to be a pyramid construction site led by an alien. Luckily, the crafty alien god has lots of slaves and a ready source of desert living woolly mammoths to help build his pyramid. Swiss hunter cries 'operation desert freedom' and the slaves rebel. The alien god's Indian eunuchs (fresh out of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom)and some albino africans flee to a giant ship stored in a pyramid but the rebelling slaves catch them up and kill the giant alien who turns out to be 'Lurch' from the Adams family. Eskimo woman then dies back in the Alps to bring Swiss hunters girlfriend back to life in the Sahara (she's prophetic as shes got blue eyes - apparently rare we're led to believe in Switzerland). The film ends with the desert dwelling Zulus giving the Swiss crops which somehow grew in the Sahara. The Swiss then set off home surely cursing that they set Lurch's giant boat alight as it surely would have speeded up their journey across the Mediterranean. They have a group hug back in the Alps when their desert crops begin to grow at the foot of a glacier...Needless to say I won't be buying the DVD","10,000 BC"
391,shaunissey,A bad rip-off,4,10 March 2008,"This movie, is at BEST a bad rip-off of the 300, Apocalypto, and Jurassic Park, without any of the redeeming elements of the above films. The plot was derived directly form the 300 in an almost painfully obvious manner, complete with the exact ending(man says he agrees with emperor, throws spear at emperor, etc.). The people, seem to have come from apocalypto, with similar styles, and methods, however instead of speaking in a native tongue, they speak in a horrible, broken-English that sounds one minute like a Spanish accent, the next like a Russian one. The creatures, at least some of the(namely the half-ostrich, half-raptor appears to be designed based off of steven spielberg's adaptation of Jurassic Park, without any of the seamless special effect work that made the aforementioned believable. Bottom line, if you want an empty plot that brings together parts of the above mentioned films from which it was seemingly derived, without being half as good as any of them(which is saying a lot in the case of apocalypto) then watch this film, but at least save your money until it is on video. If you find yourself looking for a good film, pass this one up.","10,000 BC"

I figure if these guys speak English, walk across the world in a month and mammoths are pulling stones for the egyptians then dinosaurs can talk.

I normally come here to review the movies before I go, but since this was opening day for the movie in this locale I made a tactical error that cost me my $. Some of the CGI was passable but the overall movie is bad. It was a poorly written piece and on top of that the movie dragged on. I was looking at my watch less than 30 minutes in. What struck me as odd was having what amounted to cave people speaking excellent English and the bad guys speaking who knows what. Then throw in a Sabre Tooth Tiger who apparently is smarter than the humans and top it off with man eating giant chickens!!! And that is pretty much the high point of this canine!","10,000 BC"
394,wita-1,The movie was entertaining and a perfect film for the a boring weekend,8,20 March 2008,"Though the movie was not supposed to be particularly 'Amusing' but to Me and my friend it was for we left completely jazzed, partially because of the two gallons of coke intake which we had consumed during the film but also because we had just seen a movie which was not scary but Intriguing. We did not have a full cinema so we we were able to comment on the film and there was nothing particularly 'gory' about it. It was not extremely accurate, since particularly in the last scenes the dressing was very modern, but no matter I personally enjoyed it just because it enlightened a very boring day. It's a family friendly film with various genres of entertainment, it has some action/adventure, some drama and some love(Not literally). It does not have to be a film you sit down to and completely commit to, for it is easy to catch up to when you are busy talking to a friend. Overall it was a very enjoyable film recommended for a dreary weekend.","10,000 BC"
395,zombieking101,In a nutshell...,2,6 April 2008,"...I fell asleep during this movie... that's all I have to say.I have enjoyed the majority of Emmerich's films, but this was just so clumsy and all over the place, I know he could've done a much better job. It was one of those films where I didn't know what I was watching (a love story, an action movie, a distracting hybrid, etc). I was so surprised to discover all of the inaccuracies in it as well (which I truthfully didn't have a clue about any of, so that won't ruin most people's fun) and I thought that this film could've been given a lot more time, brains and effort. It seems that the main selling point throughout was the CGI and that everything else was just filler, but not even the CGI saved this movie for me, despite it all obviously being of great quality. It just had no impact. To me, it felt like there was no motive behind it, nothing driving it, it was just one scene after the other and I soon stopped caring for the characters and the action, I just wasn't interested. The only point at which I perked up was after I'd woken up and the final scene was playing. I actually began to enjoy it slightly, but if only the entire film had been this way, then I'd have been happy with it. Even here it was tagged with a ridiculous ending.I don't know what else to say about this movie. It had ridiculous dialogue, didn't give what it promised and had got it all wrong. Anyone who just wants ""bubble gum for the eyes,"" give it a try, whereas I personally have not recommended this film to any of my friends and would not be fussed at all if I never see it again.","10,000 BC"
396,martinfixman,A very science fiction movie,1,6 March 2008,"OK, lets start with what I actually understood on this movie: On 10.000 BC (BP), the planets aligned, forming a time warp hole, and so that made that Mammoths (extinct in 12.000 BC) lived at the same time that Sumerians (7.000 BC) that build pyramids (6.000 - 5.000 BC) that had shape of Egyptian pyramids (3000 BC) and used telescopes (1608 AC) to see the (south hemisphere) stars. Besides that, there were other tribes that used bronze (3.000 BC) and iron (2.000 BC) on their weapons, and cultivated corn (American), that had magical properties and made that, in one year, ice age magically disappeared.I thought these a warp hole only appeared on the middle age during Tale of a Knight, but they seem to be very older.Now, if you like Battlestar Galactica or other science fiction, you will actually LOVE this movie!","10,000 BC"

Needless to say, I was really, really disappointed. I went to see it despite the bad reviews...but had I stayed home, I would have added 2-hours to my weekend and saved $18. It was that bad, and you knew it about 10 minutes in to the movie....The plot was lame, the person who said Jurassic Park had better CGI was right (and that was about 15 years ago), and the whole movie was confusing in geography and anachronisms....I mean, where in the world can you cross mountains, end up in the rain forest and then wander sand dunes within a matter of days on foot? Domesticated woolly mammoths? really? in a desert setting? The movies lacks knowledge of history, geography and biology. All of which would have been tolerable with a decent plot, a reasonable script and even a minor attempt at character development.

398,Irish_Girl81,Put history out of your mind for the length of the movie.,10,10 March 2008,"I recently had the pleasure of going to see the movie 10,000 B.C. and while I had heard the bad reviews it had gotten, I put them out of my mind while watching it. I must say that, despite the bad reviews it got, it was an amazing movie. So what if it was historically inaccurate? It's a movie and it is meant for entertaining purposes. If it was meant to be historically accurate, it would have been a documentary. This is a movie that you must be able to put actual history- which can sometimes be recorded inaccurately itself- out of your mind when you watch it. If you can put history out of your mind for the length of the movie then it is a must see. If you cannot, then don't watch it because it will be disappointing to you.","10,000 BC"

Some of the script came straight off the back of a cornflake box and the rest was dug up from the graves of the star wars prequels. I cant even fathom how this even went into production, its a case of you'll probably need to watch it to believe how wrong they got it! There were a couple of moments that really made us laugh, but in a film that is taking itself seriously, I don't think it was supposed to be funny? Or maybe I missed the whole point of the film? To summarise, don't waste your money, either watch appocalypto again or just give a donation to charity instead, you'll feel far better!!!","10,000 BC"
400,quel-sac-affreux,"Like 'Apocalypto', except it wasn't lame.",7,12 April 2008,"When one walks into a cinema to watch a movie like this, one shouldn't be expecting a historically accurate, emotional film with a deep meaning. One should be expecting a large plate of kickassery drenched in awesome-sauce with a pretty girl on the side, because that's exactly what you're getting. Yes, there are a lot of things that don't make sense, like growing desert crops in tundra climate, mammoths in the desert or there actually BEING a tundra and a desert right next to each other, but that's not important. 10,000 B.C. is a fantasy adventure movie about the guy wanting the girl, simple as that. The plot doesn't take a lot of twists and turns, because it doesn't need to. We get prophecy about an underdog hero, his princess and his quest to lay down the law for some bad guys and, as in most fantasy flicks, we get to see it come true. Along the way there are twenty-foot man-eating ostriches, a saber-tooth tiger, magic and a mammoth stampede. Really, a mammoth stampede, how much more evidence do you need to tell you that this isn't a movie you watch for the acting but for the awesome?In conclusion, if you saw Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"" and felt that it could've had less hide and seek in the jungle and more hitting each other in the face with sticks, this is the film for you. If you like to read fantasy novels, you will be entertained by this movie. If you're a fan of special effects, you will enjoy this movie. If you're none of the above but all your friends want to see it, there's a really pretty girl (and a lot of beefy men, if that's more your thing)in it to keep you happy while you wait for the mammoth stampede.","10,000 BC"

404,ruithael,"Yes, I give it a Ten. I liked it that much.",10,2 June 2008,"I have read many science fiction stories, and fantasy stories that I considered to be epic, and what I have always found to be the most satisfying experience is one where all parts serve the idea being presented. 10,000 b.c. is a movie that serves this sort of balance very well. It may have anachronism, as many great stories have, and maybe there are movies that have more seamless and realistic animation, as some have pointed out. But I don't see why I should hate this movie, as some have deemed it deplorable. I do not agree with those who have found the movie to be boring or thinly premised. Everything in this movie serves the plot, which is both simple as a love story, and complicated as it reflects a deeper spiritual struggle to recapture the essence of the divine feminine which has been lost to us. When I watch this movie It reminds me of what one might visualize when hearing such a myth spoken around a campfire. It provokes me to thought. The story begins in the tundra, takes us to jungles, wastelands, and through the desert to the remnants of a dying Post-Atlantean civilization. We are given a myth from prehistory, and it is in the mythology that I find the true strength of this movie. I found it very difficult to be bored when so many symbols were popping out of the woodwork. In this story of the hunter and his quest to rescue his love, the whole of civilization is given a new chance. He is prophesied, and so is she. They are prominent symbols in character. Perhaps the scope and range of the story is sickeningly larger than life, but when a story represents the precarious balance of things, even as we see them today, it should be bold. Each conflict seems to blend into the next region and trial in the quest. I find this to be a strength of the film, not a weakness. It seamlessly portrays the consuming burden of the survivalist's struggle as it rolls into the balls out fury of the hunter's quest. He draws nearer to his goal as she is dragged away, and he must find a way to continue, and he does; in an ever growing spiral. As it turns out, it is not their own story, but everyone's. The hero must humble himself and become a tribe, then a nation of tribes, and the enemy progresses from raider to slaver, to an evil god on his mountain. I have been waiting for a movie like this, and I hope more people will take it seriously because of the hard work that was put into it, and the spirit inherent within. If you have not yet seen this movie, try to go into it with an open mind. Taken as it is, a story with great meaning, I think it is more than passable. The heroic struggle has been well represented here in cinematic media. This movie is Epic. I give it an honest 10.","10,000 BC"
405,apowerfuloz,"10,000 B.C was just too vague and simple",4,13 June 2008,"For me this movie was visually appealing, yet sharply declined in the aspect of character development event/action displacement. In other words, the downfall of this movie was its directing. Given a better director this movie could have turned out good, possibly great. The problem for me personally was that A it was just to predictable, and B it seemed to me like even though Evolet was kidnapped as well as other tribe members they never really seemed in any danger. It seemed from the very beginning it was going to be an 'epic' tale of a weak, cowardly soldier who in his effort to rescue his love and his people he becomes courageous, and (key point here) happy ending the two main characters live. Even in the fight scene with Tic Tic and the three enemies, it could have been directed better. There could have been enhanced background audio to hype up his 'fighting' abilities, as well as increase the tragedy of his death. Since Roland Emmerich failed to truly create characters for this movie, the sadness created from his death was short-lived, and didn't do a great job of propelling the point of D'Leh's readiness to be like his father and save his people. Simply if the characters would have been developed more the direness of the kidnapping and rescuing her would have been palpable and would have created a purpose for the movie...but at least it was visually appealing...right.","10,000 BC"
406,asylumlost,a little to much belief suspension,3,2 July 2008,"I didn't find the movie supremely boring so i could give it a 3. I will have to agree with most people who dislike the movie about the acting, though i didn't mind Cliff Curtis, it was horrible. and it had a terrible script, and poor effects. I somewhat disagree on historical accuracies. Going from the concept that this god-king was a Atlantean I can see how the technology is more advanced than what some expect. It is a fairly common theory that survivors of some lost civilization did bring technology and social devices to known early civilizations around the globe. So metal working, domestication of wildlife, boats and large scale engineering projects are plausible in this scope. It is also a fairly well known theory that the sphinx as built much earlier than the pyramids and actually at about 10000bc to be exact. There are other inaccuracies though. The pyramids are fully accepted in every academic circle to have been built when they were. Since we are led to believe this is Egypt, then climate wise its off. the region wasn't a desert at the time. it is widely thought that it was more tropical. The carnivorous birds did come from S. America, sabertooth tigers and mammoths lived in northern climates, though creatures similar to them did live worldwide. The journey seemed to take over a much shorter time span than what would've been possible. The only way the geography fits is if the movie started in the mountains of Ethiopia. The bamboo can even fit this way as we cant say for sure there wasn't some form of it in the area at the time. The problem comes from there needing to be white people or even arabs there at the time. I also don't get what was with the accents. I understand why the use of English and other languages. As an American film i don't see why they couldn't use the standard English they use in other American movies. What really blew it for me though was the seeds they were given to plant. It was corn/maize, which is definitely native to the americas, and would not have been found in any form in eurasia or Africa at the time.","10,000 BC"

It is not a historical narrative of the world as we know it. Neither is Star Wars and everyone loves that. I don't think it aspired to be anything more than a sci-fi movie. It is unfortunate that they named it 10,000 BC because of the implication that this was earth - for all we know it supposedly took place somewhere else 12,000 years ago. So, for a family flick (older kids because of the blood and violence) I thought it was pretty dang good. Really, there were no major holes in the plot, no OMG moments... but I liked Battle Star Galactica (the first series) and Star Trek so sue me.

The main character saves a sabre tooth which later recognises him and decides not to eat him after he whispers to it. Then after about 5 minutes from the ice age their in a desert somehow, and this is after recruiting African tribesmen who somehow cannot stand the heat of their own country and later die, whereas the cave people living in the ice age somehow all survive.This film is possibly the most historically inaccurate film ever made and is absolutely shockingly poor.

414,Kram_industries,"Enjoy it, just don't think too much.",5,6 February 2014,"On the whole I felt this film was average, given my 5/10 rating. This is because as a film it is watchable and you don't really need to think about it. The problem is when you start to think about it, it comes up short. Aesthetically it looks brilliant, the CGI and real world seem to melt together. The Mammoths impose a presence that they obviously do have in reality, which I suppose is down to quite clever acting. Which points to the casting, which was done well, given that relatively unknown actors were used, this added to realism of the film. And I feel a big star would have taken away from that. As far as the narrative goes, apart from the occasional clever twist on things, it doesn't really do much. Typical boy becoming man tale, where he needs to find himself to become the hero. His part in the downfall of the ""Almighty"" felt forced, a needless prophecy just adding to the mix. The villains of the piece felt over the top and given their apparent history unrealistic. The film seemed to try to include every possible culture and just comes across as messy. Ultimately they just felt like parodies. Ah, the dialogue. This film was an original screenplay and it was dull at best. It was messy, with a mixture of Primitive dim dialogue and more modern dialogue in the same conversation, you're left frustrated and wishing they'd just pick one. The language the villains speak sounds ridiculous, more so than any child's attempts to make up their own language. There are three pieces of dialogue that ultimately some up this film: Tic-Tic's ""message"" about people and circles, all in all felt forced and sloppy, there could have been a better way of saying it, much like the film itself. D'leh's battle speech was awful, I imagine the warriors felt worse after hearing it that better. He had the potential to do so much better. Much like the film. And finally, when D'leh has slain the almighty with one throw of his spear he exclaims ""He is not a god!"" This simply emphasises what this film could have been.

415,AJ_Azalea,I was really hoping this would be AT LEAST decent . . .,1,7 March 2008,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*When I saw the trailer for 10,000 BC a while back, it definitely caught my interest simply because I find the beginning of mankind and such to be really interesting. I saw this movie opening night, and from the very first line, I knew that it would suck. The acting wasn't great, the script was terrible, historically inaccurate, and the fact that there was a narrator annoyed me a lot. Some pluses that kept me in the theater for the entire film was the nice sets, costumes, and the fact that the lead (Steven Strait) was VERY nice to look at, lol. Overall, this movie was kinda entertaining from time to time, but it definitely was not worth the price of an admission ticket.","10,000 BC"
416,kirkpflaum-1,Predictable and somewhat amusing.,2,5 March 2008,"Saw this last night at a preview screening, thankfully didn't have to pay for it either - and since these previews are screened to get people like me to give my 2 cents worth to everyone before it opens here goes: As soon as the characters start talking me and my friends started giggling. Poor Cliff Curtis, he is a great actor (see Training Day, Blow, Sunshine) unfortunately, like all the actors, they are thrown into a sea of bad dialog and silly scenes.The story was very predictable, if not the cheesy life giving breath given at the end to bring back one of the characters...that just put it over the top.As for the CGI? I read an interview about how they spent ages working on the effects shots... didn't think they were any better than Transformers, and no where near the level Jackson achieved with Gollum in Lord of the Rings.And one more note on a technical aspect, working in film myself - I have no idea what the cinematographer was thinking, but the film stock used for some of the night scenes was terribly grainy - so much so it distracted me. (maybe because i work in film, or was sitting in second row from the front) But it seemed like this film had a big budget, yet couldn't afford some decent lighting or film stock? hmmmm.Overall, I wouldn't pay to see it. Maybe rent it on DVD and laugh at its shortcomings with your friends.","10,000 BC"
417,ffp61,not at all bad,8,14 March 2008,"I was a little afraid when I went yesterday to see it because I had read all the negative reviews here - and I was pleasantly surprised. This movie is by no means perfect, and some scenes were dragging and left me wondering ""now what was that for..."", but my overall impression is a good one. My main complaint is the title - I expected something more like an pre-historical attempt a la ""Quest for fire"" and got a possible prequel to ""Stargate"", which is not a bad thing since I really like the storyline of ""Stargate"". The mammoths look great, the mass scenes are impressive and pyramids are always good for an ""aaahh..."" :-)","10,000 BC"

Right down there with some of the worst third tier horror moves and even worse when you consider it is represented at least-title -wise, as a film based loosely upon prehistoric events. I never knew that the pyramids were constructed with the aid of woolly mammoths! I can now safely divest myself of all my texts on ancient Egypt and hieroglyphics. Furthermore, the most uninstructed person is aware of the fact that, paper, gold processing and cloth production as well as written language...ships, horses??? did not exist prior to the copper age (which preceded the bronze and iron ages) around 5000 b.c. (earliest traces).We are meant to believe that the hero is a multilingual martial arts expert trained in superior cave man tactics? Save yourself the strain on your eyesight this is a box office flop. Did people actually pay to have their intelligence insulted?Then again I saw one bozo give this flop a 10/10 guess there is no counting for intelligence eh?

420,dpskx,Nice way to learn-from-failure,2,20 May 2008,"Let's look at the silver line here. You don't get a chance to learn these lessons from anywhere else: 1. Mammoths are big, but you don't have to worry. You and another 10 friends can go out there and yell at a herd of hundreds of Mammoths. They will run for there lives without even looking back! Perhaps this idiotically fearful nature of them could be the reason why they extinct. And perhaps, the cast of 10,000 BC could be those who are responsible for just doing that.2. The historic animals (specifically, mammoths, huge vultures and deer) had a slightly different anatomy. Because of this, they had a funny run. It makes you laugh even at times you should really be serious.3. Giant saber-tooth tigers were herbivorous those days.4. Some tribesmen were capable of speaking in other languages in addition to their native English.5. There were high-precision razors those days; at least the main character used them to keep his beard precisely-maintained consistently, throughout the time span of the movie.6. The climate and weather changes are so rapid that they happen in a moment of switching between different cameras in the same scene.7. The psyche, interactions, behavior, dialogs and events of the people who lived 10000 years BC are very different from ours, that we (present day humans) find them some times irrational, some times very funny, some times very obvious and some times even totally ridiculous. No wonder some may even tend to see that it is nothing but the incompetence of the film makers. And don't say the plot is bad; it is just the nature of story telling 10000years-back-style.8. There had been deus ex machinas even the Greek Gods refused to accept the possibility of happening.9. Almost forgot (the last one): Mammoths are handy when building pyramids.Well, I was just kidding.Seriously, consider staying at home and doing some useful work, unless you plan to write the book ""1000 Things that can Go Wrong when Making a Movie"".","10,000 BC"

I just wanted to see a movie which would capture me for a short time and give me some enjoyment. I didn't care that they spoke English. the script was aimed at a 9 year old audience, it was appalling. The CGI was more than lacking, an attempt to show the mammoths and the saber tooth were more than comical, there seemed to be no "" consistent scale"". I do not want to get into a discussion on evolution or creationism. Overall I didn't know whether to go to sleep or walk out, I kept giving it the benefit of the doubt and hoped it would get better.

I don't remember much of how I felt about it then but when I rewatched it today I felt that more could've been done with the story line. I mean it seemed so cliche but still unique in a weird sort of way.,"10,000 BC"
425,ppvl76,Fantastic,10,13 March 2008,"Guys I'm not trying to sound cheese, but i'm sick and tired of the negative reviews for this great film. Every scene had a meaning in it, and i was definitely mesmerized by the entire story, and the way the characters are played. It is 10,000 BC, therefore it is not an evolution of characters. that's the beauty of it. the tribe is there, and the people hunt. the main point is that they stick to gather and hunt together. Now to convey this point does not require one to write a Kafkaesque type story.The entire story is about sacrifice, friendship, loyalty and love.Next, the simplicity of the life is shown so well: wait for the mammoths to come, have fun and fear in the hunt, and then get the bride. In our present culture of nth degree hectic life, this is very pleasantly disarmingly simple and sublime.Next, the traitor is considered a traitor. When one leaves a tribe, it is dishonorable. DLeh's dad left and that alienated others to DLeh. That is loyalty. Now tell me, in this culture of changing jobs at the drop of a hat, this concept is alien. But DLeh dad left because he wanted to save the tribe, and he does not want others to die off by following him in his quest for nowhere. That is sacrifice.The helpless before people with superior weapons is shown in a poignant manner. When the four legged beasts attack the tribe people get killed and the survivors cry, but faces and not forgotten (baku the child does not forget his mom's killer, there is vengeance and anger in his heart, but he is helpless being a child, and his good friend later in the movie, who was also abducted for slavery. His dad helps him find justice). Slavery. Yes the movie is about it. Its about powerful gods and their four legged beasts, who want to build monuments. Does it sound familiar?The movie is about powerful stimuli signals. There are thousands and thousands of slaves building the tower and a few overlords. But once the horn is given they all bow. Just think of it, no savior, no helper, in chains and fearing the god who could destroy them. Powerful, powerful portrayal. No one was able to stand up. Then Dleh for Love's sake want to pursue the four legged beasts. And others join. Why do they join?? Because of the thing called Loyalty. Does anyone know anything about it To go and pursue more powerful beings then ourselves and supporting a friend that is what the movie is about.Dleh does not want to keep the white spear is because he felt a Man's shame. A good man does not ride on false glory, he is Honorable and does not take false glory (though all the tribe believes that he single handedly killed the mammoth). Even if it means to lose Evolet. Foreign, foreign concept now and days.But he still loves her. So they trek out. They cross the lands. And the sabertooth, oh how great was that scene. The myth says no one can talk to a saber tooth (because it is the biggest beast). If one talks then he is the one to lead them (Given it is impossible and myth of the centuries, so it is just told as a folk lore). But now they see Dleh talk and Lo and Behold this legend spreads and everyone is strengthed to join and fight the godsDleh was not brave, but he was willing to die for his love. He was just like us weak, having misgivings about many things, want to turn back. But that's the beauty of the movie. It reminded me of Harry Potter.And they were great coincidences. It is as if Alternate history could be written. If Dleh did not help the saber tooth. The tribe would have killed him.If evolet did not leave the clues for Dleh in hope and nothing but hope. She would not have been hit so badly on her hands. And then the priest of the gods would not have measured the wounds and then there is no Hunter.It was all well woven, simply superb. What a great movie. I could go on and onperhaps I will later..","10,000 BC"
426,Ramas_imdb,"Very entertaining, worth seeing.",8,12 March 2008,"To be really honest, my only disappointment was that the plot was a bit compressed( the movie was not long enough), most likely a result of budget restrains and deadlines. On the other hand it flowed smoothly, uncomplicated, very imaginative and most of all entertaining. The cinematography was outstanding. The acting could've been better, then again, the times were simple and uncivilized. Even though there are some similarities found in scenes from other films(300, Apocalypto), the results are not, some of them being more positive than the originals:(spear hits target, no gory and graphic sacrifices, which is refreshing, for a change), as the movie focused on its main theme: A love story, not a historical saga. The special effects were average by today's standards, the mammoths looked realistic, the saber-toothed tiger did not get enough screen time to be appreciated and the big birds(chicks?)were a product of imaginary dreams. You will get your money's worth in entertainment value.","10,000 BC"

The movie never once claims to be factual or accurate or anything more than what it is (a STORY). I took the movie at face value, and I really liked it.It starts off a little bumpy in the first few minutes with a couple of really bad child actors, but once they're off the screen the whole story gets better. The music in the beginning of the movie is sparse, but when it kicks in later it also really shines. I'm not saying the movie doesn't have flaws, because it does.

432,DirkSkirsdag,What you see is what you get.,4,5 November 2019,"While scrolling through Netflix for something to watch, I stumbled upon this hidden gem. With most other titles on the Netflix platform, it plays a slight preview of the highlighted film. Though much like the wise words of an ancient oracle sent to warn me of what was in store, this film seemingly had no aforesaid preview. Like the foolish mortal I am, I watched this movie. I did not heed warning of the oracle. What you see is what you get, and what you get from this film, is nothing really. It's a shambled mess of historical inaccuracies, and plagued, much in the way 14th century Europe was. Though instead of a flesh eating disease, its poor writing and forgettable acting. The plot is paper thin and easily predictable by anyone with any sort of a brain. For a historical fiction film to suspend any disbelief it must remain somewhat within the lines of plausibility. The few things this film does right are immediately overshadowed by its glaring issues. Minecraft-esque biome changes, and fantastical meat eating velociraptor birds haunt this film like the ghost of b-movies past. HOWEVER! 10,000 BC is for the most part, a fun, yet flawed experience. If you're hanging with the boys, and want to make fun of some nonsense: 10,000 BC is the film for you... You maniac.
Just watch Troll 2 though.","10,000 BC"

434,dan-ragan-1,It is what it is.,6,1 July 2008,"I'm quite surprised at how many people are slamming this movie for historical inaccuracies, use of English, its similarity to several other films and a happy ending.I had no problem understanding this was not a historical documentary nor did any signs point to this film being the most original sensation of the year. When I went into the film, I expected a fictional Hollywood story with a bit of action and some entertaining special effects. Guess what I got? Yes, I got a fictional Hollywood story with a bit of action and some entertaining special effects. That's all it aspired to be, it works for the film and it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone thinking of sitting through it.On a side note, I hope the same people slamming this film for its historical inaccuracies, use of English and similarity to other works go slam Shakespeare next because these terms describe his most famous plays. As far as I am aware, they weren't speaking Shakespearean English in 13th century Verona, Italy. Anyone hear of, The Tragicall History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke? Published before Shakespeare was even alive, I wonder if he based ""Romeo and Juliet"" off it?Point is, 10,000 BC should be taken for what it is. It is two hours of Hollywood entertainment.

Without a lot: talent, good actors, suspense, drama. Actually I'm not completely honest. There was a part of the movie when the audience got tense. You could feel a sort of tension in the air. People on the edge of their seats. Something was going to happen on the screen... all of a sudden... the end of the movie, yes.

However, if you're just looking for a goof that you can watch with your kids (assuming you're into Interactive Parenting, and caution them that what they'll see is not really 100% accurate, and that REALLY GOOD ""FILMS"" CAN SOMETIMES BE BORING...) It isn't that bad. Better than a lot of T.V. is. Better-than-average straight-to-video. Not horrible. Not GREAT, but not horrible.To compare this to ""Apocalypto"" might be fair, and to criticize it accordingly might also be fair, but what sets this movie apart from that particular film is gore. The absence of excessive (or ""realistic,"" if you prefer) bloodshed gives a certain appeal in terms of the age-groups for whom it is appropriate.","10,000 BC"

Even if it did look a bit cheesy and wasn't true, it looked interesting just the same. To be honest, I think we'd have been better off waiting for it to be released on DVD and rent it. It was long, drawn out, and dragged on. Don't waste your money, or your time on seeing it at the theaters, or buying it on DVD.

We have over 1500 movies in our home collection and intend on adding this to the collection.

Well it is difficult with a film of this nature but lets see.... Roland, the director guy is a main-stream director (Independence Day) and was co-writer for this film. Roland stick to directing and leave the writing up to the professionals. While you can see why comparisons with Apocolypto have been made, in reality there is no comparison. Mel Gibson understands what it takes to make a movie with impact. Poor old Roland should do well in the Razz awards although with the Hilton sisters around he may not quite get the award for worst film.So to summarise.. see this film if you have nothing better to do for a couple of hours or you have a power black-out at home and need somewhere to get some heating or cooling (depending in which part of the world you come from). Better still save it for that time you have to spend a few days in bed and your mother gets out a whole bunch of $1 weekly dvds for you to watch. Spending any more money on the movie is a bad investment.","10,000 BC"
445,rockypg,Disappointing,3,8 March 2008,"I have just got back from watching this movie. I expected at least reasonable entertainment from this movie based on the excellent looking posters and the intriguing trailer. I must say, I came back disappointed.The movie starts out really slow. Even though it kind of picks up the pace towards the middle, it falters by the end again.There is way too much emphasis on shamanism, foretelling of future events, and other paranormal activity going on to be taken seriously. The acting is spotty, the costumes and make-up are weird, the graphics are passable and the presentation of historical facts throughly distorted.I'd like my money back now please :)","10,000 BC"

447,aliatym,why do critics...,9,9 March 2008,"why do critics criticize on the most idiotic of things. CGI is only really seen in two things, the mammoths and the saber tooth tiger, and I think a great job was done on them. They speak in English because we don't want to hear them grunting in an unknown language the whole time and just read subtitles when we could be looking at the beautiful and great actress Camilla Belle speak. seriously stop flaming this movie it was so good. I honestly feel that this is on my top 10. the love story was deep and anyone with even little education could see that. the action/adventure was great and there was also some comic relief. it had a bit of every genre and I was in love with the characters. great acting, and for those who say the script was bad, etc. well what do you expect from people in the mesolian era. they weren't gonna speak formally, and their regional slang just enhanced their character. although the ending was a bit weird, it was good. yes the movie is historically incorrect, what did u want a discovery channel documentary? seriously all the critics out there, if u wanna talk bad about this movie bring some valid points to the table.","10,000 BC"
448,maxmessling,Could have developed the plot a bit more,7,11 March 2008,"I knew that the movie had a very simple plot before going to see it. I had read a critic a week before. I knew that the movie relied a lot on computer generated effects. I had also seen the trailer many times and I was going to see it anyway.I felt that whoever was behind the construction of the pyramids had to have some source of power and should impose fear. That character, although playing a major in the movie, is poorly developed and has barely any screen time. We don't get to know that character or the source of his power. The trailer said that the main character would alter the course of history or save humanity. I did not feel that way. We do not see anytime in the movie that the humanity is about to be doomed by the tyrant that rules Egypt. It ends up being a very local storyline with no global or dramatic historic proportions. It feels that the story is more about the main character's tribe and its survival than the tyranny in Egypt.I was expecting a little more fantastic or out of the ordinary from the director who delivered the Star Gate and Independence Day. The ruler of Egypt is nowhere near Ra and nowhere as threatening for humanity as Ra was. Sadly, had this movie been about the revolt of the slaves that is mentioned in Star Gate and how D'Leh, the main character in 10,000 BC, lead that revolt, that would have been great. In the movie, we learn that the ruler of Egypt comes from Atlantis. Emerich missed a big opportunity to make something big about the movie. Had he just developed that part more instead of just mentioning it once, that would have been great.","10,000 BC"
449,Jeff_Hsieh,People expected too much,8,12 July 2008,"When watching this movie (or any movie for that matter), people need to suspend their beliefs of the real world and let their imagination free. I know it sounds corny but it's true.10,000 BC was a very entertaining movie with good special effects. Sure, the story was very typical, chasing love, sacrifice, and the coming together of people for a common cause. It was good nonetheless.And as for the historical settings, If you want accuracy, watch National Geographic. Do not watch this movie and then complain about accuracy. The movie is called 10,000 BC and well all know the Pyramids date back only to 2,600 BC.I feel like too many people were expecting a movie that depicted life in 10,000 BC where cavemen would mumble gibberish, wander around, draw on caves, and kill a mammoth once a year. Now THAT movie would've been terrible.This movie is what I expected out of it. 8/10","10,000 BC"
450,robert-simms,A Let Down,6,17 March 2008,"Though visually I enjoyed the film, it was ultimately a let down. Being in a digital world, I felt like the movie lived up to its expectations in terms of special effects. Everything looked good, but the story was awful. The acting was bad, and the dialog was very cheesy and unbelievable. This is a movie for kids under the age of 13. I took my little brother with me to see it and he rated it a 7 out of 10. He's 13. Though some aspects being original, it took on a lot of qualities that Mel Gibson's Apocalypto had, only Gibson's movie was a lot more realistic. This movie is a fantasy. I never felt sorry for any of the characters or ever rooted them on. Only thing I liked about the characters was Evelette's eyes and good looks. Overall this movie is a 6 out of 10. Very weak. Although it is now at the top of the box office, it will very soon be forgotten about.","10,000 BC"
451,qckddrs,Beware of Expectations.,9,9 March 2008,"The only thing I knew about the movie before seeing it was the poster, so I really didn't know what I was getting into. From what I read subsequently, I think that's the best way to see this film: otherwise, you will be too distracted by the story not fitting into a neat category, and not enjoy it.It's not my job to tell you whether you will like it or not; that's for you to find out. I can give a few pointers, mostly to dispel expectations.No, the movie is not about animals, or epic action scenes; in that sense it's about humanity. The lead character isn't the consummate epic hero, and has human weaknesses and human faults. The characters generally follow that line: relatively simple, relatively common, exceptionally human. In a way, it shows that as a species we haven't gone all that far in the last 10,000 years.The plot, as well, follows a classic -so as not to say ""simple""- theme: a young man's search for purpose in his life. But it doesn't follow the clichéd ""trials"" that the classic epic hero is supposed go through, which to me makes it more realistic. Of course that was ruined in the end, but it was nice while it lasted. Human lives are fairly straight-forward; we don't have a John Williams theme to our triumphs, our romantic moments are not punctuated with eloquent discourse, and our epiphanies aren't grandiose revelations. Unfortunately, the movie couldn't completely get away from the cliché, and ended up being an awkward bridge between a very human story, an epic battle and an exploration of life before civilization. A lot of people might say that's bad.Too me, that awkwardness combined with the feeling at the end that it's potential wasn't fully realized, was what made me really like the movie. It was, ultimately, very entertaining, almost in a fairytale way. Maybe it's me just being nostalgic, but that so many years after I'd lost my childhood innocence, a movie could call that feeling back in a very mature setting is definitely worth my approval. Of course no Oscar was ever awarded on that basis, but I think there's more to movies than little statuettes.On the other hand, maybe my expectations were just low.","10,000 BC"

If u don't sleep half way through, the other half will torment you in every way possible. The acting is pathetic except for the pretty female lead who adds a little to the movie with her presence. The special effects for which i went to the movie in the first place were pathetic, action sequences did not have any punch except leaving u with that continuous feeling of punching yourself again and again for spending time n money on this movie. Half the people were laughing and giggling about the (little) twists and (little) turns in the movie which were bollywood style with all those predictions making holy people and people coming back to life. There was no emotion that you would feel for the characters even if they die, you are just left with the feeling why am i here in the first place. i know i have been very harsh on this movie but there was a lot that could have been done in this movie but it was simply a WANNABE kind of a movie..Worst film in its genre that i saw until now !! rest is up to you, if u like taking chances this might change the way you think...","10,000 BC"

It had many historical inconsistencies but I forgave them just so I could focus on the intensity of the story. I was reluctant to see it because all the professional film critics on IMDb said it was horrible. I don't care for the opinion of anybody else because I like to sink my teeth in as deep as I can. I found it to be very interesting and it had its moments which triggered a deep idea of what 10,000 b.c. could have been like. Aside from perfect canines, the dread locked humans resembling homeless people from 4th avenue gave me a sense of commitment among the masses to overthrow a false god. I really thought it could've been much better but unlike the IMDb professionals, I won't hold this to be an award worthy attempt.

True it lacked meat but i like fantasy and even if its not """"historially accurate"""" like some movies, personally i feel it still rocked. I loved everything about this movie from the characters to the action. Plus if your going for Historical at least there's dreadlocks right.There are way worse movies out there and if you get the chance you should watch this one.

455,ryfisher88,"I tried to like it, I really did....",2,22 May 2008,"I borrowed a copy of this off a friend planning to make it a lazy late night movie. As always I found myself reading the reviews which were overwhelmingly negative, I was however determined to ENJOY the film and take it for what I thought it was worth.If I had paid money to see this in theaters I would have taken a cardboard cutout of Camilla Belle home as compensation. First and foremost the historic elements tend to lean to fantasy as does the setting. Due to the numerous historic errors and the benefit of a doubt I'll give the average viewer for not giving a damn I'll leave most of it out.Our intrepid hero and his band of anonymous and yet to be introduced supporting cast, who show as much support as a training bra on Pamela Anderson, traverse the Alps, Jungle and Desert in a matter of seemingly days. The CGI work in this department does not at all reflect the massive budget for this movie.The main cast I was looking forward to as they were fresh faces in a seemingly huge Hollywood project. I now understand why their faces were never seen on our screens before, the acting is shallow and there seems to be a hollow effort all round from the cast.Finally the worst part about the movie is the story. Expect recycled clichés from the word go right to the cringe worthy end, I got the feeling throughout the movie I had seen what I was watching before. There was no new element to this film and evoked no emotion except joy when it was over. I wont spoil too much but the story as a whole is not engaging.The movie has profited $157,900,000. Write a letter to Roland Emmerich and suggest it be given to a good cause because after this I doubt he should be allowed to make another movie.","10,000 BC"

I'm no historian or movie director, so if there were some flaws there, maybe I didn't notice them.But I've seen tons of movies (good and bad) and this was definitely one of the good ones.

For starters, the history of it is soooo wrong. I mean, they come out of the mountains and into ancient China, then they go from China into Africa and then they go from the desert and see pyramids. I mean, how did they get from China to Africa so quickly, and pyramids weren't built back then. Another thing, the actual photography of this film is sooooo wrong. The scene when they're around the camp fire in the darkness, you can easily tell they had the camera on the wrong shutter speed because its all grainy. I mean, a guy who did Independence Day (which was awesome) should know how to film a movie properly. It was so wrong. Even the story has something missing. The whole movie was a total flop and I don't recommend anyone to go see it. It's a waste of perfectly good money.","10,000 BC"

It had a good premise and I would like to see someone else take a shot at it.I don't mean to be so sore on the lack of historical context but it seems that if you are going to have a title 10000 bc then you should follow reasonably close to history.It looked like there was some attempt to explain why hunters and gatherers became food gatherers. But it failed to draw any serious conclusions at all.Also I had a hard time following any geographical context. Apparently, the hunters migrated from mountains to some kind of swamp jungle, and across desert all on foot in a time frame that didn't look like more than a few months.The only thing I liked was the Mammoths. Would have liked to see the Mammoths stomp on a few more people. That may not have been historically accurate either but it least it would have been fun.

I don't know who wrote it but line after line was cheesy and while watching this there were definite minutes where laughing was in order. On the other hand though, both Steven Strait and Camilla Belle were really good considering what they had to portray, they both played their parts well and got the point across.

461,scerwup,Made me want to claw my eyes out.,1,9 March 2008,"I'm not going to try and be articulate about this at all. Let me just state what I witnessed and be done with this movie forever. It's called 10,000 B.C. The pyramids that the ""Egyptians"" were building in the end, weren't even started until 3000-2500 B.C. So, they're about 7000 years early in this movie. They had metal swords, knives, and shackles. Unfortunately, metalworking didn't really come around until around 6000 B.C. And then it was only copper, which is not strong enough for swords, knives, or shackles. The Bronze age didn't begin until around 2700 B.C. So, yet again the movie is about 7000 years too early with that. 12,000 years ago, there was no English language when they were hunting with bone spears and stone axes and hand tools, so, for the people to speak perfect English is weird, but acceptable to allow people to understand what they are saying, however, when halfway through the movie, the original tribe proclaims English as their own language, I was absolutely amazed. I'm not one to analyze a movie like this, I'm usually the one that's telling my friend to ignore the inconsistencies because it's, ""Just a movie"". But, I just couldn't let this one go. Oh, also the story sucks, the characters invoke no emotion, and the plot is horrible. My friend and I went to see it, and then we went straight to a manager and demanded our money back, which we got back. This movie was horrible, PLEASE DO NOT spend ANY money on this movie.

There also similar scenes like the main character's girl gets fatality wounded, dies and is resurrected. And the same Ending. Kinda feels like a fruit cake hand-me-down. Even though its pure sci-fi, Stargate is more believable than this movie.

The mammoths, the savage, beaked jungle beasts and the giant saber tooth tiger all make splendid appearances. The spectacular landscapes of desert, mountain, river and jungle also deliver the images we are expecting. It's the humans who let us down.

468,Vladu11,"Prehistorical Inaccuracy, monumental catastrophe",1,25 March 2008,"1. From what i've seen in the trailers i somehow expected this movie to lack the historical accuracy of the movies it wanted to resemble. What i didn't expect is the sheer degree of it! There is no proof of civilization existing at that time, let alone the construction of colossal monuments. I also think that the size of the mammoths is exaggerated (among other things), but that's just me. The Sabretooth and the Terror Bird did live at the same time in South America, but not around people from D'Leh's tribe (which were clearly European - Cro Magnon) or the later encountered Africans. It's also impossible to come across some snowy mountains, a lush jungle and a vast desert in just a couple of days walk. They practically took 3 late prehistoric animals, 3 continents, and 3 types of people and packed them altogether in an area of 300 square miles for a Prehistoric ZOO!!2. I watched this movie because it was probably never meant to be accurate and i forced myself to believe it's gonna be at least entertaining. Bad acting and a pointless story-line, full of clichés could still provide entertainment... If only were original:* Bad men take prisoners from peaceful village of hunters to take to Pyramid = Bad men take prisoners (wich were also hunters) to sacrifice on... guess what - pyramid! (Apocalypto)* Stuck in deep cave, drowning with rain water = same thing (Apocalypto)* Man who talks to giant pussycat = Man who brings the Jaguar (Apocalypto)* D'Leh uniting early tribes to fight of suppressors = Wallace uniting tribes of Scotland to fight of the English (Braveheart)* D'Leh - spear-throw - ""Tutankhamun"" = Leonidas - spear-throw - Xerses (300) (heck, even the part when someone else speaks for the god king is copied).* And more... chase trough tall grass and on trees(Apocalypto), leader speaks to folk before final battle (Braveheart), telling them to fight ""AS ONE"" (Gladiator).Still they all could've been mixed to a purpose. But the story is absolutely pointless. They exchanged 3 extreme climates in just 3 days, in a time when ""chicken"" ate man, had a nice cit-chat with a Sabretooth, crossed a desert in stead of just following a river (for the sheer adventure of it), freed some slaves who were already capable of rebellion (but din't because they enjoyed being whipped - kinky bastards), and then destroyed the world's first empire (delaying the appearance of civilization by 6000 thousand years) just because the stole the village ""superstar"". Now the tribes of men will again be FREE, NAKED, and STARVING. Truly a land marking event in man's history!!This movie is a complete ripoff from the movies it wanted to match!!!!""The story of an orphan who became a hunter, the hunter who became a leader, the leader who destroyed man's first hope of civilization...

Don't read this comment and go off expecting a movie about aliens; all I'm saying is that it should be treated as a fantasy story rather than a documentary.It was predictable and clichéd in parts, but in a way that makes it refreshingly simple and easy to enjoy the amazing CG (which, despite what has been said, is worthy of Jurassic Park and Discovery Channel specials) along with the sweet love story and the innocence of the characters.The movie is, as I've mentioned before, a lot like Lord of the Rings with the theme of ""adorable naive character goes out into the big scary world and becomes a hero,"" except much shorter and easier to watch.

I believe that this movie did have some flaws, and could have had more with the sabertooth, but, all in all, a great movie. I believe that all of the nerds that left the bad comments, about this movie, should stick to Star Wars, and the History Channel. A lot of people are complaining about the weak dialect in the movie when the characters are supposed to primitive. The reason that they're are speaking in English is so that you wouldn't have to read the subtitles at the bottom constantly when there may be action happening. Who wants to read when the point of going to a movie is to enjoy themselves instead of concentrating and having to read constantly. A must buy when it comes out on DVD.","10,000 BC"
474,milesnsmiles2003,Loved it,10,7 March 2008,"Shot in the mountains of New Zealand and the deserts of Namibia, the cinematography and scenery are magnificent. Some here have complained about a weak story, yet the story is straight out of the classic western but set back in time: good vs evil where good triumphs in the end. I found the story of many diverse tribes of people banding together to fight against the bad guys to be quite uplifting. The movie is a fun ride with spectacular visual effects, though I did have a little trouble with all the moving aerial ""helicopter shots"" in a movie set in 10,000 B. C. but nonetheless they're fun to watch. It's not too violent, so it should be fine for older kids. There is no spraying gore and blood spattering everywhere like you see in some movies that contain fight sequences. It's well worth the trip.","10,000 BC"

So, I thought it would be fairly difficult to be disappointed. I was wrong. during the movie, lots of people laughed on the scenes which were supposed to be serious. It was a comedy. There are two good things in this movie. 1. a gorgeous heroine. (Wow, I could not believe she is a real human!) 2. wonderful visual. (just like any other movies today) That's it that's all The ending was over the top. I would give more stars to this movie if she remained as the departed. By the way, I'm really wondering about the taste of mammoth meat. I just have to create at least 10 lines in order to post my comment.

The trailer had juuuust enough mystery (more like, I WANT TO SEE A SABER-TOOTH EAT A DUDE) to catch my interest. Come to find out there's a lame love story, and the saber-tooth ended up being a pretty upstanding citizen. Isn't this prehistoria? Shouldn't it be hard to survive? They made a trek across the Sahara look like a mosey through my backyard. On the upside, I did get to hear a giant predatory bird rip a man to pieces. Unfortunately though, giant birds of that nature went extinct somewhere in the ballpark of 1,000,000 years ago. Too bad. My advice, make a crappy sequel and this time just have prehistoric animals kill everyone. At least there will be some karmic justice.","10,000 BC"

Did anyone know that Mel Gibson had a part in this movie and its the same damn script as Apocalypto...getting a little more awesome now. Im glad that Jesus Christ was cruising around Africa in 10,000 B.C. with a sporty hair doo,able to kill a false profit, be the only person to speak English, and all the while able to save these people from Egyptians (or at least their obviously depicted that way). This was a terrible movie, I would never let anyone with a mailable mind see this and mistake any of it for fact. But thats whats going to happen Im sure","10,000 BC"
480,moviereviews-4,"10,000 B.C. - Error on Era",4,10 March 2008,"Watching 10,000 B.C. reminds me of Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"". There's really nothing new on the movie's storyline. D'Leh was a mammoth hunter trying to rescue the love of his life, Evolet, who was taken away by the bad guys from other civilization. The ""I-am-your-hero-and-I-will-rescue-you"" plot is so overused anyone who will watch this film will already have an idea it will have a happy ending.It seems the guys who made this film weren't so sure what to tell about the movie. Is this all about the mammoths or about the love story? Also, I can't help myself figure it out if human civilization matched the mammoth era? I mean hey, those guys are already building pyramids! The plot is weak and it's so obvious writers Roland Emmerich and Harald Kloser wanted to make a story out of something prehistoric.The movie could have been more realistic if at the ending Evolet died. I just don't get it Evolet became alive again because their tribe's shaman ""Old Mother"" sacrificed her life in order for Evolet to have a second life. The mysticism is not convincing at all.The cast was a pretty good selection but unfortunately, not all delivered. Steven Strait (D'Leh) still looked weak where he should have a vengeful character. Camilla Belle (Evolet) has that captivating pair of eyes and ever sweet smile but her acting in general seemed not genuine. On the other hand, Affif Ben Badra (Warlord), Marco Khan (One-Eye) and Joel Virgel (Nakudu) have short roles but delivered a superb, realistic acting.Perhaps the only best thing 10,000 B.C. has to boast is the great CGI special effects. I'm impressed in the scene where a herd of mammoths run while the hunters were chasing them. The saber-toothed tiger wasn't impressive enough though since it looked artificial and its body movement not genuine.10,000 B.C. offers us another look at the prehistoric times. It also sends a message of hope, friendship, love and courage. But we've all seen these typical stories before that's why this one doesn't generate any excitement or thrill at all. Better wait for the DVD instead as this movie is not as good as the trailer shows.Rating: 4/10 stars for 10,000 B.C..","10,000 BC"
481,squeejthmrox,"Meh....it was okay. Action filled, boring at times.",4,12 March 2008,"This movie was not completely atrocious. Yes the characters lacked depth, yes none of it made a lot of sense, but the CGIs were pretty good, especially the tiger and the mammoths. Those boats were okay as well. Landscapes were well done, and overall the visuals were satisfactory.I had a problem with the fact that Evolet did not die. She was dead, she was on the ground, sad ironic ending. All of the sudden, the old lady who was DAYS away from them back in the camp gave up her soul and Evolet came back to life. Cute. Very cute. I would have rather she just lived, not come back to life. It made it sadly funny that this guy has spent the last 2 hours of your time tracking this girl across the desert and the mountains and that random tropical forest and now she dies! Really a letdown. Don't get me wrong, i like happy endings, but that was just too much. The magical Indian voodoo thing was too random to fit the story. Random dinosaur chicken things kind of sucked, as did the random tropical forest right after they got out of SNOW. Random desert after that.....confusing.The story was so weird though. I had trouble following what was going on and thus was so confused by the end, i just stopped thinking and watched the mindless violence. That made me happy.Overall, see this movie if you're the kind of person who loves it when ""true love"" prevails even over death, and like the random violence. If you like the villains, or just cant stand all this sappy romance, skip this one. Its a romance and a sci fi, on account of, once again, those stupid dino-chickens.","10,000 BC"
482,ballernumbat,My eyes were drenched in tears... because I wasted my money,5,13 March 2008,"*THIS HAS SPOILERS*The effects were GREAT. The acting was bad and there were numerous cheesy moments. Like Ken Canada said, it seemed to try and rip off many things from Gladiator and other great movies. I did not like this movie one bit. The plot at some point made no sense and some scenes were just pathetic. When the beast is trapped the women says she is most fearful because he has to fight the beast. Well... he frees the beast they have a ten second make out and the beast leaves. NO fight. Oh and you ever get that feeling when the actor does something so cheesy it makes you feel embarrassed? well i felt that numerous times my friends. One time is when he tells the big warrior that he looks younger than he is and his comrades smile like it's funny, I almost just got up and left. I mean this movie was a roller-coaster, sometimes I was saying Wow! and then sometimes I was saying wooooooooooooooooow that's so stupid. Anyways it's a film you should see if you enjoy good effects and creatures and such. What would have made this movie a greater movie is if they did not speak English at all and rather subtitles for each and more fighting scenes. this would have made the movie more intense and realistic and it also would have drawn the audience in more. By the way, did you notice how fast they conquered those pyramids? and then the resolution when the old lady who the directors give us no bond to sacrifices herself to save the girl?what a weak conflict. Maybe if we were given a bond with the old lady at least it would have some affect but wow that ending was so bad. So, if you like great effects go see this film, if you like acting and a movie where you actually feel intense and into it... don't waste you're time on this prehistoric crap. Oh but i would like to thank 10000B.C for encouraging me to get an account on IMDb so i can express my anger with my fellow people.","10,000 BC"
483,bsquared04,Disappointment at its finest.,1,13 March 2008,"Several of my friends saw this movie before myself. They brought back with them from the theaters broken hearts and words of warning, but still i was drawn to this movie. I was expecting an exciting, adrenaline pounding epic and I thought all the critics were rating it poorly simply because it wasn't Oscar worthy stuff and the fact that they are all old, depressing people that live to run entertainment down. However upon seeing it i realized that not only was it not a deep or life altering film, but it wasn't even good entertaining schlock. It was BORING and even the action scenes seemed empty. Furthermore the longer it went on, the more i realized how inaccurate it was. Horses wern't domesticated until at the very latest 4,500 B.C, yet there being ridden into battle. Then you have guys chains with locks, warriors using metal weapons in the stone age, and giant feats of archiecture 1000 years before the first stone structures were built at Jericho. Listen, if your educated in history, DON'T SEE IT! If you want a wonderfully built storyline and powerful acting, DON'T SEE IT If you want 2 hours of relative entertainment to pass time you'd be watching Seinfeld reruns, still please DON'T SEE IT. We can't give the studios motives to pump out more garbage.","10,000 BC"

The story outline is weak (or is it called ""tried & tested""?), the characters are superficial and the performance of the actors is not helping - I stopped counting the number of different accents the ""hero"" used in the duration of the movie. Even though these factors are harmful to any movie the worst still was still to come: I do not mind making small adjustments to the historical background of a movie in order to make it better (or sometimes merely work), but this film really takes the prize! The numbers of modifications made in the movie is astonishing. I'm not sure but I think the background check for the movie was made by a 10-year old - if it was made at all...It is as if the director didn't know what kind of movie he was trying to make, which is a shame. I would only recommend it to my worst enemy - that'll teach him!","10,000 BC"

Finally, I decided to go see the movie anyway and was impressed. 10,000 BC by no means was one of the greatest movies that I have seen but it does not deserve the negative treatment that it is presently receiving. I think the problem with a movie of this nature is that the public goes to see it thinking that they are about to see a film that will line up with greats like Braveheart, Gladiator, Troy and so on. Instead of simply trying to enjoy this film for what it is...a decent movie...the public had been quite disappointed. I would recommend to anyone that enjoyed the films that I listed above to go see this movie. Usually I agree with the negative and positive remarks made by the critics. But in the case of 10,000 BC, moviegoers and critics need to be open-minded and not put a film up on a pedestal before they have seen it!","10,000 BC"
486,icanfly-1,A little bit more would have done it for 10000 BC,4,15 March 2008,"First of all, let me start off by telling you the good aspects of this movie. Throughout the whole movie, the use of CGI is absolutely overwhelming, and everything looks very realistic. The plot could be called, ""mediocre"", but if you were to sit down and have a think, it does make sense. Both, the use of CGI and the good plot combined could make a brilliant movie, correct? But no, 10000 BC misses something, it misses the Hollywood sense, the ""edge of your seat"" feeling, and this is all down to the suspense, and the tension build up. During the movie, there is no suspense, and no tension, there is no drama, and absolutely no character recognition. This makes us not want to know what happens, it does not attract attention to the movie, its just like watching a series of moving pictures, with no sense of what is happening. Also, the movie tries to be too much like other ""BC"" movies, and it is not unique, a lot of the CGI and plot has been ripped off other movies, and we are not amazed when events take place in the movie, because we get a feeling of, ""oh no, not this again"". After half the movie has passed, the only thing on our minds is, ""when will this finish?"" So, in all, if you are going to watch a movie to ""pass-the-time"", or if enjoy special effects, I recommend this movie to you. But if you like watching movies for the plot, the drama, suspense, thriller, and tension, this movie will not please you at all.","10,000 BC"

And the mammoths - weren't they supposed to belong to the ice age, and ice age only? What are they doing dragging huge blocks in the middle of a desert?

The plot was slow, there were too many inaccuracies to count, and there were far too few action sequences.I may not have been so disappointed if it hadn't been hyped so much.The only reason I'm not giving it a 1 rating is because the action sequences that WERE included were pretty good. Basically, my $9.75 ticket cost bought me two hours of waiting endlessly for this movie to be put out of its misery. The general consensus of people leaving the theater at the same time as me was about the same. I might've been all right with watching this as a rental; I certainly wouldn't have felt as ripped off if I had only invested $2.99.","10,000 BC"

And the cherry on top of this terrible-movie-sundae is the fact that is a slap in the face to both history and known geography.If you have any inclination whatsoever to see this movie please do yourself a favor sit down and watch-Apocalypto, 300, and Clan of the Cavebear while forcibly hitting yourself in the forehead with a hammer.

490,fishscapes1,Enjoyed it very much.,7,16 March 2008,"Despite bashing from the critics, I thought the movie was very enjoyable. Moviegoers often disagree with critics anyway. The special effects were outstanding. The scenery and sets were excellent. I think it's silly for the critic on the IMDb website to complain that the characters spoke perfect English. There is something called ""suspension of disbelief,"" in which you pretend they are not actually speaking English. This saves the movie viewer the aggravation of having to read subtitles through the entire film. Also, considering that language skills and communication were probably not as highly developed 12,000 years ago, the critic's complaint that the dialogue was weak may not have too much merit, either. Like someone else said, if you want accuracy, or actually the best guess at accuracy, watch the History Channel.

In between you can see his valiant fights with a woolly mammoth, saber tooth tiger etc etc. His mentor gets killed in between giving our hero resolve and valour ... you can guess the rest of it.Please don't watch the movie, even if it is shown in the telly.","10,000 BC"

This movie was not just filled with clichés, it was filled with direct RIP-OFFS: Remember when you were young and you were given a creative writing assignment, and you filled the story with stuff you thought was cool in movies? Yeah, its like that.The final scene where the hero is given a proposition, thinks about it, pretends to agree, then throws his spear at the leader... 300?? anyone anyone?The plot where slavers capture an indigenous tribe and the hero fights them. Apocalypto? anyone?I'm sure there's many more rip-offs, but they escape me at the moment. Suffice to say, I watched Apocalypto afterwards and my faith in movies was restored. (I watched it because I heard 10,000BC was trying to copy off of it, and I knew there was no way in hell there could be a worse pre-historic movie out there.)There are some movie-makers who have no talent except a feel for the market, and they try to exploit that to make a profit. Then there are movie-makers who can justly be called artists.Guess which one Emmerich is...PS I saw this crappy movie, knowing it would be crap, for the same reason I saw Step-up 2. That I was expecting it to have some great element to it (Step up 2 had some amazing dance choreography) However, 10000BC has no amazing element to it.

496,sansenome,Find something better to do,1,26 March 2008,"10,000 BC has me writing my first post to IMDb. I saw the film today free of charge as a supervisor for a spring break field trip. With me were 2 middle school boys, 3 elementary school boys, 1 high school girl, and two other supervisors. The elementary kids enjoyed the movie; no one else did. I don't think the target audience for this film was elementary aged children, but for the most part they will be the only ones impressed and entertained by it. I saw Independence Day twice, and via school supervisory duties saw The Day After Tomorrow four times. I enjoyed both of these films. They entertained. I saw the posters and teaser clips for 10,000 BC and hoped that it be similarly entertaining in that very mindless sort of way. Nope. This movie was a waste of time. It was a cardboard sandwich made of cardboard between two slices of cardboard. I have read that one redeeming quality for this film was the stunning scenery and cinema photography. Actually, even this was primarily generic (mountains, desert) or fake (jungle, pyramids). Far better movies that came to mind while sitting through 10,000,000,000,000 BC are: 1)Lawrence of Arabia (truly stunning desert cinema photography) 2)Conan the Barbarian (better dialog even from Arnold) 3)Beast Master (what 10,000 BC was desperately trying to be, but Beast Master is still so much better because it's actually fun). Skip 10,000 BC. There are plenty of other mindlessly entertaining movies out there that are worth your time and money. Soren","10,000 BC"

However if you go in without that expectation, you may have a better chance of seeing 10,000 BC for what it truly is: an archetypal story of the reluctant hero going to save his damsel in distress. This film is so full of archetypes (wise old woman, young stowaway, man behind the curtain, wise father figure etc.) that it should have been sold as a kids movie.Other than this, there are some interesting concepts on different cultures & wildlife & some cool looking dreadlocks. So if you like the simplicity of children's stories with a few historical controversies for the adults to ponder over, you'll probably like this film.","10,000 BC"
498,alar-9,I liked it,7,28 March 2008,"If you search for historical accuracy, you never cant get it if the date is 10 000 BC. Everything we know about that time is learned through skeleton remains.The film follows Graham Hancocks theories about pyramid builders as atlanteans or something like that. Even the Sphinx is shown as Hancock's theories: fully as a Lion. (Hancock refers, that the head of the Sphinx is too small and there is a possibility that it was a lion at first and later remade by the pharaohs.Its also a fact that at that time there where two species of humans: Neanderthals and homo sapiens. Probably this movie speaks about homo sapiens I thinks because of their look. ;) And about English speaking. Helloo people we have lots of movies about ancient Egypt, Greek and Rome where everyone speaks English.So this movie was not one of my all time favorites but i liked its concept. Sure the story could be a little more complex but I never thought during the film ""When its gonna end"" So it definitely isn't any time and money wasting experience, but everyone else has its right to his/hers opinion.","10,000 BC"

After this they end up somehow in the desert in Africa where they try to chase some boats up the Nile, where instead of following the river they went across the desert and nearly died, when arriving at the pyramids they found they were built by mammoths (yes big woolly mammoths) what a load of old crap!","10,000 BC"
501,julia-fracker,Something for Everyone - I really enjoyed it!,8,9 April 2008,"OK, I am posting a review here because of the horrible reviews of this movie. First, allow me to establish that I am an avid movie goer and generally agree with user reviews. In this case, however, I completely disagree. I very much enjoyed this movie.Perhaps it is because I went to the movie without any expectations. I wanted to see a movie and it was the only thing that was remotely interesting. I had no idea who was in it or what it would be about. I was a little apprehensive to go see it because I knew they spoke English and not something ancient, such as from Clan of the Cave Bear. To tell the truth, once I got into the movie, it did not bother me.Yeah, so it was not all action. Perhaps there should have been more plot or character development - but I didn't notice until I read the other reviews here. I loved the fact that D'leh risked everything for the woman he loves, it touches the romantic in me. I love that every group of people he met had a prophesy about him or Evalette - it touched the fantasy/sci-fi lover in me. I loved the action (the hunt, the bird scene, the fights with the the baddies and the end battle) it touched the action movie lover in me.Honestly, IMHO, this movie has it all. Romance, action, mystery, suspense, intrigue and a beautiful setting. I was in love from the opening credits and captivated throughout the film.So, please don't hate me for enjoying this film. Perhaps it was because I went in without expectations. I had no assumptions of what it would be like and therefore there was nothing in me to be disappointed.I am very happy that I saw this movie, it was worth my money.","10,000 BC"

In other words, this movie is completely and utterly ridiculous. Its story is laughable, its dialogue: cringe worthy, and its acting is way the top. The effect is far more comedic than dramatic. I went with a friend and we spent the duration of the picture making jokes and pissing off the people sitting near us with our inappropriately timed laughing. Something can be said for the visual effects, but they are nothing more than what we've come to expect from a Roland Emmerich movie. If you really want to see a big-budget, action-packed, effects-laden Emmerich film than save yourself the eight bucks and go rent ""Independence Day"".","10,000 BC"
503,Patrick_Fortin,woot,6,10 April 2008,"the movie 10,000 BC is one of the most predictable movies that I have ever seen and the animation in my opinion was a bad imitation of 300. the ending of this movie really ended slow and this was one of the moments that that you new what was going to happen. This also is were the whole scene remake comes in from the end of 300 with the soring spear that reveals the vulnerability of the so called god. honestly I would never go and see this movie again but If you have never seen it and you have nothing better to do I would at least go and admire the cgi animation that was put in to it because the animals where the only thing that in my opinion was well done. basically it was a good movie to fill time up with but that is about it.","10,000 BC"

505,pjotrspaan,Unbelievably unrealistic...,1,14 April 2008,"First let me compliment you guys and gals on the hilarious comments on this crap movie. Whenever I'm feeling a bit down, visiting IMDb can always make me laugh again. This total rip-off is not only historically inaccurate. It would be completely unrealistic in any imaginable universe or fantasy world. The only reason I'd like to see it again is for the scene where the Egyptian priests are doing some astrology/mythology mumbo-jumbo and they conjure up a map on which I thought I recognized Spain and other parts of the Mediterranean and which the Romans would have been proud of. I'm in grave doubt now whether my sight was true in that moment in the theater, because my mind was in great chaos starting from the attack on the mountain village by the Arabian marauders. There is something positive about this kind of 'historical' movies. I already knew that corn (zea mays) originates from Latin America, but the other errors make me wonder about the real historical background. It seems you can learn from bad examples...","10,000 BC"
506,patzeine,pretty OK,5,21 April 2008,"The name is a bit misleading as it has nothing to do with 10,000 BC but is a typical slave uprising, boy meets girl boy loses girl boy chases girl, boy meets some strange people befriends strange animals, and becomes leader of a rebellion, boy rescues girl. It is a politically correct story you can take a 10 year old to see kind of movie. It was very Disney and not at all historical, no blood, no sex - just a bunch of people with really bad taste in clothes and funny customs set in a shallow and predictable storyline. But even with all that it is a pretty OK movie I would recommend you see it - but I am not buying the DVD when it comes out. This movie could have been better but it is OK for what it is.","10,000 BC"
507,brendan-244,I hope votes higher than 1 were for the mammoth.,1,1 May 2008,"That was the only plus for me with this movie. Utter rubbish - boring, predictable re-hash. Cliché after cliché after cliché. Why didn't someone look at this at some stage during the production process and admit that it was poor. They must have seen it - it is that obvious. The plot must have been written on a train journey home from work. No chance of a spoiler where this movie is concerned. What makes me laugh (no scrub that - cry) is that someone somewhere will have used the word epic to describe this movie. There are plenty of movies that I don't like but they do their job. They tell a story and appeal to some people. This can only leave people feeling cheated. Movies like this make me so angry when you think of all the good ideas out there that will never see the light of day. Sorry for ranting but I just had to register to get this off my chest.","10,000 BC"
508,jeremy191,Terrible!!,1,3 May 2008,"This movie is a waste of time and money. Costumes were terrible. Acting was extremely terrible,and the entire story plot was terrible. I mean the commercials made it seem as if the mammoths and the tiger was actually going to play a big role in this movie but they played only in on act and was completely pointless and made no sense what so ever in the movie!! This movie made everything so pointless. I went to see this movie expecting it to be exciting and with a great adventure. Instead I almost fall asleep in the movie theater when watching the first thirty minutes of it then it gets interesting in the middle. All of sudden it ends in a blink of an eye and all the characters go back to the way they started from the beginning of the movie. Yawn.......!!","10,000 BC"
509,yossiwahyo,disappointed,4,11 May 2008,"This is what you get if are believe in the trailer too much. I went to see this movie was because I want to know about history, about mammoth and saw the trailer of the movie, look's promising. but unfortunately this movie is not about mammoth, it's about a guy following the trail of his girlfriend kidnapper, and make friends along the way. If you want to movie with similar story, better watch apocalypto. Or if you want to see movie about mammoth, watch Ice age. More fun. I was hoping the 'tiger' will showed up in the battle, it will be more 'killing ' scene, or I hope the enemy it's not just a weirdo covering all his body with sheet and can do anything accept moving his long nails. well, so much with 10.000 BC, it's just forgettable. accept Camilla belle of course... :)","10,000 BC"
510,ruzzeltanawon,prehistoric period and mankinds evolution,8,26 May 2008,"The movie is great, the trailer is catchy. it actually shows how the mankind evolve from hunter to a farmer, and our abilities to observed our environment and tries to understand the things thats happening.it also showcase the history of mankind from the prehistoric period so its best to watch with the kids, but of course the violence part must be explain well by the parents and the guardians.at first you would compare it to some bible movies the part of exodus, Egypt, slavery, and a leader that will set them free. but all in all i like the plot and the CGI of the film its great movie and must see.also Steven Strait have done a good job here your could see his improvement from a bad boy super villain turn super hero in sky high, into a promising actor.","10,000 BC"
511,wilson2174,I loved it!,8,24 June 2008,"I don't understand why people are so negative. I really loved this movie. In fact, I wished it had been a tad bit longer. To me, the movie rushes by. I wanted to know more about all the characters and wished they would haved longer at each place. Most of the criticism comes from the fact that the movie is not based on fact. SO WHAT? It is a fantasy story. I guess these people would criticize THE WIZARD OF OZ because it isn't based on fact.First of all, the film is just beautiful especially the scenes in Egypt. The boat sailing down the nile was wonderful. The special effects were good. The story, although simple, was logical. I liked the Atlantis theme and I would have liked to see more of their backstory. Had a great, if not, predictable ending, but all in all, a great movie!","10,000 BC"
512,daniellehull39,"Just my thoughts of 10,000 BC",4,25 June 2008,"I thought this movie was OK. I do have to say that the preview for the movie did make it look a whole lot better than it actually was. I think there should of been more action. I believe the story line should of been more about stopping and conquering the people who kidnapped the Yagahi people, in which they kinda made it more of a love story and personally I thought that made it boring and kinda cliché. Steven Strait and Cliff Curtis were amazing hunters and ""warriors"" and they should of focused more on what they can do. Also, I think they should of interpreted the prehistoric animals as well, especially the saber tooth (spear tooth). I would of like to of seen more of a connection between the saber and D'Leh. That I think would of made it a little better. Overall, it was good but definitely could of been better. And again Steven Strait was awesome and should be in more movies.","10,000 BC"

I was wrong. The movies starts OK, but quickly goes down hill after that killing any expectation of an entertaining evening.Early in the movie the kids just left the room to go watch cartoons instead. We (my wife and I) were so utterly amazed at how bad the movie was we only watched the remainder of the movie to see how much worst it could really get. Call us suckers for pain...but this movie is like a nagging sore that hurts when you scratch it - but you scratch it anyway.","10,000 BC"
514,leannepoole,Great movie,8,28 June 2008,"I truly enjoyed this movie. It may not have been historically correct, but so what, let's see..... an ice age in New York wasn't exactly ""historical"" either. How many movies do we watch every day that have absolutely no historical relevance whatsoever? I thought his was very enjoyable if you just want to watch a movie. The scenery was great, the costumes were great. It was just generally an enjoyable movie. It was an epic movie in it's own way. Sometimes you just want to sit down and switch off and watch something that will keep your attention, without having to think about your history lessons from high school. I don't usually write these things, but this movie got such a slamming and i though it was really good. See it and make up your own mind.","10,000 BC"
515,ec_land259,It wasn't perfect but it was entertaining.,8,2 January 2009,"I would first like to mention that I thought the movie was not as bad as the ratings and comments make it out to be. There were some parts where they could have done better, but all in all it was interesting and entertaining. To my understanding, people do not go to the movies to see historical documentary, but this movie has been getting a lot of criticism for not being historically accurate. When people go to the movies they just want to be entertained and this movie did a good job of doing that. There are many movies out there such as Indiana Jones that have parts that are not historically accurate or parts that are ridiculously not real (aka when Indy doesn't die because he closes his eyes), but it gets good ratings because people think it is an entertaining movie/movies. 10000 BC was not meant to be completely historically accurate, it was just a movie with a fictitious plot.","10,000 BC"
516,wabplanalp,touching,9,1 July 2008,"I actually wouldn't call this an action movie because honestly this movie action wise completely sucked. Also it was really predictable. This sounds like a terrible movie obviously and the critics hated it. This movie made me think about what i would do in this position and all the people i would walk 1000 miles for. The determination of the main character completely blew me away. and he did this beside his friends who, like mine, would walk 1000 miles right next to him the entire time. and guys shut up about the historically accurateness, it never said it was. its a movie that goes in the fiction genre. It was a great movie and i recommend it to pretty much everyone i know. happy watching","10,000 BC"
517,simpson23,Blah,3,4 July 2008,"This movie was a movie worth your time if you were trapped in a car for 10 hours like I was. It was a below average movie with a very simple plot, no twists and some stupid events. Having Wooly Mammonths in the desert is just plain stupid. ALso traveling across what it seems like the entire Earth in a span of a few days is retarded. I think the writers thought that Pangea was a super continent on this Earth 10000 years ago. When the main character had a spear and was deciding on whether to accept the Egyptian gods offer or to take it was the most predictable scene in the world. Of course he would chuck the spear 200 yards away and hit the god in the heart. A rip off of 300 but in 300 it came unexpectedly, was more epic, and more surprisingly. This movie was a huge disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it to a dog.","10,000 BC"
518,johnpjoyceh,Great flick,10,5 July 2008,"This was hugely camp and hugely entertaining. As long as you don't take yourself too seriously, you can really get a laugh out of this movie. The special effects are really great and the costuming is truly entertaining. The take on geography is quite creative, and some scenes actually have some pretty interesting scenery. Mainly the good guys are good guys and the bad guys are bad--a nice black and white approach for today's world! It's fun to try to figure out how many ancient cultures are being glancingly represented in the various groups in the film and how many myths are alluded to. If you're looking for history or anthropology, try something else--but this was a total hoot! It was great fun.","10,000 BC"
519,queenmeranda,Great movie!!!!,10,6 July 2008,"I really loved the essence and feel of the movie. It felt authentic and yes it did mesh some things from different areas and such together but I feel that it was put together quite well. It is a huge task to make a movie that will hold attention for someone who doesn't care for history. I thought it was nicely done, even the fact about how it was thought the great pyramids were much older than they were tied in well with the plot. It made for an exciting movie to watch and I felt anxious during climatic moments. I was very much into it and wish more movies would have this same authentic feel to ancient times. As a history major, I would love to see more well done movies about prehistoric times. I also loved the blend of cultures as a world history concentration.","10,000 BC"
520,saltydawkins,Worse than Pathfinder,1,11 July 2008,"Until popping this piece of crap into my DVD player I thought Pathfinder was the worst movie I'd ever have to see. And the worst part is that almost everything, including the kid with the vaguely Hindu accent, would be mostly acceptable if they hadn't presented the time-frame (and one makes the assumption of the planet) right there in the title. Had it been presented as a fantasy, perhaps in some parallel universe, then I could completely excuse the 5,000 (+/- from the title) year swing in historical events and wildlife. I could forgive the language which, unfortunately is reminiscent of how American Indians were portrayed in the early westerns. I might even be able to accept the main character's relationship with the saber-toothed tiger.But as it stands, a story presented as 12,000 years prior to right now, none of that is either believable or acceptable. My dad was right. That crappy Ringo Starr movie was better than this.","10,000 BC"

No need to say more about that.Mammoth hunters lived in central Europe (nowadays Czech republic and small parts of Slovakia and Austria) between 30-20k BC and certainly were not black. Actors are well shaved: after weeks/months of traveling across half of the world all of them has the same haircut and same beards. Moreover, even the hunting style is artificial, mammoths were hunted totally different way.Stupid movie done badly. Beware.

522,macaroo388,Meh.,2,15 July 2008,"Unless you have...or are...a bored thirteen-year-old girl, don't waste your time. This film is full of two dimensional characters (you won't care what happens to them even if you're able to tell most of them apart), mildly entertaining CGI mammoths, anachronistic and misplaced Terror Birds which would have been extinct on an entirely different continent roughly a million years before the homogeneous savages in the movie were born, and one Smilodon who was apparently the ancestor of Androcles'grateful lion buddy.Hero to giant man-eating Mesolithic tiger:""Do not eat me when I save your life!""Okay, really? Add an insipid romance, a few veiled references to Atlantis, an enigmatic alienoid whom we're led to suspect taught the ancients to build pyramids, and a kind of Charlton Hestonesque revolt of the slaves and you'll be asleep by the time the credits roll.Other annoyances include...but are not limited to...a Fearless Elder Leader named Tic'Tic, a lovesick slave trader, the bizarre juxtaposition of what seems to be Africa and Mesoamerica, a remarkably silly Happily Ever After ending, and Camilla Belle wearing blue contacts; a totally unnecessary device since any blue-eyed brunette capable of scowling silently while being kidnapped and/or beaten could have played the role.On the plus side, it's harmless.","10,000 BC"

Unfortunately, the rules prevent me from writing what I feel is adequate to describe this abortion. But imagine this -- is salmonella something you enjoy? Is diarrhea a fun time? Now apply those imaginings to this movie -- and decide whether you want to waste your money on it. However, the preceding comments are insufficient for acceptance and posting, so I'll try to continue without gagging. Simply put, the characters are one-dimensional - even the heroine isn't particularly attractive - the plot is on the same level as ""See Spot run,"" the action (what action?) is infantile, and the wrap-up is laughable.

Or when you think of epic march through unknown lands, knowing ""the force"" is with the one who is marching? For he is marching to rescue his love. But love so pure and childish. Taken away through mountains, jungles, rivers and deserts to a faraway land. And when you know he cannot be stopped, for he will walk to the ends of the earth to slain down the one they called ""the almighty"", raise an army from nowhere which will put the end of an empire and change the world forever... if he has to.Trust me, your imagination is poor.Movies very rarely paint the whole heroic and epic and beautiful picture of your imagination. That is why, I loved this one! I will always associate this movie when I think of old,epic,heroic and beautiful story. And also for romance and mysticism, and the power of the universe... and love.","10,000 BC"

This movie is not epic, nor is it not historically correct (notice the costumes and make-up). The plot is ridiculous, but first and foremost I have to comment on the acting: ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! At least get some decent actors if you want to brand this movie as being something spectacular! Alexander, although the movie sucked, at least had Anthony Hopkins. Secondly, the computer graphic looks like something belonging to a children's computer game from the mid-nineties. I feel sorry for anyone who saw this at the movies.

Huge mistake  one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I never knew caveman bleached their teeth, since everyone had a perfect smile. No one had a beard and if they did it was clean cut. For example Marco Khan aka 1 eye had a shaved head with a perfectly trimmed beard. The main character traveled from what seems to be North-Western Europe to Central Africa then to South America(Where those BIG ASS BIRDS ACTUALLY ORIGINATED FROM) back to Egypt all in a few days. He encounters a saber-tooth tiger whose main diet included human flesh, but somehow he became BFF with the man-eating tiger. This guy is a cavity free beast man from 10,000 BC The creator of this movie is a moron  do your homework before you make a movie. You know what people did in 10 000 BC humped the crap out of anything that walked, got eaten by larger animals, died young and looked like those ape creatures from planet of the apes(Horrible teeth, dirty, hairy and DUMB - real DUMB). This movie Blows worse than my gay friend tayALt.","10,000 BC"
527,elroachomapper,High budget - low quality,2,14 November 2008,"I never saw any trailers for this and I had no prior knowledge of it's existence. I saw the movie on the rack at the local Blockbuster and decided to give it a try.From the title and cover I assumed the movie was about early mans climb up the food chain. Fighting to survive amongst the fierce animals of the time. The most abundant animal in this movie are horses followed by gazelle. The sabertooth depicted on the cover only gets a few minutes of airtime which bummed me out. There's one point where the sabertooth appears for a few seconds for the sole purpose of improving the main characters street cred (or more accurately ""village cred"") which got a roll of my eyes.This is one of those movies that just couldn't figure out what it wanted to be. To be honest didn't watch the entire thing, I couldn't. The slow parts are ultra slow and dull so I ended up skipping around to the action scenes. To sum up them up, at no time do an real people come in physical contact with the very few prehistoric/CGI animals.For instance there is a part where they try to capture and kill a mammoth, but the only and fatal blow is delivered by a spear that is stuck in the ground which the mammoth runs into - it's not at the hand of a human, CGI or not.I would have given this a 1 but I reserve that for the crap of the crap. This one still stinks to high heavens, but there are a very few parts that won't allow me to rate it at the bottom (aka the little bit of CGI there is, is decent - but there should have been way more considering most animals from 10,000 years ago don't exist today). But I also can't recommend anyone pay for this garbage.Another thing that's strange is that some people speak English and some don't. I doubt anyone spoke English back then, but why mix and match if you're going to throw the native language out the window anyway? Ugghh, high budget crap - when will it end?","10,000 BC"
528,evinfowler117,Someone flunked history...,3,14 February 2009,"I'm all for watching a historical fiction film, but this was terrible. the only reason i give this film a three was because the cinematography and acting were really good. i had no complaints about who they chose to portray the characters, and i enjoyed the look and feel of the scenes. what got me was the whole story of the film. 10,000 BC: granted, this was the time of the hunter/gatherers, somatic people hunting mammoths for food and shelter. but there were too many extras that the filmmakers added into it to make it more exciting. horses weren't domesticated that long ago. According to geography, and the way the film was laid out, the main tribe was in the mountainous region south of Egypt, where the Nile starts and flows north. the Egyptians hadn't come to exist during that time, so no people would have gone south to capture slaves. but the MOST annoying part of the film that i didn't get, other than the bows and arrows being used at the time, was MAMMOTHS IN Egypt??? Mammoths existed and died LONG before the Egyptian empire ruled northern Africa. it was cool seeing the depiction of the construction of the Pyramid, but the time line was completely off and inaccurate, too much so for a movie like this to be any good. all in all: actors: good! cinematography/ Misenscene: good! writing: terrible!","10,000 BC"

But I do watch a lot of movies, and really, its not a bad movie. Not the greatest probably because of its thin and predictable plot, but it is definitely worth at least one viewing and its definitely better then a lot of the junk 'critics' call good.But... most of the above comments mention that the route they took was through the Alps. I did not really see anything that said the mountains were the Alps. Also, the jungles were said to be Asian. I thought they were from South African mountains, like Eastern Cape mountains and went through some jungles and the deserts of Africa. Although I mostly study European and Mediterranean history, I do know that slaves runs were made to the southern regions of Africa, however how far South I am unsure.","10,000 BC"

Two of the hippies fall in love.Then the big bad other tribe comes and despite not outnumbering or having more advanced technology totally massacres the Hippies and kidnaps about half of the Hippie Gaggle. Continueing on the Apolocolypto Theme and now adding in some Jurasic Park, some of the hippies go track out across the jungle/desert/mountains of.....Southern Greece? Northern Egypt? i dunno, anyways, they go to rescue the other hippies, but are attacked by....Velociraptors?? But it's OK, despite only having wooden weapons, no one is harmed. Later one of the hippies befriends a sabretooth tiger and is thus named king of the.....Zulus? Yes, the movie now rips of an old British war movie called ""Zulu"", good movie by the way.The Hippies and the Zulu's team up to go free the captured Hippies and Zulu's. They wander in the desert for weeks until they realize that the hippies were taken to the North Star. Even though they wandered in the desert for weeks no one is harmed and all are in perfect health.They then move on to an Apocolypto and 300....parody?... as they find their hippie friends are being forced to build a giant pyramid in the name of Xerxes, god-king of the Persians. But despite being a bunch of adept Hippies and Zulu's, they could never defeat the combined might of the Persian and Mayan armies, so the head Hippie turns out to be the son of the king of the Greeks and pretends to surrender but instead chucks a spear at Xerxes.The End.......?Actually, you can't say this movie ripped off any of those other movies, Apocolypto, Jurassic Park, 300, Battlefield Earth, Braveheart, etc. No.....it was in 10,000 BC! long before any of that other stuff even happened!","10,000 BC"
531,kankantx,It was okay...worth at least seeing once,7,7 March 2008,"(excuse typos) Okay, I've read some of the comments. First the cinematography of this movie (when you've seen movies like Lord Of The Rings) is okay, nothing mind blowing although I know the mammoths, saber tooth tiger and pyramids too talent & skill to do none the less with some green or blue screen magic. Anyway, the story line was okay, it served it's purpose, bringing two lovers together, making a man out of a boy and a leader out of an orphan, introduced varying cultures & civilizations that were going on around this time period and tried to lay the story out in a way that would be 'believable' to happen during this time period.The acting wasn't necessary, wasn't bad just not great and I'm glad we didn't have too many subtitles. The main tribe spoke English for OUR sake. Basically we (the audience can understand them) as...they speak our language. All the other cultures spoke their language with a 'translator' type character. It had a 'happily ever after' type ending and made for a great escape from the real world.I'm glad I saw it but wouldn't pay full price to see it again. I think the only think I walked away wondering was.. It's obvious what some of the tribes nationality was, you had Africans and Egyptians, what I was trying to get was what type of 'nationality' D'leh's (the main character's tribe) was from. They had to cross snow capped mountains to get to the Africans then the Sahara before they got to Egypt so what type of tribe where they? Overall, it was a good movie.","10,000 BC"

People seems to not get the type of movie it is. It's not a bloody documentary, it's a movie which created it's own story, time line, what ever you wanna call it. So what if they mixed races/dates/events ? It's not like the very first movies which invented something outside of the normal lines of history got so bashed. This movie add a few elements from different cultures, ads some very good to great acting and tells a unique story WITH a happy ending. Yes, it looks like Apocalipto, but it's better, more interesting. There's more action, more thrill. People who rate this movie low need to understand that it's not a history documentary or something.","10,000 BC"

I get that there's a lot that we don't know about this time, but there are well thought out theories that this movie completely ignores. It's so inaccurate I feel like this type of movie shouldn't be allowed to give itself an accurate sounding name like 10,000 BC. It actually makes me mad to think that there are people out there, a kid for example, may grow up to believe that this is a true reflection of pre-history after watching this.If I could give it a zero, I would.","10,000 BC"
535,man_from_cancun,"10,000 Ripoffs",1,9 March 2008,"So there's this one village on top of the mountain where all people have dreads and they speak funny English (We rest here!). We see a young boy who falls in love with a girl with blue eyes. He swears true love to her. With the north star as his witness.Enter the village's Old Mother - a decrepit fashion guru who lacks charisma. She lives in this bone house with the rest of the villagers who are lazy enough to build their own houses. D'Leh - our hero - doesn't even have a house. Old Mother lives a very boring existence by being able to predict the future and get nosebleed just by daydreaming. She predicts that a four-legged demon would soon ravage the village Apocalypto style.The villagers decide to forget about her predictions for a while and go hunting. They drive a bunch of Ice Age mammoths into a trap. Our hero accidentally kills one mammoth.As a result, hero gets the white spear - a totally useless spear which is white. This same spear has a special rib-like casing which looks awesome but is still useless.Enter the four-legged demons. They're humans with freaky hair ON HORSES! Wow!The demons ravage the village, kill ONE mother, take 5 or seven men and - TAHDAH - kidnap our hero's blue-eyed love. Our hero is conveniently sleeping a few hundred meters away from the village wearing only animal skin even when it's snowing during the attack.Hero vows to get his 'people' back.With hero's father's BFF (he was just probably bored with village life), and the village's 'toughest hunter, hero begins his quest. Add another boy (that boy with the dead mother) to the list, so there's four of them.Just like the fellowship, they travel on top of mountains and in waist-deep snow. Hero sees pieces of blue-eyed love's (BEL) bracelet and exclaims 'This is from her bracelet! She's alive!The demons reach a forest with nice plants and trees you probably saw in Jurassic Park. Soon after, hero's gang arrive and they start a nice plan - free everyone! The demons are strong but thank god for ostrich-looking dinosaurs, some of them get eaten.BEL and everyone else gets caught again. The group caught the kid with the dead mother and the 'toughest hunter' guy, too. Oh no! To make things harder, hero's father's BFF, becomes ill because of the ostrich attacks. Fast forward and the 'dad's BFF recovers, and soon they journey together once again.That night, while hunting, hero fell down a hole very reminiscent of the hole where Jaguar Paw dropped his pregnant wife and son. Despite the many sharp rocks and sticks (it was a trap, see) which are EVERYWHERE, hero finds himself knocked out in the middle, safe and sound. Suddenly, it starts raining and hero wakes up to find out that a huge saber tooth was also trapped in the same hole. The saber tooth, however, could not move because of a huge wood. Because hero is a hero, he talks to the saber tooth and makes a deal (Don't eat me and I'll let you go). Hero removes the wood and saber tooth runs out of the hole.The next day, they have become best friends.Hero encourages the natives of Africa to chase the demons as well. They say yes and soon, they reach the 'sea of land' with no water. Hero remembers the north star to which he swore his love for BEL. They follow the north star to get to the 'Head of the Snake'. They reach the river but it's too late. The demons get on really lovely boats. There are around 20 boats on the water and all members of the demons's team as well as all their prisoners are all on only ONE boat. Who are on those other boats? They all reach a city with huge pyramids and sphinxes like the ones you see in Prince of Egypt and Apocalypto. There are thousands of slaves and mammoths are used to carry rocks.The city is ruled by a leader/god just like that stud in 300 and that dude in Stargate who surrounds himself with kids and people with albino.Hero encourages all slaves to fight back. With the help of a blind albino who encourages everyone inside the theater to laugh, hero becomes overly-confident.BEL, on the other hand gets scars which form a certain constellation. The high priests think this is the mark and they tie her in the middle of the platform just like what they did to Andromeda in The Clash of the Titans.Our hero is trapped. If he goes on with the attack, the priests rip BEL apart. But if he turns away, he lets the prisoners go. No one is breathing. Everyone wants to know what hero will do.Suddenly, hero throws a spear at the leader/god. Leader/got gets hit (wow!) and starts rolling down the stairs. No special effects and all and leader/god just bleeds and dies. Hero gets to shout 'He is not God!' BEL gets kidnapped again but she's brave and she stabs her kidnapper. But the kidnapper shoots her with an arrow and she dies. So sad.But Old Mother - who once again gets nosebleed - breathes out a blue fume (that must REALLY smell) which traveled thousands of miles and across rivers, straight into BEL's nostrils. And BEL breathes again! Yoohoo! And then Old Mother dies. Woohoo! Hero and BEL and everyone else go back to their lives leaving the city which is now totally messed up.Hero and BEL start planting corn and make babies.The end.","10,000 BC"
536,antoniothelawyer,Great Movie -intended to be enjoyed not analyzed.,9,15 May 2012,"This was a great movie full of action and suspense. The main characters take a journey, similar to ""Year one"", from a primitive Stone Age encampment to a highly organized and complex society, all in a matter of a few weeks. The viewer is taken from a Mammoth hunt, to the cradle of agriculture and on to the building of pyramids. The action and suspense is well distributed throughout the movie and the historical inaccuracies are only disturbing to the well-educated archaeologist and anthropologist. Frankly, the Sphinx is 10,000 years old, so it is not so far-fetched that a mammoth was used to pull some stones. I enjoyed this movie as a great Saturday afternoon treat. It is not a historical documentary and does not challenge our sense of disbelief any more than the many other action movies like ""Aliens"" or ""Aliens v. Predators"". It is a movie intended to be enjoyed not analyzed.","10,000 BC"

The title of the movie was the best that this movie had to offer. I mean who wouldn't be interested about a movie about 10,000 B.C.? I bet that is how this movie grossed over $269,000,000 with the freaking title! I can not decide which was worst, the acting or the screenplay? How this movie is rated almost a 5 is beyond me.

539,RBuce,"Regarding all the supposed ""goofs"" being mentioned...",10,30 April 2008,"I would just like to note that there seems to be a lot of commentary in the so called ""goofs"" section regarding this movie, commenting on how one creature wasn't here or there in such and such time period, and/or how they didn't exist and so on...and stating such as if it were absolute fact.to all of this i would simply ask the poster(s) of such comments: How would you know? were you alive back in 10,000 B.C.? and if you were, did you travel the entire globe during a time when it is commonly agreed that the only known way to travel was generally on foot? which would've been extremely hazardous and would take a lifetime or more.I have studied history and both archaeological and paleontological evidence regarding such matters and the only things that can be said for certain, and therefore would be more ""factually"" correct is that based on existing evidence and the ability to collect scientific data, nobody has ""as yet"" found evidence that such creatures existed in such and such location(s) during such and such time period. Just because nobody found bones doesn't mean they didn't live there...it just means that they didn't die there.second, to say that ""based on recorded historical fact"", something didn't exist back in 10,000 B.C. is just a pure fabrication of truth, and is fantasy, as there is no ""recorded"" history that could be even remotely considered factual and/or all-encompassing with regards to accuracy and truth from much further back in time than about 5,000 B.C. just because some archaeologist managed to recover some ancient tablet fragment from 8,000 B.C. or found a cave drawing, certainly does not mean that a clear picture has now been painted on how life was back then in a certain location, let alone the entire globe and where every living thing existed. back then, to the best of our ability to scientifically determine and the obvious lack of raw data, humans were not concerning themselves with scientific cataloging and recording of history...they were just trying to survive.my point: nobody should be stating as fact or with absolute certainty, anything about ancient history or existence unless they either can prove that they personally were there (impossible), or can produce an entire library of scientific data gathered by the people of the time and recovered by modern science. the ""fact"" is that nobody really knows for certain about anything that occurred on this planet much beyond known recorded history, and the general intellectually ""assumptive"" conclusions of paleontologists, archaeologists, and historians using carbon dating on dug up bone fragments and soil samples doesn't clarify anything as absolute fact. As time moves on and science becomes more advanced, then the truth becomes just a little bit clearer, but without the ability to go back in time and see for one's self...nobody will ever know for certain.There are many people who believe and understand that ""true"" history, even in recorded historical times, has been distorted, tainted, edited, modified, censored and twisted to suit the views of individuals and entire groups seeking to further their own agendas and cover up wrong doings....it's been happening for as long as we know of. It is difficult at best to undo such damage to the truth of history once the evidence has been erased...so don't contribute to causing more damage by misrepresenting available information as facts. stick to what you ""know"" actually happened...what you can prove on your own, not what someone else whom you don't even know says is true. let history draw it's own conclusions. Represent your own part in history by preserving truth.","10,000 BC"
540,zack_93,10000,6,6 December 2012,"10,000 A.C. (10,000 BC - USA 2008) directed by Roland Emmerich with Camilla Belle, Steven Strait, Cliff Curtis, Omar Sharif (narrator in the original), Tim Barlow, Suri van Sornsen, Marco Khan, Reece Ritchie, Mo Zinal. We are in the mountains, in a tribe hunting mammoths and talking with the gods through a shaman. One day he comes to the young Evolet that brings a Legend. This is his story. Evolet (Camilla Belle) and the young hunter D'Leh (Steven Strait) fall in love. Everything seems to be going right until a group of warriors attacked the village and kidnap Evolet. This adventure film should first of all emotions. Which does not happen at all in this 10,000 BC. The story is told through the clear blue eyes of Camilla Belle (which in reality is brown), the physicality of Steven Strait, through beautiful landscapes, great scenes of masses and beautiful scenery. And then what? And that's it. The gist of the story does not exist. The legend is told by Roland Emmerich without emotion, without involvement, so flat and even with the ridiculous unintentional falls. Too many questions remain unanswered and too many steps are rushed. Solidarity between peoples is virtually taken for granted and not just four special effects to bring the whole building and a movie. Great mammoths, one can not say the same with the saber-toothed tiger. Final ridiculous.","10,000 BC"

The civilizations, tools and even cloth design is so wrong that I felt offended (as well as humanity).

The example of building pyramids to line up with the Orion constellation (which goes only to round 1,000 BC) is completely out of space and time. (I don't have time to go through the dozen other things that did not fit anywhere).= If this is a historic or pre-historic movie, then it contradicts everything that could have happened through history = If this is a Legendary movie, then it is real bad = If this is a Sci-Fi movie, then it is too weak and finally, if that was a comedy, needless to say that 10 000 BC is not funny at all","10,000 BC"

547,btd-4,A different look.,9,15 March 2008,"My wife and I went to 10,000 BC on it's second weekend released and enjoyed the movie very much. The story was simple, but solid; a young man growing into the leader he was destined to become. It had a mix of a little bit of everything; coming of age, love story, action, and a reluctant hero. Now that I've had some time to digest the film a little, I've discovered another side; Sci-Fi. Bare with me. I'm a fan of Roland Emmerich's work. The Day After Tomorrow, ID4, The Patriot, Universal Solider, even Godzilla; I enjoyed them all. That said, my favorite Emmerich creation has to be Stargate along with the subsequent TV series. People have been complaining about the inaccuracies in his time-line in 10,000 BC; the time frame of the pyramids, some of the creatures, etc. First of all... it's a MOVIE. Secondly, and more to the point, it fits into the Stargate universe perfectly.Think about this a moment, the whole premise of Stargate and SG-1 is that aliens came to earth, set themselves up as gods, and enslaved mankind. They built landing platforms (pyramids) and began gathering slaves to transport them to other planets to spread their empire. When Stargate (the movie) begins, it gives you a time-line starting in Northern Africa around the year 8000 BC. As the movie continues, Daniel Jackson's theory is that the pyramids were built in the 10,000 - 8000 BC era. In SG-1 there's mention of 4 controlling Goa'ulds that were on Earth originally. In 10,000 BC, it's mentioned that there used to be 4 gods, but that only the one remained. SG-1... there were 2 rebellions on Earth, the first overturned the remaining of the 4 gods, but in the long run failed when the Goa'ulds returned later. The second finally removed their control.Watch this movie from that perspective, and you'll see what I mean. It could very easily be a prequel. A 5 second shot of the right kind of jewelry or well placed piece of ""technology"" and you're there. It may not be for everyone, those going in looking for a hard hitting action flick will be disappointed. But if you're detached from reality, like me :) , it's well worth the ride.","10,000 BC"

I even went in with a fair bit of hesitation about this flick.While there were many clichés and the Xerxes scene was VERY stale and almost embarrassing to watch.But over all I liked this movie, it was clean basic story telling, back to the days of old when there was a clear line of good and bad, there was a beginning and an end, without poorly tacked on twists and turns where by some hack tries to act the intelligent edgy artist with shock value, weird camera angles or 'super' realism...Furthermore to those that say the dialog is wooden, and robotic? These are supposed to be simple pre-civilised people, did you expect they would spout perfectly formed articulate speech, even in their own language, c'mon.. did you see many schools or universities around, no...? They are supposed to be simple hunter gatherer types not worldly scholars of language....Now I'm not saying that this was necessarily intentional, but really, their poor vocabulary or inane language skills can barely be a real reason to slander this film.Historical inaccuracies?

There were far too many conveniences (eg. so many slaves, but they manage to find them straight away each time).The acting and dialogue was pretty shocking, and on par with SW Ep1 and 2 (ie. that cringe worthy). Some of the dialogue between the main male and female actors (I don't even remember their movie character names!!!) especially when young was terrible.I think the movie takes itself far too seriously. It appears to want to be serious and epic, but then throws in some strange comedy relief moments that didn't really work.Overall, I think another disappointing effort from Roland Emmerich.","10,000 BC"

The cinematography was beautiful and it was not possible to tell whether the settings were actual locations or computer generated. Unlike what Hollywood generally delivers where movies use sex, nudity, and four letter words in place of decent writing, acting, and story lines, it was nice to watch a movie that a parent could take a child to without being embarrassed.

It is a love story. It takes place in prehistoric times, includes some monsters, and the lead goes on an adventure to rescue his love. But for all the guys that showed up expecting war between men/men and men/monsters it is an utter disappointment.

The film tells a story about the Yagahal's life. The Yagahal camp lives on a range mountain and survives by killing woolly mammoths. And all the campers were told that if any of those kills a mammoth that person can carry the ""White Spear"". A young hunter D'Leh was proved to have killed one and won the ""White Spear"", and his woman --------- Evolet. But a good time never lasts long, horse raiders what they called ""four legged demons"" attacked their camp and captured many of their campers, including Evolet. D'Leh, Tic'Tic(the leader), KaRen and Baku and some others are those who were lucky avoided being captured. They four then started their adventure on searching their companions, but unluckily when they entered the forest, Baku and KaRen were also being captured when D'Leh was away. And after, no marks and signals. One day, when D'Leh went hunting for his injured stepfather(Tic'Tic), he fell into a hole and fainted, he was finally awaken until heavy rain comes, when he was trying to get out of the hole he saw a Smilodon being surrounded and trying to be free. He managed to kill it, but he didn't. He set the Smilodon free and let go, and the Smilodon didn't attack him. After that, they met the Naku tribe when they were searching for food, so did the Smilodon. D'Leh let go of the Smilodon by only conversation, actually it is the same one that D'Leh saved the life on. A foretell which the Naku believes is that a person who talks to a Smilodon, what they called ""spear tooth"" can set them free, so they arose and stood with each other, and saved all their companions, and of course, Evolet.Although I don't like this film very much, but D'Leh's braveness and power touched me, and at last I would like to say...

Also, Joel Virgel, who I've never seen in any movies before, delivered a sincere performance.

I think it just tells us that the story happened long long time ago when civilizations were at different levels, when some people still lived their primitive lives and some other were pretty much civilized.For the language part, I think that's just the director wanted to make the audience more comfortable when they watch the movie. So which language were they speak thousands of years ago? 1,we don't know 2, even we do know, in modern days we can't speak it exactly how they were spoken, you know, spoken English changed significantly in just hundreds of years (in America and in Britain and even in Australia, people speak differently in these days), let alone in thousands of years, how would we know that the language changed in to what.it's just a fictional motion-picture, not a documentary. don't be too serious. for me, this movie was not that bad. it pictured how people were fed before agriculture, how the agriculture were spread, and the terms the primitive men used for things from the more civilized world were pretty funny, like ""four-leg demon"", ""big bird"", for what these words were indicated, watch the movie and find yourself, ^_^","10,000 BC"

559,raul_bli,Why people think that this movie it's so bad?,9,10 February 2018,"Firstly the acting was great.
The landscapes were awesome.
CGI maybe not the best in the history of cinematography but nonetheless very good. 
The story was very interesting, not the most complex so only people that read at least 10.000 books can understand, either way not the most simple one. It was right on point and it says enough so you can understand what is all about in that movie.
Maybe the only complain which i would agree if i would have cared about the historical accuracy of what happened 10.000 years ago. I can understand that the history snobs get very triggered at a movie when it lacks in accuracy on historical part, but come on, do you really care about what happened 10000 years ago? I mean when a movie has a lot of inaccuracies in more recent events such as ww2 it's ok to complain, but in this case I feel like people are neatpicking.
It wasn't perfect, but not how people describe it here, I feel like the grade that movie got does not fo the justice.
Have a good day.","10,000 BC"
560,stevekgoodwin,I walked,1,19 October 2009,"Look, don't get me wrong a lot of people like this movie. However, it's the only movie I've ever walked out on in the cinema.Narration... just screams: ""OMG we have a stinker! what can we do? Patch it together with a voice-over.""The story randomly jumps from one CG set piece to the next. One moment we're seemingly in northern Europe, then what-the-heck we're in Africa fighting a CG this or a CG that.It's an hour of my life I'll never get back. Maybe, just maybe, you could have enough friends, beer, pizza and background music to get through this movie but. It's even worse the the Phantom Menace and Highlander II. Enuf said?","10,000 BC"
561,pulling_guard,Worst (Best) Movie,9,7 March 2008,"Movie producers made a huge mistake when marketing this movie as an epic action movie. As movies go, it was pretty terrible. The accents range from British to retarded, and the acting oscillates from cheesy to downright horrifying. The writing was reminiscent of chintzy football movie scripts, and the dialog wasn't so much dialog as actors throwing lines at each other. The plot twists (in this film only called that because of tradition) were predictable, and can become a game almost as amusing to audience members as the unbelievable setting changes. 10,000 BC quickly degenerates from a serious adventure film into a series of ridiculous events strung together more for the opportunity to set up trailer-worthy shots than for advancing the plot. You would think that this (and the above paragraph) would mean the movie would be completely worthless. Nothing could be farther from the truth. After the initial disappointment wears off, the movie becomes well...there's not really a word for it. I'll make one up...ridicularious (equal parts ridiculous and hilarious). I went with some college friends, and here are the highlights.---Warning, Spoilers---1) Predict the plot-line (only exact guesses count) 2) Guess the origin of the accents 3) All of the hunters jumping on the mammoth net and then getting catapulted into the sides of the canyon 4) The whole saber-tooth-in-the-pit sequence, including one of the best lines of the movie 5) Realizing that the drawing of the D'Leh and the saber tooth was meant to be taken seriously 6) Coming up with horrible ways for the old lady to die because she was so incredibly annoying 7) Making fun of the King Kong moment between the lead bull mammoth and the girl at the end 8) The anxious anticipation while waiting to see which cliché the movie would end on 9) The parallels between this and every other recent movie. --Three hunters crossing the mountains from LorR: Two Towers --Crawling through jungle with giant animals from Kong --Revelation about D'Leh's father, Star Wars IV (I know it's a stretch) --Effeminate god-king, 300 --Spear throw by leader striking god-king, 300 10) The whole ""Head of the Snake"" thing. I mean, seriously, did anyone not go gutter mind during that whole sequence?Bonus: Saying ""That's what she said"" after the last line of dialog while sitting behind a family with two children younger than ten. You can enjoy this movie for what it is or hate it for what it attempted-and failed-to be. So take some friends, plan on talking for the entire show, and have a good time. My friends and I were, on more than one occasion, nearly reduced to tears because the unintentional comedy. One of the best unplanned comedies ever. We're already planning our encore trip, although we won't be spending $10 dollars on it anytime soon. -wma","10,000 BC"

564,manasofficial,Good film with a wrong title,7,5 December 2020,"If it was not for the title - ""10,000 BC"", I think the film would have got better applause or lesser bashes. If you are in for watching a historical adventure set somewhere around medieval period, then it's a pretty good watch. But if you are wanting to watch a 10,000 BC setting it's nothing more than a bad spoof.","10,000 BC"
565,leogautherie,An Epic Joke,4,7 March 2008,"Some movies are so unbelievably epic and great with gritty story lines, fantastic acting performances and mind blowing special effects that they stay in your mind long after you see them. Some other movies however are unbelievably retarded. THIS is one of them. But don't be mistaken, I strongly advise you to watch this. Why? Because this movie is so bad that you'll frequently find yourself having fits of laughter and discuss the film's countless flaws with your friends afterwards. Simply put, 10000 BC (which as the title suggest is set in 10000 BC)should have a tag of ""Stupid movie, only watch if you are an idiot"" written all over it. Upon reading the title, I expected a relatively historically accurate film (i'm sure many of you are also expecting this). However, if you are looking to study ancient history, switch to the discovery channel because you certainly won't be learning about ancient civilisations in this film. This film's complete innacuracy leads me to believe that the screenwriter was taught by drunken history teachers who read from history books written by scientologists. If you don't already know this, pyramids were NOT made in 10000 BC and I seriously doubt that they were made by Mammouth. Boats were also nonexistent and so was the ability to speak perfect English. The actors, unlike films like Apocalypto, do not speak from a tribal language. You could say ""Whatever, that doesn't really matter"" but if you mix the fact that they speak English with bad acting, well the movie becomes retarded and ruins any chance of realism. What was the director thinking when he did the casting??? Furthermore, the fact that the protagonist walks through snow like environments, rainforests and a desert in a matter of days coupled by him being attacked by a couple of big birds on crack (who for some reason have a serious grudge agaisnt humans) just makes you go ""Wtf"".If you think that I can badmouth this film no longer, then you are deeply mistaken. This movie is just full of clichés and copies at least 8 blockbusters (300, lord of the rings etc...). The dialogue is so corny and predictable that you'll laugh out loud in the cinema. In fact, the script is so stupid that you'll think that it was written by a bunch of 4 year olds who smoked a lot of weed. It's just THAT retarded. Frankly, i'm still puzzled as to why a director who directed Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow (Two relatively decent films) decided to ruin his CV by directing this excuse for a movie. Perhaps he thought that it was an opportunity to show off some impressive CGI (it does actually look pretty cool with some eye catching scenes with giant mammouth and pyramids) or he was just bored and decided to direct a retarded film. Anyway, if you are looking to laugh out loud in the movie theatre and getting weird glances from other members of the audience then I highly recommend this film. However, if you want to learn history or want to watch a cool action film then head straight for the museum. It will be more eye opening and more exciting than this piece of junk. 4/10 for cool CGI.","10,000 BC"
566,existence92,"Bland characters, but beautiful to watch",6,4 January 2011,"10,000 BC is a beautifully-composed piece. Nevertheless, the story does not seem to be 'finished'. When I first watched it, I could accept the disparities in the art direction. However, it was the lack of character development which put me off. The characters felt bland and as though as there was no heart. If more scenes were shown as to how ostracized D'Lon was from his tribe, I would have felt more fulfilled when he succeeded. Also, at a point, everything seemed to become ""too much"". It seemed as though someone felt ""Hey, that looks nice. Let's put that in."" Nevertheless, some things I liked was that it had many reoccurring positive themes and gorgeous scenes such as the battle scene and the pyramid. I enjoyed watching one of the shots when D'lon was running through the slaves (contrast in colour) to the prelude of the battle- scene and the wide-shots of the landscapes of them moving through the deserts. This vaguely felt as a compilation of other epic scenes.","10,000 BC"
567,superwasted-1,FREAKING Awesome MOVIE!,10,10 March 2008,"Personally i loved the movie. The story was awesome, the graphics were awesome. The acting may seem stupid to you lames, but it is wicked. Bad acting is Tom cruise in all the Mission Impossible movies, or Arnold in the Terminators. Hell even the bond films including the new one had bad acting. This was Magnificent, absolutely beautiful. This movie i would recommend to anyone. Just cause you Idiots failed history doesn't mean you can bash a movie based on the Human history. Even if it isn't a exact replica of what happened. Oh and Good job on the Special Effects! i loved it! So who else has negative crap to say about this movie? It came out on top on opening weekend, Hell it even beat those stupid bad acting comedy movies. Which ones where they again? Meh doesn't matter, Stupid acting in them anyways.","10,000 BC"

569,asenske,"A Great Movie - Watched it Twice, Kids Liked It",10,26 April 2009,"Great movie. If you haven't seen it yet, rent it. You'll probably like it.Now, I need to comment on the negative reviews I've seen...This group mentality bashing this film is really too bad, because it's an excellent movie. Anybody who berates a film and the actors in it because the actors speak English is just being a ninny. Did anyone really expect this to be a foreign language film or a fully subtitled film? If so, their expectations simply didn't correspond to reality, which is not the fault of the filmmaker or actors or anyone else. If English really bothers you just pretend it's being translated from the original caveman dialect. And for the people who haven't seen the movie and who just NEED subtitles in an epic adventure film, rest assured there are plenty of subtitles. The evil warlord and the one-eyed bald guy don't speak English, and all the tribal people don't speak English except for one.The Sound of Music was absolutely atrocious. All that English being spoken in WWII Austria! Robert Wise really let us down. Oh wait. That won 5 Oscars.Come on, people. Get over the language thing.And saying the movie is bad because it's not historically accurate is just plain... inaccurate. It's pretty much like saying Star Wars is a terrible movie because asteroid belts aren't nearly as dense as the movie makes them out to be, or that a long time ago women didn't wear their hair like Princess Leia, no matter what galaxy they were from.Seriously, you're already paying for the History Channel on cable. If that's what you want for entertainment, just stay home and watch it. You might catch the episode where they explain that mammoths had nothing to do with building the pyramids.I wonder if any of the negative reviewers crying foul over historical inaccuracies caught the beginning of the movie where the narrator talks about truth and legend, and describes this story as a legend? I heard it both times I watched the movie. All you history buffs probably don't tell very good stories around the campfire. ""Oh wait, let me check my encyclopedia before I continue my story."" 10,000 BC is more Kung Fu Panda (the stuff of LEGEND) than Encyclopedia Britannica, which helps to make it really, really good.No plot? What? Here's the plot: Guy goes on journey to save girl. Along the way he becomes a hero to many more than just the girl he saves.That's a good plot! Timeless.The music was great, too. I don't think I read any negative reviews about that, thank goodness.","10,000 BC"
570,adirule-1,Exciting and well done,7,13 August 2008,"I enjoyed this movie. It hearkens back to a time when the simple ideas of honor, love, and justice were enough to drive a story. Everything is done with a light touch in this film -- the humor, the pain, and the stories of family and friendship. The special effects are very good, and the action is exciting but fits naturally within the framework of the story.You need to approach this movie willingly suspending your disbelief -- or, rather, your understanding of ancient history. It should be treated like a fairy tale, which is really what it is. I respect this film for its confidence in itself. It didn't need the gratuitous violence, lame humorous sidekicks, or overblown testosterone of so many adventure movies.There are many abysmal reviews of this film out there. I'm glad I gave it a chance anyway, because otherwise I would have denied myself a great evening at the movies.","10,000 BC"
571,jtguy34,A big (but not surprising) let down,2,7 March 2008,"I give this movie two stars out of ten because I think that it tried awfully hard for them. While the plot was less than perfect and the acting was terrible at most times, this film did have some redeeming qualities. The visuals were, at times, stunning, and the lack of any real Hollywood stars was refreshing. There, two stars, now to the grit.If you haven't seen this movie already, don't. Instead, take your ten dollars and go to the video store and rent the following: Ice Age, Jurassic Park II, Apocalypto, Lawrence of Arabia, The Ten Commandments, and 300. Watch them in fast forward in that order, while at the same time playing Zelda: Ocarina of Time. When you are done doing this, not only will you know everything that's going to happen in 10,000 BC, but you'll get to see a few decent movies while you're at it.The movie was sappy, predictable, and disappointing. If you can see it for free, then I suppose there are worse ways to spend your weekend night, but if you have the ten dollars, and you're going to spend it, you're better off spending it on two dollar rentals and some microwaved popcorn.","10,000 BC"

The TicTic character is portrayed well enough; the others are cardboard.The plot is predictable - basically it is essentially a collage of outtakes from similar movies to date. The special effects are poor and staid, with the exception of the image of the dhows on the river. The physical film quality jumped in several shots - what they were doing in the editing room beats me.Watch it on TV when it hits the small screen. Not even worth renting as a DVD.","10,000 BC"
573,rambonaf,"Good marketing, Horrible everything else",3,31 March 2008,"When I first saw the trailers for 10,000 B.C., several months ago, it was presented as a blockbuster epic. Somewhere in the range of a Gladiator/LOTR/300 type movie that brought you along an quest of glory while awing you all the way through. I bought that, so props to the marketing team. Now thats the only good thing about this movie, and its technically not even part of it. Which parts of the movie are inferior to my great expectations? Well the acting, for starts, left me indifferent. Characters come and go and seem unimportant, and the main ones don't do a good enough job to care if a four ton mammoth would run over them. Its very unfair to pinpoint the acting though, because the screenplay is so all over the place you could stop watching the screen because of boredom for 5 minutes and they've past from the cold tundra to the jungle to the desert faster than a jet plane. Yet they're on foot. Its not even directed well and all the scenes that include a great deal of actors seem amateurishly done and fall into the ridiculous while I think they we're planning on making something grandiose. Even the special effects sequences(which are few and far in between) are sub-par or average at best. I know the standards have been set high but even 300 was able with a modest budget was able to make our jaws drop.The caveman setting could of brought something refreshing to the table, but instead you've got English as the universal language and teeth white enough the soap-less cavemen could be Crest poster-boys. Spending money on this is a universal mistake many people like me have made, and this has proved once again that a product often depends on its salesmen.","10,000 BC"

This kind of film is the same style as ""300 ""Troy"" ""Gladiator"" obviously different story. Realistic? I wouldn't comment on that as I have no idea what exactly was happening 10,000 BC, but I'm sure is pretty accurate according to historical facts. Actors? They were great!

577,dsanfrasico,My Opinion - Awful,1,20 March 2008,"Might contain spoilers (not entirely sure) but it don't really matter anyway because you cannot 'spoil' a movie this bad.I understood the film was not true to history and went to see it with an open mind. But I found it amazingly terrible and even though I knew it wasn't true to history they could of at least tried to make it a little bit believable to be even a tiny bit like realistic history at least. I actually found it so bad I left cinema to go to the bathroom and I didn't even need the bathroom it was just so terrible. One of the main problems was that the actors could not act for starters, how out of the auditions rehearsals did the filmmakers not catch on to the fact that they could not act! Also they did some kind of weird annoying voice all the way through. Another big problem was that there was no tension or suspense for the simple reason that I simply did not care if they got killed or lived or if he got the girl back, the only part of me that actually cared about any thing in the movie was the poor mammoths being treat like slaves with the tusks sawed off, well I would of if the CGI was at all good to make them look real, they looked real-ish in some scene, mainly the ones were you couldn't really see them. The CGI on the sabre tooth tiger was laughable ever seen the film 'Jumanji' with Robin Williams? Remember the scene with the fake looking lion, this is basically the same but with big teeth I guess it was realistic when it was made but we should be able to do better than that, but we didn't in this. Save your money and do not go see this movie go see 'Vantage Point' instead (its great!) but please do not contribute anymore to the grossing of this terrible movie that might encourage Roland Emmerich doing a sequel or prequel or any other movies ever (the latter works the best in my opinion!)","10,000 BC"
