0,SnoopyStyle,early fun,5,8 March 2016,"Mike (Channing Tatum) is working his dream of making furniture but he's barely scrapping by. Dallas has left the Kings of Tampa behind and the guys are looking for one last blow-out. Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer), Tito (Adam Rodriguez), and MC Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias) are going on a road trip to a convention in Myrtle Beach run by Paris (Elizabeth Banks). When Tobias gets hurt in a crash, Mike recruits Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith) who brings along Andre (Donald Glover). Mike falls for Zoe (Amber Heard) but the guys are joined by her mother Nancy Davidson (Andie MacDowell) and her friends.I like the first thirty minutes or so. It kept some of the Soderbergh style. I like Manganiello who is very charming and a little funny. I love him in the convenient store. It's the most innocent fun and I wish the movie stays with that feel. The movie should stay with the six guys having misadventures on the road on their way to the big gig. Then it tries to replace Matthew McConaughey with Jada Pinkett Smith. Matthew stole the first movie. Jada seems to be trying to repeat the feat but it's not the same. Then it tries to inject Glover in with the group which only jumbles up the chemistry once again. The Andie MacDowell section is interesting and it would be great as a companion scene to other more humorous scenes. The last thirty minutes is a long series of stripper performances. I'm sure it's orgasmic for middle aged girlfriends drinking their wines but it gets pretty boring for me. I like the first act but the movie loses a little bit of chemistry when it sets aside Iglesias.",Magic Mike XXL
1,Prismark10,Extra small,1,19 November 2015,"I thought Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 would be the most horrendous sequel I will see this year. It already has had a scornful review from me but hold on, here is a late contender.Well my wife fell asleep watching this which basically tells you all you need to know about this garbage.The first Magic Mike was directed by an Oscar winning director, had a story even though the script and characters were clichéd and had some arty shots with too much yellow as Steven Soderbergh tried to present his movie as some kind of experimental film with a lot of male flesh.The sequel has no Soderbergh, no Matthew McConaughey and no script. What we get are a bunch of guys yakking, some very annoying hip hop music and the dancing is not interesting or sexy and I am sure even the females would be bored with the lack of flesh or just not interested to see wrestler Kevin Nash baring even his chest.This is a cash in of the most cynical kind. I hope Channing Tatum who also served as a producer feels a smidgen of shame.",Magic Mike XXL
2,kosmasp,Strippers on a road trip,4,30 April 2016,"You could fault the first Magic Mike for many things. But you couldn't say that it didn't have a story. Didn't matter if you liked it or not or if you didn't want to either see Dudes stripping or female nudity (the latter being said by a female friend of mine who minded that being on ""display""), it did have something to tell. Now why do I say that? Because this movie does not have anything to say at all.Apart from men stripping (whether they have their shirts on or off shouldn't matter, it's not always about the pecs and flesh, but about what they do with their bodies) - and there is enough suggestions as to what they'd like to do. While that may seem tame to some (see some other reviews), it does seem risqué to some others (again reviews checking). But it does not hide the fact, that this rode trip is boring. Jada Pinkett Smith was surprisingly not nominated for an Oscar - even more surprisingly it wasn't the reason she boycotted the Oscars (I am kidding but feel free to like or dislike the joke).While the movie knows it doesn't have any plot it also does not have enough jokes to keep it up ... Yes that also intended",Magic Mike XXL
3,Quinoa1984,"entertaining dialog and some dances, but... story? character development?",5,12 July 2015,"Magic Mike XXL in a way is like the films that Adam Sandler has been making with his buddies over the past several years (think the Grown Ups movies, Blended, even Jack & Jill), where, and Sandler's admitted this, it's really an excuse to hang out with his buddies while going on basically a paid vacation. The difference in this case of a Magic Mike sequel is that there IS some actual craft going on, with an artist like Steven Soderbergh behind the lens and in the cutting room. While he is not credited as director - this is currently during his hiatus as a full-on helmer (I hasten to say retirement) - his fingerprints are still all over Gregory Jacobs' first stab at making a Hollywood feature.The camera and editing can get experimental here, which is good and intriguing; one might not expect things like low, natural light (see the Tatum/Amber Heard meeting scene on the beach at night), but it is here in a Magic Mike sequel and that is appreciated, as is the use of light and how Soderbergh cuts his dance numbers together. They don't move ever TOO fast or kinetically, and he uses cranes and other motions really well. Considering that this is, in a manner of speaking, an action movie, the action is presented reasonably well.The problem then? In lieu of the character Dallas being written off (i.e. McConaughey couldn't get brought on back post-Oscar, I suspect), Tatum's titular character rejoins for the One Last Time scenario, and goes with his 'Male Entertainer' buddies on a road trip. So, first off, no McConaughey, so what can be made up for it? Jada Pinkett Smith in a sexy but thankless role as a would-be MC, and Donald Glover basically doing his, uh, Donald Glover/Childish Gambino thing, and though somewhat putting on the stripper-thing is really not that physique. The other thing is more crucial: there's no story. Or really much character development. Like, at all.Oh, sure, things happen, and Mike has his moments with each character (oh, look, his phone to do all his work stuff is thrown out the window, as are all the uh, wait, all the old costumes, won't they need some of those, whatever). And there are some funny set pieces; the one that takes the cake for me involves the character played by Joe Manganiello in a convenience store where he does an over-the-top dance to a Backstreet Boys song to just get the cashier to smile. However, all of the hijinks can't mask how little there really is here - and how stretched it becomes at a near two-hour running time. It feels its weight and length especially in the mid-section, mainly in over-long scenes at a Male-Stripper party at night and a chance meeting with Andie McDowell's character (albeit she is one of the better actors here in her all too brief and kind of on its own intriguing scene).Ironic that Tatum gets a sorta, kinda, half-assed love interest here played by Amber Heard, and though less developed than the romantic angle in the previous film she carries more charisma and talent than Mike's flame in the first film (also written off for the sequel). She is practically shoe-horned in to whatever thin narrative is here, and yet among the characters she does stand out in her naturalistic way (at least as much as the script allows, which... is quite a bit actually). So there's a lot of male bonding here, some fine dialog that allows for funny jabs and even small, if minute, moments of insight... but ultimately, it lacks what a movie NEEDS to actually get one invested.It may have more dancing than the first movie - I didn't put a stop-watch to time it out, but it felt like bigger numbers, certainly with this movie's climax which lasts a good twenty minutes, albeit meant to be a showstopper and it tries hard - but Soderbergh's presence as someone who could corral the story and characters together into something more interesting is lacking. Kudos to him sticking around to make the look consistent and compelling though, if he didn't do more for Jacobs.",Magic Mike XXL
4,tavm,"While not as entertaining as its predecessor, Magic Mike XXL still has some good moments",6,8 July 2015,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. Once again, this sequel to Magic Mike has a meandering quality that one may not be patient with and for a while, I was thinking this wasn't going anywhere. Still, me and my friend were intrigued enough to keep watching and by the end sequence, we were still reasonably entertained by the stripping performances. There were three good scenes here: first, there was a sequence of one of the ""male entertainers"" performing at the convenience store in order to make the female cashier smile. Second, there was Andie MacDowell's Southern charm when talking to them. And third, when Amber Heard gets the ride of her life with Channing Tatum on stage. So on that note, Magic Mike XXL is at the least, worth a look.",Magic Mike XXL
5,preppy-3,In some way better than the original,8,8 July 2015,"Takes place three years after the first. Mike (Channing Tatum) is out of the stripping business and owns his own (failing) company. He gets a call from his ex stripper buddies. They're going to a stripper convention and want him to join them for one last time. They go on a road trip to get there and, along the way, encounter many interesting women such as Zoe (Amber Heard), a former girlfriend of Mikes named Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Nancy (Andie MacDowell).The original didn't need a sequel but who cares? We get to see a cast of attractive guys in GREAT shape stripping. The original seemed to go out of its way to NOT objectify the guys as sex objects. Not here! The camera gets up close and comfortable showing how pumped and attractive these guys are. Also the other strippers (Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer and Adam Rodriguez) barely had more than a few words in the original. Here they have fully fleshed out stories and characters. The acting is great (Smith especially was wonderful), the script sharp and the strip acts were incredible. The prime audience for this is women and gay men. As a gay guy I loved it!

6,oscaralbert,HEDWIG famously possessed an ANGRY INCH . . .,3,7 July 2015,". . . but MAGIC MIKE XXL's more like a sleepy centimeter. In a sense, XXL is a spoof of a spoof. This is a dull, pale imitation of cable TV's Cinemax Channel's porn parodies. Instead of simulating wild sex with clothes OFF, we have XXL lamely hinting (with clothes mostly ON) at things that may have seemed a trifle risqué in the 1890s. Though it was somewhat difficult to follow XXL's pointless plot amid the snores of the Bachelorette Party to my right, the main climax of this flick comes when Channing Tatum gets Amber Howard to smile (something he probably could have accomplished in Real Life 110 minutes sooner by simply dropping his drawers for her in Warner Bros.' family assist lavatory). This Snooze-Athon builds up to some sort of ""competition"" with NO winner, and NO opponents performing. XXL jumps the shark by bogging down for a seeming hour or two at Jada Pinkett Smith's bordello. Next it's over to Andie MacDowell's living room for another tedious eternity. (Smith and MacDowell no doubt are two of XXL's producers, or their molls.) Finally, Elizabeth Banks reprises her Queen of Snark role from the HUNGER GAMES and PITCH PERFECT series. Then the EMT's had to use paddles on one of the walker-bearing septuagenarian matrons seated to my left during this film to jump-start her awake enough to clear the theater.",Magic Mike XXL
7,anaconda-40658,Channing XXL.,6,16 July 2015,"Magic Mike XXL (2015): Dir: Gregory Jacobs / Cast: Channing Tatum, Jada Pinkett Smith, Matt Bomer, Amber Heard, Andie MacDowell: Sequel to the surprise 2012 stripper hit with Channing Tatum returning as Magic Mike. He is self employed yet misses the erotic life he previously enjoyed. His girlfriend has left and he just received contact from the boys to attend a wake. What he learns is that the wake is actually a surprise party to reel him in when other key players had left. Central plot regards one last exotic dance show a la Male Entertainers Convention in Myrtle Beach. Director Gregory Jacobs shoot this like a reality independent TV show that actually adds to its appeal. While the plot is nothing to write home about, the road movie structure works best when the male strippers bond over amusing conversations and hijinks that often halt their trip such as their MC landing in the hospital when their vehicle runs off the road. The ending is raunchy and predictable depending on one's taste. Tatum still turns it on as Mike as he consumes the energy on the dance floor in a rousing sexual dance off. Jada Pinkett Smith steals scenes as an MC who knew Mike years prior. Andie MacDowell appears amongst a household of cougars who engage the boys. Amber Heard plays Mike new romantic interest who receives the ultimate seat during the final dance off. The cast fare fine despite a screenplay that doesn't always strip away conventions. Jacobs is not Steven Soderbergh but he at least proves to follow what he has learned and is applauded by a theatre filled mostly of women yearning for more magic. Score: 6 / 10",Magic Mike XXL
8,siderite,Magic Mike 2000,5,29 August 2015,"I really enjoyed the first Magic Mike movie. It made me feel like I understand what women want, made me learn interesting things and Channing Tatum was excellent, plus the film had an actual story, with character development. This version is just the pumped up, former celebrities filled, more diverse, less Miked road trip version of the film. It was quite a disappointment. Not even Amber Heard's beautiful presence could save it.The premise is that the band is splitting up and they want to go for one last ""stripper conference"". Matthew McConaughey is gone, Steven Soderbergh is gone, enter black people and beloved, yet tired (and less paid) celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith, Andie MacDowell and Elizabeth Banks. The feeling that you understand the characters is gone, replaced by ""explanatory dialogues"" of why they are like healers and how they listen and understand. God damn it, every word I am writing in this review lowers my rating more and more. It is like a sequel constructed by studio lawyers with the help of focus groups made of mentally challenged people.The worst crime of this film, though, was that it wasn't about Magic Mike at all and had shitty choreography to boot. Channing Tatum's character joins the party as an outsider, while the focus is on everybody and everything else, while they are driving to the convention, meeting all kind of folks and giving occasional performances that seem like they are setting up the great one at the end of the movie. A performance which really sucked.Bottom line: I wonder if even women will like this film.",Magic Mike XXL
9,StevePulaski,Moves with the fluidity of water-based lubricant and charms like a serenading male stripper,9,1 July 2015,"Upon release, I called the original ""Magic Mike"" ""a film of depth and certainty"" and still hold it in high regard to this day, an opinion I'm frequently prodded for having. The fact of the matter was ""Magic Mike"" was a film that was enjoyable as a piece of fluff that showed off the talent and athleticism of its leading male performers and also found a great deal of success as a drama about gritty business and toxic relationships in a fairly seamy field.""Magic Mike XXL"" is in the perfect position as a sequel to degrade its predecessor by pulling a ""gotcha"" at the audience, discarding all of its thoughtfulness in exchange for overdoing everything it did with such nuance in the first film. It could've been an endurance test of the highest degree, soaking everything in testosterone and surface-level dance numbers that would, in turn, add nothing to these characters and their personalities.Thankfully, writer Reid Carolin and director Gregory Jacobs take over the roles from the master Steven Soderbergh to deliver a film that does everything its predecessor does in a manner that relatively mirrors it but not to a fault. A sequel like this operates on a field of landmines, with the possibility of veering into all glitz and tiresome dance numbers at every turn, but Carolin and Jacobs remind us why the original film captivated us so much by giving us a film about human pleasure and the desire to arouse and excite.We refocus on our titular character (reprised by Channing Tatum), who is now the CEO of his own company and is making a living away from dancing. When he is contacted by Tarzan (Kevin Nash), who lies and says that their old friend and coworker Dallas (Matthew McConaughey in the original film) has died, Mike rushes to find that Dallas went to perform overseas and the guys lied to him simply so they could see him again.Upon listening his old friends and dancers such as Ken (Matt Bomer), ""Big Dick Richie"" (Joe Manganiello), Tito (Adam Rodriguez), and their new friend Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias in a role that, despite the unlikely, rather fits him) tell stories, Mike finds the spark for dancing rekindled. He decides to drop everything and head down to Myrtle Beach with his buddies for one last dance to prove multiple different things. For one, Mike wants to prove that he still has what it takes to be a talented dancer but the other is something greater, something all the guys quietly want to prove.Mike and the gang want to prove that they still have what it takes to make a woman happy, joyful, and filled with the kind of excitement that she desires when venturing out to a strip club with her female friends on a Friday or Saturday night. Consider the scene when the boys are high off Ecstasy and dare Richie to waltz into a gas station and make the unhappy older woman behind the counter smile with a dance routine to the Backstreet Boys. The scene is uproariously funny and one of the most positive scenes I have yet to see this year, but it also works to prove to these men that they can still give a woman the fun she wanted.More of this insecurity sets in during a large bachelorette party that has Andre (Donald Glover), an R&B/rap singer and professional dancer, at the helm. Andre is a younger, ostensibly more energetic presence than the former ""Kings of Tampa"" and his ability to dance flawlessly and make up an impromptu song for the women he serenades puts him clearly at the top of his game. Mike and his friends, who watch Andre put on his show, attempt to change up their routine before they hit Myrtle Beach, to show the town that they can still do what those half their age can and do it better.Soderbergh's directorial flare kicked in with ""Magic Mike"" during the spacious dance scenes, which showed the entire stage as a playground for Soderbergh's tricks, with lighting, decorations, and choreography being placed at the forefront during as well. While Jacobs has less of an opportunity to showcase the large-scale stage dances, he makes up for it in the multitude of different ways he finds to shoot bodies bouncing off of one another. ""Magic Mike XXL"" has so many scenes including people of both sexes being lifted up, landing face first in crotches, sliding off of one another, and working off different bodies that it almost becomes an action film. Jacobs captures these scenes with intense clarity and focus, living up to the Soderbergh-style of direction I anticipated watching this film.Ultimately, however, the sincerity behind the emotion in ""Magic Mike XXL"" carries it places. Long scenes that take place in one setting, whether they are in a gas station or a luxurious home sipping rare and expensive wine with older (and younger) women, Carolin understands that this particular film can lack a ""point A/point B"" plot and still be a worthwhile experience. The plotlessness of ""Magic Mike XXL"" allows for conversations and real human connection to take place in a way that's remarkably beautiful, and I'll be damned if this doesn't end up being one of my favorite films of the year in terms of showcasing the human spirit in its most tender forms.NOTE: ""Magic Mike XXL"" is also one of the few films that could end with the song ""All I Do is Win"" by DJ Khaled and have it be totally fitting and not have it be pompous or flashy at all. This entire franchise has been a cinematic mystery waiting to be defined.",Magic Mike XXL
10,KineticSeoul,"""Step Up: Road Trip with Male Strippers"" edition.",4,2 September 2015,"Now I didn't like the first ""Magic Mike"" movie all that much. And thought the main originality when it comes to the plot is how it revolved around male strippers. But that was about it, but at least it had a emotional storyline going for it that tied it together in a way where it was coherent. And I actually understood the emotions behind the characters and what they were dealing with. This time around, it just goes in a very silly direction. Watching this movie was like watching a bizarre movie with bizarre characters, which I gotta admit was intriguing at first. But this movie is like another ""Step Up"" movie road trip edition with male strippers. And that basically sums this movie up. It's like ""Grand Theft Auto"" except it's focused on male strippers. Which means the characters have to take on one mission after another to get the the main mission. So yeah, it's like watching a video game that revolves around male strippers. The trailer is better than this movie itself and even the trailer didn't really excite me. Who knows maybe I am being a bit biased since it's about male strippers and what they really want to do with their lives while on the same mission. Maybe if it was about female strippers I might have given it a slightly higher score. Overall, this is a movie that most girls will like if they want to see Channing Tatum dance and show off his butt. And see other muscular guys dancing almost naked. And maybe some straight guys will probably like it as well, I just isn't one of them.4.8/10",Magic Mike XXL
11,Hellmant,Male stripping seems like it would be an awesome job!,8,2 July 2015,"'MAGIC MIKE XXL': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2012 hit stripper flick 'MAGIC MIKE'. This one has the star, Channing Tatum, reprising the title role (one of his most popular parts); but the original's director, Steven Soderbergh, is only serving as an executive producer this time around. Gregory Jacobs, who was the first assistant director on the original movie, directs this sequel. Reid Carolin did return to write the script, but Matthew McConaughey didn't return to reprise his popular costarring role (due to money restrictions); Alex Pettyfer and Cody Horn are also absent. Actors Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Kevin Nash and Adam Rodriguez did happily reprise their parts. They're joined by newcomers Amber Heard, Jada Pinkett Smith, Elizabeth Banks, Andie MacDowell, Gabriel Iglesias, Michael Strahan and Donald Glover. I don't think it's quite as memorable a film, or as well made, as the original, but it's close. The story (if you can call it that) begins three years after the events of the original. Mike (Tatum) was recently dumped by his girlfriend (Horn, in the original), who he had planned to marry, and his business is struggling. It turns out that Mike's old stripper boss, Dallas (McConaughey, in the original), abandoned his old stripper team and started a new touring show, with Mike's old protégé, Adam (Pettyfer, in the original). So Mike's old buddies call on him, to join them for one last big performance. Mike reluctantly agrees and a chaotic road trip adventure begins (fueled by stripping, drugs and sex with older women).The movie is definitely not as magical as the original, especially without Soderbergh at the helm (and minus Matthew McConaughey), but it's still a lot of fun. Male stripping seems like it would be an awesome job, if you're good at it, and these films do a great job glamorizing it. These movies also have some amazing dance moves (especially by Tatum), some good laughs and some nice male bonding (especially in this sequel). Jacobs does a more than adequate job, trying to fill his old mentor's shoes, and the cast is fantastic. It's not quite as memorable, or as classic, as the original, but it's pretty damn close.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ke2k3oL5gSI",Magic Mike XXL
12,MLDinTN,how did the script get approved?,3,26 February 2016,"The whole story line behind this movie was awful; how did it ever get the green light. It's basically a road trip with male strippers to one last final shin dig. Of course they have car trouble and must reach out to an old acquaintance for help. They do this at a house full of male strippers. Then there's the girls they meet on the beach.There is one good scene in this and that is at the convenience store and involves smiling, a bottle of water, and Cheetos.The ending is their new dance routine at the stripper convention. It's eye candy, just not interesting.FINAL VERDICT: Don't watch the movie, just watch the convenience store scene online.",Magic Mike XXL

First thing I have to say is that I am a man, so this review is done from my point of view. I thought the first movie wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but to me it was just cheesy and actually pretty much what I expected. I do remember there was enough comedy in it to keep me interested. This movie seemed to play on the women will watch the hell out of this so it doesn't matter what we do. As far as that thinking goes, it worked. My wife really liked it, but I'm not sure if she liked the movie or just liked watching the movie. This is a movie that is pretty much review proof, either you want to see a movie about male strippers or you don't. Not much else to say.

14,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,4,9 October 2015,"Magic Mike XXLWomen strip their way through college; men strip their way to becoming gigolos.Still others, like the peelers in this comedy, do it for the fun of disrobing.Duped into reuniting with his former exotic male dance troop (Joe Manganiello, Kevin Nash, Adam Rodríguez, Matt Bomer), small-business owner Mike (Channing Tatum) decides to take a sabbatical from his shop to drive to Myrtle Beach with them for a stripping competition.On the road, their truck brakes down and they must get assistance from a cougar (Andie MacDowell) and her daughter (Amber Heard), as well as Mike's mentor (Jada Pinkett Smith) and her crew (Donald Glover, Stephen Boss).With its barley there plot and clichéd road trip antics, this sequel drops the melodrama of the original and beefs up on the oily bare- chests and heaving homoeroticism.Incidentally, dry-cleaning is cheap when all your shirts consist solely of cuffs, a collar and bow-tie.

15,Reno-Rangan,Just not my cup of tea.,4,14 January 2016,"I have seen the first part and I don't remember I felt the same way as I did for this. My point is, this film is for women and maybe that including the gays. Being a straight male, I find it's not fun or entertaining, but I felt it pulled me further away as the movie progressed without balancing the content as a product for everyone.I know, no one asked my opinion. I respect the movie, at least it aimed for a certain section of the audiences. The road trip was fine to me, except the music and the dance parts. Thankfully, there's no nudity, except once, but still an R rated movie for strong sexual appeal.Whatever the theme was about, I expected a good story. But it was a lot like a documentary. No focus on any particular characters, but Channing Tatum was in a prime position. No development either in the story other than a group that embark a road trip to participate in a competition. Nothing anything like the first film, kind of detached from afar.So I won't expect you to feel as the way I did on this, but you could consider my points and can judge whether want to watch it. Still, I'm not suggesting to boycott the film. I'm neutral, and all I'm saying is that it did not impress me, but it might you, especially if you are a woman.4/10",Magic Mike XXL
16,tomgillespie2002,"Occasionally fun, but ultimately forgettable stuff",5,12 January 2017,"After the cult success of Steven Soderbergh's Magic Mike (2012) - a loose adaptation of star Channing Tatum's experiences as a stripper (or male entertainer) early on in his career - it was of little surprise when a follow-up was announced. What made the first movie such a surprising success was the way it mixed the flashy dance moves with genuine character development, making for a touching and oddly sweet experience that also touched on themes such as the economy and the American Dream. For XXL, the focus seems to be solely on giving the audience what they want, and that means more abs, biceps and bulges.However, this all means a half-arsed story-line that quickly finds a way to get 'Magic' Mike (Tatum) back with his gyrating buddies. The end of the first film saw Mike abandon the life he was never truly happy with and realising his dream of starting his own company selling custom-made furniture. The company is either struggling or about to take off, but it's clear that Mike is still unfulfilled, and when he receives a phone message from Tarzan (Kevin Nash), he is soon enough on the road to a stripper convention with 'Big Dick' Richie (Joe Manganiello), Ken (Matt Bomer), Tito (Adam Rodriguez) and Tobias (Gabriel Inglesias). That's generally it. Magic Mike XXL's main issue is that the story seems to fumble around trying to come up with interesting places to take its characters.Very much a road movie at heart, the group find themselves encountering new characters along the way. With Cody Horn not returning (her disappearance is rather unconvincingly explained,) the love interest this time around is Zoe (Amber Heard), a gorgeous bohemian-type who doesn't seem to be put of by Mike's distinctly douchebag-y dress sense. There's also Andie MacDowell as a horny Southern lady who, along with her wine-guzzling friends, indulge in a private party. Mike also hooks up with his old friend/lover/colleague Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), a sort-of stripper madame who hosts a house to entertain the ladies, and whose employees include the smooth-talking Andre (future young Lando Calrissian Donald Glover). There is sadly no return for Matthew McConaughey as Dallas or Alex Pettyfer as The Kid, who have apparently both eloped to Europe chasing a lucrative stripping deal. Gregory Jacobs also replaces Soderbergh as director.The new characters provide to be little more than a distraction from the meandering plot, which forces Mike and his pals into a few moments of utter tedium. When the film stays with the guys and just allows them to shoot the s**t, it's actually very funny, and leads to the best scene of both movies by letting a pilled-up Richie loose on a grumpy-looking gas station clerk. By trying to do more by giving each character their own emotional arc, it actually holds back a film that would be better served giving the audience even more of what they really came for, stripping. Even for a straight male, the dance scenes are electrifying, with the climax delivering an all-out dance-a-thon that allows each character their moment to shine. It made me smile between the dull moments, but this is ultimately forgettable stuff.",Magic Mike XXL
17,Thanos_Alfie,Second but not better...,6,3 October 2015,"""Magic Mike XXL"" is a movie which continues from where the first one finished but three years later. In this movie we watch how the lives of all the strippers changed in these three years and finally they all decide to go to Myrtle Beach to put on one a last blow-out performance.This movie was different from the first one because there was not as much dancing as it was in the first one and in order for the audience to not understand it they put more actors to play some small parts. Such as Andie MacDowell, Elizabeth Banks and Amber Heard. Unfortunately many people understood that and that was the main reason why this movie was not better than the first. Although there were some scenes with plenty of humour and that was something that tried to lift up the movie in some way.Lastly I have to say that ""Magic Mike XXL"" is a movie that had to be better than this and of course it had to be better than the first one. And that's because everyone will compare the second movie with the first and the important thing will be for the second one to be better than the first, and that did not happen in this.",Magic Mike XXL
18,leonblackwood,Not really for a male audience. 4/10,4,12 December 2015,"Review: I knew what I was getting into when I rented this movie but I really didn't know that it was going to be so graphic. The way that Tatum was flipping those women over was quite athletic and the dance moves were definitely erotic, so I can understand why women will love this film but from a man's point of view, I really don't think that it was made for us. Don't get me wrong, they are very talented at what they do and the choreography is top form but there just wasn't enough elements to entertain the male market. Anyway, after building his own company and giving up the stripping business, Mike (Chaning Tatum) feels that there is a gap in his life and when he gets an invitation to meet up with his old pals that are still in the stripping business, he decides to join them on one last performance at Myrtle Beach were they hold a yearly stripper convention. His fellow strippers also want to call it a day after the convention, so there close friend gets a bus and they head off for there last showdown. On the way there, they meet up with a few old acquaintances and when there driver/MC crashes the bus, he ends up in hospital so they don't have an MC for the night. Mike then goes to an old friend, Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), for her help and she hooks him up with some good contacts to help him. She also meets him at the convention and she decides to MC on the night and she helps them with some new moves so there final show will go down a storm with the ladies. When all the preparation is done and the King's of Tampa have there moves perfected, they enter the show with confidence and they give the ladies a night to remember. It really seemed like a road movie at the beginning of the film because Mike hadn't been with the group for three years so he has to clear up some bad blood for the road trip to go smoothly. Once all that is out of the way, it's straight down to business but the group never seem to be out of stripper mode, even when they are with people that they don't know. You don't get to see the characters individually so there isn't much depth to each of the dancers, except for Mike at the beginning. I did miss Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), who was excellent in the first movie but Chaning Tatum wasn't bad as the leading character. Anyway, it's a watchable movie which gives you an insight about the world of exotic dancing but from a man's point of view, it didn't do anything for me. Watchable!Round-Up: Chaning Tatum, 35, really did show off his dancing and physical expertise in this film and I must say, he did do a good job. After watching the terrible Jupiter Ascending he has definitely comeback with a bang with this movie and he has showed that he can cover any genre, after watching his brilliant performance in the Foxcatcher. With Gambit, 23 Jump Street, Guys and Dolls and Hail Caesar in the pipeline he is definitely making a name for himself in Hollywood. There are other cameos in this movie, like Jada Pinkett Smith, a horny Andie MacDowell and Elizabeth Banks but most of the screen time is on Tatum who has taken over from Dallas in the first movie. Anyway, the film was directed by Gregory Jacobs who also brought you Criminal and Wind Chill starring Emily Blunt. He also was an assistant director on the Ocean Eleven franchise and I did see that he stole the end fireworks scene at the end from them. I'll give him top marks for putting together a decent group of dancers who really did have talent but I honestly don't think that it was made for a male audience.Budget: $14.8million Worldwide Gross: $123millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their music/drama/comedies starring Channing Tatum, Juan Piedrahita, Josh Diogo, Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez, Jada Pinkett Smith, Elizabeth Banks and Andie MacDowell. 4/10",Magic Mike XXL
19,subxerogravity,Looks like it's even better lady porn than the first,7,13 July 2015,"So the thing about the first Steven Soderbergh directed Magic Mike is that it centered more around what it's like to be a ""male entertainer"", trying to show you that Magic Mike is not just a piece of meat and he has feelings and a dream (stop giggling). XXL acts more like a soft- core porn movie from the 90s Skinemax days only it's shot way better and its for the ladies.It's a formulated story about Mike,though his life out side of the strip game is successful, a run in with his old crew caused him to miss it, so when he discovers the gang is about to loose their jobs and go for the last big dance off at a strip convention, he joins them on the road trip. Along the way, Mike and the boys bond in a masculine appealing way that rivals the bromance that Entourage has. That keeps the movie interesting for any man whose woman is seeking revenge for dragging them to see all those action movies, by taking them to see this one.I must admit however, some of the routines were cool to see. After all, it would be cool if I could pick my woman up and spin her around my head toss her on her belly and dry hump her for a good 5 mins with the finesse that Magic Mike does it.Magic Mike is the center of attention of course, he's the title character and I must admit that Channing Tatum can move (I wish he was this aerobic in the G.I. Joe flicks) . My fav was a routine that he does with a Black Magic Mike (the fact that the movie has a black Magic Mike is hilarious). One thing about Magic Mike is that Tatum gets to be the block head he comes across as in a lot of other movies, but here it works. Joe Manganiello was funny as hell in this movie, but just like the first film it's so worth it to see ex-wrestling super star Kevin Nash stripping. I'm rolling on the floor with laughter.Don't expect much form this movie. it's not as innovate as the first. in fact certain sections of the movie act like a series of music videos (Check out the scene that introduces Rome, played by Jada Pinkette and Andre, played by Donald Glover (who gets to showcase his musical talent), but it still has a uniqueness to it, but I'm only saying that cause I've never seen a soft-core porn catered to women, and that's the only purpose of the movie, no matter how well it was shot it's only purpose is to please women. I can only assumed it did the trick. As for me, it was hilarious to see the formulated erotica I use to watch late night on Showtime as a teenager be done for the opposite sex.",Magic Mike XXL
20,PWNYCNY,A great movie.,10,6 July 2015,"This is a great movie. Channing Tatum and Jada Pickett Smith should win Academy Awards for their performances, which were electrifying. The story has an intensity that draws the audience into the action. The guys are not clowns, they are highly talented and intensely dedicated artists who specialize in a form of choreography that few can perform, even poorly. The story has a serious and upbeat theme - that one must be true to himself. These guys are not merely exhibitionists; they are artists who practice a form of choreography that requires a high level of skill and training. Their art has a universal message - that you are beautiful and special. What an upbeat message! Pinkett Smith's performance as the emcee is incomparable. Tatum's performance in the title role once again proves that he is one of the premier actors in cinema today. The rest the cast is wonderful. Kevin Nash gives a performance that is subdued and powerful. Each character has a story and each story adds to the strength of the plot which makes this movie great.",Magic Mike XXL
21,juneebuggy,Aging strippers on a roadtrip,4,25 April 2020,"I wasn't expecting much from this based on the first movie but you still have to see it, right. I'd hoped for a better story this time or more actual stripping but nope, this is more of the same except even worse. Story as it were follows retired stripper Channing Tatum as the band gets back together to put on that ""one last show"" at an exotic dance convention in Myrtle beach. For the most part this is a road trip movie and that's about it.There's no real storyline here, no interesting side bars, zero character development, the dialogue is long, meandering and hard to follow (actually I think they made it up as they went along.)There are a couple of cool dance sequences, but no choreographed routines or stripping per se just dance moves (or singing) and aggressive man handling of female spectators. Joe Manganiello does a very sexy act towards the end and I also liked the 30 seconds Channing bumps and grinds in his workshop while attempting to get his groove back and that's about it.",Magic Mike XXL
22,davispittman,A lot better than I expected,8,21 February 2016,"Magic Mike XXL was actually a pretty darn good film. The film is directed beautifully! I mean really Magic Mike XXL is just directed beautifully and it's filmed wonderfully. And the acting by all the cast is just great I was so pleased with the acting in this movie. Jada Pinkett Smith blew me away, I thought she did a fantastic job here! Also Matt bomber Channing Tatum Joe and Amber heard all did a great job! You could really tell that everyone was just so passionate about this movie and really cared a lot when they were making it! Now as for the choreography and the stripping and the hot dancing, they freaking nailed it! The stripper sequences were so sexy and well choreographed! But this movie is more than what you think it is, it's not just about hot men. There are some very heartfelt moments with great acting, and I was pleased that it was actually a quality film and not just a porno. Andie McDowell was great, she fit her role so perfectly! She was spot on with the lines and sexy mature dialogue! God her part was just so well written! And like I said before, the writing is well written and very dramatic. I absolutely loved the great chemistry between all the characters! I mean all cast members were so close and had really awesome relationships. And then of course it's freaking awesome to see the hot thongs and Joe's chiseled abs, oh my dear Jesus! Joe had my full and undivided attention the entire time, and so did Channing and Matt of course. I give Magic Mike XXL an 8/10.",Magic Mike XXL
23,jadepietro,More Bumps Than Grinds,3,8 July 2015,"(Rating: ☆ ½ out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: The filmmakers can adjust their junk the best they can, but junk is still junk, no matter the size.GRADE: C-Life is filled with irony. While driving home after seeing the stud dud, Magic Mike XXL, the radio station began playing You Gotta Have a Gimmick from Gypsy, that classic show- tune about strippers. Fate? Coincidence? Bad luck? Whatever, it struck me as a sign of the times. The gimmick was there: The bodies are toned and well oiled. Their moves well choreographed and fluid. Sex is for sale once again in this sequel. Only this time around, the sleaze is on slow-boil and the meat has been tenderized for consumption. The sordidness of male strippers is on the back burner as this film version celebrates the legitimacy of male dancers as a serious art form. Really? This is pure (or impure) fantasy, totally devoid of any reality. With all of its come-ons and dirty dancing (and no frontal nudity), the film never satisfies its intended audience.Magic Mike XXL is not a serious expose about the sex business as its predecessor purported to be. The first installment tried to show the dirty side of the sex-for-sale business, with its sleazy show biz world on display. Not so here. This sequel is a simple dance movie with lots of sex thrown in. It's more interested in all the right moves, but there's very little reality, plot, or logic. This version has become a road movie as Mike (Channing Tatum) and his buddies, known as the Kings of Tampa, deciding to relive their glory days by putting on one last show, an encore performance to go out in style at a stripper convention in Myrtle Beach.Dare I say, directed (and I am using the term very loosely) by Gregory Jacobs and written (even more loosely) by Reid Carolin, Magic Mike XXL is silly and naughty fun, especially made for repressed gays or horny females looking for the cheapest of thrills. The film just may be perfect for bachelorette parties too, but as a movie-going experience, it's limp.The non-direction is the main reason for this erectile dysfunction of a movie. The film lacks any subtlety or good taste with its groping and in-your-crotch shots. The film's salaciousness overpowers any fun. But the film does treat both sexes with equal disdain: men are sexual objects and women are sex crazed nymphs. What a piece of work is man!The screenplay is an absolute mess. The dialog has an improvisational vibe that is incomprehensible most of the times and stilted the rest of the times. It wants to impress with hip rap, gangster swagger, and non-stop f-bombs, as if to say, ""I'm cool"", but it all comes across as just plain silly and labored. The story spends too much time meeting various characters that never amount to much. Scenes need judicious cutting and go on endlessly (a visit to a black private club, a meeting with some older repressed Southern ladies, a drug- filled night on the beach).Most of the choreography (by Alison Faulk) is sexual gyrations and simulated sexual posing, although it is hard to tell what action is being done on stage due to the lousy editing that is too close for comfort and rarely shows off the dance moves and some of the worst photography to be seen in a major studio film: ugly, grainy, out of focus and usually shot in a dinghy yellow-brown hue. Surprisingly, Steven Soderbergh mishandled both duties.The cast is uneven. Except for Mr. Tatum, who really can dance, Matt Bomer who tries to develop his ill-gotten pretty boy role, and the charismatic Joe Manganiello who truly looks the part, the others boy toys just mill around bonding and getting high or drunk. The most uncomfortable of the lot seems to be Kevin Nash as Tarzan who plays his role more Neanderthal than human. Also adding little to the film except for a winning smile and nice set of abs are Adam Rodriguez as Tito and comedian Gabriel Iglesias in the role as an unfunny stooge named Tobias. However the strangest part of the film is a tawdry cameo by Michael Strahan (of sports and talk show fame). His contribution, a graphic lap dance with an obese woman, is an embarrassment of bad taste that sets back women rights and questions the real motives of the filmmakers and this television personality's dubious career choices. Adding to this debacle are the wasted talents of Addie MacDowell, Elizabeth Banks, Amber Heard, and Jada Pinkett Smith. The dance showdown at the stripper convention peters out really fast (pardon the pun) with no real climax (again, my apologies) as the film follows its predictable conclusion. But there are some dance sequences that do work quite effectively: Channing's all too short scene in his ""body"" shop, an amusing segment with Mr. Manganiello in a convenience store, and the final dance-off involving mirror images of Channing and Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss (underused) that become an R-rated version of a So You Think You Can Dance routine. (It makes sense since the choreographer and dancer worked on that television show.)As that clever song from Gypsy so aptly states: ""If you wanna grind it, Wait till you refine it."" Magic Mike XXL hits more than its share of bumps than grinds, with no refinement in sight.

24,Seraphion,Male strippers....road trip?,5,30 August 2015,"Well I watched the first movie just a few days back before I watched this. It seems like the movie makers listened to my view about cutting down the montages. But they did way more than that. They instead tear the original movie's basic concept and try to sink in some new concept that is usually in for high school movies or most strictly for comedies; the road trip. This may seem nice, but the fact is the movie cuts all the mix of the seriousness and all that portrayal of the male strippers literally out of the screen until later at the ending. They didn't use montages anymore for the dance parts, with longer shot duration and less edits. But the dance parts come in way less than the original movie had. The acting overall is just the same as the original movie, only this time it's without Matthew McConaughey so it felt different acting-wise.",Magic Mike XXL
25,rgkarim,Straight Up Eye Candy That Lacks So Much,5,1 July 2015,"We all remember that summer three years ago, when that masterpiece of a movie known as Magic Mike graced *has to stop writing because he is laughing so hard* I can't even begin to describe the faults with the stripper movie, yet someone thought it was a good idea to make a second one. Yet here I am on the first of July jumping into review the latest woman targeted film, which had plenty flocking to the local theater. Gear up my friends, and get set for another wild reviewing ride from yours truly. As a disclaimer, I'm looking at this movie for quality, not on it's ability to entertain, two terms many seem to group together. Thus, you can bet that Magic Mike 2's quality certainly doesn't bode well in terms of a good film. One more the plot is slop, a culmination of shallow story writing to flimsily support the sequences of shirtless men dancing in numerous settings. The theme of our tale SEX masked in the constant iteration that it's all about respect and living your dream. I applaud their attempt to put other aspects in the film to develop Mike (Channing Tatum) and his crew's characters, but to me the writers couldn't figure out what path to take so just hastily pasted them into the script. These tangents did nothing more than waste time, as they conveniently provided opportunities for our strippers to show us their talents, while ""helping"" out the community in the process. What made the tangents even worse is that there wasn't good dialogue to save the stupid, pointlessness that they were. Many times I expected some kind of romantic banter, or some hot insult that helped sell the ""tension"" in the group. Instead, the writers fail again, filling our boys mouths with cheesy innuendos, horrible pick up lines, and a bombardment of F words. Glad to see such talent coming our way for future movies. Most of the time the dialog wasn't funny, and they had Gabriel Iglesias in the film, and he can really dish out some memorable quotes. The excuse of this movie wasn't targeted at being funny is a shallow explanation for two reasons. First, Magic Mike XXL is characterized as a comedy and that usually means laughing. Second what woman doesn't like to laugh? Instead, the team decided to ditch the fluffy man early in the movie, and open up space for Jada Pinkett Smith, and her link to Mike. The acting itself didn't help either, with only Smith, Tatum, and Donald Glover really doing anything I can consider decent, the former of which still surprises me she agreed to this movie. You can see there is a lot of bad to this movie, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't address some of the positives present, despite how limited they are. We know most are going to this film for the gorgeous beefcakes lighting up the stage. You'll be glad to know that Mike and his buddies are back in all their sweaty glory, six packs and all glistening in the lights. Women in my theater were grinding into their seats, making accompanying noises, as the men grinded about the women. The stripper squad will tease female audience members in many ways, some involving syrup, sprinkles, and even stuff at out of 50 shades. Women will scream, giggle, and drool, while men will shake their head, groan is dismay, or like me try to gouge their eyes out. However, past the bumping and grinding, the dance numbers are actually impressive, especially when Tatum busts out his moves and shows some impressive feats of strength. I have to give the design team some props for their creative numbers as well, the choreography quite impressive at times when you see the coordination, before it transforms back to light porn. A music soundtrack helps out as well, all of the numbers capturing the mood and going with the setting. Unfortunately most are hip-hop and rap tracks with a focus on guess what SEX, which has become stale for me at this time. Overall, Magic Mike is a bumping, grinding, stripper experience that does its job of being eye candy. It's got moves, it's got tunes, and it's got the sexual hard core drive though with a little more finesse. Fans of the first one are going to most likely enjoy this installment, perhaps to the point of a third installment ""gracing"" the screen. The movie lacks in a lot of things though including story, acting, comedy, and class; plus it could have used some major editing to bring down the time limit. No surprise that I can't recommend a theater trip for this one, except for those looking for single minded body thrills and gawking at abs the size of a wall. Factoring in everything, my scores are:Comedy, Drama, Musical: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.5",Magic Mike XXL
26,moviewizguy,Everyone needs some Magic Mike in their life,8,1 July 2015,"Now here comes a film whose only intentions are to entertain and make people smile, and it's the purity of these intentions that makes this film such a knockout. In fact, Magic Mike XXL is so infectiously positive, only the heartless, prudish, and close-minded will be left without a smile. How refreshing it is to see a film that doesn't judge or criticize its audience and celebrates sexuality as something that one shouldn't be ashamed of. On top of that, the film makes a point about treating everyone equally and with respect, regardless of race, sex, sexuality, and size. In that regard, the film is revolutionary. For example, Jada Pinkett Smith plays a character who refers to women as ""queens"" and men as ""kings."" Additionally, the climax features a dance number where Channing Tatum and Stephen Boss (aka: Twitch) mirror dance moves to their respective attendees, despite their difference in skin color. Our male comrades also find themselves vogueing in a drag show. A DRAG SHOW. If you were wondering why gay people weren't included in the first film, well, they fixed it here. Also, I had no idea what vogueing meant, but I do now.But let's not get bogged down in the subtext. Magic Mike XXL is completely different from the first film, yet it's almost as good as it, with terrific performances from everyone. The side characters from the first film are fleshed out here, with each member of the Kings of Tampa getting their chance to shine. Apart from Tatum, the most notable of the bunch is Joe Manganiello, who appears in a dance routine involving Backstreet Boys' ""I Want It That Way."" ...as you can imagine, it's one of the best scenes in the film. Oh, and you get to hear Matt Bomer sing...twice. There are also a few new castmembers, including the aforementioned Jada Pinkett Smith. She steals every single scene she's in as Rome, the feisty and commanding ringleader of her own club, as well as a past lover of Mike. On top of that, Donald Glover, Andie MacDowell, and Elizabeth Banks are very memorable in their limited roles. Literally everyone is good in it. By the time the credits rolled, I exhaled deeply with a stupid grin on my face, having gone through a joyous experience. Sure, Magic Mike XXL doesn't have that much to offer in terms of plot or stakes, but it is the most unabashedly entertaining movie of the year so far. Whether you're male or female, gay or straight, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more feel-good movie this summer.",Magic Mike XXL
27,rivertam26,More like Half Magic Mike,6,1 July 2015,I'm not sure how to review this film. The first one was a surprisingly well rounded film about male strippers which was fun but had an undertone of sadness running through it. It wasn't really a film that needed a sequel. But here we are with Magic Mike XXL. those looking for a film to continue the development of the title character's story line will be disappointed as will those looking for the original fun streaks to be supersized. Here we have a film with characters who are somewhat interesting and definitely charismatic but the storytelling lacks any real depth in getting to now who they are. Now I guess that would be fine if it delivered on the other goods. But it doesn't although the dancing is impressive the film lacks the playful sexuality that made the first one so appealing. Instead it plays as an inconsistent underdeveloped comedy of sorts. It's no doubt that the film has charm and the cast is game for some improv work but most of the ramblings feel pointless and the overall execution almost feels dreamlike and directionless. I'd be lying if I didn't say the film had some fun to offer but it's too weighed down by trying to boost up it's own self esteem to find the movie it should have been. **.75/5,Magic Mike XXL
28,maurice_yacowar,male stripper comes out of retirement,7,17 July 2015,"Magic Mike XXL is just like those old Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland flicks. Some neighbourhood kids decide to put on a show. The slight difference here is that the kids are ""male entertainers"" and the theatrical climax — so to speak — is at the male strippers convention.Still, it's a celebration of Americana, post-feminist style. Hero Mike left the strip biz to design and make furniture. He rejoins the troupe when he's lured to the wake of a still- alive (but absent) old colleague. That's Mike's resurrection.The narrative covers the gender-role spectrum. The film first focuses on the male entertainers, as they catch up on their separate lives. Their MC is the most maternal, with his yogurt food truck. They move through a show at a drag queen bar, then the trad campfire romance, then a womens' sex club, then a private visit to some wealthy frustrated women and finally The Big Show.For once the film addresses the female gaze. That is, men are displayed in sexual postures and exposure for the satisfaction of the women in the audience. That goes against the groin of Hollywood film. So, too, the reversal of the Cinderella story, where the overly-endowed male — who hasn't found a woman who can accommodate him — finally finds ""the glass slipper"" who can. She's Andie MacDowell.The film corrects the assumption that sex is for women to satisfy men. In all three main shows, the men simulate sex for the gratification of women. As they spell out their ethic, they do what the women's husbands don't: ask what they want then give it. Revolutionary.Significantly, the women here are not uniformly beautiful. Some strikingly large women are serviced as selflessly as the young and beautiful. Its not just the abs, pecs and etceteras that are XXL here. But these men celebrate the women's beauty that transcends their physical appearance.Our heroes conscript one of Mike's old flames to replace their convalescing MC. She owns the club that makes its female clients all feel they are queens — at least for the night. She similarly calls the shots for the men's big show. She articulates their function — to idolize and fulfill the women's fantasies. The men find their magic in serving the women, not themselves.Because this reversal strikes at the heart of American show-biz the big numbers are attended by tsunamis of dollar bills. The women show their enthusiasm — and power — by throwing money at the men who are faking sex with — and for once mainly for — them. Here women have the right to be celebrated, worshipped, asked their desires and gratified, and for once they have the money and power to be served. Both in real and in reel life, that's revolutionary.",Magic Mike XXL
29,billygoat1071,Unexpected Fascination,8,13 July 2015,"2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",Magic Mike XXL
30,davidgee,Bump and grind - and not much else,4,12 July 2015,"The first MAGIC MIKE movie had something (not much) to say about the economic pressures that might drive a young, generously-endowed man to find an alternative' career in the world of 'male entertainment'. This sequel doesn't bother with much motivation; unfortunately, it also doesn't bother with much plot. After shouty scenes between Mike and the other Kings of Tampa on the Bill and Ted-type road strip we get screamy scenes in Savannah at a kind of cathouse-for-ladies run by an old flame of Mike's (Jada Pinkett Smith). In the closest this film gets to the irony that was occasionally present in the first movie, the club's clients are mostly black women, brandishing fistfuls of dollars which they throw onto the dance floor rather than tucking them into trunks and thongs. Clearly Obama in the White House has done wonders for the empowerment - and enrichment - of black women. A similar scene ensues in the finale at Myrtle Beach - more shouting and screaming - when Mike and the Kings get to strut their routines at the strippers' convention.I'm probably not part of this movie's 'demographic', although I like to see buff gents in the buff as much as the next (gay) man. We seem to have come a long way from the Chippendales. The guys don't just strip and bump and grind, they now simulate sex acts on lucky (unlucky?) women from the audience. Like the whole movie, it's lewd and it's raunchy, but subtle it ain't.",Magic Mike XXL

This still have it's moments, but we are missing something, it has the strippers, it has a lot of funny scenes, most of the strange characters are back and new ones are added, but it doesn't quite get up there with the first one (even though that didn't get a high score either).Again as with the first one, see it for the dancing parts, see it for the romantic comedy it is, have fun and don't expect too much other then being entertained.",Magic Mike XXL

Just kidding, of course we don't, we watch it to see these handsome dudes shake their a$ses and take their clothes off! The sequel definitely takes the dance routines to the next level. Just ask Joe Manganiello if he woulda bet that in his acting career he'd be doing a stripper routine in a Quickie Mart to Backstreet Boys ""I Want It That Way."" That's just the tipof the iceberg.And Magic Mike XXL has loads of good-natured self-aware hilarity in the form of objectifying sexiness. But the bromance antics and dynamic between the strippers with hearts of gold is what makes the film entertainingly watchable. Shifting the focus to the men of Tampa and their lives still leads to lulls in the plot, similar to what happens on an actual road trip.The absence of Mr. Matthew McConaughey is noticeable, and he is sorely missed, but the film still stands on its own. In a way, Magic Mike XXL is an improvement upon Magic Mike in that it removes the token but unnecessary romantic subplot that took up so much screen time in the original.Will men want to join their ladies when they inevitably head to the theaters to satiate their primal urges?

33,dcarsonhagy,False Advertising,3,9 October 2015,"""Magic Mike XXL"" is another needless sequel made only for a quick buck and that's it. The story supposedly picks up three years after Mike hunched away from the business to get married and pursue the dream of the white picket fence. He now owns his own business-- complete with ONE employee--yet he seems lost. Yawn. He gets a call from some of his former stripper buddies because they all want to go to Myrtle Beach, SC for one last blowout.Had this movie lasted only 85-90 minutes, it MIGHT have been bearable. Unfortunately, this little turd clocks in at just UNDER two hours. That's two hours of mostly TALKING about crap that nobody cares about. There's drug use, a trip to a drag bar, visits to former lust interests, and FINALLY the not-so-grand finale. There really was no rhyme or reason to make this film. I cared little to nothing about the characters in the first film, although Matthew McConaughey's character, Dallas, at least made that film somewhat interesting. What you have here is basically a sequel about vapid strippers who, if they are not stripping, really have nothing interesting to say.Rated R and not recommended.",Magic Mike XXL
34,angelsunchained,Magic Mike Comes Out of the Closet,2,26 December 2015,"How the heck did this garbage make over 120 million dollars? It has the worst script and the worst acting. The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because of the few laughs I got from this worthless trashy joke of a film. Clearly this movie is geared to women and gay males. Honestly, this film didn't need any women at all, as all the males are clearly closeted gays. The whole film they admire each others semi nude bodies and are constantly dancing and striping for each other. Time they all got a room and got it over with. Magic Mike thinks he is Gene Kelley and he is not. I found the whole film a total turn off, the intended laughs unfunny, and the chemistry between the main characters lacking. But, what do I know is that Magic Mike keeps working his magic and laughs all the way to the bank.",Magic Mike XXL
35,shawneofthedead,"A dud dramatically, but a delight when the clothes come off.",5,9 July 2015,"In the three years since its release, Magic Mike has infiltrated the cultural lexicon as shorthand for something racy, sexy and a tad naughty, generally involving gyrating male strippers whose performances are anything but kid-friendly. That's actually rather ironic, since anyone who's actually watched Steven Soderbergh's film would know that the stripping wasn't the point of his film at all. It was, in fact, window dressing for the rather dour drama surrounding its leading man. Magic Mike XXL hews far closer to its packaging. When the guys strip off and down, the film is a rousing crowdpleaser. When they don't, it meanders through a close-to- plot less no-man's-land, trying (and mostly failing) to recreate a little of the original film's glum gravity.Mike (Channing Tatum) has finally left the stripper game to set up his own furniture business. Things aren't going too well when he meets up with his old stripper pals again, all of whom have have lost their jobs following the unceremonious departure of their seedy boss/handler (Matthew McConaughey's magnetic Dallas, who doesn't appear in the film). Resolving to go out with a bang at the upcoming stripper convention in Myrtle Beach, the guys embark on a road trip across America - one that brings them new inspirations and connects them with old friends.As a film, there isn't much to Magic Mike XXL. The plot is rickety, at best, purporting to explore the inner depths of these men but rarely getting below the surface. Mike is frustrated that his dreams haven't worked out the way he thought they would; Ken (Matt Bomer) has bigger ambitions as an actor that fell by the wayside on his way to becoming a real-life Ken doll; 'Big Dick' Richie (Joe Manganiello) is afraid to break free of the routines planned for him by Dallas; Tito (Adam Rodriguez) wants to start up his own frozen yoghurt business. But very little of it rises above the level of inconsequential. Instead of tackling these ideas head-on, Reid Carolin's script sidesteps them - either by listlessly providing Mike with a new, woefully underwritten romantic prospect (Amber Heard) or flinging in yet another frenetic dance sequence performed by a barely clothed man.The road-trip aspect of the film plays out as a sort of bizarre fever dream, boasting a couple of good ideas that get worn out very quickly. When an accident robs them of both emcee and vehicle, Mike hooks up with Rome - a role originally written for a man, but played with savvy, sultry aplomb by Jada Pinkett Smith. There's something quite thrilling about Rome's dark, seductive establishment, clearly set up to give black women a safe space to indulge in flights of escapist fantasy. The dudes also blunder into an upper-class home filled with older white ladies - led by Andie MacDowell and her extreme Southern accent - all repressed and in need of a little sexual healing.These are great, fun ideas to start with, hinting at the desires and sexuality of entire subsets of women who are usually forgotten by the mainstream media. But they lose both point and impact as the movie rambles on, unfolding in long, almost languorous stretches that would benefit from a little punch and editing. (Apologies, Mr. Soderbergh, but it's true. And yes, it was Soderbergh who cut the film together under the pseudonym 'Mary Ann Bernard', and also doubled up as its cinematographer, Peter Andrews.) It doesn't help, either, that director Gregory Jacobs - promoted from first assistant director on Magic Mike - favours a faux art-house vibe for what is essentially an incredibly mainstream film: his actors mumble their way through not particularly meaningful bursts of dialogue, shot in portentous shadow when away from the spotlight and jockstraps.What Magic Mike XXL does have going for it is, well, the stripping. Unlike the first film, which regales anyone who buys a ticket for the beefcake with healthy servings of moody drama about drained finances and male pride, the stripping is the unqualified highlight of this entire experience. Richie's goofily sincere attempt to make a grim gas station attendant smile is as silly, charming and sexy as the huge set-pieces performed by Mike and his buddies when they finally make it to the convention. It's impossible not to be tickled by the ways in which these guys strut their stuff and - in a nice, earnestly cheesy touch - do it all just to make ordinary women smile. After all, when presented in so altruistic a fashion, who could fail to be charmed by Tatum's ultra-slick dance moves, Bomer's beautiful singing voice, and Manganiello's outrageously chiselled body?If you're hoping for a film that faithfully replicates Soderbergh's more sombre, thoughtful Magic Mike, you'll be sorely disappointed. The brooding drama and man-pain were, secretly, the point of the first film. In contrast, this looser, sillier and upsized effort - hence the XXL in the title - does exactly what it says on the tin and more. Indeed, it fumbles precisely when it tries to pump up its narrative with anything less flimsy than a G-string. But, come purely for the eye candy, and you'll be amply rewarded with many saucy, sexy scenes of scantily clad men dancing around, over and on top of utterly delighted women.",Magic Mike XXL

38,CleveMan66,"""Magic Mike XXL"" doesn't have enough to satisfy.",2,4 July 2015,"It's early July. The movies duking it out at the box office include one about a Teddy bear which has come to life and another is about a group of male strippers. The year is 2012. That's right, the original ""Ted"" and the first ""Magic Mike"" hit theaters on the same day in late June 2012 and the first weekend in July saw them both going at it in Round 2 of their weekend box office competition. (""Ted"" beat ""Magic Mike"" at the box office each of those first two weekends, and every other weekend that both movies were in theaters.) Almost exactly 3 years later, each movie had a sequel in theaters, but with one big difference. ""Ted 2"" improved on the quality of its predecessor. ""Magic Mike XXL"" (R, 1:55) not so much.Mirroring the time between the two movies hitting theaters, the action in ""Magic Mike XXL"" takes place three years after the story of that handful of studly strippers leaves off at the end of the 2012 original. Mike Lane (Channing Tatum) is running his own custom furniture business, which was his motivation for leaving the ""Kings of Tampa"" at the end of the first film. He's living his dream, but without the girl of the same. His budding relationship with Brooke is no longer budding and, to be honest, his business is not exactly bearing a lot of fruit either. Mike decides to take a break from his life to try to rekindle that old Mike magic, and spend some time with his bros, not to so much to share a six pack, as to show off his.Most of the gang is back for the sequel (the most notable absence being Matthew McConaughey) and there are a few new sets of abs on screen as well. Mike joins the innocent-looking and spiritual Ken (Matt Bomer), sexually frustrated ladies' man Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), mountain of a man Tarzan (Kevin Nash) as well as Tito (Adam Rodriguez) and Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias), whose characters aren't, ahem, fleshed out as well, on a road trip to a male stripper's convention in Myrtle Beach. Their transportation at the beginning of the movie is a food truck. (Insert beefcake joke here). By the time they arrive in South Carolina, they're down one teammate, but are cruising along in a much nicer ride.The guys also make some new friends along the way. In Savannah, they entertain a small group of rich southern women, including Nancy (Andie MacDowell), who happens to be the mother of some girls they met at the beach. Earlier, one of guys accepts a challenge to dance for an apparently humorless convenience store clerk in an attempt to make her smile, and they all dance at the private club of one of Mike's old, ahem, acquaintances, the confident, flamboyant emcee, Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), in her private club for women, where they meet her performers, who may be familiar to fans of morning talk shows, quirky NBC sitcoms and freestyle hip-hop dancing (Michael Strahan, Donald Glover and Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss, respectively). Lastly, they gain a groupie of sorts in the person of a young female drifter named Zoe (Amber Heard), whose self-chosen nickname is too risqué for me to use in this review.""Magic Mike XXL"", despite its name, can be described in two words: not enough. There is a basic plot, but it's not enough. The story of the guys heading to a male stripper convention feels like just an excuse to put them in various situations where they can dance and act sexy. (If anyone reading this is tempted to remind me that that's what this movie is supposed to be about, I'd like to say that the first film had an actual plot, and a pretty well-constructed one at that.) The rapport and the banter among the guys and between Mike and Zoe is occasionally entertaining, but not enough of the time. The dancing (especially with the big buildup to Myrtle Beach) and the amount of skin on display is well, you get the idea. I can't imagine this movie really satisfying the target audience, much less the casual movie goer. ""C-""",Magic Mike XXL

Boring, depressing I wonder who could really like it: girls? I doubt it. Men? Not a chance. I won't tell a word about the plot, as IMDb warns me not to do it. I will only state my disappointment for the lack of an entertaining story, a catching character or a good show. A terrible wasting of good actors and time.",Magic Mike XXL
40,abouhelier-r,Magic Mike XXL,9,11 July 2015,"Three years after Mike bowed out of the stripper life at the top of his game, he and the remaining Kings of Tampa hit the road to Myrtle Beach to put on one last blow- out performance.They're back with abs more defined than ever, Steven Soderbergh's praised Magic Mike is back for another go-round: this time with his longtime assistant, director Gregory Jacobs at the helm. A lot of women might have been disappointed in the first movie as it actually explored more of those men's life, what they do and the hardship it is to live that type of lifestyle. After three years in the making the project wasn't exactly a rush job. This mixed road trip and musical: this new breed provides a sense of structure. One of the major theme is something they talk about a lot in the film: the idea of being everything this person you're dancing for in this moment needs, everything this woman needs right now, you can give that to her and she loves you for it. It's philosophical. The film explores the strange beauty of that. They dance because they love it, they've chosen a legitimate career bringing happiness to the ladies of the world. Characters are all rethinking the male burlesque but it's exactly the same thing all over again for the muscly strippers, except with no Matthew McConaughey this time around. Channing Tatum is a very good dancer, but there's none of the physical brilliance of Tatum's performance in the Oscar worthy wrestling movie Foxcatcher; nor the wit and fun of his cop in 21 & 22 Jump Street. This film really deals with the camaraderie among those men, the conversations they have about what they do, their view point on their position in life and the way they affect the women their dancing for. While the draw of handsome men in their underwear is obvious, it's the chemistry between them that makes Mike Magic. These laid-back ladies' men manage to be blocky and vulnerable, in their geniality, old fashioned manners and tendency to put women on a pedestal. They're a welcomed antidote to the obnoxious all-male ensembles that have become mainstream in commercial comedy (Earliest Entourage being the best example). The attitude is that we all (mostly) know why we're here and let's have a good time! Writers have junked the do-I-really-want-to-be-a-male-stripper concept which allegedly gave the first movie depth, or at any rate some dramatic interest. There's no narrative pull or jeopardy about anything that happens on screen. Even the movie reminds you , just before its final showdown, that there's nothing at stakes here, nothing to be won or lost. Just the joy of amazingly sculpted bodies in motion. This fact increased the quotient of pure entertainment by lowering its ambitions. Stripping isn't comic or tragic: it's just great! However the film is actually a lot deeper than you might expect; with a quick witted script that refuses to take it all seriously as its simply notes the passage of time while stressing the importance of living in the present and making the most of your gifts. Their ideas is to make all the ladies in their audience feel special and catered, that it's about them but in a self consciously fun way, not as dominance. We're all invited to believe that this is of course not demeaning or ironic but romantic and fun. In this consciously fun way a positive energy is building throughout the movie from scene to scene until the explosive finale. Indeed, it's a gorgeous looking and beautifully shot movie (in every possible way...), with excellent cinematography and lightning, very similar to the first one. This isn't the MTV movie the trailer tries to make you think it is. Moreover, I may not be entirely over this fantastic gaz station scene, involving Joe Manganiello and a Backstreet Boys' song. Freaking good! Plus, there's one moment when the movie regain its soul and comes alive in its goofy way; it's when Mike is in his workshop, brooding about the possibility of hitting the road again and he improvises a little dance routine around his saws, drills and workbench. It's silly, but there's some flair, mostly because it's not weighed down with mock sexiness and the need to patronise women with naughty but nice pelvic thrusting. Finally, Magic Mike XXL is set in the real world too but delivers more of that original promises: you want the hottest male strippers, you got them. It may be the gayest straight film ever made or the straightest gay one and I don't care either way because this film is ridiculously entertaining. Overall, this film might be deceptive for a certain demographic because it's actually a well shot, well filmed, dealing with interesting and well acted character. In some ways Magic Mike XXL is the film that many feared the original might be (and wasn't). Channing Tatum still packs a bagful of charm along with his merry band of male strippers.",Magic Mike XXL
41,stephendaxter,"Just some light-hearted fun and comedy, oh, and strippers",6,17 September 2015,"When you review movies, there is occasionally that film that comes along that is not marketed to you at all, doesn't appeal to you at all, yet you still decide to sit through it and hopefully come out on the other end awake at least; this, was that film. This film was not made for me and i was not interested in the film, so before deciding to check this out i genuinely thought i was going to hate this film, but after watching it, there was just something about it that made this movie a surprisingly enjoyable one. I gotta say it; i actually enjoyed Magic Mike XXL. For the most part it is just a fun movie with a good amount of comedy and likable characters that happens to be about strippers. The film struggles with pacing during the second act but i would say the fun light-hearted tones during the first and third acts made up for it. I did not see the first Magic Mike so i was being introduced to these characters for the first time in this film and i gotta say, the film-makers did a great job at quickly introducing or re-introducing these characters in a way that gave me a quick overview of their personality and allowed the film to just move on. This really helped me get behind these characters' actions throughout the film, well for most of the film.The first 40 minutes of this movie i really enjoyed, it felt like a road trip film with a group of guys who had good chemistry and it was really funny. The film wasn't taking itself seriously, it knew it was just here to entertain its target audience so it had fun with setting up surprisingly very well choreographed 'dance' scenes that not only appealed to the female audience but i thought was some pretty good comedy that got me laughing quite a bit. Everyone played their part in making this section entertaining, Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, and Gabriel Iglesias were the drivers of this comedy and were putting in good performances. I won't spoil anything but at a certain moment an event happens and in a heartbeat the film just flipped its overall tone and just lost me. It ditched the light-hearted, careless fun tone and the fast pace for a more slow, plot driven, and i guess meaningful tone. It was almost like one guy wanted a fun comedic film and someone wanted a serious stripper film so rather than picking one, they went with both and split it down the middle. And for the next 45 minutes i was just barely hanging in there with the hope that it would go back to what was good in the first act. But despite the very slow and quite uninteresting middle portion of the film, the relatively short third act bought back some of the fun from the first act and some 'interesting' dance routines that actually helped the film finish off kinda strong despite the vent end going by really quickly. This is one of the surprises of the year, i never thought i would come out of a film about male strippers saying that i actually somewhat enjoyed it, but i really did. If you are a female then yes you will most definitely like this movie i don't need to tell you that, otherwise if you are not, you probably won't, but there is some fun to be had if you don't focus on the fact that you are watching a movie about almost naked men dancing. - 5.8",Magic Mike XXL
42,AZINDN,"Sexy for all genders and persuasions, but a lite, silly entertainment",3,6 July 2015,"Not one of the greatest moments in film dance history or even soft porn fantasy, but a summer comedy high on male buffness and little in elegant dialogue. Bros on the road flick thanks to a roach coach transport, these ""male entertainers"" aka strippers decide to give it one last go before hanging up their thongs. Given that premise, there are girls to pleasure, rich WASPs to snog, and the latent young woman who is defiant and self-possessed who must be charmed by dance-man Channing Tatum. Although a better than average street dancer, Mr. Tatum is not the sole dance eye-candy. Trying to demonstrate that he is seeking a better and more normal life than that of gypsy strip king, Tatum's character runs a furniture design shop but hits the road with his buddies because of friendship. Joe Mangienello is more vocal and takes second lead to make audiences drool with his parody of the Cindy Crawford Pepsi commercial of yore. Other men such as Matt Bommer add to the storyline but minimally as the story basically follows a Jada Pinkett-Smith/Tatum reunite, nevertheless, their chemistry lacking, the age difference remained too obvious to hold any interest. In fact, there are more ladies of a certain age (Andie MacDowell) throughout with the exception of Mrs. Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, who gets the dream role of a gymnastic lap dance from Tatum.In the end, the guys get to strut, local ladies get a chance to toss dollar bills at some of the hunkiest actors in Hollywood, and the film ends with a happy group hug. The subtle homo-erotic interplay with the males keeps the film from becoming too estrogen-centric, and the ladies of size are also well represented in front and center stage antics. The representation of every and all makes this film PC, but at my screening, the theater was almost empty, and Anglo women 20- 50 the principal audience.

The show is without question the best part of the movie (and keep in mind - this movie caters to females who would love to go to a male strip club like the ones in Magic Mike, but have to settle for the movie instead). It's definitely a blow-out performance, and although I admittedly never finished the first movie, it's definitely way more scandalous than the performances I saw in the first Magic Mike. Other than the dancing scenes in strip clubs, the rest of the movie lacks sustenance. There are some pretty funny and awkward scenes (and lots and lots of chiseled abdominals ;)) but other than that - it's pretty much just a bunch of guys on a road trip. A typical friendship/bonding movie. At times it doesn't feel like a movie but just a glorified home movie of a group with MDMA thrown in the mix. It's not terrible.

This is when our boys actually strip down to speedos and jock straps. Wow. Channing Tatum, the main star, was all over the media months before the premiere, assuring one and all that this sequel to the highly successful original, ""Magic Mike,"" definitely deserves a ""hard X"" since it'll show off a lot more of the guys than previously seen.

Then we come to big stripper event. We're tantalized by seeing other male strippers preparing for the show but we never see them. All we see is a hysterical carnival like routine featuring Tatum, Joe and Matt Bonner. They whirl around, move their hips against women and when they finish, we realize none of our hotties even showed their butts, let alone their joy sticks.

When we catch up with Mike, we see him trying to live his new life, retired from stripping and working for his custom furniture business.

Opportunity soon comes knocking when his friends look him up as they travel to Myrtle Beach, S.C., for a stripper convention. With the promise of outrageous fun, he just can't resist the chance to join in and take it off again. Even though his friends looked him up again, resentment remains as some have not forgiven him for leaving them.

This is their last ride and they want to leave on top and the gang goes through a journey of self-discovery to find out how to do that.I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. This movie was way more funny than I expected and I was also more entertained than I expected. This is due to the good script. The scenes where the guys were interacting with one another were just silly and fun. You can really see the chemistry that the actors have seeing that it is the second movie they have done together. The film's new additions all fit in nicely in a supporting role and didn't take away from the main plot. It took a while before we got any real dancing but when we did, it was very aerobic, energetic, and most importantly erotic. I personally thought that there should have been more dancing all around but the dancing we got was well shot and well done choreography-wise. I saw some things that I have never seen before. Sure it was a little too long, sure they could have done without a few parts that I will not mention. I can understand why they took that path since parading good looking people on screen will garner the attention of the ladies who are really whom this movie caters to. Oh the women in this movie, it hurt me on a personal level to see so much money rained on all the strippers shown in the movie. I hope the money being used wasn't real because I just kept imagining what I could have done with all that money. Overall, this movie is not as bad as some people are making it out to be but I can understand why people will stay away from this one.

I also liked the first Magic Mike movie for what it was - very lightweight entertainment, some hot male bodies, a bit of humour, a bit of a plot line and some great dancing.This sequel is just grubby, and, well boring. The dancing is minimal. Most of the 'performances' at the end aren't dancing at all. The Andy McDowell house scenes went on and on ... and on, with absolutely no plot purpose and no dancing, so what was the point? And the scenes with the women 'clients' at the Jade Pickett Smith establishment are pretty demeaning to the women. The bumping and grinding on fat women in the movie is clearly meant to show what great 'performers' these strippers are, able to fake it with any desperate female. I'm absolutely no prude, but it all became pretty sickening in the end, and I was just BORED with the whole thing really. Channing, it's time to move on, mate.",Magic Mike XXL
53,supatube,A slow road-trip-dance-competition-brothel film.,3,30 June 2015,"Mike is persuaded by his past twerking buddies to take a road trip to a stripper's convention. He has been out of the game for three years now. They have an accident and meet up with Mike's ex. Yeah, that sounds about right. There's a whole lot of talking about a whole bunch of nothing. And even if I may not be the intended target audience, it really took like forty minutes before the film even gets to the goods. Those boys don't dance around for a good while and still then, the best dancing doesn't even come from the mates on the road trip. Channing Tatum can move but the other guys are dead weight.Gregory Jacobs was the first assistant director on the first ""Magic Mike"". He has, however, been the first AD on a few of Steven Soderbergh's films. Now they decide to both produce a sequel where Jacobs can take the director's chair and Soderbergh will make some real poor decisions with lighting, composition and editing. The film is so badly lit that so much of it is in darkness. And when it is lit then it's odd. Highlighting weird features. Felt like a student film.The characters are hardly admirable characters, perhaps they're not meant to be. But then they sit around and talk about the difficulties of being so beautiful, how it holds them back and how connections are so difficult. It's a little juvenile, self indulgent and boring. Then the film tries reaching for that two-hour mark to really test the idea of patience. But the characters: you have the tall Greek god type with the monster junk that no woman can handle. Then there's the aged guy who looks like a run down version of Mickey Rourke in ""The Wrestler"". He cant act and is bile-bubbling watching him strip down to a tiny G-string. This ken doll retard that actually just comes off a little weak and whiny. And the Latino guy because that shows diversity. Apparently.The obstacles? They each have to come to terms with being ripped and beautiful (except the wrestler, he needs to come to terms with being really old). Other than that I don't really see any obstacles. Okay, for the good stuff. There are two-dance scenes that are really impressive. The choreography is impeccable. The first is in a secret strip club where Mike is challenged and laps up flipping and twisting women around as he bangs them, rhythmically. And the last dance where Mike and a new guy pull of an impressive reflective dance routine with two women on chairs. Channing Tatum won't come off looking unskilled in this little drama. Jada Pinkett Smith is quite sassy as the stripping MC. And the soundtrack is pretty great. Other than thatI want to say that this one is really for the ladies but I feel the ladies might even be disappointed with the amount of fun to be had in a film that appears to have been more fun to make. There's ten minutes of worthy entertainment but another hundred and five minutes that you have to sift through. ""Magic Mike XXL"" is a weird mash up of a road-trip-dance- comp-brothel film that's just boring.Ill give it some points for the dancing sequences.If you agree check out keepingitreel.info. if not, come cuss me out.",Magic Mike XXL
54,starbase202,Mike should have taken a less 'higher' road,6,16 July 2015,"Well, three other male friends and I saw the movie last weekend. And only about 7 women were also in attendance in the theater - granted it was a Saturday matinée. I must agree with what the lady Washington Post reviewer stated: in effect the movie addressed what fantasies women want in real life. That rarely is done in any movie. However, I did not like the use of drugs by the guys and Mike to celebrate their journey - that sent the very wrong message to our young persons. Also, the private club and stripper convention sequences should have been in better taste - why do American movies usually go for the very lowest common dominator?",Magic Mike XXL

Aging strippers head out on a road trip of sorts to prove they till have what it takes. Just bogus and predictable all the way around. Compounded with Smith's role as a woman named Rome (really? Rome?) who owns a strip joint and is like nails on a chalk board.There a couple of men of color but other wise it's white bread all the way and mostly aging white bread at that. Stripping is a young man's game. Most of these guys are headed to 40 and middle age.They all look as if they took a dip in a pool filled with hair remover. Manganiello's trademark gray hair and salt and pepper beard have magically disappeared to make him look younger.All the stars do double duty in their parts and as part of a coast to coast marketing machine designed to fill the seats and the producers pockets. They all agree that rehearsing and performing in thongs was a true bro boding experience and make fun of their junk and blah blah blah.Save your money.",Magic Mike XXL
56,carly_hope,A Movie for Women,10,23 July 2015,"This was such a lovely, fun and feminist movie. Its main objective was to bring a smile to woman's face and make her feel appreciated and worshiped. And the movie managed it. For the Kings of Tampa, more than the last ride, this was a way to escape their mold and create their own path. To face their dreams outside of the stage. It was really great to get to know the characters more and to see their friendship. It is clear the boys spent some time not only in the gym but also in a dance studio in preparation for this movie. And it was appreciated. A lot :)I love how this movie concentrated more on showing the stripping is for the woman. And while I don't think I would feel comfortable in those situations, it was clear the women enjoyed being cherished and it was also wonderful to see so many different women and different ways appreciation can be shown. I also liked the character of Rome and Jada did a wonderful job with her. She was all about the women. This is a movie for women in a way that very few movies are. And that is why women should go to see it. For pleasure. And men should go see it as well. For education.",Magic Mike XXL
57,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Magic Mike XXL Step Up for Adults,7,1 July 2015,My Thoughts:I really had no expectations when I went into this screening. I had screened Magic Mike when it first came out and wasn't really impressed with that movie. So when the credits started to roll for Magic Mike XXL I was surprised to find myself pleasantly entertained. I would go and put myself out there and say that the sequel is better than the original.The whole premise for the movie is pretty much a Male Entertainer road trip to Myrtle Beach for one last bang before they retire and move onto other things. Along the way the boys stop in Tampa to hang out with Mike who decides to join the boys as they head north.I will say the ladies will not be disappointed in this movie one bit for the eye candy that they will receive. Though I will have to say that no one goes full monty in this movie there is still plenty for ladies eyes to devour. I will say for the men that they do add more ladies in this movie but we do not get the types of views that we received in the first one but it is still very enjoyable for all to see.And my god the cameos. Like I said in my previous review ( Ted 2) this is the summer of cameos and if used well cameos can be a good thing in a movie. And I have to say there is one cameo in particular that once I realized who it was and what he was doing I was totally amazed by his moves.And then of course you have everyone's favorite dancer tWitch who has seemingly been on everything. While watching this movie and seeing both tWitch and Channing Tatum on the screen doing there thing I was like this is the adult version of Step Up. I don't care if you are male or female that last dance scene if you aren't enjoying yourself (not that way) while watching it than you have an issue. My Recommendation:This is an enjoyable movie with eye candy for both sexes and you will be entertained. If nothing else take your girlfriend/wife to see this movie and I am sure you will be much appreciated.,Magic Mike XXL
58,BeccaGudd,Nothing magic about this film!,5,25 August 2017,"I watched Magic Mike XXL tonight. What a waste of time! I do like Channing Tatum but in this film he was lacking well everything. He stumbles through the film, always wearing the same backward cap. Apart from the dancing scenes, the film is very mundane. I was fast forwarding through most of it. I also didn't like the choice of actors like Kevin Nash and Amber Heard, in my opinion they can't act! Some of the music was good but overall boring.",Magic Mike XXL
59,coxpnw,Um ya where is Magic Mike??,5,30 April 2016,"The first Magic Mike I watched in our movie room with my girlfriends. I think we all were completely in awe and more than turned on with the first movie. It was more than hot, exciting and definitely what us women wanted and have been waiting for all this time. There was an actual plot in this movie unlike what we assumed there would be none. I really enjoyed the movie, the men, the plot and movie was great. Now this movie have completely lost everything. I actually tried watching it several times, the first and second time I really fell asleep which should absolutely never happen with Magic Mike. Basically the last ten minutes is the only time you see Magic Mike or Channing dancing and taking it off. Hello isn't that why we are watching this movie? Ya not impressed.",Magic Mike XXL
60,TRussellMorris,Extra Extra Small,2,27 June 2021,"Not much to say as there's not much in it, half the nudity if that, forgettable generic radio hip hop soundtrack. 30% of the story of the original. Quite boring in a lot of places. I guess it was suppose to be a sort of road trip movie, which failed to go anywhere. The dance sequences were quite boring and tame. I think they did manage to strip beyond a swimsuit down to a thong about 40% of the time. All in all a very poor comparison to the original. Although I found a few scenes, such as the drag bar, funny and smile worthy. It was just not a good film at all, and had so little of the sex appeal of the original that I was pretty shocked. I figured with the success of the first, they would step it UP, instead they actually tamed it down. Overall not much worth a real watch, maybe just fast forward to the decent sequences = skipping 60% of the movie, something most did not find themselves doing in the original.",Magic Mike XXL
61,jlj9675-1,silly waste of time,1,1 July 2015,"Decided to forgo the R rating and inevitable sickening language in order to enjoy some eye candy doing amazing dancing. Wrong, as we had about 5 minutes of dancing. The rest of the film was just silly, inane filth. It's hard to imagine such debauchery actually exists in the world. I am ashamed of everyone who participated in this disgusting project, including myself for contributing to its revenue. I read somewhere that Channing was dismayed to have to work out in prep for his request to do it again (I didn't see the first one) but it turns out HE was the producer. I guess the almighty dollar won out over good taste. I'm so disappointed in Andie McDowell, Jada Pinkett Smith and Michael Strahan that they lowered themselves to this sickening nastiness and will find it hard to view any future projects of theirs. I wonder how they justify this to their children?",Magic Mike XXL
62,doofuspoofus,"Pitch Perfect 2 again, pointless remakes",6,16 July 2015,Well I'll start by saying I know these are movies about male stripping but I still take them seriously as films. So the first movie had way more stripping which is a common complaint about XXL by most women because you'd think the sequel would have more. However I think the reason is because the first movie was solely about the life of a stripper but XXL is more of an unexpected bro. road trip movie leading up to a stripper convention. The first Magic Mike however had more of a dark direction making it more dramatic and less fun whereas XXL is more vibrant and less dramatic. The main thing lacking from the first film was Amber Heard. The actress in the first film just had no presence on screen and showed no personality whereas Amber Heard is sort of your go to hot blonde perfect for playing these types of characters. I think the fact that there was no sex scene between Amber Heard and Channing or at least some sort of kissing was a waste. Their flirtatious relationship much like the film was lacking something more. I feel it was very much an unnecessary sequel but I can't say I wasn't entertained. It was hilarious and full of hot dudes but the raw and real edginess the first film had is gone. Reminds me of Pitch Perfect 2; one big letdown.,Magic Mike XXL

You have to see Michael Stratem's one scene to believe it - it comprises (spoiler alert) him ""dancing"" with a very large sized black woman. She's on a table & he does weird things with her. I would take this movie off his resume if I were him. Also witness the rock bottom of Andie McDowell's career. She has no place to go but up. Tatum Channing is in the third stage of a typical Hollywood career. It goes like this: 1.) Who's Canning Tatum? 2.) Get me Channing Tatum 3.) Get me a young Channing Tatum & finally 4.) Who is Channing Tatum. The worst part of this movie is the lack of a good script.",Magic Mike XXL
65,Baghdaddy,Condiments! What An Awful Idea!,8,3 July 2015,"This film was a lot better than the prequel, in my opinion!So the film starts off following Magic Mike (Tatum) as he tries to lead a normal life...then he gets a call explaining one of his former dance colleagues has passed away. As he attends the so called 'wake', he realizes it is a lie, and that his friends just wanted to lure him to meet up with them. Why? One final show, together!From then on, its just non-stop dancing and flirting! OK, so I'm a guy, and I'll admit it is a film geared towards girls. With a film like this, I did not go in expecting a convincing story line & to be frank, there wasn't really one present. Other downers include a pretty poor ending, and in my opinion Kevin Nash's character was just useless & looked misplaced!But why did I rate it so highly then? Firstly, Tatum is such an excellent dancer it is unreal! It takes real talent to be able to pull of such dance moves. The choice of music was pretty excellent too, and his co-stars were pretty decent dancers too! Finally, there was quite a fair bit of comedy present!So in conclusion, I can see why guys would hate this film, however, the dance sequences are great & let's be honest, many guys would trade quite a bit to be able to dance like these guys!",Magic Mike XXL

In stead of him you mention a row of unimportant female actors that don't play a role of any importance. Some of them look so alike, that it is confusing which caracter you are dealing with.

67,shorty6_1_90,Surprised at the negative reviews,8,29 July 2015,"I thought this movie was great. I mean you have to remember to take it for what it is a break from reality. This film focuses on the bond between the ""colleagues"" not really sure what to call them but it focuses on the problems within their friendships and more on their back stories. I feel the movie does fine without Matthew McConaughey, and benefits from the removal of the characters ""The Kid"" and Brooke. I enjoyed the addition of Zoe and her friends. I found that Jada Pinkett's scenes added nothing to the movie left me feeling that her character was pointless. I laughed so hard I'm talking tears streaming stomach cramping laughter for a good portion of the movie it was very enjoyable. I actually prefer the sequel to the original. I feel part of what makes this movie so good is that unlike The Hangover 2 they strayed away from the original plot.",Magic Mike XXL

Last time was JumpStreet. He is a volcano of talents and he was playing with his heart in it as he was coaching other fellows in the movie! Great job Tatum! Good for you :) I think regardless of your profession and any sort of cliché you follow, this is a sort of movie you should watch once in a while at least to sit back and relax even by yourself! Overall, I found it full of passion and very well done job in singing, dancing ... I may go into mood of watching it again with someone who might appreciate the art of dance and music beyond borders.

69,AlainAKoningverdraag,Very Entertaining,8,16 July 2015,"The first one had some cool dance routines. But then there was the excruciatingly boring and dud ""girlfriend""... I mean, when you looked her... in a strip movie - that's supposed to be filled with attractive, beautiful, lively girls & women. I went like wha...????! At least part two entertaining - to the end. And I mean from start to finish. So glad that absolutely boring girl has been scrapped; she really did the first one a disservice. She radiated ...boredom. Lifelessness.Anyway, In this one, we have Amber Heard. Yes, she's skinny as hell; but at least she is nice to look at. She radiates something interesting. Much better choice.The movie? Heh, it's not an Oscar winner, but it sure was fun to watch. Really, I've been a stripper myself; and got nice flashbacks - all throughout, especially the shows they were doing at the stripper convention. Obviously, all the guys had a great time and every girl I spoke to thought the movie ended a bit quick. But none of them had anything bad to say about it. The theater was filled with mostly girls & women anyway. I counted a couple of gay guys and the odd guy with his girlfriend/wife; even they enjoyed it.Don't be a macho dick. Go see the movie.

A good movie.",Magic Mike XXL
72,mkenyon1978,Pretty good 2nd effort,8,2 July 2015,"I loved Magic Mike. I enjoyed XXL as well, but it just isn't as good as the original, mostly because of the complete lack of a cohesive storyline. I liked that all the main guys got their own back-stories in this movie, but I think that that, combined with the absence of a over-arching story, gave an overall disjointed effect. I was left with the feeling of having binge-watched a bunch of ""Magic Mike the series"" episodes, which is not un-enjoyable, but it does not make it a movie. However, there were lots of killer moves, the guys were all fabulous and there was tons of eye candy to enjoy. I loved the ""Queen"" angle and thought that Jada Pinkett Smith was perfect in her role. I thought Elizabeth Banks' small roll was wonderful as well, but I wasn't a huge fan of Angie MacDowell's character and felt that her storyline was forced and weird (although the Richie bit at the end was hilarious!).",Magic Mike XXL

The dance performances look fantastic as expected and the dancers are very skilled. However, I find that some of the strippers' routines seemed to treat the women in the movie rather roughly. For example, Amber Heard's Zoe was the ""prop"" of Magic Mike's very aggressive dance number. It made me cringe every time I saw her getting thrown and flipped around in awkward positions because it made the choreography look good. Or the poor women in the scene at Rome's private house that are used as props for Mike's other complicated dance routine. It makes the male dancers look awfully oblivious to the needs of their audience. The screenwriters and producers should take a cue from Japan's ""host"" industry, where good-looking men acting as companions to women work hard to understand their clients' emotional needs. Don't put the dance moves before the woman!",Magic Mike XXL
75,storm_mica,Okay if you ignore the hype,7,25 October 2015,"Magic Mike XXL was my first Magic Mike experience and I have to say it wasn't so bad; certainly not as bad as some reviews suggest here. Classy and slick it is not but hey! what were you expecting? they're male strippers, right? This movie is made to appeal to suburban women and gay men everywhere and it doesn't limp far beyond the beefcake factor but my question is: why should it? What we have here is a classic road trip movie with some implied sex, drugs and various other vices along the way. And of course, like most road movies, the obligatory performances along the way followed by the grand finale at (in this instance) the strippers conference.This shows, of course, a complete lack of imagination but it doesn't really seem to matter.. If you are a prude you won't like it and I'm guessing that's why there are so many negative reviews here.6/10 with an extra point for the sling/9 inch nails routine... yaaaaaaahhhh..",Magic Mike XXL
76,fthurston-29424,Better then the first.,9,30 August 2015,"OK so if you watch this film for nothing but the stripping, a little advice... skip through to towards the end of the film as there is none until then. But you know what? That's actually OK.So I'll admit I watched the first film for the stripping and walked away loving the plot and realizing that a film still can take me from one place to another by it's conclusion.So I commenced this film for the sake of seeing what would happen in the sequel. Yeah I wont lie, the chance to see Channing Tatum get his groove on and strip down to as little as possible was part of the appeal, but I truly wanted to see where Mike would end up after deciding to step away from stripping and open up his own custom made furniture business.So we do open up seeing exactly that. Mike has a business up and running with just one employee, but still he's indulging in his passion. We come to find out that things didn't work out with Brooke and he is, sadly, single again. But rather than let that get him down for the entire film (which believe me, so many films will do) Mike actually seems to be doing OK.One day one of the guys from the old Kings of Tamper calls him to tell him that Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) has died! So Mike goes to visit them thinking he's going for a wake. Turns out Dallas only left the group and ran off with 'the kid'. Mike seems to revel in being back with his old buddies though and goes home that night and (after turning on some music) proceeds to dance (stripper style) while working. As passionately as you can imagine, part way through his work he tosses everything aside and dances for the fun of it, smiling at the conclusion of the song.So not surprisingly he decides to join the old Kings of Tamper for a one last hurrah! They take a road trip down to the destination their headed where they will be part of a convention for strippers.The film just glows from start to end with many fun scenes along the way and not really any moments of sadness at all. Andie MacDowell stars in an awesome scene where (in her home) she has a few women over drinking and the men arrive. Everyone gets to drinking and lets just say its a lot of fun and a whole lotta laughs!Jada Pinkett Smith also stars as the awesome Rome (wont say more here, you gotta watch)And it all culminates in the final climatic strip show that you await as eagerly as you do Harold and Kumar making it to white castle. The only difference in this film is you enjoy every moment of the journey and don't really mind if they take their time, many detours, or even if they would happen to be a month late you're having that much fun!The final strip scenes are good, however not as good as the first one Ill admit. But you do see Channings (behind) and another guys. Otherwise it's mainly stripping to above the waste action.But as I said, the stripping was always a small part for me and I loved every moment of it.Gregory Jacobs... I score you a 9/10! (Which for me this week is quite generous- I've been throwing out 1's and 2's!) The only reason it's not a 10 is because the stripping was better last time. Otherwise a perfect movie and Jacobs ultimately achieves what any director wants to, by allowing us to loose ourselves and leave our lives behind (for just under two hours) and get lost in the *magic* that is Mike XXL- Well Done :)",Magic Mike XXL
77,wainscoat-1,XXL is XX Lame,1,12 July 2015,"I totally loved the first Magic Mike and the first 5 minutes of XXL looked good too. But after those first 5 minutes....XXL suddenly turned into one long improv show - The sort of improv done by people with fabulous bodies and no sense of humor whatsoever - The sort of improv where audience members shout out topics like ""Frozen Yogurt"" or ""A boring person sits next to you on a bus and just won't shut up."" After a while I felt sorry for the actors who seemed to try so hard to come up with something, anything, to say, while growing more and more resentful as in ""Hey - we're strippers, not writers. Do we have to do everything?"" And the dancing this time? Yuck. I even felt sorry for the female audience members in the dance sequences. Imagine that you are just out for a fun bachelorette party, when you suddenly find yourself thrust 6 feet in the air with your ""bachelorette parts"" strapped across some strange guy's face and then the guy starts doing somersaults and cartwheels. Ouch.I left about 3/4ths of the way through. It was just all too sad.",Magic Mike XXL
78,YoungCriticMovies,No More Magic: A Film Which Throws the Script Out the Window and Lacks Cast Dedication,6,20 July 2015,"Magic Mike XXL, the sequel to the much-lauded Magic Mike is exactly what you were expecting the first film to be. When Magic Mike came out in 2012, many were surprised by how director Steven Soderbergh was able to humanize and bring tension and emotion to a story about male strippers. However, with Soderbergh not directing the second film, the story turned into an audience-pleasing film that prioritized abs over the script quality.Magic Mike XXL picks up with Mike (Channing Tatum) having finally started his own furniture building company (a dream he was working towards in the first film). The company is miniscule; so much that Mike has only one employee whom he can barely pay. But given the circumstances, Mike is happy, this was what he had always wanted. However, we see in brief flashes that Mike does miss doing his ""magic"" and dancing on ""the stage."" During a particularly impressive scene Channing Tatum dances to ""Pony"" in his wood shed, sliding and spinning around tools and planks erotically. Coincidently during a surprise reunion with his aging stripper ex-coworkers he is convinced to go to the Myrtle Beach stripper convention and dance with the boys one last time.The film's script is not worth analyzing, the director: Gregory Jacobs clearly wanted to focus more on physical comedy and dancing than anything else; unfortunately this makes the non-dancing scenes completely eternal and pointless. Regrettably, there are very few dancing scenes as well; besides the woodshed there is also a gas station dance that had everyone cracking up as Joe Manganiello's character tries to make a cashier smile on a bet, and then there is the stripper finale. There really is one good non-dancing scene which takes place at Andie MacDowel's character's house, but that's mainly because of the good acting from MacDowel (yes I was surprised she was in this film as well), Matt Bomer, Amber Heard, and Channing Tatum.The cast does seem extremely uncomfortable throughout the whole movie; even Channing Tatum wasn't really giving it his all, and it felt as though director Jacobs hadn't had a strict hand with his actors. Also many actors felt lost, I for one suffered as Matt Bomer struggled to make his character's actions seem rational and as he tried to dance. The only actor who was giving it full passion and felt like he was having the time of his life was Joe Manganiello, and it's unfortunate that his time to shine was in such a blunt movie. The cast had the female supporting additions of Jada Pinkett Smith, who was overused and a scene in her house dragged far too long, the surprising and afore mentioned Andie MacDowel (underused, but stealing the show when she was given the chance) and Amber Heard (had 2 minutes where she showed some spark).So in the end Magic Mike XXL ended up being what us cinema critics were hoping it wouldn't be. Disappointment? Yes. Entertainment? A little. Abs? A lot.",Magic Mike XXL
79,LolaVavoom,"Finally, the Magic!",10,30 April 2016,"This film was perfect - sexy, silly, fun, cheesy, ridiculous, dancing, singing and focus on female pleasure. Yes, please - I'd gladly have some more! I can't believe I've only seen it now and it totally made my day - I remember trying to get a girls' party together to go to the cinema at the time but we could't quite manage - a pity. I would have loved to see it on a big screen surrounded by excited audience.This is the Magic Mike that I wanted - the first one was great as far as Channing Tatum's story was concerned however that ""poor little spoilt boy"" addition was quite unfortunate, unnecessary and unconvincing. I just didn't buy it. The love interest could have been a little more attractive as well. Well, never mind that now the good stuff arrived!Here we have everything: sight of fit naked backside in the first 3 minutes, a prank, Channing's wet-suit Mr Darcy moment, cheesy banter, ""My Pony"" solo and that's just the start. Fun all the way and focus on the right things: friendship, doing what you like and are good at, working at being a good performer, having fun and giving women what they want.Some moments are so cheesy that I laughed out loud - but it's meant to be a bit ridiculous and not taking itself seriously.I loved every minute of it. Even over-the-top faux romantic singing. Channing - yes. Yes. The best in hot and exciting dancing ever, hands down. He moves like he was born to dance - like he loves it. Poetry in motion, need I say more! I actually loved that there was no actual sex in this film - it reminds me of some of those teasing sex-bomb comedies from the 50s where women are portrayed as over-the-top sexy, cheesy and silly - only here we have a gender reversal. Perfect male-cheesecake film and oh so pleasing.",Magic Mike XXL
80,ckd-42924,I like MAGIC MIKE,8,20 October 2015,"I love the first movie, MAGIC MIKE. I think the first one focuses on more personality of characters, and the balance of story and dance scenes is good. On the other hand, MMXXL is more like ""entertainment"". It is funny. It was a shame that I couldn't see Matthew McConaughey.Their performances are really cool and also funny. The scene in a convenience store is one of my favorite scene. Of course, Channing Tatum in the last dance show is really cool.I really enjoyed this movie, and I like this movie. I think you can enjoy this movie if you haven't seen the first one. I want to see this movie again on screen.",Magic Mike XXL
81,bunsen2019,Well done gentlemen,8,5 July 2015,"If only there were an Oscar for hotness. Kudos to channing, joe, matt, adam and kevin (not to forget Michael strahan, dashuan and crew). Respect to the actors for working out so hard to achieve such perfect bodies! Joe and Channing were standout dancers. Straight up talent. Matt Bomer surprised with an incredible singing voice. It is amazing fun to watch these performances. The female characters were kind of duds. Could do without psychoanalyzing the one dimensional women (got a bit embarrassing at points esp the scene with Andie mcdowell and her wino middle aged desperate lady friends-gay husband, crying b/c i don't feel attractive ugh stereotype much). Guess what, women just enjoy the show, not because they have low self esteem or need someone to make them feel beautiful. It's just fun to watch hot guys dance!",Magic Mike XXL
82,bebebets,Hot Hot Hot,9,30 June 2015,"Wow, Channing Tatum was So Hot, I can't even... The entire cast was great! Kind of missed Mathew McConaughey in the beginning, but I was drawn in by the hot guys, so after a bit I forgot all about him. Some very nice surprises, Twitch, from ""So you think you can dance"", whoa, I knew he could dance, but whoa, who knew he could be so sexy at it. Jada Pinkett Smith was brilliant as the MC. She was inspiring to watch, a true pro. Who knew that Matt Bomer could sing like that, and to do it live and still move so sexy, well that was just delish. Even the guy who looks like Mickey Rourke in ""The wrestler"" was endearing. Joe Manganiello is one hot papi, even threw in a little ""fifty shades"" in there for us. The tasty treat Latino made me blush. Would have liked to hear more funnies from Gabriel Iglesias, he is a really funny guy but he was mostly absent, maybe his schedule didn't allow it, but that's why I gave it a 9. The real show stopper was the last dance with Twitch & Channing, Wow, Wow, Wow. Sexy doesn't even come close to describing it, OMG... you just have to see it, that's all I'll say. The scenes in the mansion were some of my favorite. Andy McDowell was a pro as always and such a joy to watch. What a relatable character, I hope to have her happy ending one day after a failed miserable marriage, to end up with a hot sexy as hell man who knows I'm the ""one"". I left the theater breathless and smiling from ear to ear, as did all the women there. It delivered, it had everything I wanted and then some, Wow is my final statement, Wow.",Magic Mike XXL
83,hamidnoori03,Simply not good..,3,30 December 2015,"The movie starts off good, but as we move forward unmeaningful scenes come up that ruin the little moments that were actually good and entertaining. The dancing is amazing there is not question about that, but the movie has no objective or meaning or message or anything which tells me that the movie is only made for means of money and nothing else. I think the only people who should watch this movie is the people who want to be professional strippers and don't know the professional moves to become one. Even the die hard Tatum fans or woman who want to see some nice muscular bodies of male strippers should not watch this movie because Tatum does not put up a great performance other than the dancing and we don't see a lot of strip dancing anyways. The point is this movie is not fun at all and does not entertain you unless you want it to. In my opinion a waste of time an unwatchable.",Magic Mike XXL
84,kathystrickland,NO!,2,12 October 2019,"VERY few times I have not been happy/excited to watch good looking scantily clad men. This is one of those times, like the first Magic Mike. Tatum seems to believe he has moves, but he is WRONG! No effort seems to have been made preparing for these parts. Sheldon, Howard and Leonard have more sex appeal than these guys.",Magic Mike XXL
85,WadoodS,Lacklustre Mike!,3,14 October 2015,"Channing Tatum is a retired male dancer/stripper who's been away from it for three years. After his marriage proposal to his girlfriend goes wrong he decides to join his old buddies in the male entertainment group. They go for a last ride to the male strippers' convention in New York. On their way, they come to the house of the girls they meet in the beach some days ago and all they do there is talk about their sex life... Ugh!!!The movie lacks the charm of Matthew MacConauhey but they took care of including black male strippers. The makers of the movie try to solve it by creating a scene where the band MC is injured and Channing stops by a country club for black people full of women, they find their a new MC there. Only at the end there is some little mike entertainment for the fans of the first movie. I personally believe that the male entertainment at the end were too much and they all went almost full nude, doing different sex positions on the selected audience.I wasn't very much entertained, maybe the movie was not for me. Also there were too much nonsense talk in the movie which made it boring for me. 3/10",Magic Mike XXL
86,raz-boy,A very entertaining movie for girls and guys!,7,5 July 2015,"Never in a million years would I imagine to end up enjoying a movie about male strippers. Both, the first ""Magic Mike"" and ""Magic Mike XXL"" proved me wrong. I loved watching this movie! Like the first one this film is not simply showing a bunch of naked dudes dancing on the screen, it is more of an adventure film. ""Magic Mike XXL"" has a very simple, yet very entertaining plot. Even though the movie was over two hours long, it didn't feel too stretched out to me. I kept wanting to watch more and see what this group of guys are going to do next. The tone of the film is perfect. It is not taking itself too seriously, yet I would not call this movie a pure comedy. There are, although, a bunch of moments in the film that made me laugh out loud really hard. Channing is great, but Joe Manganiello was the best for me; he is absolutely hysterical. I am not a fan of male striptease, but for some reason I really enjoyed the actual performance scenes too. The performances are not what you would typically imagine; they are very original and well rehearsed.Overall a very fun and entertaining movie, regardless if you are a guy or a girl.",Magic Mike XXL
87,line-schulz,Better entertainment then the first one,8,12 July 2015,"I'm not crazy good at this, but I'd like to tell my opinion about this movie. I remember seeing the first one - huge disappointment - so my expectations for this movie wasn't high. But I was very entertained (I am a 21 year-old girl, so yes I was entertained). But this movie actually had a plot. And it was funny seeing these 30+ year old guys having the time of their life. It was their last change, and I though it was hilarious, but at the same time it was actually worth watching. It's a winner for a girls night, because let's face it; it's full of gorgeous men, who knows how to rock your world, but it's funny at the same time. I really enjoyed it, even though I had to look away sometimes :-)",Magic Mike XXL
88,AnonymousMovieCritic,I'm Embarrassed for the Actors,1,27 February 2016,"This film was so lame, badly written and just plain awful, I'm embarrassed for the poor actors. It's just sad to see such fine actors like Tatum and Manganiello reduced to having to take roles like this.Now you could probably let the bad ""story"" and dialogue slide if you got to see a lot of eye candy, but no. The film is supposed to be about hot male strippers---but we rarely see any of them naked (well, in a thong, close enough)! And when we do, the lighting is so dingy, the audience would have to wear night vision goggles to make out anything. The director also miscast a huge, ugly oaf as one of the strippers. Unbelievable. We want to see prime filet naked, not Shrek! What we do see a lot of---instead of hot naked guys---are the guys fully clothed blabbering about B.S.NOTE to future directors of male stripper movies: we want to see the hot actors naked. A. Lot. In good lighting. Thank you.",Magic Mike XXL
89,HeliosZg,"Slightly better, than those porn movies with an actual script.",4,6 July 2015,"The only reason why I didn't give this movie an even lower score was Joe Manganiello. Just bad and cheesy. It's literally like the perfect porn substitute for those overly religious ladies who are now able to go to the cinema and watch shirtless men, without feeling as guilty, as they would, if they watched porn instead. And the whole cinema was literally filled with them lol. Haven't watched the first one btw and I don't think I will. As far as I've noticed, at the start, the movie does some pretty random cuts with some characters from the first movie. What happened to Channing's girlfriend from the first movie that I'm sure he had to win over with a lot of effort? The info was pretty vague and confusing. Some scenes also make this look like a low budget erotic movie, like when only the main characters are in focus and everything around them is literally visibly blurry as hell. The story is just a ridiculous excuse for some (okay made) stripper performances. The acting was cheesy, like the characters didn't even take it seriously. The Ken character is obviously gay, just like the actor, I was waiting for him to jump on one of the male characters, the way he was watching them. :DDD The story about Joe's oversized penis and him not being able to find a woman that can take it... seriously? The random scene at the drag club? Still don't understand why they included it, it's just random. These older guys going to this convention for the last time? Cheesy... And Channing's character winning over that girl, while he's still not done with his old gf? Errr... The whole script in my opinion is just bad and random and not that logical. The only reason these movies are a hit in my opinion are the cock deprived women who go and watch them (sorry, ladies, I saw you all giggling like you hadn't seen a shirtless body for ages and I just rolled my eyes throughout the whole movie). What's worse, I don't even find these guys particularly sexy. And no chest hair! And no Asians lol! The ending with them watching some fireworks... again, random, what made those fireworks so exciting? We never get to see it. It's like a bad QAF episode ending with cheesy music. The only good thing about this movie was in my opinion Joe Manganiello's performance in the store and at the convention, fun, exciting and sexy! :D He really looks like a Greek god and his grins made it even more fun, while the others' just seemed cheesy. I dunno what to say, in my opinion, a mess of a movie.",Magic Mike XXL
90,btbullet-1,Way better than 6.2!,8,5 July 2015,"IMDb raters really panned this. I thought the story was hilarious. The convenience store scene alone put this movie over the top. Now, maybe the average male thought this one crap, what average hetero woman actually likes the storyline and content of male risqué theater? Zero? I give this one an eight. Women don't have enough fun... And freedom... In this area.All of the main characters probably worked their brains out to condition for this, and learn the challenging choreography. None of this is appreciated in any of the other reviews. bravo guys!IMDb's minimum text line requirement is awful. I am done. IMDb's minimum text line requirement is awful. I am done.

91,charlestontracy,Loads of Fun!!!,9,4 July 2015,"I give this movie a solid 8. While parts did tend to be slow and drawn out and were not necessary the end totally makes up for it! The first Magic Mike was an excellent movie, however it was a little dark and showed probably a more realistic side to the stripping world. The second Magic Mike is way more fun, comical, and entertaining. I don't go and see movies that are only going to be nominated for Oscars. I knew this wasn't going to be award worthy, but it sure was super fun! I love the bond between the guys in this one and the road trip aspect. Amber Heard kind of ruined it for me a little no offense. She's beautiful but her character did absolutely nothing for the film. There were a few scenes where I got some great laughs. One being the super market scene, and the other being the Twilight stripper scene. OMG! I almost died. And when they did Molly, even though I don't promote drug use, still a funny scene. So get your girls together for a fun night out. This movie is super fun and the last 20 minutes is going to be a blast!",Magic Mike XXL
92,sukhmanjitcheema,Back with some more magic.,10,30 June 2015,"In the 2012 blockbuster, Magic Mike, In which Channing Tatum was cemented as an actor and put into the hearts of wild young ladies. But, since the director of the first film, Steven Sodenbergh is gone (although he is the director of photography), can the new director, Gregory Jacobs make some (good) magic again? Well, boy you better buckle up your seatbelt, because XXL is a hell of a ride! First of all, the flashy music and flashy camera takes help the gloomy atmosphere shine. Some of the cast members return, but it was sad to see Matthew McConaughey go away, and The Kid doesn't make a return. But Jada Pinkett Smith neatly fills Dallas' shoes (and adds heels to them). The music is the star here, be sure to catch the film in theaters, because the sound is bang on with bass loud and clear in your face, it is probably better than the sounds in Pitch Perfect 2. And that's saying something. Jacobs slowly crafts Magic Mike into a saga, a legacy, something more than a soft core male stripping porn movie. XXL is a hell of a good time, it's not awkward (for me and the men) and regardless of your gender, enjoy this incredibly fun movie.",Magic Mike XXL
93,smoriol,Darn Good Road Trip Film,10,25 July 2015,Magic Mike XXL is a darn fine road trip movie. The cast is wonderful and have more opportunities to act in this film. Who'd a thunk it? We get to know the guys from the first film and we really care about them. Add to that we're viewing scads of beautifully sculptured male bodies throughout the film and its win win all the way around!All the bad reviews are so inaccurate and missing the point. This is a feel good movie about male strippers. Or maybe the reviewers are a little too close minded. MM XXL is big Fun with a capital F. A really laugh out loud type of film.The cinematography is beautiful. There are some gorgeous shots of Georgia. The soundtrack is good too. I really enjoyed all the main characters' final routines. The film creators really put some thought behind it and didn't just throw something at us just to make more money. For that I thank them.Well worth the money and the time.,Magic Mike XXL
94,lalumiere,Utter Disappointment -- May Contain Mild Spoilers,2,1 July 2015,"I totally loved the first Magic Mike movie because it was fun and exciting and had that true-to-life sense about it, BUT this one: Magic Mike XXL (2015) just ""blows"" so to speak.The story line was weak and scattered and the ostensibly erotic dancing while agile and acrobatic was rather gross and coarse, the kind of stuff that makes a girl feel itchy and uncomfortable -- this girl anyway.And I don't believe this is a spoiler but what's with this business of all women being queens and all men being kings? Kinda stupid to begin with and overworked in this flick.Also I love Channing Tatum, and have enjoyed every movie I've ever seen him in, but the best scene in this one -- and this may be a spoiler, I guess -- though nothing could spoil this movie more than it spoiled itself -- the best scene in it was with Joe Manganiello at a convenience store.On the way to the theater, I had been telling my husband that what I liked about the first Magic Mike movie was that it was the joyous and fun side of sex and exotic dancing, very, sexy but not overly dirty or pornographic, so I was excited and looking forward to this one, and then we watched it and it was... well, it was a grueling hour and 55 minutes sitting through it...If there was someone I could ask for my money back, I'd do it.I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 for Joe Manganiello's performance and because I love Channing Tatum.Magic Mike XXL not recommended at all. Sorry.",Magic Mike XXL
95,tonedeaftromboner,XXL Failure,2,17 October 2015,"I was actually embarrassed for all the actors involved with this movie. Either there wasn't a script or they just didn't bother learning their lines or rehearsing. Improve just doesn't work with some actors or when there really is no point to the story. Was this supposed to be about 40 year old men who act like 12 year olds who think they're 25? Yes, the guys are in really good shape, but all those great bodies have 40-year old heads attached. Again, how are they not embarrassed by the release of this movie? And Channing Tatum looks ridiculous with that backward baseball cap. Every scene was truncated, so there was no resolution to anything. And, the reason provided for the road trip was petty lame. All in all, a poor attempt to simply capitalize on the mediocre at best original. XXL failure.",Magic Mike XXL
96,emilyms-36094,So so average,4,31 January 2016,"I think i am being generous rating this film 4/10. I watched the first Magic Mike, and thought that was average, but i thought i'd give the 2nd one a go, oh how i regret wasting nearly 2 hours of my dayAgain like the first one, i felt there was such a poor storyline, like it just went no where, and was really poor. I didn't even get the first half hour, because it was just really vague, and i kept thinking 'what is the point in this?'. The dancing was OK, but very similar to the first, there was nothing really different. The only positives i can give from this film is that the music was better than the first, and this helped, because for a time of 30 seconds ish every so often i felt there was a reason for watching this film! And Joe Manganiello, was also another positive of watching this film, he's gorgeous.Other than this, i am really struggling!! If you are not head over heels, or find any of these attractive, i would not at all recommend watching this average film!",Magic Mike XXL

I waited for it so long..I had big plans to watch it with my best friend...and when the time came...OMG was it bad.There where so many talking about feeling that I was sure it was a drama. I wanted to see nice men and dancing..really good dancing. I'm so sorry that I've spend my little time with my BFF watching this instead of talking or just doing something else. Maybe it was my high expectations but I don't think so. The movie was just bad.Oh, and I'm so upset, there where good actors and the plan should have been a done deal. I don't understand what happened. Where did they messed up?",Magic Mike XXL
98,marlee-4,This film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be,2,14 November 2015,"I wanna start this off by saying I did not enjoy the first movie. This was probably due to wrongful marketing. Like many hopeful ladies I was expecting a comedy with playful strip routines and hot men and was served up something sad and serious.For the sequel it was pretty much the same except this film wasn't sad, it was boring. For a film about ""A group of male strippers going to a stripper's convention"" this film has very little stripping in it. In stead it's filled with dialogue that is hard to follow and seems completely unnecessary. The first stripping happens like 40 minutes into the movie and it doesn't get better.If you were hoping for Pitch Perfect with male strippers you will be disappointed. There are no elaborately choreographed synchronized strip performances in this film. They do mostly solo performances where they manhandle their female clients in a way that made me as an audience member very uncomfortable. Overall I'm not sure what the target audience for this film is and I don't think the filmmakers know either, though I'm sorry to say this.",Magic Mike XXL

The acting is horrible. Andie MacDowell is doing a terrible job. I can see why Matthew McConaughey wouldn't want to be in it. Hopefully when it comes time to choose the Razzie nominations, this movie gets a lot of them. I enjoyed Magic Mike. This is a disappointment. Some movies don't need sequels and this is proof of that. Channing Tatum is also doing a horrible job, as are the rest of the other strippers from the original. Hopefully they don't make a third Magic Mike movie.",Magic Mike XXL
101,auntd,The characters from the prequel are back in the saddle for one more ride.,10,27 July 2015,"After reading all the negative reviews, I am appalled. I actually enjoyed this movie over the first for several reasons. The first Magic Mike had too much ""romance"" in it. I wanted to watch handsome men dance, not find love. And I believe with the sequel Magic Mike XXL I got it. I loved the dialog in this also. There were a lot of women, more believable than the teeny boppers from the first, that had sexual awakenings. It was the full female experience. The men made the women feel like queens and I loved every bit of it! The dancing was even better, a lot more moves I've never seen before. As far as their age being almost forty and some were older than forty, so what? They still got it. I prefer to look at sexy men, I have never put a number on it. Besides, it's a movie people. Enjoy it for what it is. Empowering women and teaching the men a few things in the process.",Magic Mike XXL

I hate the beginning, it was so boring with moving furniture and all that. And it's just sad that Mathew McConaughey is not in it this time along with the ""New Kid"". Saddening, I know right? But I guess their bodies weren't as sexified anymore! OH WELL! At least Channing Tatum is in it with his beastly body and smooth sexified moves! When he was in the shop working on something and the song from the first movie comes on, he starts to think about the ""old times"" and he does a few slick moves! And it's sad that his engagement fell through the cracks and she wanted something more. BUT the end! With this heavenly angel he danced with or on, on stage...mmm my dream right there! That was SO sexy!",Magic Mike XXL

The actors are really bad, a bad performance, a bad attitude, a bad feeling, a bad experience for me. Seriously, I was waiting and waiting that's something happening, but never happened.Joe Manganiello is better being Sofia Vergara boyfriend, That's it.Adam Rodriguez please go back to CSI!!!

These men are absolutely sexy and watching them strip and dance is all anyone really wants to see. I loved the special appearance from Donald Glover and Jada. I was a bit weary as to how this would turn out after McConaughey left, but it really didn't matter! Also to whoever said that these male strippers are ""too old"". Well yeah, technically they are all in their late 30s and beyond, but again, who cares? If they look like that at any age, it doesn't matter. Channing Tatum is just amazing, his dance moves and body are pretty much jaw-dropping. The others are great as well. There's really no denying it. This is a perfect girls night out movie! Don't miss the hotness.",Magic Mike XXL
105,Aahamrick,Magic Mike XXL,8,21 July 2015,"You guys have me laughing over these 1 star reviews!! What were you expecting?? Oscar worthy performances? Magic Mike is what it is and it does it VERY well. This movie had every person in the theater laughing and sitting with their mouths open most of the movie. I think the cast was very well chosen and the choreography on most of the dances is crazy good! Jada does a fantastic job as her role as Rome. I thought I would miss Matthew not being in the film but this one turned out better than the first. Now let's be clear... This is a naughty movie so try to not take your mother to see this unless you want an awkward experience! If you are a prude then this also is not the movie for you. I went with a small group of women but I actually recommend you taking your significant other and making him take notes! The music choices in the movie make you want to dance in your seat! Overall, if you like seeing very attractive men dancing in almost nothing then you for sure want to see this but if you're look for a life altering tale that will make you want to write sonnets and wow the critics just go see something else.",Magic Mike XXL
106,davidduranperez,Not as bad as expected,7,3 July 2015,"If you are going to the theater for this movie you have to be aware that you are going to definitely watch a male stripper film.From my point of view, ""Magic Mike XXL"" is more superficial than the first ""Magic Mike"". It focuses too much to male dancing losing part of the deepness that made the first movie a good one to watch. Although I missed Matthew McConaughey, Channing Tatum is really good at this film with great striptease performances. I would say he is better than in the first one. I have also liked the acting of Amber Heard, though his role is not fully developed in the movie. We can also easily see the chemistry among the guys. On the other hand, the songs and the staging are quite powerful.To sum up, you will probably spend a good time watching this film, but in few hours you will forget it.",Magic Mike XXL
107,stephaniedanyelle,Wasn't what I was expecting,8,12 August 2015,"I give this movie an 8 because you doesn't love watching Channing & the rest of the guys dance, but it wasn't what I expected. The first movie at least had a story line, a love story attached. It showed how people can bring themselves up from the bottom to the top no matter what their profession is and of course had the dancing involved to tie together a great show! This movie had a story line, but it wasn't nearly as good as the first one. Yes the dancing was great (when it actually happened) but there wasn't enough of the dancing for as much as it was bragged about. You sat through the entire movie to only get great dancing at the end in the last 5-10 minutes. I just expected a little bit more. Not asking for a full on porno by all means, but just stating that for the amount that it was bragged about for being so ""XL"" it wasn't anything over the top.",Magic Mike XXL

Dealing with past issues, uncertainty of future, friendship, relationships.At the same time it is quite entertaining comedy with jokes above the waist for a change.And then there is theme of respect against women. So in general funny and entertaining movie for Friday night.",Magic Mike XXL

There should really be a place like this in real life. There was a scene that came out of nowhere that didn't make sense till later that was very confusing. Other than that I loved this movie from beginning to end except the chocolate up the leg on the one act. I loved that the whole movie was interesting not just parts of it. I am always going to love Channing Tatum in every movie he's in, but this one he is the best. In my eyes he is a legend almost and definitely should get hottest guy.

This is a movie about hot guys dancing - what this movie delivers.... Hot guys dancing.The first magic Mike film was seriously depressing and anyone who says they 'loved' it is obviously a flagellate that likes a bit of punishment for their sins.This movie is far more fun. The dance routines are better than the first flick and everyone looks like they are having a good time.Get some friends together, have a couple of champagnes and have a good time along with them.",Magic Mike XXL

Was expecting a fun sequel with hunks dancing but what the viewers got was a story with no interesting plot that was all over the place and almost no striptease show. The stuff they did show was distasteful and I would go as far as saying GROSS! 3 years ago I was having so much fun while watching Magic Mike and when I saw the news we'll get a sequel I was expecting a clever continuation but it was serious disappointment. That's 10$ lost and a feeling of a wasted time which is a shame as Channing Tatuum is a great actor.

113,here_nowhere_3,I loved it...,8,10 October 2015,"The first movie was advertised to be a guilty pleasure dance intensive movie but it turned out to be a Soderbergh drama full of drugs, desperation, and penis pumps. It's one thing to put your best foot forward in a trailer, it's another to out right lie about what kind of movie you made. I was beyond annoyed and rather skeptical going into XXL. XXL turned out to be everything I wanted the first to be and more. It's fun, funny, has heart, has more dancing, better dancing, plus I'm pretty sure the guys got hotter. It's a guilty pleasure but has a message about being yourself. It's also kind of empowering, everyone is given their dignity and ownership of their sexuality and is shown as deserving of attention and affection. The movie never gets mean, even when it would be easy to do so for a cheap laugh. The convenience store scene is everything, so funny and well staged. Matt Bomer sings and it's amazing. Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss is an excellent addition to the cast. The Mike/Malik finale is just incredible dance work. Jada is a goddess and owns every single second she's on screen. I left the theater with a smile on my face and will happily re-watch this on DVD over and over.",Magic Mike XXL
114,PerksofbeingDivergent,Beyond better than the first.,10,1 July 2015,"In my opinion, this movie was amazing, especially compared to the first one. I love Jada Pinkett in this movie. The music, dancing, cast, and plot was amazing. I don't regret paying money to see it. Not only was it sexy it was comedic as well. It went above and beyond what my standards of this movie originally was. This movie didn't just focus on one character (Magic Mike) but it let the others get recognition and allowed their personalities to be known. Every part of the movie (to me) was intriguing. Don't get me wrong I liked the first movie but hands down Magic Mike XXL is BEYOND better. I'm stating that based on plot, cast, stunts/performance, script, and soundtrack. 10/10 for sure.",Magic Mike XXL
115,soumibiswas5,Awesome!,10,19 October 2015,"Thanx for bringing a movie like this in different countries where these facilities are not easily available. At least women can enjoy a little bit through your movies. The strippers are shown in the light and positive light in the face of all their struggles. Its a good one. Keep it up. I just hope the goal of this story can be achieved someday all over the world. All the actors and actresses were brilliant. Yes, it can survive without Dallas. He's not all and all. It's very courageous of Channing Tatum to do a movie based on his life even after facing so many difficulties early in the life. You are actually healers who can bring a smile to someone.",Magic Mike XXL
116,Tsrow32,Why Such Harsh Reviews?,9,12 July 2015,"The boys came back with a bang! Magic Mike XXL was far superior to the first Magic Mike. It was funny, entertaining, and had a fantastic vibe celebrating all types of women. They really got it right making the women in the film feel important and valued just for being them and the overall message was very positive about women being celebrated and appreciated no matter what size, age, or color they happen to be. As far as the dancing goes, it was fantastic. Very entertaining and there's a particular scene with Joe Manganiello in it that will have everyone doubled over laughing and all of the women drooling. There were some new guys who were featured in the film that I thought were fantastic dancers as well.They didn't try to incorporate any awkward plot lines that didn't fit with the theme of the movie, which they did in the first one. They kept this movie flowing all the way through with laughs, entertainment, and fantastic dancing. All of the guys played their characters very well. Matt Bomer in particular. This movie is obviously geared more towards women but there are several men that would enjoy the humor interlaced throughout the film.Overall I give Magic Mike XXL 9/10. It's the perfect summer movie to take friends to for some great laughs and to feel like you're along for the party with some ""male entertainers"" that know how to have a good time. When's the third one coming?",Magic Mike XXL

This is the kind of movie you go to ogle the hot half naked men and enjoy watching their ""moves"". I'm just saying I would definitely see it again, and give it a chance of you like movies with dancing and again hot half naked men!Sure I agree with others that there wasn't a real story line, but that didn't leave me disappointed to be honest. Sometimes it's just nice to see a movie where you can tell the actors had a lot of fun in making it, which in turn just makes it fun to watch! Did I mention hot half naked men? If you thought it was going to be about something deeper then you might be disappointed. Point in case it was hot!",Magic Mike XXL

I haven't seen the first movie from 2012 and came accidentally across MM XXL. Even though some reviewers here say the first one was better... well... I guess I'll simply skip it. I gave in to watch this one because my wife wanted to watch it. However, in the end even she thought it was BS.",Magic Mike XXL
119,gribbinshelleya,Seriously?1,2,17 July 2015,"Wow, not sure what I just watched. I mean the first one wasn't that good, but this one was terrible. There was NO storyline! I think my favourite part of the whole movie was when Mike started to let loose to Pony at the very start of the movie... and then the mirror scene right at the end, although it was very raunchy! But everything in between was a waste and so disappointing. I would have preferred to see non famous REAL dances doing REAL dance moves than to watch famous actors flash there body & pretend they can dance & strip! I had a good laugh that's for sure, but the funniest part was when I turned to my best friend & found her with her eyes shut & mouth wide open, fast asleep next to me! That's when you know it was a really great movie right? NOT!!!! Even though it was bad, I'm glad I got to see it for myself.",Magic Mike XXL
120,bojdbsn,This movie gave me cancer,1,27 January 2016,"This past summer my best friend and I had the fun idea, being ladies of the single variety, to have a girls day topped off with Magic Mike XXL. We went into the theater with high hopes, lots of popcorn, and the last of what we would later discover to be our sex drive. What promise Channing Tatum's face brought, was completely robbed by this whiny, over- emotional, plot-lacking, and labedo-murdering film.Come the second scene of the movie, you start to discover this movie wasn't made for you at all; seeing as you're not a fat, middle-aged woman who secretly dreams of being a drag queen. This movie was clearly intended for the LGBT and love-lost community and I have to applaud them in trying to reach the love-less audience, especially seeing as they surpassed their goal tremendously and succeeded in making the entire audience asexual. Half way through the film my ovaries shrank and fell my out my butt. At which point I grew a penis, which also fell off. This film was by far the most sexually confusing, life-unsettling experience I have ever had. I went in with what was my best friend and upon leaving, we were strangers with no desire to move on. We could barely even leave the theatre.My skin aged ten years and I lost the ability to bare children, which was actually fine since I won't be procreating any time soon anyway. All the male strippers were whiny and annoying the whole movie, complaining about penis size and lack of romance in their lives. What do you expect? You decided to make a sequel.It's no wonder Alex Pettyfer wasn't in the film (the only redeemable character from the first). I'm sure he's off somewhere living a happy, stress-free, sex-filled life. Lucky him. I mean, I would have even preferred to see a Mathew Mcconaghey's leathery ass doing anything. He got wise too. Now I'm here, with cancer, no sexual organs and a life of regret. Overall I would say an amazing movie 10/10 would recommend.",Magic Mike XXL

I saw this movie in the theater when it came out, and the whole audience was having a great time. Sometimes, you need something light and sweet! I will say, tho, if you are straight guy, you probably won't like it, because it definitely was not made for you. Enjoy!",Magic Mike XXL
123,jacquelinebroersen,A movie that puts a smile on your face,8,28 August 2015,"I can understand why people might not like this movie. I asked around and the reasons I got back were ""There wasn't enough nakedness"" or ""The storyline wasn't good enough"" and even ""It was just boring"" but to be honest it's a movie about strippers, so do you really expect a good storyline? So after hearing all these reviews from friends and even reading about it, I still went to see it for myself and the movie didn't bore me at all. I even thought this one was way better then the first one because I thought the first one was a bit weird (apart from the stripping part) and I haven't seen it after that first time.The thing that made me really like this movie is because it made me smile the entire time! I did not loose my smile during the entire movie. I loved the fast that they focused on the bond between the guys and I loved the fact that it didn't focus on couples and that there wasn't really any romance in it. It was just a fun movie to watch and that's exactly what I loved about.Yes it was not the best movie ever but did it disappoint me in any way? No it did not and I will definitely see it again!",Magic Mike XXL
124,waketodream,What a surprise,8,5 September 2015,"I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Of course it's not anything ground-breaking, but it's good for what it is. It took me a little to get into it, but when the dancing started I got hooked. In my opinion the movie was way better than the first one. It's a fun one and not trying to be anything more than it is. On the other hand, it's surprisingly diverse (female and male characters, POCs). Usually movies like this are full of problematic lines/characters, but with this one I can't think of a single thing. No racist stereotypes, no sexism, no macho stuff, it's sex-positive and celebrates women of all sizes.",Magic Mike XXL

I saw it twice opening weekend and plan on seeing it a few more times in the theatre. The soundtrack is amazing (though warning not all the great songs from the movie are on the soundtrack, big bummer), the cast was fantastic and the dancing, oh my goodness it is beyond imagination. script wasn't an Oscar winner but it was better than the first one by far. I loved the first Magic Mike and this was 100x better than the first. The men are so hot! But I would watch a 3 hour movie of Channing Tatum just cleaning the house and paying bills. He's my favorite actor! To sum up its a fun night for the girls, it wasn't made to win movie of the year. But in my book for a 37 year old fan, it definitely was my movie of the year!

128,cloudsconspire,Could Use a Little More Magic,8,1 July 2015,"Compared to the first MM, Magic Mike XXL is less a morality tale and more of a roadtrip romp. I liked the first film a bit more, but have no doubt I'll be in the minority on that. The first film's Soderberghiness gave the story a bit more gravitas, which is missing from XXL. It was still a lotta fun.Disappointed that Chatum had the lights down on his six-pack through the film. In his recent Reddit AMA, he said his fave sandwich was pb&j with Cheetos inside -- Little cause and effect there. The dancing wasn't as effective in XXL; overall, I'd say the film is missing the 'female gaze'.",Magic Mike XXL

It doesn't have a storyline like the first one, the first one wasn't supposed to have one. It's a story about male strippers. You're getting what you paid for. Male strippers and hot women(mostly, they put in some ugly fat chicks for some reason). The user reviews I'm reading here on IMDb look like they come from the same demographic. 40+ year old women who are disgusted by the strippers 'objectifying' those poor little 20 some year olds having fun. I clicked 3 random reviews and saw ""Cleopatra James(1973) - I saw this film the weekend it came out in 1973 downtown Baltimore"" and more along the lines of ""I remember seeing this movie when I was 15 years old"". If you find yourself in this demographic the movie's not targeted at you.Basically... what I'm trying to say is that the movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be, you watched the trailer, you read the synopsis, that's what you're gonna get.

You can't really expect for it to have a great story line as it was 2nd film and it's all about the show?! If you as a woman can't enjoy a bit of a show from few sexy men, then sorry..go back to your boring marriage life. Shows were great, I couldn't stop smiling, great entertainment! All of the boys were brilliant dancers, film uplifts your mood, and makes women feel special, what's wrong about that? It can be quite cheeky, women love it tho!I'd never say it's a film to watch with your husband unless he can appreciate art.

I must admit, the guys have few nice moves, but the whole scenario and storyline was just not good enough, it was even boring.I gave it 2 out of 10 because I just think the movie is a failure. Like they were too lazy to make one good movie. Sorry producers, that's just my opinion.If you wanna watch it, okay, do it. But don't expect too much. Except Channing. He is always too good. Haha :D",Magic Mike XXL
135,nikejung-28015,"Hilarious, joyful, exuberant play - just let go and enjoy the ride",10,24 July 2015,"I loved this film. It is hilariously funny, it has a great soundtrack, and watching Tatum dance like melted butter is a joy in itself. It is also filled with all sorts of types of men and women, who are being remarkably kind to each other, it keeps tickling you with the beginnings of what could be stockpile templates but then verges away.Don't take this film literally – how flimsy is the premise of a lot of fiction films? -, enjoy its visual exuberance, and take the sexual as the embrace of kindness and love for people and longing for connectedness that it is. At one point, Tatum is basically confronted with a version of the argument that his story doesn't add up, and he basically offers a clue to how to read the film when he replies, clumsy-cute: Look this isn't about (fill in literal interpretation of the plot), this is about you and me (putting things behind/doing something together)This is the joy of play – play as simulation, make belief, the joy of the process and the ride that is life. Written down, this weepy and pathetic whereas the film just offers this up in emotion, movement, and music: Embrace life, joy, and people, as they are, be kind to each other, believe in your dreams and especially your friends – you may fail, but you will try, and the dreaming is part of the fun.",Magic Mike XXL

It's sexy but actually hilarious to see these beautiful men make fun of themselves. Twitch, Michael Strahan and of course- Magic Mike and all the others take their turn in delighting and empowering women. That's the difference of this movie and the first one is that they all make a choice to make women feel like ""queens"". Jada Pinkett Smith is a Queen in this as the MC.

Men going on 40 years old being male strippers...lol. I've been to many male strip shows and the avg age is around 21 y.o., not 38! Chan was cute for this role a few years ago, but this is way over the top. These actors must be desperate for all the money they can rake in, (and their wives too). If you're this desperate for strip show sex, just go to a strip club. This might be a joke if it wasn't so sad. Channing Tatum 35, Joe Manganiello 38, Kevin Nash 55, Matt Bomer 37, Michael Strahan 43, Adam Rodriguez 40.

You try pretty hard to find something seems a little bit interesting in the last 30 mins. You just wanna kill yourself in the rest of the movie. I expected there's more dancing scenes or fun part. What I feel in the storyline wasn't very frequent, but irritated. I saw the first one, I don't really remember the details of it but at least I like it . The male entertainer or stripper makes the women look so cheap and dumb. Some of the scenes even make me feel sick. I'm sorry I feel that way but this movie can totally be on the worst movie list of mine.",Magic Mike XXL
139,donart-32790,"XXL is for extra extra large..dialogue, boring bits and plot holes",4,10 July 2015,"It was a long, odd and unexpected telling of a very short story. I won't go into a synopsis of the story: you can read other reviews for that. Maybe the marketing of the movie had something to do with the resulting disappointment. Had been marketed as more 'cerebral' then the viewer would be better prepared. But since it was touted as 'hot dancing' that's what you're waiting for. And you do wait.There's so much dialogue. The script needed a brutal editing: the essential plot points and character 'developments' should have come out much quicker. The dialogue between Mike and the female interest when they meet is obscure. If they had the conversation they have nearly half the movie later, at that point, it would have established the character interplay more effectively. There were quite a few conversations had that make that little voice in your head ask, ""What's this about? Why are we getting this information from the character?"" Ken and a new character have a long conversation in the front of the car about singing, but it too, could have been edited to make the point more clearly and quickly.The 'MC-ing' (the Mcconaughy job in the original) was over-done. It slowed the movie down to snail's pace. Stripping is all about ENERGY and the movie had none. It wandered along delving into corners and backing out again without adding value to the plot. (This might be a spoiler) Their truck goes off the road early in the movie because the driver fell asleep and the movie does the same. The production values were noticeably low. The background sound transitions were non-existent: scenes were just slammed up against each other. This can be for dramatic effect (sparingly) but it was like home video just stuck together. Again, with the two guys in the front of the car, the driver slapped his knee six times while delivering his lines. Those sounds wouldn't be picked up by the boom mic so foley artists would add it back in post production but why? It was an irrelevant distraction to the scene. Tatum seems very relaxed in his role. Apparently these two Mike movies have loosely been about his performance roots: he was a stripper in his early days. He is listed as a producer but a script writer but maybe he was bringing back 'the old days.' There's nothing wrong with that but you have to bring back the essence, the atmosphere and emotion, not all the detail. Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer stole the show out from under Tatum's over-grown-skater-dude's nose. These charactersdeveloped, somewhat unevenly, throughout the plot but gave it depth and heart. Without that the movie would have been unwatchable as there would have been nothing left to hold your interest. Yes, there's some skin and a little bit of 'dancing' but there's way better movies for that(even Tatum's STEP was better.) There were three good scenes which, in order of goodness, were (I don't think these spoil anything): 1. Tatum and the garage table. He's having fun and takes us with him. It's early in the movie and promises good things to come (that don't.) 2. Joe and the drink machine. Again, outright fun while developing the character. It's a pity there wasn't more of this type of scene in the movie. It would have rounded out all the characters. 3. Matt Bomer and ""Heaven."" I think the girls will like this bit and not for the reason you might think. It was just really touching. So when the plot finally reaches it's 'peak' it's pretty flat and lacking energy. This is where the voluminous mc-ing from Jada Pinkett Smith is just plain annoying. She played her character well, there was just way toooooo much of it. This whole section of the movie should have been longer(more dancing), but contrastingly, seriously edited to be much tighter (more dancing).Again, this might be a spoiler, but you get the impression that some of the boy crew can't dance. And If not, I still wouldn't have bothered trying to disguise it. While the plot might have been trying the 'live your dream at least once' angle I don't think that was done the least bit convincingly. I would have dumped (edited) all those ancillary routines into one and cut it very short, and if the mc-ing was still needed (the plot forced it a little) then it could have been put over the top and gotten out of the way much more quickly. It took too long to lead up to too little. It may sound like I hated it. I didn't. But I certainly didn't love it. Those three scenes saved it for me. Even the surprise that the movie had tried (but somewhat, failed) to have more depth than the marketing would have us believe, was a nice surprise. It's a shame it didn't quite come off. I think an experienced script editor could have easily rescued it. As for Tatum, I don't know if he's a good actor or just very comfortable in his skin. This movie didn't ask much from him. He delivers his lines with conviction and you get the feeling the dialogue hasn't taken him too far from home. However, I'm hoping this is the last of his over-grown-skater-dude movies. Yes, that's how I described him before and that's how he turns up in most of his movies: big dopey kid cruising around the set with his baseball cap on backwards, and dragging at his over-sized jeans. I think he's capable of much more and hope he goes and tries. As Game of Thrones put it "" Kill the boy and let the man take over."" Maybe with this XXL meandering down memory lane will let him put the past to rest and he can move on.",Magic Mike XXL
140,yvonne-32761,Pure escapism bathed in Southern sunshine,9,11 July 2015,"Okay, it's official: this is my feel-good movie of 2015. Nothing's going to top it. It's funny, clever, and surprisingly subversive. And as for that boy - you know, the one who can dance - he's finally got old enough to begin to be interesting. And, dear lord, he can still dance! Magic Mike XXL is an altogether lighter, frothier confection than its predecessor. There's not much room here for serious plot structure – it's pure escapism bathed in Southern sunshine and marinated in a cocktail of pecs, biceps and spray-on tan. All the remaining characters from the original film get a bit more character development, but it's not overdone; watching this film is far from being an intellectual exercise.The film is full of parody, and sends itself up as much as the other films it references. Mike's familiar ineffectual bumbling, here ramped up to an almost irritating degree, masks an incisive mind that is at work manipulating the rest of his crew until at the final moment they are all exactly where he wants them to be. This is where Channing Tatum shines: in a darker character, these machinations would be sinister or chilling, but he only wants what's best for everybody – and in a film as light and sweet as candy floss everyone can get what they deserve, even if it's only for five minutes under the spotlights in a rowdy club.There were a couple of reluctant boyfriends amongst the overwhelmingly female audience at the cinema, and they both belly-laughed within the first few minutes. It's good. Don't take my word for it. You deserve to have the same goofy grin on your face - pure pleasure.",Magic Mike XXL
141,GingerPineapple,A Fun Movie - doesn't deserve all the bad reviews,10,17 July 2015,"I checked IMDb before watching this movie and I expected it to be really bad. But it was actually funny and I really liked it. Obviously, people who go to see it don't expect an intellectual movie or a superb plot. So for what it is, it was pretty awesome. The dance routines were fun and it had some good humor. I didn't regret spending 1h 50min watching it. I went for a fun movie and that's exactly what I got. It's a candy for the eyes. The guys looked great. I enjoyed it.The whole theater was bursting into laughter. I don't know why a guy would want to see it but there were a couple of guys there (to my amusement). I thought most of the scenes were done with taste. And they made Magic Mike look ridiculously hot. I haven't seen the first movie so I don't have anything to compare it to.",Magic Mike XXL

There's some complaints about plot, old things from the first movie, whatever. I respect other people's opinions, and I agree with some of them, but overall, the movie was great.The point of Magic Mike XXL is to give ladies/gents (whether single or taken) some eye candy at hot dancing. They achieved this well. The first scene with Channing Tatem in his shop, that was a warm up. Admittedly it takes them a while to get to the stuff (aka guys stripping, shoving their junk in the women's face, whatever you're into) but that's fair. This isn't a porno for heaven's sakes, but it's not suitable for children. I wouldn't take my little sister to this. Overall, I thought this movie did it's purpose- being a 14 dollar ladies night out party with some plot. That's the point, and I liked it and I highly recommend this for a fun night out.",Magic Mike XXL

Loved seeing Channing work his amazing body!!! A very talented, watchable dancer. Loved the convenience store routine with Joe. Loved the finale scene with Channing and tWitch. There were some good moments and some funny moments here and there. Could it have been better, sure. And by that I mean more dance time- with less clothes on- for Channing, Joe and and Matt. This is why I liked the first one better- at least their pants came off more often!

144,slowmelt,Worst movie ever?,1,11 September 2015,"This film comes close to failing on every imaginable level - but even fails to accomplish that, as one scene (one, single) is actually funny. The rest of the movie is cringe worthy, utterly predictable, totally formulaic (hence predictable, fair enough), exceedingly tacky, repetitive and incredibly boring. Towards the end it becomes so bad that it is actually funny, but most of the time, you don't even get that. The only good thing about watching a movie like this is that it gives you a real appreciation for how difficult it actually is to make a good movie. Some of it might have looked good on paper, a lot of the scenes/dynamics worked well in the (good) movies they were copied from and yet, here, they just fall completely flat on their face (not literally, no spoiler here).",Magic Mike XXL
145,ClassRock67,Worst Movie Ever,2,14 November 2015,"This might be the worst movie I ever watched. This movie had absolutely nothing that I feel was worthy of talking about except that i feel it made me more stupid after watching it. The acting was bad and the script was even worse. Part of it is the who is behind the movie and part of it is just Hollywood nowadays. Anyone who read this script, would okay it and think that this movie would be good should be fired. I could film a better movie then this without a script, Just show up with a film crew some actors. I am not a big fan of Channing Tatum, I think that he is just a pretty face and a nice body put on the screen to sell tickets to women.",Magic Mike XXL
