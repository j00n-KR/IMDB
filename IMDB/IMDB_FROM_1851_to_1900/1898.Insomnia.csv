0,TheLittleSongbird,Hardly a sleeper,8,24 January 2017,"As said in my reviews for his masterpiece 'Memento' and the fascinating 'The Prestige', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Insomnia' is not one of Nolan's best films, but not his worst. For me it's somewhere in the middle if ranking his films, 'Memento' being his best and, while with a lot of impressive elements, 'Interstellar' being the one that impressed least. It shows fidelity to the Norwegian original, but doesn't go so far that it's a pale retread, in a way that is summed up very well by Roger Ebert.Nolan directs with impeccable style and sense of atmosphere, as well as an ability to tell a potentially convoluted story with clarity without resorting to excess and over-ambition. Much of 'Insomnia' is exceptionally well made, while beautiful Alaska has rarely been more oppressive as well while the cinematography has grit and class. David Julyan's music score is not quite as complex as that for 'Memento', but has a very effective eeriness.The script is tight and thoughtful, and the story, filled with neat twists and turns, is hugely compelling and atmospheric, never being too simple but complex enough to still be understandable and be respectful to the viewer. The cat and mouse stuff could have been predictable and convoluted but executed in masterly hair-raising but also quiet tension.Performances are all strong across the board. While underused somewhat, Martin Donovan and especially Hilary Swank are great here. It is however Al Pacino and Robin Williams who are even better. Pacino gives perhaps his best performance since 'Heat' and he has to me definitely not been on this amount of blistering form as he is in 'Insomnia'. Williams is cast against type, and he plays a genuinely terrifying character with menace but also dignity and restraint.Flaws are only a couple, with the film ending too conveniently and some of the editing being a touch too jumpy.All in all, a gripping film and hardly a sleeper. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Insomnia
1,Leofwine_draca,"A reminder of what a good director, script, and cast can achieve",9,5 August 2016,"Christopher Nolan follows the flawless MEMENTO with this, another one-word title film and another inventive, superb effort. Based on a Norwegian movie (which I haven't, as yet, seen), this tells the oft-told tale of a world-weary cop vs. a nasty and particularly slimy killer. What makes it special is the script – very believable and down-to-earth – and the characters, who are so realistically drawn that you can easily believe they are living, breathing people. The setting of the icy, desolate Alaskan town is very good indeed, combined with excellent cinematography which brings out every characteristic of the location and makes it feel really unique. Nolan shoots his film expertly, mixing in some fine chase and action sequences (the log run is brilliantly conceived) with the heavier, more dramatic moments.Al Pacino is fine in the role of the ageing, flawed cop. Sure it's a performance we've all seen before but he makes it extra special with his singular powers of method acting and realism. You feel tired just looking at his weary, end-of-the-road cop. The supporting cast are all fine but it's Robin Williams who really steals the show as the killer, Finch. Williams is nasty, slimy, villainous, creepy, and totally scary, a mundane and quiet little man who's prone to bursts of a violent psychopathic nature. The film remains unpredictable throughout, letting the suspense build gradually as the cat-and-mouse storyline increases the tension, before ending in a sudden burst of violence and excitement. Magnificent stuff, sadly all too rare these days in Hollywood but a reminder of what a good director, a good script and a good cast can really do.",Insomnia
2,SnoopyStyle,great actors in compelling remake,8,15 August 2015,"LAPD homicide detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are brought to the small town of Nightmute, Alaska to help with the investigation of the murder of 17 year old Kay Connell. The partners are facing an investigation by IA back home. Local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is a big fan of Dormer. The police sets a trap. Dormer accidentally kills Eckhart in the fog and he works to hide his mistake. Dormer has insomnia from the perpetual daylight and his guilt. Kay was a fan of crime writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams).Director Christopher Nolan kept the moodiness of the Norwegian original and added some compelling tension. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are terrific. It holds up to the original without tearing it down.",Insomnia
3,Hitchcoc,It Made Me Tired,9,26 May 2010,"Al Pacino's character looked tired when he arrived in the Alaskan town. As he attempts to reconcile a serious mistake, he grows wearier and wearier. Enter Robin Williams, a sociopath who plays a cat and mouse game with Pacino. Balance that against the perceptive and admiring Hillary Swank and a lot of baggage from Pacino, and you have the ingredients for a terrific thrill a minute film. I found myself rooting for the Pacino character even though there is a level of dishonesty that will be hard to reconcile. He must cover some huge tracks. There are some issues with Williams' ability to know things that are a little far fetched. Many villains fall into that gap, but that's OK. We take him for what he is. It's an engaging movie.",Insomnia
4,Prismark10,Murder and sunlight,5,24 August 2014,"Insomnia is a remake of a Norwegian thriller which features the trio of Oscar winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank.However this is Pacino's film. He plays seasoned LA Detective Will Dormer arriving at rural Alaska somewhere north of the Arctic Circle in the height of summer when it does not get dark to solve the murder of a teenage girl. Back in LA he is under investigation by Internal Affairs and his partner, who arrives with him to Alaska (Martin Donovan) is looking like that he will buckle under pressure.While in pursuit of the possible killer in heavy fog, Dormer ends up shooting dead his partner. Was it deliberate or an accident?Dormer now has to cover up his tracks to show that the suspect shot his partner but Robin Williams who plays crime writer Walter Finch claims to have seen what Pacino did to his partner and there begins a game of cat and mouse. Finch played in a sinister but restrained manner by Williams is cold and calculating exploiting the vulnerable Dormer who is confused, tired and sleep deprived because of the lack of darkness. Finch offers Dormer a deal to frame the teenage girl's boyfriend in exchange for his silence as to what happened to his partner.Swank plays a young police investigator at first excited to be working with Dormer and then has to investigate his partner's killing.This was Christopher Nolan's first major Hollywood film and he was entrusted with three academy winning actors. Williams gives an understated performance, Swank provides warmth and steely determination but it is Pacino who is the centre as he looks to wrest control while staying up for days without sleep and sparring with Williams.However the film with its rural Alaskan vibe does not really fire on all cylinders. I expected Nolan to gives us a film that is slightly offbeat and maybe a touch surreal.Swank looks wasted, its a role any competent actress can perform. It actually lacks chills and thrills.",Insomnia
5,classicsoncall,"""I'm not telling anyone anything. We're partners on this.""",7,18 December 2019,"I think the death of Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) could have been made more ambiguous with a bit more clever writing. Instead, we're pretty much convinced by Dormer's motivation to get Eckhart out of the way due to a pending Internal Affairs investigation back in L.A. The finale confirms it when Dormer advises Detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) - ""Don't lose your way"" - at the point she was willing to cut him a break with the death of murder suspect Walter Finch (Robin Williams). We know early on that Dormer was a dirty cop, but keeping the viewer in the dark about his shooting of Hap would have made for a darker, more deeply psychological thriller.With that, the set up for the story was pretty good, and the way Dormer used his vast background and experience to sniff out Walter Finch for the murder of Kay Connell was exemplary police work. But you immediately knew he was crooked with the switching of the bullet from Finch's discarded weapon, with the one that could have 'accidentally' killed his partner. If the seasoned detective had been up front and admitted he shot Hap, it would certainly have looked bad, but I think the accident argument could have been pulled off. At least in Nightmute, Alaska; back home the suspicions of his superior would have been raised.I was curious about the location of this story, so I looked it up, and in fact there is a Nightmute, Alaska. During the 2010 census it had a population of two hundred eighty. Not too much trouble to narrow down who might have been a murderer in such a small town, and with this story we got two for the price of one. Dormer's insomnia hadn't seen nothing yet.",Insomnia
6,lee_eisenberg,Mr. Method vs. Mr. Anything Goes,10,23 July 2007,"Knowing that Al Pacino and Robin Williams co-star in Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"", we would probably expect Pacino to play an evil antagonist and Williams a wacky protagonist. But it's not like that. It's not the opposite, either. The description of the movie's plot needs to be a long one.Pacino plays LA detective Will Dormer, under investigation by internal affairs for misconduct. That's when the sleep-deprived Dormer - note the irony in his surname - gets sent to Alaska to catch a killer in a small town. Upon arriving, Dormer quickly learns that in Alaska during the summer, the sun never sets. Already beginning to lose his mind due to events back home, Dormer falls apart further as he unsuccessfully tries to cover up the sunlight in his hotel room. Probably the best representation of his mental breakdown is what he does with the floorboard.But the hitherto events are nothing compared to what follows. While investigating a crime scene, Dormer kills a partner. Not only does he have this on his consciousness, but he gets a call from Walter Finch (Robin Williams), the man whom he is supposed to catch. Finch knows what Dormer did. Almost all events from henceforth will serve to show Dormer's breakdown and how Finch can use it against him.I don't know whether I would call ""Insomnia"" an absolutely perfect movie, but it's pretty close. One of the most effective scenes - at least in my view - is Dormer running through the empty street in the middle of the night, which of course looks like it could be midday. This potentially friendly small town has turned into the cruelest of settings for Dormer. No character is really a hero or villain; everyone seems to be a little bit of both. Equally as good as Pacino and Williams is Hilary Swank as Ellie Burr, a detective participating in the investigation. Seemingly a nice young woman, even she might have a few skeletons in her closet.All in all, I certainly recommend this movie. Christopher Nolan brought to it the same intensity that he instilled in ""Memento"", and showed the sorts of tricks that he would later bring to ""Batman Begins"". Above all, it was part of what I called Robin Williams's comeback in 2002: aside from his comedy tour (which I saw when he came to Portland), he played sinister roles in ""Death to Smoochy"", ""Insomnia"" and ""One Hour Photo"", so as to make up for the excessively maudlin ""Jakob the Liar"" and ""Bicentennial Man"".So the next time that the sun doesn't set, just be careful...",Insomnia
7,jboothmillard,Insomnia,10,4 March 2005,"Memento was a brilliant inventive thriller from director Christopher Nolan, and this next film from him has the same impact. Basically Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is sent from the city to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaskan town, along with his accomplice Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), and partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan). When they go to the scene of the crime, they see a man in the fog, and Dormer follows him in the fog with Eckhart, and unfortunately, he accidentally shoots his partner instead of the man. Instead of admitting to his guilt, he covers his tracks and makes an alibi. As he tries to sleep he is both thinking of his dead partner and what he has done, this is the insomnia. But soon his sleep will become less achievable when the man he tried to shoot, and the teenager's murderer calls and blackmails him. They eventually arrange to meet secretly, the man is local book writer Walter Finch (a non-comedic Robin Williams) who claims to share the same problem as Dormer, he accidentally killed the teenager. Also starring Liar Liar's Maura Tierney as Rachel Clement and Nicky Katt as Fred Duggar. There are some fantastic chase sequences, Pacino and Williams chatting, and great concluding scenes where Williams is at his sinister best. Robin Williams was number 19, and Al Pacino number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pacino was also number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor. Outstanding!",Insomnia
8,ccthemovieman-1,Good Acting Elevates This 'Sleeper',8,9 October 2006,"Al Pacino's acting once again is a highlight of a film he's in. He has the capacity to dominate a film with his presence. In this re-make of the Norwegian film, Pacino is excellent as a good-yet-tainted policeman who starts to unravel after not sleeping for four or five days. The Alaskan summer, with light 24 hours of day, can do that to visitorsRobin Williams, meanwhile, plays a killer. It's funny how comedians can do so well playing dramatic roles and Williams is a prime example. He's especially good at creepy nut-cases (See ""One Hour Photo"") Williams doesn't enter the movie until about halfway through and he's fascinating in a low-key role (until the end).For a modern-day crime film, this doesn't have a lot of action but that's fine if the acting is this good and the story involving. Here, the acting is better than the story. Kudos to Hillary Swank, too, for her performance as the cop.The Alaskan scenery ain't bad, either.",Insomnia
9,moonspinner55,An enervated downer with dispiriting cat-and-mouse asides,5,18 May 2006,"L.A. police detective Al Pacino, a legend in his own time, is called to a town in Alaska to help solve the murder of a teenager. Fine cast, a promising director, but routine results--all chopped up in nerve-wracking fashion by the editor to make this as ""edgy"" as possible. It actually goes nowhere--slowly--for the first 30 minutes, but there are some twists later on and guilty-conscious stuff which ultimately gives the proceedings some subtext. Still, it's awfully formulaic by now, evoking all the serial killer movies from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" on down. In fact, Sean Penn's similar ""The Pledge"" was a far more gripping murder yarn/personal odyssey than this one. Al Pacino acts (and looks) convincingly beaten down, and he's intriguing as always; Robin Williams is in tight, low-key form; Hillary Swank is adorable (if limited). **1/2 from ****",Insomnia
10,dbdumonteil,Al Pacino is so tired he can't sleep,7,17 July 2004,"Two policemen, Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent in Alaska to make an investigation around the murder of a high school girl. Convinced that the murder was committed by a serial killer, Dormer decides to organize a police raid in an isolated house where seems to live the suspected murderer. But he (unintentionally?) kills his team mate. Fortunately, no-one saw him and because he doesn't want to be suspected, he gives a coherent reason about Eckhart's death which enables him to be saved. But the real murderer (Robin Williams) saw him killing Eckhart and starts to blackmail him.It is from this reversal of situation, the cop dominated by the killer, that ""Insomnia"" draws its originality. Here, several factors (that play in favor of Williams to the detriment of Pacino) explain this: Al Pacino's sickness: insomnia which prevents him from sleeping and especially the scenery where the action takes place, Alaska. An apparently peaceful land at least for its inhabitants but dreadful for foreigners, especially for Al Pacino. Indeed, the fact that it is always daylight only makes his sickness worse and makes him vulnerable in Williams' eyes. It is useful to add that Al Pacino is dazzling as an insomniac cop and the director Christopher Nolan emphasizes on his progressive weakening throughout the movie. On another hand, it is not a coincidence if his name is Dormer. It means ""sleeper"" in French so I think that only French people who watched this movie can appreciate the irony.With all that has been previously said, ""Insomnia"", according to me partly renews the detective movie. The result gives a solid and carefully constructed thriller. The sole shortcoming Christopher Nolan and his crew did is having hired Robin Williams to act the role of the killer. Throughout his career, he has been hired so many times in good roles and here, it is difficult to see him in the shoes of a criminal. Moreover, when he appears on the screen, the movie becomes quite talkative. These handicaps stop the movie from ranking among the greatest thrillers ever made but all the same, ""Insomnia"" constitutes a very good moment.",Insomnia
11,blanche-2,Al Pacino battles Robin Williams and no sleep,7,25 August 2005,"Sumptuous scenery and a fresh, enthusiastic Hillary Swank are in sharp contrast to weary Al Pacino in ""Insomnia,"" about a legendary LA homicide investigator who goes to Alaska to assist in finding a killer. In the land of the midnight sun, Pacino finds there's no rest from his demons.This is a slow-moving film at times, though the performances are very good. Pacino makes one tired just to look at him. As the film goes on, and he's had no sleep due to the constant light, his voice becomes raspy, his eyes are nearly shut, and he looks stupefied. He plays a complicated man, hounded by a departmental investigation and now a blackmailing killer. Like many of his other characterizations, Pacino gives us many layers of an imperfect man. Hillary Swank is very good, though wasted in a role that doesn't give her much to do except be young. Robin Williams, as a mystery author, turns in an excellent performance. Former General Hospital actor Jonathan Jackson has a small part as the victim's boyfriend. Jackson is very much a chameleon, playing a bad boy as if he was born to it.This was probably a disappointment in a movie theater at $10 a shot; it's perhaps more interesting as a rental or on television.",Insomnia
12,Quinoa1984,It is always the darkest in the light,10,24 May 2002,"(Possible spoilers ahead)Ok, that might sound like a cliche line for Insomnia, a remake here of the 1997 foreign version with Stellan Skarsgard, but why not once in a blue moon.  Anyway, this is indeed a topper for Christopher Nolan, over his 2001 independent backwards episode Memento, and brings his storytelling skills to a thriller set in Alaska.  Thus, Al Pacino plays the cop, a usual part to be sure, yet here brings an excellent feeling of desperation to try and find a way out of the muck of lies and torment that are in his life.  And for once, Alaska is shown as it truly is, either all night or all day (there are so many movies that get this wrong it's too lengthy to explain here) and how either one can drive the particular person crazed.  Here it is the constant shining of a itty bit of sunlight into his room at 3:30 AM.Pacino is on the case of a killer (Robin Williams) who's victim is a teenage girl.  This is handled in a good way, by turning it into not a cops and and bad guys movie, but more of a moral movie, one about getting caught in the most stressful of situations in dealing with control over life and the responsibility it follows.  It is not just the acting, which is above par, but also just the downright craft that drags you into the predominately first person dilemma (although Williams brings up some interesting points among his blackmail).  One more note: Williams has done something this year to me I'm not sure he's ever done- he has two movies from this year that are both grand dramatic, crazed performances and among his flops and utter misdemeanors (including another one he did this year, Death to Smoochy) there is a bit of praise for the guy.  As for the thriller here, one of the years best in conclusion. A+",Insomnia
13,wes-connors,Rage Against the Dying of the Light,9,28 December 2009,"""Invited to 'Nightmute', Alaska, to head a murder case, veteran LAPD detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) finds his investigation interrupted by an ever-shining midnight sun that wreaks sleep-depriving havoc on him - and by personal guilt over a second crime that may be real or a figment of his increasingly unstable consciousness,"" according to the DVD sleeve description.Director Christopher Nolan does an excellent job crafting a North American version of the original 1997 Norwegian crime drama, helped immensely by Hillary Seitz' intricate, intelligent adaptation.Also extraordinary are Mr. Pacino, cinematographer Wally Pfister, and editor Dody Dorn. Hilary Swank and Robin Williams effectively tone down their established personas. The smaller roles are beautifully realized - Paul Dooley, Larry Holden, Katharine Isabelle, Jonathan Jackson, Nicky Katt, and Maura Tierney deserve an ""ensemble cast"" award - and, Martin Donovan's ""Hap"" is particularly haunting.This film could have easily been nominated for six ""Academy Awards"" - but, probably, voters were sleepless in Chicago. Nevertheless, ""Insomnia"" shows Mr. Nolan, coming off ""Memento"" (2000), moving into the circle of upper echelon directors. Mr. Pfister knows how to hand-hold cameras, and Ms. Dorn's editing skills are sharp - hopefully, this team will receive some more film projects.********* Insomnia (5/3/02) Christopher Nolan ~ Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan",Insomnia
14,michaelRokeefe,Don't go to sleep! There is a crime to solve.,8,25 May 2002,"This is a thriller that just keeps stacking on the intrigue and excitement. Powerful and masterful acting. Al Pacino is a high profile detective that goes to Alaska with his partner to help out in a murder case. Hilary Swank plays a young cop that is also trying to solve the crime along with the Alaskan police. After Pacino accidentally kills his partner, he is blackmailed by the hunted sadistic killer(Robin Williams)who witnessed the shooting. When Pacino is not playing cat and mouse with Williams, he is trying like hell to get some sleep; but sleep doesn't come.
Pacino is convincing and it is really interesting to see the darker side of Williams. Swank is actually impressive and could have handled a meatier role. Kudos to director Christopher Nolan for the atmospheric chiller. Highly recommended.",Insomnia
15,sunwarrior13,Pacino And Nolan Delivers One Great Psychodrama,10,30 November 2011,"Insomnia is a psychological thriller film.It is a remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same title.It stars Academy Award winners namely: Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank together with Martin Donovan,Paul Dooley, Nicky Katt, Maura Tierney, and Jonathan Jackson. It was directed by Christopher Nolan,which happens to be his follow-up film after Memento.In Insomnia,Detective Will Dormer, a Los Angeles Police Department legend who temporarily escapes an internal affairs investigation that may ruin his career by traveling to Nightmute, Alaska, the remote site of a murder that has the local authorities flummoxed. Along with his partner, Hap Eckhart, and the small town's wide-eyed rookie investigator, Ellie Burr, the exhausted Dormer probes the brutal slaying of a teenage girl who was rumored to have a secret lover. A clever ruse quickly lures the killer into a police trap, but the suspect escapes and a tragic accident at the scene leaves Dormer at the mercy of the murderer, a pulp crime novelist named Walter Finch. As Finch plays a dangerous game of extortion with Dormer, the detective's mental health deteriorates rapidly from guilt over his complicity in a crime and sleep deprivation compounded by the lack of darkness in the land of the midnight sun. Meanwhile, the bright and dogged Ellie continues putting the pieces of a complex puzzle together despite Dormer's skillful attempts to lead the investigation toward the right suspect, but away from his own malfeasance.Insomnia proves once again why Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors we have today.It was well-made,well-written,stylish and truly enigmatic that does not lack tension,drama and suspense.It was a thriller whose style, structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story, you cannot separate them.It was interesting from beginning to end especially with Pacino,who delivers one of the best performances,as the insomniac police detective who makes the picture interesting.He was outstanding that we are able to sympathize with the moral complexities of his character.Aside from him,special mention also goes to Williams as the child murders who was excellent with his scenes with Pacino and Hillary Swank,who was never left behind with the great acting abilities of his co-stars.This is an great excellent film that one should never miss.",Insomnia
16,hitchcockthelegend,A good cop can't sleep because he's missing a piece of the puzzle. And a bad cop cant sleep because his conscience wont let him.,9,22 March 2012,"Insomnia is directed by Christopher Nolan and written by Erik Skjoldbjærg and Nikolaj Frobenius (1997 screenplay). It stars Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, Martin Donovan and Nicky Katt. Music is scored by David Julyan and cinematography by Wally Pfister. It's a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.LAPD detective Will Dormer (Pacino) and his partner Hap Eckhart (Donovan) travel to the remote Alaskan town of Nightmute to aid the local cops investigating the savage murder of a teenage girl. But Dormer leaves behind an Internal Affairs Investigation that gnaws away at him, and when a potential bust of the murder suspect goes tragically wrong, his conscious gets attacked on two fronts. By lack of sleep and by the killer himself.It's a House of Cards.Viewing from afar it's easy to be cynical and suggest that Insomnia is just an American remake cash in. Bigger budget, bigger stars and directed by an indie darling of the critics moving into the big league. While on the surface the plot looks to be another in a long line of cops and villains thrillers where procedural unfolds and evil is ultimately brought down at the end. Yet Insomnia is so much more than that, it's a deep movie dealing in complex psychological issues, a blanc-noir of some character substance, a picture clinically put together around one mans descent into a private hell, with the beautiful Alaskan backdrop perversely claustrophobic and Anthony Mann like in being at one with Will Dormer's fragmented state of mind.Killing changes you. You know that.From the opening moments as we observe a biplane flying over the Alaskan glaciers, accompanied by David Julyan's nerve tingling score, there's a looming air of disquiet. Nolan knows his noir onions, mood is everything and the dense psychological atmosphere is never once breached for the entire movie. Much of the picture is dialogue heavy, gratifyingly so, with the hushed conversations between Pacino and Williams begging the viewer to hang on every word as cop and killer (no spoiler, it's revealed to us early as a necessity) jostle for control of each others soul. What action there is also comes with a side order of otherworldly delights, a chase across floating logs and a stalk through eerie fog being the two particular highlights.Sleep comes at a cost.With three Oscar winners in the cast Nolan had some serious quality to direct, that Pacino, Williams and Swank deliver excellence is high praise for the British director. Pacino actually gives one of his finest late career performances, utterly compelling as Dormer, his haggard face tells of a thousand sorrows, his sleep deprived gait befits a man staring into the abyss. Wally Pfister's photography is on the money, the blend of snow whites and green tinges sparkle from the vistas and the soft brown hues inside the hotel provide the rare moments of tranquillity available to Will Dormer. Across the board Insomnia is a cracker of a movie, a film that goes into the murky depths of the genre to reveal one of the best movies of 2002. 9/10",Insomnia

18,Hey_Sweden,"This is definitely one to catch, folks.",9,17 September 2019,"Al Pacino is first-rate as an L.A. homicide detective named Will Dormer, dispatched (along with his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan)) to Nightmute, Alaska. They're going to assist an old friend, Chief Nyback (Paul Dooley), with a recent homicide up North. But they're also being distanced from controversy back home, as both detectives are currently being hounded by Internal Affairs.As it happens, figuring out who killed the victim won't be that difficult. (""Insomnia"" isn't really trying to be a whodunit.) The problem arises during pursuit of the suspect, Walter Finch (Robin Williams), and Finch starts playing a cat-and-mouse game with the weary veteran Dormer. Dormer is further hampered by the fact that in this locale, the sun doesn't set during this time of the year, and he can't get any sleep.An ""American-izing"" of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, ""Insomnia"" is a stunning, extremely well shot (Wally Pfister was the D.P.) police procedural thriller that derives much fascination from the evolving relationship between the detective and the killer. Dormer is *not* squeaky clean, and Finch is not a hardcore criminal; his act of murder was an impulsive crime of passion. That said, Finch does maintain a calm air about himself as he taunts the protagonist.Pacino and the always excellent Williams work together extremely well; this was from the latter's intriguing stretch during 2002 where he ""went dark"" with his role choices, having also appeared in the black comedy ""Death to Smoochy"" and another thriller, ""One Hour Photo"". They receive very strong support from Dooley, the engaging Hilary Swank (as an eager young cop who reveres Dormer and his career), Donovan, Maura Tierney, Jonathan Jackson, Katharine Isabelle, and Nicky Katt. (Look for Isabelles' ""Ginger Snaps"" series co-star Emily Perkins in a brief bit.)Director Christopher Nolan, working from the screenplay by Hillary Seitz, makes this a compelling entertainment that succeeds because it's not quite the typical, conventional cop vs. psycho Hollywood thriller. The attraction of seeing a triple threat of Oscar winners in Pacino, Williams, and Swank is just icing on the cake. Overall, ""Insomnia"" is a stirring, emotional journey, and comes highly recommended.Nine out of 10.",Insomnia

The movies is very quiet and punishingly slow at times. There are twists in the story but they're presented so casually that they have no effect at all.  The direction is annoying (especially during a junkyard sequence) but there is some stunning cinematography (Alaska is gorgeous).  Also, the story has been done before (and better).The performances help somewhat.  Pacino is great (as always).  He really anchors the film.  Swank is just wonderful but criminally underused.**SPOILER--KILLER'S IDENTITY REVEALED**It's not really a spoiler--everybody knows Robin Williams plays it--and he's just dreadful.  For starters, he doesn't show up until the movie is half over and he's so wooden and stiff.  He (unwisely) underplays the role.  It doesn't work.Why is this movie being so heavily praised?

But its really an easy bet, as is finally tipped in a Scene when he justifies His ""means to an end"".Overall, this is a laid-back, stylish, Neo-Noir that never becomes too awake and aware with most of it pacing at a steady, rhythmic, and rocking, motion that may seem dull to some, but never lacks sharp images and strong Characters in an attractive and foreboding environment.",Insomnia

There's not too much wrong with this yarn which sees two LA detectives who happen to be facing disciplinary hearings drafted to help the local cops in Alska solve the murder of a teenage girl. Al Pacino more or less phones it in as the main cop but Hilary Swank is good as the local version, dogged rather than inspired. Robin Williams has to wait over half the movie til he gets his chance to play cat-and-mouse with Pacino. Good but not memorable.",Insomnia
22,zardoz-13,Mediocre Murder Mystery Set in Alaska,4,21 March 2009,"You won't lose any sleep over ""Insomnia,"" the melancholic Al Pacino & Robin Williams psychological murder-mystery. Acclaimed director Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" (2000), has remade an outstanding 1977 Norwegian thriller, but turned it into a ponderous, profane (39 f-words), predictable, police procedural potboiler. Although Pacino and Williams usually deliver flawless performances, they act as if were suffering from insomnia rather than their characters. Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank of ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999) lurks on the periphery of this lugubrious cat & mouse melodrama like a naïve Nancy Drew, while Maura Tierney of ""Instinct"" fares no better in a lackluster supporting role as an innkeeper who sleeps with Pacino so ""Insomnia"" will have an obligatory one-night stand. Despite its mediocre, convoluted plot, ""Insomnia"" generates only a modicum of excitement during a couple of nail-biting interludes, but neither salvages this muddled morality play about redemption.Los Angeles Police Department Detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino of ""Any Given Sunday"") and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan, who played an FBI Agent in ""Malcolm X"") fly up to Nightmute, Alaska, to help local authorities solve the homicide of 17-year-old Kay Connell (Crystal Lowe) with her boyfriend, Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson) as the chief suspect. Actually, the real reason Dormer and Eckhart get packed off to the frozen north is to get out of Los Angeles while Internal Affairs reviews allegations of police corruption involving them. Dormer is a highly decorated, career cop accused of planting evidence to obtain convictions, and his younger partner Eckhart reveals that he has cut a deal with Internal Affairs. Immediately, Dormer fears Eckhart's testimony may reverse many of Dormer's cases and incriminate him. Meanwhile, rookie Alaskan cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) admires Dormer as a model cop and eagerly looks forward to working with him.No sooner has Dormer arrived that he has difficulty getting to sleep. An implacable sun shines twenty-four hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, and Dormer cannot catch enough shut-eye. In L.A., Internal Affairs suspects that Dormer killed. Nightmute Police Chief Charles Nyback (Paul Dooley of ""Runaway Bride"") assigns Ellie to investigate the shooting, while Dormer grilles the dead girls' classmates. Nevertheless, the accidental killing flushes out the real killer. He knows Dormer shot Eckhart, and he threatens to blackmail Dormer if the celebrated detective doesn't help him frame the dead girl's unsavory boyfriend. As for the murder investigation, Dormer observes that the killer went to a great deal of trouble to clean up the dead girl's corpse so as to eliminate any traces of DNA.For example, Dormer points out that the girl's fingernails have been trimmed. (If you're keeping track, Italian director Dario Argento used a similar ploy in his considerably more exciting 2001 whodunit ""Sleepless."" Anyway, the predictable plot thickens with Dormer and the police stake out an isolated cabin where the cops found the victim's back-pack. When a suspect shows up to take the bait, one of the clumsy Nightmute cops alerts him by keying his megaphone. During an erratic chase through blinding fog, Dormer guns down his partner accidentally, but he claims that the suspect did it. Dormer agrees to schedule a meeting with him on a river ferry.Director Christopher Nolan and freshman scenarist Hillary Seitz wait about an hour before they introduce mystery novelist Walter Finch (Robin Williams in the most muted performance of his career) as a suspect. Finch knew the dead girl, Kay Connell, well, because she visited him regularly and they have many conversations about literature. Meanwhile, Noland spends most of ""Insomnia"" dealing with Dormer's guilty conscience. Either Nightmute, Alaska, boasts no pharmacies or Dormer is too macho to gobble sleeping pills. Probably the best scene in this dreary detective yarn occurs when Dormer chases the suspect across a log flume. The elusive suspect leaps from one fast-flowing log to the next with nimble agility, but Dormer lacks his balance and timing. Dormer loses his footing, narrowly escapes getting his head crushed by the logs when he falls between them and winds up trapped underwater, struggling to hold his breath until a gap appears in the logs.. Sadly, nothing else proves as invigorating as this scene. Incredibly, before long even the sleepless Dormer begins to suspect that he has deliberately bumped off his partner. Long before ""Insomnia"" wears off, you'll know that you make a mistake if you wind up watching this wretched whodunit, too.",Insomnia
23,Boba_Fett1138,One of the better thrillers of the last couple of years.,8,1 August 2006,"Somehow I have the feeling that his movie is an underrated one. It's a not much talked about movie, that certainly deserves to be talked about. It has got a great compelling story and it is professionally directed by Christopher Nolan and acted by the fine cast.The movie starts of as a rather basic thriller but as the movie progresses it takes some nice turns. The story remains compelling throughout its entire running time for several reasons; the cast, the settings and the nice twists in the story.The movie its story is very well constructed. It works well as a murder-mystery/detective movie but luckily the story is so much more than this, thanks to some original twists in the story. The movie really starts to get good and interesting from the moment when the detective and the perpetrator are somehow forced to help each other to conceal both their crimes and form an unholy alliance but without ever fully thrusting each other. It makes the movie mostly unpredictable and provides the movie with some nice twists and tense moments.With Al Pacino in the lead, you just can't go wrong. He plays his character with eye for detail and in a sympathizing and honest way. He plays his part interesting, as well as realistic. This way we can always feel and cheer for the main character, even though some of his actions are far from being morally the right. Plus he looks like a very convincing insomniac as well. Also really excellent was Robin Williams in the role of the murderer. In ""One Hour Photo"" he already showed how well he can handle a non-comedy role but his role in this movie is perhaps even better, since the character itself is probably a more realistic every day person. Other fine actors such as Hilary Swank and Maura Tierney are also present but their roles aren't very challenging. Three Oscar winning actors together in one movie!The settings also work really well for the movie. At first sight, Alaska would seem like an unlikely cold and boring place to set a movie in. The nature however looks beautiful and certainly as well adds to the movie its atmosphere. Of course also the beautiful cinematography and subtle directing adds to this.From start to finish a great compelling thriller from talented director Christopher Nolan, with some superb acting in it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Insomnia

The visuals, the editing... effective and utilizing a nice range of what is possible in film-making, a clear grasp on the tools, without it ever being flashy or not having a purpose. The version I saw was on TV, so it could very well have been edited from the original version, please keep that in mind if something I say seems to be in complete contrast to what you thought. The plot is very good and develops interestingly throughout(some of them are... well, you'll see). The pace is not bad, if not all that fast. That is not to say that this doesn't hold tension... when it needs to, it's got it in spades. The acting is credible and skillful more or less for all the players. The cinematography and aforementioned cutting are masterful. Details captured, and the way in which the physical state is rendered... Christopher's career may have begun not too long ago, but I could definitely imagine that it will be worth following. It certainly has been so far.

25,view_and_review,Never Night,6,11 February 2021,"Today was my second time watching ""Insomnia"" and it was like watching it for the first time. Apparently, I didn't appreciate some of the finer qualities of the movie the first viewing. Not that I consider it a work of art now, but I do like it a little more.This movie had me torn. Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) was sent from L.A. to Night Mute, Alaska to help solve a murder. He came with his partner Detective Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) and the two of them brought a little baggage with them. Dormer was being investigated by Internal Affairs for something back in L.A. and Eckhart was going to cut a deal with I.A. which would have put Dormer on the chopping block.Fast-forwarding a bit; on a foggy Alaska day while trying to track down the murderer, Dormer shot his partner--accidentally or purposely, we can only assume, but Dormer certainly covered up the shooting. He only had two problems: a determined investigator in Officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) and the killer (Robin Williams) saw him shoot his partner. What this created was a unique situation where the killer reached out to Dormer to form a pact between the two of them: ""You don't tell on me and I don't tell on you."" What an unlikely alliance, but begrudgingly and alliance was formed.So, how was I torn?I've rooted for Al Pacino in every movie I've seen him in, whether he was good or bad (with the exception of the movie ""Heat."" I wanted De Niro to get away). But in this movie I found myself wanting him to be caught for his cover up and allying with a murderer, while at the same time wanting him to get away with it because he's Al Pacino. It was such unfamiliar territory for me and I didn't like it. In a small way I have to credit writer Hillary Seitz and director Christopher Nolan for them making me feel as torn as I did.I think the movie had the best possible ending. Both Dormer and Walter Finch (Robin Williams) died, and they died by the hands of each other as if they had a blood pact. And Dormer, though tainted, somewhat redeemed himself before dying. Burr was going to throw away the only evidence connecting him with his partners death and he prevented her from that saying, ""Don't lose your way."" It was an ending that I certainly loved as a Pacino fan. He couldn't just walk and I couldn't bear to see him get perp walked. It was the best of all possibilities as he finally got the sleep he so desired at a time in that part of the world where the sun never set.",Insomnia
26,anaconda-40658,I Stayed Awake.,7,9 June 2015,"Insomnia (2002): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan, Maura Tierney: Thriller about the robbing of one's energy through painful circumstances. Al Pacino plays a police detective summoned to a small Alaska town to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. A suspect descends into the thick fog where Pacino accidentally kills his partner. This leads to sleepless guilt and an eventual encounter with the murder suspect who witnessed the incident thus placing him in a difficult position. Director Christopher Nolan previously made intriguing mind bending Memento. Here he uses fog and lighting to indicate Pacino's condition. Pacino is convincing as a man exhausted by guilt and weariness. Is that enough for consequences? Nolan never requests an answer. Robin Williams is brilliant as a psychotic arguing his own reasoning. Is he and Pacino practically within the same position of guilt? If so, then only one feels it while the other suffers it. Hilary Swank's role as a female cop is cardboard and seems only placed there to provide a major female character. She does nothing to move the narrative except provide useless clichés. Martin Donovan appears briefly as Pacino's ill fated partner. Maura Tierney is also featured as a hotel owner but the role is another flimsy supporting type. Endurance of guilt robs its victims of sleep, sanity and eventually life. Score: 7 / 10",Insomnia
27,FlashCallahan,Nolan's wild-card?....,8,2 December 2014,"Sent from the city to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in Nightmute, a small Alaskan town, a police detective accidentally shoots his own partner while trying to apprehend a suspect. Instead of admitting his guilt, the detective is given an unexpected alibi, but this ""solution"" only multiplies the guilt over his partner's death. He's also still got a murder to solve, in addition to the blackmail and framing of an innocent bystander being orchestrated by the man they were chasing.......Made just before fan-boys made Nolan into a pseudo cinema god (believe me I love his work, but Memento aside, his earlier work is ignored), Insomnia may be a remake, but my goodness, the three central performances, and the setting, make this almost unmissable cinema.The main plot is relatively simple, cop accidentally kills his partner, killer sees the act, records his confession, and they strike a deal, but still antagonise each other, but the narrative makes the film all the more interesting, and the guilt factor of this is the fundamental reason why Pacino cannot sleep,the setting just makes the viewer feel that little more disorientated.The film could beset anywhere to be honest, but setting it in a place where it doesn't get dark, gives it all a slight 'The Wicker Man' feel to it.Performance wise we all watch it for Williams playing against type, and while he plays a very scary, but empathic sociopath, one does forget the performance of Pacino.Watching him in the final third always makes me feel a little sluggish, many actors could have gone the way of acting a little inebriated to get the sleep deprived look, but he hits it to a tee, anyone who has ever worked night shifts, will totally feel for Pacino.Its a really interesting interpretation of a highly original movie, and even though it loses its way toward the final ten minutes, it's still a great thriller.",Insomnia

29,mm-39,Very European,9,24 May 2002,"I find European films can be either extremely well done, or done on a low budget; where a quality story is replaced with shock value.(ie nudity and bizarre events)  Much, like today's real life TV where shock replaces a high budget for ratings. I never seen the Swedish version,(it may be Norway, or Finland) of this film, and it must be excellent.  I figure if a producer will spend big money on a remake it will be good like Unfaithful.  The European film story is usually more complex than North American style.  I like this film's story, where the cop gets caught in a pickle, and can not incriminate himself.  This is a story of strings, where bad choices can pull other strings and create other problem.  The killer tries to make himself be like the cop, but he gives clues that this is an untruth.  In the end, another cop is given the same choice, and that leaves an impression on the viewer.  Like Unfaithful one see the ramification of there actions. 9/10",Insomnia

32,JamesHitchcock,Arctic Noir,7,17 June 2009,"""Insomnia"" can be regarded as an example of neo-noir, the type of film which uses modern cinema techniques while trying to capture the spirit of the classic films noirs from the forties and fifties. Other examples of neo-noir include Polanski's ""Chinatown"" from the seventies, Lawrence Kasdan's ""Body Heat"" from the early eighties, or the more recent ""L.A. Confidential"". A 17-year-old girl named Kay Connell is found murdered in a small Alaska fishing town and two Los Angeles detectives Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are sent to assist the local police with their investigation.Dormer, the older of the two, is regarded as a star of the LAPD, responsible for putting a number of major criminals behind bars. He is so famous that his investigations are studied as textbook cases at police academies. Yet he and his partner Eckhart are now themselves under investigation, as the LAPD's Internal Affairs department suspect that they may have been guilty of planting false evidence against suspects.The key moment in the film comes during a stakeout which Dormer has arranged to lure the killer into the open. The operation goes wrong, and the suspect escapes into the fog. In the ensuing confusion, Dormer shoots and kills Eckhart by mistake. As none of the other officers witnessed the shooting, they assume that Eckhart was shot by the fleeing murder suspect, and Dormer does not enlighten them. He knows that Eckhart had been offered an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony in the Internal Affairs investigation. As Dormer was indeed guilty of planting evidence against one man, a murder suspect named Dobbs, Eckhart's testimony could have put him in jail. Given that he had an obvious motive to kill his partner, Dormer fears that no-one will believe that Eckhart's shooting was accidental.Ellie Burr, a young female police officer with the local force, is assigned to investigate Eckhart's shooting. She was once a great admirer of Dormer, whose methods she studied at police college, but now starts to suspect that her idol may have feet of clay and that Eckhart's death may not have been an accident. To make matters worse for Dormer, he is blackmailed by Kay's killer, a local crime novelist named Walter Finch, who knows the truth about Eckhart's shooting. Finch offers to remain silent about this matter on condition that Dormer directs suspicion away from him by planting false evidence implicating Kay's abusive boyfriend Randy.A complex plot of this nature was one of the hallmarks of film noir. Another hallmark was an atmosphere of moral ambiguity, often involving corruption on the part of the police or others with a responsibility for enforcing the law. Dormer is a morally ambiguous character, not altogether unsympathetic despite his wrongdoing. He was led astray not by financial corruption but by his passion to bring criminals to justice; he believed firmly that Dobbs was guilty and deserved to be punished, and that tampering with the evidence was a lesser evil than letting such a man go free. The title is a reference to Dormer's inability to sleep; he blames this on the perpetual daylight of the Alaskan summer but there is a strong implication that his feelings of guilt and anxiety are also to blame. Ironically, his surname is derived from the Latin ""dormire"", meaning ""to sleep"".Watching Al Pacino in this movie is like watching a masterclass in acting. Every expression, every gesture, even the slightest inclination of his head is full of meaning as his character is slowly driven mad by his predicament. Dormer is a haunted, guilt-ridden figure, torn between his desire to do the right thing and his desire to preserve himself and his reputation. Rather surprisingly Pacino did not receive an Oscar nomination for this film. The Academy seem to have lost interest in him in recent years; he has not had a single nomination since his long-overdue ""Best Actor"" award for ""Scent of a Woman"" (which is far from being his best film). He receives excellent support from Hilary Swank as Ellie and from Robin Williams as Finch. It came as something of a surprise to me to see Williams, normally the hero, as a villain. He had played a terrorist in ""The Secret Agent"", but that was a relatively minor role.A third hallmark of film noir was its distinctive visual style, generally marked by expressionistic, moody black-and-white photography. The spiritual ""blackness"" which gives these films their name is often matched by a literal darkness. It would probably be impossible to recreate this look in a modern film, but the challenge for neo-noir directors is to create an equivalent visual style for their productions. Kasdan manages this well in ""Body Heat"", a film whose a colour scheme is dominated by blacks, reds and oranges, emphasising the feelings of heat and passion. (That film, which deals with an adulterous affair, is set against the backdrop of a Florida heatwave).Whereas the atmosphere of ""Body Heat"" is sultry and tropical, that of ""Insomnia"" is cool and Northern. Even though it is midsummer we are always aware that we are in the Arctic. Nevertheless, Christopher Nolan is also able to bring a distinctive look to his film. In some ways this look is the opposite of film noir; while that genre was dominated by night and shadows, ""Insomnia"" is dominated by grey skies, mists and a perpetual pale, milky sunlight. The fog in which Dormer shoots Eckhart can be seen as symbolic of the moral fog of confusion and ambiguity in which the story takes place. The high standards of acting and direction mean that this is one of the better crime thrillers of recent years. 7/10",Insomnia
33,Smells_Like_Cheese,Crafty little thriller,8,19 September 2007,"A few weeks ago my mom and I were watching Insomnia on TV when it was storming out and right as the conclusion was about to happen, the power went out! Don't you hate it when that happens? So I just had to rent this movie and finish it, I just watched it this morning and I have to say that Insomnia was a very clever thriller, almost on the edge of Hitchcock. The plot was so very interesting and also makes you question your own ethics on what is right and what is wrong. It's rare that a movie really does have that kind of effect on you, where you almost wonder if it would be so bad if someone got away with something so terrible. The actors in this film were absolutely terrific in their performances, especially Robin Williams who has proved to many that he can act brilliantly in a drama and now in the thrillers. Insomnia is a clever thriller that I was very impressed with.Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart are two detectives from L.A. who are coming to Alaska to investigate a the fatal beating of a 17 year old girl, Kay. Dormer meets another cop who admires his work, Ellie Burr. Together along with other policemen they find the killer, but he gets away. In the middle of trying to find the killer in the deep woods in the thickest fog, Will accidentally shoots Hap thinking he's the killer. But scared, Will tells everyone it was the killer that shot him, but then Will gets a phone call from the killer and he knows about Hap. Now Will has a chance to get off scott free along with the killer, but it's a question of him being able to live with this horrible secret while someone who's innocent goes to jail for the killer's crime.Insomnia is a great thriller, I was incredibly pleased with how well it worked. Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, and Robin Willaims all did a terrific job of acting, they really clicked and made the film work. I think one of the scenes that really got to me was Dormer explaining to Rachel about his ways in L.A., what he was ""escaping"" from, you'll have to see what I mean. But Pacino does a grade A job of acting in that scene, he made it so effective to where you would question on what you would do in a tough situation. I would highly recommend Insomnia, it's a terrific film, just don't watch it in the middle of a bad storm, the ending might get cut off, lol.8/10",Insomnia

37,sddavis63,Robin Williams Out Of Character In A Movie With Too Many Flaws,3,5 December 2002,"I had been intrigued by this movie from the time it first appeared, largely because I was curious to see how well Robin Williams would handle a straight dramatic role. Simply put, he was all right, but the movie itself was rather weak and uninspired.The first thing I wondered about was the premise. A teenage girl is murdered in a place called Nightmute, Alaska, and the local police department there calls upon the LAPD for assistance, who end up sending two detectives to help out - Dormer (Al Pacino) and Eckhardt (Martin Donovan). They have no detectives in Alaska? I mean I'm sure that murder isn't especially common up there but they had no one who could help? The cities of Anchorage or Juneau wouldn't have had a detective who knew something about  murder investigations? I just thought that whole idea was problematic.Second problem was the characters themselves. Frankly speaking, there wasn't a single likeable character in the whole movie. There was no one to root for. There was killer Finch (Williams), irritating hero-worshiping local Alaska cop Ellie (Hilary Swank) - no wonder they had to go out of state - corrupt Dormer (Pacino) and his squealing partner Eckhardt (Donovan.) Is there anyone here to feel sympathy with? NO!Third problem was the storyline revolving around the title. Yes, Pacino has the right look for a guy who's gone 6 days without sleep. But so what? The movie would have worked just as well if Dormer had been well rested, but we have to have this story about how it's hard to sleep when one first goes to Alaska in the summer because the sun is always up. OK. That's exciting.Anything good about this movie? Well, the opening musical score was quite good and really drew me in (until the movie actually started anyway); it sets the tone quite well for a suspense cop thriller. Problem is there's not a lot of suspense or thrills coming up. And Williams came across well in this very out of character role for him. Unfortunately, it just isn't a very good movie.3/10",Insomnia

It had elements of The Silence of the Lambs and the beauty of Alaska. No one could've played a sleep-deprived cop like Pacino. He already looks 80% asleep in most of his roles. Williams was superb as the incredibly un-clichéd antagonist. His character, writer Walter Finch, was smart, but not brilliant. He actually seemed like how normal people would react if they were, in fact, in his predicament. And Hilary Swank, well, she's been better in other movies, and she's no Marge Gunderson (played by Frances McDormand in Fargo.) Yet, she did what she could and was still entertaining.That all said, the real stars of the movie were the fantastic script and scenery. Gorgeous locales that make you walk in their sleepwalking shoes. Thanks to the screenplay and backdrops, you could feel every ounce of pain that the Detective Will Dormer (Pacino) was feeling. Now, knowing his background and if he's really a good person, that'll take you a bit.A young girl is killed in the town of no sundown in Alaska (this period of the year, that is) and L.A. Detectives Dormer and Eckhart (Donovan) are called up North to assist the wet-behind-the-ears Ellie Burr (Swank) in solving it. Ellie's ecstatic: Dormer's her hero; she's written papers on him and memorized some of his statements. She's also naïve, but not entirely stupid.Apparently both Dormer & Eckhart had left L.A. in the nick of time as they were being investigated by Internal Affairs for some ""wrong doing"" in one of Dormer's cases. Up there, it's not necessarily smooth sailing as Dormer cannot sleep for more reasons than the sun won't go down. As they close in on the killer, mistakes are made, including a fatal one in which the real killer attaches onto.This movie is not perfect, but it's a definite homage to the suspenseful mysteries of the past. Only, this time, it's directed masterfully by one of the greatest directors of all time, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight, Memento.) It does have powerful performances, crisp cinematography, daring dialogue and really human characters that make this one of the most believable cat 'n mouse films to watch. SEE IT!",Insomnia
39,cherold,hackneyed dialogue,5,27 December 2003,"I watched about fifteen minutes of the beginning and was shocked at how wooden the dialogue was; typical Hollywood bad cop movie dialogue.  I gave up when Martin & Al were talking about the internal affairs stuff.  But I wanted to see Robin Williams (having just watched One Hour Photo) so I skipped forward an hour.  It's better at that point, with a low key performance by Williams compensating for Pacino's usual hamminess.  It moves pretty well in the second half, and there are some nice shots from the insomniac point of view.  Not good enough to go back and watch the part I skipped, but good enough to watch to the end.I saw the original a few years ago and know I didn't skip any of it.  I think I found it intriguing and good but not great.  Based on my recollection, I'd say it's preferable to the remake.",Insomnia

Dormer to find a suspect in Kay's murder her on and off again boyfriend Randy Stetz, Jonathan Jackson, who's been known for working her over where she had black & blue marks to prove it. What confuses Dormer in Kay's murder is that it wasn't the crime of passion that he suspected it of being. It was cold and calculated in that her body was washed and her nails clipped as if she was being prepared for burial at a funeral home. Still in him thinking that Randy was Kay's killers leads Dormer his partner Eckhart and the local police to stake out this cabin where they think he hid all of Kay's clothes and personals as a trophy of his grizzly act.With the shadowy killer sensing he's abut to be caught he makes a run for in that in all the confusion Dormer ends up shooting,in the thick fog, his partner Eckhart,to death! Deciding to cover up the shooting Dormer plants evidence at the scene to implicate young Randy Stetz whom he felt was responsible for murdering Kay but didn't have the evidence to arrest or convict him!**SPOILER ALERT from This Point On** What Det.Dormer didn't realize was that Kay's killer local dime store novel detective & mystery writer Walter Finch,Robin Williams, was the one fleeing from the cabin and saw what Dormer did: Kill his partner Hep Eckhart.

Just like he's planning, with Finch's cooperation, to do in setting up young Randy Stetz! What really got to Det.Dormer more then anything else in the movie is the constant and non-stop daylight that after a number of days without sleep starts flipping him out. It's in fact local lady detective Ellie Burr, Hilary Swank, who's a big fan of his who later realizes that Dormer in fact blew Eckhart away by finding a spent shell casing at the scene of the shooting from the gun he had a Walther 9.mm not the one he planted a .38 revolver in Randy's house in order to frame him.

'Insomnia', his follow-up movie, is less tricksy and covers some fairly familiar ground: corrupt cop, pretty female assistant, manipulative psychopath, horrific murder - none of this is especially new territory for film. But in spite of this, 'Insomnia' is every bit as gripping as its predecessor, thanks to some economical storytelling, Al Pacino playing ravaged as only Al Pacino can, the backdrop of some stunning but savage Alaskan scenery, but above all else, through Nolan's wonderfully taut and claustrophobic direction. Some scenes (the chases in the fog, and on the logs) are pure cliché, yet in Nolan's hands they come alive in a way that they fail to do nine times out of ten. Nolan is a clearly a major talent, and with this film, he has proved himself not just an imaginative young tyro, but also one capable of working with a serious budget and major stars. For all the obviousness of the premise, this movie shows how this sort of thriller ought to be done.",Insomnia

'Insomnia (2002)' manages to use its unique setting and unconventional set-up to take the story in unexpected directions.

44,bowmanblue,Nolan's 'training wheels' film,7,29 September 2014,"Right now, most people know Christopher Nolan for his critically-acclaimed Batman trilogy. Others who know a little more about his work link him with some pretty intense science fiction, fantasy or generally twisted movies like Inception, The Prestige and Memento.However, before all of those classics, he did a remake of a Scandinavian film, Insomnia. I haven't seen the original, so I can't compare to that. Although, as it wasn't originally his story, he didn't have as much input on the screenplay as he normally does. It's about a couple of cops from LA (one being the strung-out Al Pacino) who come to a small town in Alaska where it doesn't get dark for six months of the year, to investigate a murdered girl. Enter Robin Williams - the main suspect and Al's nemesis.With those two acting heavyweights, you can never really say that Insomnia is a bad film. It ticks all the boxes. Everyone puts in a decent performance and I can't really see anyone who likes detective-type movies being disappointed. However, when you compare it to Nolan's other work, it does seem like a step down in quality. I can only think he prefers working on his own screenplays. Either way, don't let that put you off. It does the job and it's definitely worth a watch (as are most of Al Pacino's films!).",Insomnia
45,dromasca,Won't Let You Sleep,8,2 November 2002,"This strong psychological thriller drama will not let you sleep. It is intelligent, well-acted and well directed. No wonder that this is a re-make of an European film - they do too little good scripts in Hollywood nowadays. The European public is much more connected to literature, and the lack of big apes and aliens encourages script-writers in Europe to focus more on humans.Acting is superb. Al Pacino is playing a deprived of sleep Columbo, with the emotional depth of a master. Robin Williams decided to break his stereotypes casting of the last years, and the decision seems to be already paying back. I expect more wonderful roles from him soon.The director Christopher Nolan takes a bet by picking a less revolutionary script than in his previous film 'Memento'. He succeeds and I actually liked 'Insomnia' more than 'Memento' - probably human feelings are easier to understand when run in the normal chronological order. It is hard to believe that he is only at his third film, he always has the self-confidence and sure hand of a master. As the titles of his films are all in the Hitchcock tradition, the comparison to the 'Birds' author is striking, and I really hope that the future will prove it as well-deserved.",Insomnia
46,ThomasDrufke,Nolan's Most Underrated,9,5 November 2014,"It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.It seems weird calling Insomnia Christopher Nolan's most underrated movie considering I also think it's his worst film. But saying it's his worst is saying a lot. Insomnia is a brilliant psychological crime thriller that has a lot of the same beats as other police dramas but it definitely has the Nolan flavor along with it. It's about a detective Will Dormer, played by Al Pacino, who is forced to take up a case in Alaska with his partner in order to save his job because of previous mishaps on a case. The case is one of Kay Connel, a fan of Walter Finch's crime novels.As the movie progresses not only does Dormer have trouble sleeping, hence the title, but has to face his inner demons and mistakes he has made that have shaped an inescapable position. Pacino is brilliant in this film and plays well off of Robin Williams, who plays a surprisingly terrifying villain. I think this is another case of the acting in Nolan's films being overlooked. Nolan always creates great material for his actors to work with and puts them in perfect positions, but only one acting academy nomination has ever come from one of his films. I'm not sure Williams or Pacino's performances should have won Oscars but they are definitely under-appreciated.It's hard not to mention Hilary Swank who gives another incredible performance in a movie that she could have easily been overshadowed by two of the all time greats. Insomnia is one of the all time great crime films and I really hope that after Interstellar Nolan moves back into that genre and maybe even brings back Pacino for something. Perhaps something less cerebral than Inception but captures the intensity that Insomnia does, with the incredible characters of The Prestige. Go check out Insomnia and you will be pleased with the outcome.+One of Pacino's last great performances +Intense and thought provoking (as usual with Nolan) +Swank's overlooked performance +Williams creepy villain +Nolan directing a crime film -Ending a bit of letdown compared to other Nolan films 9.3/10",Insomnia
47,g-bodyl,A Great Psychological Thriller!,8,18 March 2013,"Insomnia, directed by the great Christopher Nolan, is a film that shows why Nolan is one of the most gifted directors to take the camera. He creates a film thats different than his other films but still somehow makes this film seem like his own. This is a great psychological thriller that will play with your mind and has some heart-moving twists and turns. People say this is Nolan's weakest film, but this is not a bombastic film like the Batman trilogy or Inception. This is designed to be a quiet ""cat and mouse"" game that affects your mind and only your mind.This film is about a detective, Will Dormer who is flown to Nightmute, Alaska to investigate a murder to a high school girl. Working with the local police, Dormer begins to set eyes on an author Walter Finch. While working on the investigation, he never gets sleep because of the 24-hour light outside so he begins to be affected mind and body and that may lead to some interesting things.Al Pacino and Robin Williams give very strong performances in their roles. Pacino just looks exhausted throughout and that is essential for that character in this film. I would never thought Williams would play a convincing sociopath but he did. I associate Williams with comedy which this film obviously is not.Overall, this is a mind-thrilling mystery thriller that furthered the career of Christopher Nolan into the Batman films. I liked how I had to think about the movie as I do with most of his films and how different it is from those films. This is a quiet film that will silently grab you with it's plot, script, and twists and not visual effects as movies rely on upon today. I rate this film 8/10.",Insomnia

52,The-Sarkologist,Another Nolan Masterpiece,8,31 March 2021,"One thing that I would have to say with this film is that you probably shouldn't watch it if you have to be up early in the morning, namely because when I watched it I suddenly had an attack of insomnia that night, meaning that I was pretty tired the next morning. Yeah, that was rather irritating. Anyway, now I have that off my chest I can now talk about the film.This is a Christopher Nolan film, and one of his lesser known ones as well. The other thing is that it stars some rather high profile actors - Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Actually, it was rather interesting seeing Williams playing a bad guy, especially since I don't know of many films where he takes such a role. Yet, it was Pacino that stole the show, especially the way that he played a character that literally didn't sleep for six days.The story is based on a Norwegian novel, though they shifted it to Alaska instead (even though the part of Alaska where it was set doesn't have a midnight sun, and I suspect that those parts that do the midnight sun doesn't last all that long, and you can generally tell when it is supposed to be night, and when it doesn't). A woman has been murdered, and some FBI agents come up to the small town to help with the investigation. However, one of them is under investigation for manipulating evidence, and his partner has been called to testify. However, during a rather misty period, where they are attempting to track down the killer, he shoots and accidentally kills his partner. The problem is that even though it was an accident, he doubts that anybody is going to believe him.I guess is this one of Nolan's style, particularly since the main character's perception of reality and fantasy is warped by the fact that he has not slept in days. In fact, it is his lack of sleep that is the main driver of the film's narrative. Actually, the statement at the end where he says that he no longer knows whether it is an accident or not suggests that the lack of sleep really does begin to warp one's view of reality. In fact, the way he just becomes more, and more tired is a testament to Nolan's skill as a filmmaker. While it is one of his earlier films, to goes a long way to lay the ground work for some of his later masterpieces.",Insomnia
53,slightlymad22,"Nolan, Pacino and Williams Will Keep You Awake",7,18 September 2014,"The last good movie Al Pacino made (to date) is this movie with Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. It tells the story of two Los Angeles homicide detectives investigating the murder of a local teen, in an Alaskan town where the sun never sets. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Robin Williams is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Pacino brings his A Game for what appears to be the last time, whilst Swank is also on top form. There is something special about Pacino here, that has been missing in most of his work between then and now.Given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this failed to find an audience. Insomnia is a professional piece of work, suspenseful, with a good sense of atmosphere it makes for quality entertainment.

56,zkonedog,"Solid Cop Drama, But Not Spectacular",5,10 March 2017,"I was originally drawn to this film because of director Christopher Nolan. After viewing his Batman re-boots (Batman Begins & The Dark Knight) and enjoying them immensely, I was hopefully that Nolan's other works would provide some of the same. In the case of Insomnia, he makes a much more ""traditional"" film, shrouded in a bit of false advertising to make it seem a bit more mysterious than it really is.For a basic plot summary, the film centers on policeman Will Dormer (Al Pacino), who travels to an Alaskan town to try and solve a murder case. With an Internal Affairs investigation breathing down his neck back home, Dormer is under intense pressure to succeed in this new arena. While teaming with local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), Dormer not only struggles to solve the case, but also gets mixed up with mysterious writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams).On the whole, this movie functions pretty well as a traditional cop drama. It has the murder mystery, the gun shootouts, and the intrigue plot line which questions the integrity of pretty much everyone involved. Without looking for anything more, this would be a very solid film.However, the film is advertised/promoted as so much more than just a cop drama. The title itself indicates that the condition of insomnia will play a big role in the film, but it does not (Dormer not sleeping doesn't seem to add anything to the plot). Robin Williams's role is billed as a taut, psychological thrill-ride, but he doesn't make an appearance until an hour into the movie and even after that point is severely underutilized. Also, Swank's character is introduced as a potential key part in the film, but she (like Williams) just isn't given anything interesting to do.Thus, I can only give this film an ""average"" rating due to its inability to rise above a simple cop drama.",Insomnia
57,Floated2,Great sleeper thriller,8,10 October 2019,"Having seen previous Christopher Nolan films and being a fan of his other work, Insomnia is one of his earlier films in which have yet to watch. As a film, this holds up quite well as a psychological type cop drama and thriller. It starts with the lead roles of Al Pacino and he is very solid as a cop playing a heavy sleeping disorder. Originally not knowing that this film is a remake (which could be the reason for a relatively low IMDB rating, currently 7.2-- in comparison to Nolan's other films) and having not seen the original, but found this version to be quite overlooked in some regards.Though one downsize is that the killer of Robin William's character isn't that interesting at all (as how it made it seem to start) and was seemingly a regular person (not a complete psychopath or oddball). In comparison to the killer in Se7en, this is far more tame. And the reveal of how he lead to the murder wasn't exactly thrilling but simply, as he put an ""accident"". Insomnia isn't such a mystery as one lead to believe, simply because the audience knows the reveal and it was straight forward in that part but more so of a drama.Very much detail seemed to be put in, and there are some key details along the way which make this film engaging. It isn't too quick in pacing but with good acting, good directing, and an intriguing plot, the film is never boring. Although some of the film was quite predictable, the journey along the way is worth the watch. A film in which you will remember immediately following its viewing.",Insomnia
58,johnnyboyz,"Solid film with numerous basic stand out aspects such as acting, cinematography and script but it does do a little more than you think.",7,4 September 2007,"I'm not sure what surprised me more, the fact that this was actually a remake of a Scandinavian film or the fact that deep down, Insomnia is a really smart and classy thriller. There are so many examples of thrillers from recent years that get into a groove of good guy, bad guy, love interest and rely on their special effects and stunts to pull it home. In Insomnia, these things are toyed with a little and what with a few other well made and thought through conventions, it makes Insomnia rather enjoyable.After you get the customary set up which reminded me of The Silence of the Lambs what with the police agent acting as a fish out of water (Academy to the Frontline in The Silence's case  Los Angeles to freezing, backwater town in this case) brought in to track a murderer whilst having the plot involve a rookie female of some sort. What's clever here is that we know as much as the police do from very early on but as secrets and situations arise, the path we go down with Will Dormer (Pacino) is as decisive as it is enthralling. Insomnia is a really well shot film  its use of the Alaskan setting through long, external shots and the way it portrays inside settings as so 'in-between' light and dark are really good. The fact the town he's in is almost always engulfed by light at the time of his visit acts as a fabulous device.Where Insomnia breaks away from the standard thriller is when it toys with the prospect of role reversal. After Dormer gets a call from Walter Finch (Williams) who's assumed to be a murder suspect since it was him running from a set up and it was him who has 'one up' on Dormer for events you'll discover, the film moves into a period of about thirty minutes revolving around Finch proving his 'innocence' that the death was an accident and Dormer becoming more and more besieged by guilt and the blackmail Finch has on him. It's almost as if Finch is now the OK guy and Dormer is the one who has done bad and this is emphasised through the way he sees the world: he's starting to see everything in a distorted manner, he's having to tidy up his mistake by covering his tracks; something a murderer would have to do as well as come up with alibis. He's also failing to sleep at night and at one point is mocked by Finch for 'breaking his record'. This is Dormer entering the killer's mindset and it's done really well, having an interesting spin on things.I suppose the reason Insomnia's such a well made and effective thriller is that its director is Christopher Nolan who pays attention to fine detail. The way the editing becomes a little erratic and you could say 'slack' but I think it's for a reason  heads are in different positions as reverse shots are displayed during conversations (like on the ferry) and it becomes quite abrupt, emphasising the lack of sleep Dormer's had. Like I said, the film does play around with who's 'good', who's evil and who's being pinned as evil when really maybe they're not and Hilary Swank's character of Ellie Burr is perhaps a little more than a supporting character when you think about it. Despite all the manipulation, the 'order' is eventually restored so that felt a little disappointing as I felt the film set itself up nicely for a twist of some sort.Make no mistake, Insomnia is well made and has made me curious as to what the original is like. I can just imagine Stellan Skarsgård running around an icy Scandinavian country dealing with the things that happens in this narrative. For maximum effect, watch the film late at night when you've got that feeling that you just know you'll be tired in about an hour and half but you start the film anyway.",Insomnia
59,filipemanuelneto,A good thriller,7,17 December 2018,"I had some expectations when I saw this movie. Its almost impossible not to create them, when we have before us a film by the prestigious Christopher Nolan, with actors as strong as Al Pacino, Hillary Swank and Robin Williams (the latter - rare case - in a role of dramatic villain). Only later did I come to discover that this was a remake of another Norwegian film, which I never saw.The script is based on a police investigation into a crime in Alaska, where the Sun has the peculiarity of, at the peak of Summer, never to disappear from the horizon. Will Dormer, a Los Angeles cop, goes there, but he's not used to the environment or the white nights, so he cannot sleep. Something that worsens as the remorse for his past haunts the investigation.Nolan is a skilled director with unquestionable ability. However, this movie is far from his best. In fact, if we didn't know that he was in, this movie could perfectly well be any other good American director. But there are moments of brilliance: the way insomnia was portrayed, the way the white Alaskan landscape was used to make the place oppressive, mysterious and inhospitable... The script, in turn (in one of the rare films where Nolan avoided getting involved in writing), has more of a turnaround and can get our attention. Although we know very early on who is the criminal and the great villain, the film focuses on the figure of the policeman, calling into question his way of doing justice, avoiding making him a hero, just as he avoids making the victim an innocent figure. The murdered young woman, in fact, was not a choir girl.Al Pacino was perfectly up to the challenge and along with Williams dominates the entire film. This duo of striking actors is fundamental and was able to do what it took to make their characters strong and domineering. Right behind, we can appreciate Hilary Swank, an actress whose performances have not always appealed to me in other films, but who was very well here.",Insomnia

61,SAMTHEBESTEST,The Most predictable Nolan Film till date.,7,17 November 2020,"Insomnia (2002) :
Brief Review -The Most predictable Nolan Film till date. Watching this film after watching all universally acclaimed Classics of legendary director Nolan is like giving matric examination after passing degree with distinction. Insomnia is the only psychological thriller directed by Nolan and we know he never repeat any genre (except for TDK Trilogy) so this film was meant to have something chilling and thrilling stuff. But like all Nolan films this one lacks power punch in the climax. All i mean is, Insomnia is a Nolan's Film without trademarks of Nolan. The film is about a cop who is asked to solve a murder case but himself commits a crime during the investigation. The real murderer tries to settle his account with him for knowing about this crime committed by the cop. Overall, this is a nice plot except it doesn't explore psychological elements we saw in cult films of 90s. Maybe it was late considering the fact that Holywood had found better ideas with psychological thrillers like 'Silence Of The Lambs' and 'Fight Club' which had real thrilling climaxes. As i see, every Nolan Film had something saved for the climax to blow us away but Insomnia wasn't the one. Specially when it was needed such stuff for being a film of this intricate genre. Insomnia is very good movie and definitely watchable even in repeat viewings and no doubts most of the credit goes to the performances of Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. What it misses is innovative ideas to end the suspense and unpredictability. There was lot of talk about 'Wild Card' in this plot but where was it? I couldn't see anything sort of that. So, Insomnia misses some things but simultaneously adds some small small things to make the overall picture look Great. You know, Nolan had done far better than this.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",Insomnia

He's tired, harboring a multitude of dark secrets and he's good at his job. He's on his way from Los Angeles to Alaska with his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. When they spring a trap on the killer, some thick fog and a mix-up results in Dormer accidentally shooting and killing Hap. Knowing this would be the end of him, Dormer claims it was the killer who shot Hap. The guilt in combination with 24-hour sunlight that far north leads to a number of sleepless nights. Then it really gets intense when the killer (Williams) contacts Dormer and threatens to expose his secret.The dynamic between a criminal and a cop who don't want to work together but must if either is to come out of this mess unscathed is what makes ""Insomnia"" unique. Pacino and Williams come from two totally different acting backgrounds, so their chemistry keeps the tension for much of the film, which is key when the ""whodunit"" interest factor gets thrown out the window rather quickly. The story becomes much more of a drama and the suspense comes from whether they can dupe the local police, especially the naive and tenacious young cop Ellie (Hilary Swank) who idolizes Dormer and his work. The sleep deprivation factor acts as Nolan's creativity license. The story sticks entirely with Frank's point of view, so a number of tactics are employed to create that sleepiness feeling without going so overboard as to drive the viewer crazy -- or to sleep. Objects go in and out of focus and there's obviously a huge lighting factor for cinematographer Wally Pfister to handle. Pacino's performance, however, ties it all together in this way. It would have been nice if the insomnia was less metaphoric and more relevant to the plot, but there's no use trying to turn the film into something it's not. As much as we want murder mystery or something more akin to Nolan's ""Memento,"" ""Insomnia"" is not that kind of film. Despite no wicked left turns in the story, at times ""Insomnia"" is a bit tough to follow. A lot of what's motivating Dormer happened off camera before the time of the story, so some of that crucial information gets squeezed out. The tension and the acting really sell the rest of the film, so these end up minor deficiencies. ""Insomnia"" is one of those rare instances where the talent and the production values really elevate a film that might not otherwise warrant the any serious acclaim.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Insomnia
63,marmar-69780,Insomnia,8,31 August 2020,"Some people consider that Insomnia is Nolan weakest film till date and that it is on level of films like Memento,Dark knight and others....But to me this film is from now one may 4 favourite films of his after Dark knight,Inception and Batman Begins and i even consider this film to be a better film then said Memento cause i clicked with this character far more then the ones from Memento.Al Pacino and Robin Williams were brilliant here and it is hard to decide who of them was the best part of a movie.Hillary Swank was also good here but not on their levels.Insomnia was a somewhat underrated Nolan film that needs far more love then it actually gets",Insomnia
64,Anonymous_Maxine,"You know, I had a pretty rough day today myself.",6,5 April 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is a tiny bit of a digression, but I watched this movie when I was taking a break from cramming for two midterms that I had to take this morning (I watched the movie last night). I had been studying for most of the day and decided to make something to eat and watch the movie for a while to take a break from the books, and right about the time when I realized that Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) inability to sleep was to play a major role in the plot of the film, I fell asleep. A little irony that I found too amusing not to share with you all. Will Dormer is a detective assigned to a case in Alaska about a high school girl who has turned up dead. He finds out early on his mission that he is being accompanied by an agent from Internal Affairs, sent along due to some suspicion about some of Dormer's cases.(spoilers) Dormer immediately finds himself adored by a young police woman in Alaska (I think the name of the town was DeafMute or something) who has studied his every move and all but idolizes him, an adoration to which he tiredly responds with a roll of his eyes. He's seen this sort of thing before, and he just wants to get the job done and get back to Los Angeles and away from all of these backwoods people. The film is a typical investigation film until a great scene where the cops find the victim's backpack and put it right back where they found it, and then announce on the local radio stations that they need the backpack that the girl left a party in, offering a reward. They set up a trap at the location, knowing that only the killer knows where it is so they hope he'll show up to get it.In a great case of police stupidity, one of the officers accidentally presses the button on a megaphone, alerting the killer just as he arrives and setting up a good chase sequence through the fog. This is where the real conflict of the movie is introduced. Dormer accidentally shoots his partner, the Internal Affairs officer sent to investigate him. Knowing that he will be blamed for the murder, he covers it up, making it look like it was the killer that shot him, and thus beginning an increasingly tangled web of lies (have you ever noticed that lies tend to lead to more lies?). We may begin to wonder for the rest of the film how likely it is that Dormer would have been blamed for the shooting had he simply told the truth in the first place. Sure, it would look suspicious since the guy was investigating him, but that is hardly proof of premeditated murder. He would have been innocent until proven guilty, and his guilt is not likely to have been proven beyond what was obviously an accident.The movie ultimately teams up Dormer with the original victim's killer, Walter Finch (played by Robin Williams in a decidedly uncharacteristic role), who also may not have had such malicious intentions in the first place. Dormer crosses the line of the law when he decides not to tell the truth about how his partner died, and now he is going even further by teaming up with the killer to frame the girl's boyfriend for the deaths of both victims. This forces us to question a lot of assumptions that we take for granted about authority figures and criminals in modern society.We assume that the police are there to protect us (although, we should always keep in mind the famous and all too true quote from some source that I don't know beyond the Skinny Puppy song that I heard it in, `The police used to watch over the people, now they're watching the people.'), and that they are the good guys out to catch the bad guys. In this case, assuming that Finch is telling the truth about what happened, the bad guy is not necessarily a bad guy (although certainly not the most admirable character), and the good guy, the police officer, is even worse than the bad guy because he's trying to frame an innocent kid of murder.This also brings up another point, however, since the kid is also not the most admirable character. The movie not only makes us examine our assumptions of authority and criminals, but also of ourselves as we find ourselves hoping that they succeed in framing this kid, who we dislike enormously because of his inflammatory temper and his tendency to beat his girlfriend, who sought the company of the man who killed her in order to get away from him. In that way, he certainly played a role in her death. He was definitely not the most nurturing guy in the world.Will Dormer is the main character in the film, charmingly named because of his inability to sleep, which is undoubtedly brought on because he certainly has a lot on his mind. He has been assigned to find the killer of a high school girl, he has inadvertently shot and killed his partner who was investigating him for Internal Affairs, he finds himself identifying with the criminality of the suspect that he is trying to bring in, his own plan of covering up his own murder is falling apart, and all of this is taking place in a location where the sun never sets. No wonder he can't sleep.Up to this point, this is a great psychological thriller. There is relatively little action put together to add up to an enormous amount of tension, but this conversely makes you wonder about some scenes that seem to have been thrown in just to have a little more action in the movie, when next to none was needed. There is, for example, a scene where Dormer chases Finch across a lot of loose logs on a river and ends up getting trapped underwater, which is one of the more tired action sequences of the thriller genre. This scene stands out so far from the tone of the rest of the film that it seems to belong in a different movie.But more importantly than that, the movie really starts to fall apart at the end when Dormer and Finch turn against each other and the movie devolves into a typical shootout. This is the point where the film lets us know that these two characters were trying to put a plan into action that could never work, they were on a doomed path. So don't try this at home, kids. The whole set-up of the interaction of Finch and Dormer falls apart into low-rent action, which reminds me of the ignored opportunities of Hollow Man and, even more, the similarly obligatory ending of the recent Robert DeNiro film 15 Minutes, which was a tremendously well-made film with a conclusion that is just as much on auto-pilot as this one is.We get the nice poetic justice as the two major criminals in the film shoot each other simultaneously, and Dormer is given a chance to do a deathbed conversion, redeeming himself in the eyes of Ellie Burr (the young policewoman played by Hillary Swank who admired him at the beginning but eventually discovered his secret), urging her not to throw the one piece of incriminating evidence into the river but to turn it in so this whole sordid mess can finally be resolved. Very nice, but this convenient ending just doesn't do justice to the effective tension created in the first half of the film. Like the two main criminals, the ending is almost a polar opposite of the beginning, leaving us enormously entertained but eventually disappointed.And in case you were wondering, both of my midterms today went remarkably well.",Insomnia
65,jzappa,Standard Fare But With Interesting Themes,10,17 September 2008,"On one hand, when you see Insomnia, you've seen it all before. On the other hand, there is a theme that makes it fresh and entertaining rather than a wasteful rehash of scores of other cop thrillers about catching a tricky murderer in a small town. The story takes place in a small Alaskan fishing town where a local teenage girl is found murdered. An LAPD detective played by the inimitable Al Pacino, along with his partner, are sent up to lend a hand in the investigation, working with an eager local rookie played by Hillary Swank, still crisp and unpolluted by her job. Now, at the same time, a severe Internal Affairs inspection back in LA is inevitably going to put Pacino under a tornado of scrutiny and indictments. And he is, indeed, guilty of planting false evidence against at least one suspect in an earlier case. He worries that a lot of of his legal convictions will be annulled if Internal Affairs learns the truth. He does not want his life's work ruined, nor does he want these offenders released. Early in the movie, his partner discloses that Internal Affairs has proposed an immunity deal in exchange for his testimony. Pacino tries to talk his partner out of it, but he, seemingly complicit in some way in Pacino's crimes, says that at the end of the day he has to take care of himself and his family first, so he thinks he has no choice other than to agree to the deal.All through the film, Pacino grows to be increasingly unbalanced because of shooting pains of shame over another big cover-up that occurs when he concocts a shrewd scheme to bait the killer back to the crime scene, and angst on account of the menace of being exposed. Swelling his disorientation are the phone calls he gets from the killer, who does not distinguish himself, but who knows of Pacino's regretful deed and about his effort to conceal it. This is the reason, yes, but from the moment he arrives in this small town, his entire biology is confused by the perpetual daylight of Alaskan summer.How much longer can he lug this load of liability? How would he normally if he were not in a place so out of his element in so many ways? How intricately can one function if an essential bodily purpose is not met?Robin Williams ascertains his bona fide acting chops in this film, not only because it is a serious role as a villain in a thriller but also because the amount of control he is capable of having over himself, allowing himself to subordinate to a story that does not entail him playing himself. Whenever he plays a serious role, he does show just how multifaceted and complex he is not only as an actor but as a person all around. His villain actually projects that unpredictable sudden adjustments from one moment to the very next.This enjoyable thriller is not on par with Christopher Nolan's fascinating previous film, Memento, but in his helming of it he does show that he can make an effective film if he subdues himself and refusing to give in to experimental progressions of nonlinear storytelling or elaborate twists and other plot elements that don't do much but telegraph how clever he is. Insomnia was a chance for him to sharpen his skill with atmosphere and the power of hiding. And what a cool atmosphere this movie has, a dismal snow-covered town of only a handful of people, almost like a dream.",Insomnia
66,FiendishDramaturgy,Effective cat and mouse.,8,1 October 2003,"Very effective cat and mouse psychological thriller. Nice suspense even WITH Pacino.I'm not a fan of Al Pacino's work. I haven't really liked but 6 or so films he's ever done, so I didn't have high expectations of this movie. That, combined with my fore-knowledge that the copy I had skipped and fluttered, didn't have me on the edge of my seat to watch it.I watched this movie as a test study, actually. I watched this movie as a test study concerning the possible worth and watchability of the upcoming new release of Batman (Batman 5). Since Chris Nolan is listed as the director of this new undertaking, I thought I would check him out.I must say that I was delightfully surprised. This is a wonderful cat and mouse ""time is running out"" suspense with twists and turns you never expect.I found it unpredictable and edgy. Williams always struck me as the type who would do this genre quite well. I'm happy to see him spreading his wings beyond comedic/character acting. This could be the beginning of a whole new career for him. Quite honestly, I hope so. I have felt for some time that his style of comedy had just about run its course. Way to go, Robin Williams! It must have taken great courage to try a movie like this, after all these years of comedy/dramas. Hats off.I will not outline the plot here. Everyone else does that and I find it tedious after a while. But I will say that if you like a good suspense, a dark quirky cat and mouse, this is the movie for you. Excellent remake, as well. That is indeed a rarity.And in conclusion, I feel that if Chris Nolan devotes the same level of darkness and atmosphere to Batman 5 that he did to this movie, he just may save the series and kick-start a whole new run of (hopefully) good Batman movies. Here's hoping.It rates a solid 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Insomnia
67,bsmith5552,Interesting Murder Mystery!,7,2 November 2002,"Contains Spoiler ""Insomnia"" is the story of two L.A. detectives who are ""sent"" to a small town in Alaska to help solve a grisly but methodical murder of a teen aged girl.Detectives Will Denner (Al Pacino) and Farrell (Larry Holden) are under investigation by Internal Affairs, so their chief spirits them out of town to assist a small town police chief (Paul Dooley) in the above investigation. Officer Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) is assigned to assist the detectives. Farrell in an effort to save his own skin tells Denner that he will in effect sell him out when they return home.In pursuit of the murderer in a dense fog, Denner shoots and kills Farrell. He is not sure in his own mind whether or not the shooting was accidental or not. Complicating matters is the fact that because Denner is in Alaska at a time when there is 24 hours of daylight, he is unable to get any sleep.To further complicate matters the murderer identifies himself to Denner as mystery writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams). It seems that Finch witnessed the shooting and is now threatening to blackmail Denner unless he backs off the case and lets someone else take the fall. Denner after ten days is becoming exhausted with little sleep and is unable to think clearly. Meanwhile Officer Burr is investigating the case on her own and comes up with some interesting findings.The main part of the film is the cat and mouse game going on between the Pacino and Williams characters. Pacino is great as usual and it is interesting to see the portrayal of his character's gradual exhaustion due to insomnia. Williams, in a change of pace, doesn't appear until well into the story, but is very good as the creepy self-confessed killer. Swank has little to do to show her talents but makes the best of her role.An interesting murder mystery.",Insomnia
68,BeneCumb,"A bit slow, but with strong cast",7,19 November 2012,"It is a pretty for-certain success when/if you combine sense issues with a middle-of-nowhere landscape which provides additional vacuity and thrill; Iceland, Canada, Scotland are the best known locations. In spite of the events going on in Alaska, the movie was shot in British Columbia, i.e. Canada.Christophen Nolan is fond of mystery movies running their course - and Insomnia is no exception. At times the scenes are too long and only thanks to Al Pacino's excellent performance you won't yawn or longing for the imminent end... Robbie Williams and Hilary Swank are also worth watching but they spend much less time on the screen than Pacino. And a nice ""supporting actor"" is the landscape and background...I have not seen the original Norwegian movie, but the one in question can still be recommended. Especially for those who like Pacino and Williams - you won't be disappointed.",Insomnia
69,freemantle_uk,Excellent Psychological Thriller,8,13 August 2009,"Christopher Nolan and Al Pacino are both are masters of their craft, and it great to see them working together. Insomnia is the best film Pacino has done since Heat and Christopher Nolan's first Hollywood, allowing him to re-boot Batman.Set in Alaska during the summer of 24-hour daylight, a 17-year-old girl had been murdered in a small town. LA police detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) have been asked to help the small town investigate. Both are experienced detectives, friends with the police chief and they are being investigated by Internal Affairs in their native city. Whilst investigating Dormer sets out to find the evidence, know every thing about the victim and match the information to a suspect. He quickly finds out that her boyfriend was abusive (the local bad boy), she had a fallen out with her best-friend and received expensive gifts. After setting a trap for the murderer goes wrong an officer is injured, but worst of all Dormer shots and kills Eckhart. It's seems to be a tragic accident but Eckhart believed it was deliberate. Dormer blames it one the killer. Now Dormer has a 3 way challenge, to find the killer and battle his mind games, cover up him killing Eckhart which is being investigated by a talented young officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) and battle the affects of guilt and insomnia.Insomnia is a clever, tight thriller, with themes about guilt, psychological damage and the grey world of right and wrong. Nolan handles the material with skill and keeps the audience guessing. He slowing builds the jigsaw. Some pieces are obvious, some more subtle. You find out who the killer is pretty early, like in real life the prime suspect is normally the killer. But this is a film about mind-games and the affect of insomnia and guilt. Nolan keeps the film going and keeps it under 2 hours. The writer and director does a good job handling the multi-layered, but interlinking plot so you don't get lost in the film.There are excellent actors in the film. Al Pacino is brilliant, as he normally is. He is best actor in the film and his character has some similarities to his character in Heat. He about to show the mix elements of the character, but still makes him sympathetic. Robin Williams shows he can be a good, serious actor, but his performance in One Hour Photo was better. Hilary Swank is also a good actress in this film. There were no weak links in the film acting wises.My one criticism of the film is it was a bit too Hollywood, reminding me of Silence of the Lambs. I wanted something a little less conventional. But it is still a good movie.If you like Insomnia I personally recommend Se7en, Heat and Zodiac.",Insomnia
70,dfranzen70,Sleepy-eyed Pacino well met,7,7 June 2002,"Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is a Los Angeles cop who is sent along with his partner to a rural Alaskan town to investigate the murder of a young girl. While chasing a possible suspect, however, Dormer accidentally shoots his partner, with whom he had had a recent argument, in a dense fog.  Rather than admit his own guilt, though, Dormer tries a coverup, thinking that no one could know what really happened. But someone did see - the man Dormer and his partner were chasing.What follows is a taut cat-and-mouse game. Walter Finch (Robin Williams) knows what really happened in the murky fog, and he'd like to help Dormer cover it all up - but for a price. And in addition, the shooting of Dormer's partner is also being investigated, separately, by a novice detective named Ellie (Hillary Swank), who idolizes the veteran cop. Something's got to give - Ellie's a great young mind, and it'll only be a matter of time before she figures it out, right?Every movie, save for the mindless, faceless action films, must have some kind of hook for the audience, something to make it unique. In this case, it's the fact that Williams is playing a bad guy - an atypical role. And it's a great role for him, too, as he does a fine job getting to the meat of the character. Pacino's got a good character to play as well - think Serpico - and he's at his best while underplaying thinking man's roles (okay, I'm not forgetting his younger, wilder days as Michael Corleone, but his best work as a pure actor are with these roles). Add in the beautiful Alaska scenery and the fact that it's light out for much, much longer periods than it is for those of us in the continental U.S., and you have quite the setting for a modern film noir, so to speak.The title comes from the fact that Dormer simply can't sleep after he's accidentally (or was it an accident?) shot his partner. He's haunted by images of his dying partner; racked with self-doubt, he also has trouble sleeping because of the endless light in Alaska, resorting to taping his shades closed and placing objects in front of the window to make it darker. And because of his inability to sleep, he becomes very strung out, unable to think clearly.This movie is from the director of Memento, which was a fascinating film noir in its own right, expertly written and directed. Because Memento was so good, I did have higher hopes for Insomnia. Insomnia isn't nearly as good as Memento, but it's still a very well done, intriguing psychological thriller with an excellent cast.",Insomnia
71,meeza,Nolan is Masterful!,9,26 May 2002,"The grandiloquent directors of our time have the niche to implement a certain theme into masterful storytelling. One of them is Director Christopher Nolan. No one could forget his ingenious direction for last year's sleeper hit `Memento'. He has done the same for this year's unsleeper hit `Insomnia'. If you forgot, `Memento' focused on a short-term memory loss amnesiac who utilized mementos devices such as inscribed tattoos and polaroid photographs as aids to his disability in order to solve a murder mystery. In `Insomnia', it focuses on an insomniac detective who uses his crafty police-work and his masterful discretion as aids to his disability in order to solve a murder mystery. Al Pacino stars as the restless detective. His performance should open the eyes to academy award voters during oscar time. The godfather of all actors proves once again why there is not a challenging role he can't refuse. I was quite `alarmed' to see Robin Wiliams playing the heavy; but he was quite impressive as the sadistic psycho. Also, Hilary Swank does deserve accolades for her role as the junior inquisitive police officer. However, the true light of the film that opened my eyes widely was the innovative direction of Christopher Nolan. This 32 year old brit is one of the best bright minds of theatrical filmmaking. So see the light at the end of the tunnel (or at the end of the movie theatre line) and see `Insomnia' today! ***** Excellent",Insomnia

His character also finds himself in a game of outwitting the suspect he is attempting to capture played very well by Robin Williams. In perusing Williams, Pacino makes a couple decisions that Williams takes advantage of partially due to Pacino's lack of sleep during the endless light in Alaska of Summer. Will Pacino nab him in the end or let him slip through his fingers to protect himself from his bad decisions?

73,jimbo-53-186511,"Part crime drama, part psychological thriller - not Nolan's best work, but it's decent enough",6,16 July 2014,"LA detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to assist in an investigation of a murder in a small town in Alaska. Dormer and Eckhart are assisted by rookie officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank). This particular homicide case is far from straight forward as the killer has taken many precautions and does his best not to leave any clues - this in part is down to the killer being a 'crime writer' so it kind of makes him an unofficial expert. Dormer is starting to piece the puzzle together, but there is an unfortunate twist in the tale which forces Dormer to co-operate with the killer. Will Dormer be able to get his man whilst also managing to keep his reputation and integrity intact? I'll admit that this film was a little slow to get moving, but there were several things working in its favour. Firstly, there is the great chemistry between Al Pacino and Martin Donovan. Pacino can do this sort of acting role in his sleep (no pun intended) and his reputation really does proceed him. I'm not quite as familiar with Martin Donovan, but he was good and the back and forth between him and Pacino was top drawer. The film is also interesting from a scientific perspective - there is a scene in the film where they are discussing going to school to interrogate a potential suspect and one of the Alaskan officers says ""we can't go now it's 10 o'clock"" and Dormer says ""So what""? The Alaskan officers then inform him that it is in fact 10 o clock at night even though it is broad daylight outside - this isn't a plot hole btw. This is known as 'The Midnight Sun' and is witnessed in parts of Russia, Finland and Sweden and Alaska - it only occurs during the Summer months. I believe that the original film was set in Norway where the same phenomenon occurs.Insomnia starts off as a Crime/Mystery film and it does maintain this theme throughout the film. However, once Walter Finch (Robin Williams) is introduced the film switches tone and becomes more of a psychological thriller. I liked the change of tone and found the psychological mind games that Finch plays with Dormer to be very entertaining and somewhat creepy. Williams is great in his role as the psychologically disturbed Walter Finch. It's not often that you can say that Al Pacino ends up being 'out acted' but I really felt that Williams stole the show. Pacino was still good, but Williams excelled in his role.Unfortunately, whilst this build up was good and Williams character was both disturbing and interesting I just found that once all this was established the film didn't really have anywhere to go. Insomnia plays its hand early by revealing that Finch was the killer - in some ways I liked it because it proved to be engaging and an extremely good psychological battle of wits. The downside of this is that it also made the film far too predictable - why couldn't there have been a few suspects throughout the film in order to keep the audience guessing? There were no plot twists and far less suspense than there could have been. Insomnia felt very clinical and by the numbers with very few (if any surprises).Even though Insomnia is a film with lots of flaws, it is still a good film and is worth watching (but more for the psychological aspect rather than the crime/mystery aspect). I only realised that this was a remake after I'd watched this version so having enjoyed the remake I'll be sure to check out the original.",Insomnia
74,sauravjoshi85,"Great acting by both the legends, good execution, little less satisfied with the climax",8,30 May 2021,"Insomnia is a thriller movie directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Al Pacino, Late Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan, Nicky Katt, Paul Dooley and Maura Tierney.The movie which is a remake of 1997 Norwegian movie of the same name has an interesting plot and good execution, the movie is undoubtedly Star studded movie with superb acting the only thing which doesn't satisfies me is the ending as it seems the regular Hollywood movie ending and Nolan's touch seems to be missing.Acting is superb Pacino is one of the greatest stars and this movie shows why is he regarded as one of the greatest star of his time, he had done an immaculate acting. Late Williams is a powerhouse of talent and had done surprisingly well in the negative character, he had shown that a great actor can't be stereotyped in particular roles and can play any character. Working in the shadow of two legends and still getting you highlighted shows the talent you possess and same goes for Hilary Swank. Despite of two legends she had make her presence felt. Rest of the characters were also good and impressive.Screenplay of the movie is evenly paced and doesn't looses the grip, there are not many twists in the movie but still the movie runs on it's constant pace, cinematography is beautiful and locations are been captured nicely. I am little less satisfied with the climax as the typical Nolan touch is missing from the climax probably it was a remake and Nolan doesn't wanted to make any changes in the script.Overall this is a nice entertaining movie and should be watched for the great acting by the leads.

75,juneebuggy,Atmospheric thriller. Robin Williams does a great bad guy,7,11 February 2015,"A good thriller this one, atmospheric, taught and keeps you guessing. I sure do like Robin Williams in these roles as the bad guy, (also check out One Hour Photo) he is so good, creepy in an understated way. Al Pacino gives a great performance here too, conflicted, stressed and slowly unraveling from lack of sleep. I think his character stays awake for 6 days and it was fascinating to watch him try to cover his expanding pack of lies while going crazy. (Director) Nolan sure likes to torture his leads in unique ways.Insomnia takes place in a remote Alaskan town where, because its summer the sun doesn't set. Two Los Angeles detectives are dispatched there to investigate the homicide of a young girl (why, I'm not sure). Hilary Swank plays an impressionable young officer who meets their seaplane -I liked her here, trying to impress Al Pacino as the folklorish cop hero.While apprehending the suspect Al accidentally (?) shoots his partner and then covers it up, giving the lurking Robin Williams killer character blackmail ammunition against him. These two have some great scenes together, cat and mousing their way through the second half.The scenery is beautiful here, unique especially if you don't know better as I found myself distracted at times by Squamish (B.C) posing as Alaska with shots of the Chief, the mill, Chieftain pub, Britannia beach etc. A good thriller. 2/9/15",Insomnia
76,noralee,"Not As Good as Original, But Still A Good, Dark Tale",8,30 November 2005,"I erred in giving into temptation to watch the original Norwegian ""Insomnia"" on IFC just a couple of weeks before seeing this Hollywood re-make directed by indie-credible ""Memento"" Christopher Nolan with a very effective Academy Award-winning cast.The original movie had a tiny budget and also an excellent cast, led by the terrific Swede Stellan Skarsgård, growing as pale as that relentless sunshine during the course of the film; the usually haggard-looking Al Pacino interprets his insomnia visually through an ever more haggard face.Though the original film isn't given as the source material until well into the closing credits, this follows the main thrust of the story closely. The changes, though, are both subtle and significant and intriguingly as American as Sam Spade when the mise en scene gets moved to Alaska (actually shot in Vancouver). Significantly, there is less sex and more morality.Hilary Swank's character is more naive than her counterpart; Martin Donovan's character's role is more central to the story and, of course, Robin Williams gets more screen time than his original counterpart, as the conflict is less in the lead's mind and more on the screen as a duel. The plot twists are done differently so I shamefully got confused between the two movies.While not as overwhelming as the original, I do think this version should rank right up with the great detective/cop-does-the-right-thing movies, and the plot makes more sense than ""The Big Sleep.""(originally written 6/16/2002)",Insomnia

The one time he hit the road in a straight line is Insomnia, a fairly standard cat and mouse thriller given the obvious boost of having Chris at the helm, as well as two actors who get dangerously out of control, in the best possible way. Al Pacino plays Will Dormer, an L.A. cop who treks out to small town Alaska to solve the mystery of a murdered local girl. The twist: they're in the region where it's daylight for a month straight, and if that's something you're not accustomed to, it'll throw you way off. It's fascinating to watch Pacino roll in sharp as a razor and completely in control, then observe his lack of sleep eat away at the frills of his perception and start to play tricks on his weary mind. The film has one of those narratives that gives us a heads up as to who the killer is nearly right off the bat, in this case personified by Stephen King esque novelist Walter Finch, played by a vastly creepy Robin Williams. He and Pacino do an eerie dance through the foggy local geography and small, gaunt townscape, Pacino looking for clues and proof while trying to hold onto his sanity, and Williams unnervingly playing a macabre mind game, perhaps only for his own amusement. There are shades of Vincent Hanna in Pacino's work here, the extremely stressed out LA detective from Michael Mann's Heat. One gets a sense of the same world weariness and feral ferocity of that character, especially in a heartbreaking monologue to the local innkeeper, played by underrated Maura Tierney, who is brilliant in the scene that requires her mostly to listen, a much harder task than delivering any page of dialogue. As for Williams, he's never really done anything this specific before. I mean, he's played freaks and villains all across the board, but none quite like Walter Finch. He's detached in a way that still clings to a humanity he may have lost through so many years writing stories that only happened in his head. He's both dangerous and rational, and when those two are fuelled by emotional trauma... watch out, because there's damage to be done. There's further work from Hilary Swank as Will's partner, Nicky Katt, Emily Perkins, Martin Donovan and edgy Vancouverite Katherine Isabelle, who just excels in anything, here playing the murder victim's troubled best friend. Now, this film is based on a chilly Swedish thriller of the same title, starring Stellen Skarsgard in Pacino's role, and Williams nowhere to be found, naturally. I connected with Nolan's version far more, the original seeming rather bland and lacking personality, but it's got a huge following and a Criterion release, so what the hell do I know, go see for yourself. I do know that nothing stands up the hairs on my neck quite like the portentous back and forth between Pacino and Williams here, the icy inaccessibility of the central mystery and the feeling that there's always something bubbling just below the surface of a seemingly civilized interaction. Barring Memento, which even rose to flights of fancy, this is the most down to earth Nolan has ever been in his exploration of the psychological landscape. Dreams, outer space, damaged memory and morality are for another day here. It strips away any of that, leaves it's characters stranded in a misty, threatening environment that mirrors their own starkly layered perception, and sits back to observe. Rats in a maze of the human mind, if you will. It's an important film in Nolan's career for this very reason; a departure from ambitions grandiose in nature, a vacation from fantasy, and a forceful glimpse at two men with minds holding on by just a thread, like a spider's web, beaded with dew in perpetual sunlight that refuses to set and give them solace. A masterwork of tension, with few instances of release.",Insomnia

80,MarieGabrielle,Stand-out performance for Robin Williams....,9,3 November 2007,"and also newcomer Jonathan Jackson. This film is an excellent suspense and atmospheric thriller.Based in Unkumiat Alaska, Pacino plays world-weary Detective Dormer, who has been sent on a sabbatical by LAPD to solve the murder of a high school girl. Hilary Swank is also believable as young aspiring detective, who at first admires Dormer. Al Pacino is excellent (as usual) he seems to assimilate a NY or Los Angeles detective incarnate at this point in his lifelong career.The primary indelible performance, however, is Robin Williams. He has played so many comedic and fluff roles, but this genre is something I wish we have seen more of him in. He is menacing, strange and unfamiliar, threatening to the audience. The camera explores another side of him which the audience rarely sees. This is a most interesting performance, and I hope that he will explore more of these roles, he is clearly a gifted and versatile actor.Jonathan Jackson also deserves mention as a young arrogant student, initially a suspect in the homicide.If you like Williams in this, rent the DVD of ""One Hour Photo"" directed by Saul Rubinek. Williams again excels in a villainous role. 9/10.",Insomnia
81,aidanratesmovies,A Good Film- no doubt- but not without its slower moments,9,8 September 2020,"A taut, sleek, and well acted thriller- Insomnia is a more than decent remake that makes the best out of its cast and source material, to make for a slow, but ultimately very interesting thriller. As always, I praise Nolan for his direction in this film. There is no one I feel would be more fit for directing it. The writing in the film seems to drag a bit at parts, with its pacing even slowing to a crawl, but I still find myself enough invested into the story and characters to keep going- and i'm glad I did. Al Pacino gives a fantastic performance in the lead role in this film, and i'm very glad it was him in the role, rather than previous casting choice Harrison Ford, as I feel his performance in The Fugitive would undermine the whole film a bit. Hilary Swank is also very good in her performance, but the true game changer in this film is Williams, who isn't afraid to try something drastically different from his usual roles- and surprisingly succeeds so very well at it. I did feel the film could have been about 15-20 minutes shorter, but luckily it kept me engaged just enough to enjoy it, which is good, considering all the great talent this film provides and is involved with. In the end, Insomnia is not Nolan's best by far, but a good remake and a good film- nothing more, nothing less- and sometimes that's all you really need.
My Rating: 9/10",Insomnia
82,Agent10,A dark ride in the subconscious,8,24 May 2002,"Following up a movie like Memento must be quite a chore, but Christopher Nolan did his best. Insomnia is more of a focus on photographic technicalities, allowing the more mainstream viewer to experience Nolan's dark and cryptic style of focusing and cutting. But then again, Insomnia isn't just about cinematography, it's about the nature of human beings and their passion for the truth. Al Pacino portrays the troubled cop Will Dormer to a hilt, letting his natural wrinkles and facial expressions become a natural prosthetic. While the dialogue was simple and direct, the entire history of the characters could be told in the first few minutes of the film. Hillary Swank and Robin Williams' characters had very little history or motive, but then again, their stories are not as important as Dormer's. However, such a miscue in storytelling leaves a hollowness to the picture, turning everyone into a fickle backdrop for Dormer's troubles. Overall, the story was well put together, and executed by the numbers. While David Julyan's score was good, he should have sought to stay confined within his bounds as he did with Memento and Following. 8/10",Insomnia
83,Boyo-2,"Where its always light, there is darkness",8,27 June 2002,"Excellent telling of a fairly uncomplicated story, none of which I will re-tell here.  Partly because I still have questions about it all and partly because I am not sure what I saw, but I mean that in the best way possible.
All three stars deliver the goods, but Pacino is in his zone and for my money, hasn't been this good in over a decade.  Robin Williams is also excellent in a role he was probably not offered immediately, but he handles it all very well.  Its not that his acting ability was ever in question, but when you play the bad guy, there are a couple of ways you can do it, and a lot of them are bad.  Hilary Swank is just a talented actress who can do a lot more than parts like this, but she was excellent as well. I could see why all three wanted to be involved in this project.Out of the supporting cast, I enjoyed Nicky Katt (he tells a very funny joke toward the end), Maura Tierney and Martin Donovan. Paul Dooley is there in the beginning and then not so much at the end.Jonathan Jackson, who I enjoyed in 'The Deep End of the Ocean', basically has one scene, but he makes it count.The movie is edited to the skies but that's also a good thing.  Its especially effective near the end, when you want Pacino to sleep so bad that somewhere I bet people are throwing valium, blankets and Teddy Bears at the screen.  You feel exactly like he does, or when you feel when you're just about to fall asleep, but wake up suddenly, with a shudder.  That the editing can communicate that is worth mentioning.Beautiful cinematography and worth seeing on a big screen for the scenery. Top work by all involved.  8.5/10.",Insomnia
84,Boyo-2,Darkness where there is much light,8,28 June 2002,"Really excellent, thoughtful and intelligent thriller.  Its been blessed with some top acting talent, all of whom have another meaty role to add to their resumes.  Even the supporting actors are in tune with the movie.
Do not want to give away any plot points, nor am I positive I'd be able to. Its not that movie is confusing, but its strange in that I am not sure what I saw, exactly.  Movie has a weird mood to it and I can't think of anything else like it.Pacino has disappointed me recently, but he's back in top form here. Robin Williams took a difficult role and made it his, and he is excellent also. Hilary Swank makes the most of her role and her best scenes are worth waiting for.  Nicky Katt and Martin Donovan and Paul Dooley are also in the movie and all very good as always, and Katt even gets to tell a pretty funny joke near the end.  Also enjoyed Jonathan Jackson, who I thought was very good in 'The Deep End of the Ocean', and Maura Tierney, who each have one or two scenes.Movie is edited to the skies and that is also a good thing.  Near the end, when Pacino is screaming for a break, the editing makes you feel like he does.  By then you want to throw a valium at the screen to give Al some relief.Cinematography is excellent and the location where the movie is shot offers many picturesque views.Christopher Nolan is a top talent, and I can say that even though I didn't care for 'Memento' at all.

85,Jonny_Numb,cinematic school of the drooping eyelids...,6,7 October 2005,"In ""Insomnia,"" director Christopher Nolan and his cinematographer have a knack for schizophrenic edits that disorient and surprise with regularity, putting a fine accent on an otherwise unspectacular police procedural with delusions of a deeper moral core (some aspects of which work quite well, to an extent). Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (an appropriately somnambulant Al Pacino) is sent to the small city of Nightmute, Alaska to investigate the murder of a young girl, but accidentally shoots his partner while in pursuit of the murder suspect; throughout the rest of the movie, Dormer is racked with guilt (which reveals another transgression years before) and is unable to sleep. He forges a bond with the girl's murderer, an author played with a too-controlled earnestness by Robin Willaims (whose dark side was displayed much better in ""One Hour Photo""), and these two actually wind up showing a multi-layered morality and depth that is mature and endearing. However, too many unnecessary plot threads run through ""Insomnia,"" and the script frequently resorts to repetition to pad things out (and at nearly two hours, the movie is already overlong)details about different guns and bullets and who possesses what winds up less clever than confusing; similarly, a boyfriend character is given little personality and just serves as a convenient plot device to take the killers' fall when the third act rolls around. And, after a fairly satisfying buildup in its first half, ""Insomnia"" unravels the closer it comes to the endinstead of the action and suspense tightening, it becomes as lethargic as the sleepless Dormer, to the point where a shootout ending is inserted (which, despite some subtle closing irony, pretty much jettisons the pains the film took to be cerebral) to wrap up the plot in a crowd-pleasing way. Removing the fog of amazement many critics had toward Nolan's ""Memento,"" ""Insomnia"" is a sophomore effort that's rather thin beneath the surfacea cinema stunt that too infrequently rises above convention.5.5/10",Insomnia
86,davidmvining,Well built thriller with a less than stellar ending,7,26 January 2021,"It's weird watching this in the middle of watching Twin Peaks. Both are about out of town lawmen coming to an out of the way small town in the heavily wooded parts of the American northwest to investigate the murder of a high school girl whose body had been dumped, naked, in plastic bags. The lawmen stay at lodges, and there's even a use of the name Leland. Based on the Norwegian movie of the same name, Christopher Nolan's Insomnia, at some level, feels like the more literal version of David Lynch's surrealistic exploration of a murder. But enough about that, how's the movie?Al Pacino is Will Dormer, a soon to be disgraced Los Angeles robbery-homicide detective who's been sent to Alaska to help the local police department investigate the murder of Kay Connell. With him is his partner, Hap, who is considering cutting a deal with Internal Affairs that will throw Will under the bus but save his own skin. Will, convinced that if they just maintain a strong front, is disgusted and disappointed in his partner's willingness to give in. With the local police, they find Kay's backpack and let out a message to the community that leads the killer to try and reclaim it at a remote cabin in a rocky and foggy location outside of town. In the confusion, Will accidentally shoots and kills Hap who dies convinced that Will did it on purpose, and the killer witnessed it all.The movie gets its title from the fact that the remote Alaskan town of Nightmute is above the Arctic Circle and has no nighttime that season and Will cannot get any sleep in his well-lit hotel room at the local lodge. That he cannot sleep means that he cannot forget the pressure he is under back home, the guilt he feels for shooting Hap, and that he's being squeezed by the Kay's killer, the local author Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams. This feeling is sold cinematically through over-exposed images, cross-cutting to previous moments, and blurring sound design as Pacino's performance because more and more strung out. He often looks, in the latter parts of the film, to be struggling to simply keep his eyes open and focus.All of this is solid stuff. Pacino is good. Williams is understated and creepy as Finch. Hillary Swank is eager as the young Detective Ellie who gets tasked with writing the report on Hap's shooting. Everything is cleanly filmed in a professional manner, and the sequence in the fog is just the right combination of clear and murky to give us solid perspective into a hard to discern situation. The appearance of Williams provides an interesting level of menace, and Pacino's increasing desperation as he loses more and more control of the situation is played really well.I suppose the only thing holding me back from appreciating this film more is the ending. It's not that I don't like to see flawed protagonists relearn the correct values. It's that I'm not sure I buy Will Dormer following through to the end. You see, Dormer, at a certain point, gives up on getting out clean with any hope of also getting Finch held responsible for Kay's murder. So, he drives to Finch's cabin in the middle of the country to kill him with Ellie having coincidentally gone at the same time to collect a piece of evidence for the Kay murder, Finch having come forward at Dormer's insistence because there was no hiding the fact that Finch and Kay had a previous connection. Finch, the very careful murderer, accidentally leaves out the dress Kay was in when he murdered her, leading Ellie to figure out in a split second that he did it, even though, as far as we know, the police never knew what dress Kay had been wearing and it was well known that Finch had bought the girl clothes. The meat of the final confrontation is built around this realization that feels thin at best. So, Dormer has to save Ellie, who's also figured out that Dormer did in fact shoot Hap in a solid piece of movie detective work, kill Finch, and, as he lays dying due to a shotgun blast from Finch, insists on Ellie letting the truth out about Hap's death.Now, I've seen the original film, and it ends very different with the Dormer analogue getting away clean. That's not necessarily what I want from this American version, though. My criticism isn't because this takes a nicer route than it's progenitor, but that it's a combination of too convenient, too thin, and too clean. Ellie being there at the same time feels almost like a distraction. Ellie figuring out that Finch is the killer feels too easy. Dormer wanting to just kill Finch feels like the right move for his character, but using his dying breath to accept responsibility feels like a step too far. There's nothing really wrong with this ending, but I suspect there's a superior, more interesting on in a previous draft of the script.Overall Insomnia is a finely crafted thriller with a strong central character at its core. It's the sort of thing one might expect from an up and coming director given a decent budget in order to try and prove himself. The personalities involved in front of the camera were probably too strong for the young Brit to fully control, so he corralled them effectively. He made something safe to prove that he could operate in the system, reminding me a bit of Orson Welles' The Stranger, though Nolan and Welles would go on to have vastly different careers.",Insomnia
87,Seraphion,A nice new twist for a detective story,7,21 August 2014,"I saw The Machinist before this movie and I think I found some similar stuff. It's nice to see a crime and mystery detective movie that's not so gloomy despite the obvious mood building aimed for it. The story depends largely on the twist since the main element reveals itself quite early at the mid section. The insomnia part is greatly incorporated into the story. The background on how it occurs is well explained on the minor details. The depiction is also so vivid, using all those weird focus photography and scene flashes and stuff. Yet the effects are so dominant on the way the main character thinks. Despite there's no real surprising plot twist, there's a decent twist on the ending that's quite worthy to look out for. I like how Hillary Swank can muster up a decent performance to balance Al Pacino's great name and performance here. It's quite regrettable for me that Robin Williams didn't get more in-frame duration sine he too can get a balancing performance facing Al Pacino.",Insomnia
88,eric262003,Excellent Remake Of A Norwegian Thriller,9,2 August 2015,"Set in the isolated Alaskan village of Nightmute where daylight and darkness is split six months apart, ""Insomnia"" tells the tale about the murder of a young girl and assigned to the job are Los Angeles Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan). Looking frazzled and weary once getting off the plane, Dormer knows trouble awaits him. With internal affairs determined to end his career, the idea of solving a murder in the Alaskan middle of nowhere has gotten this grizzled veteran things can't get any worst. Or can they?Feeling that all hope is lost, his junior Detective Eckhart is more than propelled to tell internal affairs only to put the old man out pasture with them blackmailing him with immunity much to the chagrin of Dormer. They fly into Nightmute via two-engine prop plane they are assisted by a relatively rookie cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) who's still a bit lacking in experience as a cop. Following the box office success of his first film ""Memento"", director Christopher Nolan goes out of his way to make this 1998 Norwegian remake of the same name by Erik Skjoldbjaerg. The original film, for a psychological drama it is powerful, intense and quite heavy-handed in details. This one is is no exception. What's different from most remakes is that ""Insomnia"" doesn't just lazily redo every scene from beginning and end but instead re-evaluates it making this movie original in its delivery. Pacino's approach seems to be taking his role in a more physical approach as opposed to Stellan Skarsgard's character from the original film. How much more does this man have to endure? The surprise twists really comes to life once the third acts comes into fruition which includes a character we don't really expect coming at us. Like both films, the development is very important only this version fans out quite better as an added bonus, it has more dimension.Unlike the Norwegian version, this remake revised by original writers Skjoldbjaerg and Nickolaj Frobenius along with scriptwriter Hilary Seitz, the killer comes into the story under a low-prolific way as sort-of a quiet sidekick to Det. Dormer. By now people may have totally overlooked the fact that Robin Williams was in this movie. Here he plays Walter Finch, whom he doesn't admit of being a murderer, even though it was barbaric and violent. Hey, we all slip from time to time don't we? We all deserve a bit of redemption now don't we? Dormer remains restless in a village that barely sees sundown feels like he'sin a precarious situation. By arresting Finch, Dormer will be victim of his own cover. Dormer believes something scheming is going on. It's obscure that a thriller focuses on moral issues and feelings of shame and guilt, but Nolan doesn't ignore Hollywood requirements that all thrillers doesn't end in an epic shoot-out near the end. There are some memorable exciting scenes like chase across the floating logs and another where a character is drowning underwater. It may be exciting, but was it necessary? Not while the psychological elements are very high I just don't think high-flying action was really needed in this calibre of a film. Wiiliams and Pacino have great chemistry with each other and the reason for that is because Det. Dormer can visualize his visage to his antagonists in a sea of self-deception. The two contrasting characters are what character-studies are all about. Here we see Dormer, over-whelmed, fatigued, sporting dark circles around his eyes and just lacking in composure. While Finch is the smooth operator here as a guy convinced of his own case. Along with ""On Hour Photo"" which also was previewed at the Sundance Festival that same year, really shows that even though throughout most his career, Williams starred in mostly comedies, he is also quite able to play dramatic roles quite convincingly. Why Nolan took the liberty to direct this remake was that ""Memento"" was truly a one of a kind. Attempting to make another film like that could be tiresome. ""Insomnia"" is film that shows even crime can happen even in the most remote places in the world making this film all the more original. It also shows that many eyes are onto Pacino's character, no matter where he is, paranoia is everywhere leaving him with very few to trust and few to seek reassurance.",Insomnia
89,philip_vanderveken,What if they had chosen De Niro or Edward Norton to play the role of Finch?,7,21 June 2005,"Before I wanted to write a review, I didn't know it yet, but apparently this movie is a remake of a Norwegian movie, made 5 years earlier. That's something I don't really understand about Hollywood: Why do they always have to make remakes of European and Asian movies? Is it because they can't bare the thought that someone else might have come up with an idea for a movie that actually worked or is it because they believe that no-one will have seen the original version and therefor will believe that the remake is actually an original movie? I don't know, but I find it quite sad actually. Still, if it is a good movie, I can see past that... The story is situated in Alaska this time. When Detective Will Dormer is sent from the city to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaskan town, he accidentally shoots his own partner while trying to apprehend a suspect. But instead of admitting that he shot the man, he uses an unexpected alibi. But that doesn't make it easier for him, it only adds to his guilt and makes it almost impossible for him to cope with his emotions. Add to this the fact that he can't sleep because of the midnight sun, the murder case that needs to be solved, the investigation that has been opened against him, some blackmail and framing of an innocent bystander, orchestrated by the man they were chasing and you know that it is all getting much too big to handle for one man...I can't say that I had ever heard of Nikolaj Frobenius or Erik Skjoldbjærg before, but they sure know how to write an interesting script. The story is nice and there are enough twists to keep you guessing until the end about who actually did it and once you know that, why he did it. But if I had been the director of this movie I would have chosen another actor for the role of Walter Finch. What Robin Williams did with it, certainly wasn't bad, but I believe that a man like Robert De Niro or even Edward Norton might have been better for the role. Somehow I don't see Williams as a man capable of what he does in this movie. Still, that doesn't mean that the quality of the movie is low or even average. No, this is definitely an enjoyable thriller that offers some very good acting, beautiful decors, a good story... I liked it all and that's why I give this movie a 7/10, maybe even a 7.5/10.",Insomnia
90,screenman,Starring Al Pacino,8,1 August 2010,"With Little Al topping the leaderboard no movie is ever gonna be a dud. And once again he does his stuff. The movie has an unusual mix of leads, with Pacino playing a seriously flawed cop who shoots his partner in a way that may or may not be accidental. He then tries to cover it up - which clearly is deliberate. Unfortunately, the villain - this time played by stereotypic nice-guy Robin Williams - sees him do it, and a curious relationship of mutual secrecy bonds between them. Williams does the creepy-psycho thing so well I'm surprised he hasn't been called upon to do it more often. Here, he plays vulnerability with an oleaginous edge that is enough to make you shudder. When not murdering, he's a crime-writer; so he knows all about crime. Hilary Swank plays an Alaskan rookie detective. She brings a nice mix of trust and suspicion to her role.Most of the action is set in big old Alaska during the time of midnight sun. Hence the title of the movie - Pacino's detective can't sleep in the endless light. Quite why is unclear. They have pharmacies up there. And a good shot of local red-eye will send any weary soul to the sack. Certainly I never experienced any problems.It's a decent if rather formulaic who-done-it, which we soon know. Then it becomes a psychological thriller. We've seen it all before. Flawed cop, flawed villain; one means to be good but fails, the other means to be bad and succeeds. The rest is dressing. There's some nice views of Alaska's big outdoors, but even here a lot more could have been done. Greater use could have been made of the tremendous scenery to emphasise the cop's sense of isolation and the littleness of his purpose. An encounter or two with wildlife would have contrasted with human aggression, and so on.Still, it's a solid work with interesting cast. I thought the clumsy shoot-out at the end a bit of an anti-climax after so much intellectual scheming. But there you go.Definitely worth a watch, but not exactly collectible.",Insomnia

The slow pace and sudden outbursts of violence and anger make a fine balance for the well-known story of a small town murder. The stellar ensemble of Al Pacino, Hilary Swank and Robin Williams make this strong film a mere feast for eyes, and the breathtaking nature serves as a cold, but magnificent background for the wild human passions that are on display here. Alaskan views are almost a main character of the movie, adding with their cold detachment to the merciless out weaving of the events. It is incredible to see how people live and work in this ever-sunny polar day spell of time, which makes it terribly hard for Pacino's character to get by. He is suffering and we feel it. This is a cool example of Al's excellent acting and he makes it very naturally and very smoothly.

94,bandw,A cut above the typical crime drama,7,12 May 2012,"The story has L.A. detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhardt dispatched to Alaska to help solve a brutal murder of a young woman. Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who regards Dormer as one of her heroes, is tasked to work with Dormer and Eckhardt. With that setup I was expecting the usual police procedural but the plot thickens early on when we learn that Dormer and Eckhardt are being investigated by the L.A. Police Department for some shady dealings regarding a previous case. And Eckhardt confides to Dormer that he is about to cut a deal that would implicate his partner, a confession that Dormer does not take with gentlemanly grace.Things get interesting when, in pursuit of the murderer in a heavy fog, Dormer shoots Eckhardt. Did he do it on purpose, or was it an accident? Complications ensue when Burr starts to smell a fish when investigating Dormer's story of the shooting. I liked the concept of the investigator being investigated. When the murderer, Walter Finch (Robin Williams), senses that Dormer is getting hot on his trail he preempts the pursuit by calling Dormer and saying that he has seen the shooting of Eckhardt and can use that for blackmail. The cat and mouse game that Finch and Dormer play is well scripted and engaging.The main thing that separates this from average are the deep insights given into Dormer's psychology. The confusion in his own mind as to whether he purposely shot his friend Eckhardt makes him a haunted and guilt-driven man. His situation is almost identical to that of Gene in ""A Separate Peace"" after having caused harm to his friend Finney. Dormer's behavior in the case that he is being investigated for in L.A. also weighs on him. With the death of Eckhardt he has no one to unburden to and having the need to talk about his past he finally tells his story to the woman who runs the hotel where he is staying. This may be a plot device in order for the audience to know just what Dormer is being investigated for, but, given his state of mind, it is believable.Pacino does an admirable job in portraying the gradual decay of Dormer's mental health accompanied by his slide into total exhaustion due to insomnia precipitated by being where it never gets dark. Robin Williams is a standout in the role of the bad guy. The thing that makes his portrayal so chilling is his calm confidence and seeming detachment when talking about his crime. The contrast between him and Dormer sets up a nice contrast. Hilary Swank is good in playing the young enthusiastic detective. All together a good cast.The final fight and shoot-'em-up scene was at odds with the restrained tone of the rest of the movie. I was not aware of the Norwegian original before having seen this version. Many people point to that as being better, so that is encouragement to see the original.",Insomnia

This is done in a professional way.Especially by the actors. Not by Al Pacino however, who is very overestimated and has been playing nearly the same role through his whole career (one is rather tired of him), but by Hilary Swank and Robin Williams. After seeing Swank in ""Boys don't cry"" you will always have high demands on her, but Williams is surprisingly enough forming a complicated character here, which wasn't to be expected.A little too much shooting in the end.

What is guilt? Does the end justify the means? What is a good cop? What is a bad one? Someone already said that a good cop is the one who solves more crimes than those he commits himself. This is all what this movie is about and the story evolves in the beautiful and almost unreal landscape of Alaska in summer when there is no sunset and insomnia seizes bodies and minds. The first images are terribly ominous showing an almost unwordly landscape seen from the air and they are made even more ominous by a music sound track of heavy and overwhelming density and sullenness. Al Pacino is great is the role of the super-detective who nevertheless has got his Achilles heel and what a big one. Robin Williams on the contrary seems not very much at ease in his first role of a villain. Anyway this is a good movie and in my opinion much worth to be seen.,Insomnia
97,tomsview,Afraid of the light,8,6 September 2013,"Al Pacino stars in a film that features sleeplessness as a central motif. It is perfect casting. Pacino doesn't just look tired in this movie, he looks positively whacked. But he stays awake long enough to bring to life a sharply written thriller with some unexpected twists.""Insomnia"" is based on a Norwegian film of the same name. The Hollywood version, directed by Christopher Nolan, relocates the story from Norway to Alaska. It is not a scene for scene remake although the basic story and a number of key scenes are retained.Legendary homicide detective, Will Dormer, Pacino's character, arrives in a small Alaskan town. He is accompanied by his partner, Detective Hap Eckhart, played by Martin Donovan. They have come to investigate the murder of a young girl. The local police and a young patrolwoman, Ellie Burr, greet them. The enthusiastic Ellie, played by Hilary Swank, is aware of Dormer's fame.Swank's character is pivotal as she realises that all is not as it should be with Pacino's character. The detectives are under investigation by internal affairs, and have come to Alaska to try to work through their problems. Dormer is troubled by the perpetual daylight of the northern latitudes. Swedish actor, Jonas Engström, played Pacino's role in the Norwegian version – but Pacino looks the tiredest! Together, the local cops and their LA counterparts investigate the crime, and a number of people come under suspicion including Walter Finch, the character played by Robin Williams.Prior to this, Robin Williams had been in some particularly cloying movie roles. However, he changed his image by playing a number of edgy and psychotic characters. Williams quickly makes the role of Finch his own and any lingering identification with the Robin Williams from ""Patch Adams"" serves only to create a genuinely unsettling character.The US version gives more of a back-story to Pacino's character and his relationship with Detective Eckhart. This gives some explanation as to why Dormer does what he does. Ellie Burr's character is also more developed than the role played by Tanja Lorentzen in the Norwegian version; Swank is far more engaging.One scene that has more edge in the Norwegian film involves a dog in a crucial piece of evidence tampering – the Norwegian version is wince-inducing to say the least.Chris Nolan's team had the earlier movie as their starting point and could easily see where the story could be strengthened. However, Hollywood remakes of European films often fail to measure up, take ""The Vanishing"" for example; the ending in the U.S. version is a cop-out compared to the Dutch version.The US version of ""Insomnia"" also stumbles at the final hurdle, opting for a more predictable ending than the ambiguous one of the Norwegian film. The Norwegian version is also able to claim the artistic high ground as the totally original work.",Insomnia

99,DeeNine-2,Compelling,8,17 January 2003,"This finely wrought remake of the Norwegian film of the same name (1997)--an excellent film by the way--is something close to a thriller masterpiece flawed only by a too-hurried resolution. Christopher Nolan, whose strikingly original Memento (2000) is among the best films made in recent years, planned this out very carefully, tying up most of the loose ends without relying on any phony motivation, which we sometimes see in passionate cop dramas. However, the guns blazing at the end was a cheap way out of this psychologically complicated story. Still, I think we can overlook that small fault since the rest of the film is so very well done.The incomparable Al Pacino gives a mesmerizing performance as Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who is sent with his partner north to Alaska ostensibly to help in a murder investigation. However we quickly learn that being out of town may help him and his partner avoid an Internal Affairs investigation to which Dormer may be vulnerable. By the way, ""dormir"" in French means ""to sleep,"" which is something Dormer does not do for six days, which is very close to the edge of human tolerance. Indeed Dormer's last line in the film is ""Just let me sleep.""Pacino is supported by Robin Williams as Walter Finch, a morally-deranged mystery writer who doesn't appear until the film is about half over. He makes up for keeping us waiting with a dramatic performance that will curl your toes. He is even more despicable than Bjorn Floberg was in the Norwegian film. Not only is Robin Williams's appearance subtly altered and his demeanor strange, even his voice is not the same. He is a long way from Good Morning, Vietnam (1987) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), but I think this is, in a more modest way, one of his best performances.Also featured is Hilary Swank, whom you should see in Boys Don't Cry (1999) if you haven't, as Ellie Burr, an ingenue Alaskan detective in awe of the master cop from the big city. Notable in a modest role is Jonathan Jackson as Randy Stetz, a high schooler with a chip on his shoulder. I also liked the brief appearance by Katharine Isabelle, who played the murder girl's trampy girlfriend.The key psychological question in both films is why does Will Dormer decide to cover up the accidental shooting? In director Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 1997 film the answer is human nature. That certainly worked, but was not enough for Nolan, and so he gives us Dormer's Internal Affairs problems back in L.A. as further motivation. This works very well for two reasons: One, it is convincing. Recall his spontaneous confession to the hotel clerk (Maura Tierney). And two, the cop problems in Los Angeles are right out of the headlines of recent years. They are real. Nolan even has Ellie find a copy of the Los Angeles Times with one of the stories on the front page.The next psychological question is, is the villain a serial killer in the making? If he is, then Dormer must stop him regardless of his own problems. And therein lies the internal conflict of the film so well projected by Al Pacino. We know that there is something more than the midnight sun to account for Dormer's disintegration. He is a flawed cop. Like some of his real life counterparts in L.A. and elsewhere he took it upon himself, by falsifying evidence, to administer justice to a man he knew was guilty. When he did that, he knew (and this is something he teaches Ellie) that he had lost his integrity as a cop. The temptation to frame somebody we know is guilty of a horrendous crime is very great and many of us would fall into it.Since I cannot discuss the ending here in any concrete way, let me just say that if Nolan had really taken his time with the ending he might have had Dormer simply murder the villain and face the consequences (or even commit suicide). But I suspect Nolan believed that the heroic character of his star would have been compromised. In Skjoldbjaerg's film the police detective actually shoots the dog to obtain the spent bullet he needs. In Nolan's film the dog is already dead. I think this minor blush of character actually taints Nolan's film to some small degree and leads Nolan down the path to the Hollywood ending to come. But judge for yourselfOne final point. A lot can be gotten out of a single camera shot. This is something that Nolan does very well. A case in point is the shot on the plastic evidence bag holding the bullet that Dormer picks up in the lab. Nolan has the camera show us the words on the bag, ""chain of custody,"" and he has the camera linger long enough for us to read them. This nice touch reminds us that THAT very chain of custody is being compromised, another echo of real life criminal investigations from recent years in L.A.See this for Al Pacino, at his best here, one of the great stars of our era whose ability to command the screen is second to none.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

I liked Al's performance, weary and with a week's worth of luggage underneath each eyeball, but Al, we need to do something with your hair. I found my concentration on Al's hair spoiled the movie for me. For one, it varied in colour a lot, salt and pepper, then more salt, then back to jet black, then teetering to a brownish red. And the hair pieces were another story, moving around his forehead in various degrees of thickness but mostly good matches for his vari-coloured hair. And he is getting a bit long in the tooth to believe the sprinting runs and underwater near-drowning scenes he has. The scenery was stunning. Hilary's performance was great as she slowly starts to understand what is really going on. Martin Donovan did not creep me out for once. The plot was great but suffered from the old cliches of senseless chasing and lots of shooting. It should have been more intellectual in concept but I guess we have to please the masses.

101,sme_no_densetsu,Not a bad thriller but could've been better,7,29 November 2008,"""Insomnia"" is a thriller that has some big names attached to it: Al Pacino, Robin Williams & Hilary Swank; all designated as 'Academy Award Winner' on the movie poster. Director Christopher Nolan is also well-known, though his only Oscar nomination is for a co-screen writing credit.The story concerns a veteran cop (Al Pacino) sent to Alaska along with his partner in order to aid in a murder investigation. Through a series of events cop & killer (Robin Williams) eventually come face to face, though under circumstances that pit them against each other in a battle of wits.The cast, as previously noted, is stocked with Oscar-caliber talent. However, it seems to me that those casting the film went for big name actors over others who may have been better suited to the parts. I have no complaints about Al Pacino as he's played this sort of character enough times to be able to do it in his sleep. On the other hand, Robin Williams just didn't convince me as a murderer in the usual Hollywood 'criminal mastermind' mold. Hilary Swank was decent enough but her role demanded none of the skill that won her two well-deserved Oscars. The movie makers should have skipped Swank's price tag and spent the money on better support because most of it is merely television-caliber.The script is a pretty good one if you like thrillers of this sort, although it's been done to death by now. Nolan's direction throws in some admittedly breathtaking outdoor scenery while the more intimate scenes are no better than average. The score by David Julyan is decent enough but I can't really recall anything particularly interesting or memorable about it.On the whole, the film is a perfectly acceptable thriller though it falls into the trap of placing more emphasis on stars than story. However, I expect that fans of the genre will not find it difficult to overlook the supposed faults that I've outlined.",Insomnia

103,Screen_Blitz,"Insomnia is both original and thrilling, and soars with great writing",8,23 July 2016,"Insomnia does not mark the first time director Christopher Nolan uproots a highly original concept and brings it to life on screen, nor does it mark his last. With the astonishing success with the innovative neo-noir thriller 'Memento' the previous year, it was easy to see Nolan had a solid career ahead of him. He's a man who's makes decent acquaintance with originality, from powerful story lines, to absorbing characters, to enthralling thrills for audience to feed on. This psychological thriller starring acclaimed actor Al Pacino, Hilary Swank, Martin Donovan, and Robin Williams in a role unlike any of the charismatic characters he's swallowed in his career; showcases a true and fascinating demonstration of what Nolan is capable of, even if it's quality leads less memorable than his other efforts. The film enters the 'Scarface' veteran Al Pacino as Los Angeles homicide detective Will Dormer who's assigned on a case with his partner Hap Eckhart (played by Martin Donovan) to investigate the murder of 17-year old girl Kay Connell in a small town in Northern Alaska where the daylight sustains uninterrupted for two months. The continuous daylight interferes with Dormer's ability to sleep, leading his insomnia that soon pays a toll his mental state during the investigation. When his attempted apprehension of the killer (played by Robin Williams) goes wrong, it pins Alaskan detective Ellie Burr (played by Hilary Swank) on a separate homicide investigation while Dormer struggles to catch the criminal as he must fight against the psychological deterioration.This psychological thriller isn't your average catch-the-villain story, Christopher Nolan presents the story with gripping psychological elements associated with suspenseful resonance. The story doesn't dwell on typical crime component like shootouts and tense car chases, instead it showcases a brooding psychological character study as it ventures through the main character's struggle in capturing the antagonist from his mental degradation including the symptoms such as hallucinations and impaired physical functions associated with his disorder. This illness plays a key role in the plot, and the film doesn't go out without a fair plethora of thrills. Christopher Nolan drives the plot through a stylish execution that awards viewers with plenty of tight-on suspense and awe-inspiring thrills from start to finish. Very rarely is there a predictable moment. If there is anything that comes more surprising than the twists and turns sprinkled throughout the 119 minutes, it is the confound performance by Robin Williams as the manipulative (yet somehow likable) primary antagonist. Though Al Pacino serves as the pinnacle of the story, Williams comes to the biggest surprise as playing a character on the opposite side of the moral compass, far from the good guy roles many are used to seeing the fine actor in. He makes great memorability for a character with a sinister and complex agenda. Al Pacino and Oscar- winner Hilary Swank are both solidly appreciable in their roles. Nothing surprising but certainly nothing to ignore.Insomnia is an inspiring and captivating psychological thriller with ingenious performance, engrossing thrills, and a smartly executed plot formulated by the efforts of director Chrisother Nolan. The film is more than just a reminder of why Christopher Nolan is such an influential filmmaker he is today, it is a thriller with both inventiveness and smarts that defined a true cinematic arks of it's genre.",Insomnia
104,pyrocitor,Nolan's entrancing detective thriller,8,22 June 2007,"Crime thrillers are becoming increasingly popular in today's movie industry, to the point where each new entry seems almost redundant - we've seen this story before. So it's nice to see an addition to the pantheon of detective murder mysteries with an inventive addition to its loose formula - the lead character, sent from Las Angeles to Alaska to investigate the murder of a young girl is unable to sleep for many days in a row, and begins to doubt his own judgment, and eventually sanity. This slight tweaking of the formula is what makes Christopher Nolan's Insomnia all the more compelling - a particularly captivating and thought provoking take on the genre. If there is a single current director who has been able to generate a steady quantity of relentlessly impressive work with no sign of a decrease in quality, it's Christopher Nolan, whose credentials include the fantastic Memento, Batman Begins and The Prestige. While Insomnia is by no means Nolan's strongest work, that's not to say that it isn't still a compelling and captivating film, and Nolan demonstrates his usual flair for pouring genuine cinematic heart and soul into his film, rising it above the ranks of would be imitations. Nolan shows an uncanny eye for selecting effective settings and locations for his story, and the vast, barren template of Alaska is a perfect choice for the quiet yet turbulent investigation. The use of the insomnia effect for Pacino's character proves particularly effective, as the audience shares in the character's extreme disorientation through blurry camera work and lightening quick editing, capturing a surprisingly accurate cinematic portrayal of the character's dangerous sleep deprivation. While the screenplay, adapted from the original Norwegian film and composed by newcomer screenwriter Hillary Seitz, does allow for the occasional very powerful and emotional moment, for the most part, the film's script is what ultimately prevents the film from becoming a true classic - the dialogue coming across as a touch too contrived and clunky to make for a fully satisfying work. It's a small complaint though, and the film does boast a genuinely unpredictable ending, and enough satisfying moments to overcompensate for the occasional clunky bit. The film also boasts some very succinct and to the point cinematography, shot mainly in close ups of the leading characters talking, and surprisingly rapid fire editing cuts, creating a feeling which does succeed in being deliberately disorienting, adding to the feeling of unease created throughout, though the editing does toe the line of becoming distracting at times. Altogether, the atmosphere created in the film is superb, perfectly complimenting the ominous murder mystery storyline. The always reliable Al Pacino is in familiar territory as beaten down yet determined detective Will Dormer, yet he is allowed to flex his dramatic muscles more here than in a more standard variation of the role. In particular, Pacino demonstrates particular skill in portraying a man suffering from chronic insomnia, culminating in a powerful and affecting leading performance. Robin Williams gives an intriguing and very strong performance, playing strongly against type and arguably stealing the show as the ominous lead suspect for the murder case. The only real casting misfire is Hillary Swank, whose character comes across as simply unnecessary for the most part of the film, and Swank's performance doesn't help - her earnest upcoming cop generally comes across simply as irritating rather than idealistic and passionate. Character actor Martin Donovan also gives a potent performance as Dormer's partner, who is also sent down to investigate the murder. All things considered, Insomnia comes across as a mostly fresh and innovative entry into the near exhausted genre of police murder mystery. Fueled by strong performances from Pacino and Williams, and the relentlessly classy directorial hand of Christopher Nolan, it's easy to overlook the occasional script stumbles, making for an entertaining, tense, and thought provoking film easily worth a look. -8/10",Insomnia
105,seymourblack-1,"A Psychological Dual In ""The Land Of The Midnight Sun""",9,4 December 2013,"The unbearable pressure experienced by a veteran cop during his short stay in ""The Land Of The Midnight Sun"" is charted in detail in Christopher Nolan's impressive remake of the 1997 Norwegian movie called ""Insomnia"". This well-written and very tense drama shows how a toxic combination of guilt, fear and self-doubt torment the detective and undermine his physical and psychological health to such an extent that he soon starts to hallucinate and becomes increasingly unstable.LAPD Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Detective Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are temporarily transferred to the small town of Nightmute, Alaska to help out with the investigation of a brutal murder that's proving to be very difficult to solve. Dormer's expertise is immediately apparent during his examination of the victim's body, as he picks up on some significant points that were obviously missed by the local police and the previously slow progress of the investigation soon accelerates.Dormer sets a trap for the killer who quickly realises that something's wrong and escapes into the fog behind a remote cabin. After chasing the suspect across some rocks, Dormer sees a figure through the fog and shoots but is then horrified to discover that he's actually killed an innocent man. He later tells his local colleagues that the innocent man had been shot by the murderer and some evidence that he plants supports his story.The local detective that Dormer works most closely with is the young and immensely enthusiastic Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) who, by coincidence, had studied some of his past cases during her time at the police academy. She sees her time with him as an opportunity to observe the way he operates and further enhance her knowledge of police work.The murder victim was a 17-year-old schoolgirl who it's discovered, liked the books of a local crime writer called Walter Finch (Robin Williams) and when it later becomes clear that they were secretly friends, Finch becomes the prime suspect. The dynamic between the determined homicide detective and his prime suspect had already become untypical however, after Finch had contacted him to say that he'd witnessed his crime in the fog and from that point on, the mind games had begun.Will Dormer is under pressure from the time he arrives in Alaska because he knows that his previous cases are being re-examined by Internal Affairs officers who suspect him of tampering with evidence to get convictions and his disloyal partner is willing to betray him to try to save his own career. Being under the constant threat of losing his career, his livelihood and his reputation is a constant worry and when he also has to grapple with his conscience about the man he accidentally killed, his anxiety becomes difficult to bear. The fear of his ""crime"" being discovered (either by information from Finch or by the investigation that Ellie's undertaking) is terrifying and to make matters worse, the perpetual daylight in his new surroundings makes it impossible for him to sleep.Al Pacino does a fantastic job of showing the mental and physical deterioration that his character goes through and Robin Williams, in one of his more restrained performances, is quite chilling as the manipulative and very creepy murderer who claims that he, like Dormer, actually killed as the result of an accident. Hilary Swank is also outstanding in her part as a smart but naïve officer who learns some important lessons and is discouraged by Dormer from making the same mistakes that he made.""Insomnia"" isn't a conventional thriller as the identity of the murderer is revealed at a relatively early stage of the movie and it doesn't contain many action sequences. What ultimately makes it so absorbing, however, is its account of Dormer's torment, his moral ambiguity and the psychological dual that he engages in with Finch.",Insomnia
106,antoniotierno,suspenseful and gripping,8,15 March 2005,"It proves an intelligent and involving film; Al Pacino's acting alone would deserve any kind of prizes. Pacino is simply stellar, brilliant, never conky. What starts out as a physical fatigue turns afterwords into an existential weariness and seeing the sleep-deprived detective Dormer is worth the price of entrance. Locations are also fantastic, showing the wonderful Alaska's landscapes. The idea that makes the whole flick so special is the drama within the drama, the unsolved murder within the unsolved moral conflict and finally the emotional ending that matches the strong intelligence of the film. Hilary Swank too gives a very strong performance.",Insomnia

Al and his homicide squad partner come up from LA (where their unit is under investigation) and assist Alaskan police on a murder case in mid-summer. Al never quite adjusts to the 24 hour sunlight but that's only one of his many issues. Swank does really well as the local smart, hard-working and appreciative help. Al gives a nice textured performance, everyone sort of has shades of this or that in this movie, as things progress we learn a little more about the characters and what led to the murder. At points Al's eccentric behavior may test credibility but the story moved along well, this is a serviceable cop drama.",Insomnia
108,Philby-3,No cure for Insomnia here,8,11 October 2002,"This film is definitely not to be seen if you are suffering from insomnia, as the director Christopher Nolan, and Al Pacino do a great job of depicting the complaint. This is truly an example of daylight film noir, as one of our local critics put it. One does wonder whether a thicker set of curtains might have helped, but Al plays a man at the end of his tether in a number of respects. His career is in doubt, he has no personal life to speak of and he faces a bleak retirement. Yet he is tenacious in solving the case. His young local assistant, hero-worshiping him from afar gets to know some of the cost of being a good detective.Robin Williams plays the supercilious killer (we learn early on it is indeed him and the suspense lies in whether a case can be put against him). This character is really a literary conceit - most crims are not terribly smart- and a difficult part to realise effectively, but Williams, who is good at oddballs, plays him in a low-key, effective way. I usually find 'why I did it' scenes artificial, but here they seem to work.Hillary Swank as the young cop is all bright eyes and bushy tail but she fills the role admirably as the eager beaver who wants to learn from the great detective. She teams well with Pacino, who's seen it all and can't forget what he's seen.The landscape, darkly brooding, is a character also. Most of the film was filmed in British Columbia rather than Alaska where the story is set (though we do see a couple of Alaskan glaciers). Anyway, almost all of the inhabited parts of Alaska are below the Arctic circle and don't have the midnight sun, whereas Tromso, the setting of the original Norwegian film this is a remake of, is indeed above 66 degrees north. Not to worry, it seems it's not just the light that's preventing Al from sleeping.Christopher Nolan directs here in a much more straightforward fashion than he did in 'Memento', but he's good at menace and setting the movie on the frontier gives it an edge, at least for those who see the frontier as a scary place. In fact you are probably safer in the wilds of Alaska than the streets of LA. Not to worry. This is a very satisfactory thriller from the dark side, despite the perpetual daylight.",Insomnia

111,film-critic,There are two kinds of people in Alaska...,7,25 November 2006,"In 2002 I went to the theaters and saw Insomnia on the big-screen. I was impressed by the eclectic range of characters from Hilary Swank, Al Pacino, and Robin Williams  a combination that I may have put money down prior to this film the group that would never share screen time together. I was wrong. I also was eagerly anticipating what Nolan would do with this film, having not seen the original when I went to the theater; I knew that he would bring us a compelling drama that would pull the best out of our cast. I was not disappointed. I loved the combination of acting between Pacino and Williams because they had two completely different styles. I thought Swank was decent, but contributed very little to the simpleton character she was to play  and I thought that Maura Tierney as the reclusive innkeeper was a great fit. I loved the way that Nolan filmed it, the cinematography was excellent, and the music kept me on the edge of my seat until the very, cliché ending. I was in awe of this film  that is  until I saw the original. Now, I find myself questioning the value of this film and of Nolan's honesty to the original director's vision. It nearly makes me tear up to see a great, valued independent foreign film get the slap of U.S.D.A. Hollywood on it with bigger budgets, bigger scripts, and an ending that seemed like it arrived directly from the ""How to build a great climax"" handbook handed to new  mainstream directors.For those looking for a review of just this version of Insomnia, I want to initially say that watching this film on its own is good. If you have not seen the original, then this is a great eye candy film with fantastic scenes that prove that Nolan can conquer his trade if given the opportunity (remember what he did with the Batman legacy), but together these films do not match up and fans of the original will scoff at Nolan's poor attempt to bring the honesty and directness that director Erik Skjoldbjærg superbly brought to the screen. I understand that one, when making comments about Insomnia, should keep them separate, but there are so many disheartening differences between the two that I do not want others to purely watch this one with Pacino and Williams, but instead see the two and make their own assessments. To begin, Pacino is no Stellan Skarsgård (as odd as that may be to say), but Skarsgård brings a character to the screen forcing us to follow the emotional level of the events, instead of Pacino's over-the-top reactions to situations. While Skarsgård brings intensity to the character due to events and his ""unknown"" past, Pacino brings a visual to the character. You cannot seem to take your eyes off Pacino, but that is just him being the actor that he is. There are elements left out of Nolan's interpretation that are key to truly giving us the ""bad cop"" mentality that we are supposed to have about Dormer. Oddly, in the original, we are not supposed to find ourselves liking or feeling sympathy for Skarsgård, but in this one we want to see Pacino come clean and rid himself of the guilt. A big difference between the two films is the cross-referencing between Pacino and Skarsgård, because by seeing each of these two bring something new to the table, we, as viewers, saw a completely different film.Nolan's discreet changes morphs this film into something completely different that originally conceived. To call this film a remake would be tough in my eyes, because it is not a remake. It is a new interpretation of a classic film. Nolan makes some small changes to the plot which ultimately changes that course of our characters and the overall tones of the film. For example, there is quite a bit more Hollywood ""running"" in Nolan's film than in the original. Skarsgård captures our attention because of his internal conflicts, while Nolan captures our attention in his film by forcing us to watch Pacino run Williams down, to see him screaming his lines at random characters, and the ending that just epitomizes the standard that Hollywood seems to embrace. Without giving away too much detail, I must say that unlike the original, more gunfire is used, the intensity of the music is increased, and an event occurs with our main character that changes the original film completely. That is why I cannot call this film a remake in any way shape or form. This is an interpretation, albeit a very close interpretation, but not identical. Nolan took chances, he changed the frame of the story, and gave us a pure 100% uncut slice of Hollywood that one could almost witness in any blockbuster released during the summer months. It was pathetic and if I were the director of the original, Nolan's interpretation would have made me rather upset.Overall, I still like Nolan's work, and while I have lowered my enjoyment of this film after seeing this original, I must say that from 2002-present I thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's Insomnia. So, where does that put us currently? I would suggest this film to friends mainly because I am a sucker for Pacino's work (early and recent), and for some strange reason I cannot say ""no"" to a Robin Williams' film (even if this took place during his ""dark"" stint). I also think that Nolan's craft is unmatched today, and while he will conform to Hollywood (i.e. Insomnia), he uses it to pay rent and finance his next films. I will say this to friends as well, if you want to see a great film, one must see the original Insomnia and witness a truly disturbing character at his best. Skarsgård is on the top of his game with version, and Pacino can not compete.Grade: *** ½ out of *****",Insomnia
112,kevin c,PACINO KEEPS QUIET SHOCK,4,12 October 2002,"A solid follow up to the excellent ""Memento"" from Nolan. An absorbing thriller, with a beautiful setting. You know where you're going, but there are enough sub-plots to pad out this tale.Good performances from the dependable Pacino, Swank and Donovan. Williams has been praised for a return to form. However I think he's beyond redemption, and was the weakest link in an otherwise good film..",Insomnia
113,saptesh786,Feel guilty deeply of partners' killing,4,19 August 2019,"Very dull movie. Starting is good but middle long portion only feels boring. Climax is in hurry and predictable. Attitudes of Al Pacino is shown in initial interrogation is not continued further. Moreover his partner is killed by him mistakenly is been a big issue in the story, whereas AP did not kill him intentionally. This big issue makes movie lack its grip of suspense or mystery of murder. In other word to feeling guilty for parterre's killing is dominating whole story otherwise it could be a good suspense thriller. Acting by Al Pacino is just okay. Hillary Swank has a spark. However movie is not recommended.",Insomnia
114,sarastro7,"Absorbing, off-beat thriller",7,27 December 2005,"Insomnia was better than I'd expected. It kept my attention throughout, and all the main actors were very strong, esp. Hilary Swank (her best performance yet, I'd say). I liked the way Pacino's character was always far ahead of the rest of the police, trying to set things up behind the scenes. It was an unusual story, very well told and with a lot of effective characterization.I would like to rate it higher than a 7 out of 10 (I'd rate it 7.5 if I could), but I feel it also had some shortcomings. For instance, how did the murderer know all about Pacino's character's trouble with Internal Affairs when the local police didn't even have a clue? Also, since this is a remake of a no doubt superior original, I can't rate it as highly as its previous incarnation. So a 7 it is. But good movie.",Insomnia
115,Richie-67-485852,You Won't Sleep,10,19 June 2017,"Impossible to sleep while watching this movie! Why? Its a thriller for one thing full of a good story with fine acting and directing. To make it even more interesting, it takes place in Alaska and has story within story dynamics something that if done right is most satisfying to viewers. This is done right. It takes a short while to get used to Robin in a serious role but it works so well. Pacino is worth the price of a ticket on his own too. He makes such a good cop because he is an experienced actor. Small town life here is worth noting with everyone knowing everyone else and complications don't exist. Life is predicable and repeats itself making you wonder if that is what everyone has in common who lives there? The entire little town seems to be fenced in with mountains but does have ferry boat, waterway and sea plane access as well as long stretches of highway all scenic as a plus. I bet the air there is as clean as you can get it. Good movie to snack on as the story unfolds or have a sandwich ready to go with a tasty drink. One thing that bears noting is the way Pacino has trouble literally keeping his eyes open as he is acting out not being able to sleep for days. If you watch his expressions, I warn you upfront, you may get a little drowsy but do finish the movie at all costs. Then nap if you can",Insomnia
116,mattymatt4ever,"Great, compelling piece of work!",9,5 June 2002,"I was really looking forward to this film, and I'm glad to say that I wasn't the least bit disappointed.  First of all, I was glad to see Al Pacino on screen again.  It seems like it's been a while since I've seen him on screen.  I think the last film he was in was ""Any Given Sunday.""  Pacino yet again delivers a brilliant performance, strapping the audience in for a wild ride through the emotionally scarred mind of Detective Will Dormer.  It seemed like I could feel his every emotion throughout the course of the movie.  Because this is a character-driven story that revolves around Dormer, his pain, anguish and guilt on account of accidentally taking his partner's life, constant insomnia and subsequent threats by his nemesis, played by Robin Williams as a writer of trashy detective novels who's fascinated by Dormer and blackmails him by threatening to spill out the secret of Dormer shooting his partner.  As for Robin Williams, he is fully convincing as the reclusive novelist/murderer of a 17-year-old girl.  I suspected, from the trailers, that he'd play a serial killer.  I wouldn't exactly classify his character as a serial killer, but he is the antagonist and a murderer and Williams plays the role perfectly, never underplaying it and never overplaying it.  He could've went over-the-top, playing a totally ruthless killer who cackles at the thought of murdering someone in cold blood.  Though he's not our sympathetic character, you do feel sympathy for him at times.  And I like how the story creates this little cat-and-mouse game between the two characters, each one plagued by skeletons in the closet.  Oscar-winner Hilary Swank delivers another fine performance, and I was stunned to see how amazingly attractive she looks, after having seen her gender-bending role as Brandon Teena in ""Boys Don't Cry.""
Christopher Nolan is the acclaimed director of ""Memento"" and he scores yet again, with this beautifully constructed thriller.  I was intrigued from start to finish.  Nolan's use of lighting is dark and murky, wonderfully setting the noirish tone.  Nolan shows great promise as an up-and-coming director, and with a good outlet he can possibly become the next Kubrick. I greatly look forward to seeing his next project, whenever that may be.I recommend ""Insomnia"" to anyone who loved Nolan's previous ""Memento"" or anyone who simply enjoys a great, multi-faceted mystery/thriller that will keep you guessing at every turn.  I think it's too early to vote this movie as one of the best films of 2002, but it's a possible candidate.  We don't see too many ""great"" films anymore, and whenever they're out there it's good to take advantage.My score:  9 (out of 10)",Insomnia
117,hall895,Nowhere near Nolan's best but still quite good,7,23 October 2014,"Insomnia is probably the least of Christopher Nolan's films. That's not all that surprising when you consider it's not an original Nolan work but a remake of an earlier Norwegian film. What also should not be surprising is that even a lesser Christopher Nolan film is still a really good film. The guy doesn't make bad movies. Insomnia may lack the uniqueness of his original works. But this movie still has a compelling story to tell. And Nolan is more than up to the challenge of delivering that story in a fashion which is both entertaining and thought-provoking.The story centers around Los Angeles police detective Will Dormer who along with his partner has traveled to a small Alaskan town to assist with a murder investigation. Dormer is a notably famous cop, a hero, but left behind in Los Angeles is an internal affairs investigation which threatens to undo his life's work. As he lands in Alaska this weighs heavily on his mind. And things are about to get a whole lot worse. In the course of hunting down the Alaskan killer Dormer makes a huge, catastrophic mistake. If discovered this error really will bring Dormer's life crashing down. Crucially none of the Alaskan police he works with know what he has done. Unfortunately for Dormer one person does know: the killer. And now the killer sees himself as Dormer's partner. They're going to help one another get away with their respective misdeeds. Wracked by guilt, in a terrible moral quandary, what will Dormer do? He really is in a terrible state, made much worse by the fact he can't sleep at all. What's really keeping him awake? Is it the perpetual Alaskan sunlight? Or is it his own guilty conscience?The role of Dormer is pretty much perfect for Al Pacino who brings both a sense of authority and a great weariness to the role. Dormer, successful though he may be, is really being beaten down by life and up in Alaska things are only getting worse. The guy is crumbling and Pacino captures that very well. The other key performance comes from Robin Williams who shows up halfway through the film inhabiting a character who is quite unlike anything you'd expect from this particular actor. The film provides a chance for Williams to show off some serious acting chops and he delivers. Pacino and Williams play off one another brilliantly, the tension between their two characters is palpable and it drives the film forward. Hilary Swank has an important role as well, playing a young Alaskan police officer who idolizes Dormer but who does a little digging and realizes there may be some very bad things the famous detective has hidden away. To what lengths will Dormer go to protect those dangerous secrets? That is the crux of this film's plot. It's not your typical good guy/bad guy story. The lines between good and bad are not just blurred, they're completely wiped away. It's a smart story which really grabs you. And the film is photographed beautifully. The light might be forever shining but there is true darkness lurking here. Story, performances, photography...everything comes together very well. Even in a film which is not nearly his best effort Christopher Nolan produces something quite excellent.",Insomnia
118,jhclues,Outstanding Performance by Pacino,9,28 May 2002,"The breathtaking beauty of a remote area of Alaska provides the setting for this film, and the natural splendor of the surroundings offers a thought provoking contrast between the serenity of the landscape and the ugliness visited upon it by one of it's inhabitants.  In the thriller `Insomnia,' director Christopher Nolan examines the myriad faces of evil and the far-reaching effects of wrongdoing, whether perpetrated straightforwardly as a heinous crime, or in the ill conceived notion of subverting the law in a quest for justice.  But he also looks beyond the objectivity of premeditation at how certain physical variables can subjectively affect the psychological aspects of the duplicity.  Specifically, what happens to the body-- and especially to the mind-- when deprived of sleep for an extended period of time.  And especially when it comes at a critical juncture; at a time when, above all else, the mind must be absolutely clear and sharp, when judgments must be passed and decisions made.  Can a web of deceit, woven amid a struggle between the mind and the body, stand fast?  And if so, for how long?  How long can one prevail against the proclivities of human nature, in a place where the sun never sets, and the mind cannot find rest.	L.A. detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino), and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), have been given a special assignment:  The investigation of the murder of a seventeen-year-old girl in the small town of Nightmute, Alaska.  Their detail comes on the heels of a certain internal affairs investigation currently being conducted within the L.A.P.D., which may involve the high-profile Dormer, a good cop who has been putting away the bad guys for more years than he can remember.  And if the I.A. affair goes south, some criminals Dormer has been instrumental in convicting may see freedom.  So the change of venue for the detectives comes at an auspicious time; sometimes distance can be a good thing.	Dormer goes into the case with the confidence provided him by years on the job.  He is lucid, and on top of things immediately.  What he finds in Nightmute, however, is a killer who is not only meticulous, but who has a wild card up his sleeve and begins to play it not long after Dormer hits town.  It's the time of year when the sun never sets, and the killer realizes that it is going to affect Dormer's sleep, and subsequently, his perceptions and actions.  And he's determined to help the situation along with some untimely phone calls and some well chosen words.  Dormer's onto the game immediately, but after a couple of days of sleeplessness, his mental faculties begin to deteriorate, and it leads to a situation involving Eckhart that puts an entirely new spin on the matters at hand.  Things get sticky, and Dormer's judgment becomes questionable.  He struggles to keep himself together, because he knows one thing for certain:  The killer has crossed a line from which there is no return, and he's going to kill again. And it's up to Dormer to stop him before it happens.	As with his previous effort, `Memento,' Christopher Nolan has crafted and delivered a film that is emotionally stirring and initially, at least, devoid of any absolutes (or if there are any, they are soon lost in Dormer's sleeplessness induced mental haze), to which he adds a moral dilemma that makes it all entirely involving and which successfully draws the audience into the action as the story unfolds.  it becomes an incisive character study that affords you Dormer's perspective while allowing you to experience his situation seemingly first hand.  Nolan gradually takes you from the rational thought processes that to Dormer are the norm, to the murky regions of the ambiguous into which he descends as the sleeplessness overcomes and overwhelms him.  And the fact that Dormer's impaired mental state is so significant-- inasmuch as the direction it takes the story-- makes this a rather unique film; it's an interesting angle, and quite different from the usual considerations offered by the typical crime/thriller/drama.  Most importantly, Nolan knows how to present it effectively, and builds the tension in direct proportion to Dormer's descent, which maintains that necessary edge right up to the climax.	By the end of the film, Pacino/Dormer really looks as though he hasn't slept in days; it's a critical aspect of the story, upon which the credibility of the film depends, and which it achieves, without question. Some credit has to go to the make-up provided by Gitte Axen, but ultimately, what makes this film so convincing-- and such an unqualified success-- is Al Pacino's performance.  As he demonstrates here, he is arguably one of the top two leading actors in the business (the other being De Niro).  He has the ability to create a completely new character with every new film, and he's always convincing, whether taking it over-the-top (Tony Montana, `Scarface'; Vincent Hanna, `Heat'), using a more introspective approach (Michael Corleone, `The Godfather') or finding the necessary reserve that fits a particular character and makes him believable (as he does here with Will Dormer).  This is a studied portrayal, presented in subtle shadings and tone, and one that should easily earn him an Oscar nomination.	Turning in a solid performance, also, is Robin Williams, who seems to be taking a page out of Pacino's book by finding the kind of restraint he needed to make his character work.  Williams has played a variety of roles in his career, but never has he played so against type as his portrayal of Walter Finch in this film; and he does it well.  He's entirely convincing-- his Finch is very real and disquietingly believable, in that his outward appearance is so normal, while in reality he is capable of deeds most vile. His true nature is undetectable, and as such, he's your worst nightmare.  It makes Dormer's conundrum even more pronounced, and helps to make `Insomnia' a riveting and thoroughly engrossing film.  9/10.",Insomnia
119,educallejero,"Finally watched it from my favorite director. Good is the floor, apparently!",6,23 March 2019,"This was more of a (really) slow burn.
The story is nothing really special, about ""good cops vs. the right way vs. the judicial system vs. the bad cops vs. the bad guys"". Done before and after. It's fine. It's good.Problem is, the clichés that built the story the first 40 minutes are a bit boring to watch.After that, the tension goes up and never goes down. Pacino was really good, in kind of an easy role for him, but contrary to many, I dislike very much Robin Williams in general and he again just doesn't work here. (Awakenings may be the only time I thought it was good on a role).Here, Robin Williams destroys everything with his acting, tone, presence and face. Except for one scene, he fails Pacino and the movie. Put Patrick Wilson (or many others) on the role? This is suddenly much, much better. Swank wasn't that good either. Allison Tolman from Fargo Season 1 would've nailed the part! (with time traveling, I know).In the end, the worst Nolan movie, it is still good.",Insomnia

The creepy atmosphere of this remote Alaskan town in the far north country where the sun never sets is captured very well and creates an unsettled and unnerving undercurrent. Pacino's and William's work is very good here. The story, in addition to being a superb crime drama, is an excellently crafted tale of moral ambiguity, as the policeman's fate becomes slowly and inexorably conflated with that of the perpetrator. A movie for grownups, I think.",Insomnia
121,CharltonBoy,Mesmerising performance from Pacino,8,5 March 2003,I used to think that nobody could come close to Robert De Niro when it comes to who was the best actor in Hollywood but as the years went by he started to pick some real Turkeys and a in the mean while an old hand was gradually taking the crown from De Niro and that is Al Pacino. In Insomnia he has picked another cracker of a film that although not fast paced is brilliantly acted and is very watchable. Hilary Swank is superb as is Robin Williams and its refreshing to see him taking a serious role instead of sentimental trash like Patch Adams but as per usual it is Al Pacino who steals the show. He plays an insomniac Cop who gets intangled in a murder case and gets into trouble after accidently killing his partner . I cant think of an actor who looks more tired than Pacino anyway so he was perfect for the role. The story is OK but to be honest the film is more about the performances than the plot. 8 out of 10,Insomnia
122,gbheron,"Excellent Performances, Especially Williams",8,19 September 2002,"One doesn't expect to feel claustrophobic in Alaska, but that's exactly the effect when watching ""Insomnia"". The primary story is about the police investigation of the murder of a high-school girl in a small Alaskan town. Through the pull of old acquaintances and political necessity, two LA homicide detectives (Pacino and Martin Donovan) are dispatched to the scene to help the locals. The political necessity concerns a graft investigation in which the two LA detectives are key suspects. One is thinking of copping a plea, so they are spirited out of LA to avoid the investigative light. Then they find themselves in the 24-hour day of the Alaskan summer where the two plot lines collide; the murder investigation and the graft. And what a collision it is. The insomnia of the title is suffered by the Pacino character, who can't sleep during the movie's 7-day span. And each day his eyes are more sunken, he's groggier, less focused. This parallels his descent into guilt, remorse, and desperation. But to provide any more details would be to give away key plot elements. ""Insomnia"" is gripping and it's best to see the movie cold.The acting, especially Robin Williams as the key suspect in the child slaying, is top notch. Williams is made for these roles, he should kiss the suck-up feel-good stuff goodbye for good. The photography is excellent, Alaska never looked so ominous, and the direction delivers the goods. Highly recommended.",Insomnia
123,KnightsofNi11,Great but not at the same caliber as most Nolan films,8,30 August 2010,"Here's another great work by the masterful auteur that is Christopher Nolan. Insomnia is about two cops who go to a small town in Alaska to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. While chasing a suspect officer Will Dormer (Al Pacino) accidentally shoots and kills his partner Hap (Martin Donavan). Distraught at what this could do to his already dwindling reputation, which is explained in some very important back story, Dormer lies about the accident and tells everybody that it was the man they were chasing that shot Hap. This event leads to a dark series of twists and turns that go deep into the psychological nature of an emotionally provoked cop and a psychopathic killer.Insomnia is a very dark film, yet only in figurative terms. The film is never physically dark and this is for an extremely important reason that is also where the title of the film stems from. It takes place in an Alaskan town far up north and in many places like that it never gets dark for certain periods of the year. Dormer, a cop from Los Angeles, is investigating this murder during one of those periods. Because of the complete lack of darkness Dormer develops sleep problems and is hit hard by insomnia. It is this that spurs on a thrilling chain of events that lead up to an incredible climax that comes very unexpectedly. This setting creates for a compelling juxtaposition of psychological themes that branch out towards the sleep depraved nether regions of the human mind, to the dark and twisted mind of an unconventional killer, who Robin Williams portrays with absolute disturbing perfection. Robin Williams, despite being as hilarious as he is, always amazes in his more serious roles and Insomnia is a fantastic exposè of his dramatic talent.Dark and brooding films are not something that are far and few between in this day and age of cynicism, yet Insomnia is able to stand out as one of the better portrayals of the dark side of the human mind. And not only is Insomnia a good example of a dark thriller, it is just an all around well made film. Pacino and Williams are incredible together and their counteracting roles balance each other out in such an immaculate and harrowing way. They are both given a fantastic script to work off of that weaves a captivating story that will leave you thinking, while also entertained. And of course it is a Christopher Nolan film so the stylistic direction is of course great. The jumpy and claustrophobic way in which it is shot provides a fuller experience of the psychological thriller story. Nolan keeps the technical grandeur toned down greatly for this picture, but his visual stamp is still there.My only real complaint with this film is that it is not as big as what you would expect from a Nolan film. It is much smaller in scale and doesn't blow your mind out of proportion like his other films do. However, this is hardly a legitimate complaint because an individual movies quality should not be compared alongside another. Each film is its own and should be critiqued as such. Thus saying that Insomnia lacks the pizzaz of other Nolan films is not so much a criticism so much as a personal observation.Insomnia is a great addition to the psychological thriller genre. Its a great story that keeps you wanting more and Pacino and Williams absolutely amaze. Don't expect anything huge but definitely check this one out for visual and psychological aesthetic.",Insomnia
124,carbuff,"A solid 10, at least until I see the original foreign production.",10,10 May 2015,"I think that it is a mistake to do like I did and watch this movie well into the early morning hours right before going to bed--it's just too psychologically disturbing, or at least it was for me. With regard to the performers, while it doesn't seem like that nice a thing to say coming so soon after Robin Williams truly tragic demise, his real forte was playing seriously creepy guys, as he does so convincingly here. Al Pacino, whose normal mode is painful and ridiculous overacting, restrains his natural inclinations well and turns in a great performance, one which really captures the claustrophobia of his character's situation. Hilary Swank is also at the top of her game, and Christopher Nolan as the director creates the perfect mood for this unsettling film. The only thing that might bring this down from a perfect 10 is if I get the chance to watch the original foreign movie on which this remake is based, since experience tells me that it will almost certainly better yet.",Insomnia
125,petra_ste,When a villain protagonist becomes an anti-hero,7,9 March 2014,"There is a scene in the original Insomnia where the protagonist (there played by Stellan Skarsgard, in this remake by Al Pacino), desperate to obtain a damaged bullet to tamper with the evidence of an ongoing investigation, approaches a dog in a dark alley and kills it. The remake mimics the scene, except the dog shot by Pacino is dead already. In a nutshell, this shows the difference between the two movies.Before this sounds like some kind of anti-remake crusade, I'll say Nolan's movie surpasses the Norwegian original from many points of view.Performances are stronger, led by a nicely low-key turn by Pacino, who reminds us what a great thespian he can be when he isn't hamming it up. The character of the killer is more developed, here aptly played by Robin Williams in one of those creepy clear-eyed, smug-faced turns of his. Dialogues are crisp without getting too cozy, cinematography makes an interesting use of colors and light.So, where does this thriller - focused on two veteran Homicide detectives searching for a killer in Alaska - goes wrong? It erases most of the moral ambiguity of the original. Skarsgard's dark protagonist was genuinely unsettling - a lost man who quickly sinks to ignominious lows to cover up his own mistakes. Here, Pacino is flawed in a much safer and more traditional way. The extent this remake goes to soften his main character into something more palatable to a mass audience is actually rather amusing in a meta kind of way.The greatest betrayal, though, is the ending, with the martyred hero redeemed by his own blood who passes the torch to Swank's young idealistic cop with a smile and a moral lesson. From the director of the dangerous and abrasive Memento, it's a real shame.7,5/10",Insomnia

I haven't seen the original movie this film is based on, but I certainly would like to, based upon the plot,which is an extremely brilliant and thoughtful one. I did enjoy this version of it, I wasn't nodding off in the theatre, but I do have to say it lacked that thrilling kinky edge of both Following and Memento; there is something to be said for non-linear storylines and Nolan is brilliant at them.

127,swilliky,An awesome detective thriller with great directing and acting,7,21 July 2017,"Christopher Nolan takes on a noir detective story with a unique location. Detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) arrives in Alaska, tired but ready to work. He and his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are greeted by local policewoman Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank). The Los Angeles detectives are investigating the murder of a young high school girl Kay Connell (Crystal Low) but Dormer is disoriented by the daylight in the middle of the night. They stay at a hotel run by Rachel Clement (Maura Tierney). Hap is being investigated by Internal Affairs and is thinking of confessing which would incriminate Will. The next morning on little sleep, Will and Hap head to the high school to interrogate Kay's boyfriend Randy Stetz (Jonathan Jackson) who is uncooperative during the questioning. He does admit that Kay was seeing someone else but he doesn't know who it is. Will treats Ellie as a protégé schooling her on the procedure and the little things of an investigation. When Kay's bookbag is found in a cabin, it provides clues and a trap for Will to devise. Dormer continues to threat over the IA investigation, doubting his own tactics. When the amateur Alaskan police botch the stakeout alerting the suspect, a foot chase ensues through the cabin and fog. A policeman is shot but Will Dormer pursues the suspect across slick rocks and fires into the mist possibly shooting and killing his partner Hap. Overcome with grief, Will is unable to sleep and keeps reflecting back on his previous shortcuts he took to nab awful criminals. He works to cover up the possibility that he shot his partner as he becomes increasingly dazed. Noises disturb him and he hallucinates his partner giving him accusatory looks. The killer calls him up on the phone and reveals that he knows of Will's guilt in killing his partner. Ellie suspects that something isn't quite right with Will's account of his partner's shooting. Will confront Tanya Francke (Katharine Isabelle) taking her to the dump where Kay's body was dumped after spooking her by playing chicken with a truck. Tanya mentions Kay's secret lover who promised the young victim all sorts of things. The killer calls him again at the station taunting him about what he knows and Will offers to meet him.

128,Maziun,Conscience never sleeps,7,23 August 2013,"This is important movie in Nolan's directing career . After the success of ""The Following"" and especially ""Memento"" (two low budget thrillers) he got a chance to direct a big budget movie . He had chosen to create a remake of Swedish thriller – ""Insomnia"". It's not really hard to understand why . The Swedish original deals with themes and elements that Nolan talks about in his movies – the obsession , useful lie , morally ambiguous main hero , thin line between good and evil , women catalyst the plot , hero losing his grip on reality and the feel of neo-noir movie.It's interesting that this is Nolan's only movie that wasn't written by him . Every other movie he made was either written by him or co-written . Here Hilary Seitz is the only writer , although Nolan did consult the screenplay with him. I haven't seen the Swedish original , but from what I've heard this movie isn't a shot by shot remake and few things were changed. For more on the changes you should see the IMDb FAQ .""Insomnia"" seems less impressive compared to Nolan's earlier and later thrillers . Maybe because it feels like a rather conventional story . While other Nolan's thrillers either explored unknown grounds (""The Prestige"" , ""Inception"") or were told in creative non-chronological way (""The Following"" , ""Memento"") here ""Insomnia"" feels very un-Nolan like. Maybe it's because Seitz is the writer . The dialogue don't have that certain rhythm or British humor . Many little plot twists that change the situation don't appear here . The story is rather linear (with the exception of flashbacks) . Some people even don't know that this movie was made by Nolan.It doesn't mean that ""Insomnia"" isn't worth watching . Hell no. Since this is a cat and mouse game between cop and killer , where all the cards are put on the table from the beginning , Nolan tries different things here . The movie is much slower than his other movies . This time is all about the mood. Wally Pfister captures the cold beauty of Alaska well . The thriller is also very atmospheric and manages to capture how main hero is losing his grip on reality thanks to insomnia. There are two great scenes here : the shootout and the chase scene.The movie relies heavily on the psychological tension between the hero and the villain . Without good actors ""Insomnia"" would fell apart . Here , Al Pacino gives one of his better performance , especially in recent years , as the tired of fighting injustice cop . This movie also shows Nolan's sixth sense when it comes to inspired casting – Robin Williams. Before ""Insomnia"" and ""One hour photo"" people would laugh at the idea that Williams would play a criminal . Here , he gives he's character some truly disturbing creepiness hiding under quite sympathetic face. His character comes out like a cynical weirdo who doesn't seems to notice that he's doing bad things. The chemistry between Pacino and Williams in on of the strongest things in the movie.Hilary Swank seems to not have as much screen time as she needs and her character isn't too expanded . Too bad , because she feels quite crucial to the story . Also , the ending is kinda a letdown in that way it's not impressive and feels uninspired.""Insomnia"" is a good thriller that asks important question : how far would you go to defeat evil ?

The first time I forgot to click the send button and the second time I exited out of the site without sending it first. So, here I go for the third time:Al Pacino gives one of the best performances of his career! I really feel that he deserves another Oscar for his performance here. Robin Williams was good, but I don't feel that he deserves an Oscar. The art direction was also wonderful. I love the way the sky never changes from that dreaded, bright white. Christopher Nolan has done a movie better than his previous MEMENTO. If he keeps getting better with time, then we're going to have some good movies on our hands.This movie is about two homicide detectives sent to Nightmute, Alaska to investigate the murder of a 17 year-old girl. But the killer soon begins playing mind games with one of the detectives who develops the inability to sleep. There are many great performances here, Al Pacino especially and he doesn't get an Oscar, then there is something seriously wrong with the Academy. I recommend this movie to anyone with a general interest in suspense movies, or if you just want to see some really good movies before the Oscar race heats up so you can tell who's good and who's bad.Other good movies like this are SE7EN, MURDER BY NUMBERS and FARGO, which is very similar.

131,RonellSowes,"Corruption,ethics and insomnia",6,19 November 2020,"This is one of the few films directed by Christopher Nolan not included in the IMDB Top 250 but one of his better works.
The premise for the entire story is questionable as detectives being brought in from other states for no reason other than they're record doesn't sound like common practice. Something else that isn't common practice is setting movies in Alaska,where daylight can last up to 24 hours. Setting the film there certainly adds a unique twist to it and fits well with the overall texture of the film. One similarity between all of Christopher Nolan's films is that they have a certain feel to them and they're all very Nolany. Which is great if you are completely infatuated with his style but if not,then prepare for some seat shifting moments.Al Pacino has a natural haggard appearance and being cast as an insomniac practically seems like typecasting. But of course Pacino's the sort of actor who can make any role look as if it was made for him.
Watching Robin Williams,most known for his comedic performances, as a child murderer is quite different. However, he pulls the role off suprisingly well.Set in the cold,barren Alaskan frontier the film is about a murder case surrounded by corruption,honor and insomnia.",Insomnia

The acting is pretty good by everyone, but no one really shines in this one. That often hurts a film with a big name in it (in this case, Pacino), but not in this case. Rather, it's a collaborative effort and the film benefits from the combination of talents. The story is engrossing enough to hold the viewer and the sheer beauty of Alaska definitely helps in keeping the viewer's interest, too. Definitely worth a rental.",Insomnia

The procedural wasn't tense and the twists therefore just happened along the way.To me there is a nonchalant way of telling this story, embodied by the ever nonchalant Pacino. The Internal Affairs back-story may have looked brilliant at the time, but it totally dilutes the case and actual setting. Choosing permanent daylight season may have looked brilliant too but it loses the edginess of a tired cop too used to open his eyes in the dark.In the end nothing really caught my eye - I would even say I found the overall editing of the story choppy - and most of all the Insomnia gimmick didn't work and fast became annoying.",Insomnia

Both of the detectives are a bit on the edge, as they both know back in home there's a internal investigation waiting for both of them. On the top of that Dormer (Al Pacino () is trying his best to fight against insomnia, caused by the never descending summer sun of the northern hemisphere. Or maybe it is guilt that keeps knocking in the back of his mind, that keeps him awake.The things escalate, when Dormer accidentally shoots his partner Eckhart (Martin Donovan) and tries to pin the blame on the killer they are chasing. Only one who sees holes in his story is the young detective Burr (Hillary Swank), who struggles between exposing the truth and admiration towards her older colleague.The guilt. That is the main word here. We all are guilty of something, but of what. And what are we willing to do to cover that guilt and how severe are the thing we are guilty of. Also, there's a moral in the story, which goes, that only way to get rid of they guilt is to do the right thing, even if might cause a storm after wards.Christopher Nolan does a steady job helming this film. The feeling is paranoid and atmosphere is grim and menacing. But it also is quite clear from the get go, that the things are gonna explode and the sins are gonna get revealed at the end. Robin Williams does a good, yet predictable role as the killer, who has had his killer instinct woken up and the final outcome of the film can be seen coming from a far distance. But in the end, a solid cast and a good direction do bring the film from mediocre to good, so I'd recommend it for the fans of good noir yarns.",Insomnia
136,Christian_Dimartino,Doesn't feel like a Nolan movie. It's not as good as a majority of them. But it's still a great film.,9,22 July 2010,"Al Pacino is a cop who isn't what you think in a film that you don't see coming, Christopher Nolan's Insomnia. Christopher Nolan, the greatest film maker alive, has done better films. It's a Nolan film that isn't like a Nolan film. But yet I was amazed by it. As he always seems to do with every one of his films. This one isn't a mind bender. It's a mind messer.Pacino plays Detective Will Dormer, a detective with a secret past. When he travels down to Alaska to investigate a teen's murder, he accidentally kills his partner. And frames the killer of the teen so then when they catch him he will be put on death row.When he meets Finch(played terrificly by Robin Williams, who had a villianish year that year), he finds out that he shares something in common with him. And the two of them kind of become partners in crime.The story plot isn't what you'd expect is it? I expected Pacino to go down there and try and solve some murder. It starts off that way, but goes down a road that you never saw coming. That is one thing that I love about it. Another thing is that the acting is terrific. I mean, Nolan directs three Oscar winners: Pacino, Williams, and Hillary Swank who plays a cop hoping to crack a big case.Insomnia is a very intriguing thriller. Nolan is my favorite director. But this movie doesn't seem like a Nolan movie. It's not as good as The Dark knight, Inception, The Prestige, or Memento. I left out Batman begins because though that was an amazing film, I still thought Insomnia was a little better.Christopher Nolan has done three out of five of my favorite films. My top five: The Dark knight, Magnolia, Inception, The Prestige, Boogie nights. Insomnia isn't as good as those films, or Memento, but it's a great movie. Nolan hasn't done anything even remotely bad. And at this day and age, i'm beginning to wonder if he ever will.Insomnia:A+",Insomnia
137,skepticskeptical,a killer's Socratic apology...and more...,8,3 January 2010,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the fact that there was a simple, two-word solution to Detective Dormer's sleep-deprivation problem: eye mask. Honestly, can anyone believe that the people who live in places with the problem of everlasting day have not caught on to this amazing technological development? In fact, decent hotels in such places would have their own built-in, two-word solution as well: window treatments.But, of course, the glaring daylight was an extended metaphor for the detective's sorry plight, having little by little sacrificed his principles and ended in the horrible predicament of feeling the need to lie about his accidental shooting of his partner.I loved the Alaskan (or Canadian?) landscape of this film. I also loved the fact that all of the locals looked as though they were a part of the Palin clan (one can only wonder whether a bit of inbreeding does not take place way up yonder...). But the best part of all, beyond Robin Williams' successful portrayal--way out of character--of a psychokiller, was the Socratic apology with which he relentlessly serenaded the poor sleep-deprived Dormer (played by Al Pacino): He didn't really mean to kill his victim, anymore than Dormer meant to kill his partner! We have here, stripped of extraneous matter, a bit of Socratic wisdom: No one knowingly does evil. And it's hard to deny, since one way of understanding an action is as an expression of one's belief in the moment that this is a good or at any rate permissible thing to do, all things considered. Other actions, then, those that are not intended, are committed by the agent when he is literally ""out of his head"". This is a deep philosophical puzzle which can be fruitfully pondered over for many hours. It also explains extremely well how atrocities have been committed by ""ordinary"" people throughout the history of human society.In the short documentary included on the DVD, Robin Williams went out of his way to dissociate himself from this way of exonerating a vicious killer. One senses that Williams feared that he may have been too convincing...Overall, I found INSOMNIA very worthwhile. This was a thought-provoking, philosophical film with beautiful cinematography and some decent acting. Swank managed to pull-off the guileless hick that she was supposed to be, in part thanks to her somewhat buck-toothed smile. Pacino was convincing, but Williams was the star of the show.",Insomnia
138,FlickJunkie-2,Taut detective thriller,8,9 November 2002,"Director Christopher Nolan made a sensational splash with the indie hit ""Memento"", earning him this shot at the big time. For the most part, he proved himself up to the task. ""Insomnia"" provides a multilayered psychological thriller where two distinct storylines are interwoven in the character of Will Dormer (Al Pacino). The workup is a bit contrived, with Dormer coming to Alaska from LA to help out an old buddy with a murder investigation as he is himself being investigated by internal affairs. This serves as a foundation for the two storylines. The first is the animosity that develops between Dormer and his partner, who wants to cut a deal with internal affairs. The second, of course, is the murder investigation. After Dormer accidentally (?) shoots his partner while chasing the suspect in dense fog, the psychological games begin. Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is fawning all over Dormer and has read all his books on detective work, begins to suspect that her hero may have feet of clay.The psychodrama becomes intense as Dormer is confronted with communications from his killer nemesis Walter Finch (Robin Williams), while suspicions swirl around the death of his partner. Add to this his inability to get any sleep in Alaska's perpetual daylight and you have a man driven to the absolute brink.Nolan does an excellent job of shooting this film and the editing intensifies the psychological tension. The cinematography is also superb, aided by the majestic Alaskan and British Columbian locations. While the interaction between Dormer and Finch is unlikely, the symbiotic relationship that develops is fascinating and Nolan squeezes every psychological tingle that can be wrung from it.Pacino is masterful as the insomniac cop who has made certain ethical compromises in his career in the name of justice. He looks so terrible that he must have been purposely depriving himself of sleep to increase the realism of the character. Pacino gives Dormer (an interesting play on the latin dormire, ""to sleep"", a dormer is the window of a sleeping room) a hard edge that gradually erodes as he becomes more sleep deprived, blurring the distinction between good and evil.Robin Williams seems to be trying to shed his nice guy image with back to back wackos. He follows up his sociopathic performance in ""One Hour Photo"" with this character who is a sort of sinister pragmatist. Williams is at his best when he is pushing sanity's limits, whether that be in zany comedy or maniacal mayhem, which is precisely why he was wrong for this part. This character is far too calculating and controlled for Williams talents and the part is also much too physical for him. He is just not convincing as a cold blooded killer and tough guy. That is not to say it was a bad performance, just the wrong actor. Hilary Swank unfortunately doesn't have much to do in a film that is dominated by Pacino and Williams.This is an excellent big budget debut for Nolan and another terrific performance by Pacino. The suspense and pace are first rate and despite the contrivances, it delivers. I rated it an 8/10. Definitely not a snoozer.",Insomnia

The movie stars Al Pacino as William Dormer a Los Angeles a detective on the force for 30 years (and couldn't sleep) whose partner is a young detective named Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) who are sent up to Alaska to help a local police department in a small town called Nightmute in order to solve the case of the murder of a teenage girl. As soon as Dormer and his partner arrive they meet a young police detective who happens to be a big fan of Detective Dormer's work named Ellie Burns (Hilary Swank). Dormer also happens to be a good friend of the police chief there whose last name is Nyback (Paul Dooley). As soon as they get there things start kicking up to speed, the policemen/women find the supposed killer in the fog but weren't able to get him and as a result Dormer's partner dies under strange circumstances. During that case Dormer meets a crime novelist named Walter Finch (Robin Williams) who claims that he killed the girl and that Dormer killed his partner. Pacino, Williams, and Swank really deserved Oscar nominations for their excellent work in this movie, and it is also worth noting that Pacino played an LA cop in 1995's ""Heat"" that was another great performance but he had to deal with another acting titan in Robert De Niro.The movie isn't the best movie that Christopher Nolan directed but it is movies like this that are the reason why I consider him to be the modern version of Alfred Hitchcock, Nolan would eventually direct great films like ""Batman Begins"" (2005), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""Inception"" (2010), ""The Dark Knight Rises"" (2012), and ""Interstellar"" (2014) all of those films were masterpieces and this one is right up there with them.

142,WriterDave,Best film of 2002 (thus far),9,26 September 2002,"""Insomnia"" exceeded all my wildest expectations. It displays visual techniques and common themes similar to ""Memento"" that show director Nolan is a stone cold auteur with lofty ambitions and talent to spare. Some say he sold out to Hollywood with this, but how can one complain when he brings out the best performance from Pacino in years. Pacino is normally playing himself and all his ticks, but here he actually inhabits a fully fleshed out and complex character and brings him to life. Nolan also brings out an effectively creepy performance from Robin Williams, who is more entertaining here than in ""One Hour Photo"", but perhaps not as studied. If Nolan keeps ""selling out"" like this, then hooray for Hollywood...we have our next Hitchcock. This is cat and mouse and psychological rambling at its best and most satisfying. Swank and Maura Tierney (an underused actress of much talent) are also fabulous in their non-showy roles. I can't recommend this film more highly. As of late September 2002, it's the best film of the year.",Insomnia

What I mean to say is that it looked good, but it didn't really strike me as anything great from the previews.  Also, I must say that I was less than stoked about Christopher Nolan directing (I wasn't a fan of ""Memento"", it was ok, but nothing great).  Well, needless to say, I ended up going to see this movie anyway.  I must concede that I liked the movie a great deal more than I thought I would.  Even about half way through the film I wasn't sure if I was really liking where the film was going, but by the end I was happy with the film.Again, I have to be brutally honest, I'm not a huge fan of Al Pacino. I've liked a bunch of his movies, but I don't think he's anything terribly great. But, I thought he did a great job in this film.  I've always been a huge fan of Robin Williams, this was quite a different role for him, but he pulled it off.  It was a little odd to see him as the antagonist, but he did a great job.  Hillary Swank (another person that I think is a pretty good actor/actress, but nothing great) did a great job too, and looked really good.  The rest of the cast did a fine job too, Maura Tierney, Nicky Katt, Jonathan Jackson, etc...The story was quite interesting, and did a great job of keeping you interested.  I thought the story did a great job of keeping you guessing whether or not Robin Williams' character was telling the truth of lying. I can't really say any more than that, or else I'll give away the good parts of the film.I thought this was a really good film, and definitely worth watching.

144,garethcrook,Sleep inducing.,5,28 July 2020,"Filling my final Nolan hole. This is another early one, I guess his first outing with some big names. We have homicide detective Al Pacino flying into rural Alaska, greeted by enthusiastic local cop Ellie (Hilary Swank). He's like a cross between a well groomed Columbo and Sherlock Holmes. Al plays Will, his sidekick is Hap (Martin Donovan). There's a little tension between them over police politics and career interests, it's a bit flat, but takes a dramatic twist in the midst of a fog filled gun chase with the suspect of the murder they've come to solve. One that sees Hap thankfully put out of his misery and Will press the button on his own demise. Alaska is a beautiful place and it looks great on screen not too surprising when the DOP is Wally Pfister. It feels a little wasted though. Especially when the place is bathed in near perpetual daylight. Pacino does his scene chewing thing, playing the renegade tortured cop, hiding his secrets, whilst trying to do his job on zero sleep (the perpetual daylight thing). It's all a bit mundane though and I'm itching for it to take on more interesting quirk. Maybe it's the location, but I'd love a bit of Twin Peaks or Northern Exposure weirdness. That's not where this is going though. It's a standard crime thriller. Even Robin Williams as the suspect bad guy Walter doesn't help much and I love Williams when he plays a serious role. Walter's a writer, a crime writer. A guilty crime writer and essentially that's what this boils down to. A guilty crime geek and a guilty cop dancing around one another as they try to help one another, but never at the expense of themselves. Psychologically it has its interesting moments, but aside Will's enforced Insomnia, there's not much to lift this. Even with Pacino, Williams and Swank, I'm thankful when this comes to a close. It nearly sent me to sleep.",Insomnia
145,dilipbts,Insomnia,8,18 August 2021,"First off, Christopher Nolan is one of my biggest influences when it comes to film and screen writing. With films such as Following and Memento, both of which reached cult following levels, he is well on his way to a successful Hollywood career. Then, today came, his 3rd film was released, Insomnia. Based on a 1997 Norwegian film written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, Insomnia is a true work of art in the world of film.Christopher Nolan takes all that was the 1997 film, and brings it to the next level, using his own style of directing, a musical score with shades of Memento, and an all star cast. Al Pacino and Robin Williams pulls out the greatest performances of their careers in the past decade, if not in their ENTIRE careers in my eyes.Pacino once again excels in the role of master dective, while Williams takes this chance to show his ""dark side"", and he does it so well. I can only hope that this is a rebirth of Robin Williams, and as it stands with his upcoming film One Hour Photo (which he once again plays a dark, psychotic role), it seems to be just that! Hilary Swank also pulls out what is the greatest role of her career.Insomnia brings you in as an audience, with it's perfectly woven plot, with a film noir feel to it, just as Nolan's first two films. It is a rollercoster ride of drama and suspense as you watch Al Pacino from the very beginning unravel, and the rest of the story and his past catches up with him. I can not say much more about it, as I do not wish to spoil anything about if for you, but I do want to say this... ...go see it, right now, and enjoy. If you love crime/mystery/drama films with that wonderful Film Noir feel to it, you will love this film. If that isn't your thing, then the performances of the three main actors are worth the price of a ticket in itself.Finally I just want to say, that Insomnia proves once and for all that Christopher Nolan will indeed be a force to reckoned with in Hollywood.

149,estreet-eva,Intriguing Daylight Noir,7,14 September 2015,"Firm noir stands as one of the most challenging genres. By their nature the shades of grey characters require a deft touch to produce a relative hero and relative villain among the flawed characters. Contrast that with the slasher genre where one just hires a group of attractive but wholesome looking teenagers and one unattractive white guy, colors a few buckets of corn syrup red and you are good to go (by the way, this is also the recipe for a Tarrantino movie just add way too much droning dialog). Insomnia is good film noir. Nolan uses the breathtaking Alaskan scenery (although like the ""The Proposal"" somehow the movie was shot on one of the handful of beautiful, warm, summer days in Alaska rather than the other 340 frigid ones) to set a backdrop of overexposure and to sell the central premise that Pacino's LA detective can't adjust to the failure of the sun to traverse the sky. How Nolan got Hollywood's two biggest (outside of Nicholson and anyone in a Tarantino picture) scenery-chewing actors - Pacino and Williams to turn in subtle, nuanced performances is a mystery worth an Oscar in itself. Pacino's age occasionally comes off as problematic in the film as several pivotal scenes require a level of athleticism that he clearly no longer possesses (the famously fit Williams never seems over-matched by the demands). Hilary Swank has the opposite issue, she seems just a little too experienced to play the fawning, impressionable wannabe detective who uncovers Pacino's dirty, big, secret. Like any Nolan film, little annoyances pepper the outing such as the abortive relationship between Pacino and the hotel clerk - they seems close despite not spending any time together. In short, however, the smart, atmospheric mystery is worth the viewing.",Insomnia
150,bsinc,"If there's a good European movie made, an American version will follow shortly",6,8 February 2006,"I think most movie remakes are totally unnecessary because 1) they either show nobody came up with a good story and therefore just took the easy way out by recycling an old one, 2) some director thought he could surpass the original and almost surely failed to do so, or 3)the movie's foreign and American's don't like that If you think number 3) isn't true, just think about it for a second. If there's a demand for something, then somebody usually wants That something. Was there ever a time I read an article on our beloved IMDb with a title like: ""US cinema's can't wait for the next Almodovar picture to be screened"". Now movie remakes derive from the US, by not even checking somewhere if this is true I know it is, without a doubt, a fact. There are nations (I know of bigger European ones, like Germany, France, Spain, Italy), that for generations have been borough up by watching every single possible thing on TV dubbed into their language. Be it ""The Simpsons"" or ""Casablanca"", they put huge amounts of money into the industry of dubbing and the end result is these nations have poor knowledge of other languages. Except for Germans, who luckily share a language similar to the English language, this is a fact. American't take a different approach, they brand the stuff their way, ALL the way. Big bucks are put into making a movie that's already been done. All this because in the end, they were borough up by watching only American stuff, and because Hollywood likes to earn something as well.It's actually funny and disturbing at the same time thinking just how racist this discussion could become, if pursued on. But this is not my point at all, amidst the almost accusative comments I've made thus far I've almost lost hold of it. In short, if there's a good European movie made, an American version will follow. This is sad enough as it is. What's even sadder is that this is happening faster and faster. It's almost a crime, the makers of the original get some Hollywood money for the rights to the movie, and the price they pay is much greater. Instead of them taking credit for a well done movie, the Hollywood machine does.Why Chris Nolan decided to make a remake is beyond me. After a story like ""Memento""!!! There is nothing bad that can be said about his version apart from it being a remake. Which is more than enough.

Donovan reveals to Pacino that he's been considering cooperating, a move that would ruin Pacino. While tracking down the murderer, a brutal accident puts Pacino in the hot seat. He tries to cover up his involvement, while suffering from insomnia due to the 24 hour daylight in this part of the world. Local rookie cop Hilary Swank, a great admirer of Pacino's, starts to realize something is wrong ... and the murderer (Robin Williams) himself contacts Pacino, revealing he knows what really happened and that he can help them both. This seems to be the least talked about of Nolan's films, which is a shame because it's a sharp and interesting remake of the 1997 Norwegian film that starred Stellan Skarsgard in Pacino's role.

When Robin Williams is billed next to Al Pacino, it's very difficult to decide if it's going to work out. However, the concept had me intrigued. The film starts off well, and the tension that Pacino creates with his partner is very tangible, this part of the film is where he really gets something to act with. However, I couldn't help but feel, as the film progressed, it was relying on his weary features to produce the look of an insomniac, rather than his true acting abilities. A few brief moments with the rookie Alaskan cop shows there's still something there, but I think it was the story that confined his acting rather than his acting confining the story.Robin Williams, however, puts in a wonderful performance. I couldn't see him in this role and I was convinced I'd be thinking about his comic runs. Not once, well maybe not true, but I only thought of them in retrospect. I was totally absorbed by his performance, and you almost are in a dilemma over his situation. He should get more serious roles out of this.The rest of the cast acts well, but I'm afraid that this may be another case of a Hollywood film ruining a good foreign film, although I have yet to see the original. The suspense is dampened throughout the second half, and I can't quite put my finger on why. Perhaps we are told too much and shown too much in the first half, and you know everything that is going on and why at every turn. Although it is billed that you will be torn as to what is wrong and right, this lasted for a mere instant, as the rights are so obviously more right than the wrongs. I think this is mainly due to the fact that the wrongs are all you are shown and what is played on, and too much of the character in the right is explained from a sympathetic point from the beginning.Right, enough of this essay. It's a pretty good film, and I know people who really enjoyed it, but unfortunately I feel it failed to project that blurring of wrong and right, and the suspense you would have expected.",Insomnia
153,supertom-3,One of the films of the year!,9,6 September 2002,"***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank all in the same film, it must be good, and it is. From Christopher Nolan, acclaimed British director of Memento, comes Insomnia.This is an exquisitely shot movie, directed with Oscar worthy assurance from Nolan and has three Oscar winners at the top of their game. This is one of the best films of the year, with of the blockbusting popcorn munchers like Star Wars and Spiderman, this is a great movie that requires thought and is a welcome change of pace, as was Minority Report  earlier in the year. For every couple of blockbusters that come out you need a good intelligent film like this as well.The story is this, in a small town in Alaska, a 17 year old girl has been murdered. Al Pacino's character Will Dormer and his partner are sent up to help the local law enforcement. The main reason for their temporary relocation is that Dormer and his partner are under investigation from Internal affairs. Dormers partner wants to cut a deal with them for the sake of his families but this would mean that Dormer would come under close scrutiny. Dormer doesn't want this as it could mean that if they dig up some dirt on him all his cases over the years will be questioned, and then murderers and rapists that he put away would be released. Dormer becomes angered by his partner, and it later becomes clear that their was dirt on him. Dormer had planted evidence on a child murderer to send him down, this was because there wasn't enough evidence to put him away, Dormer knew he did it and did what he thought was right, this raises the question `what would you do?' this is an involving thriller. Anyway, the investigations lead the law enforcement to a beach house where the killer emerges, and during a chase and shootout Dormer accidentally shoots down his partner and kills him. Dormer claims that the Williams character did it, and then covers his tracks by planting evidence and making sure he's in the clear. This leads Will to lose sleep, hence the title Insomnia, he his haunted by his dead partner and the guilt of breaking the law. Then Finch, played by Williams calls him. Finch knows that Dormer killed his partner and he claims that the murder of the girl was accidental. He tries to relate to Will, pointing out that they have a lot in common, in respect of suffering from Insomnia and the nature of their killings. The film is great in dealing with the relationship with Pacino and Williams, you never quite know whether Dormer will actually help clear Finch of the murder (which would mean sending an innocent kid to jail) and the scenes with Pacino and Williams together are excellent.The acting is first rate, Pacino is on top form and could well see his name on the nomination lists for the Academy awards, as could Robin Williams. He is brilliant in this film playing the killer, who is not your typical movie psycho. I thought that it may be difficult to take him seriously but he is really good, and proves what a top rate actor he is, not once did the words Nanu Nanu enter my head. Hilary Swanks is also very good. The rest of the cast were first rate.Overall this is a very good thriller, not once did it drag, the performances where as you would expect from Oscar winners and it had a fresh take on your typical crime thrillers. It is a brilliant remake of a well respected, if little known, Norwegian film. While not as revolutionary as Memento in its style, it is equally as watchable. This is not to be missed. 10/10",Insomnia

I do think it is worth a cinema ticket or a one time watch but personally wouldn't buy it on DVD.Good: It's very tense and the sleepless scenes have great on the effect on the narrative. Stellar performances from Robin Williams and Al Pacino. The plot is great as is the incredible ending.Bad: The reason why Al is needed is never explained and mostly the other performances are mediocre. Even though it isn't an action movie the action segments are terrible which is unfortunate com from the director of The Dark Knight trilogy.Best Part: The psychological strain Robin puts on Al while on the boat and after the false accusation.9/10,Insomnia
156,kdnor2011,Pretty Underrated for a Nolan movie,8,19 July 2012,"When it comes to Christopher Nolan's movies, Insomnia is often considered the weakest. Probably just because it's the only one of his movie's that he didn't write, he only directed. Personally I really enjoyed Insomnia, I would say it's one of my more favorite Christopher Nolan movies.Really the only big problem I have with the movie is that it's just kind of forgettable. That's the only thing I can really fault this movie for is that I forget a lot of the good stuff.It's been a while since I've seen this movie, but from what I remember, it had some really good suspense. I was always wondering how it was going to end, so in a way, being forgettable helps the movie because it allows you to go in each time and be able to enjoy the suspense. The acting was really good, I felt so sorry for Al Pacino. And it gave me a new look at Robin Williams that I haven't seen before. It was shot very well, and basically it's just a really good movie. It's not absolutely amazing, but it was suspenseful, entertaining, and well written and directed.",Insomnia
157,Mike_Devine,Nolan and Pacino could have done better,5,4 July 2017,"Al Pacino is one of the greatest character actors in the past 40 years, and while not every one of his films have been met with the same level of success, he still tries to give it his all regardless. His performance in 'Insomnia' is a good example of this.The film finds him as an LAPD detective who is nearing retirement and is called up to investigate a murder of a teen in a small Alaska town where there is 24 hours of sunlight for months at a time. The premise itself is really intriguing, and with an all-star supporting cast of Hilary Swank and Robin Williams, it's hard to go wrong. That said, the execution of 'Insomnia' is a bit clunky, as the screenplay is a major letdown. The twist is pretty easy to spot from a mile away regardless of the curve balls that are thrown into the mix. Also, it's hard to take Williams seriously in a serious role, considering he always shined when dishing out one-liners in comedies.Still, there's plenty to like about 'Insomnia.' For one, the setting in the wilderness of Alaska (or, British Columbia, to be more accurate) is a nice change from the cityscapes we're used to seeing in these kinds of thrillers, and the inner battles that Pacino's character fights while in the midst of everything else adds another dynamic to things, in addition to the lack of sleep in the midnight sun that causes even more chaos.'Insomnia' is not Christopher Nolan's best directing effort, but his signature style comes through in the thriller and it's worth a watch.",Insomnia
158,tastyhotdogs,He's so tired he can't sleep,7,28 March 2008,"""Insomnia"" is a story about a cop (Will Dormer-played by Al Pacino) sent to Alaska to help a friend solve the grizzly murder of a local teenage girl. Dormer amazes the locals, most notably young cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) and Fred (Nicky Katt) with his unorthodox methods. Dormer organises a set-up and what should be a routine capture of the main suspect goes horribly wrong when Dormer shoots his partner (Martin Donovan). Dormer covers up the unseen accidental shooting, but things get complicated when the prime suspect (Walter Finch- played by Robin Williams in his creepiest role since ""Mrs Doubtfire"") sees what happened. Finch tries to broker a deal to get himself in the clear, and a game of trickery unfolds.Not a heart racer, but certainly suspenseful and worth a watch.

When Walter Finch (Williams) keeps playing mind games with him the game keeps getting even deadly and Detective Dormer keeps having all this head that he keeps having insomnia.BOTTOM LINE: VERY GOOD!",Insomnia
162,Med-Jasta,Great spin on the genre.,10,25 September 2020,"I loved the cop working with the killer. He's playing both side trying to save himself and stop the killer. And the added element of the endless day light was another great ingredient.Pacino as usual gives an outstanding performance. He made me tired just watching him. He did great at his progression of looking more and more tired. And he does these little things you don't normally see actors do. I don't know if I can explain it. But he seems comfortable to the point that he's outside the box and it adds reality.Hilary Swank was great as the young doe eyed cop. She had that look of enthusiasm and optimism in her eyes. And the way that she always looked at Pacino. She was starting out and he was ending. You can see it in both of their faces.Robin Williams was a different but great choice. He's obviously a good actor, we've known that. But we've never seen him like this before. He has some kind of sadness in his face and voice. Something that evokes your sympathy. You didn't want to believe the he was a killer and wanted to believe his story that the murder wasn't his fault. But then his calm passivity becomes creepy and scary. You know what he did the whole time and the fact that he's this calm about it makes him scary.This has two of the best/inventive chases I've ever seen. The foggy beach and the logs in the water. Not only does it utilize the area but it's different. Chasing someone in the fog where you can't see a thing and the killer could be right in front of you is good suspense. And on the beach with big rocks so you have to keep looking where you're going.The logs in the water is everything dangerous: fast, always moving, with the threat of drowning and the ground is unstable. When he falls in the sound was very good at conveying the power of the crashing logs.This was also a good remake. They took the story, made it their own and Americanized it. I hate it when a remake doesn't add anything new. If you're going to make it in a different country, make it in a different country. Don't do what ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" did. The Norwegian one is very good and worth watching.You know you're a good director when this is your least good movie. Of course at the time this was from the guy that did ""Memento."" We had no idea what the future held for this great director's career. His talent is evident here. Any director could have made this movie but he really added those extra touches to make it stand out",Insomnia
163,smakawhat,GRIPPING!,9,25 June 2002,"Taken from the film of the same name done in Norway, Nolan re does the tale setting of an LA cop set out to help solve a brutal murder of a teenage girl in a small remote town in Alaska.  In short, Nolan creates a killer noir thriller with Pacino working his craft to perfection.  The supporting cast is great too, and hallmarks of Nolan's cinematography and suspense show up much like it did in Memento, his amazing masterpiece from last year. Excellent film, look for Pacino for an oscar nomination or maybe even a win for best actor.  Nolan is an unbelievable director.Rating 9.5 out of 10",Insomnia
164,bix171,"Good, But Let's Get Going Here",9,23 October 2002,"Christopher Nolan's follow-up to `Memento' proves he's the real deal when it comes to directing--he's got an eye for arresting images and works well with his editor--but he's going to have to wean himself off the gimmicky techniques that have distinguished him thus far. Here, the surprise provided is minor (it's cribbed from `Memento') and essentially visualizes what has been repeatedly verbalized throughout; it renders the effect as clever but showy. The theme is truth--not defining it but simply telling it, and with such a one-dimensional topic the film becomes overly moralistic, an embarrassingly simplistic adult bedtime story. Al Pacino plays an L.A. detective lent to a small-town Alaskan police force to solve the murder of a teenage girl; he brings a lot of baggage with him, mainly his partner (Martin Donovan) who intends to cut a deal on an internal affairs investigation that would probably implicate Pacino. When he accidentally kills Donovan in a stakeout, the only witness is the girl's killer (Robin Williams) who wants to cut a deal of his own. The second half, the pas-de-deux between Pacino and Williams, is where everything bogs down; like `Memento' you keep waiting for it to get to the end to see if you've matched wits. Unfortunately, you've outwitted it: it ends in the most predictable way possible. Williams brings a nice understatement to his role but Al Pacino is, as usual, Al Pacino: speaking with an accent that hints of the South, you get the impression Pacino's spent a lot of time developing a backstory to his character--too bad it doesn't seem that interesting a backstory. It would be nice to see Nolan try his hand at something outside the suspense genre lest he allow himself to get trapped into making the same film over and over again.",Insomnia
165,barberoux,Not bad,7,3 December 2002,"""Insomnia""  wasn't a bad film.  It isn't as good as the Norwegian original. I believe a close comparison between this movie and the original version is valid since there is only a few years separating them and the story has not been substantially changed.  It is inevitable to compare the two. I felt the original had a less sympathetic but more believable lead.  Al Pacino was good in his role but I think his character was meant to be played as a cop who cut corners to help society. He was really a good guy only trying to improve the overall quality of life.  The original's cop wasn't as kind. Robin Williams was OK as the bad guy. Hillary Swank was good in the role as written.  The original movie role was played as more of a seasoned cop than the neophyte played by Swank.  The discoveries made by this cop seemed more in line with her than with Ms. Swank.  This version was not as hard edged as the original but was more touchy-feely.  I also think the original was filmed a bit quirkier which I enjoy.  (SPOILER lurking ahead).  The shooting of the fellow policeman was handled better in the original.  It seemed to be much more of an accident than in this current movie.  Al Pacino's character would surely be up on charges for negligence where the original's cop was more of a victim of his partner's mistakes, though he couldn't prove it. (SPOILER warning defunct.)  Both movies are worth watching.  I gave the original a slightly better rating.  The Hollywood version was watered down and its edge blunted.",Insomnia

I don't want to comment on the story, but keep this in mind, this is not your typical serial killer film.  Al Pacino, as to be expected, is brilliant.  I actually liked Hillary Swank in this film, which I found to be shocking.  However, I was blown away with Robin Williams' creepy performance.  Insomnia has some fantastically thrilling moments, and it has enough, but not too much style, to make you want to see it again.  A surprising success.",Insomnia

Eventually he starts to receive by the killer who starts a game of cat and mouse claiming to see the shooting. Al Pacino in probably one of his most underrated roles feels the role of Will perfectly he's a cop who has his sense of justice hard boiled he doesn't beat around the bush or holds your hand. Slowly over the course of the film he descend more into a unstable state he's angry and violent,paranoid. You dive deep into his psychic the extend he goes you believe this is a man who's losing it. Hilary Swak plays a young native cop and an admirer of Dormer. Whenever you have a character like this they turn out two ways most of the time. Either their weak & incompetent or their reckless&arrogant she thankfully is neither she add a lot to the plot and is a skilled investigator. Robin Williams while he gives a great performance calm and composed it's hard to see him as murder which I guess that why Nolan chose him for the part. The shot of Alaska are beautiful. Music nice.

A one of a kind dream-like thriller that grabs us from the start and never lets go as the horrors of insomnia and small-town murder unfold. Pacino is great as usual, but Williams is the center of the spotlight in a very uncharacteristic performance as a shady writer.

170,asifahsankhan,"""You're about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a f*%king plumber!"" - Will Dormer (Al Pacino)",9,24 July 2017,"Insomnia is directed by Christopher Nolan and was released in the year 2002. Walter Finch is the antagonist of the movie and is portrayed by Robin Williams. He is a really calm and cool villain who is always one step ahead of the hero, Will Domer (Al Pacino). Don't trust him by his innocent looks as he is capable of doing much harm that you can't even imagine. Even though Insomnia remains as one of the most underrated works of Nolan till date, Walter Finch is definitely one of the finest villains ever in the movies.Instead of darkness and shadow, the movie takes place in unforgiving, continuous brightness, the 24-hour daylight of a small town in Alaska in the summer months, where a teenage girl has been discovered beaten to death, her body showing signs of ritual killing. A grizzled LA detective is brought in to show the local cops how to take down a villain this scary – a detective who has accepted this godforsaken assignment because he is in trouble with the Internal Affairs department back in the big city. His investigation goes horrifically wrong and his bad conscience, his festering awareness of career mortality and his screwed-up circadian rhythms mean that he is driven slowly mad with sleep deprivation: a kind of fatal familial insomnia of the soul.Only those people who don't suffer from insomnia have the luxury of thinking it's a disturbing metaphor – when the simple physical condition itself is what is truly disturbing. So Al Pacino is inspired casting as the haggard detective Will Dormer, the policeman with the world's most ironic name. Nolan contrives a weirdly Inception dream- like chase between the two men across logs on a freezing river, and also sets up some terrific, Michael Mann-style head-to-head clashes as Dormer tells the creepy writer exactly what he thinks of him.

I greatly enjoyed the five short extras on my DVD (a double-sided disc I bought years ago that has 'The Devil's Advocate' on the other side, yet unwatched): a conversation/interview of Nolan with Pacino; 'Day for Night: The Making of...'; 'In the Fog' (which interviewed cinematographer Wally Pfister); Nathan Crowley: production designer; and 'Eyes Wide Open' (which interviewed sleep disturbance experts), which thankfully I viewed before I watched the movie, to enhance my experience.Greatly recommended to fans of contemporary crime thrillers, regardless of whether you watched the Norwegian original or not.

172,HelloTexas11,excellent crime thriller,9,30 January 2009,"'Insomnia' is a tense murder mystery where the mystery isn't who killed whom, but rather who will find out and who will pay. Al Pacino plays LA police detective Will Dormer, admired for a long career in which he's solved many a murder case. He and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are sent to a remote Alaskan town to help find a teenage girl's killer. Dormer lives up to his hype, showing the local cops a thing or two about running an investigation, and very soon sets a trap for the killer, which works. But then, in an exciting scene set in a thick Alaskan fog, Dormer accidentally shoots and kills his partner, moments after the murder suspect has shot one of the local cops. In the confusion, it is just assumed the suspect shot both men, and Dormer does not admit his guilt. The girl's murderer, Walter Finch (Robin Williams) knows the truth however, and he escapes into the fog only to resurface later when he will blackmail Dormer. Though many elements in 'Insomnia' have popped up before, the stylish presentation and intelligent dialogue employed here make them seem fresh. The killer's taunting of the law enforcement agent pursuing him is reminiscent in some ways of 'In the Line of Fire', and the byplay between Clint Eastwood and John Malkovich. Except here it's better. Pacino's Dormer gives as good as he gets. He's not easily intimidated, even though Finch can ruin his career, even put him in prison with what he knows. There is also the added intriguing factor of the 'midnight sun,' meaning it never gets dark, which affects Dormer in particular. He can't sleep, and after a few days begins to suffer from sleep deprivation. This only adds to the plot's tension, as we wonder how long he can hold himself together. The other main character is Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), a fresh-faced, earnest Alaskan cop who is an ardent admirer of Dormer. She even wrote a thesis while at the police academy based on one of his famous cases. Her role is pivotal, especially at the end, when she discovers the truth about him. Robin Williams plays the murderer in a low-key, conversational way that is quite convincing. The scenes with him and Pacino are some of the best in 'Insomnia,' with each man trying to trip up the other, until an explosive final confrontation in which there is no more bargaining; someone has to lose. 'Insomnia' is a powerful thriller that pulls no punches, and it contains yet another bravura performance by Al Pacino.",Insomnia

Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) accidentally shots his partner Detective Eckhart (Martin Donovan) when they were catching the murderer. But Dormer doesn't admits his mistake and instead of that he gives an alibi. Local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is trying to figure out what happened that day and how/why did Dormer shoot Eckhart.Christopher Nolan delivered ""Insomnia"" after his masterpiece ""Memento"" and he really didn't left me disappointed. ""Insomnia"" is remake of Norwegian movie with the same title (with Stellan Skarsgård in main role). Since I didn't watched Skjoldbjærg's movie I cannot compare both of them but I can write some of my thoughts about Nolan's remake.You can really make psychological profile of every single character and then you can explain their behavior. So, Dormer is old detective that knows everything about his job, but he makes mistake when he accidentally shoots his partner and then cover up everything. Why? Well he cares about his reputation and he also has investigation on his back in L.A. He's bothered with insomnia and when he manages to fall asleep he always dreams that unfortunate scene. Al Pacino played Dormer with perfection. He has a perfect face to act man bothered with crime and insomnia. He's one of my favorite actors and here he shines. Man Dormer wants to catch is Walter Finch, sick man and a murderer. But Finch saw everything and Dormer must play his game. But are they so different? They both killed and they both aren't good guys. Here we have Robin Williams in not so usual role for him. But he managed to pull it off and he showed all skeptics (if those exist) what he is capable of. Opposite of Dormer and Finch there is young cop Ellie Burr, the only positive character. Although Ellie admires Dormer, she does investigation and notices irregularity in Dormer's report. She is ambitious and she eventually finds out the truth. Hilary Swank did her usually good job and she's natural talent cause she's not educated actress.At the end right people deserves to die and Dormer says the most important sentence of the movie: ""Don't lose yourself!""(or something like that), when Ellie wanted to throw the bullet away. So at the end of my comment I must recommend this movie and original too. This one because of Nolan/Pacino/Williams/Swank collaboration and the original because of...(we shall see).",Insomnia

Martin Donovan, Robin Williams and Hillary Swank have key supporting roles in this taut thriller that is among Pacino's best films. Swank is the hero-worshiping policewoman who at first admires Pacino then sees him in a different light as the investigation moves forward. Maura Tierney is also good in a brief appearance before the explosive shootout at the end of the film. The picture has a tense, throbbing music score and beautiful but subdued cinematography of the great Alaskan outdoors.",Insomnia
179,datorsiers2,A different style for Nolan.,7,31 October 2015,"Differs from other movies by Christopher Nolan, he drifts away from his usual complex plot twists and overlapping stories. It is not a bad crime/thriller movie, i just expected something more extravagant here. Insomnia really did not have that huge of an impact on Will Dormer, i expected something crazy here.Nonetheless, the movie is decent, maybe i am just a little disappointed since i love Nolan's complex, mind twisting movies. Could have incorporated something interesting regarding Dormer's insomnia, he just had some mere hallucinations and that is it. But, alright for a crime movie it was decent. Had a great cast, Al Pacino and Robin Williams outstanding as per usual, interesting to see Pacino in a movie like this, a little different for him as well, in my opinion, he played his role masterfully.Is it worth watching? Yes, it is, if you want to see Nolan/Pacino from another perspective, i recommend watching it, you will not be shocked, it is a little intense and some parts are quite interesting.",Insomnia
180,ilovedolby,Pacino and Williams give good performances!,7,18 January 2003,"For those of you who remember this film, as it came out it May, it stars Al Pacino and Robin Williams. It's the story of a detective (Pacino) who accidentally shoots his partner and kills him while pursuing a murder suspect (Williams) in a wooded area of Alaska, where the film takes place. Two things to point out here; the sun doesn't set during the time of year where this film takes place. Also, Pacino's character can't sleep because his conscience won't allow him to forget that he killed his partner, and that he blamed it on the murder suspect played by Robin Williams. It is note worthy to point out that this film does have some good performances by Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. And how can you go wrong casting Al Pacino; he's always good.  Also, Christopher Nolan directed this film. His other claim to fame was directing the critically hailed film, Memento starring Guy Pierce. My one qualm with this film, as with other films of this year, was the fact that it was a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same title. It just seems that Hollywood doesn't have too many original ideas up it's sleeve and the really good stuff is actually coming from the other side of the world now. Unfortunately, I haven't seen the original, but if it is anything like the reviews that I have read, it's supposedly excellent. ***",Insomnia
181,moviedude1,Great Alaska scenery is the backdrop for murder...,9,26 October 2003,"I thought this film was going to be one of those grisly slasher movies, but I'm glad I was mistaken!  Pacino is, as usual, on his mark!  In my mind, he's one of the best actors of all time.  This film shows why:Pacino and his LAPD partner, Donovan, are called by one of Pacino's friends to a small-town community in Alaska, where a 17-year-old-girl is murdered. Wasting no time, Pacino goes right to work, possibly wanting to take his mind off the troubles he has back home with his own affairs...The suspects dwindle, and Pacino wastes no time even further dwindling that list, but what he has left is a group of people that any one of them could have done it...or could they?Hillary Swank was the downfall to this film.  From the first time she meets with Pacino, she holds him on a pedestal, even going as far as quoting some of his previous work (even the address of a murder scene in one of his past cases).  It was obvious to everyone what a fan she was of Pacino, but they took it a little too far...Overall, this is an excellent movie!  The scenery was breath-taking (one of those, ""I wish I would have seen it on the big screen"" moments) and the characterization of Robin Williams (who was billed way too high for this film, since he doesn't enter the picture until about half-way through) as a writer was pretty good, also.  In fact, I found myself asking some pretty interesting questions throughout.Pacino fans and Williams fans alike will enjoy this film.  I gave it a somewhat-generous 9 because I lost myself in the film...I could really see something like this happening!",Insomnia

I had high expectations for Insomnia...with Al Pacino (one of my all time favorite actors), Robin Williams (who I DEFINITELY prefer in serious roles, remember ""Awakenings"") and Christopher Nolan, who did Memento...I really expected this film to be something special.  This film is simply a masterpiece.  The whole look of the film, the wonderful, engaging story and the aura that Nolan presents with his filmmaking is just brilliant.  Pacino and Williams were absolutely awesome in this film...I feel there should be Oscar nominations for these two...Pacino especially.  This film is HIGHLY recommended, I don't remember the last time I came out of a movie theater as satisfied as I was with Insomnia.  This is easily the best film I've seen so far this year.",Insomnia

This movie is terrific. The funny thing is I didn't realize how good it was until about four years later. Time has a way of blurring your memory and mine is more blurred than most. You can't forget this one however because it sticks in your head and won't come out. The cinematography is superb and the lines are, in several places, quite unique and memorable. I will always remember at the end, feeling Dormer's (Pacino) insomnia. Literally feeling it. And obviously, I've been there. I once went eight whole days without a night's sleep. Don't ask me how, but I did. And after that much sleeplessness, it begins to mess with you. I have only seen about ten minutes of the original film on which this film is based, not because I got bored and turned it off, but because I didn't realize what I was watching. If I had, I most certainly would have watched the whole thing. Robin Williams was an illogical but certainly credible, deserved, and welcome addition to this film, and anyone who says he plays something other than what he actually plays didn't pay close attention. He is always good for an unexpected performance. Do yourself a favor, study this film. Really study it. A true work of art if there ever was one on film.",Insomnia
184,Come-and-Review,Dark despite its light scenes,8,20 June 2015,"Watching first later Nolan movies, it's easy to see a decreasing amount of intensity of adult content. Warning: not sexual content, to violent and intense content. Memento was very intense, this, the next Nolan movie, is way less intense, though far higher in intensity than what you see in the dark knight trilogy.I don't know what was the original movie like, but this movie certainly was not bad. Direction managed just as in memento to bring the viewer into the character's perspective, Al Pacino acted very well, just as Robin Williams in his unusually really dark role. Visuals were very good as well, with some stunning Alaskan views.just as I said in Memento, content of this film is quite intense. To compare with other movies from Nolan, on a 1 to 100 scale: Memento is 100, Batman Begins around 30-40, Inception 35, The Dark knight 40-50, Interstellar 10, and Insomnia is a 80-90. Not that much for the amount of gore, more for the way that minimal is depicted, and how a gruesome murder is described towards the end. These two give a high-level of intensity to the movie. So expect that from it.",Insomnia
185,hemant_balz,Way better than i expected,8,8 March 2010,Insomnia!!!A decent enough crime detective story that will keep you on your toes guessing. A typically good performance by Pacino who starts feeling insomniac due to the night-less Alaska as well as the pressure of the case gets to him. He has to detect a criminal case where a homicide is been committed.Heis been send to solve the case in the small Alaskan town.He faces a lot of hurdles.Put to many challenges by the death of his partner & his link with his death.Everything good he has done in the past is put on line.He has to take certain decisions on which the case is dependent & also his values.Hilary Swank does a fantastic job as a new detective.Her performance is quite good in this movie.However Pacino steals the show with his charisma.The only weak performance i think was from Robin Williams.He never suited the role that was given to him.A job well done by Christopher Nolan.But this movie is not in the class of 'Memento' or 'The Prestige'.A good detective flick no doubt.Will Pacino be able to solve the case.And make redemption for all the things he has done in the past.

Oh, the initial crime, the murder of the young girl, is typical enough, but the players make the whole thing interesting. Al Pacino gives a brilliant performance as Will Dormer, the aging detective with sanguine experience from years of work. Robin Williams is the killer, a run of the mill minor author with poor social skills and a knowledge of forensics from his crime novels. Hillary Swank gives a new dimension to the over anxious rookie who admires Dormer, but hates the way the evidence is pointing. While not your typical crime story, the story brings a psychological depth that few films offer, an insight into the minds of the characters. Language and nudity in context are within the bounds of decency, and these days the film might have gotten a PG-14 rating instead of an R. Highly recommend this for any lover of pulp fiction.",Insomnia

It does hold ones interest, however, it is predictable and somewhat boring.  Al Pacino is aging and not as facile in his performance as he has been in the past.  Robin Williams, the villian in this movie, is playing well but it too is not his best performance.  Perhaps his next film out now has a slight edge on this sleeper.",Insomnia
189,atzimo,Read This,1,10 April 2003,"'Insomnia' could have been great. The next 'Silence of the lambs' or 'Seven'. Robin Williams' performance is what shines in this movie- Al Pacino doesn't count, his style remains the same in all his recent films. You don't see the character, you see the star Al Pacino. Of course this is not necessarily bad, as it is always a joy to watch Pacino perform.The movie is starts off in a very common and cliche way. Like another 'Silence of the lambs' clone. But then the real development begins. There is a battle between wrong and right, what is ethical and what is not. Which is something very fresh and innovative. And then comes the ending that destroys it all.I have to warn you that what follows is a spoiler, even though it might be better to know this before you watch the movie.It is common among recent thrillers that an unhappy ending closes the story. Because movies without a happy ending have the reputation of being uncompromising, artistic and even realistic, modern filmmakers feel safer to establish a pessimistic way to finish a story. The thing is that an unhappy ending, sometimes is comes off rushed and without proper justification.Take for instance 'Carlito's Way'. The ending was balanced, even though the hero struggled to escape, he had to pay for his mistakes and the ending came as a redemption. In 'Insomnia' on the other hand, the story was unfolded for us for almost two hours, to prove that there is no line between wrong and right. We worked together with the hero to realize that, but suddenly there is a u-turn in the story in a conventional morality tale way. Everything is erased there. The whole movie was a waste of time, just like in 'Road to Perdition'.And that's why this movie is worth a1/10",Insomnia
190,senortuffy,Suspense thriller delivers.,8,24 August 2003,"Al Pacino plays Will Dormer, a Los Angeles detective sent to Alaska to investigate a local murder.  He and his partner are under investigation by Internal Affairs and their captain decides they need to get out of town for awhile.  Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") directs this remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.  The title refers to the fact that they're so far north that there's 24 hours of sunlight in the summer and it's hard for newcomers to sleep.Pacino plays a familiar role, that of a world-weary cop (see ""Heat""), but he's so good at it I didn't mind.  During the course of trailing the killer, he accidentally shoots his partner who came up from LA with him.  The situation is complicated by the fact that his partner was about to testify against him for planting evidence on a murder suspect.  Dormer can't tell the truth because no one will believe him so he lies, and the lies lead to more lies and more bad police work.Other actors who turn in good performances are Robin Williams as the wacked out killer.  I never would have guessed it ten years ago, but he's turned into a pretty good character actor when it comes to creepy parts.  Hillary Swank stands out as the local police officer who idolizes Dormer - she studied his casework while in the academy.  She's young and idealistic, everything Dormer used to be, and it's interesting to see the interplay between the two as Dormer tries to hide what he knows she's going to find out eventually.The cinematography is excellent - Wally Pfister returns from ""Memento."" The Alaska scenery is overpowering, perhaps suggesting the smallness of the people who live there.  The constant daylight interspersed with dreary rain and fog accentuate the state of mind Pacino's character is going through, the mental deterioration from lack of sleep and the stress of having to hide the facts about his partner's death.  There is never any night time, and despite the attraction of the younger female cop, no romantic interest to help him forget.  It's just Pacino getting more and more stressed out.
I really enjoyed this film.  The direction and acting were excellent all around.",Insomnia
191,kergillian,A good watch,7,22 May 2002,"I went in with no expectations - I have yet to see Memento so I have nothing good or bad to say about Christopher Nolan, and although Robin Williams usually annoys the hell out of me, from the trailers for this film I figured that this character wouldn't be his usual over-manic obnoxious self.I was impressed over all. While not the best film I've seen this year, it's pretty high up. Some gorgeous cinematography (being filmed in rural Alaska didn't hurt this film at all!) although at times the occasional lack of focus and rapid cuts started to get irritating and detracted from the point they were supposed to be making.Aside from the unfortunate casting of Hilary Swank; Martin Donovan is excellent as always, Robin Williams is in his best role since the Fisher King, Al Pacino is Al Pacino (which is either good or bad, depending on whether you like Al Pacino;) and Maura Tierney is once again shamefully underused.Overall: a good film.

Fairly good story, some twists, but most of the things were excepted and that's what I resent this movie most. Although Al Pacino fits perfectly for this ""insomnia-look-a-like"" role. And he plays it with style. Pacino style. Others were pretty much unnoticed, including Robin Williams. The directing by Nolan is also on the level, though nothing special, as the rest of the movie. But, despite that, this movie is worth watching, otherwise you'll missed beautiful Alaska scenes and the legendary Pacino. Maybe I have rated this movie too low, but hey, it's a little above average, so that's why a6 out of 10. (plus applause for Pacino).",Insomnia
193,cdjh-81125,A Solid Yet Conventional Thriller,7,14 January 2017,"Christopher Nolans filmography in his short career is very varied and different he's done Sci Fi, superheros and Phycological thrillers yet this film seems much more straightforward than his other films while it's easily his worst film under Nolans hand it's solidly entertaining with some truly fantastic performances. The best thing about this film is how atmospheric it is, the touch of having the town in constant daylight reflected Pacinos inability to sleep and set this location out as different. Al Pacino gives one of his better performances in this film he's completely convincing in his gradual decline through his lack of sleep and brought a conflicted nature to his character. Robin Williams also gives one of his best performances in this film because he is so creepy and unstable in this film so he's always entertaining and engaging to watch. I will say this for the film it did do a good job at being engaging, the mystery was pretty interesting, even though we get the reveal of the murderer fairly quickly the battle between Pacino and Williams was always engaging. This film succeeds at being entertainment in its action sequences, there extremely gritty and life like. However this film does have flaws that stem mostly from the script, for one it's a fairly standard murder mystery at its core, had it not included the insomnia plot thread nothing about this film would have been truly unique. However probably my biggest issue with this film is the decisions made by Al Pacino character, we get all this build up towards him being an honest cop but after his one mistake, though fairly large, he seems to just flip 180 into a completely different person who comes across as corrupt and is in complete contradiction of itself. A fairly interesting sub plot of Williams blackmailing Pacino looked like it could be fantastic but is barely focused upon and quickly grazed over and is ultimately dropped. I know this is a fairly short review but there just not that much to talk about in this film, it's got two very good lead performances, Nolan directs to action brilliantly, it's an atmospheric film and one that is at least entertaining. The script however lets this film down with its clichés, contradictions and dropped sub plots. It's not a bad film but far from Nolans finest work. 75%/B",Insomnia
194,twanurit,I Couldn't Sleep After This One,9,3 June 2002,"This is a riveting, un-nerving, atmospheric psychological crime drama with 3 Academy-Award winners in the leads. They can count on three more nominations early next year from the Academy. Al Pacino is superlative as a detective arriving from Los Angeles to help a murder investigation in a desolate town of Alaska. Pacino's character has many hidden secrets, which would account for his haggard appearance, which worsens after a ghastly accident. Robin Williams is exceptional as a suspect, wisely underplaying the loner role, instead of resorting to over-the-top cliches. And Hillary Swank is ideal as a rookie detective. The Alaskan scenery is a character within itself, alternately beautiful and unsettling. A chase scene over floating logs will leave you breathless; supporting cast is excellent. While the ending may be a bit ""Hollywood-ish"", it hardly detracts from this mesmerizing, thought-provoking near-classic.",Insomnia
195,C22Man,No time for Sleeping,6,18 July 2016,"Right from the opening credits the mood of quiet tension never lets up. The strong contrast between the icy landscape and blood leaking all over a material isn't there just to be a cool visual. We see our protagonist Will Dormer, a weary detective whose face looks burdened by the troubles that follow him. An insomniac, hunted by internal affairs for his suspect methods and now sent to investigate a murder in a remote town where the sun never sets. It's a question of how long before he snaps. Pacino is on top form in the type of role he's always excelled in. Tough and experienced after years in the job, but emotionally vulnerable and perpetually on the edge for exactly the same reason. His younger partner Eckhart is willing to dish out information on him. The turning point comes when a trap set for the killer goes wrong and Dormer kills Eckhart after mistaking him in the fog. There's no doubting that it was an accident, but Dormer knows that with the case against him he has no chance of making such a claim. He manages to just about suppress his guilt and concoct a story that lets him off clean. There's one major problem for him however, the killer knows that he did it.Insomnia isn't just a moody title, it's a reflection of Dormer's mind-set as a whole. How a man's mental state has become so damaged that his morality and ethics have become blurred. It questions how far he's willing to go to do what he knows is right deep down, even if it goes against the very principles he's lived by his entire life. The permanent daylight of Alaska serves to highlight his insomnia in a visual sense, bringing it to forefront so there's no place for him to hide. Too often films of this ilk try to add some kind of quirk or motif without giving it a reasoning or representation. But it's something that is handled impressively here.Bar Pacino, two performances really standout. The first being Hilary Swank as the plucky Ellie Burr, a role she plays to perfection. She never goes for the typical rookie cop trying to impress, she instead plays it audacious but collected, someone who wants to do the right thing but understands the difficulties that come with the job. The second is Robin Williams as the killer Finch. It never ceases to amaze me how someone so funny can reach such depths and play such disturbed characters. It's comparable to his part in 'One Hour Photo', released the same year. He takes an understated approach, making Finch more unnerving than raving and it works in give the role an edge.The relationship between Dormer and Finch actually turns out to be one of the highlights. We very rarely get a thriller that makes such a valid connection between the hero and villain. It is clear that the two of them share the same psychological problems. Insomnia haunts their every step. Notably their both trying to achieve the same thing, clearing their names. Finch wants to people to think he's innocent and Dormer wants to pin Eckhart's death on anyone but himself. Their relationship is fascinating for how manipulative it is. Both latch on to each other despite appearing to be polar opposites because they need to work together to survive. There are a couple of occasions where things can happen a little too conveniently or the plot ties together too neatly. Some of the action sequences feel a little out of place given the tone, though the chase across the logs is handled excellently. Nolan's reliance on the bigger picture can sometimes lead to the little details being forgotten about or hastily connected. However the story itself is a nice antidote to his previous film 'Memento'. While that film was chained so tightly to its gimmick that there was no room for anything to breathe or develop, Insomnia is much sparser and atmospheric. More interested in building tension through fog and isolation. It allows the characters to soak up the ghostly settings and for that to play into their psychology.Why the film drew Nolan's attention is obvious. It plays on themes that he finds interesting, mainly the troubled morality of the central character. Whereas most thrillers are interested in the details of the investigation and the crime, Insomnia makes a wise choice to instead examine the mind-set of Dormer and how he is distressed by his choices. The brightness proves a crucial aspect. Despite the murky underside of the case, the light is always on Dormer. He has nowhere to hide his feelings, even sleep has rejected him.",Insomnia
196,FeverDog,Isn't the original always better? *SPOILERS*,6,25 May 2002,"What a disappointment!I'll keep this short:1. I never for a moment bought the idea of Robin Williams as a killer. He came off exactly as he was - a fallen star looking to regain street cred in an edgy thriller. Still, it was better than seeing him with a red rubber nose though.2. The Hollywood Influence. The Pacino character is completely softened from the original. Examples: A) The dog being shot is already dead. B) The killer, not the cop, plants false evidence in the boyfriend's home. C) The underage best friend hits on the cop, not the other way around. D) The desk clerk is not roughed up by the cop in abortive sex scene. God forbid America's protagonists have some unsavory qualities.3. The Hollywood Influence II: Must every movie be loaded with unnecessary profanity? I don't remember ""f---"" being said dozens of times in the original; I also don't remember anyone complaining about the lack of cursing in the original.4. The Gratuitous Chase Scene. Yeah, the romp over the wet logs was a cool set piece in itself (although it reminded me of a similar sequence in STAKEOUT), but what exactly was the point of it? Williams escapes, only to agree to meet with Pacino later on the ferry. Why would he do this? To insert an unnecessary chase to sate America's need for action, I guess. This scene is neither included nor needed in the original - this is supposed to be a psychological thriller, not a conventional action flick.5. Instead of the main character having to live with himself after his amoral actions, this version has Pacino die at the end, alleviating the weight of his conscience.That's enough for now. Should I have compared the two movies so liberally? The '97 version (8/10) being shown on IFC before I headed out to the 'plex probably didn't help matters. But even if I had never seen the foreign version, I'd still would have had a strange sense of deja vu. Nolan's INSOMNIA cribs from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (cop finding clues in dead girl's bedroom, unsuspecting heroine enters bad guy's home), SEVEN (knocking on bad guy's door at moment bad guy comes home that leads to a chase in murky dampness, after which bad guy calls cop at bad guy's home), and TV's TWIN PEAKS (in sleepy mill town girl is sleeping with boyfriend of now-dead best friend which is discovered by detective called in from big city).But if you're looking for some great footage of lush Alaskan wilderness, you've got cause to rejoice. The gorgeous cinematography here is the one aspect that surpasses the original. Props to Wally Pfister for all the evocative atmosphere he's created.OK, so this wasn't very short. Sorry.6/10",Insomnia
197,Kirasjeri,Movie is GOOD; PACINO IS GREAT,8,4 July 2002,"Al Pacino is clearly now the front runner for Best Actor Award. He is simply marvelous in this film as a tortured detective.In Alaska there was a murder, and two detectives from Los Angeles are sent to assist. (I was never sure why!). The problem is that there has been an Internal Affairs Investigation and the younger member of this team is likely to testify against the Pacino character. So when while chasing the killer that detective is shot (accidentally?) by Pacino we and he are left to wonder about the motivation.Pacino, who previously falsified evidence to convict a known killer (why the IA investigation) now falsifies more evidence to coverup his shooting of the younger detective - the twist is that the killer knows this and begins to blackmail Pacino, who can't sleep either due to the lack of sunsets at the that high a latitude (this is Alaska) or his guilty conscience. We are never sure of which, and neither is he.Pacino is marvelous. Hilary Swank good. Robin Williams is creepy as the killer who it turns out is just as much a tortured ambiguous soul as the Pacino one is. This is not a film with black and white borders regarding morality and right and wrong, although at the climax Pacino makes an attempt to clarify that issue in his own mind.The plot works. The setting in Alaska does a good job in giving the feeling of isolation Pacino feels, and he is simply wonderful.Almost certainly ""Insomnia"" will be regarded as a Film Noir classic.",Insomnia
198,piratecannon,Sleep Will be the Last Thing on Your Mind,9,29 December 2012,"Christopher Nolan wasn't always directing caped crusaders and dreamworld desperadoes. Once upon a time (nine years ago to be exact) he was at the helm of a criminally underrated crime thriller by the name of Insomnia.Starring Al Pacino as a L.A. detective who travels to a remote Alaskan town to help identify the killer of a teen, this is one of Pacino's most recently truly great performances (a shame, I know). Hilary Swank and Robin Williams co-star as an up-and-coming local policewoman and deranged author (respectively), and both do a superb job of keeping pace with the venerable titan of Tinseltown.What's particularly effective here is the excellent use of setting. In Nightmute (sounds inviting, huh?), because of its far-northern location, the sun doesn't set for long periods of time. This causes Detective Dormer (Pacino) to eventually start falling apart at the seams, as the sun seems to penetrate every effort he makes to lose himself in restful slumber. This naturally ties into a specific subtext that reveals much about Dormer's personality and tainted past as a detective, and it's very refreshing to see the usual them of darkness giving way to light flipped on its head.The problem with writing a review of Insomnia is that I can't detail too much about what unfolds (in terms of plot) without ruining some of the major twists that lend genuine weight to the story as it ambles along some truly dark and disturbing corridors. Don't let the analogy fool you, though; there's nothing slow about the pacing, and it's wholly engrossing from start to finish. The sense of impending slumber is imminent, though, and this heightens the tension in the third act when ""truth"" starts to become a relative term for our exhausted protagonist.Insomnia isn't nearly as stylish as Nolan's most recent offerings, but it's certainly ably directed and its tale is spun with maximum efficiency. If, for one reason or another, this gem that originally shone almost a decade ago has eluded your radar, be sure to check it out.As for myself, it's time to get a little shut-eye.",Insomnia
199,rcolgan,"""A good cop can't sleep because he's missing a piece of the puzzle. And a bad cop can't sleep because his conscience won't let him.""",9,2 July 2014,"Nolan seems like he's a director who can do no wrong. Every film he's done has been a unique work with beautiful directing and complex scripting constantly trying to be different. Insomnia is no exception demonstrating once again why Nolan is one of the masters of modern cinema. Al Pacino leads as the veteran cop who is sent to an isolated town to investigate a child's murder with his partner. During this he is under investigation from internal affairs who his partner may be cooperating with. The pressure of this begins to take hold as the case goes on, trying to hide all his secrets. Whilst it was not written by Nolan, it is a story well suited for him to handle. Just like any Nolan film, it tackles meaningful themes of morality and guilt throughout with Pacino's veteran cop becoming conflicted on his own beliefs.Once again Pacino demonstrates why he is one of the best actors, with his character becoming more worn down as the film goes on. The look of his eyes alone show how exhausted he is and that the lies have taken his life away.Though as impressive as Pacino was, Williams is probably the biggest surprise of the film giving a chilling portrait of a serial killer who steals the show whenever he's on screen. It's very different to his usual role, but he plays it incredibly with an eerily calm demeanour and incredible dialogue delivery giving a memorable portrait of a killer. The killer works as an effective reflection of the veteran cop for both of them are trying to hide their own lies. The only difference being that whilst Pacino feels guilt for his lies and actions, the killer feels none. Insomnia is a masterpiece in filmmaking from start to finish. The directing, performances and writing come together with everyone involved in the film giving it their A game.",Insomnia

So don't expect this review to give much more than a feeling for who most of the characters are and the general atmosphere.The film opens with detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart being flown over some lovely but forbidding landscape in a twin engine float plane, discussing an investigation that Internal Affairs is doing on them back in Los Angeles. They arrive in Nightmute, Alaska, and are met by a junior detective named Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) who is a big fan of Dormer's -- even having written a paper on one of his cases when she was at the police academy. Dormer looks tired already, and he hasn't even figured out yet that the sun won't set during his entire stay in this town.The case they have been sent here to help out on is a murder of a high school girl. The very early parts of the investigation are routine, with the Los Angeles cops bringing a great deal of expertise to bear, helping the locals see what they may have missed or assumed. Then the aforementioned event happens, and the film becomes more interesting and also much more tense.The performances are good, though unremarkable. Pacino is unable to sleep (hence the film's title), and becomes more and more tired as the days go by, and this seems believable. Swank is fine but isn't given as much to work with, except perhaps in one brief scene near the end. I did like Paul Dooley (who played the father in ""Breaking Away"") in the small role of the local police chief.This film was directed by Christopher Nolan, whose previous film was the outstanding ""Memento."" This is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, which is available on DVD but which I have not seen. This film doesn't use as obvious of a hook as did ""Memento,"" but it does frequently use short flash images to show what Dormer is thinking about. Not all of these images make sense at first, but eventually things do come together. And speaking of images, the cinematography is very good, especially of the Alaskan countryside (although much of the film was shot in British Columbia).This film is very good, to the extent that I have been very close to giving it another half star. It's mostly gone from the theaters here, so see it soon if you can.Seen on 6/23/2002.",Insomnia
201,imagiking,Insomnia: Flawed But Acceptable Remake,5,26 July 2010,"As mentioned in my review of this film's 1997 Norwegian parent, of late I am deeply interested in the similarities and differences between foreign language films and their American remakes. With a fondness for both Scandinavian cinema and Al Pacino, the Insomnias were an obvious case to investigate.Remaining faithful to its forebear in terms of the main plot, Insomnia gives us Detective Will Dormer, assigned to the investigation of a 17 year old girl's murder. Amidst difficulty adjusting to the midnight sun of Alaska, an unfortunate accident forces him to lie about his actions. He becomes haunted by both his guilt and the threatening musings of the girl's murderer, who knows the truth.An interesting opening credits sequence combines images of a bloodstained fabric with the beautiful Alaskan setting this remake calls home. A fair answer to the original's setting, the remote wilderness offers incredible scenery, its iciness as entrancingly mysterious as the unexplained sanguine fibres. The first and most noticeable difference to set this apart from its Norwegian counterpart is the female detective, played here by Hilary Swank. Despite Swank's entirely likable performance, one cannot help but lament this change of direction. The original character's austerity was her strength; the alternative's naivety her weakness. The mentor-student dynamic which forms between Pacino and she is, while unique and understandable, far less effective than the tension of the original relationship. Due to a combination of the newly introduced IA subplot, the dropping of the retirement age and concomitant hearing problems of the main detective's partner, and the lack of an American gun ban, Dormer's ""accident"" and whether it is indeed that becomes more the focus of attention than the guilt of Engström's. Additionally, the original's heavy usage of insomnia in a metaphorical sense is largely replaced here by its physical effects. More realistic? Probably. More effective? Absolutely not. It only really comes into play in the finale, an action filled Hollywood shootout that drags a flawed but acceptable remake down in its last act. Pacino's latter-day madness is on full display here, much different to Skarsgård and, much as I love Al, a less compelling performance. Now Williams, however, takes his part and flies with it, bringing something new and creative to his adaptation: one of disappointingly few improvements upon the original film. An intoxicatingly interesting point to be made is that the dead dog into which Dormer shoots his decoy bullet replaces a live one shot by Engström: a fascinating difference which speaks volumes, both about the difference in characterisation and the allowances and tolerances of the respective film industries.As a remake, Insomnia is certainly poorer than its source, replacing some key plot points with less effective ones and adding an ending which is as trashy as the one it replaces is superb. Standing alone as its own work, it mostly manages to present its ideas decently and entertainingly, crafting a film better than much of the other schlock that gets churned out. If only we lived in a better world, the budget of this could have gone to distributing the original. C'est la vie, alas...",Insomnia

203,brandon_lee420,This film will give you Insomnia!,7,30 April 2010,"Who doesn't love Al Pacino? Anyone.....Come on..... there at least should be one hater! Guess there is not. Al Pacino is loved by everyone who has seen him as ""Michael Vito Corleone"" in The Godfather Trilogy or the ruthless ""Tony Montana"" in Scarface. These films were the highlights of his career and even though he isn't as memorable as Will Dormer in Insomnia, it is hard not to give him an honorable mention. Insomnia is referred to as a ""Cat and Mouse"" thriller and it proved that it is one because of the whole chase thing between Will Dormer, a cop, and a local writer who goes by the name of Walter Finch, a man who is under the suspicion of killing a teen. This is proved even more when there is an actual ground chase between them two on the logs in the flowing river. That scene was full of heart pounding action and added a bit of intrigue that made you appreciate the film a little bit more. The film would have been unknown to me if there weren't the three Oscar winners, Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank that made this thriller for what it is, also if Christopher Nolan hadn't directed it. He is truly a great director. Steven Spielberg has to watch out for the might of Nolan. Al Pacino was absolute and admirable in Insomnia therefore making him the best actor in the whole film. His role as a tough cop was fascinating and hypnotizing. Robin Williams, who portrays Walter Finch, was not as great as Al's however he still doesn't disappoint. This is not Robin Williams best role but it MIGHT be his most evilest role in his ""Evil Trilogy"". Hilary Swank's character Ellie Burr made you think that she was unnecessary but as the film reaches its climax you realize that she plays an important part. Swank's performance could not rival against her other roles in ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Boy's don't Cry"" however she is agreeable but not fun to watch. The films chilly, or spooky, atmosphere is the best in any movie, I have ever seen so far. It just makes the films setting really home-sweet-home. The scenery at the beginning was beautiful as the plane flew over the ice and glaciers of Alaska.In Nightmute, Alaska, seventeen year old resident Kay Connell is found murdered. As a favor to the local Nightmute police chief, two Los Angeles Robbery Homicide police detectives, Will Dormer and Hap Eckhart, are called in to assist in the investigation. Although renowned in the police world, both Dormer and Eckhart are facing some professional issues back in Los Angeles. In Nightmute, Dormer has a major case of insomnia due to a combination of the incessant midnight sun and from a secret he is carrying. This insomnia is causing him to be delusional. Something he is not dreaming about is that the murderer has contacted him, informing him all about the murder and the fact that he knows everything that is going on with Dormer. They begin a symbiotic relationship in keeping secrets for each individual's benefit. But ambitious young local detective, Ellie Burr, might piece the story together on her own.",Insomnia

The meeting on the ferry between the two is reminiscent of the scene in ""Heat"" with Pacino and DeNiro...you're expecting fireworks and instead you get underplay. Once again, it works beautifully.

Al Pacino was riveting in his performance and I was able to feel his pain of what was happening to him throughout the duration. I thought this was one of Robin Williams better roles considering how I usually can't stand him except for say ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", ""Good Will Hunting"", and ""Patch Adams"". Hilary Swank did fine but as was said before, her character was fairly limited. She played the adorable apt pupil in high regards. The plot kept me intrigued and the dialog was clever for the most part. I still don't know anyone who can give an emotional-driven speech like Al! I recommend this film to anyone that likes police suspense movies and all Pacino fanatics like myself.Final Call:Movies: Would be worth the ticket price.DVD Purchase: Of course!Rental: A perfect choice.",Insomnia

But ""Insomnia"" is something completely else. The leading roles are for Al Pacino and Robin Williams, who are giving the best of the best performances! Furthermore there is two times Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank. So far the cast, now let's say something about the story, which is truly remarkable. It's brilliantly written and it will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.This is without any doubt the best Pacino-movie of the last few years. Pacino and Williams are an excellent on-screen duo. It's a shame this movie received hardly any awards for the acting performances. This was the second time I watched ""Insomnia"", so I knew the story, but that didn't bother. I still loved it! To conclude I would like to give a quote I loved a lot: ""Life is so important.

209,dalton2,Finally I could see a good thriller,8,25 October 2002,"Some days ago Woody Allen came to Spain to receive the prestigious Príncipe de Asturias Award, and he had time to express his personal opinion about Hollywood today. His recent film Hollywood Ending is a clear critic of what Hollywood has become. I have to say that I agree with him. Films are more and more expensive, but the results are worse and worse. It seems like there are no good writers yet, and films like The Red Dragon (which I saw today in its Spanish première) are -in my modest opinion, of course- a demonstration on how empty of ideas a film can be. But Insomnia is an exception among dozens of low quality films. It has a really good screenplay, with very good original ideas, and, also, the printed result is great. Al Pacino is splendid (does he overact a bit or is it just my imagination? Maybe it's only my imagination). Robin Williams is correct, he does his role well (it's his second bad guy role in just a few months) and the rest of the cast are also quite good. The opening scene is simply captivating. And the edition of the whole film is wonderful. It's a pleasure to see the first minutes of Pacino's scenes, full of short shots perfectly combined with plenty of subtle details. I enjoyed the whole film since it began until it ended. Nice story, perfect screenplay, solid acting, good music, wonderful cinematography and editing and good directing. A really good film. One of the best this year. 8-9 out of 10.",Insomnia
210,HanShotFirstGR,Very underrated film in general despite not being one of Nolan's best,8,15 April 2021,"Plot:Two Los Angeles homicide detectives are dispatched to a northern town where the sun doesn't set to investigate the methodical murder of a local teen.Analysis:This movie came out as the American remake of a Scandinavian police mystery thriller. The majority of those remakes are laughably worse than the original content but this is a great example how a good director can add to a movie's mythology by remaking it without destroying it.The story is quite interesting because it starts as an ordinary mystery movie but quickly turns to something far more. All of Christopher Nolan movies have that one unique detail that makes them feel way more thrilling than the average movie and even this one which is a remake seems very close to a Nolan's screenplay. The part about the main character's insomnia -that also named this movie- expands the mythology of the film and works nicely as this detail that makes it great and memorable. It may not have the mindblowing element of The Prestige or Inception but it does have some deep philosophical background behind this choice and that makes it a worthy entry for Nolan's catalog.The characters were pretty solid. The main investigator is Will Dormer played by Al Pacino and while it's not a performance like those of his prime, is a nice example of how talented and versatile he can be, he brings out the badass, the clever and the paranoid side of Will and makes it feel so natural that gets you more invested in this movie. The character has a very interesting, unpredictable and original arc, it seems like something never seen before and plays a major role is this movie's success.Christopher Nolan as a director has never produced something not worth watching, even his least interesting attempts are very watchable and quite enjoyable, so it was no surprise that he managed to create a beautiful thriller out of this screenplay. His wide pretty shots capturing the magic of this town, his unique way to depict feelings and states of mind, his creative use of camerawork and his dark-themed vision help this movie to be great. Even for those who don't get too excited with murder mysteries this is a very different one that will definetely intrigue you at least a little bit and for the fans it's kind of a guaranteed entertaining experience, very unique and not forgettable at all.This is a very underrated movie, not just because of the imdb score, but also because it never gets mentioned as a good Nolan movie and that's a pitty. Surely, in a catalog with many near-perfect movies, Insomnia in nowhere near Nolan's best film but in general it's a very good one. There might be a few problems in pacing but nothing that big for someone to not enjoy the movie, it's a non-stop interesting story that never gets boring and keeps you at the edge of you seat constantly, all the important elements for a very good thriller movie.Conclusion:It's an underrated gem that can be very satisfying for a fun time with a fresh story. A rare exception of the rule about American remakes that should get more attention, not just because of a very good Al Pacino and the signature direction of Christopher Nolan, but also for a clever idea and a great screenplay. Give it a try and be prepared for something good, just not in the level of other Nolan's masterpieces. If only every remake of a foreign movie was as good as this one.Rating: 8/10.",Insomnia
211,AbhiMathews,Clear Cut,5,23 November 2014,"Insomnia is almost a collage of several other mystery films (namely Se7en) tied into one, but not distinctively. Although it wasn't completely repetitive, it was as cliché as detective work goes, and the movie didn't stand out one way or another. Whether it's the elusive murderer on the loose or the mentally plagued cop who's trying his best, this movie is predictable and lacks ingenuity. Accompanying the lack of creativity, the prime actors and actresses had average performances and the emotional conviction in the roles was often lacking. A straight plot followed by routine dialogue made Insomnia rather mundane and an effort to watch. Although there were particular exciting scenes, they were rather short and sparse. The resources were there, but execution was a miss.Whether it's L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects, Se7en or any other great mystery movie, these all had a strong emotional attachment that hook viewers into truly empathizing with the protagonists and mystery at hand. Unfortunately in Insomnia, it's almost like you already know the fate of the characters, and still don't care.",Insomnia
212,darkjosh,More Great Work From Nolan; Masterful Work From Pacino,8,29 May 2002,"Al Pacino has always been known and rewarded for his loud, showy, abrasive, and larger-than-life characters.  He's garnered Oscar nominations for big, in-your-face roles such as in Dick Tracy and The Godfather, and finally won for Scent of a Woman, in which his gargantuan, wild performance literally carried an otherwise average film.  That's why it's such a shock and treat to see him playing the lead character, Detective Will Dormer, in Insomnia as a man so lost and broken in spirit that you can see the failure, defeat, and exhaustion on his face.  This isn't a variation of his shouting, impassioned, bordering-on-caricature personas; it's a performance of subtlety and depth as he slowly becomes bogged down by both guilt and lack of sleep.  In short, it may be Pacino's best performance of his career.L. A. detectives Will Dormer and partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) arrive in the small Alaskan town of Nightmute (sumptuously photographed) to assist local police in the murder of a young girl. The town is in the middle of a 6-month period of constant twilight, with the sun never going down and light pervading all, adding to Dormer's sleeplessness. Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank, in a perfunctory role), a rookie cop, serves as their guide and helps with the investigation.  Dormer and Eckhart are in conflict; Eckhart threaten sto give information to the LAPD about misconduct on Dormer's part.  During a chase for the killer, Dormer accidentally shoots his partner.  The killer sees this, and uses it to blackmail him into helping him flee police capture.At the midway point, the murderer is revealed, and is played by Robin Williams.  Again, here is a performer known for his energetic and spontaneous work in a variety of comedy and family films.  Under Nolan's direction, Williams turns in a creepy cool performace, underplaying his role and imbuing the character with an intangible, offbeat quality.  With the two main performers doing such quality work, it's sad that Hillary Swanks' role was not more fleshed out.  Her job is too basically be in peril when the script calls for it or act suspicious.  It's not so much that it's a poorly written character, it's just that  a great performer deserves a great role.Director Christopher Nolan has directed another fine thriller with Insomnia. Of course its much more conventional than Memento, but that's to be expected and really can't be held against a top-notch mindgame such as this. He gets fantastic performances out of his cast, especially Pacino with his masterful onscreen deterioration of his character. A well-paced and engrossing film, with just the right amount of action and  a fascinating and thoughtful psychological dance between the two main characters. Nolan is filling the niche he carved himself in the suspense genre with more quality work.8 out of 10",Insomnia

214,boondocksaint20,A decent film that could have been a great film,7,31 May 2002,"After seeing Insomnia, I had one of those feelings of limbo, wondering to what degree I liked this film.  After seeing Memento, I decided that anything Christopher Nolan writes, I will see, since that was one of the most brilliant movies of my time.  But, Insomnia, though similar in a few aspects, is a totally different movie.First off, I will list the positive qualities of this film.  The acting by the main leads is wonderful.  Robin Williams, in my opinion, was the highlight of the film, as a super cunning murderer, who has an everyday quality about him...this is what made him so chilling, was thinking that you may know a guy like that right next door to you, someone very friendly, but oddly private at the same time.  He did an excellent job, and did not have enough screen time in my opinion.  Hillary Swank was surprisingly good and likeable, and Pacino, who usually gives a great performance as basically himself, was a little better than average this time around.  The film has wonderful scenery that adds to the spooky isolation in the film.  Plus, it has a few hidden messages,(***spoiler ahead) like when we find out that his insomnia was not due to the constant sunlight in alaska, but due to his conscious...I thought the best part of the film was when Hillary Swank quoted Pacino in that there are two types of cops who can't sleep, one's that are trying to solve a mystery, and those with a guilty conscious.  It was brilliant when the waitress flips the light on in Pacino's room, and the screen is almost overwhelmed with light, giving him an epiphany in justifying his sleep depriavtion. (End spoiler***).The movie is at its best when Williams is on the screen, coniving with Pacino in the coverup that will save both of their lives.  If only they included more scenes of Williams tormenting Pacino though, it would have been better.Okay, now for the negative.  This film, though keeps your attention for the most part and is pretty entertaining at times, is not a thriller at all. It is more of an analyzation of our protagonist's psyche, though we don't get an in depth look, we mainly observe from a third person perspective and draw our own conclusions.  The debate on whether he purposely killed his partner is ludicrous, it is very obvious if you think about it, but that's all I'll say.  It is never resolved, and was poorly executed and Pacino just doesn't act like this corrupt cop that we're supposed to see him as, we once again, observe the present and just have to accept it.The film also drags a little in parts.  Not that it mattered to me, but the film has barely any action and no suspense, unlike what was implied in the previews, though there are the occasional bloody flashbacks, which get annoying after we've seen them for the hundredth time.  The ending was so predictable, a major disapointment.  And here's the big one...there are no characters to root for at all.  Even the most honorable of viewers will have a hard time rooting for Swank to solve the case, though she was definitely a charmer on the screen, I almost wanted the film's asset (Williams) to succeed, only b\c he was such an interesting character that had such a diagolically ingenius plan.  The film just doesn't carry the weight it should, it lacks substance and profiles for our characters...we rarely feel their pain, we just see or hear about it in the movie.All in all, not a bad film, definitely worth seeing once, but it just was not what I was expecting from such a talented writer/director.  It is entertaining, very entertaining in some parts, but the entertainment just doesn't flow through the movie...it doesn't feel like a mystery, nor suspense, not even so much a character study, it just shows a situation and how the two main leads work to resolve it, though, an entertaining situation at that.  It's good for a single viewing when it goes on dvd.  This movie could have been a 10, but I'll have to give it a 7 for the acting, the scenery and William's scheme; it loses big on the payoff, unfortunately.",Insomnia

However, the film starts to go downhill shortly after we learn the detective's secret and he subsequently kills his partner, who is going to testify against him. The killing may or may not be accidental and we are now thrust into the detective's guilt trip over the circumstances and his implausible 'strange bedfellow' agreement with the young woman's killer.

216,tml_pohlak_13,A bone-chilling masterpiece,10,18 May 2009,"Al Pacino is an L.A. cop who's come to Alaska with his partner to investigate a brutal homicide. Hilary Swank is the Alaskan detective who admires his work and methods. Robin Williams is the killer they're hunting down. (All three are Oscar winners by the way, and deliver performances that are definitely worthy of an Oscar.) Throughout the film, Pacino's character's mind wreaks havoc; the Alaskan town is so far up north, they get ""white nights"" (I.e. the sun doesn't set for half the year). As a result, he cannot sleep.With ""Insomnia"", Christopher Nolan joins my list of directors I admire. ""Insomnia"" owes much of its stunning success to the directorial choices Nolan makes. The most difficult task of the movie is this: how exactly can you show the audience Pacino's increasingly disoriented, sleepless mind-frame, without boring them? I think Nolan handles this expertly.The cast deliver stellar performances, in particular Robin Williams. His character is undoubtedly psychotic. What a temptation for Williams to steal the show with a display of angry shouting, of pure psychopathic hostility, of maniacal laughter! But no. He avoids this and goes for a far different touch. His character talks of extremely disturbing things in a very calm, matter-of-fact way, making his performance far more bone-chilling. As much as I love Williams' comic roles, I have to admit he's practically unrivalled in ""serious"" acting.Another thought: although this is a film I like to consider a thriller, it is very much like a film noir as well. Personally, I love the plots of film noirs, but I can't stand the relentless usage of shadows and dark lighting. ""Insomnia"" shatters these guidelines. It is a very dark film with lots and lots of light. The effect is interesting to say the least.This film is a thriller, and consequently, I'm choosing my words carefully in order to spoil as little of the film as possible. I highly recommend seeing this film— I was blown away. ""Insomnia"" is also very deep, powerfully invoking themes of guilt and restlessness. I do not regret buying this film: I confidently call it a great movie.Note: Apparently, ""Insomnia"" is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgård.

219,RolloTomasi,the anti-summer movie,10,31 May 2002,"""Insomnia"" is not the kind of movie you expect to see this time of year. It's the kind of dark film studios usually save for fall release. The logic is that a) audiences are expecting more serious, dark material that time of year and b) it's positioned better for Oscar attention. Something has happened this summer, though. We seem to be getting back to the idea that summer is not just the time for dumbed-down action. It's the height of the movie box office season, period. If a movie is good, it has the best chance of being seen during this season. That has not been the way things have gone in recent years. The high-profile release of ""Insomnia"" release may be a sign that major movie studios have finally wised up.This summer, if schedules hold, we'll get Cold War thrillers ""Sum of All Fears"" and ""K-19: The Widowmaker."" We'll get the first major studio, serious crime film in a while, ""Road to Perdition.""  Are the days finally gone that true movie fans must spend spring and summer waiting for anything good to watch, settling for what amounts to garbage? I'm hopeful.By the way, I loved ""Insomnia."" It's the best film of the year so far. The film is a rare instance of a project living up to and far exceeding its potential. Sometimes the collaboration of great talent actually creates something great.Director Christopher Nolan, who only four years ago released his first film, ""Following"" on a shoestring budget shot with friends over a year of weekends. Only one print was made of the film at the time. Not knowing this, I was lucky enough to see it screened back in 1998 at a theater in Santa Monica. Only two other people were in the theater. The night before I saw it, Nolan held a Q & A session after the screening. I'm kicking myself now for not attending that. If only I'd had any idea what would happen next. In 2000, at the Toronto Film Festival, came ""Memento,"" and everything changed. A couple of struggling producers named Clooney and Soderbergh immediately recognized Nolan as having big-time potential and tapped him to direct ""Insomnia,"" their remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name.I saw ""Insomnia"" on Memorial Day Sunday. The theater was packed.So now here is Nolan, having directed three Academy Award winners in a thriller that found itself taking advantage of a Memorial Day weekend left wide open by schedule shifts. The choice to release it at such a time would not have been made had this film not been so good. I believe that the studio took a look at it and said, 'this is great, people are going to love this. Now, when can we open?'Despite its big stars and probably big budget, ""Insomnia"" is remarkably tight. There's a subdued, perfectly channelled intensity throughout. Stylistically it's only a few clicks removed from `Memento.'

It has a overarching theme and message perfectly fitting the characters, making them believable and likeable despite their flaws. The acting is convincing, the dialogue however is less so.The main issue is certainly the pacing, as it feels very drawn out, especially expressing the issue central to the movie - insomnia. However, the doubt that was attempted to be caused as a result of it did not come across well and was not at all convincing. This could have made a significant impact on how the movie and what the protagonist sees would have been interpreted. Unfortunately, this aspect fell completely flat and thus the issue of insomnia felt very much unneeded.",Insomnia

223,crypticcrytic,How about a 2:30 AM screening?,8,29 May 2002,"There's trouble in tinsel town and an internal investigation is the real motive behind transporting two detectives from L.A. to Nightmute, Alaska to help on a murder case. Veteran detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are under suspicion of major mischief and having the inside scoop, respectively. And that also impacts the dynamic between them.Rookie detective Ellie Burr (Hillary Swank) is sent to help thaw them out from their harrowing ride from sunny California to Nightmute. She's clearly star struck with Will ever since she studied his landmark cases in the academy and follows his lead, which almost takes her life.With this collection of Oscar Winners (Pacino, Swank, Williams), you know that we've either got a runaway winner or a complete snoozer. Director Christopher Nolan prevents the latter but the former is never really achieved. Ellie tells Will, ""Good cops can't sleep because they're missing a piece of the puzzle; bad cops because their conscience."" Presumably, it was from Will's own pen, but by the fourth day of sleeplessness, he can't remember much of anything. He's can't tell the good guys from the bad ones and he surely doubts his own innocence.This one may make money at the box office but it's flawed. You will feel Will's agony growing throughout. You will suspect his motives as the days blur on. You will sense Ellie's instincts overtaking her admiration as the evidence mounts. You will love the mentoring role Will plays for Ellie without crossing the bounds of professionalism. His urgings for her to pay attention to the small stuff will help undermine him in the end.But Pacino and Williams make strange bedfellows. We see no synergy and instead, there's less to this combination than the sum of their parts. Nevertheless, it's a good story with strong performances and scary sequences.Now let me rest.",Insomnia
224,KillerLord,"Pacino, Williams and Nolan - a Great Team Indeed!",9,8 October 2008,"This Insomnia, directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Al Pacino and Robin Willaims is a remake of an original Insomnnia movie. I have not been able to see the original movie and hence I cannot draw any comparisons between the original one and this one. But I guess that it is good in one way since I get to think about the movie without any prejudice at all. This movie is one of the most remarkable movies I have seen and indeed showcases Christopher Nolan as an upcoming director. Robin Williams and Jim Carrey are actors known for their comedy. And another common thing to them is that when they decide to step into roles other comedy, they produce masterpieces indeed. Robin Williams plays the role of an author of crime novels who has also killed a young girl. He has a dark and a negative role and plays a character who is very straightforward and calculative. And boy oh boy, does he manage to convince us in this role. It is one of the best roles of Robin Williams I have seen. I must confess his roles in Bicentennial Man and One Minute Photo and this role are in fact much better than his typical comedy roles. He has showcased some amazing acting skills in this movie. Al Pacino is of course among the finest actors in the whole world. And needless to say, he delivers all that is expected out of him. He plays the role of a cop with a dark secret of false methodology of conviction with Internal Affairs closing in on him. He ends up killing his partner accidentally but it turns out that his partner was going to help Internal Affairs close in on Pacino. And hence nobody is going to believe that he killed his partner accidentally. And to add to all the trouble, there is Robin Williams' character who knows this secret and is using it to get away. Pacino is the one who is suffering from Insomnia. He is in a country where there is no night and there is no peace in his mind. Have you wondered what it is like to carry a heavy mind craving for the peace of the night? Look at Pacino in this movie! Simply masterpiece acting.There is a short but very effective role by Hillary Swank as well and she does her part beautifully. She plays the role of a cop who is helping Pacino on the case. She also holds deep respect for Dormer (Pacino) since she has spent her training days studying his cases. Overall, the cast was really good. Christopher Nolan chose a very silent approach in this movie. In some parts of the movie, the overall silence creates the sort of haunting effect needed to create the impact. But the silence does not seem to work in certain scenes and may lead viewer to become disinterested.There are times in the movie where the pacing tends to get a little slower causing an occasional loss of interest. But overall, this movie is indeed a very well done movie. The team assembled is indeed a great team. It will not disappoint most viewers who have some expectations from a team like Nolan, Pacino and Williams.",Insomnia
225,bedazzle,How nice: Poetic justice and its problems.,5,25 May 2002,"SPOILERS, interpretation: This movie is a good example of how contrived Hollywood movies can get when they believe poetic justice to be an absolute necessity. With poetic justice, since both Williams and Pacino commit a sin, they must both be punished. Williams must be punished most because his crime was committed with clear intent. So in the end, Williams receives his punishment when he dies. Pacino dies as well, but there is a difference between his death: he repents before he dies. So what was intimated from the beginning is affirmed: though both men work together and both have committed a sin, Williams clearly represents evil while Pacino represents good. With his repentance, Pacino is assured his place in heaven, and William's punishment will continue in his hell-bound afterlife. This is further evinced when Pacino falls asleep because his conscience is now clear. The problem with this, which is nicely explained in Hermann Hesse's Demian' is that a deathbed repentance is quite easy and convenient. Take the biblical story of the repentant thieve for example. Two thieves are crucified with Jesus. One insults Jesus and one repents to Jesus, and is thus granted entrance to heaven. But is it really so virtuous to live a life of sin and then repent when staring death in the eye? The repentance is not authentic, but fear based. Hence, both Williams and the non-repentant thief are the virtuous ones, for truly accepting their life and it's decisions and its consequences. A final scene in which Pacino isn't made to look heroic would have been much preferred, because 1) it's not so very trite and would possibly redeem some of the movie's slow and self-serious plot, and 2) it's more philosophically and religiously coherent.",Insomnia

229,EdYerkeRobins,"Christopher Nolan Goes Chronological, and Almost Gets Another Neo-Classic",7,1 June 2002,"Christopher Nolan's previous two films, ""Following"" and the buzz-starter ""Memento"", have earned him quite the attention.  It seems he's been dubbed one of those rare directors who can put out mainstream films with an artsy/""underground"" feel and appeal, all after only two movies.  His latest, a remake of the 1997 foreign thriller ""Insomnia"", features no lasting gimmick, which, interestingly, detracts from the film, but instead features excellent performances and setting/cinematography to solidify it.The best thing about the film is the great acting performances from the big-name leads.  Robin Williams shows he can be as convincing a disturbing villain as a beloved family hero.  Al Pacino sells the sleepless induced descent to madness of his character brilliantly, but otherwise is just his normal self (which is still good, but it's difficult to see him as the ""beloved good cop"" the script makes his character out to be).  Hilary Swank delivers another top performance with her portrayal of too perky cop Ellie, bored with the small-time crimes only to discover on an exciting case that her idol Al Pacino might not be the man she thought him to be.  The three characters have great chemistry amongst each other, ironically much more chemistry than Pacino with his character's partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan).On that rare occasion when eyes are off the main characters' dynamics, a good look reveals the beautiful cinematography.  The film was shot in Alaska and British Columbia, and the landscapes have a certain lush yet desolate feel that can't be found anywhere else.  It's also interesting because even in a setting with the sun out 24/7, Nolan finds a way to give pivotal scenes an apparent darkness reflecting the tone of the picture.  The never-ending sunlight also adds an eerie quality to scenes with Pacino walking around the town late at night.  With no other individuals around, but bright sunlight, it seems as though the world has ended (which, in a small town like that in the movie, when a high-profile murder occurs, it probably has).With excellent performances and cinematography, the only thing that slightly drags down ""Insomnia"" is its lack of a gimmick.  ""Memento"" was deemed revolutionary because it was cut backwards from end to beginning, which made the audience identify with its confused main character (once you knew what was going on, the movie was simply not as great as it was when you were as perplexed as its lead).  ""Following"" earned similar interest for another non-chronological editing gimmick.  Although parts of ""Insomnia"" do employ visual and audio distortion, these parts are few and far between. While there's nothing wrong with the film, the lack of an expected ""cutting-edge"" (no pun intended) gimmick throughout makes the film ever-so-slightly less interesting, especially as a remake.  It's still a very solid film that's worth watching, but it only has one real nail-biting moment and no real unexpected twists.  It's undoubtedly one of the best films of 2002, but it can't compare to other classic thrillers or even Nolan's own track record.",Insomnia

231,jason_13,Really great thriller with unforgettable acting,6,21 March 2006,"Insomnia might be considered as one of the few commercial thrillers from the past 10 years, but of course that doesn't necessary mean it's not good. In fact, it's really great. I don't quite know what I liked so much, but when I think about it, I really loved it. After the movie ended, I thought it's nothing special, but it's something I would recommend. Well, I guess I have seen some bad thrillers lately and I appreciate what Insomnia showed me.We have a story about a detective investigating a murder among the woods of a small city. Very few citizens and nobody could suspect anything bad could happen. One day, Will Dormer played by Al Pacino, along with his colleagues are in action, trying to catch the killer. The is a fog and Will is completely alone when he sees a man with a gun pointed at him. He shoots him, thinking it's the suspect, but it turns out that it's another one of his colleagues. Nobody finds out about this and Will starts living in fear, keeping that secret. And the most important is that the real killer saw Will killing his friend and now Will could do nothing except waiting, helping the killer in what he needs. His life becomes a nightmare.Well, it's a nice plot. There is a drama element in the movie that you would probably like. It kinda fits with the story, the atmosphere and the location where the movie takes place. Dark, lonely place with a bad mood atmosphere surrounding it. Somehow you could not have a straight thriller or a satire. It just cries for drama. And if we add that Pacino's character has had bad life and he lives in a nightmare, the pessimism takes place and you understand the movie is not what you thought it would be. After the first half an hour, the movie becomes more of a character study then a crime - thriller with great twists and tension. And since I put SPOILERS, I would allow myself to tell you that the killer in fact appears on screen 40-50 minutes before the end. It's kinda Se7en style, but with different plot purposes. This time Walter Finch played by Robbin Williams, is a cheater, a cold blood murderer and kinda eccentric and sly person. At least enough sly and clever to rule Pacino's character. At least I did have expectation for a tensed thriller with a twist, but as I said it became a character study which is kinda provocative and it explains why Insomnia has some haters. I personally liked it. I guess Pacino played his role in a great way, so there was no way I could have been disappointed. And the bottom line is that it actually turns out that I loved the character study factor, cause of Pacino's great performance. I don't see anything wrong with it, but some people do. In this particular case, it depends on what are your expectation before viewing Insomnia.I want to point out that Williams as the killer, was ridiculous. This is a thing I hated. He is not believable at all. His facial is funny even when he tries to be deranged psychopath. Acting is indeed great as I said many times already, but that was one of the worst cast choices ever. Of course we have great Swank performance which for me is the best actress alive these days, we have Pacino with a great performance as the unhappy, pessimistic looking detective and some nice performances by not that know performers. The director Christopher Nolan, perfectly know with Memento, does his job. I just thought that there might be people who are ready to view Insomnia, immediately after they are told it's from Memento's director. Final words - highly recommended fresh and original drama - thriller with different and casual plot moments and superb acting.",Insomnia

But when I saw the movie (2002 version), I was not only reminded of what no sleep is like, but what fun it was watching Al Pacino and Robin Williams become enemies.Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner are assigned to go to Alaska and uncover a mysterious murder of a 17 year old girl. When they arrive in Alaska, they are teamed up with beautiful police officer Ellie (Hilary Swank) and her squad. While trying to solve the case, Will begins to suffer from insomnia because of the summer non stop daylight. It even gets worse because while out hunting a suspect in the fog, Will accidently shoots his partner leaving him dead. Will recieves a call the next day from a mystery novelist (Robin Williams) who claims to be the murderer of the 17 year old girl and who saw Will murder his partner. It turns into nothing but a world of blackmail because the author threatens to turn Will in if there is no cooperation between the two.I honestly think that Christopher Nolan is going to be a success because of his first two movies.

I got the feeling I was watching Seven set in the Alaskan wilderness at the beginning.  I hope the original version of this film is not as cliched as this.

With Insomnia, this follow up of Memento, he returns to the regular structured plots, but stills into his world of insane and maniac situations. We see this poor detective performed by Al Pacino, who has a terrible insomnia for many problems and the damn light of Alaska that never really leaves the movie. In a couple of minutes we have the same feelings. We feel tired, but not because of the movie but because of that overwhelming atmosphere, oppressive and uneasy. Our eyes adapt to the few light spots, so when a sun ray hits our retinas we almost got blind. This kind of feelings are hard to introduce to an audience, but if you are so prodigious and intelligent as Chris Nolan, is a piece of cake.

Plot lines don't come together, even though the story line is pregnant with possibilities. An accidental death--or is it--and the hero is conveniently free of disciplinary charges that would have materialized if his partner lived. Scheming with a killer and almost allowing an innocent person to be framed. These all make for an intriguing drama--yet, for some inexplicable reason, the film comes off somewhat flat.

Some examples of the changes include: the dog Pacino shoots is already dead; Pacino does not feel up high-school girl; Pacino does not have aggressive foreplay; and the ending is awfully moralizing.

Robin Williams, who is always and forever Mork whichever role he plays, does his impersonation of deadpan. Considering that Williams' reputation derives from being hyper, this is something of a joke, albeit in poor taste. Hilary Swank looks very nice, and acts well.

243,mpofarrell,North To Alaska...,8,17 June 2002,"A small commuter plane flies precariously over an eerily foreboding, ice encrusted Alaskan landscape at the beginning of INSOMNIA , director Christopher Nolan's spectacularly picturesque thriller. Its occupants, senior detective Will Dormer [ Al Pacino ] and his younger assistant Hap Eckhart [ Martin Donovan ] have been called to a remote Alaskan hamlet by the local police chief, a former cohort who once worked with them at their base of operations in Los Angeles. Summoned by their friend to help solve the brutal murder of a local high school girl , the invite also serves as a temporary buffer for Dormer, who is the subject of an Internal Affairs investigation.The opening of this picture sets the tone for the entire film ; buffeted by high winds and choppy seas below, the tiny plane cautiously descends amid misty gray clouds pierced by mammoth , spruce covered mountains. Once on land , the plot takes hold of the viewer and never lets go, and leads detective Dormer on a disturbing cat and mouse pursuit that finds the killer all too quickly, but that is really not the main concern of this movie. Once the culprit is found, the ingenious screenplay then reverses things by having the mouse control the cat and ultimately both cat and mouse deceitfully aiding and abetting each other. This is the only way to hint at plot details without giving the movie away; as grim as the proceedings are, this is a hugely entertaining film graced first and foremost by a brilliant performance by Al Pacino as the beleaguered Dormer. Beset by his own demons, Pacino's character is also besotted by lack of sleep, initially provoked by problems back home but aggravated by Alaskan ""white nights"", a phenomenon in northern most areas where summer skies don't darken but take on a late afternoon ambiance.Watching Pacino 's transformation from seasoned professional to a haggard husk of a man is fascinating. The scene at the Inn where Pacino rages on the phone to his testy superior in L.A. is acting of the highest order. Also commendable is Martin Donovan in his small role and Hilary Swank , the remarkable actress from BOYS DON""T CRY, superb as an eager detective assisting Pacino. The wild card in this movie is the appearance of Robin Williams as a writer of middling crime novels, a character so creepy it is jarring to see Williams essay this role, until you realize how fully he inhabits the character. It is a chilling performance. On a technical note, this is one of the most remarkable feats of film editing I've witnessed in years [ the entire section where Pacino pursues a hooded figure from a mountain cottage into the craggy gray mist deserves an Oscar unto itself! ]. Last but not least, the use of the panavision camera makes full use of the stunning locale, thanks to Wally Pfister's painterly camera eye.Panavision's rectangular configuration makes a perfect frame for this film, and Pfister's compositions and color timing immerses you into the picture. This is Christopher Nolan's first film since MEMENTO , an oh-so clever film noir that told its story backward, a neat directorial hat trick but one I found exasperating to sit through. This time he tells a more linear tale and in the process has made a better movie.",Insomnia

A-list cast of Al Pacino & Robin Williams with great supporting cast of Hillary Swank & Martin Donovan. Al Pacino is Al Pacino, no amount of my words could increase the Legend he is. Robin Williams played well the 'charming-looking' killer.The best bits are the recurring themes of Justification of Crime(small or large). All villains has movitations & justification for their actions and they use that to reject 'justice'. Both protagonist-antagonist have done crime with justifications fleshed out through-out the film, their parallel leads to the great confrontational scenes.
Ellie Bur(Hillary) character at the end not falling for the same trap of bad-cop is poetic indeed.Fantastic cinematography of Alaska at the start and great bits of Alaska's tropes(time, refuge) were very well handled and shownChristopher Nolan is my favourite director and I love him because he is the only one in business to make films about 'weird-concepts' and give outstanding executions, his films are hella-original. This movie lacks those (least Nolany film) but these doesn't make this directive-trillers any less great.To tell a personal truth, for the first time in like 10 years I haven't slept the whole day-night, had Insomnia symptoms for a while and now this movie kicked it to full gear.One of the finest,well crafted Directive-trillers with great twists and turns sprinkled around.",Insomnia

While not as avant-garde as Memento or Following, it is still very suspenseful, and it makes the viewer focus on the moment rather than thinking about the sequence of events.What makes this movie interesting is that Dormer (Pacino) knows who his adversary is early on. Finch (Williams) makes Dormer suffer for the rest of the story, sometimes it seemed almost unbearable to see Dormer being tormented.As for the acting, Pacino, Williams, and Swank are well cast and gave remarkable performances. I expected good acting and an excellent story. However, I found the story good and the acting excellent. Will Dormer is one of Al Pacino's more memorable roles, ranking up there with the characters Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, Tony Montana, and Vincent Hanna.This was a movie that I could not rate right after seeing it.

I thought the direction of the film was great and had a well-executed plot.Al Pacino (Will Dormer) did a stellar job as he seemed like a real detective in a tough spot. He also played off the sleep deprivation very well. Robin Williams (Walter Finch) was outstanding, and it was interesting seeing him as the villain. His cool and calm demeanor made his role memorable as it was a change of pace for him. The cat and mouse game between Dormer and Finch was portrayed terrifically. Hilary Swank (Ellie Burr) was great but overshadowed by Pacino and Williams.The Alaskan cinematography was terrific as they showed why Alaska is considered ""the Land of the Midnight Sun."" It added some realism to the plot. I liked how Dormer's final words were ""let me sleep,"" as it summed up the movie and title perfectly.Overall, I'll give Insomnia an 8/10.

Yeah so its a pretty basic who done it type movie besides the whole Alaska thing.But what I love about this movie is the realism that Christopher Nolan is famous for. Even before he was known for Batman his movies had that amazing look Nolan is famous for.  The cinematography is incredible. Its like a travel brochure for Alaska! Its simply amazing. The story is great. It leaves you in suspense wondering whats going on but in a good way. And not to spoil anything but the reason its called INSOMNIA is its filmed in the part of summer where the sun never sets (sort of the same as the movie 30 days of night). It just adds to the films allure.So if you like great crime movies in the ""Who done it"" genre and you haven't seen this flick? Where have you been!?! Its time to track this movie down and watch it. You will be in awe. Especially if you're a fan of Christopher Nolan's other work or like the actors Al Pacino, Hilary Swank or Robin Williams.",Insomnia
249,kingbad,Mesmerizing thriller,8,12 May 2003,"Poor Al Pacino can't sleep. An LA cop stuck in the Alaskan summertime, the sun never sets, and his body can't adjust. What's worse, he's being investigated by Internal Affairs, he's just shot his partner to death, and the killer he's trying to capture knows all about it. Great performances by Pacino (the bags under his eyes are so large, they need their own trailer between takes), Robin Williams as the conniving mystery author-murderer, and Hillary Swank as the young local cop who slowly turns from fawning to suspicious. As Pacino's character becomes more sleep-deprived, he begins to doubt his own senses, and so does the viewer (a trick director Christopher Nolan used with great effectiveness in Memento). Well-written, not too gory, and an interesting twist on the slippery slope a cop faces when he fudges the evidence to catch a criminal.",Insomnia
250,ravenus,More a cure for Insomnia,3,14 December 2002,"SPOILER ALERT The main problem IMO with this film is that it gives off a thorough sense of `under-achievement' in every aspect of it. There were a thousand ways little and big in which the visual and emotional core of the film could have been imbued with substance but really all that seems to have fallen by the wayside if at all considered.1. The look of most of the film is so utterly generic it's disheartening. The aspect of a sparsely populated settlement who live a season of perpetual sunlight is dealt with in a perfunctory manner that sucks away most of the uniqueness of the film. This should have been a focal point that defined the sensibility and emotional core of the film and it was just thrown off as a two-scene gimmick reference. The entire concept of `light-as-darkness' blinding and disorienting Dormer's character is never approached to an extent worth the mention. Without that really what was the point of shooting the film in Alaska - to show that Alaska's cranky teens and crazy killers were like those in any other part of the country?2. Pacino seems to have been selected for the role of the haggard Dormer simply because his entire current career seems veered towards playing haggard old men. This is not to say that he does a bad job, he gets pretty effective in some of the scenes that come immediately after the partner's killing but really at very few points does one feel the turmoil and disorientation of Dormer and there are a few bits of sleepwalk acting even for an insomniac character.3. Robin William's writer-killer character is again a stereotype that has been seen in umpteen movies made before. I really wish they had taken pains over giving his character a different edge - I remember seeing this Iranian movie `Sara' where a man is blackmailing his employer's wife to keep his job. The beauty of it was he did it in a manner that struck you more as a reasonable plead for help than an arm-twisting. An approach like that would have worked wonders in the scenes where Finch negotiates with Dormer. But we're still stuck with the generic loony-killer.4. The clean-cut rookie cop who's a fan of Dormer (Hilary Swank) seems like a throwaway character although one does not fault Swank's performance. The film would have been tighter in the absence of such extraneous parts.5. The film lacks any real sophistication relying on cheap `oooh blood' shots to appear edgy.6. The climax is a total no-brainer. I'm informed that the Norwegian original ends on a morally ambiguous note with the cop getting away with his escapade. Hollywood of course shies away from such subtleties and we're subjected to a pointless gun-battle in the aftermath of which a dying Dormer advises Swank to not `lose her way (towards truth, justice and the American way, one supposes)'",Insomnia

Detective Dormer emotionally and physically was torn down; sleepless nights and confusions did not stop him to ultimately seek justice for this case. Finch is a very complexed character with a dark past and knows how to deal with Dormer; however, Dormer understands it and doesn't give up.

253,AlienByChoice,they don't films like that anymore... or do they?,9,4 October 2002,"You do not often have a feeling that you have just finished reading a fine book, but that's exactly the feeling this movie gives you. The main cast: Al Pacino is as good as ever, and Robin Williams is doing surprisingly well as a villain. However, I don't understand how could the casting directors think that Hilary Swank was a match for the two Hollywood stars. To put things straight, she is not a bad actress, but she is also not good enough to play alongside Pacino and Williams. The script: it's a book. That's the feeling you get. It's not predictable, but you get the feeling of where things are going. You have some dialog and then you have some scenery, and you just know how it could have been described in a novel. The story is very realistic, except for some minor flaws (SPOILER: a detective wouldn't have called to L.A. to tell the wife of his partner about his death. Local police officers would have personally delivered the news.) Camera work: fantastic. Incredible scenery is wisely used to give the viewer the atmosphere of what the place is like. Directing: the whole concept of insomnia is missed somehow. We know Dormer can't sleep, but besides being reminded of it from time to time by his colleagues, we see no effect of it on Dormer himself, except for the last few minutes of the film. We don't see Dormer drink coffee every half an hour to stay awake, we don't see him use eye-drops, even though his eyes are perfectly clear with no signs of red. He sees some back-flashes from time to time, but that's not enough to give us a feeling of a man in a constant need for sleep, which he can not get. The score: nothing original, the score is similar to music you have heard in tens of thrillers before. Conclusion: this film probably deserves an 8, but I am a huge fan of Al Pacino. :-) 9/10",Insomnia
254,scarecrowman,A marvelous film. Christopher Nolan does it again.,9,9 February 2003,"When I saw Insomnia the first time I was a bit disappointed.  I have never been the biggest Hitchcock fan and this film seemed to be a page directly out of the Alfred Hitchcock guide book to film making.  It is not as if I hate Hitchcock I just think his techniques have become over used and cliche. I was really excited about this film before viewing because I am such a fan of Christopher Nolan from his work on Following and Memento.The biggest disappointment however was that the film made me tired.  I caught myself dosing off several times during the film.  Upon repeated viewing I realized that this was the brilliance of the film.  Nolan found a way, perhaps accidentally to make the viewer feel the same way as Al Pacino's character.  This is when it ocurred to me Nolan is still the genius he was two films ago.  The story is great, and the acting superb.  Robin Williams pulls off a great take on a mundane psycho, and Hillary Swank as in Boys Don't Cry helps carry the film.  I recommend this to any Hitchcock fan and if you love suspense films and find yourself disappointed the first time, watch it again and you will love it.",Insomnia
255,dillylamar,Insomnia,10,4 June 2020,"This 2002 film directed by Christopher Nolan is an underrated gem. Its setting, and cinematography feed into its isolation. A film about guilt, right or wrong, action and intent, and moral compromise. This film is edited well, along Christoper Nolan directing into a great way. Pacino gives a standout performance, and so does Robin Willams. Doorman's history of manipulating evidence based off his own personal opinion clouds his consciousness. His then accidental killing of his partner, furthers that, as he struggles with his distinction of action and intent. He then begins to suffer from Insomnia. While Finch claims to also suffer from it, as he proclaims to accidentally killing the girl. Finch witnessed Doorman kill his partner, and so they are forged to ""work together"". And you dont know who to trust. In the end Doorman does the right thing, and dies in the process. He tells Elllie that she can ruin his reputation, as he is released from his Insomnia and can finally sleep This visually stunning and edge of your seat psychological thriller is a gem.

256,Peter Elefant,Not a bad effort (SPOILERS),8,19 November 2002,"I enjoyed Insomnia, because it is a story that is all too ordinary, and then again not. Begins pretty obvious. Two hot shot detectives arrive in small town, trying to solve a murder. One very smart, one very slick.The murder victim is a 17-year old girl. She's been beaten to death, and then, afterwards, washed and cleansed. It seems to be first victim of a serial-killer.Luckily they are pretty clever, these detectives, so they lure the murderer into a ingenious trap, which fails, sadly.But this is where the story takes a turn. One of the detectives (played by Al Pacino) is a little too clever. He's a bad good-guy, which has been a little too clever with the evidence in his early career, and the thing is, that his partner knows about it. And to make things even worse Internal Affairs are hot on his trail, and his partner is pretty sure that he's going to tell everything in order to save his own neck.It's very foggy were the trap is set, and in all of the confusion (And all of the fog), Al Pacino shoots his partner. Maybe intentional. Maybe not.Fact of the matter is, that when he is to give testimony, he tells a(nother) little white lie about how the shooting went down. No reason not to blame the murderer, right? He's a murderer anyway, you see.But the night after, Al Pacinos character can't sleep. He's suffering from insomnia, constantly rethinking the events that led to his partners death.That's when the murderer (Robin William) calls him. Seems the two of them have something in common now. None of them can sleep, and they both seem to have ""accidently"" killed someone.The rest I will leave for you to enjoy as I did. You will see a thriller that could be pretty ordinary, but is saved by a good director, being the magnificent Christopher Nolan. Nolan understands to show - not overdo - subjective storytelling, where we are to understand why it's not a great thing not to sleep for 6 days or so.Al Pacino. Well. He's good old Al. A great character-actor, which I find interesting to watch.Robin Williams acting in this one I am very conflicted about. I didn't find him very scary. He seems a pathetic character, in the way you think of William H. Macys character in Fargo. But then again, maybe that's the whole point? Portraying a man which seems to be ""Just a smart man that made a mistake"". If so, he hasn't enough screentime. Be it Robin Williams performance, or be it lack of twists in the story, I found the ending quite anticlimactic and kinda ordinary. That is why you should view this film as entertaining, not as film-study.
As entertainment it's pretty good, though. 8.",Insomnia
257,easmith03,"Enjoyable, but how about some aluminum foil for the window?",7,23 October 2002,"This is a solid murder mystery, with some great acting performances. Dormer(Pacino), a Los Angles detective comes to Alaska to help out on a murder in Alaska.  He brings a partner, Hap, with him.  In Alaska, a new police officer, Ellie Burr (Swank) is a fan of Dormer's and has studied his work in ""the academy"".  At first the movie seems to be a straight forward ""who doneit"", but a couple of twists spring up.  Dormer and his partner are having a conflict about an on going internal affairs problem back in Los Angles. It is apparent the pair have something to hide. Dormer has trouble sleeping in the land of the midnight sun, and his physical condition worsens through out the movie.  Dormer is clearly a superiour detective, but his problems back in Los Angeles, crept up to affect his police work on this case.  There are some twists in the plot that are clever, and make the movie fun to watch. Although, I had the ending pretty well figured out well in advance.  A few things test believability...** spoilers follow **One being that Finch (Williams) seems to be able to just evade bullets and police, but simply turning and running.  Viola... he is gone.One of the major plot premises, is that Dormer can't sleep, because up in the part of Alaska they are in the sun never sets, so his bedroom always has the sun shining in.  I kept thinking that if I was really in need of a dark room, I could figure out a way to black out the window.  Also, Ellie, the local rookie cop in Alaska, just happened to be a big fan of Dormer's. In fact she did a case study on him at the academy.  I'm not sure I really bought the likely hood of a local cop in Alaska doing case studies on Los Angeles cops.  And then having them show up to solve a crime in your little town.  But, the most significant twist in the plot involves the killer, witnessing Dormer doing something in which Dormer is trying to hide. This is kind of a clever concept, the policeman being blackmailed by the person he is trying to arrest.  But, I didn't really buy the scenerio that got Dormer into trouble.  They have the killer trapped, but he practically disappears into a fog so thick you can't see anything... except the killer apparently can see everything.

The plot is simple but effective and the flow of events quite linear without any loose ends that would in any way challenge the viewer. Murder of a teenage girl in Alaska, LAPD duo despatched to help local police, mistaken shooting and killing of one of the duo by the other, shelf-cover up attempt, emotions of guilt, etc.The acting is good by the protagonists but from my point of view it did not come forth as convincing enough and a touch wooden at times.

It seemed a little too long and not quite as interesting as I had hoped that it would be.The intriguing part of it was the question of  ""crossing the line"" and how justifiable it is.  I think that this aspect could have been better written with a lot more mystery as to Al Pacino's motivations.  Was he really going along with the killer or did he have something more up his sleeve as far as entrapment?Pacino was great as always, he was very subtle, expressing himself with just a smile or a one-liner.

I will have to see the original Insomnia before I can judge what Nolan contributed to this movie because Insomnia was a movie carried by the plot more than anything else.Williams and Pacino were terrific, as usual, and surprisingly Swank was good as the up and coming detective.

He goes through no mad tirades with wild hand gestures and screaming as he is accustomed to doing, so much so he has become a caricature of himself. In this movie, he gets back to acting instead of playing himself. And boy, does he ever deliver.This is a movie about borders; where there are no shades of gray, only the thin border between black and white. When you lose you're way, no matter how slight, there is no going back. Pacino realizes this at the end of the movie.This is not your usual bang em up, shoot em down cop movie, but an intellectual look at vulnerability due to stress and the blurring of lines. Robin Williams is excellent as the wolf in sheep's clothing predator. Pacino is amazing as the wore down big city cop, who meets his match in small town Alaska. The rest of the cast play their roles very effectivally, not deterring any attention away from Pacino or Williams. There are so many subtle lines delivered, so many fragile scenes, it doesn't surprise me it was directed by the man who carefully delivered us Memento.

Nolan's Insomnia is a considerably different movie despite following the plot outline of the original quite closely.  Nolan and his screenwriter add more narrative elements--twists and complications--and provide more backstory, a significant departure from the sparse plot of the European film--that's to be expected from a Hollywood production, I think.  But I was pleasantly surprised to see that Nolan's version keeps intact the moral complexity of the film's main characters--American movies generally exhibit a somewhat Puritanical discomfort with moral ambiguity, but Nolan doesn't seem to submit to that pattern.  All in all, I enjoyed the new Insomnia very much, although I had to force myself to stop being an anti-remake snob and just appreciate it for itself.

It is about a police detective (Pacino) who was sent from the city to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaska town. He accidentally shoots his own partner while trying to apprehend a suspect. Instead of admitting his guilt, the detective is given an unexpected alibi, but this ""solution"" only multiplies the emotional complexity and guilt over his partner's death. Furthermore, there's also a local detective (Swank) who is conducting an investigation of his partner's death... The two main characters are remarkably well-drawn by first-time screenwriter Hillary Seitz and brilliantly personified by Al Pacino and by Robin Williams who is a revelation in what may be one of the best performances of his career. Pacino is even better, portraying his character's experience and determination as a detective while fully embodying the fatigue that'skilling him. He can't seem to get any shut-eye, even after taping his hotel room shades closed in a failed attempt to keep out the midnight sun, so common of Alaska.The only negative comment I can make about the movie is Hillary Swank's performance. She is a lost character swimming in a tide too strong for her, completely left out and erased by the brilliant performances by Al Pacino and Williams.Strongly recommended action thriller. 7/10",Insomnia

Some memorable scenes like the phone call to the widow. This is slow burning Pacino for those who think he just does too much Foghorn Leghorn these days - bellowing and waving his arms. (I'm divided on the subject but admit he can go over the top).Plot outline: The Alaskan sun is pretty much up all the time and Dormer has to deal with a murder investigation/cagey murder suspect while not getting any sleep. To sum it up, this will keep you interested. Christopher Nolan is a talented guy and sets the mood pretty well - shots of chilly landscape constantly lit with light - and keeps the story ticking over. I thought Robin Williams was good in his change of pace role, as a calm and icy suspect and had good chemistry with Pacino. My friend still thought he wasn't dark enough.

The plot doesn't center in finding who the killer is or who is gonna be his next victim, that is pretty much clear when you see the trailer. No, the plot revolves around the cop having his prey in his hands but not being able to turn him in or finish him off.The performances. The oscar-winning trio make the best out of the script. Pacino, Williams and Swank are perfectly cast and give the best performances I've seen this year. Al Pacino and Robin Williams prove that they can do a role far different than what they're used to. Williams has the potential to do a memorable villain. Let's see what he's up to in the years to come.Directing and cinematography. Boy, Christopher Nolan achieves to picture a place where you actually can't sleep. This little town is a dark, creepy place although the sun never sets. Also, through out the movie Nolan depicts quite well that awful feeling you get when you haven't had any sleep.I loved this movie. Please, don't think of it as a ""Seven"" or ""The bone collector"" type of film. It's smarter than that. I tell you this because on my way out of the theater I heard a couple saying ""Ah, I thought it had more action, I almost fell asleep..."". Oh please! You want to see cheap entertainment?

273,Brawl_666,under-appreciated Nolan film....,8,19 December 2009,"Nolan's sophomore effort is unfortunately jinxed as being his most underrated, although arguably his strongest film so far. A detective whose task is to nail a killer finds himself murdering a colleague, because he might have compromised his decisions on past cases to Internal Affairs. The man is conscientious - did he kill him on purpose, or was it a genuine accident ? He cannot decide, but either way he did fire the fatal bullet, and this robs him of his sleep - hence the title. Worst of all, the killer he's looking for saw him do it and is now threatening to compromise him further. So very Shakespearean - Nolan himself calls it ""Hitchcockian"" on the director's commentary. Pfister's camera takes in some gorgeous Vancouver scenery, and Al Pacino hits this one right out of the ballpark. Just watch Pacino during the interrogation scene. There's a beautifully acted moment when he is restraining himself terribly from lunging across the table and strangling the murderer - so much does he hate his guts. Nolan is so intensely focused on the internal drama of the leads, he chooses very simple and direct shots, which are nonetheless elegant. Compare this to David Fincher's Seven, an exquisitely stylized movie that is ultimately about nothing real. Unlike the chilling but wholly unrealistic John Does and Hannibal Lecters of the film world, killers in real life are most often the weakest of human beings - Fincher admitted this with regard to the Zodiac killer - and that is the whole point of Robin Williams' character in Insomnia : a weak, cowardly and very ordinary man who becomes a killer simply by unfortunate accident ; a forlorn middle-ager who dares to imagine himself in love with the first seventeen-year-old girl who gives him some attention, and then kills her when she offends him by literally laughing at his advances.Admittedly Nolan's austere visual style may leave something to be desired for. Occasionally the film feels too talky - too much dialog and character-based exposition, and too little of things actually happening. But these are minor nitpicks.Apparently there weren't enough Batmobiles and explosions to satisfy the popcorn-munching hipster douche bags who also saw this film. Empty thrillers like Seven and The Silence of the Lambs which are thematically hollow and pointless will always garner greater popularity than a deeply psychological film like Insomnia.",Insomnia

The rugged Alaskan scenery is beautiful, and made me want to visit, but, as a crime film, it was a non-starter. The cast is good, but wasted; Al Pacino in both senses of the word, hence the title. Most people going to see a film will know the big name stars who appear in it. When one of them doesn't appear at all in the first half of the film, it's pretty clear what his role in the film is. When he does appear, the obvious is only confirmed, and so there's no ""tension"" left to resolve, and no important questions left unanswered, so I, and I suspect many watchers lost, or would lose interest. It's a shame because Pacino, Hilary Swank, Maura Tierney, plus the ""half-time"" star give good, if not great, performances. Maura Tierney's abilities were wasted, IMHO, with far too little screen time.I can't really recommend this film.",Insomnia
276,deadmanjones,the concept of crime,9,2 September 2006,"Al Pacino, for all his greatness, has ostensibly played two characters for most of his career - mainly the cocksure, occasionally the desperate. Here though, he plays a character who projects both but is neither; for the first time he plays ambiguity, uncertainty and confusion with a subtlety we knew was there but never got much evidence for. His career best performance as the pulp novel cop travelling a Heart of Darkness narrative (with a little bit of Macbeth thrown in for good measure) is equally matched by the direction of Chris Nolan, and by the actor playing the killer (convincingly played lest you should hear different elsewhere). Memento's memory loss mcguffin is here presented as film noir cliché, since Insomnia presents us with the real world; memories of crimes are not the issue, the issue here is the concept of 'crime' itself.",Insomnia
277,arighnachatterjee,A mystic character in a mystique film,8,30 August 2020,A film so mystique! Nolan gives us a pseudo psycho crime thriller experience in insomnia which grasps you hard.

Hilary Swank does add a bit of naive realism to this Northern Lights Morality Play as a bright-eyed young police detective, and it was hard to not laugh at Robin Williams no matter what he does.

280,garydiamond,"Not the best effort of anyone involved, by some distance.",4,3 May 2008,"I refer mostly to esteemed director Christopher Nolan, actors Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank as the most notable here. To be honest I wasn't impressed with any singular aspect in terms of scripting, cinematography, directing, pacing, setting or anything intrinsic to great film-making. Even taken together, I did not find this picture particularly engrossing.Al Pacino's performance is best described as workmanlike. There is none of the showmanship or nuance displayed in Scent Of A Woman, Devil's Advocate, Heat or The Godfather. Bereft of a good script or a chance for one of his trademark speeches, Pacino relies on hangdog expressions as much as Julia Roberts relies on doe-eyed expressions in Notting Hill. From an actor of such obvious ability, this is disappointing. Robin Williams fares no better as the villain. He employs subtlety in a similar manner to his role in One Hour Photo but the effect falls flat here as his character fails to have any depth. There is no reason to hate him, there is no reason to understand him, sympathise with him or be terrified by him. Hilary Swank tries her best with the material but comes up as short as the rest. Martin Donovan is utterly forgettable, even considering the use of flashback scenes and mild hallucinations.The most disappointing aspect has to be the direction. Having seen such fine, genre-defining work from Nolan, it's very sad to see him flounder with this. I didn't necessarily expect clever trickery, complex editing or any of his other hallmarks, but with greater attention to the style and mood of the genre (in this case detective thriller with some film noir undertones) he could have made this much more engrossing. Instead we're lumbered with slow push-in shots, standard alternation between close-up and distance shots for action scenes and pedestrian back/forth shots for one-on-one dialogue. The entire direction fails to create a sense of mood or tension. Even the relative beauty of Alaska is not exploited, or even used except in one short scene where Pacino loses control of his vehicle.There is no sense of progression here. A complete absence of short shocks or built-up set-pieces further desecrates the picture - well, more accurately they are THERE but they're completely ineffectual and usually feel forced. You feel them coming because you've seen them done better in countless other pictures. Al Pacino does not seem any more of an insomniac at the end than he does at the beginning - it's not the make-up, it's the lack of performance. Robin Williams comes in too late and as mentioned, adds no drama or tension.The whole thing plods along without ever taking off. I was waiting for a defining moment, a spark, some kind of twist that would offset some of the obvious weaknesses but it never came. There was never a moment or a line that explained the predicament and gave the film the deeper portent it was aiming for. The plot unravels in ones mind only moments after the credits roll with notable holes and lack of substance.Perhaps I've been spoilt by such great film-making I've become jaded, but considering past performances by the creators I wasn't expecting to be left in such a malady. I am reminded of the recently released 88 Minutes which I happened to see before this picture. Sadly, although that picture is also far from top quality, I happened to find it somewhat more effective.",Insomnia

The cinematography is near perfect. The score is inviting without ever descending to a cloying nature. The script, the story, the twists and turns of the writing are constantly engaging and feed the viewer's attention with scene after scene near perfection.Ms. Swank is wonderful.However, some of the casting is not as good as it could have been. Imagine Insomnia with Pacino and Williams replaced by Smith and Jones, two less prominent actors just as good as all the other elements of the movie and then you are approaching an IMDb rating of around 8. But, with Al and Robin I give it a 6.""Heresy!"", you say. An understandable reaction, given the elevated reputations of the two leads. I mean, the two mean are like cinematic gods, right? No, not really.Ever since 'Scent of a woman' Pacino has been offering the same, overacted character no matter what the project. And Robin? Go watch any interview he has given on a talk show over the last 20 years and you will see what to expect from him, because he can't get out of 'character' either, just like Al.Smith and Jones, two good actors, would have brought interpretations to the roles that would have probably been unique. In fact, I bet their interpretations would have garnered some award buzz. But, in the hands of tired Al and burnt out Robin we get exactly what we should expect from them: two characters that could have been in any other movie.Still pretty good, still watchable at least once. But, this ain't no classic Chris Nolan fans. I guess the good news is that he probably won't make the same mistake again.",Insomnia
284,magic_marker,"Warning, this review will contain spoilers",8,1 September 2002,"One thing that very few film directors, even good ones, seem to understand is that light can be just as frightening and disturbing as dark, if not more so. Bright light creates the same obscuring blanket as dark, depriving you of sight, hiding what should be in plain view, and creating a sense of otherness. Stanley Kubrick employed the disturbing power of light masterfully in ""The Shining,"" the Coen Brothers transformed snow into negative night in ""Fargo,"" Hitchcock used it brilliantly in the ""Psycho"" shower sequence, and now Christopher Nolan, the craftsman who created ""Memento,"" transforms it into a metaphor for the terror of guilt.
Al Pacino plays Detective Dormer, a name that ironically recalls the Latin 'dormio,' sleep. He and his partner Hap Eckhart are sent to Nightmute, Alaska- the place where night does not speak- to unravel the disturbing murder of a local teenager. Dormer is being investigated by Internal Affairs, although the reason why is unclear. Hap has decided to rat him out, and tells him so, because he is afraid of losing his job. Dormer is a legendarily good cop and Hap assumes that IA will not be able to pin anything on him, but Dormer has been a cop a long time and knows that if you try hard enough, you can pin anything on anybody.When they arrive in Nightmute Dormer is exhausted, but he soon learns that summer in Alaska is the time of the White Nights, and the sun does not set. He meets up with a young and inexperienced detective (Swank), and soon realise that the girl's murderer is a psychopath. Upon drawing the killer into the open, Dormer chases him into a fog bank, and, lost in the featureless light, he shoots the first form to come up to him, which, shockingly, is actually his partner Hap. (Hap, which means ""luck"" is another rather ironic name). Realising that IA will convict him of his murder, he decides to cover up the accident, but he figured without the light of Nightmute. Soon, he finds himself unable to sleep, as he desperately searches for ways to block out the light streaming round the edges of his curtain like the searchlight of God. Suddenly he starts getting phone calls from the killer (Williams, excellent), who tells him that he saw him kill his partner. He wants to be let off, and another person found guilty in his place; after all, he never intended to kill the girl, and he is sure the detective will agree that everyone is allowed to make one mistake...
Soon Dormer is a man whose mind, body and soul are screaming. As day after day without sleep pushes him closer and closer to the edge, he must deal with the killer drawing him deeper into his game, acting like his evil muse, while the light streaming through the cracks in his window eats at his conscience. And meanwhile, unexpectedly, the inexperienced detective is beginning to suspect him.""Insomnia"" is an extremely taught and precise thriller, which is to be expected from the man who gave us Memento. It is exceptionally paced and the photography, so important when one of your characters is light itself, is excellent. It's biggest debit, I think, is the performance by Pacino, who, though he does a great job capturing the mannerisms of a man gradually going through nervous collapse, is not very good (Hasn't been for years really) at creating truly sympathetic characters. The audience is unable to look at him and say ""What if that were me?"" something that is necessary in a film about guilt and personal fear. Still, all in all, a very good suspenser",Insomnia
285,shortround8391,"A great psychological thriller, a must-see for Pacino fans",10,15 April 2009,"Since the release of ""Memento"" (which I honestly haven't seen yet) Christopher Nolan has become a rising star in the world of film directing. And he finally shined with both ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" which revitalized the Batman character and established it as the most popular and even putting him above Spider-man. The fact is, Nolan is among the greatest film-makers in the world and he is going to keep making new classics for the years to come, and I'm already looking forward to ""Inception"" in 2010. In 2002, he directed a remake of the Norweigian film of the same name called ""Insomnia"", and I gotta say, it's the best psychological thriller I've ever seen and it even surpasses ""The Silence of the Lambs"" big time.The premise-A highly known and highly accomplished Los Angeles detective named Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is sent to a town in Alaska to solve a murder case involving a 17 year old girl. But his partner Hap, just revealed to him that he's planning on testifying against him because he knows about Dormer planting evidence to gain a conviction on a previous case. And all that guilt, fear and the midnight sun that is constantly shining sends Dormer a whole week of no sleep (insomnia). And Dormer starts to lose his concentration and his reasoning. Al Pacino has been known for dominating every movie he's in and stealing the show from the other actors and he totally does that in here. And it also seems that he was perfectly cast in here because he has the look of a guy who hasn't slept in days. And that might be due to his facial appearance with the dark circles under his eyes and his wrinkled face and he even looks tired the moment he gets off the plane at the beginning. And the more days that pass, he looks more and more fatigued. And I wonder if Pacino really kept himself awake during filming or if he's really that good as a method actor. Although fatigue is the main emotion that he demonstrates here, his feeling of guilt is masterfully shown after he accidentally kills his partner in the thick fog while they're chasing the killer. And we, as the audience wonder if it was really a mistake, or if he shot him on purpose to shut his partner up and prevent his testimony. And Dormer even does some extreme measures to cover up what really happened. At the end, the question is never answered and we're left wondering about his morality and how ethical of a cop he really is. And also the scene when he confronts the victim's boyfriend (whose a smart-mouth, always doing his ""f**k the world act"") and he really shuts him up. I personally thought that was pretty darn cool and he really fits into the mind of Will Dormer and gives one of his finest performances ever.Robin Williams, who plays as the girl's killer, is known for doing comedy roles and he should start listening to everyone's advice and stick to doing dramatic or serious roles, because he is WAY better when he's doing the kind of acting he does in ""Insomnia"". He actually doesn't start showing his face until about half-way through the movie and spends the first half either hiding his face or giving sinister, yet strangely non-threatening phone calls to Dormer. And it turns out that he saw Dormer shoot his partner and spends the rest of the movie blackmailing him and forces him to pin the murder of the girl on someone else. Hilary Swank gives perhaps the 2nd best acting performance and once again, Nolan casted her perfectly as the detective who idolizes Dormer. I guess it has to do something with the way Swank's mannerisms are like. And she's totally believable as the character who looks up to Dormer and she seems like she wants to impress him all the time. And she cuts Dormer some slack even though he gives a vague explanation for an incident involving an officers death. Having a trio of former Oscar winners really helped the film here, and also was the masterful direction of Nolan, he makes the scenery of Alaska somewhat peaceful, yet disturbing. And as all psychological thrillers go...u have to keep the suspense and tension going though the whole move....otherwise, what's the point? At first, you can feel the tension between Dormer and his partner, and then between Dormer and the killer. This is simply the best psycho-thriller I've ever seen, and if you think that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was something, wait 'till you see this!",Insomnia
286,wildstrawbe,Just as bad as the original,2,29 September 2003,"***MILD SPOILER*** I had the chance to see the norwegian version of Insomnia a few years ago and I can't say I was impressed.  Being an insomniac myself I was intrigued to watch this film too especially when I found out that two of my favorite actors were in it (always cool Martin Donovan and Al the man Pacino).I never really understood what all the fuzz about Christopher Nolan is all about.  Following was clever but nothing to write home about and while the trick he used in Memento made the film really popular I thought the film was inferior to Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible"".  What I think Christopher Nolan's films lack is a heart and a meaning and unfortunately Insomnia isn't an exception.The film has a lot of great actors, Pacino is good as usual and both Robin Williams and Hilary Swank play their parts well, but there's still something lacking. Martin Donovan died too soon (sorry for the spoiler) and I think Nolan focused too much on Pacino's guilts for what happened than on his insomnia.

290,Brap-2,The past will come back to punish you.,9,22 May 2002,"(Pre-screen Review from Silvercity Theatres: Yonge And Englington, Toronto, Ontario)As always, a European script makes it to American soil, and makes a moron out of the simple film-maker. Apparently, 'Insomnia' was written by a Norwigean (spelling), and it's flow manipulated this film quite significantly. Plus, having an excellent director behind the camera, and a great staring cast, I would have to say that it all led to a quiet ending.
No complaints about this film - there wasn't much to say, really. All around, 'Insomnia' carries the confusion, lost roads, and numerous side-effects that 'Memento' left with the viewer (as this film was directed by Christopher Nolan, who directed 'Memento'). Also, the cinematography shifted the movie-goer's perspective into an actual insomniac drive. For me, I felt the dread and fatigue that was pushing through Al Pacino's character as the film dragged on. However, it literally did me in, as I started to fall asleep within certain points of the film. Pacino's character was faced with bad karma, as we find out late in the film. He had figured out that covering up the murder of his partner was only making things worse, and turning himself in would have made him feel a whole lot better about things. As for Robin William's character, he made me feel like he was an innocent man at times. His explanation about how he had committed murder seemed almost like it really was an accident. However, a man out of control, like himself, did not deserve to be around others if he were to continue on his life in the way he was planning on living it. Either him, and Pacino could turn themselves in and try to erase their crimes, or, they could face what decisions they had made in the past and continue on.Overall, good film. Hell, it kept me silent for the first five minutes after the credits started falling.",Insomnia

It's too bad that it was one of the most anticlimactic endings I have ever seen.  Despite great performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams, I walked out of the theatre severely disappointed.  It's sad that the final few minutes of the film can ruin an otherwise good movie, but it happened here.  I'm still upset at the terrible ending.  I gave the movie a 7, but only because I'm feeling generous, and 95% of the movie was great.  Still, it's worth seeing.  You may not think so from the review, but that's just me venting.

Definite Hollywood budget, but with at least a bit of an independent/art feel.  Many scenes seemed to be lifted note for note from the original, and I have no problem with that.Pacino already has the look of someone who has been up for days, and he's got the cop thing down to a science.

294,MC ReXX,It's worth the price of admission,8,22 May 2002,"I have to admit right off the bat, that I expected this movie to be given at least an 8.5/10 - 10/10 with 3 top brand actors (Pacnio, Williams & Swank) and a very good director in Nolan after seeing Memento (which was great).After watching Insomnia though, it's proven a point that I should always listen to. ""Just because there are top name actors or directors or producers, doesn't mean the film is gonna be amazing."" And that's exactly what happened here. BUT, (if I paid) it was worth the price of admission (got free passes).The film is set in Alaska, in a small fishing town where everybody knows everbody. A murder of a 17-year old girl is committed and a top LA detective is called in (Pacino) to solve the murder. But the plot takes in interesting twist and the movie takes off there.The pros of this movie: The script was well written and smart. It's not a ""leave your brain at the door movie."" The cinematography is excellent. The direction is very similar to Memento, with very quick flash backs use while a conversation is happening. The acting was fairly good. Pacino, playing the (we've seen it before) don't give a crap detective/cop. Williams, playing a very well, mind-screwing detective author. Swank, who's role was small, but still made the best of it.The Cons of this movie: Williams has a TON of skill and ability as a non-comedic actor, and he doesn't receive enough screen time in my opinion to really shine. If the roles of Williams and Pacino were switched, maybe things could have been a little more interesting. If not, at least the interaction between Pacino and Williams should have been extended or have been able to meet several more times. Where in this movie they only been 2 or 3 times. If the interaction between them where increased, we could have seen acting ability at it's best.Overall, again it would be worth the price of admission. If you liked Memento or Don't Say A Word, you'll like Insomnia.Final Rating: 7.5/10",Insomnia

This movie got great reviews all around the board, and it was pretty much well deserved. It had 3 Academy Award winners (Hilary Swank also, who, by the way, I can't stand) and it was directed by Christopher Nolan (""Memento"").The movie differs from other mysteries because here you know who the killer is - Williams. The story here is about the chase.It was about a good cop with one small blemish on his reputation, and it was being dug up, when he was sent to Alaska with a partner to find Robin Williams, the murderer. Swank is also a cop, from Alaska.Really good movie, more of a psychological suspense thriller, but it did deliver the action. I was doubting it at one point, but then it got really good, and the ending was spectacular. It's pretty much how I would have written to ending, so I liked that.The only complaint I have pretty much (besides the fact that her bag was found near the house...why was her school bag with her on a Friday night after she was drinking?) was that the producers (George Clooney and Steven Sodenbergh) thought that Pacino should've been Spider-Man instead of Tobey MacGuire.

At the point where Pacino is on the way out, and Swank goes to toss the shell casing in the river and he stops her - this was the point where the film pulled into focus. Pacino's words ""Don't lose your way"" - any sentimental nonsense contrived at this point would have ruined Insomnia completely, but he says the one sentence that makes you realise - this isn't a film about Robin Williams at all; it's about cops who - through all the exposure to violence and all the other filth that humanity has to offer - become jaded. The insomnia is really just a metaphor for that, and his question of whether taking the law into your own hands is right or not is answered by his final statement.Pacino excels in this role, and his crafting of this tired, weary individual is unquestionable. Robin Williams is also excellent. Indeed, everyone involved appears to have done such a good job that I'll leave it there.

The protagonist's inability to sleep is a masterstroke as it adds an intriguing element to the screenplay and makes for some memorable scenes. Set at a pace that is unusual for crime thrillers, Insomnia rides on brilliant direction, strong performances and visual rapture to elevate an unremarkable story to a very fine movie. Worth a watch!",Insomnia
303,elwinter,"Complex, thoughtful crime drama set in the land of the midnight sun",8,20 October 2002,"Set in Alaska, this film makes good use of the delirium caused by the midnight sun, using it in a ""Telltale Heart""-esque context.  The cast is outstanding, with Al Pacino as the cast's pater familia, Hillary Swank as an eager rookie cop, Robin Williams turning in a disconcertingly creepy performance as a bad guy, and interesting supporting players including Maura Tierney and Jonathan Jackson (be on the look out for good things from this up-and-coming young actor).  I recommend seeing it on the DVD. Christopher Nolan, Insomnia's director and the imagination behind Memento, twists time in the commentary track.  The film is presented in the order shot, rather than in the order of the script or finished film.  This is an approach I wouldn't mind seeing in more commentaries.  Very thought provoking!",Insomnia
304,uscoa,"Long, yet interesting (contains vague, possible spoilers)",7,31 May 2002,"If I seem a tad nit-picky, it's because I was immediately drawn into this stylish thriller; director Christopher Nolan's follow-up to ""Memento"". Within a half-hour, I had ""Insomnia"" pegged as an ethereal tale of guilt and vengeance set in ""the land of the midnight sun"" (I'd already begun to write my review). With three Oscar-winning performers carrying the story forward, I figured that I was in for a treat. I was wrong. Al Pacino was at his best. With all the intensity he had in ""Heat"" coupled with the passive, haunted aura his Michael Corleone. The film survived by his grace only. When we drifted from the psychological portrait of Pacino's character that had been building up for the entire film to the conventional get-the-bad-guy mode, the film becomes ""Hawaii 5-O"" Alaskan-style. The mind-toying feeling of ""Memento"" tried to squeeze into ""Insomnia"" via exceptional editing and inventive camerawork with an inspired setting, but it doesn't stick around. Around the 1 1/2 hour mark, the plot gets ludicrous, the lines get screwy, and, in general, the film goes downhill. By the time the end came, I felt how the sleep-deprived Pacino looked: weary and waiting for the end. One climax fell after another and I lost interest. The suspense was still there, but the thrill was gone, and by the time the credits rolled I was disappointed by the poor excuse for an ending. As for the two other stars, Hilary Swank and Robin Williams, they never quite fit in. Swank seemed like the woman showing she can do everything the boys can (her character is compared to Nancy Drew) and it serves only to have her be the stereotypical damsel-in-distress. Williams is good, completely cast against type, but good. 7/10 Stars.Quick recommendation: see ""Manhunter"", it's not as stylish, but it's definitely better.",Insomnia
305,war_cat2,He must have been duct-taped,2,11 July 2002,"Going from Memento to this one can only wonder if Christopher Nolan did in fact have anything to do with this film.  The girl I went with fell asleep several times (which brought new meaning to the film's title). I almost fell asleep twice.  The acting is very good, it's just the damn movie moves along so slow.  It's like 'Ok, we got your point, it takes her a while to drive out to the cabin'.... 'do you have to draw it out into a 10 min scene?'. Keep in mind to all you Nolan fans.  He remade this movie from a movie that came out several years ago in france.  So he took a bad egg to begin with. He still shoulda known better. Tisk tisk.  Hopefully he just caught a momentary case of McTiernan virus (McTiernan went from DieHard to Rollerball 2002) and he'll recover.Let's all send our best wishes to Nolan on a speedy recovery.",Insomnia
306,Vladimir_Grozescu,"No brawling fistfights here, just pensive dialog",10,1 June 2002,"Although I love this film and rate it ten out of ten, I do admit that there's something missing, and I can't quite put my finger on exactly what that ""something"" is.  However, I think that if anything was added to compensate for that missing ""something"" the eerie subtly of everything would be trampled.I think a large part of Insomnia's effectiveness has as much to do with David Julyan's film score as it does with Pacino and Williams' wonderful performances.  Sure, the entire movie is ""bleak"" and gloomy (and the score sure adds to it), but what do you expect from a movie with a plot that revolves the murder of a young girl?  You sure as heck don't walk into the theater expecting some feel-good, heartwarming piece of crap that you'd see any other time of the year, that's for sure. We need more movies like Chris Nolan's Insomnia; it's unrelenting yet delicate, and I think that's what's putting people off.  What many want are macho brawling fistfights between Williams and Pacino, but what they get are pensive and thought-provoking dialogue (plus a little shootout near the end.)  Personally, I'm glad we get to see Williams and Pacino talk things out most of the time instead of beating the crap out of eachother in every scene.  They'd be wasting their talent if there was no dialog interaction between the two.My rating: ten out of ten",Insomnia
307,Squirrel-5,The original was better. *MINOR SPOILERS*,4,8 June 2002,"The original version of the film, made in Norway, was far better than this version. The original was easy for Norway to do, Much of the country is north of the Arctic circle with larger towns there (It was filmed in Tromsø, the worlds most populated town north of the Arctic Circle) but for an American film, the only place in the US to do a film would be Alaska where the areas north of the Arctic circle are sparsely populated.The choice of actors was also poor. Honestly, can we see Robin Williams, a comic actor playing the role of a killer? Not me. The American version was too ""Hollywoodized"". Al Pacino tries to make it look good, but I strongly recommend the original. I was lucky enough to have first seen the original almost 2 years ago. I have seen it several times since. Comparing it to the new one. I think they tried to copy the original too meticulously.
*BEGIN SPOILER*Some scenes in both versions were virtually identical. Dormer/Engström taping the window shades down in a futile attempt to stop the midnight sunlight from keeping him awake. Dormer/Engström vomiting in guilt in an alley after accidently killing his partner, the killer escaping through a tunnel underneath the shed.Some scenes were slightly changed to seem more action oriented and less suspenseful. In the scene by the shed, the original had the killer alerted to the presence of the police by the sound a thermos breaking. In the new version, we see a thermos but the killer is alerted due to a policeman's megaphone accidently being turned on.*END SPOILER*I give the effort a plus, but the end result is a poor remake of an excellent Norwegian film.",Insomnia

The lead actor, Skellan Shaasgard, is as good as they come, outshining Al Pacino, and the direction is better.  Nolan is talented but he doesn't do anything here exceptional.  Hilary Seitz is wasted in a nothing role, and the screenplay here basically follows the original, although manages to busy things up a bit needlessly.  Tech credits are solid, of course.",Insomnia
309,Charbax,This movie gives me nausea,5,4 June 2002,"Al Pacino, Robin Williams.. They do it only for the money. They don't care if they force millions of people to spend an hour and a half watching a piece of movie not worthy of ones time.If you like bad taste movies that somehow try to make people think they are original, using shaking cameras, brownish out-of-focus and even more shaking camera... Cut-scenes of blood dropping, people getting strangled.. you know, if you like the kind of video that makes you vomit... Then watch Insomnia, watch Memento, watch Spy Games.Some scenes, for example when Al Pacino kills Robin Williams, it makes you really want to vomit, it is a scene of unbearable shaking camera and lots of very short cuts put together. Throughout this whole movie, you are shown a series of bad camera angles, zoom-in on Al Pacino's rinkels, zoom-in on the profile of Robing Williams and the whole thing is shaking, fuzzy, not sharp, full of mud and ugly.Not to mention the bad story, the bad script. It's really sad and so unbelievably badly written. (spoiler ahead) you want to know what Al Pacino's last words are before he dies? ""Don't lose your faith"", do you want to hear another quote that this movie wants you to think is cool? ""A good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing, and a bad cop can't sleep because his conscience won't let him"". Same quotes we can hear in about a dozen other bad Hollywood movies. Good cop, bad cop, shaking camera, damn I don't care!!Unlike what some other bad comment in here said about this movie, about David Lynch being the same kind of ""Garbage"", I off-course totally disagree.
So you can have an idea of what kind of movies I like, among some other movie-makers I like David Lynch movies, Roman Polanski movies and Martin Scorses.",Insomnia
310,M&J,Great Acting - Average Plot.,8,14 July 2002,"Evidently this film is a Remake. I didn't know it. And I'm betting that the director of this film, Christopher Nolan (Memento), is banking that most Americans are like me; oblivious to the history of the film.Memento was a very original film which won over the critics, but unfortunately didn't fair well with mainstream America at the box office. Memento found its audience on pay per view and as a video and DVD. It is now a cult classic with educated movie fans and film students. There are a lot of folks who now WISH they would have seen the flick on the big screen. Hind sight you know.I mention all this because Christopher Nolan is a smart man, who probably wants a long movie career. Very few directors experience the level of critical success on what was only their second major movie ever. So here is Nolan, on the crossroads. He's won the minds of Americans (the critics, cultural elite, etc) now he has to win over the hearts of Americans. How, by making a relatively safe film that is accessible to most Americans.What's more ""American"" than Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and serial killers? Not much.Insomnia is a good film. But it's a safe and predictable film. It's also a very commercial film, unlike Nolan's previous 2 creations. He's proven to the studios that he can make art, now he has proved that he can make money.It's your standard cops and robbers flick, but what makes the film stand out are the actors. Who would have thought that Robin Williams would succeed in his role as a very convincing killer?  He did a very good job which is almost worth the ticket price alone. And Al Pacino... man, they made him look 20 pounds too heavy and 30 years older--on purpose. He's supposed to be ragged looking and they do a great job. You can sum up the film as great actors, do great jobs in an average script. They did so well, that it saves the film. Anyone else, and this film would have fallen flat on its face because only the acting, and not the directing, kept it afloat.It's a slow film, not an action flick. But it is suspenseful. It gets a 8 out of 10 from me.",Insomnia
311,mjanky,"Good, but could've been great.",7,15 August 2002,"Let me begin by saying I enjoyed Insomnia, and I recommend seeing it. The story, the twists, the camera work, the sound, the direction is all top notch, but what hurts the movie is bad casting and mediocre acting. Except for Al Pacino. I think we take our great actors for granted sometimes. Like here, Al Pacino gives a great performance, but he always gives a great performance, and I think we just expect it. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast (except for Paul Dooley as the police chief) phone in their performances. It's not that Robin Williams, Hillary Swank and Maura Tierney's performances are bad, it's just that they're mediocre and it detracts from an otherwise very interesting story. Part of this problem stems from the characters themselves as written, because they are very formulaic and un-interesting. Even Robin Williams as the killer is pretty boring, which is something I thought I would ever say about him. Let's face it, the killer always makes or breaks this style of film, ala Silence of The Lambs. So if we as an audience don't despise the 'bad guy' it's difficult to get emotional about the movie, and Williams doesn't do much here to have the audience hate him. His character is more like a fly that keeps buzzing around your face that you want to swat away. I won't go into the plot of the movie because a lot of the comments here have already done that, but as I said earlier I think the plot and side-stories here are very interesting and Christopher Nolan, the director, does a great job of conveying through the camera, what it must be like to have insomnia. The photography and scenes of the Alaskan landscapes are some of the best I've ever seen. The score was also very well done. I believe we have a lot to look forward to from Mr. Nolan in the future. Based on the story, the technical aspects, the direction and Al Pacino's performance I rate Insomnia 8 out of 10, only because IMDB doesn't allow me to vote 7.5.",Insomnia
312,beau geste 38,Good cops sleep,9,31 December 2005,"I hadn't read anything about this movie, and just decided to watch it because there was nothing else on T.V. and of course Pacino was in it. If you are reading this before any other reviews, then don't read any further. Get the Video or DVD and watch it late at night, with the phone switched off. If you are still reading, I would merely prompt you to really take in what is happening. This isn't a detective solves a murder film. This is much more. I thought that the title was a bit off-putting. But having watched it, I do understand why it is called Insomnia. Pacino, in my opinion has never been better. My only change would have been to swap roles for Swank and Tierney, but then again I'm a big big Tierney fan. I'm not a buff, so hadn't heard of Nolan, but I shall be looking out for his earlier stuff, and checking on what he is making.",Insomnia
313,o_lopez,similar yet different,7,30 November 2002,"there are many similarities and differences between the norwegian and the american version. i prefer the norwegian because the main character gets away with it. despite the movie's independent movie feel, it has many conventional hollywoodisms. pacino's character goes above the law, but not to the point of foreplaying with an underage minor in a car. skargaard(?) is a person one would have liked to have the same fate as pacino but that's what's good about the original version. the cinematography of the first version is way better as well. that's the only thing i don't like about remakes: they're so similar and yet so different.",Insomnia
314,Masoo,Al Can't Sleep,8,19 October 2002,"Insomnia shows us what Touch of Evil might have been like if Orson Welles' character wasn't such a bad guy after all. Al Pacino is perfectly cast as a guy who can't sleep; Al has pretty much looked exhausted since sometime back in the early 90s, so you could argue he's tailor-made for the title role in this picture. Longtime viewers of Pacino movies know there's two ways he can go with a role, the subtle way or the over-the-top way. Thankfully, in Insomnia he's underplaying, and it works wonderfully. His ever-so-sleepy face does most of the acting for him; like Benito Santiago's, it's a face that tells a hundred tales before he even opens his mouth. Apparently following Pacino's lead, co-star Robin Williams also tones down the outrageous mugging. His face, too, does the work, his entire character seemingly explained by the way his long nose and chin struggle to meet each other somewhere in the vicinity of the mouth. Hilary Swank's role was clearly intended, at least initially, to be the ""we better stick a gurl in this movie, too"" character, but then, surprisingly, she does a lot with the part, no distracting ""romance"" takes place, and the movie is the better for her participation in it. I haven't seen the original film, so I can't compare this remake in that regard, but I can say I found this a more satisfying film than director Christopher Nolan's earlier Memento. I give it an 8 on a scale of 10.",Insomnia
315,D.C.-2,Amazing Film,9,29 May 2002,"Saw this film the other day and enjoyed every minute of it. The three lead performances are fabulous. Al Pacino carries the film with his Oscar worthy performance as a detective suffering from a lot more than lack of sleep. Robin Williams is equally effective as Finch. Like Pacino, Williams restrains himself and by doing so turns in a brilliant nuanced performance. And Hilary Swank takes a role that may seem like it has no ""meat"" and turns it into something special to watch. The rest of the cast do great work as well in small supporting roles most notably Maura Tierney and Jonathan Jackson. The direction by Chris Nolan was well paced and utterly engaging and the cinematography was simply breathtaking. Insomnia should get some Oscar nods especially for Best Actor (Pacino) and Cinematography. I'd give it a 9 since I wanted to see a bit more of Swank and Tierney's characters fleshed out even more. Still it's the best psychological thriller I've seen in a long time.",Insomnia

Not that any of them were particularly likeable to begin with but that is just the easy way out, isn't it?I suppose that's supposed to signify that justice was served in the end, and everyone gets what they deserve?Robin Williams and Al Pacino are both brilliant and convincing actors, although Robin Williams stole the show. He just has that presence. They both still could not save what is a pretty average plot.This is neither the best nor worst movie I have seen, it's quite an unsophisticated and mediocre narrative with outstanding actors and a stunning scenery in my opinion.

319,superjxiv,"Same old, same old",6,1 May 2002,"Someone forgot to warn seasoned detective Al Pacino that the sun never sets in most parts of Alaska at that time of year, and as result, the poor guy doesn't sleep a wink during the entire movie. The poor audience has to endure director Christpher Nolan's hyper-style version of the effect sleeplessness has on the most attention sensitive of minds.That's right, Pacino is the cop of cops in this boring and a sadly typical cop movie. But its not the buddy-cop version, that would be too much just one month after ""Showtime!."" Instead of a mismatched partner, Pacino has one he genuinely likes as a person, which means he won't live that long, and he doesn't. Insomnia's twist is Pacino shoots him, and lies about it.See, the two of them are called from LA (where all good cops come from . . . or . . . wait . . . ) when a seventeen year old is brutally murdered and naturally, the local police are baffled because no one ever kills anyone in Alaska. While on a stakeout, Pacino runs after the killer (an effectively creepy and all too convincing Robin Williams) through fog that appears out of no where thats so thick poor Al can't see three feet, and the second he sees anything moving, BAM! Direct Hit! And wouldn't you know the luck? Robin Williams sees everything.And if you had just beaten a high school to death AND starred Bi-Centennial Man, you'd try to get away with it, too. So he blackmails Pacino, convincing him to help pin the murder on the girl's boyfriend; most of those silly Alaskan cops think he did it anyway. And Williams is incredibly effective as the soft-spoken and rational Walter Finch, who writes novels when he's not killing people or seducing jailbait. He's always calm, and he knows Pacino too well, probably because he writes about cliche detective work that Pacino is given to work with.But there are nice touches. The first few scenes show blood falling on a cuff, and someone vigorously trying to remove those tiny spots. Throughout the film we're treated to super-duper close-ups of that blood soaking into the fabic and staining it; as are those same stains on our characters and consciences when we've comprosmised morality. My gripe with ""Insomnia"" is that here we have ANOTHER cop movie about cop morals (Los Angelas cop morals, to boot!) and the line between right and wrong.Don't other people in our great and diverse society question their morals who AREN'T cops and attorneys?

326,pvilleguy,well done thriller,6,20 September 2007,"This little suspense piece was pretty well done in two primary respects. First, Robin Williams again proves that he is better served playing dramatic roles than comedic ones. He's too busy trying to bring Mork from Ork to all his comedic roles. His dramatic performances are more disciplined and much more effective. The second was the tidy use of the metaphor of Detective Dormer's inability to sleep in the perpetual daylight of northern Alaska in the summertime. He becomes obsessed with keeping the light out of his room just as he was obsessed with keeping the light off of his improper behavior in LA. The parallelism between the quest to keep the light out of his room and to keep the dark chapter of his police career from being illuminated is at the same time subtle and obvious -- a very nice piece of film-making. Al Pacino is restrained and vulnerable as Detective Dormer, which is a nice departure from his more typical roles. This is not his best work, but he's still very, very good. Hilary Swank is convincing in her role as the eager and attentive Detective Burr. All that said, this story dragged along at times. I was never convinced that homicide detectives from LA would be dispatched to assist a small town Alaska police force in resolving a relatively run-of-the-mill homicide, especially when the detectives dispatched were deeply enough involved in an internal affairs investigation to be front page news. Three stellar performances (Pacino, Williams and Swank) and some beautiful scenery boost this film out of some slow-paced story telling.",Insomnia

I think he was best filmmaker in the past decade, and if he continues making highly innovative,different,engrossing and intense films like memento,Batman Begins,TDK and now Inception, he's going to have a claim to be one of the greatest directors of all time. He's certainly on his way there. This film is by no means lacking in creativity, but when you look at Nolan's other works, this is no doubt the odd one out, there is genre subversion with the classic dark noir scenes replaced by omnipresent sunlight. The plot is good,but not great. What really draws you in is Al Pacino showing his greatness as an actor with a brilliant rendition of William Dommer,the title character .A cat-and-mouse game between hero-cop-with- skeletons-in-his-closet-suffering-from-insomnia-and-guilt and criminal- with-ace-up-his-sleeve is intriguing and engaging. But so,Robin William's appearance somehow hurts the movie, who,despite his talent,gives an unusually lackluster performance. The movie then loses its pace and intensity,and I found my attention wandering,something I thought impossible during a Nolan Movie. The 24-day concept is new and refreshing,Hillary Swank also gives a solid performance. The first 1 hour was very promising.Yet, somewhere in between, the movie loses its intensity, and already lacking Nolan's characteristic incredibly out-of-the-box-theme, it also loses its chance at greatness. Despite that,it's not a bad movie by any stretch. It's definitely worth a watch.

While people who don't enjoy the Nolan brand of cinema will mark Insomnia as their favorite from Nolan. Simply because, this movie is a remake and while has many of Nolan's signature styles, it is not as evident as it is in his other superior works (IMHO).Nolan's movies (from Following to Inception) is built around the concept of duality. Insomnia has a similar theme running through it, that of Al Pacino's character living the life of a honest role-model while still doing things reprehensible, thus showing two sides of life. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are in supreme form and the cinematography by Wally Pfister is gorgeous. But the 'quickness' that is associated with other Nolan movies (even BB) is visibly absent in this one. It is by no means a bad movie, but the slow burn of the thriller does dampen the effect. Not a must watch, but an intriguing thriller that well matches its Swedish inspiration.",Insomnia
331,theedcarol,Acting was great; story was mediocre,7,26 May 2002,"If actors make a movie then those bankrolling this film should be thanking the stars, both the celestial and the human varieties. Oh, the story was OK and fairly predictable. I even found myself trying to guess the unexpected twists that never materialized. But Pacino showed why he is still one of the finest actors around today. His portrayal of someone suffering from sleep deprivation was so real that we couldn't understand why it wasn't more recognizable to those acting with him. Robin Williams was able to overcome his typecasting and was perfectly believable as a calculating villain. Hillary Swank did an excellent job of morphing her character as the plot developed. There were a couple of scenes where one had to willingly suppress disbelief, such as when Pacino spent about a minute trapped below surface in frigid waters after a vigorous pursuit sequence. Then there was the fog that mysteriously thickened at the worst possible moment. The conclusion of the film was plausible but not completely satisfying. I would have liked more twists throughout. But the acting was wonderful and made the move a ""must see.""",Insomnia

And for those of you who are afraid to watch because you've seen the original, I promise you will not be disappointed.The screenwriter made appropriate changes to the script that really improved the film.  The dialogue could have been simplistic, but instead was natural and sophisticated.  Most invited were the addition of several unpredictable plot twists as well as an improved ending.Pacino, Williams, and Swank all deliver incredible performances.  Pacino especially, who portrays the conflicted detective so perfectly.  The cinematography only enhances the emotion of the performance by allowing you inside his head, which compliments the nature of the film.Not only a crime mystery, but a psychologically-charged drama, this film is a must see.",Insomnia
336,joeydean61869,Insomnia is a fantastic murder mystery...but an even better character study,8,12 September 2007,"***1/2 out of **** starsDetective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) is already exhausted when he flies into Nightmute, an Alaskan hamlet that never loses its sun. An Internal Affairs investigation back in Los Angeles may destroy his career. He has played war with ethics for many years, and he's stressed and bitter because of it. His partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) wants to ""cut a deal"" with IA. The reason? He doesn't want to jeopardize his family's future. Dormer doesn't like Eckhart's decision, obviously. We get the impression their partnership has been strained for some time. To say the least, there are many things weighing heavily on Dormer...it gets worse.Why are they in Nightmute? There was a murder of a teenage girl. Dormer and Eckhart are there to head the investigation. The local detectives regularly follow up on bar brawls and domestic disturbances, but a murder probe is a bit too ambitious for them. Nightmute's Detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) sees Dormer as an idol and a legend. She's motivated, new and untainted. She likens the investigation to something she can happily learn from, like a school project, and what a splendid mentor she has in Dormer!...if she only knew.So who's the killer? It's a novelist named Walter Finch (Robin Williams) who had befriended the teen at one of his book signings. She shamed him, and he murdered her...but there's more. Dormer shoots and kills Eckhart (accedentally?) while chasing Finch through the dense fog. Dormer instantaneously pins the shooting on Finch, but there's one problem: Finch saw him do it. So now, Dormer's caught in a Catch 22: if he captures Finch he captures himself.What's great about this film is Pacino's ability to make us like Dormer through all his deceit. We feel sorry for him because he knows how far he has crossed the line and he hates himself for it. Finch is another story. He views his horrible crime as an accident that could happen to anybody. Pacino, the great method actor, and Williams, the erratic improviser, complement each other wonderfully because they play characters that are polar-opposite.Director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) loves the use of close-ups and flashbacks. Often we see a flashback of Dormer scrubbing blood off his shirt from another immoral probe; a metaphor of his desire to become clean of dishonor. There are flashes of the murdered girl giggling at her mentor: the innocent and prudish incitement of bloodshed. There are many close-ups of Pacino wrinkled, haggard and exhausted. Nolan obviously felt it necessary to physically exploit the mania in Dormer's mind and soul. This is Shakespearean in tactic: the physical manifestation of inner torment.Two scenes from Insomnia are particularly memorable for me. One is when Dormer is driving the victim's best girlfriend to the site where the body was found: a trash dump. Some shocking coquetry takes place, which makes us wonder how shameless the detective really is. In the end, though, he only wishes to teach her a needed lesson in humility, and we're relieved. The other scene is of Dormer driving alone on the wet, Alaskan highway. Awake for days, his overworked, debilitated mind makes him think an 18-wheeler is about to crash into him. He slams on the brakes only to find nothing is there. Nolan pulls this scene off with great, awaking intensity. The vast, overhead shots of the vehicle and the close-ups of the interior windshield are brilliant.Swank's performance is a tad more than one-dimensional, but I believe her role was written for that purpose. She's a very talented actor who has played characters with much more depth and scope (Boys Don't Cry, Million Dollar Baby). Here, she simply embodies what Dormer perhaps once was many, many moons ago: a young, gung-ho detective wearing a halo of integrity.I'll keep looking out for more work from Nolan. He has proved, so far, to be something of an auteur. Insomnia is his finest film to date. The casting of Pacino and Williams doesn't hurt things either, especially when the roles are so right for them.",Insomnia

Al Pacino is brilliant as an insomniac on the edge (he's come under investigation in L.A.  so WHY would they send a cop under a cloud all the way to Alaska?  Does L.A. routinely export its dirty cops?).  He really does make you think he hasn't slept since he made it to the Land of the Midnight Sun.Robin Williams does well in a relatively minor role as the author-boyfriend- suspect putting Pacino to the test (but his character seems to know an awful lot about Pacino's past; where does THAT  knowledge come from, and why does he know that Pacino is even in town to investigate this murder?).  Hilary Swank is good as a novice Alaskan cop not taken seriously by her co-workers (how many cops DOES it take to run this little Alaskan town with so little crime?), but she has some hokey moments, including a real clunky one with Pacino at the very end of the movie.This film was directed by the same guy who did `Memento' (Christoper Nolan), but don't expect the same genre of quirkiness.

Williams' character is highly intelligent and way beyond the intellectual level of the locals investigating the murder. To be honest, this is quite disappointing to Williams' character, as he wants someone to know just how brilliant he is. Pacino provides WIlliams with that one intellectual equal that will be impressed with the fellow genius. However, Pacino's character is dealing with a life spiraling down the toilet and is far from impressed with the regaling of how somebody murdered a teenager. In one of the greatest pieces of dialog ever, Pacino (Dormer), confronts Williams (Finch) with the following, as FInch eagerly awaits some sort of accolades:""You don't get it do you, Finch? You're my job. You're what I'm paid to do. You're about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a fucking plumber. Reasons for doing what you did?

Actually I found this version to an okay time-filler; but nothing more. The Norwegian original this was based on would have to be considered far superior. We've probably seen Al Pacino in the detective role too many times, and Robin Williams, while good, enters the plot much too late.Now onto the ""meat"" of the plot (if you'll pardon the expression): the dead dog scene. In the Norwegian original, the detective shoots a LIVE dog to fake the ballistic evidence; this is both an emotionally jarring scene and serves to further alienate the detective from the sympathy of the audience. In this version, Christopher Nolan chooses to plan it safe and have Al Pacino (conveniently) come upon a dead dog, and later return to the corpse to shoot it, then dig the slug out of it's carcass. While not packing the same wallop, this scene IS well done by Nolan and very grisly in it's own right -- we not only see the dog's death-snarl and sightless eye, but we cannot fail to recognize the gruesome fact that digging around in a rotting dog corpse has got to be pretty darn gross!

Hap, however, is convinced that they have been sent away to ease the pressure of a sweeping Internal Affairs investigation underway in L.A.Dormer closes in quickly on the primary suspect, mystery novelist Walter Finch (Williams).  Fortunately for Finch, however, he has some valuable leverage on Dormer; he knows something that Dormer can't afford for anyone else to find out.  As a result, Finch, who believes that his experience as a writer qualifies him to be a master criminal, is able to manipulate Dormer and the local cops.Compounding Will's problem with Finch is the midnight sun of Alaska; Dormer hasn't been able to sleep since he arrived.  As Dormer's grip on reality becomes increasingly tenuous, he is beset on all sides by his personal demons, by the devious Finch and by an earnest rookie police officer, Ellie Burr (Swank), concerned about the direction her own investigation is taking.Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort since his critically acclaimed Memento is significantly less confusing and much more rewarding.  The Oscar-encrusted cast deserves quite a bit of the credit.  Pacino is Pacino, but he works perfectly as the shady, shoddy veteran cop and he manages not to chew up all the scenery.  Robin Williams is surprisingly creepy as Finch, and he manages not to erupt into madcap hysterics.",Insomnia

But, how do you follow-up something like Memento?  Obviously a brilliant effort.  Insomnia, not so.  A puzzling effort.  The biggest puzzle of the summer.  It has flashes of brilliance but the final package just has no intensity about it.  Anxious yes.  Thought-provoking only enough to make the premise interesting, nothing more.  Intense no.  The establishing of the narrative's dynamic is handled with great care and expertise by Nolan.  Both Al Pacino and Robin Williams render fine performances.  Pacino will surely get a Best Actor nomination (and perhaps win compared with the other performances I've seen so far this year.)  The cinematography was very well executed.  The film captures Detective Dormer's increasing isolation, desperation, the effects of sleeplessness on his thinking and professional drive, his inability to shut out light (his sense of guilt), the emerging doubt about his true motivations as he sinks ever deeper into a morass of lies in order to pursue a truth all these elements were superbly handled.  And yet, in the end, the flashes of brilliance don't add up to anything special.  The ambiguity, Nolan's trademark, works well on a moral and simple plot level but what is the context?  Unlike in Following and Memento, there is ambiguity without genuine context in Insomnia.  Ultimately, despite the well-told story, it fails to live up to its potential.  Still, the elements were well enough developed and directed to justify labeling Insomnia as Nolan's `graduation piece.'  He has made the transition from art house to mainstream director. It will be interesting to see where he goes from here.  I'd give it an 8. Despite its flaws, Insomnia is one of the best offerings we've seen this mediocre summer.",Insomnia

Al Pacino is to investigate the murder and gets caught by sleeplessness because of some reasons. Basic idea in the story is not bad.

355,NonnaYobidness,A good movie but who wrote that lousy ending?,8,1 June 2002,"Make no mistake, Insomnia is a pretty good movie. It has a good story and a nice pace. Al Pacino, of course, is one of the greatest actors of all time and can always be counted on for an enjoyable performance. Just as pleasing is Robin Williams who absolutely holds his own opposite Pacino. I have always liked Robin Williams as a comedian and his more recent roles in movies such as Good Will Hunting, What Dreams May Come and Bicentennial Man are quickly establishing him as a talented dramatic actor, as well. One of the things that made this movie a treat was the great chemistry between Williams's Walter Finch and Pacino's Will Dormer. Both characters are utterly believable in their roles and they play off one another quite well.The other performances range from passable to quite good. Hillary Swank gave a decent performance as Ellie Burr, a stars-in-her-eyes admirer of Pacino's character and Jonathan Jackson gave a surprisingly good if somewhat under-written performance as Randy Stetz.The main plot is entertaining and interesting and is helped along by the ""did Will Dormer murder his partner"" sub-plot.No movie is perfect and Insomnia has its flaws. One is the use of the ""spinning moving camera"" that seems to be gaining popularity in modern film. I have a strong suspicion that this is used to avoid having to pay people to choreograph the action scenes. The camera gets right in on where the action is happening and then moves around wildly while the characters on screen grunt and jump about. Very annoying. If you want a fight or a foot chase, please let us see what is going on. Fortunately, Insomnia makes sparing use of this technique but it is present. Also, the film spends a little too much time convincing us of how tired Dormer is. The show him tossing and turning in bed, hallucinating and sweating but it isn't very believable. He has supposedly been awake for six days straight but the only real effect on his actions is that he goes around looking sleepy all the time.** Warning: Minor spoiler(s) ahead **Sadly, the single worst thing about this movie is the ending. It's as if the producers decided at the last minute to fire the writing staff and hire a graduate from the Hollywood School of Schmaltzy and Nonsensical Endings. Ellie is supposed to visit the bad guy (who she does not know is the bad guy) to pick up some letters from the deceased girl. So far so good. However, when she gets there, the bad guy clocks her on her dome and drags her to the back room. Where he leaves her. Alone. And not very well secured.This entire plot development is lame and unnecessary. the protagonist (Pacino) already has PLENTY of motivation to go back to the killer's cabin and this twist does nothing to further the story. The bad guy has spent an entire movie craftily manipulating the police and casting suspicion on someone else. The police have totally bought it and have the person they think is guilty under lock and key at the jail. The bad guy is in the clear, so what does he do? He attacks a cop who everyone in the entire police department know has gone to see him. The excuse for this idiotic behavior? She saw the dead girl's dress in his cabin. However, the only reason she saw the dress was because the bad guy opened the drawer right in front of her and then left it open while he wandered around the room.I like the movie, so I didn't go out of my way to make that last bit sound too bad, but it is. However, it pales in comparison to the weak and contemptible way in which this movie's writers resolve all the sub-plots and issues revolving around Al Pacino's character. They spend a whole movie building intrigue around Will Dormer; his past cases, his problems with Internal Affairs and whether or not he murdered his partner. Then, in the last two minutes of the movie they dispose of all those problems in the most pathetically convenient way imaginable. I cannot begin to tell you how unsatisfying the ending of this movie is. It almost ruins an otherwise very enjoyable film.All in all, I am not sad that I spent time and money to see this film, but I am almost angry at the filmmakers for the disrespect they show for the viewer in the film's resolution.6/10 because of the lame last five minutes of the movie. 8/10 if the ending doesn't bother you.",Insomnia
356,shecrab,"Almost, but not quite",7,27 May 2002,"The film Insomnia, based on an earlier Norwegian film, is an almost winner.By acclaimed directed Christopher Nolan, (Memento,) this is a bet that almost, but not quite, pays off, in the sense of waiting for the ""other shoe to drop."" It is not so much a murder mystery as it is a character study, but, as with the rest of the film, it's almost but not quite that, also.Al Pacino is Detective Will Dormer, who has been summoned to Nightmute, Alaska by an old friend to help solve the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Pacino is a man on the verge of many things: retirement, age, and moral collapse, as we learn early on. He and his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are being investigated by Internal Affairs back in Los Angeles. On the way to Alaska, Hap informs Dormer that he intends to ""cut a deal"" and take whatever comes of it. This doesn't please Dormer in the slightest, and he gives the impression he'll fight the investigation, and his partner's selling-out, but fate has a different idea. Early in the investigation, Dormer accidentally shoots Hap. With his partner now dead, Dormer has nothing more to fear from IA. Or so he imagines.Enter Walter Finch, played by Robin Williams; he is the main suspect in the murder, and has also seen the shooting of Hap, or so he informs Dormer. Now the plot will weave around these two, almost exclusively, as they play their game of manipulation and one-upmanship. And here's where the film begins to lose its own compass.First, I had a bit of a problem with the fact that the two detectives from L.A. were in Alaska to begin with. Supposedly, this is an official trip, but I have trouble believing that the Los Angeles Police Dept would send two of its people to Alaska for such a mundane reason. Yes, it's murder, but the ease with which these two solve the case and pinpoint the murderer is just so fast that it's hard to believe the Alaskans couldn't have done the same, and done it sooner. Second, the character of Ellie Burr, (Hilary Swank) who has made a study of Detective Dormer's work for her academy thesis, is just a little too worshipful. And what a coincidence that she should be there in Nightmute, involved in this case. It's a little too contrived, in my opinion. Hilary Swank, a wonderful actress, is overqualified for the wide-eyed wonderment she portrays here. There's not enough depth in her character to hold your interest.Third, we never really get a chance to pick apart Finch, Robin Williams' character. We only know a little about him, but nothing essential, and nothing that adds to our understanding of why he committed this foul deed in the first place, or what is driving him to do what he does. We come into this situation, ""in the middle"" and leave it pretty much the same way when the movie ends. There's a solution, but no enlightenment.
There are two other interesting characters that also tease us into wanting to know more, but never give up any information beyond that: the hotel desk clerk, played by Maura Tierney, and Police Chief Nyback, played by Paul Dooley, are both characters I would have liked to see developed into ""whole"" people. Especially Tierney's character, who says one of the most fascinating lines in the film, something about how people in Alaska are either born there or are there because they've escaped something a lot worse. With a lead-in like that, it was a shame not to follow up on it.Mostly, we are treated (?) to extreme closeups of Pacino as he spirals down into his insomniac, ethical black-hole, and teasers of the menace Robin Williams might actually be hiding underneath that parka. In neither case is it enough, or satisfying, and as the film winds down into its inevitable conclusion, we are left with a hollow feeling that we just didn't get enough. We can draw conclusions, but they are not the point; the point is what makes these things happen in the first place, and that's a question that goes unanswered. Additionally, there are some recurring cut-scenes of the murder itself, which are never explained or illuminated. They appear as memory flashes, but we never see them in their entirety, which is extremely annoying. Overall, the film looked as if it were originally a lot longer, and was edited down to fit its current time. If that's not the case, then it's just too minimalist to make a satisfying story. The plot is, or could be, a very good one, with a bit more explanation. There is a lot of atmospheric buildup, but in the end, not much suspense or tension for the viewer. The characters tease us with development, never quite making us understand them, or their motives; they feel thinly painted, and shadowy. Not a tour-de-force for director Nolan, though Pacino and Williams give their parts all the nuances they can.I left wanting more.",Insomnia
357,mpdmartin,Gripping crime drama,9,7 January 2016,"Reviewed by Martin Davis, Retrospect Film on Facebook. Having directed the critically acclaimed and commercially successful 'Memento' and before his hugely impressive relaunching of the Batman franchise, Christopher Nolan directed this tense and gripping crime drama. A remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, 'Insomnia' sees world weary LAPD detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) assigned to investigate the murder of a teenage girl in a small Alaskan town. Early in the film we learn Dormer and Eckhart are themselves under investigation by Internal Affairs. Much to Dormers frustration, Eckhart confesses he has agreed to an immunity deal if he testifies against one of his partners past cases. With tensions running high between the two, a trap is laid for the girls killer. When Dormer accidentally shoots and kills his colleague as they stake out and then give chase to their suspect in the Alaskan fog the only witness is the suspect himself. Dormer knows whilst he is under investigation the accidental killing of his colleague will come under scrutiny and blames the escaped suspect. The scene is set for a riveting game of cat and mouse between the detective and the, as yet, unknown killer. Over the next few days Dormer is unable to sleep due to the guilt of shooting Eckhart and the perpetual Alaskan daylight. Growing increasingly paranoid and hallucinating, he then starts to receive anonymous phone calls from the man he is searching for. Dormer eventually finds him, an author living in a nearby town named Walter Finch, played in fine understated form by the late Robin Williams. There is to be no straightforward arrest though. Both men harbour terrible secrets about each other. Meanwhile, an ambitious young local cop, Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) is starting to put the pieces together about the killing in the fog and to realise all is not as it seems. The net is starting to close in on both the hunted and the hunter. Much less your standard cop hunts killer crime film and more an enthralling psychological drama 'Insomnia', amongst others, confirms Nolan as one of the best modern filmmakers. With excellent performances by Pacino, Williams and Swank and cinematography that captures perfectly the bleak Alaskan landscape 'Insomnia' is not to be missed.

358,a-kos,"Good Twist on Film Noir, but View the Scandinavian Original.",7,14 June 2002,"As one of the few viewers who's seen the the original Scandinavian film, I'd like to offer a comparative perspective.  I won't summarize the story because that's been done countless times on this forum already.  Instead I'd like to convince other viewers to compare it with the Scandinavian original.First the good:  The production in this newer version is a significant improvement over the original.  Since the original had a lower budget, it didn't feature many dramatic technical devices.  Consequently, even though the story is excellent, the deliberate pace and relatively stark production make it sometimes feel dry and placid.  The dramatic elements (eerie music, camera effects, etc.) of the remake make the story more compelling.In terms of the story itself, the remake takes compromises that make it less believable than the original.  I'll discuss the details later, but it's interesting to compare a few of the details with the original.  The compromises made in the re-make were probably done to make it more palatable to American audiences.Overall, both films are very good and worth seeing, but I'd like encourage people to view the Scandinavian original.  Comparing both films, it's also interesting to see how these cinematic differences might also relate to cultural differences.  I'll discuss the details below, so if you haven't seen either film, I advise you to stop reading now.Warning: SPOILERS below.There are two specific scenes that are distinctly different when comparing the original with the remake.  Firstly, the scene where the detective (Skarrsgaard in the original, Paccino in the remake) shoots the dog as part of a plot to conceal his mistake.  In the original, the detective finds a live stray dog, then shoots it.  In the remake, the detective shoots a dead animal he just happened to find earlier in the story.  The Scandinavian film is more realistic because it's much more likely he would need to seek an animal to shoot rather than just happen upon a dead one.  While this scene might be more palatable in the remake, it compromises believability for sentiment (as is often the case in American cinema).Secondly, in the original conclusion, the detective (Skaarsgaard) survives, while in the remake he is killed.  In terms of emotional substance, the original is superior because the character is forced to ""live-with"" what he did.  In the remake, the character more or less redeems himself and dies tragically.  While this makes for a more dramatic conclusion, it's also more artificial.  Again, believability is compromised for a more satisfying, but artificial conclusion.I encourage viewers to see both films and compare.  Overall, I think both films are more or less equally good, but in different ways.  The fact that the the original is less sentimental and more realistic might be indicative of some of the differences between Scandinavian and American cultures.",Insomnia
359,kryp44,"Nice drama, not a thriller...",7,31 May 2002,"If you are going to see this movie expecting another nice little suspense yarn like Memento, you may be disappointed. However, you will enjoy Al Pacino's tour de force performance as an embattled LA cop, and Robin Williams does a nice turn playing against type as a creepy Humbert Humbert victimizing an Alaskan Lolita. There is very little suspense but Pacino should certainly garner some early Best Actor nominations.",Insomnia
360,KatieBug19,Lost Sleep,9,2 June 2002,"Although thrillers often affect me far more deeply than they do others, I decided there was no way I could miss this film.  ""Memento"" was, in my opinion, the best film I saw last year, and I am still upset that I missed it in theaters.  So last night, off I went.Twelve hours later, I still haven't slept.  I thought this film was spectacular.  From the opening credits (after nearly twenty minutes of previews and commercials) to the closing shot, this film was brilliantly conceived and executed.  I thought, for starters, that it was amazingly tight.  At pretty much exactly two hours, Nolan knew what we could and could not handle.  The editing was the other element that just blew me away.  The intercut shots were often terrifying and mood altering.  Just when I would start to relax (due in large part to the hibernation-inducing temperature of the movie theater and not the film), I would be jolted by an image that reminded me how important, fragile and scary this film is.The acting was also fabulous!!!!  I do not think I have ever enjoyed Pacino so much (except for in ""The Godfather"" and ""Godfather II""), but Robin Williams was the one who really left my mouth open.  One review I read accused (or praised) him of being the first actor since the release of ""Silence of the Lambs"" who was not imitating Anthony Hopkins, including Anthony Hopkins.  I could not agree more.  He is effective because of the nuances: a look, a gesture, a nervous laugh.  If he always played villains, he could not be this effectives.  The reversal is what shook me and kept me up all night.  Ms. Swank's youthful idealism also worked for me, and I think it would have been more universally acclaimed if she had been given more time to develop her character.I think the most important note about the acting is that none of these characters is sympathetic.  These aren't villains and heroes, good guys or bad guys, no matter how much we want them to be.  Just like the grey fog that blankets everything in the film, these are grey people caught in a situation in which they have ... but what is it that they have?  Agency? Responsibility?  Choice?  Your answer to this question colors (pun intended) your response to the film.  Much discussion, literal and figurative, takes place about ""truth"" vs. Truth and black/white vs. grey.  In many ways, this was the heart of the film just as it was in ""Memento.""  The coolest part about ""Memento"" I thought was the way Nolan manipulated our tendency to gravitate towards certain characters because of cinematic conventions and assumptions.  I thought the same was definitely true about ""Insomnia,"" except this time we were left in limbo rather than realizing we had been wrong the entire time.  The scariest part of ""Insomnia"" is realizing you can't compensate, you can't correct for this.  No matter what and who you choose, you are wrong in some way.I also enjoyed seeing the emerging motifs Nolan uses: scenes with characters looking in mirrors, unlikely locations for chase scenes, dark vs. light cinematography, blending the typical and the extreme, and an intuitive sense of time.  I would say that these are used in a less abstract, more accessible way, but the other user comments I read lead me to believe that perhaps the status ""Memento"" already had when people saw it influenced their opinions and reactions.  So perhaps the best advice I can give is see this film with an open mind.  But isn't that always true?It is important, however, to realize that this film has more in common with ""Double Indemnity,"" ""Touch of Evil"" and Alfred Hitchcock than with the typical ""thriller"" of today.  The body count is considerably lower, and if you enter the theater demanding extreme violence, definitive answers and a sense of closure because of the genre of the film, you will not be satisfied.  Perhaps Nolan's message has to do with the idea that he is going make the film he wants to make, tell the story he wants to tell and undermine our position/power in any way he can.  I, at least, think this is a fabulous thing!Verdict: 9/10 (But who am I to judge?)",Insomnia

Thank You.BTW I release this is remake of a 1997 film, this does not negate the merits of Nolans vision of Erik Skjoldbjaerg's original.

Okay the story is simple; someone has killed a girl in a little town in Alaska. You know pretty soon who has done it, but in this film that is not important. What is important in this movie i hear you asking. Well that is the information the detective and the killer give each other. the detective (Al Pacino) has insomnia, because it doesn't turn dark in that place in alaska. So he is paranoia?I really enjoyed this movie, and i can recommended to everyone who has enough of the simple thrillers and want something new.greetings from gijsI like to now your opinion about this movie so if you dare e-mail me at g_dijkman@hotmail.com",Insomnia
363,Hammy-5,Intelligent Thriller,8,30 October 2002,"Christopher Nolan happens to be the guy who wrote and directed one of the most fresh and innovative thrillers of recent times, namely Memento'. So I get to watch his new offering that stars Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Sounds good to me.Never having seen the original Norwegian film, I cannot say how many changes have been made to accommodate the change of location, Hollywood actors and the American & English speaking audience. What I can say is that I thought it was very clever. It hooks you early on and drags you along at a heady pace. The characters are well drawn and within minutes I had a connection with Dormer to the point that when he has his discussion with Eckhart (Martin Donovan) I was shocked and dismayed that such a nice guy, and obviously good, conscientious policeman, has stepped over the line. This continued on through the film to the point where we find out what he has done. It is a very intriguing plotline. There are a number of questions that I, as a viewer, was asking through the course of the movie and all were answered in the end.Do I really have to say anything about the acting? Al Pacino is always convincing. The man also has a presence that makes him the focus of any scene. Watch a Master at work. He plays the insomnia of the title so well that as the climax comes into view you want to give him a good slapping to wake him up. Robin Williams often has his performances talked down. May be this due to some kind of snobbery over the Mork', stand up period of his career. I have usually found his straight' performances to utterly believable and compelling, and I would say the same about the quiet and subdued portrayal given in Insomnia'. That said I would also say that there isn't a bad performance from any of the cast. Most don't have that much to get their teeth into but they do their best with what they have.Memento' was a totally new way of filming a thriller..or even any movie. If you haven't seen it I suggest you do. Nolan cannot be expected to carry this off every time. Here we have some lovely filming of locations, as you would expect with the story being set in Alaska. I did find the almost subliminal shoots of flashbacks and hallucinations a little intrusive, but then again also liked the intelligence of the director showing us plot pointers and the effects of lack of sleep. So on the whole I suppose I give them the thumbs up. For a wordy piece and thought it had a good pace and I never felt that scenes were drawn out or overly long.Not Memento' but still a very good, intelligent thriller from a good Director and featuring a couple of wonderful performances from two very good actors. See this film.",Insomnia
364,rsillima,Superb ensemble piece,10,16 November 2002,"What makes Insomnia work is that it understands its limits, treats them as strengths, and plays to them. The 3 primary leads are all superb in their roles & it really is an actor's movie. The director leaves just enough loose ends floating around to create the feel of reality, rather than the packaged Hollywood product.",Insomnia
365,vorhese76,Very well done and engrossing,9,4 June 2002,"MINOR SPOILERS: I went into this movie expecting a lot, luckily I got back what I wanted. Nolan did absolutely fabulous on Memento and his indie film Following. So I was excited to see him tackle a big budget movie. This was pretty much an Al Pacino movie the whole way through. I've never seen a more haggard looking Pacino. He definitely seems like a cop who's lost his way and is just trudging through life. Hilary Swank was very good as the young Alaskan cop. I'm glad she didn't try to play the role too gung ho, but still had a strong female lead. And Robin Williams surprised me playing the murderer trying to find his wild card.The film was beautiful. Some of the arial scenes over the Alaskan environment had me ooing and ahing. At points I was expecting Lovecraft's Mountains Of Madness (set in Antartica) to begin. The scene with the logs in the river had me holding my breath right along with Pacino.Very well done, perfect resolution at the end, don't miss.",Insomnia

367,rafecomo,Perfect metaphors and photography to the movie's meaning,9,4 May 2014,"This Nolan film may seem kind of ""easy"" compared to his others if you watch it very vaguely, however it is perfectly written and shown that it can be one of his best.The film's main theme is guilt and escaping from it, and through all the movie we can see that every single thing and detail is trying to give us that clue:First of all, Al Pacino's character can't sleep because being asleep would be the only way to avoid his guilt and be in peace, but since he carries the fear of his previous cases and the A.I. Investigation he can't find that peace to rest.Second, the fact that is never dark on the town and the sunlight is always up again reaffirms that the truth is always out and there's no place there to hide from it, a possible reason why Pacino's character always tries to make his room darker, so he can find a place to hide from the light, the truth.And third, the only reason why he shot his friend on the fog was because it was the only place where he could do it and get away with it, since it was never dark in town and he couldn't sleep, the fog seems like the perfect environment to let his real feelings and desires out and shoot his partner, the only place where he could hide; whether it was conscious or unconscious who knows, but he definitely wanted his friend dead.So this film is a true masterpiece, and every single detail of it may reveal more to it's true meaning.",Insomnia
368,AtlasWolf,Stunning,8,19 January 2019,"There's a lot to be said about an actor that can start a movie as a character and by the end of the film he's playing someone entirely different and the audience never caught the subtle changes. Al Pacino nailed this role.Easily some of Robin Williams best acting as well. That coupled with Christopher Nolan's imagery and soundtrack. I rewatched this move about six time in two weeks. One of Nolan's hidden gems, that is arguably one of his greatest films.",Insomnia
369,Orri-4,Great story told in a less great way (possible spoilers),7,30 May 2002,"The story is excellent, but somehow the fast editing (Mtv style is not appropriate for this quiet Alaskan town) and all those extreme hand held close ups managed to alienate me again and again. It was particularly annoying in the beginning, when information about the crime was given, to have all these silly split second flash backs (or just flashes) pop up on the screen.  Because of this the movie never got to that stage when I forgot about the camera and editing and followed the story. Sometimes it was obvious that some of the dialogue had been cut, it sounded like a commercial: no pauses between sentences. There were however good moments there, especially the lumber scene, the fog scene and the scenes with Dormer in Finch's apartment. Also the scene with the girl at the hotel when she talks about two kinds of people moving to Alaska. Hillary Swank did a great job as the blue flaming police officer; modest and clever. Pacino somehow was the same as always (Any Given Sunday for example) and Williams was OK.The ghost of Dormer was extremely well done as well as the logic of the whole story. The scene near the end when all the information had to be given to Burr was a bit awkward, but worked. The bottom line: great story, but not so great direction/editing. The credit goes to the writers, Nicolaj and Eric.",Insomnia

Al Pacino performs very well; the role of the cop simply fits him , yet INSOMNIA is probably not the movie he will be remembered for later. However, I had some difficulties watching Robin Williams as the bad guy, he always gave me the feeling like there is a slight smile on his face. This might happen if you have watched too many comedies with him before. The story is good, just the ending is rather poor, but watch yourself.

371,08131352022,A very good movie with only one little flaw ...,9,10 February 2003,"On the whole Insomnia is a very well done movie. I enjoyed the story, the way it is told and how it develops. The dialogs are kept short. There are a lot of memorable quotes. The cast is very well chosen. Al Pacino is brilliant in his way as always. I also want to mention the performance of Hilary Swank. She is very convincing in her role. Robin Williams also gives a great performance (though I enjoyed his performance in 'Good Will Hunting' more). There is only one scene in this movie which isn't quite so convincing. It's how Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) obtains that .38 bullet. First, you can't muffle the blast of a .38 gun shot with just a towel. The only result would have been black holes in the towel. Second, a .38 bullet fired from that distance would have gone right through the body of such a small decaying dog. No way to recover that bullet with such a tiny pocket knife. Someone who doesn't know about shooting and firearms might not be bothered by this, but I would prefer that scene to be done differently. A dead deer or elk by the road might have been a better option. Nonetheless it is a very good movie and worth having on DVD, because it is worth watching more than once for all its nice details. My rating is 9/10.",Insomnia
372,trendell-1,Once is not enough!,9,9 June 2002,"Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"" is so good, so full of intriguing detail, that I found it even more enjoyable on second viewing than on the first. The direction is first-rate, and the acting, especially Pacino's, is generally better than good. The really good news about ""Insomnia"" is that it's at least as good as, and arguably better than, the original film on which it's based. This isn't always the case when Hollywood re-makes a ""foreign-language"" film for the big screen and the big names.
There are several good reasons for the artistic success of ""Insomnia"" (2002). First, is the choice of Christopher Nolan as director. The man really does know how to use his camera and his actors: clearly, his ""Memento"" of two years ago was no flash-in-the-pan success. Another reason for the film's success is that the screenplay was written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, who also wrote the 1997 Norwegian original. (Skjoldbjærg also directed the original.) I can only speculate on their feelings about having the opportunity to re-do their own fine film, to expand on the original concept, take it to a new setting, broaden the characters, and fill in some of the blanks in the story.
Although the two versions of ""Insomnia"" are different in many ways, the basic plot outline is the same. A young woman is murdered, her body cleaned of all useful forensic evidence - except that the very cleaning is evidence of a kind - and left on a rubbish heap. A famous police detective is brought in from the south to assist the ""locals"" in solving the crime: from Los Angeles to Alaska in the current film; from Sweden to northern Norway in the original. In both cases, the locale is in the far north, in the summer, when the sun never sets. The southerner finds the continuous daylight disorientating, with night turned into day, and his sleep patterns are disrupted - hence the film's title.In the course of the investigation, during a stake-out gone wrong, the famous detective shoots and kills his partner, and then attempts to pin the killing on the young woman's murderer, through manipulation of the physical evidence. In each case, the rest of the film is an exploration of the detective's sense of guilt, his bizarre relationship with the murderer, who has witnessed the shooting, and his increasing instability from lack of sleep.The back-stories of the two films are very different. Detective Will Dormer (Pacino) arrives in Alaska with a lot more baggage than can be carried by hand. He's fabricated evidence in a gruesome abduction/murder case, and he's under investigation by Internal Affairs. His partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) is about to cut a deal with I.A. to protect his own career. This provides the necessary tension between the two men to make the apparently accidental shooting suspect, not only in the viewer's mind, but also in Dormer's. In the original film, detective Jonas Engström (Stellan Skarsgård) also has a blot on his record, but there appears to be no I.A. investigation (or whatever the Swedish equivalent might be), and thus no real tension between the two detectives, beyond the fact that detective Erik Vik (Sverre Anker Ousdal), a much older man, is a bit of a plodder, cut from smoother cloth than Engström.The principal supporting role, that of the local female detective is also very different in the two films. In the current version, detective Ellie Burr (Swank) almost fawns over Dormer, and that characterisation creaked a little for me. Burr declares she has read all of Dormer's cases (how likely is that, really, since it appears that Dormer has been an L.A. detective for about 30 years?), and made a detailed study of one of his major cases during her stint at ""the academy"". In the original film, detective Hilde Hagen (Gisken Armand) is a seasoned, tough professional, who suffers no burden of hero-worship. For me that characterisation worked better. Happily, Swank's character grows as the film develops.I have mixed feelings about Robin Williams's role, possibly because it's a new take for him. (Which is all to the good: some of Williams's sentimental past performances require dangerously high doses of Gravol to sit through.) I thought that his character had rather too much to say for a demented killer, and in some scenes he was, as the English would say, ""too clever by half"". Overall, I would give his performance one-and-three-quarters thumbs up. I will say, however, that I liked the original - Bjørn Floberg  as the killer/writer Jon Holt - better. His characterisation had an edge, and a dangerous quality, that the Williams character lacked.One cannot say too much about Al Pacino's performance as Will Dormer. One review I read declared that the essence of the film is written on Pacino's rugged and wasted countenance. And that's true enough, but the greatest quality of his performance is in his eyes, in the depths of pain lodged in remembrance, the aspect of a decent man who has seen so much that he has, in his own last words, ""lost his way"". It's a brilliant turn. Pacino works the part for every nuance that it has, and then some.Skarsgård's take on detective Jonas Engström lacks the bravura quality of Pacino's Dormer. His character is less dramatic, more mundane, and the script gives the actor fewer opportunities for the ""big scene"". We never learn enough about him to have much reason to develop sympathy for his situation. The role is a great challenge, therefore, and Skarsgård does very well with it.Final note. ""Insomnia"" is beautifully filmed, the scenery rugged and spectacular. Those viewers who waited for the final credits to roll by will have discovered that the film, with the exception of the aerial footage of the ice fields at the start, was shot not in Alaska but in northern British Columbia.

374,blaisepascal,Slow but good.,8,28 May 2002,"Insomnia is a movie that puts very heavy importance on pacing. It builds and builds, very slowly, but methodically and intelligently. It's a deep movie that needs an avid watcher. If you are short on attention or feel like watching something that will come out and grab you, I don't reccomend Insomnia. I think you really have to want to watch this film for it to suck you in.Sometimes this movie just got a little too thick and slow for it's own good. I realized towards the end, when the one cop tells a vulgar joke, that that scene is probably the only light hearted moment of the entire movie. And even then it's weighed down by Swank's character, who has a lot on her mind at the time. Certainly this is a very serious, heavy movie, and it should be, but a little break to clear the viewer's mind now and then would have done wonders.Great acting all around, good directing and good script make this movie a 8 out of 10. It also gets kudos for being up there with Fight Club as the best portrayals of having insomnia in a film. (Insomnia shows the condition pretty dead on, and is less obvious about it than Fight Club)",Insomnia
375,gorflax,Good Film,8,17 June 2002,"Insomnia is an interesting film.  The plot is not extremely original, but I don't think the plot was what Christopher Nolan wants his audience to focus on.  The most interesting thing about this film was the motivations of characters and how they interact with each other.  Al Pacino gives a superb performance as a tired insomniac detective and Robin William's character is a perfect counter to him.  Robin William's character also gives a wonderful performance that shows his versatility as an actor.  The shots and picture in this film are fantastic and are starkly different from Nolan's earlier film Memento.  Insomnia is a good film to see for any person who likes mysteries, thrillers or psychological films.  I give it 3 and half stars out of 4.  Excellent film.",Insomnia

Just breaking down the film into its plot and direction, there's nothing much about the movie that brings me to feel the tension or feel any compassion for the characters.  Sure the cop had to cover his a**, and robin was just being the regular bad guy we've seen so many times. The main three characters did not even have any chemistry between them, which didn't really make me care what happened to any of them.
This movie is worth watching for movie-goers alike.  Key tip, always keep your expectations low.  Chris could do better, not completely original this time though.",Insomnia

Pacino put in a veteran performance although some of the fast running scenes were rather obviously a stunt double.  It was difficult to work out whether Williams strayed much from his standard serious role method and as a result, I had no emotional attachment to either of the male characters by the end of the film.  Swank looked great but I felt that she could have been directed somewhat better:  her lines were fine, her acting was fine, but there was something missing in the way that she was being filmed, almost stealing any depth that Swank was trying to put into the character.  There were many cliches used in the film, two of which were pivotal to the plot.    This was very uncomplicated and each scene was obviously and deliberately filmed for their single point:  nothing more.Overall, one relatively original idea stretched into a mediocre tale of few thrills. 5/10.",Insomnia
379,mishory,With Nolan and Pacino you can't go wrong,8,29 September 2002,"I went to see this movie for two reasons: Al Pacino and Christopher Nolan. Let's just say I'll bet on every movie either of these two participate in, and this is no exception.Without spoiling too much, Al Pacino's character is having trouble sleeping all through the movie, for more than one reason. His behaviour gets more and more confused and unfocused as the sleep deprevation takes effect. Pacino's acting in this movie, directed superbly by Nolan, is his best ever, in my opinion, which is a good enough reason to go see this movie.The photography in this movie seems to focus on extreme long shots of the Alaskan landscape and on close ups of the characters, to show that there is little in between in that environment. The editing, however, plays a much larger role in telling the story, specifically sharing the main character's state of mind with the viewer to complement the intense acting. Therefore, as the tagline says, try not to even blink throughout this movie.If anyone is expecting another masterpiece like Memento, this isn't it. But still, for Pacino's acting and Nolan's marvelous direction, I give it 8/10.Enjoy! =8-)",Insomnia
380,Soltes25,Nolan can now be considered one of the best!,8,24 May 2002,"INSOMNIA is not only the third film of acclaimed director Christopher Nolan (his first two were FOLLOWINGS and MEMENTO), but also a film that is able to intertwine the acting talents of three Academy Award winners.  Al Pacino plays a celebrated cop who is asked to work on the case of a murdered girl in Alaska.  Hilary Swank plays the local law enforcement who has her eyes on making a big case.  Robin Williams plays a troubled Alaskan writer.  Without giving anything away, INSOMNIA is definitely worth it.  Some may see it, and be disappointed.  One way to steer away from this failure is think of INSOMNIA as a psychological thriller rather than a ""Shoot 'em up"" thriller. INSOMNIA is story about loyalty and human emotion.  Don't get me wrong, the movie is thrill-packed, but let's just say--You don't need blood and gore to make the audience members be on the edge of their seats (which I was). INSOMNIA hits all of its points including acting, directing, screenwriting, and cinematography.  It's a first class thriller with great characters.  On a side note...Pacino is worthy of an Oscar for his performance, Williams is equally excellent, and Swank also deserves recognition for complete scope of acting.

The inability to sleep.Al Pacino plays a LA detective who is routed to a northern city in order to assist in the solving of a case involving the killing of a teen, and the methodical cleaning of the body after the crime.  In a city in which there is no darkness, Pacino finds himself having difficulty sleeping; this difficulty is deepened by the guilt that he holds for killing his own partner early on in the film.  A nice twist is entwined in the story when we are informed of a possible motive for murder that Pacino's character had. Thus, Pacino, unable to figure out if the shooting was in fact an accident or not, finds himself entirely incapable of sleep.  In another twist of fate, the girl's killer turns out to have seen Pacino killing his partner, thus putting him into a stalemate; Actually fess up to the murder, or let the killer of the girl walk free?The film was very good, with a great plot, good script and wonderful acting on all parts, namely the two title characters, Pacino and Robin Williams.I gave the film an 8.

Al Pacino is amazing and very natural.So is Robin Williams,even though it is the first time I have seen him playing the evil character. Hilary Swank is also very successful in a supporting role. The daylight and the insomnia concept which is being emphasized all throughout the movie isn't of course the mere lack of sleep itself, but it is a symbol used to show the type of conflict that Pacino's conscience is going through. The end and the universal message it puts forward is very dramatic and touching and one which I won't be able to forget for a long time. Highly recommended!",Insomnia
386,jazkat,vanilla ice-cream on white bread,4,19 October 2002,"You Have Got To Be Kidding! How could so many intelligent movie lovers be sucked into rating this film so highly. The IMDb staff should be ashamed for falling for the ""star-power"" and credentials involved in this disaster.At best, Insomnia is predictable, uninteresting, emotionally flat (except for Pacino's performance - which seemed totally out of place among such boring bland and uninteresting performances). Robin Williams is not the slightest bit convincing as a psychotic author/murderer. Swank's character was every bit as flat and lifeless as the rest. Predictable, boring, and thoroughly forgettable. There was surprisingly little emotion (anger, betrayal, bitterness, sorrow, depression, whatever) conveyed as she witnessed the fall of her hero. The plot is given away so soon that the only tension created in the film is Pacino's insomnia - which makes this film as interesting, gripping, and engaging as actually having insomnia.This is definitely not a ""Thriller"". There was no suspense throughout the whole movie. I saw it twice and waited for it - the music told me it was supposed to be there but film I saw was anticlimactic.I have to give some credit to whoever tried to save this story by throwing in the ""good cop makes a mistake""/cover-up type subplot. It was almost interesting enough to watch Pacino's character wrestle with the white nights and a crippling conscience. But then those other cardboard characters would interrupt and turn the plot focus to into vanilla ice-cream on white bread.Now, don't get me wrong, I love Robin Williams and Hillary Swank. They are extremely talented and I would probably make a point to see any movie they are in. Memento is a landmark film in independent cinema - I loved it! They all deserve the awards they received for those specific films. BUT, the ugly fact is that, despite the talent and ""star-power"", they made a bad movie together. For what ever reasons they didn't deliver performances worthy of their best work. It happens to the best. My problem is with the reviewers, critics, and educated movie buffs who ate this vanilla ice-cream on white bread and called it gourmet cuisine - just because of the names in the credits and the hardware on their mantles.

Robin Williams, who apparently strung himself thin, was in two movies that aren't going to make it very far...  this and Death to Smoochy.  Meanwhile, Al Pacino plays his overused character as it is...  overused.  The ""intrigue"" in the subplot is marginal, causing some of the extremely predictable scenes to drag even more with talk of internal affairs and some thingy with people in jail.  There's some teenage angst which is thrown in for the hell of it, and just general uninterestingness.  The insomnia scenes are also quite boring. So yeah.  It's a movie.

Williams' role as Finch is simply his gentle academic (see Good Will Hunting and Awakenings) turned desperate.Perpetually illuminated, this drama is character driven and intriguing as a study of the motivations within us.

392,Tessa-7,A great cure for insomnia,5,4 September 2002,"The summary comes courtesy of my husband, although I'm sure other people must have made the same comment about this mogadon-fuelled thriller.I was expecting something edgier and unpredictable from the director of 'Momento', but it seems that he literally lost the plot this time. What begins as a beautifully photographed and intriguing film descends into a saggy and oddly edited disappointment which seemed to go on far longer than its 2-ish hours. This time there are no plot innovations, just annoying edits to represent Dormer's (Al Pacino) symptoms of prolonged insomnia.And, oh dear, Mr Pacino's been hanging out at the Theatre of Pain again and traded in his 'Heat' subtleties for a ""from the buttocks"" 'Scent of a Woman'-style performance. He's 62, looks ten years' older but we're supposed to believe that - not only is he still employed - he can scale fences and chase villains - albeit at a sleepwalker's pace.And please don't get me started with Robin Williams! Having obviously made the winning bid at the recent ""Roles to give gravitas to Failing Comics"" auction, Robin pulls out all the stops (which includes wearing corduroy!) to convince us that he CAN do 'serious'. The problem is he can't.In taking the role of the bushy-tailed rooky, Hilary Swank has taken three steps back in her acting career, like 'Boys Don't Cry' never happened. She's a good actress and doesn't need this rubbish.Abby from 'ER' and the Alaskan landscape give winning performances but were sadly not enough to keep me awake.",Insomnia
393,ladyinterference,It's a good thing.,9,28 May 2002,"** possible minor spoilers ahead **This being my first Christopher Nolan film, I didn't know exactly what to expect with ""Insomnia"". ""Memento"" looked good enough, but a bit too arty to take in along with my film-watching buddy, i.e. my mother. ""Insomnia"", on the other hand, featured two actors good old Mom and I both like -- Al Pacino and Robin Williams -- so it was definitely something we could take in. And boy did we take it in!Christopher Nolan seems to me to be a master of using visuals as a means of advancing the plot line, which is something I've rarely experienced before while watching a movie. This is a good thing. Al Pacino so masterfully played an L.A. detective afflicted with severe insomnia as well as something that weighs down his conscience. This is another good thing. Robin Williams is absolutely delicious as a truly evil and psychotic (as well as scarily intelligent) man, something I'm not used to seeing him portray either in movies or in interviews. This is yet another good thing. Hillary Swank does well what she is supposed to do, which is to fawn over Detective Dormer at the same time that she sharpens her own detective skills. This is yet *another* good thing. In fact, the only complaint I have has been raised before by another reviewer, which is the fact that you don't really realize why Will Dormer is so nervous about IA breathing down his neck until almost toward the end of the movie (in that brilliant scene with Rachel Clement, played by Maura ""damn fine actress"" Tierney).My mother complained at the end of the movie that it went by too slowly for her, and indeed the main activity seems to be rooted in psychological play vs. pure action-driven adrenaline. If you're someone who likes thrillers to be filled with breathless chases down dark corridors and more turning heads than at a tennis match, this is quite possibly not for you. However, you would be missing an excellent film-going experience, as the movie is breathless for more intellectual reasons and everyone in the film gives their all, which rarely occurs with movies anymore.In short: brilliant movie, fantastic mental gymnastics, loved the acting, a bit too slow-paced for certain people, revelation occurs too late (but better late than never!), desperately want to see it again sometime soon.",Insomnia

This movie has a unique vision of director Christopher Nolan which takes place in far north Alaskan town which never gets dark and they refer it as "" white nights "" , and this is one of the main keys and centers all the dark events moving around . Christopher Nolan is a very intelligent director and he transfers his ' unique ' ideas to the audience through unusual ways . Its a dark movie in a non dark place and there is some sort of mystery around a girl murder occurred that local authority can't deal with . Al Pacino played the leading role as detective "" Dormer "" who is sent to investigate that murder . Since Pacino's character is not used to the constant daylight he has problems sleeping throughout the film. This lack of sleep leads Pacino's character to make huge mistakes throughout the film . While watching the film the audience feels the pain that Al Pacino is going through, while also feeling as though they have not gotten sleep for six days either , and here appears why Christopher Nolan is a great director in the modern days of cinema industry .

In this film you can predict the ending but still the story keeps you strung. So at each moment you have a feeling that the movie is going to end, but it won't, because the end you thought is yet to come. What makes this film watchable other than Al Pacino is its chilling chase sequences in the foggy waters of Alaska. The close-up shots of the actors and of movements of hands, eyes, etc were prominent. The location of the shoot totally echoed the sort of uncanny and lonely feel it needed. The way Pacino's character changes and his inner conflict is related to Insomnia, which is prominent right from the start and he shows signs of physical deterioration which grow with the moral burdens he is carrying throughout the film. Also I think Robin Williams and Hillary Swank were brilliant given the time they got.",Insomnia
399,gkmt50,A different kind of thriller (SPOILERS),8,8 June 2002,"I can understand some of the complaints of the movie being boring. It's not one of those action packed thrillers, or who-done-its. What I liked about the movie is how it seemed to me that the lines between good and evil blurred. They blurred more and more as the movie went on, to mimic the clouded state of the insomniac's perception.I normally get irritated by weird cinematic flashing back and forth, jiggling cameras, etc, but again, I feel this really worked for a movie about a cop who is unraveling from guilt. Just like the jiggly camera worked out for Blair Witch Project, in its appropriateness.This is not a movie for someone who wants a nice quick fix at the theatre. Yeah, sometimes I want a brainless thriller or comedy, or blockbuster film. But if you want an intelligent, kinda heavy psychological thriller, I think this one is great.Also, I think Robin Williams was successful in underplaying the role. In fact, I called his role Satanic. It's cunning and convincing evil that sneaks up on you...I almost believed him when he said what he did was an accident. His mild misdemeanor fits in with what Dormer says regarding a guy who has crossed the line and can remain calm (this comment also indicates why Dormer, who recently crossed the line, doesn't think twice about tainting evidence now.)I think Chris Nolan's work is very tight - in that everything that happens does so for a reason and propels the story forward.To the one confused person regarding why they went to the boy's house to find the gun...the fact that the gun matched the one that was missing and used to kill the partner...the police ""knew"" that the person who killed the partner had killed the girl. I did find it a tad awkward there, and also when Dormer knew how to get to the boy's house, like he was some local. I am going to say that probably there was some poor editing on those points.Anyway, I recommend this film, and give it at least 8 / 10",Insomnia
400,Jeremy Farrance,"Finally, A Real Movie",10,29 May 2002,"I have not seen the original, but I will.  This movie was outstanding.  I would write outstanding in all caps, but I don't feel like yelling.  Pacino was the most engaging I have seen him since Scent of a Woman.  If you are a fan of acting and love the understated, you may feel Robin Williams gives his best performance in this movie.  I definitely do.  There are so many details to pour over; questions within questions with answers that perception and perspective can and will change for you. 
Why did Dormer hold so much inside?  Do we really believe that Finch believes he is innocent?  Everyone's actions and choices ride the film forward on a tightly wound and engaging suspension of disbelief.  At one point the movie almost broke in to a typical Hollywood-style chase scene - but the director immediate derailed it, with confidence, and plunged us (literally) right back in to our insomnia-induced sense of isolation and eeriness.Dormer/Pacino is the kind of cop with a gift that we are used to in movies. But he is a flawed cop who's gift may have become a crutch.  In the back-story it may have cost him his career.  With Finch/Williams (in the present) it may be clouding his vision more than the insomnia.  If you watch Memento enough, every detail makes sense.  Not so in Insomnia, logic (for the characters) is tossed aside early; bad and good dance and almost swap places.This movie is all about the struggle, but not in a way that we are used to. The motives aren't what you think.  The good guy has strayed from the path. The bad guy is sad, driven, compassionate and intelligent - if he wasn't so willing to wear his guilt, we might like him.  I am tired of black and white characters in movies.  This movie dons the gray cloak and shows all its wonderful shades.  If you can't tell already, for me, this movie was deeply satisfying and beautiful - and a guilty pleasure I will enjoy again soon.",Insomnia
401,ariesjow,Another Nolan piece of mastery that the mediocre will pass off as mediocre.,9,12 June 2002,"For those of you unable to uncover the depth in a film you will think this film is nothing more than a typical twisted murder mystery. Nice try because it is everything but normal popcorn fare. This is not a normal good cop/bad cop scenerio like many of us without the trained or patient eye will believe. The film is full of quick flashback imagery that works to lead you up to one detail in the past that may clue you in to why Will( Al Pacino) is in the sticky situation he is in back in L.A. The remainder of the storyline up to the very end serves as a sort of ambiguity letting the audience decide if his intentions are good or bad. Walter(Robin Williams) is the trigger character as the sharp murderer. This is the most honest work I have ever seen Robin Williams pull off as he plays the psycho that seemingly leads Will farther down the wrong path. Hillary Swank plays Ellie, the young eager cop anxious on her first real murder case. If any character lacked the slightest bit of roundness it was this one, yet she ends up playing a pivotal piece of the puzzle.The editing in this film is beyond amazing...perhaps the best I have seen in recent years. The flashbacks mixed with the effects of Will's insomnia give the audience Will's mood from the beginning to the end. As usual, Chris Nolan's attention to detail is unbelievable. The only flaws of this film occur in the characterization. Will( Al Pacino) seems to flow in and out of his accent. Otherwise, this film is one perfect work.",Insomnia
402,Vaiop,Tantalizing!,7,22 May 2002,"I don't particularly care for Pacino. I have always thought of him as a one dimensional actor (same facial expressions, same voice intonation, mannerisms, etc).  Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised with his performance in Insomnia.  The movie will most certainly keep you awake, due in part to Pacino himself. His character (Will Dormer)played to his strengths.  The ""Twin Peaks"" meets ""just-about-any-other-thriller story line"", allows Pacino to personify the essence of what Insomnia is all about.  Swank and Williams complement Pacino both literally and figuratively.I have not seen the original Swedish production but Nolan wasted no time in giving his ""Insomnia"" a distinct  touch, very early on.Insomnia will not set the Box Office on fire but will impress thrill seekers and all Pacino fans.",Insomnia
403,megamatt-80194,Definitely One of Nolan's Best.,10,23 May 2020,"I didn't know what to expect from this film. Upon watching The Dark Knight Rises only a few days earlier, I had heard that this was Nolan's worst film. Well, after seeing TDKR, which is riddled with unsubtle dialogue and bland pacing, I expected Insomnia to put me to sleep.It did not. In fact, it's now in my top three of favorite Nolan films.Here's why: Al Pacino gives a riveting and quite subtle performance as a detective plagued by mistakes in his past. As the mystery of a murder in a small Alaskan town begins to get more and more interesting, we learn more about how far Pacino's character is willing to go to reach justice, but we also see him falter, and succumb to more personal demons. It's a sublime performance, and I personally think he's one of Nolan's most layered and interesting characters.All other cast performances are amazing, including a memorable turn from Hillary Swank, who plays her role with a sense of keen suspicion and humbled intellect. But, the real standout next to Pacino is Robin Williams. I will give no spoilers about his character here, but when he's onscreen, it's easy to see why Williams won an Oscar years prior. He's a master of acting innocent but disturbed all at once. A truly gripping performance, that absolutely holds its own next to Pacino's greatness.The real beauty here is Nolan's direction. The tension is palpable, and is far more engaging and riveting than the few action scenes the film has, (though the action itself is great too!) The cinematography is top-notch, and really brings you into this small town world, adding a sense of paranoia and constant fear to each scene, as if someone is always watching, and no secret is truly unknown. Nolan creates an atmosphere through the performances that is perfect, and added to the location and cinematography, all three of them blend together strongly to form a fully matured motion picture. Truly worthy of being called a ""thriller"" in every sense of the word. Nolan's pacing may be off in TDKR, but not in Insomnia. Definitely not in Insomnia.I was truly mesmerized at the moral quandaries the film presents. I can't speak too much about them since I don't want to give spoilers, but no other film I've seen, especially a detective film, has dealt and shown grief and regret in such a fascinating way. The lines in this world are grey, and even the best people make mistakes. Mistakes which the characters much learn to live with in order to fit their own justice. Its engaging questions and themes are explored in depth, and never come off as preachy.In conclusion, Insomnia is truly one of Nolan's best, and is an underrated gem. Please watch this film. It deserves, and needs to be seen. A deep exploration of morality, filled with a tense atmosphere, and wonderful performances. Films like Insomnia are cinema at its grandest.",Insomnia
404,chocojavaholic,Worthwhile drama,8,24 May 2002,"Insomnia was a solid drama, very suspenseful and well-acted. Kudos to Robin Williams for once again leaving his silliness behind and showing the world that he can truly act. As usual, it took but a minute to forget that Pacino was even acting; he literally becomes every role he's in. His insomnia was contagious; I started getting weary just feeling what he was going through.This is the first time I've seen Swank, and she was good but perhaps this is not the role that will convince me that she deserved her Academy Award.  (It was a Jodie Foster type role and I couldn't help but compare.)  Great cinematography, superb casting all the way around, wonderful story-telling.  I'd give it an 8 out of 10.",Insomnia
405,lumkinsc98,Christopher Nolan does it again!,8,24 May 2002,"First off, Christopher Nolan is one of my biggest influences when it comes to film and screen writing. With films such as Following and Memento, both of which reached cult following levels, he is well on his way to a successful Hollywood career. Then, today came, his 3rd film was released, Insomnia. Based on a 1997 Norwegian film written by Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjærg, Insomnia is a true work of art in the world of film.Christopher Nolan takes all that was the 1997 film, and brings it to the next level, using his own style of directing, a musical score with shades of Memento, and an all star cast. Al Pacino and Robin Williams pulls out the greatest performances of their careers in the past decade, if not in their ENTIRE careers in my eyes. Pacino once again excels in the role of master dective, while Williams takes this chance to show his ""dark side"", and he does it so well. I can only hope that this is a rebirth of Robin Williams, and as it stands with his upcoming film One Hour Photo (which he once again plays a dark, psychotic role), it seems to be just that! Hilary Swank also pulls out what is the greatest role of her career.Insomnia brings you in as an audience, with it's perfectly woven plot, with a film noir feel to it, just as Nolan's first two films. It is a rollercoster ride of drama and suspense as you watch Al Pacino from the very beginning unravel, and the rest of the story and his past catches up with him. I can not say much more about it, as I do not wish to spoil anything about if for you, but I do want to say this... ...go see it, right now, and enjoy. If you love crime/mystery/drama films with that wonderful Film Noir feel to it, you will love this film. If that isn't your thing, then the performances of the three main actors are worth the price of a ticket in itself. Finally I just want to say, that Insomnia proves once and for all that Christopher Nolan will indeed be a force to reckoned with in Hollywood. I've said it before, and I'll say it again... ...Christopher Nolan is well on his way to becoming the Hollywood legend which he proves he is capable of becoming.",Insomnia
406,Smush Master,No problem falling asleep here,4,7 June 2002,"I'm out of order. This film was out of order. I was looking so forward to seeing a great film, but i saw this instead. Al Pacino could have said ""hoo hah"" the whole 110 minutes of the film, and still come closer to being a decent movie. Maybe the reason he had a hard time sleeping was that he felt guilty for making this movie? He should have refused this offer.",Insomnia
407,gopikrishnan92,Nice..,7,30 May 2012,"So, Finally watched dis movie. I love Nolan's movies and dis was the last one for me to watch.. This is just an average film compared with his other films. Still, the story really haunts us. Al Pacino, was not bad in d film, nor the others.. But the storyline can't be considered perfect. Everything is not blended smoothly..There are many things i didn't like. I don't like to mention it here. But the director has succeeded in framing the images in the eyes of a man, who couldn't sleep for many days. He was suffering from insomnia, he couldn't sleep because of his actions in his past. cinematography is just great. Overall, an above average film, that's worth watching, and not beyond that..",Insomnia
408,skotgp,A real wakeup call for Robin Williams fans.,8,10 February 2003,"Far from a fast paced action thriller, this somewhat film noir piece is one of the more disquieting movies I've watched in quite some time.  Virtually all the cast's performances are right on target, although at times, Pacino's character seems a bit over-the-top.  The script is nothing particularly special, but it does provide a great vehicle for especially Swank and Williams to excel.It's not that I haven't enjoyed Robin Williams' dramatic forays in the past.. especially 'Dead Poets Society.'  But there is something exceptionally evil about his version of Walter Finch that stems, at least for me, from the deeply ingrained belief that Williams is a nice guy.  I had a similar feeling with Michael Keaton in Pacific Heights.  The expectation that at some moment the character would revert to its unhinged, off-center, comedic lunacy.  And when it doesn't it is truly frightening.It does take a fair amount of patience to watch this rather slow, psychologically-heavy film, but it is worth it and, if it weren't for the somewhat disappointing ending (no spoiler intended because you may love it), it would get even higher marks.",Insomnia
409,Zambelli,Why would anyone want to remake an already excellent film?,7,1 June 2002,"**** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!! ****If you ever read or heard any interviews with film directors, you might've noticed that they often get asked the question, ""If you could direct one movie that's already been made, what would it be?"", hoping that the directors would answer something along the lines of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" or Bergman's ""Seventh Seal."" I'm sure Christopher Nolan probably would've answered ""Erik Skjoldbjaerg's 'Insomnia'"". The problem is that Nolan took the question literally. Instead of admiring Skjoldbjaerg's film, he attempted to make it again.What happened to the great director of ""Memento""? Did he really sell his soul to the Hollywood machine? Fans and critics would certainly hope otherwise, but unfortunately, from watching Nolan's ""Insomnia"" it seems like the British filmmaking prodigy has gone completely mainstream.Nolan's ""Insomnia"" is a heavily Americanized version of Skjoldbjaerg's femomenal Norwegian film. And when I say ""Americanized"", I'm not just talking about the movie taking place in Alaska. Oh no, I'm talking about all the melodrama and glitter of Hollywood movies that are so difficult to avoid on the big screen nowadays. Subplots are introduced to ""spice up"" the story, relationships between characters are changed, all the original subtlety is gone, and the two principal characters lack all original depth and are pigeonholed into the Hollywood ""good guy - bad guy"" scheme.In the original ""Insomnia"", the cop character (his name was Jonas Engstrom but I will refer to him as ""the cop"", to avoid confusion) was a Swedish detective who was sent to northern Norway to investigate a murder. Through an overheard conversation, we find out that back in Stockholm he got intimately involved with a young witness from a case he was working on. So his assignment in Norway was a sort of ""punishment"". In the movie, this is mentioned only once and never again. In the American version, a whole subplot about Internal Affairs investigations is introduced and it has a great affect on the relationships in the movie. In the original film, the cop and his partner are great friends. In the remake, there is a hostility between them because of the whole Internal Affairs investigation going on back in Los Angeles. So in the original movie when the cop shoots his partner accidentally, it is primarily the guilt of shooting his friend that he has to deal with.Another aspect that is completely downplayed in Nolan's version is the cop's sense of alienation in a foreign land. In the original, the cop is a Swede. He is perceived as a foreigner and an outsider throughout his entire investigation. He is never accepted; in fact, he is often ridiculed for his accent by both cops and civilians. In Nolan's film, the cop is quickly accepted by the locals. We see them chatting away about guns, drinking beer together, and at the end we get the feeling like they're almost sad to see him go.Nolan gave Hilary Swank much more screen time then her character had in the original. In Skjoldbjaerg's ""Insomnia"", the female cop merely investigates the second murder, but never interferes with the original investigation. Yes, she does figure out that the cop shot his partner, but she doesn't do anything about it. In the American version, we see her trying to arrest the real murderer, only to be incapacitated by him - and then Al Pacino, of course, has to come to the rescue.And finally, the biggest difference between the two movies is that the character of the cop (Will Dormer/Jonas Engstrom) has been completely polished up in the American remake. In the remake, Al Pacino plays a good cop who uses some illegal methods to bring bad guys to justice (planting evidence and such). But hey, as long as he's reeling in bad guys, it's all good, right? :) He doesn't believe in political mumbo-jumbo, he only wants to do his job right. When a local teenage girl (and best friend of the murdered girl) tries to seduce him, he wisely avoids it and instead teaches her a lesson. He despises the murderer and he tries to prevent the murderer from framing an innocent kid. In the end, he dies like a hero, killing the bad guy and saving Hillary Swank's integrity. Damn. That's one good cop!Now let's take a look at Stellan Skarsgard's interpretation of the cop character. We find out early he's already been in trouble for being unable to cross a line between his work and his private life. When he shoots his friend accidentaly, he panics and covers up his crime, but he never considers telling the truth. His only concern is his own job - he has no other motives. Remember that scene in the American version where Al Pacino shoots a dead dog in an alley? Well, Stellan Skarsgard shoots a live dog! Take that, ASPCA! Furthermore, he frames the innocent young man himself, without any assistance from the real murderer. He tries to take advantage of a young girl in his car. When talks to the murderer, we don't get the feeling that he despises him. No, we get the feeling that he understands him. And finally, in the end, he does kill the real murderer, but he doesn't die himself. His own crime is covered up and he returns to Sweden. He is a cop with many flaws. And as such, he makes a much stronger character. The point of Skjoldbjaerg's movie was to erase the line between cop and criminal. There's no good guy and bad guy in his movie. It's a psychological thriller, where the suspense isn't derived from chase sequences across timber logs, but from the complexity of the main character.These are such fundamental differences between the two versions. If you change the characters, change the relationships and change the outcome, you've pretty much created a completely different movie. And as good as Nolan's movie is as a standalone project, as a remake it utterly fails because it takes away from the original all the qualities that made it such a great film. It is unfortunate for Nolan that he has wasted his time remaking an already great film. If this was his way of proving his skills, it was completely unnecessary. We already knew that he was a talented director. But hopefully this movie will get Nolan the money and the attention that he needs in order to create a truly excellent and ORIGINAL movie - one that we can all appreciate on its own.See Erik Skjoldbjaerg's ""Insomnia"". See Christopher Nolan's ""Insomnia"". They're both fine films, but Skjoldbjaerg's film definitely has the edge - there's no doubt about it.P.S. Did I get that right, or did Al Pacino's character really not sleep for 6 days straight? Isn't that humanly impossible? In the original movie, I'm pretty sure Stellan Skarsgard gets some sleep occasionally. He is chronically tired, that's true, but he's not a walking zombie. Nolan, as a writer himself, must know all about insomnia, as I'm sure he's had quite a few insomniac nights himself. But he should also equally well know that after 24 hours without sleep, fatigue will catch up with anyone, regardless of the amount of light coming into your room or the number of cops you've accidentally killed.",Insomnia
410,Brandonjohansen22,A twisted tale of bad and evil,8,11 June 2007,"Academy Award Winner's Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank star in the intriguing thriller, Insomnia. Pacino plays veteran LAPD officer, Detective Will Dormer who has been summoned from Los Angeles to investigate the brutal murder of a young teenage girl in Nightmute, Alaska. Hilary Swank is under utilized Nightmute police officer, Detective Ellie Burr who idolizes and admires most of Detective Dormer's case history. Robin Williams on the other side of the law enforcement spectrum is local author Walter Finch, who has ties to the homicide victim. Detective Dormer becomes delirious after going several days without sleep hence the title, Insomnia. Dormer's distraught demeanor derives from either the murder of his partner or the fact it is always daylight in this part of Alaska. Whatever it might be Dormer isn't the cop he has been for the past 30 years and is letting this killer get into his head. Once the plot unravels, Dormer and Finch realize they need each other to ensure their own freedom. After that there is no turning back , Insomnia grabs you by the shirt pulling you into this twisted tale of bad and evil. Although Detective Dormer is brilliant in his every move, Ellie Burr can only be described as Jepordy smart as she seems to be much more clever than she is credited. In the end someone finally get some shut eye, someone gets what they deserved and someone gets a great lesson in law enforcement principals. To be honest you might as well chalk this up as yet another classic for all three of these Academy Award Winners.",Insomnia

What can one expect when you have Al PAcino and Hilary Swank in great parts, along with Robin Williams in a villains role. All three more than hold their own,especially Al Pacino, who played the role of a police detective who is investigating the murder of a young Alaskan girl while being tormented by his insomnia, brought on by the never ending daylight of summer alaska. The insomnia, which the killer also has, is a major symbolic point, and the movie is laden with them, as well as suspense and psychological tension. Excellently written, beautifully acted, and superbly directed (Christopher Nolan pulls it off again), along with fantastic cinematography proves Insomnia as a thriller to go down in the great movies hall of Fame.",Insomnia

413,zyzygy69,Flashbacks vs. hallucinations,10,27 May 2002,"If anyone thought Memento should have received more than one AA nomination last year and for more than just best original screenplay, just wait. I believe the academy's penchant for rewarding those they wrongly overlooked before may well hold true this year. Insomnia is not only as beautiful a film visually, but naturally more accessible to mainstream viewing (in the BEST sense of those words). No one is going to get a migraine trying to keep up with this treat. The casting is once again superb, and, with the single exception of Larry Holden, totally new. Most good directors have a tendency to use a regular stable of actors (a la Brad Pitt in David Fincher films). Pacino turns in one of his best performances. Period. I have personally suffered from insomnia over the years, and I felt downright exhausted at moments from mere empathy. Robin Williams is just as good bad as one would hope. I can now forgive him for Patch Adams (although he still owes me for Bicentennial Man). The plot moves fluidly with no huge surprises (at least to me, but that also jibes with Memento), but the flawless execution of the suspense archetypes proves not only palatable, but tasty. Hollywood should have no trouble recognizing the beauty of this film as the bandage for the cuts of negligence of Art-gone-by.",Insomnia
414,Djeus,A really distinctive detective story,10,29 September 2002,This is more than an ordinary thriller or detective story which Hollywood produces by the dozens these days. I surely like this kind a bit original thriller that has done something for its plot.Al Pacino is great as meticulous detective Dormer. I think you just got to love his relaxed way of acting. However there is much more in detective Dormers character than meets the eye. Robin Williams also does a great role in this film. I personally think his character is one of the best you ever see in these thrillers. His character is also one you should not judge at first sight.This is really a moving story about human motivation. A look into the human mind and what a human is capable of. In the end you wonder just how you got there.Personally I find the lack of too much violence especially delighting. I think you should not make a thriller (or any other kind of movie) if you got nothing else to offer but violence. There are in this film some rough scenes however so I would not recommend this to the youngest in the family.,Insomnia
415,with_the_flames_i_die126,"Insomnia: an excellent thriller, and vintage Christopher Nolan",9,20 December 2011,"Insomnia is a great thriller with great characters, music, twists and turns, and is just what you expect when you see a Christopher Nolan film. I first saw Insomnia quite a few years ago now, and while I thought it was good, I was not blown away like I am with most of his other films. Because of that, I overlooked it and did not give it the credit it deserves. Re-watching it however, I can fully appreciate the film for the wonderful thriller it is, and not what I expected it to be. Based of a Norwegian film of the same name, Insomnia stars Al Pacino as Detective Will Dormer, who is sent to Alaska do investigate a murder of a teenage girl with another LAPD detective. We quickly find out Dormer is somewhat of a legend among detectives; a local police officer Ellie Burr, played by Hillary Swank, had even done her college case study on him. Although a great detective, Dormer is about to be investigated by Internal Affairs for what happened on one of his previous cases, which is one of the main reasons he is in Alaska. Revealing anymore could be potential spoilers, so I will end the plot summary there. The performances in Insomnia are excellent. Every character has their own view of what is happening in Alaska, and the performances back up these views. Swank's character Burr is an excited, young officer dying to be put on something more than misdemeanors. She is eager to take any advice Dormer may offer, and although inexperienced, she is determined to investigate all possible circumstance and catch the murderer. Dormer knows how to catch a killer, and knows one when he sees one. His job is complicated however, when he discovers it does not get dark where he is at, and is unable to sleep, hence the title Insomnia. Pacino does an excellent job at looking exhausted all of the time, and also allowing the lack of sleep to influence his thinking, and ability to do his job. It is great watching him on screen. Robin Williams, who is also in this movie, delivers a great performance himself, straying away from the comedic roles he usually plays. He is also wonderful to watch. One of the strongest aspects of Insomnia is the music. David Julyan does an excellent job creating an eerie, depressing, and almost hopeless feeling score that fits this film perfectly. I do not think it is as good as his Memento score, but they are both very similar and his score definitely adds to Insomnia. I hope when Nolan is done with the Batman trilogy he works with David Julyan again. I love the scores they put together for Memento, Insomnia, and The Prestige, and it would be great to hear more of those types again. I love what he does with Hans Zimmer, the main Batman theme gives me goosebumps just about every time, but I also enjoy these softer scores once in a while. The story in Insomnia is very good too, but there are a few plot holes that do not get addressed. There are also a few moments that I think real cops would have found something they did not, or check something they did not. These instances are pretty uncommon though, and definitely do not distract from the film for long. Still it would have been nice to see a few of these cleaned up to ensure more believability. Overall, Insomnia gets a 9 out of 10 for me. Great actors, characters, music and a good, solid story with few holes is something every thriller should have. It is classic Christopher Nolan; it has everything you would expect in one of his films. I also believe a rating of 7.2 on IMDb is a little low, it should be at least above a 7.5. Maybe being a remake, or not marketed correctly contribute to this. Regardless of the reasons, Insomnia is and excellent thriller that is definitely worth being checked out.",Insomnia

I can't add much to the review by Giancarlo, except that I think music could have played a more prominent more, but maybe in this case, 'less is more'. Pacino is excellent, the progression of his character through the movie is so real, you feel what he is going through. The meeting between him an William's is great stuff...""You don't get it.

Nonetheless, he does it well enough, considering he's working out of his style and up against with two drama pros Pacino and Swank.There's no mystery, because we know who did it early on, the drama lies elsewhere, and it's a really good story.There's a lot of great scenes, just one great scene after another.

419,theoriginalsandman,Another Nolan Masterpiece.,8,2 May 2008,"Following the success of his sleeper hit Memento, Christopher Nolan has once again managed to achieve similar results with this remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.The film is set in Nightmute, Alaska which is in perpetual daylight due to its (misrepresented) location above the Arctic Circle.Al Pacino stars as Will Dormer, a burnt-out, detached yet dedicated and highly-decorated detective from the LAPD's Robbery/Homicide Division enlisted to assist the local police force of Nightmute, Alaska after the naked body of a young local girl is found brutally battered to death.Hilary Swank exudes in her role of a fresh rookie detective who virtually hero worships Dormer and is anxiously excited at the opportunity of working alongside him. Swank carries off her role excellently as she struggles to impress Dormer while attempting to decipher his unorthodox methods.Unsurprisingly, Pacino completely steals the show as he effortlessly portrays the deterioration of Dormer's mental and physical stability due to insomnia as a result of being unaccustomed to the perpetual daylight. Further exacerbating the matter is Dormer being methodically scrutinized by Internal Affairs for the suspicious discrepancies of his past cases.Robin Williams breaks away from his usual comedic roles and thrusts the viewer into a rarely seen 'darker' side of himself with his portrayal as a shrewd, analytical yet deeply disturbed character who constantly mocks and plagues Dormer's investigations.The seamless and beautifully woven plot of Insomnia will undeniably leave you unable to tear yourself away from the screen as the film progresses. The film manages to slowly unravel its uniquely articulate neo-noir nature interspersed with Dormer's tainted past steadily catching up with him and Nolan wraps his signature cinematic style around the thought-provoking storyline. The moment you press Play, be prepared to be unforgivingly sucked into this film and grapple with the stellar quality of acting shown by Pacino, Williams and Swank. The surreal setting of Nightmute's perpetual daylight temporarily alleviates the darkness of the film but progressively shrouds the characters as the investigation intensifies and more unanswered questions turn up. Nolan peppers the film with incredible minute details which serve to entangle you even further.If you're already a fan of Nolan's work like me, I have no doubt you will thoroughly enjoy this film but in the event that you're not, this will undoubtedly hermetically seal your respect for him and the one-of-a-kind 'feel' of his movies.I consider this one of Nolan's finest works and I give it a solid two thumbs up and would highly recommend the average movie junkie to experience the mystifyingly addictive nature of Nolan's films by watching this brilliant masterpiece.",Insomnia
420,Chirofun,Saw the original....Next night saw the remake.....SEE THE ORIGINAL,7,9 April 2012,"I don't really want to say the remake is a ""bad"" movie. If I hadn't seen the original first (the Norwegian original), I probably would think the Hollywood version was just a LITTLE bit better than it was. However, having seen the original, I was disappointed in the remake and that brought the flick down a peg. There are some HUGE differences between the two, although basically the same plot, of course.It seemed to me that the remake had the potential to be EVEN BETTER than the original, which in my opinion was GREAT. Hollywood movies tend to be ""bigger"" all over than their foreign counterparts...more action, faster paced, more animated, better movie sets, more ""blockbuster"" if you will. Having said that, I really don't go for the whole Schwarzenegger explosion chase scene mow 'em down with your machine gun good guy bad guy thing anyway (OK I'll give ya Star Wars...but that's pretty much it....and please note it's Schwarzeneggerless). My biggest fear was that Hollywood would turn this into yet another F bomb loaded bang bang shoot 'em up cop story. My worst fear was pretty much confirmed. I'm not a prude. I'm not against violence in film (IF it ADDS to the film and is NOT ""gratuitous."") But the GREAT thing about the original is that the LACK of ""blockbuster"" elements makes it a really TAUT, TIGHT, TENSION FILLED, PSYCHOLOGICAL SLOWBURN, and THAT made the ""creepiness"" of the film much more visceral and consistently sustained throughout (maybe along the lines of something like ""Blood Simple""?). Moreover, the ending of the original film was the icing on the already delicious, well crafted cake.It wouldn't be fair to kill the remake completely. The plot line sells itself, and there are more twists and turns in the remake (perhaps TOO many to suspend disbelief, though). Maybe this is simply because everyone talks so much faster than in the original and it's faster paced, and therefore there's more room to insert ""more bang for your buck"". It's not ALL bad, though, because Al Pacino was excellent, and Robin Williams was the best thing out of EITHER movie (that man is actually a comedian???...with a MAJOR LEAGUE creep factor like THAT??? He was impeccable.) There's more ""banter"" in the remake, and the Robin Williams character was expanded, and those were pluses. However, it just doesn't make up for the typical, Hollywood ""let's throw this in and that in and have police cars racing with sirens blaring"" (when it's unnecessary and counterproductive if you want to actually SOLVE a crime) ""and if we throw enough stuff in we'll have an action packed thriller alright...and who cares about suspension of disbelief anyway as long as we can make it so we have that climactic bang bang shoot 'em up at the end?"" Sighhhhhhh. Ugh. I should have known. What a letdown.You certainly won't sleep through Insomnia (2002), but sadly, this one is MUCH more ""predictable"" (""formulaic"") than the original (1997), and it's frustrating. It could have been so very good, and it had the potential to be even BETTER than the Norwegian original (as excellent as it is). On the bright side, SEE THE ORIGINAL, do it on a night where you're not in a rush, and turn the lights out (no pun intended on that ""bright side"" thing, although it DOES work for the film's very clever 24 hours of daylight reverse film noir motif now that I think of it). I'm not a horror movie fan, and this is not a horror movie...but the original was actually quite creepy in several ways, you will not have to suspend disbelief ANYWHERE NEAR AS MUCH, and it DEFINITELY is engaging despite the relatively slow pace (in fact the ""slow"" pace actually ADDS to the ""taut"", ""creepy"" feeling in general). The best compliment I can give the Norwegian production is that it certainly is a WELL CRAFTED piece of film making. See it. The 1997 original doesn't disappoint.",Insomnia

The film casts Al Pacino in the main role, as a detective for Police Department of Los Angeles. The film has amazing cinematography with scenes being shot in Alaska I presume. All the scenes are beautifully shot, and they are eye catching.After watching 'Memento,' I found him very intriguing and ingenious with his style of directing and approach to film making. He is well-known in this movie industry and his movies are a solid evidence to why this is true.Even though Al Pacino looks very old in this movie, I found his role satisfactory as a detective. The movie has a lot of things to grasp your attention for 118 minutes. The film takes twist and turns throughout the movie. A perfect drama, crime thriller for you and by the way this movie can be watched by with your family (if they don't mind some gore obviously, no sexual scenes are in the movie).I'm just gonna say that I was not satisfied by the ending, that's the reason for the rating.",Insomnia

Don't go expecting just a bunch of explosions and gunfights because this is more of a psychological thriller, with the main focus on Detective Dormer's (Al Pacino) inner struggle. I appreciated that besides being entertaining, the movie actually has something to say but doesn't beat you over the head with it. The cast is great, there were a few things about the camera work and nit-picky stuff like that that kept me from liking it more, but overall I say this is definitely one to see, especially for fans of Al Pacino.",Insomnia

As for Nolan, Memento had an ethereal charm in being stitched together by cat gut. This is plain bull. Robin Williams is plain wasted, both as a comic and as an actor. There is no hope of spoiling this movie for anyone, it is way beyond that by itself, but still I should abstain from cussing in depth about it.

The longer Will (Pacino) went sleepless, the more sounds started to bother him, only this occurred in certain scenes, but not in others. What happened to them? Why did they only interrupt his thoughts when he was in the police station but not on the ferry? And Williams as a bad guy is just bad. I couldn't understand why Will didn't just by some sleeping pills, like Unisom or Tylenol PM. There are ways to make a person go to sleep.

430,int32,comparing two Insomnias,7,21 April 2005,"I was searching through IMDb for comparisons between original Norwegian Insomnia from 1997 and Hollywood's Insomnia 2002, to find out whether it is worth to see the latter, and not to repeat the experience I've had with Vanilla Sky and Abre Los Ojos. It is not that I dislike the VS, but ALO obliterates the impression from VS completely, so I wondered if I should bother renting I02 (Insomnia 2002) at all. Well, I was surprised that I02 is worth viewing _even_ after I97. So, here I'll try to write for those who also wonder which one's better.First, both are very good films, with excellent actors' work, graphics, and music, and I won't compare these. But I believe that I02 scenario is a bit flawed, because where I97 gives less or no reason at all for a particular response or action of a character, I02 invariably puts things so that the same response or action is the only choice for the character. To put it bluntly, psychologically I97 is more like a David Lynch's movie, whereas I02 resembles more a thriller with Michael Douglas, where all pieces are meant to move by a strictly defined orbit, a brilliant but still somewhat dumbed down version. I personally value the former kind of movies more, so naturally I97 gets more of my credit.So, if you can, see both, I97 and then I02 ( at least I've seen them in that order ), but if you only want to choose just one, I97 would be, in my opinion, better.",Insomnia

It was a follow up to his debut film, Following which I have yet to see. Nolan is known to make thrilling, brainy and twisted movies like Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight and the new masterpiece, Inception. This was the beginning of brilliance that would just keep going uphill. Insomnia is a movie with an intense plot, great acting and amazing direction.Al Pacino and Robbin Williams are spot on with their acting. Al Pacino is one of the best actors out there. Robbin Williams is no less either. Al Pacino's dialog delivery is spot on and his emotions are portrayed perfectly. Even Hillary Swank does a great as Ellie Burr.The direction is great. Of course it's not the same masterful direction which Nolan will do later in his hits like Prestige and Inception but you can see his talent here. A few aerial shots in the beginning and the underwater shot in the chase scene are great. The plot is nice too. It's not as twisted as Memento or Prestige but it evokes immense emotion and shows what really guilt is and what people can do to hide their mistakes.Overall, it's an awesome movie and definitely worth a watch!",Insomnia

This movie is a totally different one and by the time it ends, I'm sure you'll stay awestruck for a while lost in the movie itself. Whenever we sit to watch a crime mystery thriller, we have that pre- conception in our mind of how the movie will be- someone's killed, the detective's hell-bent on catching the criminal, but the criminal's too smart and so on. But that's an explicit concept of a crime mystery thriller. Have you ever thought of what's the personality of the detective and the criminal? And how does that affect the whole crime puzzle?

436,bdogg_2001,"Very well done, keeps viewer interested throughout",8,11 November 2006,"This movie was quite brilliant on many levels. I found myself rewinding every time I missed a line, wanting to get the full picture in my head. If you are are the kind of movie-goer that watches this hoping it will be a cat-and-mouse detective movie with lots of action or anything along those lines, this movie is almost sure to disappoint you. It's the kind of movie that will make you think more and more as the story unfolds, mostly about the line between good and bad. The more you watch, the less defined that line will be. This movie will make the viewer see the ways of good and bad in a more practical way, and different viewers will surely have a different view on what's right and wrong in this sense. That is what I really liked about this movie, the fact that I second-guessed every thought I had about what is right and what is wrong in regards to the plot. More than this, you will probably find yourself questioning the main characters and their motives, and you will especially question the interactions between Pacino and Williams, wondering how much of what they say is truth and how much is deceit. The relationship between these two characters provokes many thoughts from the viewer, and is one of the best aspects of the movie, in my opinion. Pacino's reluctance and William's dependence on their helping each other out really keeps the viewer guessing what actions will be taken and will put the question in his/her head: what do I think is the right thing to do in this situation? If you are a fan of Christopher Nolan or enjoy movies that provoke thoughts, I can almost assure you that you will enjoy this one. If you are the kind that finds entertainment mostly in action, special effects, and overused plot lines (which I don't think are necessarily bad), then you may or may not like this movie depending on who you are. Overall, I think that about 9/10 people would enjoy this one.",Insomnia
437,dostoyevsky,good movie,9,23 September 2002,"I have read some of these online reviews, and have come to the conclusion that most people missed the point completely.  The movie is about crossing the line or breaking the social contract, and the moral decisions that it entails.  Robin Williams isn't a psychopath, even though he could definetly be called an eccentric failing writer.  Nevertheless, he crossed the line that has been outlined for people by the social contract that in a sense has been promulgated through christianity.  Of course, I'm getting a little off topic, but the fact remains that the ending revolves around the idea of owning up to what you may have or have not done.  The idea of it being light outside all day only accentuates the fact that it is associated with being awake.  Conversley, night is associated with sleep, and the subconscious doesn't allow either one of the main characters to sleep for long.  If you're looking for a hollywoodesque blockbuster about a cop chasing down a criminal out of vengence or whatever it might be, this movie is not for you. This is far deeper.  I've seen two (Memento and Insomnia) of Nolan's three movies, and I think he has to be considered one of the best contemporary directors.",Insomnia

440,mynameisalreadychosen1,Good but not captivating,7,1 May 2002,"Insomnia is director Christopher Nolan's follow up to Memento. It's not as good as his previous film but it's not bad. The film begins with Al Pacino's character, a cop from L.A., going to Alaska to investigate a murder. He arrives with another cop from Los Angeles. The film immediately spins into a routine serial killer movie with Al Pacino discovering info that the Alaskan cops had no knowledge of. The first 30 minutes of the movie are really, really boring. Suddenly, Robin Williams shows up and the movie takes off. Williams is perfect in this role and surprisingly he's completely serious. Once Williams comes on the screen, the film becomes more than just a normal serial killer movie with a few minor twists and some good original ideas. Hillary Swank plays one of the Alaskan cops and she's just plain out of place in this movie. It's not that she does a bad acting job but she just doesn't fit. As for Christopher Nolan, he does a decent but not award worthy job in the director's chair. With some wild editing, this film does bear some resemblance to Memento but not much. This film is much less confusing and also not as stylish. Overall, it's a good serial killer movie.",Insomnia

I had originally heard that due to insomnia, Pacino wasn't even sure if he had killed his partner, and that sounded intriguing. The fact that in the end he wasnt sure of his motivation was very unconvincing. There are no smart twists in this movie. In my opinion the acting wasn't that great either, just because Pacino looked like he hasnt slept in a week doesn't make for a great performance, because thats pretty much the way he looks all the time, same with that crappy In The Bedroom movie, just because Sissy Spacek looked burned out and crazy doesnt mean she gave a great performance, shes looks like that naturally. There were a few decent parts to the movie, like when Pacino was trying to stay awake driving and almost left the road, but that doesnt make up for the rest fo the crap. The detective work was alright too, better then an Ace Ventura movie anyways but overall the movie wasn't good at all. When I check my watch several times during a movie and finally leave, never wanting to watch that movie again I know it isnt a good movie. I should have watched Undervocer Brother.",Insomnia
442,Robertdeluca,"Good, but not great",7,26 May 2002,"In a year where the film product tumbling out of Hollywood is mediocre at best, ""Insomnia"" looks like a masterpiece.  Not quite.  Christopher Nolan's followup to the inimitable ""Memento"" doesn't quite reach those heghts of originality.  The movie is good, but not the great piece of filmmaking that most critics would have you believing it is.Why?  Al Pacino has done the Weary Cop Thing before (think ""Sea of Love"") so playing this part isn't much of a stretch, and I personally think he's a bit old to be playing the cop and chasing suspects over floating logs etc. Hilary Swank still hasn't found a sufficient followup role after her triumph in ""Boys Don't Cry,"" and she basically follows the Pacino character around. Most importantly, what hampers ""Insomnia 2002"" is the Hollywood ending, the obligatory shootout, the baddies are subdued, and good triumphs.  I expected more ambiguity and less predictability from a truly innovative director like Nolan, and he let me down.  Succumbing to the standard Hollywood finale may ensure Nolan a lengthy and profitable career in Tinseltown, but a sellout is a sellout is a sellout.To digress a bit, wouldn't ""Panic Room"" have been a more effective movie if Forrest Whitaker just left with the loot, didn't return to the house, and left Jodie Foster to her own devices?  Now that's an ending, not perfect one, not a happy one, but better than what was given to the moviegoer.I'm not a Robin Williams fan, but I sincerely hope he's remembered next February when Oscar nominations roll out.  He was creepy, calculating, pathetic, and simply scary in his part.  As for everyone else, I say it's on to the next project.",Insomnia

Like nearly all of his films, there are ""flashback"" cuts throughout the movie that don't gain meaning until later. Conceptually, you'll notice this film is very similar to another of Nolan's films - The Prestige. Both interestingly parallel the protagonist and antagonist rather than pit them against one another. This film, however, is more mature and realistic for Nolan. Whether you're a fan of Nolan or not, I'd give this movie a go.Acting is no shortcoming here. Pacino's character is played brilliantly. He first arrives as a cool and wittily intelligent detective, but he spirals into a pseudo-consciousness as his insomnia gets to him. Pacino's tired face is enough to play the part, but the exhaustion in his voice and demeanor seals the deal. Robin Williams' character is masterfully acted as well. He is convincing to the audience and demanding of empathy. With Hillary Swank's portrayal of the naive and innocent junior detective, this movie offers three solid performances.I'm reluctant to complain about this movie, but the climax is unfortunately deserving. The climactic point in the film was drawn out too much and somewhat cheesy. While it is disappointing to have such a complaint about an otherwise terrific film, it doesn't spoil it. This movie is still typical Nolan - gripping, intelligent and undeniably thought provoking.",Insomnia

And Nolan really uses this and plays with this in the final moments of the film. When Dormer is about to die from his wounds, he says to Durr ""just let me sleep"". I think that really rounds up the movie and connects the dots. Beautiful really, and a bit comedic. Nolan plays a interesting twist on the relationship between the good and the bad guy, and mixes them up real good. Once again Nolan livs up to his fantastic way of creating. I also love the way he uses the camera lens to paint a picture of how it is inside Dormers head, as his mind slowly devours.

451,txbangert,Dumbed down remake of fine Norwegian original,3,22 July 2007,"Movie Reviews =============Insomnia -------- Everything about this remake reeks of an attempt to censor the original Norwegian film. While no masterpiece, the central attraction of the original film is the morally ambiguous central figure. Outwardly a sophisticated metropolitan hero detective who always get his man and who presents an image of virtue and integrity, the real person is very different. Initially we buy into the image of hero, but the more we see how he operates in private the more we begin to doubt his moral integrity. Everything he does after we are initially introduced to him seems to cast further doubt on his character, and it seems that he is sinking into a quagmire partly of his own making. In the end a fortuitous events resolve matters, the crime is solved and the hero leaves town basking in the glory of another success. All the messy details are packed up and swept away. And so it is of great surprise that the Hollywood remake, like some nasty corporate censor, erases every single act which shows the protagonists moral slide downwards. First of all our expectations are dampened in the remake by making the protagonist not a hero cop, but a cop who is being investigated by internal affairs and sent into 'exile' for various misdeeds in the past. He seems a decent guy, but then his own partner says he is going to inform on him. He admits to out and out framing a criminal in at least one case. This it seems weighs heavily on his mind. This makes him a rather tarnished police officer. We are also not really given any indication of past heroism or why other police officers would look up to him. The original introduces the protagonist as an effective investigator as he takes charge, finds new clues, makes television broadcasts and so on. This is missing in the remake. He remarks as an aside that the murderer has washed the victims's hair, but it doesn't sink in. The introduction ends when the partner is shot and killed and we begin the moral descent.First we meet a rebellious stroppy teen who wants something 'exciting'. The protagonist gives her an extended and unpleasant grope before showing her the place where the body of her friend was found. In the remake this is deleted and the protagonist plays a game of chicken with an oncoming truck instead, which is stupid, out of character as well as pointless. Next we meet a dog that is destined to receive the substitute bullet. Our protagonist has killed his partner (by accident) and the bullet will eventually identify him. During a gun battle with the villain, our protagonist by chance finds the villains gun, something he keeps to himself. Having the villain's gun in his possession he shoots something with it, digs out the bullet and replaces it with the one the coroner found. The dog acts as substitute for a human gunshot victim. In the original the shooting of the dog is quite a gruesome episode. In the remake, the dog is already dead! It is a rotting corpse.As he descends further into the moral quagmire (symbolized by his battle with the sun and inability to sleep) he just about rapes the hotel receptionist. In the remake she has sex with him (which we are left to assume was pleasant and consensual) to stop him from disturbing his neighbours.And then the protagonist is dead! Villain and protagonist kill each other. The end! The original has a 'hollywood' ending where the villain is dead/caught and everything is back to normal. But the remake removes the Hollywood ending and kills off the protagonist. The horror, the horror!The remake does have a few redeeming features. The scenery from Alaska is nice and the small town is well presented. The dash over the log filled pond is quite nice. Al Pacino as the protagonist is very good, as is Robin Williams as the villain. Al Pacino though is let to overact, when the protagonist should generally be more understated. The actress who plays the female rookie is also quite good.The action scenes also do not work in the remake, with the exception of the log chase scene. In the original the protagonist is almost killed in the chase scene. That is deleted. The cable car scene where the protagonist catches up with the villain is brilliant. No action is possible during the cable car and instead they have a 'quiet' chat. One would think that with a Hollywood budget and a Hollywood production they could have at least improved upon the original's rather limited and drab action scenes.",Insomnia

Pushing it a bit? Maybe. However, his Thrillers are growing in stature now and the creation of tension is superb.Insomnia features a sterling cast performance, obviously with Messrs Pacino and Williams deserving a lot of credit in their part of creating very strong characters. Pacino's performance as the tormented insomniac detective Will Dormer is as magnificent as it is subtle. His haggard face lifeless as he grows into a deeper spiral of sleep deprivation, guilt and despair. This is definatley as good as any work Pacino has done before. Williams is quite a revelation as the twisted Walter Finch and wholly believable. Hilary Swank in the supporting role as the eager young detective is as usual great.The atmosphere in the film is it's crowning glory, the collision between the claustrophobic interiors of the Police station and Walter Finch's home to the vast and beautiful Alaskan vistas. The lack of action gives way to a superb psychological battle between Dormer and Finch giving a great Hitchcock-esque (there I said it) final sequence.

With such an all-star cast, some movies have been known to become to cluttered trying to get everyone their share of screen time, but this was not the case. Everyone served their role perfectly and Pachino gives a very Oscar caliber performance. I gotta say though, Nolan has released both his movies far away from Oscar time. I think that hurt him last year with Memento but hopefully won't hurt him this year. I'm guessing the high-octane cast will keep this movie in Oscar voters minds for the upcoming nominations.

463,veturisarma,Neither Nolan..Nor Pacino,6,17 June 2011,"I had great expectations from Nolan and Pacino collaboration but those were never even acknowledged, let alone met by Insomnia. The film is neither a Pacino drama, nor a Nolan brainy thriller and in fact the props like insomnia and the Alaskan landscapes rather than the story itself, are what make the film bearable. Pacino, as we all know has got bigger teeth, but Nolan does not give him much to dig them into as he manages a meek film, its visual splendor and Pacino's intense, brooding performance notwithstanding.Nolan's mark was conspicuous by its absence much to my chagrin as the story unfolded in a linear format, which was entirely unexpected. That was when I had a look at the credits and found that Nolan did not write this and he was just a director on this. Apart from Pacino, no one leaves a mark including Nolan. Robin Williams, after Good Will Hunting is particularly unconvincing (at least to me) in the role of a lousy writer while Hillary Swank was not needed and was never defined what she was supposed to do. Dialogue was never one of Nolan's characteristic abilities, which was painfully evident with this film, as we never root for any of the lead characters. By the time of its denouement we no longer care what happens to anyone in the film. It is a pity that the Nolan-Pacino combination ended in something like this which is kind of fitting, since they were never masters in each other's genre. If not for Pacino and breathtaking cinematography which pops in rather inadvertently, this movie would be unable to sit through.",Insomnia

Remakes are made for the worst reasons possible (usually just for more money, or as a vehicle for cast or crew).There was absolutely no reason for this film to have been made. I give it 3 points because at least most of the original script is somewhat respected, though it is badly raped in the end (in order to make it more Hollywood, more acknowledging the universe as black and white rather than subtly shaded). Don't waste your time.Show proper respect to Erik Skjoldbjærg by watching his original production (which is technically tighter, smoother, has more intimacy and remoteness, better acting, more dynamics, tensions, and of course a story in principle superior).",Insomnia

The performances are all fine, but the plot just isn't that captivating. I'm not sure what Hillary Swank and Robin Williams, two actors I usually enjoy, saw in their respectively roles that enticed them to do the movie. I realize that the movie is supposed to be more about Pacino's character's inner struggles than solving the central crime, but for a police drama, I still need an interesting crime, an interesting investigation, a few interesting twists and turns, etc., to hold my attention; and this movie lost its grip on me long before the close.",Insomnia

Pacino plays so well that hard-boiled detective.Pacino kills his partner in a weird persecution,i have to say that gives to the film a great line,the killer knows something,the cop knows something.And Williams plays a nervous killer,in the beginning when Pacino and Williams meet,he looks confident,but he is not,he is scared and that is what gives good suspense to this film.Honestly i expected a twist,common in Nolan Films (Memento,Inception,etc)If you like crime,detectives,noir films,you must watch Insomnia.",Insomnia
468,SmoothCriminal8291958,Taut detective thriller,8,13 May 2007,"Director Christopher Nolan made a sensational splash with the indie hit ""Memento"", earning him this shot at the big time. For the most part, he proved himself up to the task. ""Insomnia"" provides a multi-layered psychological thriller where two distinct story lines are interwoven in the character of Will Dormer (Al Pacino). The workup is a bit contrived, with Dormer coming to Alaska from LA to help out an old buddy with a murder investigation as he is himself being investigated by internal affairs. This serves as a foundation for the two story lines. The first is the animosity that develops between Dormer and his partner, who wants to cut a deal with internal affairs. The second, of course, is the murder investigation. After Dormer accidentally (?) shoots his partner while chasing the suspect in dense fog, the psychological games begin. Local detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), who is fawning all over Dormer and has read all his books on detective work, begins to suspect that her hero may have feet of clay.The psychodrama becomes intense as Dormer is confronted with communications from his killer nemesis Walter Finch (Robin Williams), while suspicions swirl around the death of his partner. Add to this his inability to get any sleep in Alaska's perpetual daylight and you have a man driven to the absolute brink.Nolan does an excellent job of shooting this film and the editing intensifies the psychological tension. The cinematography is also superb, aided by the majestic Alaskan and British Columbian locations. While the interaction between Dormer and Finch is unlikely, the symbiotic relationship that develops is fascinating and Nolan squeezes every psychological tingle that can be wrung from it.Pacino is masterful as the insomniac cop who has made certain ethical compromises in his career in the name of justice. He looks so terrible that he must have been purposely depriving himself of sleep to increase the realism of the character. Pacino gives Dormer (an interesting play on the Latin dormire, ""to sleep"", a dormer is the window of a sleeping room) a hard edge that gradually erodes as he becomes more sleep deprived, blurring the distinction between good and evil.Robin Williams seems to be trying to shed his nice guy image with back to back wackos. He follows up his sociopathic performance in ""One Hour Photo"" with this character who is a sort of sinister pragmatist. Williams is at his best when he is pushing sanity's limits, whether that be in zany comedy or maniacal mayhem, which is precisely why he was wrong for this part. This character is far too calculating and controlled for Williams talents and the part is also much too physical for him. He is just not convincing as a cold blooded killer and tough guy. That is not to say it was a bad performance, just the wrong actor. Hilary Swank unfortunately doesn't have much to do in a film that is dominated by Pacino and Williams.This is an excellent big budget debut for Nolan and another terrific performance by Pacino. The suspense and pace are first rate and despite the contrivances, it delivers. I rated it an 8/10. Definitely not a snoozer.",Insomnia
469,slhaas,Great directing... great acting... good movie.,8,31 May 2002,"I wouldn't rate this as the best movie of the year, or even Mr. Nolan's masterpiece to date.  I read a review on this board that gave this movie a 10/10, but I just can't go that far.  Most of my reluctance to call this such a great movie comes from the fact that Christopher Nolan didn't write it.  He is such a talent as a director and a writer, that when they come together it's a beautiful thing.  This is a remake of a 1997 movie, so you can only expect so much from it.  I knew this going into the movie, but many people didn't, and they expected the excitement level of Memento, where Nolan was able to write in so many twists & turns.  This movie just doesn't have that level of involvement, but don't get me wrong... it's a great movie.  Al Pacino gave a magnificent performance, as did Robin Williams in an uncommon role.  I like seeing him when he isn't the funny guy, so it was what I expected from him.  I thought the little audio & visual clues that Nolan drops into the movie ever so subtly is one of the best parts of this film.  It isn't so blatantly obvious that when you see the foreshadowing you pick up on it and know it's something you should remember, just not why, and it isn't so hidden that it takes you knowing about it to find it or look out for it.  It's one of his many skills as a director that I've noticed in his previous works, and look forward to in his future projects.  This movie was done when Memento took off, so I'm hoping for something great to come soon. This movie is well worth the watch, and I'll see it again, but don't go into it expecting it to be Memento 2 or you will leave bored & disappointed.",Insomnia

474,ford_fairlane,"I think a lot of people just didn't ""get"" this movie...",9,26 October 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Insomnia is a masterful work of metaphorical art.  I think many of the reviewers that have posted on this movie have failed to see the deeper meanings in this movie.  Many others on here have given the blow-by-blow on this picture, so I won't add that.  I will, however, point out some plot details that seem to have been over-looked by many people.**SPOILER ALERT**-Pacino's insomnia is not being caused by the never ending daylight. Hilary Swank's character says, ""good cops can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing, and bad cops can't sleep because of the guilt"".  In Pacino's case, you don't know which one it really is.  He is a good cop in that he always has the right intentions, even when he does wrong things.  But he's also a bad cop by some of his ""questionable"" police work (planting evidence, lying about shooting his partner).  The light is a metaphor for all of this, he feels as if he's under a spotlight, so to speak, because even he doesn't know if he's good or bad anymore.  This really comes focus when the Innkeeper comes into his room as he's try to block out the light.  She says, ""it is dark in here"", and then turns on the lights in a blinding effect. The room had been suitably dark all along, it was his conscience keeping him awake.  This certainly wasn't a plot hole and, infact, was one of the strong points of the movie.-The ending of the movie was excellent in my opinion.  Not only did it focus on the ambiguities of the two main characters, but it also showed how William's character was just a slightly darker ""shade of grey"" in comparison to Pacino's.  Deep down William's character was an evil man, despite doing some good things.  Pacino, on the other hand, turned out to be good when his life was on the line, despite some of his past misgivings.  He steered Swank's character in the right direction, even though she was more than willing to protect his legacy.-In the end, the flawed people died.  Having not seen the original, I can't compare the two, but I thought it was fitting.  Pacino essentially 'saved' Swank by directing her to do the right thing in the end, clearing his conscience as he was dying.  He knew that if she were to lose the bullet casing, she would end up to be just as doomed as he found himself to be.In all, great acting, a superior script (contrary to unpopular belief), and perfect symbolism make this a very good movie.  If you're a person who needs everything spelled out for them, then don't even bother.  If, however, you can read between the lines and catch the underlying themes in this movie, it's a must see.9/10  A very, very rare score from me.",Insomnia

While Pacino was...well...Pacino, I thought the rest of the cast was excellent.  The direction was well-done - the scenery was stunning, moods were captured perfectly, etc.  My problem is the story line.  I thought it was old and cliched, and I haven't even seen the original movie. It was very predictable.Maybe my problem is that my expectations were too high...I saw the previews: Christopher Nolan - excellent; Pacino, Williams, Swank - great; Alaska - great;  the pieces seemed to be there to go above and beyond Memento and Following.  I felt that the pieces were not put together - mostly, but not fully.It's very much the same feeling I had after seeing ""Unbreakable"" because of the high hopes I had since seeing ""The Sixth Sense.""

And although Swank's role is less involved, her performance is also noteworthy.Speaking of the cinematography, it is truly a work of art.

477,gunmogun,Welcome The Young Hitchcock,10,1 August 2002,"There are movies, many kinds of movies, as the art of movie making evolves many genres have evolved and these many genres in their wake have left behind precious treasures.Popular genre and unpopular genres populate the film landscape:  one among them literally invented by Alfred Hitchcock was the `Noir'.Let us study the meaning of Noir; a search on the web would give you the following meanings.· A genre of crime literature featuring tough, cynical characters and bleak settings. · Suggestive of danger or violence.Insomnia, Directed by Christopher Nolan, is true to the above meaning, The movie is based on a movie called the Insomnia, written by a two Norwegians, Nikolaj Frobenius and Erik Skjoldbjaerg, The first insomnia is a Norwegian film directed Erik Skjoldbjaerg,A super cop and his partner arrive in Alaska from L.A. to assist the police there to solve the murder of a 17 year old girl, an investigation into the super cops past is suggested and a strange rift is established between the cops that arrive from L.A. the body leads to the killer the killer is trapped and while in pursuit within the Alaskan fog the super cop shoots at killer but kills the partner, the Killer is witness to this and begins to black mail the Super cop, It's a mistake but because of the investigation on his past practices the   super cop goes to  some lengths to cover up. Lengths like, a false report, routing the bullet to the murderer and a string of others.Set in the Alaskan brightness, The mood is bleak a constant cloud overhang and the light continuing thru the night, The story is simple we know the murder and the murderer almost immediately and there is not much intrigue there. Infect there is no intrigue at all, but in abundance is the talent of the director, the talent of the actors and the handling of their respective talents. There are some directors like Sam Mendes who succor on the color of his characters and let them lead the mood and there are some that succor on the plot and lets the plot dictate the mood. The later is definably Hitchcock and in this our times it is another Britain, Chris Nolan. This above arguments supportive display is Insomnia.The super cop, Detective Will Dormer' is Al Pacino and the murderer is Walter Finch' Robin Williams, the detective Ellie Burr' is Hilary Swank assists and adores Dormers work, Ellie burr character carries a streak of non-ironic in the filed of cynical characters, like a bright flower in a barren farm. One claims the other and highlights other.  -I had consciously excluded her from the plot synopsis because her character is constructed within the story like eyes within the human body, She is present in a vital character but not significant to the vacant obvious plot, By way of revealing the story thru the bright flower the rather dark story has a shadow of brightness to it. The afore mentioned plot is just the infrastructure a Chess board, a rich, dark yet an amazing mood within which minds of the characters move, where the plot and the mood do the tango.The Plot is obvious the movement of the characters is obvious and so why did I drag my wife to the movie for my second and her first? Good Movies are like cherished moments, like those photographs that are tucked in those album jackets and extract emotion or related emotions from you very now and then. Like those Hitchcock's in your library. They are revisited again and again, probably for a scene or a string of them. This is a Movie that has no intrigue that draws the audience but draws you in for its directorial genius that ties in tough cynical characters in a bleak setting with a suggestion of danger.So is it wrong to place it among the other Film Noir?",Insomnia

This film is actually a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film starring Stellen Skarsgard. Where has I haven't seen that version, I doubt it could top the performances & mood that this film gave us. I don't want to give to much away, so I will just give u some thoughts on the films main lead, Al Pacino. Pacino has become one of those actors like Jack Nicholson, it just feels like there rehashing the same old act. For Pacino, the manic & loud type. In this film he looks worn down & seemingly on the edge of crumbling.

This is a straightforward story that, while not neccessarily predictable, doesn't rely on pulling a 180 on the audience. Al Pacino does his usual tough guy thing, with the twist being that he doesn't get to sleep during the six days over which this movie occurs. Robin Williams is spectacular.

(Admit it folks, this ain't Godfather, Scarface, Dog Day Afternoon quality, more Heat, Sea of Love quality huh) I thought the supporting cast was excellent. Robin Williams ability to interject passion in a role of a low keyed psychopath amazed me, he is truly an underrated actor. The neophyte detective also performed admirably. One of the previous reviewers referred to Al Pacino's character as a ""true American Patriot"" How sick is that!  His character was almost as disgusting as Robin Williams character. Here is a decorated police officer who plants evidence, murders a innocent man and conspires with a child molester / murderer. What a patriot. Integrity is an important part of patriotism.

487,diesel_do_nicely,A real thriller that owes as much to location as to story,8,16 September 2002,"The opening of this movie is typically filmic bordering on cliched, with a panning shot over Alaskan scenery of the two LA cops in a small sea-plane. However, this should not cloud your judgement on what is otherwise an excellent concoction of blinding imageary and genuine suspense.Al Pacino takes to his character like a duck to water. During the scenes in which he is desperately trying to sleep you really do feel his sense of frustration, despair and fear; also helped by the way the camera is overexposed to the bright light penetrating through every crevice. However it is Williams who really steals the film with one of his best performances ever.One of the most extraordinary things about this films is the way Williams mananges to play a clearly very evil and distorted psycopath, yet manages the get sympathy from the audince. This isn't just the typical ""lovable rogue"" Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid style performance; it is much deeper and unfathomable than even the empathy one feels for Hannibal Lector.Overall this movie is an excellent thriller that owes as much to its beautiful scenery and terrific filmic devices than it does to its script and acting.

Once again thank you, good night abs never forgotten P.s. Long May Christopher continue! A cinematic master",Insomnia
492,Tiler,A murder mystery brimming with talent.,9,24 May 2002,"No spoilers here.  Insomnia has everything you expect and something you've always wanted.  Pacino is at the top of his game although definitely in his niche as a homicide detective.  Robin Williams brings a haunting craziness to the screen so that you realize we've been missing out by not having Robin Williams cast as the heavy more often.  Hillary Swank is almost out of her league, but hangs in there to perfectly compliment an all Oscar-winning front line.  Kudos to Nicky Katt for not staying on the porch on this one. It's his best role since Waking Life!  Even Maura Tierney gets an honorable mention.Given the intense editing and directing, you'll be able to forgive the nearly predictable ending.  Good Job, one and all!",Insomnia
493,Prav,Insomnia would have been helpful to stay awake,4,3 May 2002,"You would think that 3 Academy Award winners would boost the quality of this movie.  Think again.The pace of the movie was plodding, almost as if you were sleepwalking through it.  Now, it may have been totally on purpose, but I was extremely restless, waiting for something (anything!) to happen.  If the movie wanted to convey the feeling of disorientation etc associated with sleep deprivation (and suffered by Al Pacino's character), by God, they managed to do it quite well.I guess I got my money's worth:  I went to a free screening so paid nothing. I would recommend you see this movie only when it shows up on cable (save your money!) and only if you were suffering from Insomnia (guaranteed cure!).",Insomnia
494,ianmham,SPOILERS SPOIERS SPOILERS Don't read if you haven'...,10,26 May 2002,"SPOILERS SPOIERS SPOILERS Don't read if you haven't > seen it yet.Some viewers seem to be missing the point of this movie. The central conflict is NOT Pacino vs. Williams and the girl's murder. We know Finch did it. It's in the trailer. Finch admits it. The conflict is Pacino's life, the choices he has made in the past and how it all catches up with him.Pacino's a semi-crooked cop. He wants to play by the rules, but he can't. It's too tough to get convictions. So he manipulates evidence the ultimate no-no for a detective. He tells us of one instance in the past  the one he's being investigated for but how many more may he be hiding? After all, he's doing the same thing with Finch. Trying to plant the gun and distort the facts so that Finch will get caught, because he knows Finch did it, and there's not enough real evidence. But Finch is trying to frame the kid, with Pacino's complicity it's all beautifully complex and agonizing for all the central characters.A fascinating cat and mouse game with everybody having everything to lose. So in the end, when Pacino whispers to Swank ""Don't lose your way"" (I believe this is what he says, it's hard to hear), he's atoning for his past sins. He doesn't want her to fall into the same trap his life has become. It's destroyed his life, his morals, and his mind.The movie is a psychological portrait of a tortured soul, and Pacino probably deserves an Oscar for how brilliantly he draws us into his conflicted state, much of the time just with the expressions on his face. Williams too, for conning us into feeling sorry for him initially it was an accident, just like you, Will  and then showing us the depraved sicko he really is, first in glimpses, then in a climax of desperate violence.And Swank  what an awful turnabout she has to endure. Her hero has fallen to the level of scumbag. What does she do? Squeal on a fellow cop? Keep his secrets?The success of this movie is the moods, the suspense, the torturous plot twists, the way Nolan captures the imprisonment of Pacino's insomniac state and uses it as a metaphor for his ""awakening"" to the living hell his life has become. It's a 10 on everybody's part.",Insomnia
495,mevap,One word: predictable.,2,7 June 2002,"Thought the movie was boring and predictable.

497,xczsun,Vivid,10,8 February 2003,"SpoilerAl Pacino plays Will Dormer, a detective under investigation for planting evidence in a child murder case. He and his partner,the prosecutions star witness, go to Alaska to investigate another child murder. They get into a shootout with the killer and Dormer accidentially kills his partner in a crossfire. It was honestly an accident but to internal affairs it would seem like murder so he tampers with the bullets and makes it look like the killer did it. The police believe his story at first but start to grow suspicious. The killer then makes contact with Dormer and lets him know he knows his secret and starts toying with him. So there Dormer is, stuck in the middle of two major investigations where he's constantly being questioned about the shooting of his partner and there's this killer messing with him. To top it off he can't deal with the 24 hour daylight of Alaska and gets insomnia so he's confused and delusional half the time. Exellent movie. The acting is all believable. The chemistry between Pacino and Williams is intense. Beautifully filmed. Good location. Much better then the sloppy Pledge. Superb direction from Christopher Nolan. He's proven he's the best of the new directors. 4 out of 4 stars. One of the best of 2002.",Insomnia
498,ilovehotmales,This a'int no Memento,6,16 May 2002,"I saw ""Insomnia"" in a sneak preview and was expecting a freaky movie. Instead I got an ethical debate about murder and conscience. I would have enjoyed the movie if there were more insomnia-like effects on par with the short term memory-loss in ""Memento"". Al Pacino gets agitated and confused, but you do not really feel like he is losing his mind. Robin Williams is the villain, but he could have been a lot nastier. The plot also falls apart when you hear the explanations and the motives, although it would have been cooler backwards. It really feels like a really long ""Law & Order"" episode.",Insomnia
499,jasongraham,Put me to sleep,6,13 November 2002,"The script defies convention by revealing the killer early on, the cast and director makes for a stellar line-up, yet this film doesn't hit the heights it should. The tension is slack, Nolan opting for a morality film which might have worked well if the issues were more fully explored. It remains an enjoyable film, however Nolan's direction does the cast and script a slight disservice.The performances of Swank, Pacino, and Williams are consistently good. However there is a lack of chemistry within each relationship in this film, in stark contrast to Memento. The LA investigation is touched on in a rather light fashion for a plot device on which the ethical dilemmas of the film come to hinge.The two murders committed in the film are not given equal moral complexity, which might cloud the judgement of the viewer. It is clear all along that Nolan is placing the audience on the conventional side of the moral equation.Despite these flaws, Pacino shines as the decorated cop whose years in the job have eroded his moral fibre. I'd like to see the original Norwegian version [with subtitles of course!] to examine the film from a different director's perspective.",Insomnia
500,thedifference77,High hopes for this film,1,4 December 2002,"I had high hopes for this movie.  Unfortunately, this movie was a dreadful experience.  Christopher Nolan, the director of Memento, does a good enough job with the material.  However, the material isn't good at all.  Same old repeated cop story throughout history, the good cop with a tainted past who had to bend the rules at some point to get a guy he knew was guilty.  If you enjoy cliche ridden characters, i guess this movie is for you.  If you're looking for originality, unfortunately, keep looking.",Insomnia
501,trumanlevi,"a worthy effort, but some formulaic styles",8,4 May 2002,"I was privileged to see 'Insomnia' on May 1st, 2002 at an advance screening on my campus.  I am a film student and have been eagerly awaiting any new releases by Christopher Nolan after watching 'Memento.'  I particularly liked Nolan's innovative style that is seen all throughout 'Memento.' Unfortunately his innovation takes a vacation for much of 'Insomnia' as it becomes a stereotypical murder mystery and even a bit of a horror towards the end.  Al Pacino has enough screen presence to be 80% of the film and still carry it well.  Robin Williams and Hillary Swank put in roles that were nothing near the limits of their acting abilities.  The plot had enough twists in it (amidst some weak dialogue) to make this an enjoyable film. This is one of the most enjoyable murder mysteries I have yet seen, but this became a very Hollywood style movie with less innovation then I expected from Christopher Nolan. All around, I give this 3 stars out of 4.  Not a must see film, but recommended if you like murder mysteries or Al Pacino.",Insomnia
502,dervish-,Not Memento but Intriguing Nevertheless,8,19 June 2002,"Not 'Memento', but extremely well made, nevertheless.  Al Pacino is perfectly cast in this role.  The entire cast is exceptional in fact. Hillary Swank gives a wonderful performance as a keen cop in Alaska, as does Robin Williams, in a creepier than usual role.I was a bit apprehensive to see this film after viewing the trailer.  I thought the trailer gave away too much.  But the story isn't one of those that keeps you guessing ""who done it"", but rather ""how are they gonna get out of it"".  Nolan keeps you on your seat, and by the end of the movie, you are in fact physically tired - feeling the very insomnia that gives inspiration to the films name.",Insomnia
503,liana-13,Movie goes down unexpected twists,8,25 May 2002,"While it's hard to comment on a movie without totally ruining the surprize, I will say that Insomnia is a well done mystery film. Perhaps it doesn't pack the same amount of surprize and thrill that LA Confidential does, but it unravels the mystery with finess. I can't think of many movies where the protagonist goes into a contract with the enemy, without having the movie sink because of sheer corniness or camp, but Insomnia manages to avoid both traps, while keeping you in suspense. A good way to spend two hours, as the story keeps you enmeshed.",Insomnia

I realize the film is about a guy with insomnia, but they still could've shown more of what happened to Rachel Clement.

Robin Williams and Al Pacino played their roles perfectly, however, the story left me wanting, wondering If and hoping there was some kind of moral.  The final twist I was waiting for never seemed to come, either.  I own Following and Memento (Nolan's other films), but just cannot say I enjoyed this movie.  This film IS the CURE for INSOMNIA.",Insomnia

Stumbling out of the theater, my mind was ablaze with creepy weird full moon thoughts.  However, after sleeping on my grumpy opinions for a night, I realize that the movie was not unlike many Viking football teams of the last 15 years.

I am far too lazy to write a coherent, well organized, persuasive  professor ""A"" approved review---    I can only offer vague tired freestyle......The movie was kinda lame style over substance hollywoodishI wrote a bunch more, but then I deleted it.

507,Demon1128,The #1 cure for insomnia of the summer,4,29 May 2002,"I cant wait for the DVD of this movie.  When I find that I cannot stand a movie that others RAVE about, watching the DVD and listening to the commentary sometimes helps.  This one needs it.Having not seen the original version, I may have had undue expectations.  I expected a film featuring Al Pacino as a weary cop being stretched beyond his mental and physical limits by Robin Williams' cunning, manipulative and murderous villain, whose psychological game forces Pacino to pursue his quarry without the benefit of rest.OOPS. My bad. The film proves to be far more simple than that.The Alaskan backdrop is the most compelling and stunning aspect of this film, and is truly great cinematography.  Unfortunately, it does not carry a film who's pacing never builds and never peaks.  With no opening hook, no mystery to solve and no tension of any kind, Insomnia plods along, staggering through a dull haze reminiscent of genuine lack-of-sleep.While Pacino, Williams and Hillary Swank work with the material they are provided, none of the characters are given enough to pull you in.  Oh if they had more to work with... Pacino's descent could have been fascinating, Williams could have been truly chilling, and Swank could have been, well... probably the same.In the end, Insomnia should be taken with a glass of water, 30 minutes before bedtime. Don't drive and don't operate any heavy machinery.See you in the morning.",Insomnia
508,cutie_nicole_69,Decent,7,9 June 2002,"This film was pretty decent. I know Pacino can do a much better job, it didn't seem like he was trying. And what was up with his fingernails? The supporting cast did a great job, Nicky Katt, Paul Dooley, and Maura Tierney.(although I don't know why she ended up asleep on Pacino's bed.) Swank and Williams did a good job as well, both of them believable. I did not, however, like the way the film was cut. Always flashing back to scenes that don't make sense untill the very end. That really took me away from the film. I constantly found myself turning to a friend asking, ""what the heck was that?"" Overall, go see the film at a matinee, it is only worth five bucks.",Insomnia
509,jasklo,Snooze Alert Warning,1,1 June 2002,"I can't understand the applause for this terribly boring and under developed story. After Memento I expected a interactive, thought provoking movie, what I got was a definite disapointment. The name Al Pacino invokes memories of some of the greatest movies of all time (Godfather,Scarface,Heat,to name a few) this will not be mentioned in the same breath as those. Having 3 oscar winning actors in the film is wonderful accomplishment, but it does not make it a Oscar caliber movie. Swank's performance was uninspired and contrived, Pacino's performance almost let me catch some ZZZZ's, Williams as a murderer, ewww terribly frightening,not really. I wish people would not be mesmerized by Pacino, but the fear of criticizing a legend overwhelms most, not me, I dont blame him although it appears he sleepwalks (pun intended) through his scenes, the story is weak, dull, and woefully spotty. If you want to waste your 9$ go see it, if not spend 3$ and rent ""The Usual Suspects"".",Insomnia
510,StrangeloveRedemption,Not for the faint of heart,6,5 June 2002,"I was kind by giving this movie a 6.  The ending was horrible and Pacino was more overblown than he's ever been (yes even more than ...And Justice for All).  Williams still had to make his wisecracks to flaw his serious role. What did Nolan sign on for???  Yeah, he can't do Memento every time...but at least after Pi, Aranofsky followed up with Requiem for a Dream.  Anyway, it was somewhat entertaining and one of the better movies of this year (Pray for a good fall season of movies...if Insomnia is the best, expect the year 2000 all over again for movies)",Insomnia

Christopher Nolan has quickly and clearly established himself as a great filmmaker with another great story and an even better film.  The film is remarkable for its storytelling and characters, and not to mention its independent flair, which is rare and admirable these days.  Pacino, Williams, and Swank deliver the goods in this fresh and dramatic thriller.  Did I mention the acting was absolutely wonderful?  Well it was.  Did I mention that the directing was top-notch? Well it was.  Someone once said this would be a good David Fincher film, they couldn't have been more wrong...Nolan's style is far more developed (latent imagery with a certain degree of ambiguity) and does not rely on the MTV style camera and editing effects to make his stories mysterious and intriguing, his blatant manipulations of the audience's knowledge and perspective is far more effective.  I recommend this film to anyone in the mood for a mindbending, deep journey into the human psyche.  This is what great filmmaking is all about.",Insomnia

Way too much dialogue...,8,8 June 2002,"This movie was good, but I don't really see a smart L.A. cop conversing this much with a suspected murderer...even though Pacino was in a tight spot, he wouldn't be stupid enough to be recorded incriminating himself.  Maybe it was the insomnia that got to him?  Nah.",Insomnia

It had its boring parts, but overall it held my attention.  I loved Al Pachino's part, and have always thought of him as a good actor. This movie did not change my overall image of him at all. It entertained me and kept my attention throughout it till the end. I also loved Pachino's last line in the movie(if anybody cares, i just thought to mention it ;). I think this may have been the first movie that made me want to sleep!",Insomnia
514,HungGirlieGirl,Why?,5,2 November 2002,"I'm absolutely mortified that the remake of Insomnia has a higher rating than the original.  What the hell is that about?  Perhaps the majority of people that saw the big money remake didn't get to see the original.  I'm hoping that's what it is because that's the saddest thing that I've seen on IMDb.The original is so damn near perfect the way it is.  The only reason I gave it 9 out of 10 was because I had a little bit of a hard time putting together part of the story the first time out.  But the acting was wonderful and the location itself gave you all the tension you needed.  This colorless place with the sun shining eternally - it was perfect.  The remake is not half as good in my opinion.  Maybe that's because I have something to compare it to, but either way there are some things that you just can't redo in 'american' that have already been done in foreign countries.  It just doesn't give you the same bang.  This is one of them.  Plus, being stuck with Al Pacino, cringing every time he comes on wondering if he's going to start overacting like in 'Heat' was just way too much trauma for me.  He stayed more understated than I expected but he's playing a character that the kind of understatement played - perfectly, so why the hell do it again?
I don't know.  Maybe I'm just too biased, but I still say if you're going to sit downa and watch this one, get the 1997 original, not Nolan's remake.",Insomnia

I didn't know that before seeing this movie. Later, I found out. I haven't seen that Insomnia(which released in 1997). I don't know how that movie was, or to which extent it is been improvised in this Insomnia. I watched this movie because of the legendary director 'Christopher Nolan'(we all know who he is, what he is).Al Pacino....did a good job...so do all other actors. In fact this movie rolls down in a different pattern. I liked screenplay of this movie. Watch this movie for it's freshness, it's a bit confusing at times, but you will certainly cherish this movie. It's a one time watch....not quite up to the mark with Nolan's other flicks.

However, what I didn't expect was how the movie got it's title. Al Pacino cannot get a wink of shut eye because all of the guilt on his mind for his past malicious detective practices.Then, while investigating a teenage murder, he shoots at his partner by accident and kills him.To protect himself he hides the murder weapon to keep the truth from being found out.Only it is Robin Williams character (the one who kills the teenager) who sees what he has done, and proposes that they help each other out so nobody gets in trouble.Pacino must deal with his morals - will he give himself up and tell the truth thus bringing down himself and Williams? Or will he repeat himself and keep the truth bottled inside him and never have a good nights sleep as his conscience will always be talking to him.A must see, especially if you follow Williams or Pacino's careers.",Insomnia
517,charlie-mcgeachie,Well Made Thriller,10,23 April 2014,"I think overall Insomnia was a well made film. It had a great cast, Al Pacino was great and Robin Williams was outstanding as the villain. The cinematography by Wally Pfister was gorgeous and the directing was sublime. Throughout the movie there was always a dark tone even though the actual town that it was set was always in daytime. David Julyan's score gives an operatic sense to the film which in addition to great acting and low key lighting creates a dark feel to the film. I think in my opinion Robin Williams should have at least been nominated for the best supporting actor Oscar. Overall Christopher Nolan has made a dark, gripping movie with a great cast and beautiful Cinematography.9/10",Insomnia

Though the movie starts off slow with the murder investigation from LA special cops, it picks up a small pace later. This is not a murder mystery so it is not so nail biting or edge of the seat drama. What I found intriguing was to fit in the three characters played by the wonderful actors namely Al Pacino, Robbin Williams and Hillary Swank. At the end the movie concludes with the usual drama of good guy and bad guy demarcation, I wonder if the author really intended to end the movie this way, it is subtly titled Insomnia. Director is Christopher Nolan (Memento fame) - not really required to accredit to this but couldn't hurt either. The story says it all.",Insomnia

It depicts the character of Al Pacino as an insomniac detective,Robin Williams as a manipulative writer and Hilary as a young detective.The character development of Robin's character was not so strong,which is the main downside of the movie.

SWANK may have been good in BOYS DON'T CRY, but not in this one.  I have no idea what people are talking about when they refer to her a ""great"" actress.  Lest we forget that before BOYS she was best known for her stunning performance in THE NEXT KARATE KID!  As far as WILLIAMS is concerned, I really wasn't that impressed.  I'm thinking that this role wasn't for him, or was that the role wasn't worthy of him.  I can never remember these things.  I know what you're thinking.  But what about the story?  I don't know where I've seen it before, but I know I have.  And that, my friends, is a BIG a problem.

In this movie he is again able to put the viewer in the state of mind of Pacino's character though various cinematic devices just as he did his previous movie Memento. The pacing is excellent and Nolan gives the viewer a sense of the locale without having the breathtaking Alaskan scenery distract the viewer from the plot.The characters are REAL people, not stereotypes, that is as much owed to the actors as to Mr. Nolan. It's clear that Christopher Nolan is a COMPLETE film maker something that has been so elusive in Hollywood's recent past.

The most important part of a movie the 1st time u watch it is, was it entertaining...Thats what movies are suppose to do.

527,mds69,Not as good as the original,1,8 May 2002,"This remake of the 1997 Norwegian film by the same title is something of a disappointment, not because it is worse than the original (which it is), but because Christopher Nolan, the director, is hot off of his brilliant film Memento.  As unconventional as that film was, that is how conventional his Insomnia is.  This is due mainly to the important ways in which Al Pacino's character Agent Dormer (why didn't they just call him Agent ""Sleeper,"" hmm?) has been softened up from the original character, played by Stellan Skarsgård.  If you've seen both films, you'll know which scenes I am thinking about.  Maybe these changes are due to American audiences' sentiment that their heroes be unambiguously good, without a dark side.  Or, maybe Al Pacino's ego required that the character be more heroic.  In any case, the character has lost any trace of originality, which was really the only saving grace of the original film.  Why and how this film came to be remade in such an uninspired fashion is beyond me.  It is my hope that Christopher Nolan's next film shows a bit more spark than this one.",Insomnia

This is the kind of movie that unfolds before the viewer. To mention any material aspect of the movie in the review will spoil the movie for the viewer. This is a classic crime drama with imperfect people on both sides of the law. Acting is top notch and very believable. The movie takes place in Alaska, during the Summer where Alaska earns the nickname Land of the Midnight Sun.

I gave it an 8 overall. An 8 is very good to me. Few movies ever get passed a 7. The story was likeable and the characters played almost flawless roles. The scenery in Alaska especially made it a brilliant movie to watch. I love how Christopher Nolan seems like he researchers a lot of background information for his movies. It is apparent here how he takes Alaskan life into account when making the movie. THIS ISN'T EXACTLY A SPOILER BUT YOU STILL MAY NOT WANT TO READ THIS:..... I thought that this movie did what Training Day couldn't. It took a cop who was good and made him actually believe that he was no better than the killer. Excellent job by Robin Williams in making him believe this.,Insomnia
530,sumdeus,Excellent Thriller...Excellent Cast...Excellent Director,10,16 May 2002,"I was privileged to see an advanced screening of ""Insomnia"" at my state university two weeks ago.  Here's my account of a very well done movie:Christopher Nolan had a heavy task in following up ""Memento.""  This movie could have easily been a made-for-TV-type flick, but with a perfect cast, spectacular directing, and awe-inspiring cinematography this is a top-notch movie thriller.It isn't ""Silence of the Lambs,"" although Robin Williams' character seems to have a Hannibal Lecter-ish way to his mannerisms.  This isn't ""Memento"" by a long shot, which was both disappointing and gratifying at the same time.  I have seen two Nolan movies (""Following"" and ""Memento"" both of which I recommend) and both shared the odd filming technique of not running in sequence, so it was good to see that he could make a movie that follows in logical order and pull it off in a big way.Hilary Swank played a rather small role, one that probably could have been omitted with a few script changes.  I won't say anything about the end of the movie other than it was the ONLY downfall of the movie.  I am so used to Nolan having some GIANT twist at the end, so when there wasn't I was a little disappointed.  The action scenes are very intense in subtle ways.  I still am impressed that a script with so few twists ended up being as good as it did.I gave it a 9 out of 10, but I think most people will settle for a solid 8. Definitely check it out and you shouldn't be disappointed.",Insomnia
531,nastynakednathan,What a comeback for Robin Williams!,10,2 May 2002,"Robin Williams really impresses...and in a role unlike we've ever seen him! I was flabbergasted to see him take on this type of persona, but it is definitely worthy of attention!  Congratulations, Robin, for a job well done!",Insomnia
532,eaRWaxedI3oarder,Pacino is the heart&soul,8,16 July 2002,"Great direction from Nolan's 3rd crack at the movies. Better direction then in Memento, but the plot wasn't as interesting as memento nor was as it compared to following.Pacino gives the performance which keeps the movie going. Great acting from him puts the heart&soul of the movie which lacked the DARKER side of Williams. Sure Williams was a bad guy, but he wasn't as bad as we expected. Myself anyways. Don't get me wrong, Williams is a fine actor, very fine indeed. Although, he wasn't what made the movie what it is.8/10",Insomnia
533,davo_75,You wont lose any sleep over this one!,5,24 May 2002,"I guess that if you cast two of Hollywood's biggest stars, both oscar winners, in the same movie and assign Robin Williams the role of the bad guy, you can get away with more than if you were to cast two unknowns. Insomnia is beautifully filmed and the soundtrack is most appropriate. The storyline, however is weak, weak, weak!! There is NO SUSPENSE, no typical moments where you jump off your seat in surprise. Nothing! Pacino is - Good, not great! Robin Williams, whom I love in both comedic and dramatic roles, is not suitable or believable in this role at all.I guess you COULD go and see it but you would be better off saving your 10 bucks and seeing it on video/Dvd/Network premier etc etc etc.",Insomnia
534,pennis4311,better than the original,8,25 May 2002,"I am really sad to say it but it was better than the original.  The original was long and boring.  So why did I like this one?  I have no idea but I am glad I decided to give this film another chance.  Nolan has made an Intense, insightful, and deliberate film that makes you WonDer.  I also want to point out that this is not a European film but an American film based on a previous European version.  There is a difference.",Insomnia
535,Nyor,Not a very good movie,3,26 May 2002,"If you suffer from insomnia be sure and see this one - -it will put you to sleep. It was a real letdown for me. I had expected from all the hype to see a tense or suspense filled drama, it was neither. It started to go downhill for me from the very first. That the L.A. police Dept. would send two of their best detectives to Alaska to help with a murder case that was totally unrelated to them or L.A. is not creditable. I feel that neither the director or screenwriter knows too much about actual police work as there were other things (e.g. running red lights and sirens blaring to serve a search warrant)that didn't make sense. Puchino & Swank did as well as could be expected with the material they had to work with. Robin William's character wasn't really believable. He didn't seem sinister at all, Just kind of well I'm here"".Chalk this one up as a summertime disappointment!",Insomnia
536,mikemsd,Trailers were decent.,1,28 May 2002,I enjoyed the trailers before this movie more than the movie itself. You can feel the effect of the insomnia by how tired from boredom you will be. Great movie if you want to take a nice long nap. Not much suspense or anything in the way of a plot twist. Very predictable overdone story.,Insomnia
537,mastadon75,"Lack of Character development, cleverness leaves Insomnia in the dark",5,28 May 2002,"I was expecting a little more out of this movie than what i got.  I expected a smart thriller which would keep me intrigued.  The protagonist (Al Pacino character) is a walking cliche', you really don't feel him the way you would feel a great Pacino character.  Pacino doesn't deliver in making us feel this guy.The Robin Williams character is very well played as the adversary, he does a great job in making the audience understand the nature of this sordid fellow.The supporting Cast puts in an unmomentous performance.  The Swank character should have been better handled, and her relationship with Pacino could have been better exploited, i didn't get much from the exchanges between this Oscar caliber duo.  Her metamorphosis from the ingenue detective left something to be desired, i really wanted to see more emotion and get a better grasp of this character and how it evolves from start to finish than what the film gave.Finally throughout the whole movie, the concentrated effort is on how the Pacino character will find a way out of the situation, and you expect that there will be some sort of clever way that the resolution is achieved, this is where the film really cheated us.  Instead it ended with a predictable overture and nothing to really think about as you get up to leave the theater except to ponder whether or not this really was the same directorial effort that produced 'Memento'. Ranks 5 out of 10.",Insomnia
538,mhaidarpour,Insomnia (1997) v.s. Insomnia (2002),6,30 May 2002,"First I watched Insomnia in theatre and I thought that it was great movie. Two days later I saw on TV Guide that Insomnia was on TV.  I searched IMDB and found out that the Insomnia (2002) is actually a remake of a Norwegian film by the same name Insomnia (1997).So I watched the movie on TV and I noticed that the plot was a somewhat altered.  One would assume that a remake would be a better with a budget of 50million and enormous star power, but that's not the case here.   I expected more from `Christopher Nolan, the creator of Memento'.I think the reason the remake is not as good is because they changed the characters to make Al Pacino and even Robin William (the bad guy) look better. They never wanted to make a better film; they wanted to manufacture a movie that would make millions and millions of dollars, like most of the movies that are made in the Hollywood today.The acting was okay and Christopher Nolan's directing of the movie was excellent, but overall I believe that the original Insomnia was much better.",Insomnia
539,grantmat,"Perfect timing, great potential, BUT...",8,3 September 2002,"I have not seen the 1997 original (which I intend on doing), but this film really stood out to me from the trailer alone as a film with a lot of potential.The idea of a cop on the tail of a murderer, in a town that has no darkness, unable to sleep - its a great concept. The pace of the film reflects the increasingly tired state of our hero, with some of the shining moments of the film being the things he sees while in this half conscious zombified state.What lets the film down is the rather typical female lead, being Hillary Swank in the role of the rookie cop, who gets to work with her idol - the officer she studied in the academy.So yeah, a rather 'done' female lead role, but also a boring ending. The first possibility for ending the film popped in to my mind about 3/4 of the way through... and it played out down to the last flutter of the eyelid. Not a BAD ending, but an expected one. Would have been good to see something that worked well, but wasn't so obvious.",Insomnia

542,karlientje33,Great movie,10,23 November 2002,"Insomnia is a brilliant work of beginning director Chris Nolan. Just like Memento this a beautiful piece of art. How he puts everything in the picture is just brilliant. It has been a long time since I've seen such a grey film. There is no clear difference between good and bad. It's a film that shows us how real life is; nobody 100% good, nobody's perfect. And he made a great choice of actors. You can never go wrong if you take the greatest actor of all, Al Pacino of course. He was made to play that role. Even though I had my doubts about the choice of Robin Williams in the beginning, it turned out pretty good. He did an excellent work. People, this is a must see movie!!!",Insomnia
543,the_odessy,Pacino/Williams good performance,8,1 June 2003,After watching Insomnia i thought both Pacino and Williams gave great performances.

I thought the movie had a good idea behind it.,Insomnia

546,mellick,Insomnia Review,7,20 July 2014,"I gotta tell you folks ,this is another one of those great movies Al Pacino takes part in. He plays a detective coming from L.A. who is famous for cracking robbery and murder cases. He gets assigned to a murder case in an Alaska town. While searching for the killer in the fog, he accidentally( some may say consciously watching the end parts). He lies about killing his partner and accuses the killer for the death of his partner. He questions himself very hard over this unusual event and finds it very difficult to sleep( eventually becomes insomniac after 3 days). Eventually he finds the killer but things get more and more complicated since the killer knows that Will Dormer killed Hap Eckhart. He blackmails Will and asks him to stop pursuing this case and leave him alone....Nicely developed scenario,fun to watch and nice amount of action. It's definitely a must watch movie.",Insomnia

It is well shot, well it was like a location scouting for TDKRs flight scene. The story even though not original, is brilliant. Will keep you hooked to the screen. Acting is brilliant considering Alpachino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank were playing the main characters. Especially Al. Now coming to negatives, I still believe that this is an average movie being a Nolanite myself. The story is predictable especially the ending (Was expecting a twist there). All in all a good movie with good story, great acting and very beautifully shot. So if you are looking to wind down this is the Nolan movie to go for.",Insomnia

549,armageddonkitten-136-903448,"Short review of Insomnia, no spoilers.",9,10 September 2011,"Excellent film, even though you know exactly what's going on. There is no actual mystery there. It is, however, still intensely suspenseful. All of the mysteries are internal ones. Questions of morality, guilt, suspicion, right and wrong, decisions that change everything. You never know who is going to jump what way... and how insomnia affects perception and judgment.There are good guys and bad guys, and it's easy to see the ones at the extremes, but in the murky half-light hide the grey hats, the ones you can't trust to be good or bad. So what do you do? There's where the suspense lies...And it is good.I was never TRULY a fan of Al Pacino's (maybe I just haven't watched Dog Day Afternoon all the way through) until this film. His craggy face lends itself to his role, and he is best when he is understated, pulled back, reined in. It's good.Who's the villain? Well, watch it and see...Cinematography in this film is almost another character unto itself. The camera plays tricks on you, leads you on, asks questions you have no answer for until the bitter end. The story is presented visually, exactly how it should be. You know from the first moments of the credits that Something Is Going On. Always nice to see someone use the intro as an integral part of the film instead of just a place to put names...",Insomnia
550,gabriel111198,Endless Possibility,7,4 September 2013,"I must say, that when I heard that Nolan had made a film starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams about a detective that gets no sleep, I was pretty damn excited to see it. Pacino was perfect for his role, and it was an interesting casting decision to make Williams a villain. The plot was good, but not spectacular, probably because it wasn't written by Nolan. What I must stress, however, is that this story had incredible potential and could have been Nolan's best movie if done correctly. The idea of getting no sleep is a very haunting concept, especially while hunting for a murderer. Nolan loves focusing on emotion and psychology, and honestly I didn't see a lot of that at all in this film. Sure, the good cop/bad cop aspect was interesting, but it was neither what I was expecting or what I honestly would have preferred. This was still an above-average film, but nowhere near as good as it could have been with a director, actors, and concept like this.",Insomnia
551,yassir26,The best-of of Al Pacino,10,27 December 2004,"I've just had the DVD this week end, and I couldn't help it, I saw the film at least 5 times... This is the best film I saw from Al, the film title Insomnia reflects exactly the state of the actor... Pacino leads an inquiry on a brutal death of a teenager, in a lost town in Alaska. while chasing the criminal(Williams), he accidentally kills his partner, and make of Williams the author of this accident... It's then the debut of a long insomnia in a country where the sun never sets... Natural landscapes of Alaska serve remarkably the story. However, it's difficult to talk about Insomnia without mentioning the psychological idea of intrigue. The movie deals mainly with one question: How to live with the sentiment of guilt? till when a lie can possess you? Nolan answers it with the parts related to sleep in the movie.I particularly loved the performance of Pacino in this movie, it was in one word amazing, during all the movie you could notice the fatigue on his face... he was like someone who really suffers from insomnia.I recommend this movie to everyone who haven't seen it, and especially for those who liked ""Memento""...",Insomnia

After that,director starts to increase film's swirl like her other productions.Insomnia isn't as good as Inception if we talk about the scenario and Memento if we talk about the processing.However,this is a normal situation because Inception and Memento are cult movies in their branches.Let's see it's positive sides.These are great acting,perfect chosen scenes and making a sensation about final.It is interesting that Al Pacino in heading role doesn't win any awards although her look,mimic,behaviors and the most important is her acting insomnia wonderfully.Beside Al Pacino, Hilary Swank and Robin Willams fill the bill in their roles.

As for Hillary swank and Al Pacino I believe they fitted the part perfectly and convinced me into believing there lifestyle.

After meeting with the fresh, young detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), and stopping at a local hotel, they start investigating the corpse. They find out that she had been beaten to death.
