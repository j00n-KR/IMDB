0,MartinHafer,"At least it is not the worst Bond film,....but it's sure close",3,2 June 2006,"Apart from the terrible VIEW TO A KILL, I think this is the very worst Roger Moore James Bond film. Most of the blame was on the insistence in having Jaws reappear in this film. Although there were many Bond fans who loved him and he was tolerable in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, he was an embarrassingly stupid character that demeaned the series. I have read all the Bond books and I understand that in most cases the movies only borrow the titles from the original books, but in this case the entire spirit of Bond is gone and the ""thrust"" in on gadgets, a stupid villain and sexual innuendos like calling Bond's love interest ""Dr. Goodhead""--wow, what a surprise he actually got some nooky from THIS lady. In general, the movie is like a Bevis and Butthead interpretation of Bond.",Moonraker
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Not the best Bond, but I wouldn't necessarily call it awful either",6,25 August 2010,"I personally didn't love or hate Moonraker. It has a lot of flaws, but it does have strengths too. What didn't quite work so well is that the plot is unexceptional on the whole, while apart from Sir Hugo Drax's dialogue the script has a lot of ups and downs. Also the film does drag quite badly, and the film goes on for too long I think. However, whether in space, in Venice or in Rio Moonraker is visually striking thanks to the decent special effects and lovely cinematography. John Barry's score is also really good, not his best, but one of his better Bond scores I think. The direction is not too bad really, while the acting is better than it is given credit for. Michael Lonsdale steals the show, while Lois Chiles is good enough as Holly Goodhead and it was nice to see Richard Kiel as Jaws again. Roger Moore has been better but he wasn't awful either, in fact I liked him and feel he was much more convincing than he was in A View to a Kill, where he was starting to show his age. Overall, not the best Bond or the best of the Roger Moore Bonds(personally I think that goes to Spy Who Loved Me) but Moonraker is better than Octopussy and A View to a Kill, again that is my opinion. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Moonraker
2,bkoganbing,"""Take Me Around The World Again James""",8,15 February 2011,"My favorite James Bond film with my favorite James Bond has 007 foiling one of the wildest plots ever concocted by a Bond villain. Michel Lonsdale plays Hugo Drax, billionaire industrialist has a scheme to exterminate the undesirables and impose a new world order from no less than outer space. Adolph Hitler with all his theories on racial purity is a piker compared to what Lonsdale has in mind.Roger Moore is 007 in Moonraker and British Intelligence brings him in when a US space satellite is hijacked in mid flight. The satellite was designed by Lonsdale's company and when Moore starts investigating Lonsdale, some very nasty traps are set for him, all of which James Bond has to elude.The official Bond girl in Moonraker is Lois Chiles playing Dr. Goodhead, part time scientist and part time CIA employee. Does she live up to her name, you have to watch Moonraker to find out. Her scientific skills are even more valuable than her romantic ones.Richard Kiel returns as super villain Jaws. He was a most menacing figure in The Spy Who Loved Me and Cubby Brocoli must have thought he was good enough to use again as he survives in that film. In Moonraker he does the bidding of Lonsdale, but Moore makes the rather logical argument that the racially perfect world that Lonsdale has in mind will have no need of freakish people like him. Kiel has to do some serious reassessment in Moonraker.Moonraker got an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects, but lost to another classic space adventure, Alien.Even with three succeeding James Bonds, Moonraker remains my favorite film with my favorite 007, Roger Moore. Just the breathtaking extent of the villainy gets me every time I see it.",Moonraker
3,Leofwine_draca,"Silly, yes, cheesy, yes; but it's never boring",6,29 August 2016,"Despite the uneven storyline, the weak attempts at innuendo, and a distinctive recycling of the action sequences (mainly the chases), there is still plenty to be enjoyed in the much-maligned MOONRAKER, Roger Moore's fourth outing as Bond and the first to incorporate a distinctly science fiction approach to the proceedings in the wake of the success of STAR WARS, although this only becomes apparent in the last thirty minutes of the movie. The first part consists of the action-packed globe-trotting antics that we expect from the series, with locations including Italy, California, and Rio de Janeiro. Despite an emphasis on open comedy and absurdity this time around instead of the more serious thriller aspects of previous instalments, the formula still works, thanks to winning performances and plenty of excitement.Action this time around includes a speedboat chase through the canals of Venice, an exciting battle with an assassin in a glass museum, and of course the large-scale outer space war which culminates the movie, including a cool moment involving a laser shoot-out between two armies of floating space men which wins points for imagination if not realism. Roger Moore is once again on top form as Bond, playing it less seriously than ever and enjoying himself in the part immensely. Lois Chiles, however, is not one of the best leading ladies, but she has a likable personality that comes across well and which stops her from being the worst. Michael Lonsdale excels as the arrogant villain Hugo Drax, Corrine Clery is seductive as an unlucky ally, and Richard Kiel is the best thing in the movie as the character of his assassin Jaws is more fully explored than in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. As I said, this isn't the greatest, but you can do a lot worse (try watching any of the Brosnans again for instance) and the sense of fun about the production makes it impossible to dislike.",Moonraker
4,SnoopyStyle,"Girls, Shuttles, and Jaws",7,23 December 2013,"Roger Moore returns for another James Bond movie. This time someone steals a space shuttle mid-transport. He investigates Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), the manufacturer of the shuttle, who turns out to be the man with the evil scheme. Bond follows clues across the globe while dodging Drax's assassins including Jaws (Richard Kiel). Along the way, CIA agent Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) joins forces with Bond.There are a lot of hot girls in this one. Maybe that's why Lois Chiles don't stand out as a Bond girl. In this one, I remember much more of Jaws' girl Dolly. And quite frankly, Jaws remains the greatest Bond villain henchman ever.The story is convoluted, and outlandish. They've literally gone out into space. The action is stretching out into exotic sightseeing. This is the formula now especially for Roger Moore. It works for a Bond movie. It's an escapist adventure.",Moonraker
5,Horst_In_Translation,"A slight step back in quality, but still a decent movie",6,7 May 2020,"This is ""Moonraker"", a 007 film from 1979, so this one is over 40 years old already now. It runs for over two hours and with Oscar-nominated director Lewis Gilbert and his writer Christopher Wood, we have a duo here that was also in charge of other 007 films. Experience is definitely key here. This also applies to Roger Moore. If I am not mistaken, he appeared in seven 007 movies and this one here was number four, so exactly in the middle. Moore was in his early 50s when he starred in here and once again, there are some pretty good moments for him. Some scenes were more memorable, others were more on the forgettable side. But one thing I found really obvious here is that this was definitely not the most realistic Bond. It already starts with how he falls out of the plane and has to get the parachute from the other bad guy. Or another smaller example: how Bond actually kills the other shooter later on, the one who is hiding in the woodwork. And he does so intentionally. Could he even know that one was there? And finally of course the lengthy sequence in space at the end of the movie and the whole idea of how the main antagonist wanted to breed a somewhat superior race there and kill inferior humans down on Earth. And as much as Moore is in the center of the film, one mention from me goes to Richard Kiel, who returns as Jaws in here, but a somewhat different Jaws than in the previous movie and sadly a Jaws I did not appreciate that much. For the most part, he still tries to kill Bond, but their encounters are different now. There's always other people getting in the way and when they are man vs. man for once, it almost always results in jaws making strange (though admittedly funny) faces. How he takes a turn for the good side even eventually with his girl. Yep, he can open a champagne bottle too with his teeth, by the way funny how Moore showed his teeth when he ran into Jaws again early on on one occasion. Also fighting next to Bond and not against him was difficult to get used to. Oh well, I am still glad he was alive in the end, but maybe I think they wanted to give him too much of a story here. He was really enough when he pushed Bond out of the plane early on and when he, with his massive phyysical presence, also jumps down and approaches Bond up in the air. He is a lot up in the air in this movie by the way. Also debatable how realistic it is that he actually survived the very early fall because of the circus tent. But I expressed my opinion on realism here already. And I also wonder why he was already trying to kill Bond up in the sky when there wasn't even a connection between 007 and the main antagonist that Jaws was working for now. Yep he switched from Stromberg to Drax.Now let's talk about the girls. First would be the singer: Shirley Bassey is of course always somebody you can rely on and nobody else probably would have turned this theme into a better song. Still, it is not one of my favorites. The chorus is nice and easy to remember and catchy, but that is really it unfortunately. By the way, here in contrast to the previous film and song, the title of the movie is also the title of the song. Maybe Bassey's weakest Bond song though. Next up the Bond Girls: They are alright, but I can see a bit why people hardly remember the names of Chiles, Cléry and Bolton. Maybe the least remembered trio of Bond girls from the entire franchise. A bit of a pity because at least Chiles deserved some attention. She was a scientist, but also a decent fighter as we find out eventually. Already during the paramedic scene. You can't trust anybody. How did Drax get all these men? Anyway, back to Chiles/Holly: She is pretty attractive, even if my favorite is Bolton, even if she is in reality not Brazilian at all. It's all about the character. Also pay attention to how Bond warns her and I had a feeling maybe she would get killed as well, just like Cléry's character who is also warned by Bond earlier, but with her it was really obvious something tragic is going to happen. It's a bit of a tradition that female employees of the bad guy fall for Bond and switch sides, even if the way in which she was standing there while Bond was dealing with the safe was nothing too interesting or inspired. Eventually, it is about nobody but Chiles' character, who also works for the bad guy early on. Said bad guy is played by Michael Lonsdale. He reminded me physically a bit of Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton in Fargo), just chubbier. I'd say that Lonsdale was alright in those scenes he had. But they weren't written too well, also how Bond kills him eventually. Still nothing uncommon at all that they cast a Central/Western European actor as the main antagonist. Lonsdale was born in France, even if his name does not show it. Basically, from beginning to end, it was constantly Drax' men trying to kill Bond. Obviously without success. They came really close though when this Asian guy (first career performance for actor Suga apparently) almost manages to speed Bond to death in a centrifuge. In fact, this sequence was among the very best the film had to offer. Really haunting moment with how it gets faster and faster and also when it's over, we have Bond looking up and seeing Drax's aide there and he knows immediately what's up and who is the bad guy here, although it was a bit strange because I felt there was very little reason to assume Drax is the antagonist before that. He has a presentation similar to Stromberg's/Jürgens' in the previous movie, but his real motivations stay a mystery until the really far-fetched Noah's Ark idea becomes a factor.I want to mention a few more scenes. Some were alright, others not so much. For example the fight sequence with this Asian guy did very little for me. Sure isn't on Oddjob's level. A better sequence was the one in Italy that involved basically the mafia acting on Drax's behalf. Bond makes sure that somebody who is hiding in a casket really shouldn't be alive if he picks this location. I mean the guy that is throwing knives at him. There Bond also got a bit lucky. So you see Bond really got to travel a lot here. Italy and Brazil are just two examples included in this film. That was alright and captured the countries' spirits nicely. However, the entire space idea and why Drax did what he did did very little for me. This film came out ten years after the first moon landing by Neil Armstrong and maybe the hype was already mostly over by then. Kinda fitting that Stromberg in the previous movie made a statement about how men should first explore the planet (especially the seas) before they move on to distant stars and then they make a film like this one here right afterwards that takes us into space. Yeah I struggled a bit with that and I won't deny it. But nonetheless there were enough good moments for me to still enjoy this film overall, even if it is among my least favorite 007 films I suppose. How they eventually destroy those items about to kill millions of people did not entertain me too well either. One would have been enough. Moore is also his cheeky self of course. Wait, is there really a scene in which they say something about ""coming from behind"" or so and Bond made a connection to this particular style of sex? That was almost bold for 1979. By the way, there were hot girls in this film everywhere, even those you only see for a few seconds. Maybe the one thing missing was a hot blonde Bond girl, but I prefer brunettes anyway, so not gonna complain. Well there is this girl at the counter or even Jaws' girlfriend if you want to count her. Also in the previous films, it was a bit of a tendency that Moore takes care of the main antagonist's main helper at the very end (the guy with the metal arm, Nick Nack, Jaws), but here no such thing sadly. I liked that idea. No such character even as Jaws was already Team Bond by then. Okay, that's pretty much all then. The Cold War component is also only minor this time. All we find out about the Soviets is that Gogol is having intercourse with hot young females, another blonde there by the way. Maybe I was wrong. Oh yeah, gotta mention that this sea snake may not be on the level of the shark Jaws took care of in the last film, but still pretty impressive to prevail in this fight for Moore's 007. Another thing I did not like too much was how Q as not a factor this film at all. Even his gadgets were pretty unspectacular, although admittedly they save Bond's life several times. But that sling or bola or whatever it is called was nice, they should have used that on another occasion, not just for practice. Okay, I shall finish. I give this film a positive recommendation, but just a cautious one. Maybe this one is indeed a bit lost in spectacular action sequences and special effects and lacks the usual Bond charm. For example, I have never seen a laser who did not impress me at all like the one in here. I do love lasers otherwise! Nonetheless good to see it was nominated for an Oscar in the visual effects category though. Some of the stuff depicted in here was indeed fairly spectacular. It lost to ""Alien"" though. ""Moonraker"" deserves to be seen, but there are many other 007 movies you may want to check out before this one here. The story may take you to the stars, the quality won't.",Moonraker
6,mark.waltz,The moon's raking up stinky cheese.,4,16 August 2017,"""Look after Mr. Bond. See that some harm comes to him."" That leads to one of the few great moments when Roger Moore uses one of his secret weapons to stop a machine simulating a space ship whirling around faster than any amusement park ride. This is one of the few misfires in the first two decades of the series, going more for laughs and less for thrills as Bond strives to protect a British investment in a huge rocket, resulting in him going over the world for no seemingly real purpose. Richard Kiel's villain ""Jaws"" returns, having a nice dance in the sky with Bond in the opening sequence, and getting a bizarre ""cutsie"" romance in the second half of the film. While a semi followup to ""The Spy Who Loves Me"", it seems like its walking along with its own drumbeat. It helps to watch these two films back to back, simply to tie in the Jaws character, although it goes way overboard in many moments.Every adventurous moment strives for comic relief, and while there are laughs, there's also a scratching of the head feeling that goes along with it all. That's never more obvious than the initially thrilling Venice scene where Bond's gondola suddenly parades through the town square as confused tourists look on. A tense action sequence with Kiel and Moore battling on a high up people mover in Rio de Janeiro starts off promisingly and ends up with a farcical outcome that has to be seen to be believed. Lois Chiles is a rather ineffective ""Bond Girl"". To top it off, Shirley Bassey's theme song is one of the blandest ever. Moments of comic genius mixed with the usual Bond elegance can't hide the fact that this is the silliest entries in the series. Spoofing the spaceship music from ""Close Encounters"", this seems like a Bond film as seen through the eyes of Mel Brooks.",Moonraker
7,classicsoncall,"""... you defy all my attempts to plan an amusing death for you.""",7,21 December 2018,"Watching the James Bond series of films in order of release reveals that the filmmakers in charge had no problem at all recycling some of their bizarre plots. In the prior movie of the series, ""The Spy Who Loved Me', I thought it was fairly derivative of the story to use an immense seagoing vessel to hijack a British and Russian nuclear submarine, much like a SPECTRE space ship 'swallowed' an American space capsule in ""Dr. No"". But here, in the very next movie, we're back to hijacking an American space capsule on loan to the Brits, with Roger Moore called on to save the day for MI6. I guess if you watched these movies far enough apart as they came out over the past half century it wouldn't be as noticeable, but I had a tendency to shun this franchise for whatever reason that I can't really put my finger on. Watching them one right after another today and it becomes pretty apparent that there was a dearth of new ideas that could have kept the movies a lot more original.That's not to say they weren't entertaining in their own right. This one seems to have picked up on the ""Star Wars"" craze of the late Seventies and some of the outer space scenes actually looked fairly decent given the technology at the time. I kind of like Roger Moore as Bond; not having read any of the Ian Fleming novels, I'd like to think that he comes pretty close to the written Double 007. But some of those puns he comes out with - one can only cringe. And who thought it would be a good idea to give the female lead a double entendre charged name like Goodhead given Bond's reputation with the ladies? If there were a MeToo movement around back in the Seventies, this one might never have made it out of the blocks.What's kind of cool here though is the return of Jaws (Richard Kiel), probably a bit too cartoony as a villain compared to his portrayal in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", but still a formidable presence. However he was shown to have some humanity when he actually fell for a pint size blonde girl (Blanche Ravalec) with the feeling being mutual. She's identified in the cast credits as Dolly but I don't recall her name ever being mentioned. She must have had an effect on the giant villain because he made that sudden turn in the story right after the Moonraker mastermind Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) made that crack about populating his new world with only perfect specimens. Either that, or he really wanted to impress his new gal with what a great guy he was. Or maybe it was just love at first bite.",Moonraker
8,gavin6942,A Superior James Bond,8,14 June 2017,"James Bond investigates the mid-air theft of a space shuttle and discovers a plot to commit global genocide.People always say that Sean Connery was the best Bond, but I am starting to doubt this. Roger Moore, whether by coincidence or not, seems to be in the strongest entries in the franchise. ""Spy Who Loved Me"" is fantastic and this really picks up where that left off.I especially love the continuing story of Jaws, and how... somehow, someway... he manages to find love in this crazy mixed-up world. This entry also has more comedy than usual, as well as even a hint of western. It seems like they were trying to throw as much in a stew as possible, and it actually works.",Moonraker
9,jboothmillard,Moonraker,4,12 September 2005,"This not only sees the fourth film for Roger Moore as James Bond, but we also see the return of the tall metal-toothed henchman, Jaws (Richard Kiel). Basically a rocket belonging to Drax Industries called the Moonraker has been stolen by an unknown group, and it is Bond's job to find it before it does something bad. He meets secret CIA agent known first as Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) and she accompanies him in his search. The villain that has stolen this rocket is Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) himself, the main threat is a city in space holding lethal gas holders (this gas by the way does not affect animals or plants) to spread to the Earth. After years of being quiet, Richard Kiel does get a line of dialogue, so look out for that. Also starring Corinne Clery as Corinne Dufour, Geoffrey Keen as Sir Frederick Gray, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, Toshiro Suga as Chang, Emily Bolton as Manuela and the final appearance of Bernard Lee as M before his death of stomach cancer. One thing to mention, the last film said Bond will return in For Your Eyes Only, but with the hype of Star Wars (out two years earlier), the filmmakers decided to create their own version, or perhaps rip-off to tap into the same target audience, and it did work for making its money. After watching it more closely, I can see why the critics give it two stars. Drax isn't the best villain, the effects are a little tame, and the story could have used a little tweaking, but their are still some good moments, e.g. Bond spinning in that gravity force thing. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 20 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for Dame Shirley Bassey's title song (they also mentioned the 70's dance/disco remix), and it was number 61 on The Ultimate Film.

10,ccthemovieman-1,"Not Great, But Still A Likable Bond Movie",7,10 January 2006,"Without Sean Connery in the starring role, I wasn't expecting that much, so this was a pleasant surprise because I found it to be one of the better Bond movies. I'm not saying it was one of the better-made, just one I enjoyed more than most. Except for Roger Moore as Bond, the actors in here are mostly no-names. However, it was entertaining, had some good action scenes, lots of pretty woman, almost no profanity and some nice European and American scenery. The opening six minutes of action was great as were the opening credits. Gee, I sound like I'm describing almost all the Bond movies. Well, I just felt this one is a notch above most of them in the categories listed above. The only negative to me was the ending, unfortunately. It was just too hokey and didn't live up to the excellence of the first 100 minutes.",Moonraker
11,Tweekums,Bond in space!,8,16 March 2012,"At the end of 'The Spy Who Loved Me' we were promised that Bond would return in 'For Your Eyes Only' that was before 'Star Wars' burst onto the world's cinema screens and suddenly everybody wanted science fiction! As well as tapping into the post 'Star Wars' demand for Sci-fi 'Moonraker' made use of space shuttles which a the time were still being prepared for they first flight. The film opens with the midair theft of a shuttle that is being loaned to Britain by its builder Drax Industries. Naturally Bond is assigned the case and is sent to California to meet Hugo Drax; the man whose company builds the shuttles. When people start trying to kill him it is clear that something untoward is doing on there. A document he sees leads him to Venice where he bumps into Dr. Holly Goodhead, a woman he first met at Drax's facility and who claimed to work for NASA. His searches lead to a lab that is manufacturing a deadly nerve gas. His next stop is in Rio where he bumps into Dr. Goodhead for a third time and discovers that she wasn't being entirely honest with him. After surviving a run in with Jaws he heads deep into the jungle and finds that Drax has built a shuttle launch facility. Sneaking onto a shuttle Bond and Goodhead are taken to Drax's orbital space station where they learn of his diabolical plan to kill everybody on Earth so he can repopulate it with his 'perfect people. Bond and Goodhead must stop him before he can succeed and in doing so the receive help from an unexpected quarter.This film is obviously best remembered for the rather far-fetched space battle at the end; this is a shame as there are plenty of great moments before they get there; Bond's brush with death in a giant centrifuge, his fight in a glass museum, a confrontation with Jaws on a cable car above Rio and a great boat chase where he hang-glides over a waterfall just to name a few. Roger Moore continues to do well as Bond and Richard Kiel makes a welcome return as the steel-toothed Jaws. Drax is played by Michael Lonsdale who does a fine job and has some great lines. Lois Chiles gets to be more than just a pretty face as Dr. Goodhead; fighting alongside Bond and even piloting a shuttle. I know a lot of people will find this film sub-par due to its bandwagon jumping Sci-fi elements but I rather enjoyed it; silly moments included!",Moonraker

13,BA_Harrison,"A silly, spectacular spy-fi adventure.",7,31 December 2011,"I admit it—even at the tender age of eleven, I had problems with the laser battle at the climax of Moonraker, recognising it as a lame attempt by the James Bond camp to jump on the Star Wars bandwagon. I also had issues with the film's many other unbelievably corny moments, especially the pigeon doing a double-take, Bond and Holly Goodhead leaping to safety from a Rio cable car, and the previously emotionless professional killer Jaws experiencing love at first sight.Over the years, though, my disdain for Moonraker's abject silliness has waned somewhat, with me eventually accepting the camp nature and tongue-in-cheek humour as part of the Bond series' evolution; as Moore grew obviously too old for the part, self-mockery was inevitable, and besides, after Pierce Brosnan drove an invisible BMW and para-surfed a tidal wave in Die Another Day, nothing that Moore ever did as Bond has seemed quite so stupid again!Nowadays, I watch this one with an admiration for the spectacular sets, gorgeous women, breath-taking scenery, impressive special effects, and an undeniable sense of fun.",Moonraker
14,moonspinner55,A sci-fi stiff...,4,19 October 2007,"James Bond blasts off into the galaxy in order to stop a madman from creating his own 'perfect' world in space and destroying Earth. Roger Moore was very much in command as James Bond for the often eloquent ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" in 1977 (it was really Moore's peak as Agent 007, as he exuded both charm and masculine grace). In ""Moonraker"", Moore seems as alien to James Bond as any newcomer to the role would be. He seems to have stepped into the part by chance, and when he outwits his new leading lady (the leaden Lois Chiles) or the bad guys, he's just relying on exteriors--there's nothing of consequence going on underneath. This spy adventure takes place mostly in space (not the fastest moving of scenarios, unless you've got George Lucas as director), and brings back Richard Kiel's wonderful steel-toothed villain Jaws from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", but it's an enervated story which bears scant resemblance to Ian Fleming's book. ** from ****",Moonraker
15,BandSAboutMovies,Bond wars,6,11 April 2020,"Could James Bond be relevant in a post-Star Wars world? If Moonraker had anything to say about it, yes. Up until GoldenEye, it was the highest-grossing of the series, making $230 million worldwide.But wait - didn't the end credits of the last film promise James Bond will return in For Your Eyes Only? Sure they did. However, the producers chose the novel Moonraker because of the aforementioned Jedi-starring George Lucas film.One could also argue that Hugo Drax's plan is exactly the same plan as Karl Stromberg's in The Spy Who Loved Me: blow up the world and go away to build your own civilization. This time, it's in space versus underwater.Here's the weird thing: for such an iconic British character, this movie's shooting was moved from the tax heavy UK to France. This is also why Michael Lonsdale was cast as Drax instead of James Mason and Corinne Clery was Corinne Dufour. Ah, the 1965-79 film treaty in action. Well, I have no complaints about Clery, who is also in Yor Hunter from the Future and Fulci's The Devil's Honey.Lois Chiles (Creepshow 2) had originally been offered the role of Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me, but was in temporary retirement. In actuality, bad reviews had sent her back to acting school and she ended up getting the role of Holly Goodhead when she was seated next to director Lewis Gilbert on a flight. Jaclyn Smith had almost signed for the part but had to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts with Charlie's Angels.This is perhaps the silliest of the Moore movies - well, there's also him bedding Grace Jones in A View to a Kill - and it's nearly overflowing with effects and gadgets. But hey - Jaws turns good, gets a girlfriend and opens a bottle of champagne by biting into it. So there's that.There remains an urban legend that Orson Welles was making his own version of this movie, as Fleming intended it to be filmed as early as 1955. The rumor is that 40 minutes of raw footage exists with Dirk Bogarde as Bond, Welles as Drax, and Peter Lorre as Drax's henchman.",Moonraker
16,Coventry,Bond Interstellar Bond,5,2 December 2015,"What with the tremendous success of contemporary movie-franchises that (partially) take place in outer space like, ""Star Wars"" or ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" or even ""Superman"", James Bond naturally couldn't be the action hero who remained with his both his feet on the ground and thus the 11th official 007-adventure deals with topics like the conquest of space, the theft of hi-tech shuttles and – top of the bill - a genuinely absurd finale set in an outer space cult- community! By 1979, the familiar Bond formula had pretty much turned into a pastiche of absurd plot lines, cartoon-like villainous characters, ludicrous gadgetry and polished stunt work. It wouldn't be until the next installment, ""For your eyes only"", before James Bond returned to more old-fashioned story lines and down-to-earth action sequences, and so ""Moonraker"" qualifies as one of the weakest entries in the whole series. Weak in terms of plot and plausibility, that is, because the last Bond film directed by Lewis Gilbert is undeniably fun and entertaining in a light- headed/undemanding type of way. When a massively expensive and hi- tech space shuttle gets stolen during its transportation from the US to England, James Bond is promptly put on the case to discover the whereabouts of the shuttle as well as to save diplomatic relationships with the Americans. He begins his search at the gigantic Californian estate of the shuttle's manufacturer, Hugo Drax, and quickly realizes that he doesn't have to look any further to meet an evil opponent. Drax owns secret research laboratories and warehouses in Venice and entire rocket-ship launch platforms in Rio De Janeiro. Why? Because he plots to exterminate the entire human race with nerve gas and breed an entirely new master race in outer space, of course! 007 teams up with the yummy CIA agent Dr. Goodhead in order to put a stop to the shenanigans, but Drax recruited a familiar ugly face from Bond's past to stall him, namely the metal- teethed Jaws. Okay, so admittedly you can't really claim that ""Moonraker"" is a masterpiece of realism or suspense, but the film works fairly well as a tongue-in-cheek Sci-Fi/action comedy and Roger Moore clearly feels comfortable in his more comically- orientated role. Hugo Drax (Michael Longsdale) surely had the potential of becoming one of the most legendary flamboyant and over- the-top deranged villains, but his part remains rather vague while more screen time is offered to the indestructible Jaws (Richard Kiel). The special effects are impressive, clearly very expensive and were righteously nominated for an Oscar (although they lost – also righteously – against ""Alien""). ""Moonraker"" doesn't deserve a spot in my personal top five, or even top ten of James Bond movies, but still I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a two hours of mindless good fun!",Moonraker

19,hitchcockthelegend,At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery.,7,5 June 2012,"Moonraker is directed by Lewis Gilbert and adapted to screenplay by Christopher Wood from the novel written by Ian Fleming. It stars Roger Moore, Lois Chiles, Michael Lonsdale, Richard Kiel and Corinne Dufour. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Jean Tournier.Bond 11 and 007 is tasked with finding out what happened to the Moonraker space shuttle that mysteriously disappeared up in space. His investigation takes him to the billionaire builder of the craft, Hugo Drax, where Bond discovers a fiendish plot to start a new world of perfect human beings.At the end of The Spy Who Loved Me we were told that James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only, but the gargantuan success of Star Wars and a rekindling of all things sci-fi led Albert Broccoli to send 007 out into space! Armed with a $30 million budget and using only the core base plotting of Fleming's novel, the makers crafted what many feel is the runt of the James Bond litter. The money ""is"" up there on the screen, it's excess overdrive, outlandish from start to finish and actually is very very entertaining. The problem is that in James Bond terms it barely feels like a Bond movie, it actually could be any bloke propelling the story, this is a guy reliant on gadgets and not his brain or brawn, quipping away purely for the sake of a cheap laugh. Ultimately it's a cash in, both in terms of the sci-fi boom hitting the late 70s and of the James Bond name.If judged away from the Bond universe on its own popcorn terms, film is a blast, literally. As a whole it's a bit choppy, but many of the parts desperately trying to make up a cohesive blockbuster are great entertainment. Mid air scrap for a parachute, a cable car sequence brilliantly realised, centrifuge chamber peril, boat chase, laser fight and much space age malarkey, the film is chocked full of crowd pleasing moments. In fact it's often mistaken as being a film set in space, when in fact the action doesn't move up there until the last half hour, the previous hour and a half is spread out over France, Italy, Brazil, USA, Gutemala and of course England. The score and the title song, however, are very much Bond. With Barry and Bassey back respectively, film is filled with appropriate atmospheric space strains and a hauntingly emotive theme song. Charaterisations are a mixed bag. Lonsdale's Hugo Drax is one of the better Bond villains, dignified, well educated and wallowing in a life of luxury, he's perfectly understated in Lonsdale's hands and in fact steals every scene he shares with Moore's Bond. Holly Goodhead (Chiles) is a bold Bond girl with many skills, she's a scientist and an astronaut, attractive and decently played by Chiles, if a touch unmemorable in the Bond girl universe. Kiel is back as Jaws, with the makers choosing to make him some love sick puppy dog, where once was a unique villain, now is cypher for slapstick and a crappy flip-flop of plotting, while the ""love interest"" for Jaws, Dolly (Blanche Ravalec), is cringe worthy. Sadly this would be the last appearance of Bernard Lee as M, but he leaves a favourable mark, as does Desomond Llewelyn as Q, but once again Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell) is all too brief, the flirt and banter she used to share with Bond now seems long gone.With a committed Bond fan base trudging through the turnstiles to see the latest instalment, the sci-fi fans intrigued by the themes of the story, and the general blockbuster loving crowd, Moonraker made a colossal $203 million at the worldwide box office. Making it the highest grossing Bond film so far, a record that would stick until Brosnan's debut in 1995. While critical notices were not as bad as some would have you believe, the critics clearly judging it on non Bond terms. Broccoli took notice of the fans, though, who were upset by the lack of respect to the serious side of Bond. He promised things would be different for Bond 12. 7/10",Moonraker
20,Theo Robertson,Flogging A Dead Horse,3,22 July 2002,"Jaws in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME was a brilliant Bond baddie so on paper bringing him back for MOONRAKER must have seemed a good idea . However he should have been killed off in the pre credits sequence because the more he`s used in the film the more and more ludicrous he becomes in very mechanical set pieces which climax in the scene where he opens a bottle of champagne and declares "" Here`s to us "" .

22,zardoz-13,007 Goes Space Tripping!,9,27 January 2012,"Albert R. Broccoli sneaked into George Lucas' backyard--outer space--with director Lewis Gilbert on the eleventh James Bond epic ""Moonraker,"" the absolutely most outlandish 007 thriller ever made. Basically, ""Moonraker"" was an overblown version of ""Goldfinger"" with an audacious battle sequence at the end with Space Marines storming a space station established by the ambitious villain. All Bond movies are essentially alike, being stitched together with episodes from other Bonds. Hugo Drax steals a space shuttle on loan to the United States from Britain and M dispatches 007 to investigate. The pre-credit sequence where Bond performs a free-fall without a parachute is one of the best in franchise. Later, when Bond is strapped into the gravity simulator, he emerges looking pretty wiped out. The scene is the most realistic of any Roger Moore Bond. The gondola scene in Venice is rather far out and goes over the top later when Bond's gondola becomes hovercraft. Jaws who had menaced Bond in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" returned but he was no longer a villain as he joined sides with 007. ""Moonraker"" ranks as one of John Barry's best orchestral scores, especially the bits during the theft of the space shuttle at the beginning. The riff on ""The Magnificent Seven"" in South America is cool as well as the monastery that serves as a training ground for spies. One of Q's coolest gadgets is the sleeping sombrero clad fellow who turns out to be shell concealing a machine gun. Lots of fun!",Moonraker
23,Boba_Fett1138,"James Bond tries too cash-in quickly, after the sudden success of Star Wars.",6,1 September 2006,"It's no secret that this movie was made only because to the sudden and unexpected huge success of the science-fiction movie ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"", that changed the genre for ever. ""Moonraker"" wasn't planned as the 'next' Bond movie. In the late '70's the Bond movie and character started to get outdated. In an effort to make the Bond-series popular and more fitting and 'hip' for its time and foremost to also cash-in quickly of course, ""Moonraker"" was created. The end result is a mixed bag of memorable Bond moments, set in a incoherent story consisting out of unlikely moments and disjointed sequences.By no means ""Moonraker"" is an horrible movie. It still entertains and provides some good and typical Bond moments which we basically all grew up with watching and love so much. It might very well be so that this is the Bond movie with the most memorable sequences in it. The opening sequence is also definitely one of the most memorable Bond ones. However as a whole the movie just isn't quite good enough and falls short. This movie definitely isn't the most consisting one out of the Bond series, mostly because of the reason that the sequences don't always connect with each other. Its basically the one well made sequence after the other, without always making an obvious connection.The premise of the movie sounds good but the story gets more and more ridicules and above all improbable, even for a Bond movie, as the movie progresses. Especially from the moment on when Bond enters space the movie and its story starts to go downhill rapidly. The movie gets highly unconvincing from that moment on, although it definitely still has some good moments after that point. I don't know, I guess its just the fact that the Bond character doesn't work in space that causes the movie to get unlikely and not convincing enough.But like I mentioned before, the movie is still entertaining enough. Show me a Roger Moore Bond movie that isn't entertaining...Roger Moore is my favorite Bond because of the fact that his movies are the most entertaining ones (although they also are far from the best Bond movies) to watch over and over again, which is definitely mainly thanks to Moore's more comical and less serious approach of the Bond character. He had fun playing the character and that must have inspired the rest of the cast and crew because it really shows on screen. The movie itself really does have some great and entertaining moments as well. Most of the action is really good, until the end, when the special effects kick in. It's good enough for 1979 standards, especially when considering the resources the creators at the time had to their disposal but nevertheless it still means that it just isn't convincing enough all. It all adds up to the reasons why at the end this movie falls flat. Don't get me wrong its still good and entertaining enough to watch, after all I think I must have seen this movie a dozen times already but the movie and its story just isn't of very high quality, especially when compared to the other Roger Moore Bond movies.But the movie still also does have more than enough good points to consider this a above average entertaining-flick. The fact that the usual Bond regulars show up again is definitely an huge plus. Bernard Lee makes his last appearance as M and Geoffrey Keen reprises his role of Sir Frederick Gray for the second time. Their roles are probably a bit bigger than they normally are in a Bond movie. Also of course Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell are also present again, as well as Walter Gotell as General Anatol Gogol. But the biggest plus of the cast is Richard Kiel who reprises his role of the hit-man Jaws, with his metal teeth, after ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". He provides the movie with some of its very best moments. Unfortunately it always was the last Bond movie he ever appeared in. Also the production design and always reliable good John Barry musical score are a big plus. The John Barry scores always provide the Bond movies with a certain extra.There also is little wrong with the important Bond element; the villain. Michael Lonsdale plays an excellent and memorable villain. Perhaps the very best and most memorable of all Bond villains, I kid you not. He and his character deserved to be in a better Bond movie. That way his character would have been an even better and also more memorable and appreciated Bond villain. I just have a weak for Michael Lonsdale, he is a very underrated but above all very underused actor.It has more than enough good elements and sequences to please the fans and the more casual viewer. It's just too bad of the disjointed and improbable story, which causes this movie to be one of the more incoherent and lesser Bond movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Moonraker
24,Uriah43,Comedy in Lieu of Good Suspense,6,23 December 2015,"When a space shuttle on loan from the United States to Great Britain disappears over the Atlantic Ocean, ""James Bond"" (Roger Moore) is called in to investigate. This investigation takes him to various places like California, Venice and Rio de Janeiro with each place getting more and more dangerous. Now as far as this movie is concerned I have to admit that I didn't think it was one of the better James Bond films produced. One reason for this is that the director (Lewis Gilbert) went a bit overboard on the comedy in lieu of good suspense and this caused the film to seem a bit cheap and silly at times. For example, having one of the female scientists with the name of ""Holly Goodhead"" (played by Lois Chiles) is the kind of humor one would expect in an elementary school playground. But is it really necessary here? When considering the fact that this gag was already played in ""Goldfinger"" (i.e. ""Pussy Galore"") then it seems to me that the joke gets less funny each time it is attempted. Likewise, I didn't particularly care for the love affair between ""Jaws"" (Richard Kiel) and ""Dolly"" (Blanche Ravalec). Again, while it may have been good for a couple of quick laughs it didn't elevate the overall movie to levels comparable to most James Bond films. Even so, I liked the performance of Roger Moore and the presence of several beautiful actresses like Corinne Cléry (as ""Corinne DuFour""), Emily Bolton (""Manuela"") and the aforementioned Lois Chiles certainly didn't hurt. Along with that, I must admit that even a mediocre James Bond movie is generally better than most movies of this type and I have rated the film accordingly. Slightly above average.",Moonraker

Lois Chiles plays a CIA agent(Holly Goodhead) who helps him with his investigation, which takes him from Venice, to Rio, then finally outer space! Richard Kiel also returns as hulking hit-man nicknamed Jaws.Though hurt by some undeniable silliness and copying of ""Star Wars"", I still found this a fun adventure(as long as you don't think about credibility too much!) that benefits from the good will left over by Roger Moore's growth in the role, and the previous film ""The Spy Who Loved Me"".

Drax, meanwhile, has hired a old friend of Bond to take care of any problems.....It's ironic that Jaws makes another appearance in this movie, because is the movie where Moore and the creators really jumped the shark with Bond. I'm not saying its a bad film, I really enjoy watching it, it's just unbelievable that this movie is from the same franchise as From Russia With Love, and even Skyfall.Moore once again is great as the worlds most famous secret agent, and whirl this is the film where he really starts to show his age, he and the rest of the cast and crew are clearly having a ball.It's clearly cashing in on Star Wars, but unlike other copycats,Mathis has a really good story, amazing concept, and pretty wonderful narrative. It's just that when the film goes daft, it gives us double taking pigeons and that gondola.Action scenes are as good as expected, but this time, whenever Jaws is on screen, he doesn't feel as threatening as he should, because we know he's there because he was just so popular.Saying that though, the Mardi Gras scene with him walking slowly down the alleyway still gives me the creeps to this day.The soundtrack is wonderful, the effects are still surprisingly good even to this day, and even know its one of the lesser appreciated Bond movies, it's still one of the most successful.",Moonraker
28,Aaron1375,Good Bond film that followed The Spy Who Loved Me's blueprint,8,6 January 2015,"Through the years there have been countless sequels. Some times when a film company makes a sequel they use the same formula from the previous film. Usually this is done because there is not quite the time to develop a completely unique plot. An example of this would be the Batman franchise. There were three years between the first Batman and then Batman Returns and three years between Returns and Forever. All three films whether you liked them or not were unique and different. Then they cut the time by a year and they rushed Batman and Robin which followed the blueprint of Forever. Not entirely the same movie, but you see the similarities as the film follows the same flow. Another example is Ghostbusters and Ghostbusters II. This one is a bit more perplexing as they had five years between films, so while you can see that it is following the same flow as the first film, I am still not so sure why they did it. Now for this film...at the end of The Spy Who Loved Me it states that Bond will return in For Your Eyes Only. Instead, the film is Moonraker, a film with a plot, villain which are very much like those found in The Spy Who Loved Me; heck, this film even has the same henchman in Jaws. Obviously, they wanted to put Bond in space because of films like Close Encounters and Star Wars and while the film was put together hastily it performed quite well at the box office and was actually a very good Bond film. Just not as good as the film whose formula it follows.The story has a space shuttle being hijacked midair as it rides on the back of a plane. Seems it was under British care so now they have to send Bond out to find what happened to the shuttle. This leads him to the maker of the shuttle, a man known as Drax who is obsessed with the conquest of space. Bond will travel the world to find out what happened and things begin to get very sinister when he finds a strange room in a glass factory in Venice where a very potent poison is being manufactured. Bond's final stop takes him into the stars as he must infiltrate Drax's space station...built in secret and containing a very deadly secret indeed.This film has loads of action and fun. Roger Moore does great once again as Bond, and the other characters are good too. Just seems they did not really get too many big stars to be in this one as Richard Kiel as Jaws is one of the few actors I know other than the normal Bond regulars. I believe this was Bernard Lee's last Bond film as M. There are scads of Bond girls in this one and Louis Chiles is okay, but she is not in the same league with Barbara Bach. Heck, out of all the girls in this film, the most attractive one for me was the very short blond who Jaws falls in love with...she certainly had the best bosom of the lot.So this film was very fun and good, but it does have a bit of a been there done that feel to it as well. However, not so much that it detracts from the movie in a majorly significant way. This film also contains more comedy than did Spy as Jaws goes from being a very dangerous foe who kills to a bit of a comic relief person. The final scene is a bit strange as it does feature a laser fight in space, but they did a pretty good job considering the lack of time they had to make this film. The laser battle in space almost looks like the one found in Flash Gordon and I wonder if Dino De Laurentiis may have been inspired by it a bit. So in the end, a good Bond film that may have borrowed a bit from Spy, but still manages to be different enough to be entertaining in its own way.",Moonraker
29,Wuchakk,One of the best of the Moore era,8,3 October 2013,"I steered clear of ""Moonraker"" (1979) for years because critics almost unanimously said it was awful. So when I finally sat down to view it I fully expecting a dog. Wrong! ""Moonraker"" is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end and is one of the best of Roger Moore's 7-movie stint in the series.The plot revolves around 007 investigating Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) after a space shuttle on loan to the British is stolen. James slowly discovers that Drax has a mad scheme to recreate a race of perfect human specimens. The giant Jaws (Richard Kiel) returns from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (1977) as Bond teams-up with the beautiful Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles). The story climaxes with a spectacular battle at Drax' space station.Everything in ""Moonraker"" is over the top: The locations, the action, the villainous scheme, the humor, the seriousness, Jaws and the space finale. This works fabulously because Bond films were never meant to be deep, thought-provoking pieces of art, but rather grandiose pieces of thrilling eye candy with an amusing sense of the absurd.One thing that I demand in any Bond adventure is great globe-trotting and spectacular locations. This is one of the reasons I consider ""License to Kill"" (1989) weak, but ""Moonraker"" delivers in spades! The film starts out with breathtaking scenes high above Napa Valley, California, as Bond engages in a thrilling sky-diving duel. From there we get France, Venice, Rio De Janeiro, the jungles of Brazil & Guatemala and the spectacular Iguazu Waterfalls, Argentina.Lois Chiles is one of the more beautiful and competent Bond ""girls."" Of course her name, ""Dr. Goodhead,"" is ludicrous in the tradition of Pussy Galore and Chew Mee. Meanwhile Drax is a formidable, serious nemesis contrasted by the cartoonish villainy of Jaws.The film works on every level in entertaining the viewer but, depending on one's tastes, some people may have a cavil or two. For instance, many criticize the goofy humor associated with Jaws. The good thing is that it's actually funny and you'll likely bust out laughing a number of times. Regardless, the picture remains an essentially serious story, albeit totally outlandish, which is in keeping with the series, e.g. ""Goldfinger"" (1964) and ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967).Others object to the notion of Bond in space. I don't get this beef. He's been all over the earth and in every ocean, why not an adventure in space for something new? Some have criticized that ""Moonraker"" was trying to go ""Star Wars,"" but this makes no sense; ""Moonraker"" has nothing in common with ""Star Wars."" It would be like arguing that ""Thunderball"" (1965) ripped-off ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" because it has underwater scenes.Something else I'd like to point out: One of the reasons I steered clear from ""Moonraker"" for so many years was because I thought most of the film took place in space, and space is not something I seek in a Bond flick, but this isn't the case. Bond doesn't go up in space until over an hour & a half into the story! Only like 23% of the film takes place in space. More importantly, the climax is actually interesting and exciting unlike the ending of, say, ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" which isn't as compelling.Roger Moore has done more Bond films than any other actor (which is only matched by Sean Connery IF you include his unofficial 1983 entry ""Never Say Never Again""). Roger started the role in 1972 when he was 44 and ended in 1985 at the age of 57 (!!). Regardless of his age he always looked great and perfectly convincing as 007; yes, even in ""A View to a Kill"" (1985). His movies contained more humor and action than the slightly-more-serious early 60's Bond films, which were fantastical and absurd in their own way (e.g. Oddball's killer hat, etc.), but Moore's stint isn't so different when you consider Connery's later films, like ""You Only Live Twice"" and, especially, ""Diamonds are Forever"" (1971).Many prefer the Connery era, and I certainly appreciate those films, but I find the Moore period to be the most consistently entertaining in the series. Every one of his films was successful at the box office and ""Moonraker"" was the most successful Bond film until Pierce Brosnan's ""Goldeneye"" in 1995. There's not a dud in the bunch. They're colorful, vibrant and full of pizazz.The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes.GRADE: A-",Moonraker

31,SimonJack,Bond goes to space wars in this 007 flight of fantasy,6,25 April 2018,"The moviemakers did a good job in the sci-fi area of making all of this film seem real. After the smashing success of ""Star Wars"" in 1977, it's only natural that the James Bond franchise folks would want to make the next secret agent 007 film in outer space. And, believe it or not, Ian Fleming had written a novel, ""Moonraker,"" in 1954. That was before the first man in space, Russian Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in 1961; and the American landing on the moon in 1969. But, this film apparently uses little more than the title of Fleming's book. Indeed, the ultra-modern designs of everything in the film, including the use of space craft, is well beyond what was being used for space travel fiction even into the early 1950s. All of the space stuff and sets cost a whopping amount -- $34 million. But the film set the record for the Bond series with the highest worldwide box office of more than $210 million. Of course, that doesn't mean it is a great movie. It's script is weak and it suffers from very little intrigue and not much Bond-ness. Let's face it - the space craze that had gripped the world by 1970 had people wanting to see and know and imagine everything possible about space travel. So, much of this film dwells on that. And, on the bad guy - Hugo Drax (played by Michael Lonsdale) who is behind the skullduggery of the film. Richard Kiel returns as Jaws for some never-ending encounters with Bond. And there's just way too many jumps all over the place in this film. It's not a very good screenplay. It tries to put too much into the film. It wears thin after a while and one wonders when it will get on with the Bond story of foiling the bad guys. None of the cast stand out, and but for the very realistic looking stuff in space, this film becomes boring after a while. It gets six stars for Jaws and the space scenes. Here are a couple of decent lines from the film. Holly Goodhead, ""Well, Mr. Bond, I guess we'd better get started. You don't wanna lost time as well as the space shuttle, do you?""Hugo Drax, ""You're not a sportsman, Mr. Bond. Why did you break off the encounter with my pet python? James Bond: I discovered it had a crush on me."" James Bond, ""Where did you learn to fight like that, NASA? Holly Goodhead, ""No, Vassar.""",Moonraker
32,Mr-Fusion,"Not a great movie, but I'm still waiting for that Moonraker laser.",5,14 August 2017,"There's a certain level of camp that one can expect from the Roger Moore era, and ""Moonraker"" certainly could've used more of it. The movie doesn't pick up until Bond and the fair Ms. Goodhead (still a great name) jetting off into outer space, and even then, it's mostly shuttles doing space ballet. It's indicative of the film's overall sleepy vibe. And it's not like there aren't action scenes here. OO7 does battle with a giant python, engages in multiple fistfights and boat chases, and narrowly escapes death by cable car. But somehow, in spite of the stunts, it's a real snooze.5/10",Moonraker
33,ShadeGrenade,"""Take care of Mr.Bond. See that some harm comes to him!""",10,4 July 2006,"Roger Moore's first two 007 films - 'Live & Let Die' and 'The Man With The Golden Gun' - clambered aboard whatever cinematic bandwagons were rolling at the time, such as blaxploitation and martial arts. By the end of the '70's, sci-fi was back in vogue thanks to 'Star Wars', hence 'Moonraker' replaced 'For Your Eyes Only' as the next Bond movie.Until 'Die Another Day' in 2002, it was universally regarded as the nadir of the series. I disagree. One has to remember that around this time Kevin McClory was threatening a 'Thunderball' remake starring Sean Connery, and thus Cubby Broccoli could not afford to takes risk with the formula.The film bears little resemblance to Fleming's book, which concerned a nuclear rocket attack on London. As 'The Spy Who Loved Me' had proved popular with audiences, it was decided to give them more of the same, hence Christopher Wood's script had the villain hijacking space shuttles instead of submarines, and Richard Kiel's 'Jaws' returned to menace Bond. Lewis Gilbert once more supervised the mayhem.Bearded French actor Michael Lonsdale made an excellent 'Hugo Drax'. Like 'Stromberg', he is wealthy, and plans to create a new civilisation by destroying the old one. Ken Adam once again delivers some marvellous sets, such as the Pyramid control centre and Drax's Space City.The action scenes were even wilder that those of 'Spy', including a magnificent free-fall pre-credits scene, Bond's gondola turning into a hovercraft, Jaws and Bond getting to grips on a cable car over Rio, a speedboat chase in South America, and a shoot-em-up finale in outer space. John Barry produced another fabulous score, particularly 'Flight Into Space'.As a strapping young lad growing up in '70's Britain, I always made a point of seeing the latest Bond, usually with my friends in tow. We did not care if the films were faithful to Fleming, if there was too much humour, or if Moore was wooden, we went to have a good time and did.No offence to Connery, but for us Moore was The Man. Suave, sophisticated and debonair. On leaving the theatre we would attempt to recreate Bond's fights, usually resulting in one of us being cautioned by the police.And the gadgets! 'Moonraker' outdid them all. I once tried to build Bond's wrist-dart gun. I don't think anybody walked out of a Timothy Dalton Bond feeling like they could conquer the world, but with Roger's we did. And we saw them more than once in theatres.I do wish that some of the gags had wound up on the cutting room floor, namely 'Jaws' flapping his arms after his parachute breaks, Alfie Bass' cameo as a drunken Italian, and a pigeon doing a double-take as Bond's gondola roars by. Take these out and you have a pretty decent Bond movie.Sadly, 'Moonraker' marked the final appearance of Bernard Lee as 'M'.",Moonraker
34,JamesHitchcock,A Little Too Tongue in Cheek,6,12 July 2005,"Although all of the Bond films contain elements of fantasy, ""Moonraker"" has perhaps the most fantastic plot of all. It is less a spy story than a science-fiction movie, probably influenced by the vogue for outer space adventures that followed the success of ""Star Wars"". Although the scenes set on earth clearly take place in the seventies, without any attempt at a futuristic look, Drax's space station clearly could not have been built with seventies technology. (Indeed, it still looks futuristic today, a quarter of a century later). It has a similar plot to that of its immediate predecessor, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". In each, Bond must thwart a megalomaniac industrialist who has ambitions which go far beyond simply achieving world domination. Both men intend nothing less than the near-total extinction of the human race and its replacement by a new, purer society. Stromberg in the earlier film hopes to build this below the sea; Drax in the later hopes to repopulate the world with the descendants of a few physically perfect individuals who have survived the holocaust on his space station in orbit above the earth.This is far from being the best of the Bond series, but I would not agree with the opinion I have seen on this board that it is the worst; that dubious honour belongs either to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", with the inert Mr Lazenby, or to ""A View to a Kill"", in which Roger Moore's performance finally toppled over into self-parody, or ""Licence to Kill"", which was really a violent revenge thriller dressed up as a Bond film. In terms of quality, ""Moonraker"" is probably on a par with some of Roger Moore's other outings in the role, all of which have their own particular strengths and weaknesses. The strengths of ""Moonraker include an excellent musical score from John Barry (possibly the best of any Bond film), a well-handled final battle aboard the space station, and a notable villain.Whereas some of the Bond villains have a back-story that would explain their villainy, Hugo Drax is a mysterious figure. We never learn what background he came from, how he rose to become the head of a powerful industrial conglomerate or how he developed his insane quasi-Nazi theories of racial purity. Even his identity is doubtful; Drax is a genuine, if unusual, English surname, but he is clearly not an Englishman. He lives in America, but is equally obviously not an American. (To judge from his accent, he is probably from somewhere in central Europe). Michael Lonsdale's makes him into one of the most frightening characters in the whole of the Bond series, a man who hides a vicious sadism beneath a veneer of culture and sophistication. He seems all the more chilling because there is nothing insane about his manner, but rather delivers his lunatic speeches in a calm, deliberate and sonorous bass voice.Unfortunately, ""Moonraker"" also has its weaknesses. Lois Chiles, who plays the heroine Holly Goodhead, is a better actress than Barbara Bach (who played the heroine of ""The Spy Who Loved Me""), but to say that is to damn her with the faintest of praise, as the improvement is only a slight one. Although Holly is supposedly an astrophysicist and CIA agent, she came across as beautiful but shallow, so much so that I wondered if her surname should have been ""Airhead"". I felt, however, that the film's greatest weaknesses were Roger Moore's performance and its overall tone. Moore was never a bad actor in the sense that George Lazenby was a bad actor, but he could be a lazy one, content to stroll through a film without much effort, and ""Moonraker"" has always struck me as an example of this approach. (He was much better in both ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""For Your Eyes Only"", the film which immediately followed ""Moonraker"".The Bond series has always relied on a delicate balance between excitement and humour, and ""Moonraker"" is one of the films in which that balance was pushed too far in favour of the humorous approach. This is partly the fault of Moore's nonchalant approach and partly the fault of the script, which seems too often to be saying ""Don't take any of this seriously"". A good example is the sudden change in the character of the villainous Jaws (who also appeared ""The Spy Who Loved Me"") from murderous assassin to tender lover after he meets a diminutive pigtailed blonde. Some of the chase sequences, particularly the one along the canals of Venice, were a little too tongue in cheek. Like all the Bond movies, this one was entertaining enough, but not one of the best. 6/10",Moonraker
35,Smells_Like_Cheese,What the heck?! Was Roger Moore a huge fan of Star Wars?,5,2 October 2006,"As much as I am happy that I finally got to the introduction of Jaws, I have to admit, I wasn't really into this James Bond flick, it just wasn't as original as the other Bond flicks I have seen so far. James Bond meets outer space and discovers the evil master plan as usual, that Hugo Drax plans to destroy global warming, dun dun dun! Although, I have to admit that Jaws falling in love was just too sweet, it's like freaks have feelings too, you know? :D, just kidding! I love Jaws! He's so cool. Over all, this was an OK Bond flick, not my favorite so far, it was just too much of a copy off of Star Wars. But like I said, I'm just too into Jaws, so I have to give points for such a cool villain!5/10",Moonraker
36,MovieAddict2016,The jump from reality to stupidity.,6,10 February 2006,"""Moonraker"" is an entertaining film - I won't lie - but it is utterly absurd and one of the lesser James Bond movies (at least from around that time period). It is rather unfortunate because Roger Moore was a capable Bond, and this and ""Octopussy"" both tarnished his image - I never thought he was very bad...his tongue-in-cheek humor was a nice alternative; taking over the role right after Sean Connery was always destined to be a mistake. No one can live up to ""The"" James Bond.In this film, Bond is sent into outer space (yep, that's right) to investigate into possible plans for mass genocide on the earth below. So basically what Bond assumes is that the space station floating around in orbit by the earth is being run by Damned Commies or whatever the typical villains are in this case - I guess they're more fascist.It is a pretty poor film. It's utterly unrealistic and at times waaay too over-the-top and tongue-in-cheek -- to the point of self-parody and absurdity, which in this particular case is a bad thing.It's easy to see the jump from exaggerated realism (Bond getting the girls, thwarting the baddies) to outright fantasy - orbiting space stations, plans for world domination via laser-induced mass murder...Nevertheless, this film WAS the basis for Doctor Evil's secret evil lair in ""Austin Powers,"" so we must credit it for at least providing pop culture with SOME benefit.",Moonraker
37,DKosty123,Pretty Dull,5,23 June 2008,"Richard Kiel desperately tries to save this film from the opening sequence. He fails and the reels go on. This film appears to have an excess of special effect sequences which are too far fetched. Could it be better? Definitely, & without Kiel it would be much worse.The most inspired sequence is the laser battle in outer space. The worst sequence is the trained dogs who do not eat until commanded too. The sequence is so bad, that it has to be the all time worst one in Bond History. Proves that this film goes to the dogs.The travel budget must have been cut for this one a memorable places do not have a big role in this movie. Even the women are not much though the haunting voice of Shirley Bassey (also sang Goldfinger) is actually pretty good in the theme song. While the song is haunting, it is not the hit material that most Bond themes are. They should have put the entire film crew in the centrifuge & spun them to try & improve this one.",Moonraker
38,KineticSeoul,Bond in Space!,3,5 February 2016,"After ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" I thought just maybe just maybe the next James Bond movie with Roger Moore wouldn't be a ""007"" spoof. Where Roger Moore wouldn't be a caricature of the silliness that applies to the Bond films he is in. I thought he would be out of that stage and it was smooth sailing from there on...Well I was wrong. I just didn't think the title ""Moonraker"" would literally apply to the films plot. This film starts out alright despite the campy and ridiculous intro of James Bond parachuting and Jaws (the villain from the previous film) returning and trying to kill bond. It's quite obvious they got the idea from that scene from D. B. Cooper. It was actually kind of cool to see Jaws again as one of the villains, he was like a menacing figure in the first one. In this he is like Nemesis from ""Resident Evil 3"" minus the intimidation, he is actually more goofy than a intimidating figure in this. Mainly because of the set ups and Jaw's facial expressions during certain parts. It just made him look like a dumb tall guy at a children's party that just didn't know what was going on. There is one scene where Jaw's falls for a woman after their eyes intertwine, it was sweet but it was very laughable. Anyways like I said this installment started off alright until the Venice chase scene where Bond uses his pimped out Venetian row boat to escape by also being able to move on land as well. The whole super car being able to go under water is alright, but a Venetian row boat that moves on land was comedic for the wrong reasons. There is also other ridiculous parts, but lets just skip to Bond going into outer space. I guess after ""Star Wars"" was such a mega hit, the producers probably wanted to take some ideas from that film. There is even a laser gun in this as well, with the similar guns the stormtroopers have. As for the main villain, it didn't seem like they were trying anymore. Some of the really standout villains are the ones you can sort of understand why they are the way they are. Or at least understand their motives, not necessarily agree with it but understand where they are coming from. That is far from it in this, the past villains was about world domination, money or just killing people. In this one it's the whole ""Noah's Ark"" scenario. Except a human guy that is out of his mind, chooses only certain people that fit his terms of human perfection onto his spaceship. Than wipe out the whole human race so only people he deems perfect can repopulate the world. Overall this is probably my least favorite Bond film compared to the previous one. At least ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" was amusing. Like in some previous Bond films there is a climatic battle scene, well this one is with a band of astronauts and laser guns *sigh*. I like Star Wars as well but some universes should not mix.3.5/10",Moonraker
39,OllieSuave-007,Exciting and Funny Bond Film.,8,7 July 2007,"""Moonraker"" starts with a thrilling scene where the space-shuttle was hijacked and the jet carrying it is blown up in mid air. It then leads to M asking Miss Moneypenny where James Bond is, and she responds by ""he's getting his last leg."" Then, it shows him flirting with a woman, which leads to an exciting and daring scene where Bond jumps out of an airplane to avoid his assailants. This is one action-packed prologue that takes this film off to a fast start, and then to the main plot where Bond investigates the mid-air theft of a space shuttle and discovers an evil plan to commit global genocide. This 007 film is full of brilliant special effects and some neat martial arts type action. The plot is slow at times and drags toward the middle. However, Roger Moore is great, with his hilarious one-liners, like when he utters ""Play again"" after he throws a bad guy down onto a piano and when he says ""Take a one giant leap for mankind"" when he throws another out of a spacecraft. Q has another awesome batch of gadgets to help Bond on his daring mission and to deal with a host of villains, including the sharp-teeth super-henchman, Jaws. The laser-gun fight scene was probably a homage to ""Star Wars,"" which was released the same year, and is definitely the highlight of this film that is not to be missed by 007 fans.Grade B+",Moonraker
40,bensonmum2,"""You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season.""",4,11 March 2007,"Take a look at most of the lists of favorite Bond films found on the internet and you'll usually find Moonraker at or near the bottom. While I don't consider it the worst (I reserve that distinction for Die Another Day), it's not among my favorites either. Most people when writing about Moonraker tend to focus on the ill-advised, Star Wars inspired, laser shootout. As ridiculous as Bond in Space is, it's not my main point of contention with the movie. Instead, I have a real problem with the gag-fest that is Moonraker. It's one lame attempt at humor after another. While humor has always been a part of the series, here it's taken to the extreme.There is no better example of the buffoonery found in Moonraker than the gondola chase scene. (Bear with me here, this is going to be rather lengthy.) It gets off to an okay start as Bond's gondola passes another one carrying a coffin. The coffin's lid opens and the man inside throws a knife at Bond. Of course he misses giving Bond the chance to throw the knife back at the would-be assassin. The now dead assassin falls into the coffin and the lid slams shut. Oh the irony! But we're just getting started. The coffin falls off the boat and floats under a bridge just as a man hacking up his lungs crosses the same bridge. He sees the coffin and immediately gives up smoking. At this point my sides are splitting with laughter! In the meantime, Bond flips a switch revealing that this is no ordinary gondola, but a supped-up MI6 variety of gondola. Out of seemingly thin air, boat loads of baddies appear and begin chasing Bond. During the chase, Bond barely misses a gondola carrying a couple in the middle of a passionate make-out session. They are apparently so into their lovemaking that they are oblivious to the baddie's boat that ""hysterically"" slices their gondola in half. As their half of the gondola sails off (apparently still sea worthy), they remain in their oblivious embrace. The gondolier in the other half isn't so lucky. As his half begins to sink, he continues to use his pole in a vain attempt to stay afloat and gives the camera his best look of comic exasperation. Stop it! I've got tears in my eyes! Just when you think things can't get any worse, Bond approaches land and pushes another button turning his gondola into a hovercraft. It's at this point the real ""fun"" begins. As Bond drives his hover-gondola through a major Venetian square, we are treated to several ""hysterical"" reaction shots. A man drinking wine swears off alcohol. A painter loses his painting and isn't aware it's gone. Even the animals get in on the act as a pigeon gives Bond a double-take. Yes, that's right  a pigeon does a double-take! The utter ridiculousness of this brief moment encapsulates everything that's wrong with Moonraker. Cubby and Company changed Bond from a tough, womanizing spy with a penchant for the occasional quip into a clown with an infinite supply of gags and one-liners. Ian Fleming must have been spinning in his grave.It's really too bad because there are some nice moments and things to enjoy sprinkled throughout Moonraker. If you can excuse Lois Chiles and her impersonation of a piece of wood, the acting is okay for this kind of movie. I've read any number of bad things about Michael Lonsdale as Hugo Drax, but I think he's one of the bright spots. I appreciate his cerebral, understated approach to playing the Bond heavy. Some of the action set-pieces in the first half are quite enjoyable. I particularly like the sword fight in the glass museum even if it does end with on of Bond's more groan-inducing quips. And even the final laser showdown in space is well-filmed and enjoyable regardless of how absurd it might be.In the end, even though there are some things I like about Moonraker, the comedic core of the movie really hurts it in my eyes. The best I can do is rate it a 4/10.",Moonraker
41,gridoon,"Colorful, entertaining and underrated Bond film",7,21 June 2007,"Often inexplicably referred to as one of the worst Bond films (I can easily mention at least one worse from each Bond actor: ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""The Man With The Golden Gun"", ""Licence To Kill"", ""Tomorrow Never Dies""), ""Moonraker"" is an entertaining, large-scale fantasy-adventure that essentially follows the ""Spy Who Loved Me"" formula (so closely, in fact, that it's something of a mystery why that film has such a higher reputation than this one): a megalomaniac villain who wants to destroy the world and create a new one, a female special agent who begins as Bond's rival and later becomes his ally, Jaws as the indestructible henchman (OK, he DOES fall in love in this one....), the various international locations and outrageous gadgets, etc. The two scenes most often criticized as ""too over-the-top"" for Bond, the gondola on the Venetian piazza and the laser space battle, are direct copies of the car coming out of the sea and the climactic submarine battle of TSWLM. What I'm trying to say is that these two films are a lot closer in quality than most people suggest.Roger Moore is in top form in this one - when it comes to sarcastic line delivery and facial expressions, no other Bond actor can match him. Michael Lonsdale is a paranoid but classy villain with some witty one-liners, and Lois Chiles is a step-up from the already good Bond girl Barbara Bach, because she gets the chance to prove her skills in physical combat. Jaws falling in love and turning good is a matter of taste, but Richard Kiel is still fun in the role, and he even gets to speak this time! The production is spectacular from beginning to end - you get the flavor of each location, and at the end you feel as if you ARE in space!Overall, for those who can appreciate the ""lighter"" Bond films, ""Moonraker"" is good entertainment and quite undeserving of most of the harsh criticism it has received.

42,theowinthrop,The Pitfalls of Eugenics (and hurrah for Jaws and Dolly!),7,16 January 2009,"I have to admit that I never became the full fledged fanatical follower (there's some alliteration for you) of James Bond that many others are. I saw DR. NO and FROM Russia WITH LOVE when they came out, then I missed all the Bond films until YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. I did not see GOLDFINGER until about 2000. I still have not seen THUNDERBALL, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, or NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN. As for Roger Moore's films, or George Lazenby's one film, or Pierce Brosnan's, or...well I have not seen most of them.But I did get a chance to see MOONRAKER. The plot of the novel, about a mysterious industrialist who is working on a private project for the British people, always drew my curiosity. It reminded me of other billionaires (Howard Hughes, for instance) who did projects that the Americans got the benefits from (his underwater spy machine that helped retrieve a Russian nuclear device comes to mind). But Sir Hugo Drax is a villain, and he is first raising curiosity when ""M"" mentions casually to Bond that (""Horror of Horrors"") Drax cheats at cards. Shades of the Tranby Croft Scandal.Actually he is not the only Bond villain who cheats. Goldfinger always plays golf for large sums using golfing equipment that gives him an unfair advantage, and also cheats at card games. But Auric Goldfinger is not a British subject.As it turns out in the novel Drax is actually not developing nuclear power to help Britain, but a pair of powerful nuclear weapons to unleash on London. Bond, of course, stops him.That is not the plot here - but then movies have been known to jettison the story line of a plot and create a new one. With the success of the space shuttles, Drax project is to create an outer space station for the Earth's exploration of the solar system. In reality it is being changed for the egomaniac's plan to kill off all life on Earth, and only he and his followers will be the survivors.Moore gave a reasonable performance as Bond (I'm sorry, I like Moore's ""Simon Templar"" on television, but the sturdiest Bond remains Sean Connery for me). Michael Lonsdale was threatening as Drax, but I actually found him too quiet. Give me a more inviting villain, like Gert Frobe as Goldfinger or Joseph Wiseman as Dr. No. Lois Chiles was properly beautiful and reasonably good as an actress as Holly Goodhead (after Pussy Galore my favorite Bond female name).But my favorites were none of these three. It was Richard Kiel (repeating his villain as ""Jaws"") and Blanche Ravelac (repeating her role as ""Dolly"", Jaws girlfriend). Jaws was never in the original Bond novels (the name was invented due to the Stephen Spielberg film) nor was Dolly, but in the second film appearance the screenwriters gave Kiel a bit more for his role than threatening to use his steel teeth to kill Moore. He is forced to flee for his life, and is found barely alive by Dolly, who helps him. A sweet romance develops between the giant and the short sized woman. This was continued in MOONRAKER, but with an ironic twist.Except for this film and Kiel's Jaws (and Ravelac's Dolly) none of the villains or villainesses in the Bond films ever switched sides. The reason here was simple. Up to the last twenty minutes of the film, Jaws is loyally helping Drax as his henchman. He and Dolly are in the space center that is supposed to protect Drax and his followers (and where Bond and Goodhead are hiding). But Drax gives a pompous speech to his followers (all of whom look ""aryan"" in features and proportions) about eugenics and breeding a proper race. Now Kiel rarely had dialog, but he is never shown to be stupid. As he and Ravelac listen they both become dismayed about what they hear. It's obvious that once Drax has put his plans to kill off the population of earth into effect, he will also weed out those who don't fully match his eugenics views (which includes poor tall Jaws and short Dolly). They keep looking at each other as they realize they have backed the wrong horse here. As a result, for the only time in a Bond film, a villain and his girlfriend end up allied with Bond and his girlfriend. It helps tip the balance against Drax. And in the end both pairs of ""heroes"" scoot out on their own space shuttles while Drax's plans literally explode.I really ended up liking that ending. It is improved also by the end of Drax - who is forced to take one giant step for mankind.",Moonraker
43,Lejink,Space Jam(es),5,5 September 2020,"Not ""For Your Eyes Only"" as the legend at the end of the preceding ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" predicted but instead we get ""Moonraker"" brought forward to cash in on the success of recent space-age, sci-fi blockbusters like ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters..."", both of which actually get little stylistic nods during the movie.In ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", I felt the tone was positively set by its thrilling pre-credits ski-jump stunt, quality title song and titles sequence, but here these three components fall a bit flat. The Shirley Bassey-sung title song is weak, whether done as a ballad or disco track (for the end titles), the opening title sequence is dull and the big sky-diving escape is clumsily shot and rendered silly by Jaws' descent directly into a circus net.From there, the Sock-it-to-'em JB formula kicks in, the big baddie (this time Michael Lonsdale as Hugo Drax) announces his nefariousness with a dramatic theft, James is called to London, chit-chats with Moneypenny and starts to pursue his rival, not in Stoke Newington or Barrow-In-Furnace, but naturally in Venice and Rio (the latter at carnival time) and of course it all ends up in outer space. James beds by my account four women in his space race, has three run-ins with Jaws and again combines with a beautiful woman in his mission. Plus, inevitably, there's a massive set built for the climax aboard Drax's space station, Bond and friend escape certain doom about three times before there's the usual race against time to save the world and a closing climax of another kind between James and said friend.I found it all a bit predictable story-wise and pedestrian in pace, the latter not helped by the slow-motion movement in space both inside and outside the various spaceships used. While there is an exciting boat chase round Venice and another in the rapids of Brazil plus I'll admit I quite liked the new gadgets given to James by Q, the whole venture seems flabby and under-powered. There are some bad back-projection shots, the attempts at humour seem forced (the musical nods to other movies had already been done in the previous film) apart from Desmond Llewelyn's re-entry quip at the end and I found the stunt and fight sequences unconvincing.Moore strolls through the part and is noticeably involved in some of the stunts but it's still obvious the director is protecting his talent. The film obviously made pots of money but the franchise was starting to look stale and predictable, making this almost a case of the bland leading the Bond.",Moonraker
44,bowmanblue,My favourite Bond (sorry!),10,12 July 2017,"It's probably a bit controversial to claim that Roger Moore is the best Bond. It's probably even more controversial to say that 'Moonraker' is the best Bond film ever. I know. I've read other reviews. I know it had its faults. I guess, for me and my love of Star Wars, there was just something uber cool about seeing James Bond in space fighting with laser guns (and, yes, I know that they only made a 'James-Bond-in-space' film to cash in on George Lucas' game-changing masterpiece, but I didn't care about that, either!).This time round, the UK government is charged with the task of transporting (and therefore safe-guarding) a couple of American-built space shuttles. However, things do not go according to plan for her majesty's minions when both shuttles disappear in mysterious circumstances. Enter one 007 to get to the bottom of this.Now, as I've mentioned, I do love this film. Maybe because I grew up with it and it's totally tainted with nostalgic memories of watching it round friends' houses on Sunday afternoons. So, rather than saying what's so great about it, I will acknowledge other people's criticisms of what I consider 'Bond's finest hour.' Firstly, people (even more cynical than I am) were taken up with the Star Wars cash-in I've already mentioned. Secondly, there was too much humour. Gone are the days of Sean Connery's dry wit and darker take on Bond and they're all replaced with a lot of tongue-in-cheek silliness involving pet dogs doing comedy double-takes when Bond drives a boat through a crowded market square. The last two major complaints about the film revolve around the casting of the villain 'Drax' and the latest Bond girl – Dr Goodhead (seriously – that's her name!). Now, due to my love of this film as a child, I was more interested in armies of laser-wielding astronauts spinning off into the blackness of space than acting abilities. However, over thirty years later, I do tend to cringe a little when either character opens their mouth. Yes, they really are a little bit wooden. Perhaps I'm being unfair as I guess they do their best with the lines that are given to them. But, for every cloud there's a silver lining – and that silver lining comes in the form of a giant with metal teeth. Yes, 'Jaws' is another baddie hell bent on creasing Bond's tuxedo – and he is as awesome as ever.I know I'm not alone in my appreciation for Moonraker, but I think most people who enjoy it as much as me are my age. I guess it might not hold up too well with the modern audience – it's not the special effects which are the problem (correct me if I'm wrong, but a laser battle in zero-gravity space has never been attempted before on screen!). It's the tone that may not sit well with today's Bond fans. Currently, we have a much darker Daniel Craig Bond who rarely smiles or makes a witty (borderline innuendo) quip. However, if you can appreciate a Bond with a much lighter feel to it (and I know there are people out there who do – otherwise 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' wouldn't be so successful!) then you could do worse than relaxing your brain for a couple of hours and letting it drift into deep space. If nothing else, the final line about 'attempting re-entry' is worth watching the whole film for. RIP Roger – you were always the best Bond (my opinion only!).",Moonraker
45,ThomasDrufke,No Small Step For the Bond Franchise,4,20 October 2015,"Can we all be honest and just admit that 80 percent of the Bond villains to this point are pretty much the same in motivations, setting, and their presence. I don't know why it took this long for me to be bothered by this. Perhaps because Moonraker to be begin with isn't all that fun. After all, you can only get away with normalcy and clichés if you have a great movie around them. Moonraker just didn't do enough for me to be distracted by the same old Bond story.The 4th and least interesting Roger Moore Bond film was fast tracked after the success of 1977's Star Wars. It's pretty crazy that the day after the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer releases I find out that Moonraker was made early due to capitalize on the success of the first film in the Star Wars franchise. They even had a scene in which an MI6 agent shoots a gun that resembles a stormtrooper's. Which is later shown at its full potential later on as each astronaut have these said guns. Most of the film doesn't take place in space at all, in fact, the opening sequence before the credits is nothing short of magnificent film making. I'm amazed they were able to pull off the stunts and special effects needed to make that plane scene work so well. I immediately thought of Mission Impossible when I saw what they were able to accomplish with what looked like minimal CGI.Sadly, that's about as good as the film gets. We do however get another go around with a fan favorite villain, Jaws. If it wasn't clear in the first film, Jaws is virtually indestructible. He literally survives anything thrown at him. I'm honestly surprised they didn't drop him out of a spaceship at the end of Moonraker only to show up in For Your Eyes Only. But there comes a point when he's so unrealistic that you're taken out of the film by him. Although, I do like where his character ends up in this film. The villain we really focus on here is named Drax. He doesn't particularly standout at all. In fact, he's overshadowed by his own henchman, Jaws, for a good portion of this film. It's quite puzzling why a guy like Drax who wants to create a perfect race would target someones like Jaws to be one of it's members.The film comes off as boring and dull which is surprisingly for a plot that includes Bond going to outer space. It's so outrageous of a plot on its own, but there is nothing special at all about its characters, plot, or execution. Lois Chiles' 'Holly Goodhead' seemed to be a rehash of Barbara Bach's Anya, and really a far less interesting or polished character I may add. I love Roger Moore's Bond and I love watching Jaws, but I'm getting tired of those Bond villains and girls that do nothing but spill exposition and give us eye candy respectively. Moonraker contains better special effects, better action, but a far less interesting story and characters. But I will say it was entertaining to watch actors try and exhibit zero gravity by moving in slow motion. So bad it's good. The bottom line is that Bond doesn't do anything that relates to being a spy here at all. This isn't even a Bond film, really.+Jaws is back and better than ever+Opening sequence+Star Wars nods-Same old same old villain-Why Bond in space, why.-For a different setting, everything plays out exactly the way you'd expect 4.8/10",Moonraker
46,cricketbat,Not as outlandish as I thought it would be,7,18 February 2020,"There are many times when Moonraker glides into the realm of the ridiculous. It's full of outlandish premises, terrible jokes, and laughable acting, yet it's still an entertaining movie.

What is people's fascination with bringing franchises into space? It's not a very interesting setting in my opinion. It's not really boring, just inexplicably moronic. I also felt the action wasn't as prominent as some of the other movies in the series, and it doesn't have a whole lot of suspense either. I'm a bit of an adrenaline junkie, so I was a bit disappointed, even if it was watchable. Call me a stickler if you like, but Jaws falling in love? Give me a break! This is around the time where they really began to get too cute with the franchise. I always felt Roger Moore played a solid Bond. He's my 2nd least favorite, but he was entertaining. He is saddled with an extraordinarily silly script here, and there isn't much he can do but be all suave. Lois Chilles is OK as the Bond girl, but they got a bit lazy with her character direction. The twist in her character was done in the previous Bond film with another Bond girl. Final Thoughts: It's not the worst. That dubious honor goes to either A View To Kill or The World is Not Enough. This is still a pretty stupid entry into a series that was starting to get tired. Moore would rebound a bit with For Your Eyes Only, and one of my personal favorites, Octopussy, but this was a major misfire. 5/10",Moonraker
50,ironhorse_iv,"Moonraker rake my eyes. Its license to kill, nearly kill James Bond, forever. It's redeemable only due to its camp value. It's still fun to watch.",6,11 June 2014,"Despite the previous 007 film, 1977's The Spy that Love Me, telling us that James Bond will return in 1981's For Your Eyes Only, producer Cubby Broccoli choose Moonraker as the next installment after the success of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. Another factor that, the film's release was supposed to coincide with the first ever launch of the NASA space shuttle, but this unfortunately didn't occur until later. Being the 11th spy film in the James Bond movie series. The movie was directed by Lewis Gilbert, whom directed the last two previous James Bond films before this. You Only Live Twice (1967) and The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). In the movie, James Bond played by Roger Moore for the fourth time, investigates the theft of a space shuttle, leading him to Hugo Draxs (Michael Lonsdale), the owner of the shuttle's manufacturing firm who is holding an evil secret plan to wipe out world population, and recreate humanity in his own image. Along with scientist Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), Bond must find a way to prevent Draxs from releasing this terrorism plot onto the world. For a movie that supposed to be all about space. The movie only has the last 30 minutes in space. The trailer say that the film will deliver the moon, but it's doesn't. It's nowhere near the moon. The movie Sci-Fi element is so out there, you can toss logic out of the window. Seriously, don't try solving the plot holes, from Space Marines, to how Drax got a Space Station. The movie had unrealistic survival Deus ex machine tone in its writing. Even when the movie is grounded on Earth. It's somewhat had silly action with gondola converting into hovercrafts, oddly done snake battles, and really bad ninjas. You don't see much gunplay, in this movie due to Roger Moore's distaste in guns. Still, there were some great scenes, like the sky cable cart scene and the G-Force stimulator. Most of all, the movie has one of the best James Bond opening stunt scenes ever with two men freefalling fighting over a parachute. The only problem is how cartoony, it got toward the end, mostly with metal teeth giant, Jaws (Richard Kiel) looking like an idiot Wile E. Coyote. It get worst with the big man when he fall in love, half way through the film. The stuff with Jaws and his girl is just awful. It's made cheesier with Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet theme. It's the ultimate in bloated. The reason, why for this big change from a great menacing henchman to goofy big guy was due to children writing to the director, wanting to make Jaws into a good guy. In my opinion, that was a really dumb idea to have the character return from 1977's Spy Who Love me only to murder his badass appeal even more. The movie is beautiful shot. I love the locations in the film, ranging from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, to Venice, Italy. There were some really good intense moments, such as Corrine Dufour (Corinne Cléry) being hunted by dogs chase that was beautiful haunting shot. The movie humor is more of a hit than miss for me. Bond on the quail hunt was a bit fun to watch. Roger Moore is alright in the role. Moore's Bond is a sociopathic jester; while author Ian Fleming's Bond is a shell-shocked veteran with an alcohol problem. When it comes to Lois Chiles, frankly, I just found her to be boring, as both a character and actress. With a name like 'Goodhead', you would think, she would stand out more. In my opinion, she's one of my least favorite Bond's girls. This movie was the final Bond film to feature Bernard Lee as M; he died after this movie. Drax comes out as a typical James Bond villain with over the top evil plan. It's pretty much, the same plot of the previous film. Drax's background as a Nazi party member is completely absent from the movie version. The movie might share the same title as the novel, somewhat similar plot and few characters, but for the most part, the two are nearly different. In the book, there wasn't no Dr. Holly Goodhead, but Gala Brand who share a few common characteristics. Most of the character ideals for Gala Brand would be used later in other James Bond's films, such as 2002's Die another Day. Also, worth noting is that Jaws wasn't a character in the novel. He appear extensively throughout the movie. The biggest different from the book is none of the action in the novel occurs in space. In fact, none of the science-fiction elements of the movie are based on situations described in the novel. The title song was sung by Shirley Bassey, the third and last time she did so in the Bond series after doing 1964's Goldfinger & 1971's Diamonds Are Forever. The lyrics sucks, and the music isn't the best. There are some clever hints to other films such as the tune of Steven Spielberg 1977's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The movie does have some bad editing such it was rushed into production. There is a really bad lazy double take pigeon in the film, that a bit distracting. The special effects were mediocre. It can't help seeing the awkwardly intercuts with blue screen in certain scenes. The budget for Moonraker was more than the combined budget total of the first six EON James Bond movies put together and it shows how clunky, it is. I guess, people at the time, wanted a less serious spy-thriller as it made a lot of money at the box office at the time. Overall: Campy as hell, but still entertaining.",Moonraker
51,kenjha,Bond Meets Star Wars,6,3 May 2009,"The eleventh in the series and the fourth to feature Moore, it starts off pretty well as Bond investigates the disappearance of a space shuttle, taking him from California to Venice to Brazil. The locales are nice and the action scenes are well executed. Then the action shifts to space and the film becomes tedious and drags on far too long. It's obviously an attempt to cash in on the recent success of ""Star Wars"" but the film would have done better to stay grounded. Lonsdale makes a capable villain while Chiles and Clery are lovely if standard-issue Bond girls. Kiel returns as Jaws, gets a girlfriend, and even gets a line of dialog. Barry provides one of his better scores.",Moonraker
52,The-Sarkologist,Bond just keeps on being Bond - even in outer space,7,28 October 2013,"Moonraker held the record of being the worst James Bond movie ever made, that is until we were hit with 'The Living Daylights' and 'License to Kill' and even they they only held the record for a short time before the movies that seemed to have come out of a random title maker (Tomorrow Never Dies and the World is Not Enough) were released, but it has been quite a while since I have seen those one, so I will not pass judgment until I actually watch them again.Anyway a space shuttle is being loaned to the British by the Americans (I didn't think the British had a Space Program, let alone the facilities to launch a space shuttle, but then again, this is a James Bond movie and logic tends not to play a huge role – also, I didn't think the shuttle program had started at this time – no wonder the Russians got the idea of the space shuttle, the stole the idea off of a James Bond movie) and the guy who sold it to the Americans, who are in turn loaning it to the British (for whatever reason only the film makers actually know), decides that he wants it back so, instead of saying 'hey, can I have my space shuttle back, I need it to take over the world' he steals it. This was a bad move because it means that Bond has to go on an adventure so that he can push this guy out of an airlock (oh, sorry, I gave away the ending).So Bond travels to California where he meets a beautiful woman, but she is killed. While he is snooping around this house, he find a single reference to Venice, so, for no other reason than this single reference to Venice, he decides to go to Venice (hey, any excuse to go to Venice). When he gets to Venice he meets a beautiful woman, and drives a Gondolla through the middle to St Mark's Square (there are a lot more pigeons there than when I went). He then sees a crate with Rio De Janero on the side. Guess he better go to Rio, but then again, I don't blame him. When he gets to Rio he meets a beautiful girl.However, the bad guy his having some difficulties killing James Bond because Bond seems to be immune to death, and when he discovers that Jaws is in between jobs, he decides to hire him to kill James Bond. So Jaws eats a cable that holding up a cable car, and then crashes the cable car into a building where – he meets a beautiful woman.However Bond's travels haven't come to an end yet because they learn that the bad guy is making a deadly poison out of a flower that grows only in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, so he goes on a boating expedition and gets into a boat fight with a bunch of boats. While fighting the boats he once again outwits Jaws, who goes flying off the top of a waterfall, and as it turns out, like James Bond, Jaws is also immune to death.Then I discover, thanks to James Bond, that there is actually a Mayan Pyramid in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. I also discover what ridiculously rich people actually want all their money for – they want to build a fleet of space shuttles, fill them full of beautiful people (some of which James Bond met, but before he can make a witty comment about being surrounded by beautiful women, he is dumped into a pool of water which contains – no, not piranhas, but a boa-constrictor), fly them up to a space station, and then spray nerve gas on the rest of the world so that he can have it all to himself.We also learn that the US has a battalion of Space Marines, just in case a super villain, or a ridiculously rich capitalist, decides to build a space station and populate it full of beautiful people, so that he can then kill all the ugly people, and return the Earth to some form of Edenic paradise. His mistake was that he forgot that Jaws and his girlfriend weren't actually beautiful people.The moral of this story – don't upset Jaws.",Moonraker

A view to a kill is also better. I do not think they is any thing wrong with a James Bond movie that is realistic. But I think that it should no be the b all end all. Realistic only matters so mush for documentaries. The James Bond movies are action movies. What is more important in these movies is how entertaining it is. No one goes to a middle earth movie and worries about how realistic it is. Realistic does not matter in movies most of the time. Sean Connery and Daniel Greg are great as James Bond.

54,slightlymad22,"Highest Grossing Bond Movie At The Time, But Far From The Best",5,29 February 2020,"MoonrakerThe end of Spy Who Loved Me ended with 'James Bond Will Return In For Your Eyes Only' but due to the success of Star Wars it was decided Bond would go to space.The most expensive Bond all time (more than double The Spy Who Loved Me's budget) They pulled out all the stops and there is no denying it's the biggest, most over the top, larger than life Bond of all.There is a lot I do not like, it is so far removed from how the franchise started out, it's almost a parody of itself. I hate the actual stealing of the Moonraker in the pre title sequence. It's totally ridiculous and unbelievable. Speaking of ridiculous I hate the free falling without a parachute scene!! Awful, obvious Stunt doubles and lame comedy ruin what shout be an intense moment. Moore's Bond's Encyclopaedia style knowledge is getting annoying. He is just so smug.Lois Chiles is ok, but she is no Barbara Bach, who my god was so hot. Watching the movies back to back, Chiles really suffers in comparison. Also Bond is really a sex pest in this one, especially to Corrine he even gets the poor girl killed, in a REALLY horrible scene. It disturbed me as a kid, and I still hate it to this day. For such a camp and light hearted movie, this scene is too dark and totally out of place. Worse they even make the franchise's best villain Jaws, comic relief. He goes from Intimidating to imbecile. There is pathetic slapstick gondola chase that ends in a blatant rip off of Spy Who Loved Me, with everyone looking at Bond too.Something I had never noticed before was the amount of product placement in this. At least thy will have helped with the huge budget.It does have some things I like, Ken Adams brilliant sets, the special effects, Shirley Bassey's song, Drax's helicopter pilot Corrine has a mesmerising cleavage. Say what you want about the silliness of the Moore movies, they certainly had the best Bond girls to date. Draw has some good dialogue, I always get a chuckle out of the name Doctor Holly Goodhead. And Q's line ""I think he's attempting re-entry sir"" kills me every time.Moonraker became the highest grossing movie in the franchise as it grossed $70 million at the domestic box office to end 1979 as the 9th highest grossing movie of the year.",Moonraker

Roger Moore was good and Richard Kiel is always good. I was a little surprised when Jaws got his large self a girlfriend and she wasn't bad looking either and I really think Jaws/Kiel is just not a neat person but a handsome man as well.

57,zkonedog,Not That Great...But Yet I Still Like It!,5,3 March 2017,"By most accounts, ""Moonraker"" should be a middling Bond effort at best. The villain is weak, the plot is like tissue paper, and the acting is supremely over-the-top. Yet, for some reason, this movie has always just provided me with some great, thoughtless entertainment!For a basic plot summary, ""Moonraker"" sees James Bond (Roger Moore) run up against Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), a crazed entrepreneur bent on conquering Earth from his space base. Along the way, Bond enlists the help of Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), as well as the traditional orders from M (Bernard Lee) and gadgets from Q (Desmond Llewelyn).Perhaps I can stomach this movie so well because it was one of the first ""old Bond"" movies I ever saw, right when I was getting into the franchise, but I think there are a very inherent ""saving graces"" that indeed make it watchable:-The space theme, which is very different from the typical Bond fare and makes this movie unique to the series. -The character of Jaws (Richard Kiel), who is one of the most exciting Bond villains of the entire run. He is never the ""main baddie"", but as an ""evil henchman"" you can't get any better! -Moore's lighthearted Bond can sometimes get sickening, but for some reason the shtick works pretty well in this one, getting even some legitimate laughs throughout.Overall, even though ""Moonraker"" can, at times, be the epitome of cheese-ball and eye-rolling cinema, it still can be enjoyed by Bond fans looking for ""something different"".",Moonraker
58,johnnyboyz,"Lacking imagination, lacking creation and lacking any real sort of bite; Moonraker is a tepid, less involved entry to Moore's Bond tenure.",5,17 August 2011,"There isn't really any other place to begin in regards to one's opinion on the eleventh entry to the Bond franchise other than with the circumstances behind its creation. Dreamt up following the financial success (or, as they'll tell you down at United Artists, the ""financial and critical success"") of 1977's Star Wars, and it's important to get this out of the way, the film exists purely as a cash-in; a buying into the hype; an investment on the behalf of the company in the hope it will pay out; a placing of one's money within an established field with the hope a little extra will be made on top. The sentiment rings painfully true when we observe the promise at the end of the canon's last instalment, the wonderfully taut The Spy Who Loved Me, during which it was inferred that James Bond would return in For Your Eyes Only – a direction and an adaptation the makers were clearly already thinking ahead toward, only for the monolith that is the race to cinematic space to kick-in and force the producers down an altogether different route. As a stand alone film, Moonraker comes at us as a perfect encapsulating of this thinking: an after-thought, or an excursion; a project we clearly weren't going to undertake but might as well do so now.The film begins with that of a mid-flight shuttle-jacking, as it hitches a ride on that of a British jumbo jet. Its theft is reminiscent, in what is one of a number of unsuccessful riffs on the previous entry, to that of The Spy Who Loved Me's opening and its depiction of a submarine thieving; here, two thuggish stowaways falling out of bunks and blasting off acting as a tepid substitute for agonising panic on board a British sub and the pained expression on its captain's face as he sees what is hidden from our view. Distraught, the British government react and decide to investigate the missing of the shuttle; enter Roger Moore for the fourth time as James Bond, whose obligatory introduction that he wins out over all odds arrives in the form of an impressive sky dive sequence, but would you really wear shades as one man does if you were skydiving? Moore sleepwalks his way through the film which, admittedly, provides him with very little to do but go through motions; he is sent to an initial port of call in the form of French shuttle entrepreneur Hugo Drax (Lonsdale), whom resides in California, and it turns out too quickly is guilty of the crime after all. Whilst there, he meets an American space engineer named Holly Goodhead (Chiles) and she verbally matches him; the opening exchanges moderately pleasingly but without the involving causality involving varying parties after a MacGuffin as was apparent before, where the manner in which Bond and Goodhead try to act as one another's foils throughout does not match up to that of Bach and Moore's interplay from last time out. Very quickly, Moonraker settles into a groove devoid of many thrills. After an establishment that Bond is in no way infallible to the space age, outer hemisphere-orientated stuff on show, that being by way of an unpleasant encounter in a G-force machine, the film opens up into a ""plot"" of sorts largely consisting of fight scenes and skirmishes; these range from an unfortunate encounter with a funeral barge to that of an, admittedly, well choreographed martial arts sequence in a museum and its attic, but it is exclusively the second unit stuff driving this entry. Bond will charge to places such as Venice and the Brazilian rain forest, gradually putting together clues that allude to something a whole lot more sinister than just a case of a missing rocket, but it sounds more exciting and more roomy than it is – this being the Bond film in which the hero covers a lot of ground without there actually feeling like an awful lot of ground is being covered. Other highlights include a bunch of inconsequential allusions to other science fiction films, although a cable car fight is rather good, as well as a truly bizarre sequence in which a siren leads Bond into a python's pit surrounded by other glamorous women - an apparent punishment for Bond in what has been a leering attitude towards most up to this point. On the gadgeted side of things, and where a car-turned-submarine rolled out of the sea in a remarkable instance in the last entry, Bond here drives a gondola-turned-automobile through a Venician square, in what is one of the more distressing riffs on the previous effort which in no way carries the majesty of before.Lewis Gilbert is the unfortunate individual ushered in to direct it; a film very much distancing itself from any essence of creative licence or core subscription to the belief of filmmakers coming in and making material their own. Much nearer the end, when the ethic of whether or not a supervillian has room for his often scarred; often freakish henchmen in the bold new order of flawlessness is challenged for what might be the first time in the series, the hulking lackey Jaws, famously played by Richard Kiel, has a change of heart and decides to join Bond and his female accomplice in trying to thwart the dastardly bad guys. Such a happening is the result, not of careful deliberation in reaction to how a specific text or framework might naturally evolve, but of audience demand; because the public liked the character so much, they desired a reason to root for him away from his primary concern of having to kill Bond and his allies. Such a decision veers directing, indeed filmmaking, away from that of films at the hands of auteurs and into a more submissive realm of 'what the audience want, they get; desire for a creative mark or not'. Moonraker? More like box-ticker.",Moonraker
59,filipemanuelneto,Outer space now belongs to Bond,6,31 March 2016,"Directed by Lewis Gilbert and produced by Albert Broccoli, has script by Christopher Wood and is the eleventh film in the franchise. Its definitely the great Bond film about the conquest of space, topic that other films had approached. For Brazilians, its a special film because it was partially filmed in Brazil.In this film, James Bond investigates the disappearance of a space shuttle belonging to Drax Industries, which largely finance the aerospace project. He begins with a visit to the headquarters of the firm, in United States, staying at the château of Mr. Drax, a man fascinated with the conquest of space. After several dangers, the trail leads Bond to Venice and Brazil, where he discovers the frightening plans of the villain.To some extent, Drax is like Stromberg, the villain of the film that preceded it. Both feel a fascination for environments that aren't naturally theirs, and both despise humanity and are ready to make it disappear. However, the decision to make the film an authentic space odyssey was, probably, a response to the increasing popularity of science fiction films due to the Star Wars trilogy. One of the most famous scene in the movie is the approach to the space station built by Stromberg in Earth orbit. Equally famous is the scene where Jaws (who returns in this film and gradually turns into an good guy) finds love after the famous fight scene in the Corcovado's cable car. To date, its the only villain in the franchise that redeems and presumably becomes good. Machines and inventions also continue to be part of the Bond films, which a famous Venetian gondola who turns into an hovercraft.In this film, apart from central casting inherited from the previous films, Lois Chiles gave life to the bond-girl Holly Goodhead, Corinne Clery played Corinne Dufour, Michael Lonsdale was the villain, Drax, Richard Kiel returned to the role of Jaws and Bernard Lee plays, for the last time, Bond's boss, M.

61,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Bond"" literally shoots for the moon",6,10 January 2018,"The late '60s and '70s launched the outer space/alien science-fiction sub-genre, so of course James Bond had to strap on his spacesuit for 1979's ""Moonraker."" An extravagant production with the highest budget ever for a ""Bond"" film (costing more than twice the price of 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me""), the film's ambition appropriately matches its title.With ""Spy Who Loved Me"" director Lewis Gilbert and writer Christopher Wood back on board for this film, they each try to outdo the strengths of their previous work. Bigger sets and locales and more creative stunts seem to be the name of the game, and such goals usually lead to a franchise movie like this becoming too formulaic. ""Moonraker"" doesn't have a story that flows with nearly the same energy of ""TSWLM;"" rather, it's a necklace strung with death traps that Bond (Roger Moore) must continuously escape.When a Moonraker space shuttle goes missing, Bond travels to California and meets its manufacturer, the extravagant and wealthy Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) along with one of his scientists, Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles). After thwarting a number of plots against his life, Bond flees Drax's estate and heads to Venice to find out what Drax is up to and ultimately follows his sinister plot to Rio de Janeiro and the Amazon before literally launching into space.It so happens Drax enjoys the sport of trying to kill Bond rather than plotting something that will actually succeed, allowing at least a dozen opportunities for Bond to save his skin. With ""Spy Who Loved Me"" henchman Jaws (Richard Kiel) now conveniently in Drax's employ, there's plenty room for hilarity too. Ultimately, this exercise in ""trying to kill Bond"" grows exhaustive and the spectacle that elevated ""TSWLM"" loses luster in ""Moonraker.""That said, even if the stunts and big action sequences aren't anchored by a compelling plot, Wood and Gilbert manage to make good on the promise of making them even more amazing. The skydiving opening is completely thrilling, the Rio cable car sequence has a unique and memorable spectacle to it and famed ""Bond"" production designer Ken Adam's space station offers a lot to marvel at. Perhaps Gilbert and Wood could have planned ""Moonraker"" in such a way that would keep it a little grounded and not simply rip the ceiling off ""Bond,"" but the film does go to outer space after all.For all the points ""Moonraker"" scores on spectacle and innovation, it loses in intrigue and espionage. In other words, ""Bond"" drifts a little too far away from its roots and plays up the caricature elements. In this effort to go where no ""Bond"" has gone before, it feels a bit detached and hollow. Still, the thrills and spectacle it does shoot for at least hit the mark in terms of entertainment value-the big bucks are put to sufficient use.~Steven CThanks for reading!

62,marmar-69780,moonraker,3,3 June 2020,"Moonraker is for sure the most silliest bond film in history and i can see that to some people can become guilty pleasure since it has some laugh on laud moments and stupidity of some scenes is hilarious and apsurd as hell,moore as bond was in this film just to much,his lines and acting felt like he was making fun of his character and like he played it without respect to fleming and fans,also what they did to jaws,he was very scary and intimidating villain in previous film but here he was likeable and become friend with bond,there is also scene in space where they shoot lasers at each other i will just live it at that,moonraker is hilarious bad film",Moonraker
63,Anonymous_Maxine,Roger Moore's best.,8,9 August 2001,"I have to admit that when I began to watch Moonraker, I had very low expectations. I expected some sort of Bond-in-space nonsense that would have been a desperate attempt to add some new interest to the same old espionage Bond story. Ultimately, however, Moonraker is a surprisingly good installment in the Bond series, although a good portion of the film is filled with the same old garbage. The opening theme song is just as bad as they are in every single Bond film ever made that is not The World Is Not Enough, but then again, this is the 1970s, which is probably the decade that is associated with horrible music more than any other decade. The opening action sequence of Moonraker is a very honest attempt and almost stands as one of the better ones of the series, except that there were several things that were just done horribly wrong. Jaws, for example, saved Bond's life when he shoved him out of the plane after the bad guy, because it's not like he was going to go up to the cockpit and grab the controls, which had just been all shot up. The fight scene on the plane was boring and ineffectual, and the skydiving itself, although thankfully much of it was real footage, was screwed up, especially in the way that Bond kicked the bad guy and managed to send him sailing helplessly across the sky.
The role of women in Moonraker was also something of particular disappointment. It is only minutes into the movie before Bond gets onto a helicopter piloted by some air-headed brunette, and then when he goes looking for Dr. Goodhead (not quite as creative as `Pussy Galore,' but still ridiculous to the point of being offensive), he finds her and comments, `A woman' Yeah, good observation, idiot. And then you have the fact that for the first couple of times that Bond meets with Drax, the film's villain, he is introduced to two beautiful women, who smile but leave as soon as they are introduced. The film's producers must have had a bunch of women standing around and they just wanted to throw them into the movie somewhere. There is also a scene where Drax has one of his female assistants killed by dogs for revealing information to Bond, and this scene is inexplicably drawn out with slow motion photography and lots of unnecessary footage of her running through the woods while the dogs chase her. This is so inappropriate that the entire scene looks like it was supposed to have been in a different movie, but mistakenly was left in here. And lets not forget that, in a goofy romantic scene, this woman had revealed to Bond that she had never learned to read. I bet the feminists had a field day with this movie in 1977.(spoilers) Jaws was also given an unenviable role in this installment. Clearly, he is not the most attractive guy, but in Moonraker, he is particularly ill-used. The cable car scene, for example, was one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in a Bond film (particularly Jaws' cartoonish jump from one cable car to the other), although it doesn't even compare to the idiotic idea of having a semi truck do a wheelie in License To Kill. And Jaws sure does have some bad luck in this movie. His ripcord comes off in his hand while skydiving in the opening scene, leaving him to fall into a circus tent. And can I point out that he fell out of a plane and came to no injury whatsoever? It's never explained how he avoided getting hurt in that scene, he just showed up again later in the film. And then the steering wheel of the boat comes off in his hand during the boat chase, leaving him to go over the waterfall and onto the jagged rocks below, yet he managed to miraculously avoid injury again. But I actually liked the way that Bond turned Jaws against Drax near the end of the film, turning him into a good guy, although I really hope that someone was fired for the idea of having him and a tiny tiny pig-tailed blonde girl fall in love and live happily ever after. That was ridiculous before he managed to pick a bottle of champagne and a couple of nice champagne glasses out of the rubble near the end of the film.And of course, at the end of the movie, Drax explains his outlandish plot to destroy the human race and replace it with his own perfect race with a bunch of his own chosen Adams and Eves, in true Scooby-Doo form. But it was a pretty impressive scene when they were chasing down the nerve-gas-laden globes near the end of the film, and the special effects (except the lasers) in the excellent final climax were very impressive. Also listen for the musical code to get into Drax labs in the middle of the film, you may recognize it as the tune that was played back and forth between the humans and the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and we also see the origin of that hilarious tiny camera from Austin Powers in this film.There is a scene here where Bond turns a canoe into a hovercraft that is able to move along without any fans, there is a fight scene between Bond and some sort of samurai that is a pathetic excuse to break a lot of stuff, and as is usually the case, the villain girls always mean to kill him but wind up sleeping with him. This is just an example of the crap that fills this and most other Bond films, but Moonraker manages to get past that and come through with a relatively interesting story. Nothing spectacular, but Moonraker is good for a Bond film, which is especially impressive because it stars the worst James Bond ever",Moonraker
64,GOWBTW,"Out of this universe, this movie rocks!",10,11 September 2014,"Ever since Roger Moore has taken the reigns of 007, he has been making some progress on Ian Fleming's character. This time, he meets Dr. Holly Goodhead(Lois Chiles), and the return of of ""Jaws"" from ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" Jaws(Richard Kiel, 1939-2014) is out for blood against Bond! After the failed parachute attack, he comes to help out a modern day Nazi named Hugo Drax(Michael Lonsdale). Jaws comes into place following Chang's(Toshiro Suga) fight against Bond which resulted in his last concerto. Holly Goodhead on the other hand is a CIA agent, who is helping Bond tracking down Drax. Not only Drax is a very rich man, he is also wanting to repopulate the Earth with his perfect specimen. So he hijacked his own shuttle, goes out in the jungles of Rio to find a rare orchid to wipe out mankind. So when Jaws is recruited, he ended up with a small blonde named Dolly(Blanche Ravalec). Even though, he has her, he still wants a piece of Bond, one way or the other. However, when he was in space with everyone, he felt more like a pawn than a partner with Drax. So he switched alliance, and become a hero. What was more touching, is when Jaws was able to find his small love, he grabs a bottle of Bollinger and says to her, ""Well, Here's to us!"" While he starts a new life, he helped out Bond for the last time. It's a great movie there. I enjoyed every minute of it. Jaws got redemption, no more killing for him there! Bond is at his usual self you know, Being a ladies' man..... A glass to you Richard Kiel. R.I.P! 5 stars!",Moonraker
65,elshikh4,MoonCracker: or The Easy Art of Writing Scripts !,2,15 August 2009,"There is a near unanimity that dear Roger Moore's movies of James Bond were the weakest. Unless the nostalgic feel and its power; with catching them in cinema at their first releases while you were a kid, watching them in TV with your buddies, renting them while your honeymoon (before the divorce!).. Please, SAVE ME THE TROUBLE THIS TIME!I believe the 1970s wasn't a very happy decade cinematically. And most of Moore's movies as Bond were not smartly made (polite word for perfectly cheesy!). His movies, so their makers, failed in creating powerful conflicts or solid chimera; to make you watch and enjoy. In this movie for instance, it's like watch and enjoy being stupid!It was a shock to me when I read that (Moonraker) was the highest grossing Bond movie up until the release of (GoldenEye - 1995). How is that?! Is it the effect of (Star Wars) global mania at the moment? Is the movie that good and I didn't notice? Is this piece of info originally right??The formula is on, but not working. It's classically episodic, but in the wrong way. The plot is idiot; making everything desultory and trivial. The naivety overran everything this round, even the entertainment itself. The hyped action killed the story, if there was any. And the whole thing ended up as just many action sequences run non-stop like diverse parts of a TV show concerning stunts, not a movie. I know that this is BOND, but so crumbly and not in its amusing condition.Therefore, all the bad points appears explicitly: Moore is a statue of wax, doing nothing but smiling and acting tense in front of obvious back-projections, and btw.. he looked laughable in the costumes which he wore while driving Moonraker 5! Michael Lonsdale, as the villain, is another statue of wax. His character wants not to takeover the world, but to destroy it for ideal purposes; simply not clearing that act, and its character, well or at all, made it one truthful definition for Absurd! After (Goldfinger), the rich evil man got a silent Japanese killer again. Ok, this became so silly, not to mention boring! The same thing can be said about the number of girls at the evil man's lair, but at least the Japanese killer, in the 1960s movie and this one, had something to do! Jaws transforms from the beast to prince charming SUDDENLY, and I didn't catch on the reason why accurately (Bad Ahmed, I'll never let you watch nonsense again! / No, nonsense is good, that was BAD nonsense!!).One of the most provocative points is when the whole thing turns into just consecutive many attempts to assassinate 007, being too various, too complicated, and too goofy as well. Review with me: A group of killers attack Bond in the canals of Venice (one dressed as a corpse in its coffin??) OH GOD! Bond was in front of you dull people while immovable cases before, so why the preciosity?!! A sniper comes out of a tree?? What a drivel! I couldn't believe them, this is turning into caricature more than thrilling action. The whole Rio's cable-car situation is so fabricated; they want to kill Bond, OK, so they wait till he rides the cable-car, then Jaws gnaws the cable by his teeth?? Now this is concoction at its worst!! WHAT ABOUT ONE LOUSY BULLET FOR GOD'S SAKE?! But hey, that ruins the amusement, isn't it? Though, I know that the amusement already collapses when I find the time to ask such a question!You read that ""With the exception of the title, the character Drax, and a couple of minor elements, this is an original story rather than an adaptation of Fleming's novel"". However, while the plot runs so thin, and the sets grow so big, the unoriginality of the story shows shockingly. Because aside from being devoted to only ""How not to kill Bond"" bland sequences, it has - more than any other Bond movie - too many references to real original movies, to the extent of feeling that this is a parody movie, or a big budget episode of SNL! There is (2001: A Space Odyssey)'s famously used classic ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" played by the bugler at the start of the hunt at Drax's villa, (The Magnificent Seven)'s main theme while Bond is reaching M's headquarters in South America, (Close Encounters of the Third Kind)'s hailing tune as the sequence which unlocks Drax's Venice laboratory's door, not to mention that Tchaikovsky's (Romeo and Juliet) overture is heard when Jaws meets Dolly, or how (Star Wars) break out abruptly at the end, with the laser guns and the same sound effects (How pathetic!).So it's not an action anymore, it's close to a tourist pamphlet (or rather a colorful calendar!), TV show about action, or a spoofing channel, and a climax that needed Mr. Darth Vader with the ""I'm Your Father!"" thing to be complete (Surprisingly, Mike Myers did it, even if unconsciously, in ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me - 1999""!). This wholly as brittle as cracker goes. Being a hit at its time tells you a lot about the low level of the entertaining movies in the 1970s. I felt really foolish when I finished it, to wonder; why God didn't make me a scriptwriter of Bond movies? That apparently was so easy, and so profitable, job to do!Finally, the best about it: Shirley Bassey's Moonraker.. just fabulous. And the worst about it: inserting, very forcedly, product placements while Bond is in action. Obviously, this movie didn't need to be sillier!",Moonraker

After all, Harold Sakata (who played Mr. Job in GOLDFINGER) represented America in the Olympics. What has Richard Kiel (the world-saving cannibalistic serial killer henchman character ""Jaws"" in MOONRAKER) ever done for U.S.? This is the sort of blatant racism--glorifying Caucasians over other Races--of which the tone-deaf James Bond series producers frequently are guilty, since the human rights movement never gained much of a toe-hold in England. While Kiel's ""Jaws"" obviously inspired Michael Tyson (who ate opponent Evander Holyfield's ear during their heavyweight championship bout) and Luis Suarez, the serial cannibal on Uruguay's World Cup soccer team, such a role model is not healthy in the long run. Though some citizens of the 21st Century may stomach MOONRAKER's inane space warfare sequences (which look far cruder than much earlier STAR TREK and STAR WARS episodes), few modern viewers will fail to cringe at MOONRAKER's racist casting stereotypes.",Moonraker
69,drqshadow-reviews,"Dated, Phoned-in and Forced, This is Bond at His Worst",2,22 June 2015,"Bond goes galactic in this crappy, slappy attempt to capture the 2001 vibe without upsetting his usual audience. Those genres make for an exceptionally awkward match under the very best circumstances, of course, and this attempt is far from graceful. Poor special effects and an absurdly loose grasp on physics and technology kneecap the orbital scenes, while a redundant gauntlet of traps and action sets, plus a dry, repetitive bit of recon work, spoils the Earthbound action. It's a bad spy movie, but a terrible sci-fi movie. Bond has never before felt so formulaic and played-out. It seems like the series has blazed through a dozen boat chases by this point, and they all feel like the same scene set upon a slightly different waterway. The random addition of GI Joe-grade laser weaponry, plus a continuing descent into forced, groan-worthy one liners, makes this installment feel like a particularly pedestrian dose of self satire. It doesn't help that the screen is so thoroughly drenched with blunt, obvious product placement, either. A real sellout moment for the series, ditching its soul in favor of an expired, gimmicky flavor-of-the-month that can't even justify its own existence. Worst of the entire franchise?

70,Fluke_Skywalker,Over the Moon,7,3 August 2020,"Over the years I've heard a fair number of fans, casual and hardcore, regard Moonraker as the worst Bond film of all-time. After my most recent viewing I'm afraid I have to disagree. Strongly it turns out.While its reputation is that of a silly space adventure, it actually keeps its feet here on terra firma for the bulk of its runtime. It's not until the third act that we blast off for outer-space, and the film sorta blasts off with it.Roger Moore--never an ace w/the physical stuff--had started to age out of being a convincing deadly secret agent by this point, but he gets a few hand to hand bits here and actually acquits himself pretty well. Bond girl Lois Chiles is an underrated beauty and a capable enough sidekick, though she and Moore share little chemistry, Michael Lonsdale's Hugo Drax is a pretty generic and stereotypical Bond villain, but he works well enough for what he's asked to do. And Richard Kiel is back as Jaws, and he's actually more fun here than in The Spy Who Loved Me.The sets here are incredible. Best in the series in my opinion. And the special effects are just as impressive. The budget here was substantial, and every penny is up on the screen.So yeah, it's a bit silly, but so what?

74,barnabyrudge,The weakest of the Bond films.,5,22 August 2003,"Moonraker is the weakest of the James Bond films. That isn't to say that it is a weak film, just the weakest of the collection. Compared to films generally, it probably ranks as an ""average"". Roger Moore plays Bond for the fourth time, but seems less than impressed with the rather loose, Star Wars-inspired script that he is asked to work with.Bond is asked to investigate the mid-air theft of a space shuttle. He goes to the lavish Drax corporation in search of answers, and discovers that the ultra wealthy magnate Hugo Drax may have stolen his own shuttle to use in an ambitious plot to launch six shuttles filled with ""perfect people"" to a space staion in orbit around Earth, from which he will destroy the lesser folk of the planet with poison-filled probe bombs.The film is silly to the point where it plays more like an out-and-out comedy than an action films with touches of humour. The most embarrasing scene has Jaws (Richard Kiel, from an earlier Bond flick) being kicked in the genitals. We all know that he has notorious metal teeth, but as he is kicked where it should hurt most, there is a loud metal clang, followed by Moore pulling a rather surprised face as he realises that the guy's teeth are not the only thing made of metal! Perhaps this would have made a good gag in a comedy film, but here it undermines the already implausible plot and stretches it to breaking point. Come to think of it, how many would-be fatal accidents does Jaws manage to survive in this film? Certainly too many, including his speed boat surging over a two hundred foot high waterfall, and his cable car smashing into the bay at the bottom at high speed.The title song from Shirley Basset is not too memorable; Michel Lonsdale as the villain is pantomimic; the special effects during the final space battle are somewhat flawed. All things considered, this is definitely the weakest link in the Bond chain.",Moonraker
75,slokes,"Diverting 007, But Not Engaging",5,9 February 2010,"A scene in ""Moonraker"" sums up the whole experience of viewing the film today. Roger Moore, in his fourth Bond film, hangs from the roof of a cable car, gripping the side.""Hang on, James!"" shouts his woman of the moment, Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles).Moore looks up, raising his eyebrow as only he and Gregory Peck can. ""The thought had occurred to me,"" he deadpans.The 007 franchise was hardly hanging on for dear life as the 1970s came to an end. Indeed, the series was never so popular as it was at that time. You wouldn't know that watching ""Moonraker"" today. The film is structurally and stylistically a mess, with odd bits of comedy and logic gaps too large for even seasoned Bond lovers to look past. Yet the film isn't dull in the least, anchored by Moore at his most spry and amiable.A space shuttle has gone missing, and Bond is sent to investigate. His suspicions center around Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), who terminates employees with the aid of Dobermans and seems a little too eager to keep Bond going around in circles - at 20 Gs. With the aid of Dr. Goodhead, a gondola that drives on land, and a camera that sports his 007 logo, Bond finds his way to Drax's secret headquarters - a space station invisible from Earth.Was Albert Broccoli and the production team behind ""Moonraker"" trying to make a Bond comedy, or just mimic ""Star Wars""? Broccoli claimed ""Moonraker"" was not like ""Star Wars"" or ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind"" because his film was ""science fact, not science fiction"". Well, there are no aliens in ""Moonraker"", but there is a space station that somehow got built in Earth's orbit without anyone noticing. I call that fiction, and not very good at that.Drax is jolly fun as played by Lonsdale as a very different kind of Bond villain. He's very dry, pretty unflappable, and gets off some killer lines. ""Your desire to be America's first woman in space will shortly be fulfilled,"" Drax tells Goodhead as she is escorted to an airlock on the space station, one of several fantastic sets designed by the great Ken Adam.Chiles is a strange Bond Girl, her inexpressive face and atonal line readings suggesting a kind of covert protest by the actress at her character's off-the-charts double-entendre of a name. Faring worse is Richard Kiel as Jaws, as bad here as he was great in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" due to some unfortunate softening of the once-deadly henchman-for-hire. (I did think his new girlfriend was cute, though.)Director Lewis Gilbert liked spectacle - his three Bond movies all feature big-battle finales on giant sets. But he never took Bond seriously, and this time the condition seems to have been contagious. ""Moonraker"" gets by on the strength of Moore's ability to play well against the inanities around him, and occasionally throws a scene at you good enough to make you wonder about what could have been had here with just a slightly straighter approach.",Moonraker
76,I_Ailurophile,007 does sci-fi - poorly. Very poorly.,3,7 August 2021,"This is bad. This is really, really bad, and frankly, 'Moonraker' is worse than I remember from the last time I watched it.Most of the action sequences are wholly beyond belief. A chase set in Venice is one of the most preposterous scenes of the entire franchise, highlighted by an arbitrary shot of a dog bearing a seemingly skeptical expression, and horrid, schlocky editing to make it seem like a pigeon does a triple-take. I wish I were joking. I wish I could un-see it.Fight scenes, specifically, are incredibly sluggish and unexciting in their choreography. This goes as well for dialogue, and even the music feels like it's in slow motion. I don't see anyone specifically credited as a fight choreographer, only ""action"" or ""stunt"" arrangers and coordinators; I don't know if the unexciting melee combat is their fault, or the fault of a lack of umbrella oversight. I don't know if the unhurried pace of dialogue is the fault of writer Christopher Wood, or if the slow tempo of the music can be traced to composer John Barry, or other individuals who worked in the sound or music departments. I don't know if all these things are the fault of specific crew, or of director Lewis Gilbert, whose own contribution is film-making that is generally lethargic and very ham-handed.One of the most unconvincing assassination attempts in the series, very early in the film, leaves us wishing that the evil-doers had succeeded in offing Bond just so the movie could have ended right then and there. As much as if not more than any of its brethren, 'Moonraker' is full of kitschy gadgets and vehicles, and ridiculous, eye-rolling womanizing. Cheeky musical cues have been used throughout 007 cinema canon, but they are played up to excruciating exaggeration in this entry. We're tormented with cutesy, ham-fisted references to multiple other movies, and somehow even worse, we witness use of Tchaikovsky's ""Romeo and Juliet"" overture, one of the most substantially overused tropes of TV and film alike. Did no one working on this film have a sense of shame?Speaking of music: Shirley Bassey's titular theme song is the worst of her three contributions to the series, a dull, middling ballad that lacks any hook to grab our attention. I'm truly uncertain if the disco remix of Bassey's song, that plays over the end credits, is better or worse. Meanwhile, the loafing pace of Barry's score is unfortunate, yet in and of itself his compositions are characteristically fine. His music at least makes up for Bassey's in his arrangement of the same chords into his orchestral pieces, and otherwise Barry's work is one of the better aspects of the movie.The contribution of the score is all the more important because I still haven't covered the greatest of 'Moonraker's' many flaws: its writing. Connections between plot points are threadbare and far-fetched, if they exist at all - and too often, they don't. Many scenes and events seem to happen not because they make any sense - not for the narrative, and not in any more general way - but just because Wood's screenplay demands a scene change, or more action. Leaps in logic threaten our suspension of disbelief, and sudden jumps from moment to moment, scene to scene, are a mark against Wood as a screenwriter, against John Glen as editor, and against director Gilbert.Then there's the characters, and the cast. Broadly speaking I'm not sure at which point responsibility for a deficiency should be assigned to a director, a writer, or an actor, but I'm reasonably certain the faults in ""Bond girl"" Holly Goodhead can be chalked up to Lois Chiles. I've seen Chiles elsewhere, and thought she was just fine, but in 'Moonraker' she plays Goodhead with ludicrous casualness. In the delivery of her lines and in her movements, Chiles is so nonchalant that it's like she's not in a Bond film. As a friend remarked, Goodhead and or Chiles seems blindly unconcerned with anything going on around her, even as people are dying and the fate of the world is at stake.At least Goodhead has a motivation, though. Supporting character Corinne Dufour is written as though she has no consciousness, no loyalty, no agency, no thoughts of her own. It's blisteringly, astoundingly awful - yet par for the course in terms of how women were written throughout much of the 007 franchise.It's gratifying, at least, that ultimate antagonist Drax is written well, even if his evil plot is stereotypical supervillain nonsense mixed with all too real eugenicist bluster. Though let's be honest - as shoddy as the screenplay is all around, it's hardly deserving of praise for there to be a bright spot that itself doesn't reach full luminosity.With all this said, I must take a moment to give credit where it's due. While there are a few sparing good aspects of this feature, there's only one that is so much a redeeming quality as to be the lone element that makes 'Moonraker' in any way worth watching. Against all odds, classic henchman Jaws is gifted with the strongest writing of the whole picture. There are small character moments which show Jaws as possessing actual personality and intelligence beyond the incalculable inhuman strength he's previously demonstrated. Jaws has a very real, very surprising character arc - probably the best line in the film - and for that matter, the best delivery of a line in the film. Richard Kiel is given an opportunity to show off acting skills that he's been bulldozed from sharing at any other time, and he genuinely out-acts everyone else on screen, save perhaps for Michael Lonsdale as Drax. One of Bond's best scenes in the flick is an alleyway encounter between him, Jaws, and a would-be Bond girl, mostly because of the rare deviation from the norm (stoic bad guy muscle) that Kiel is allowed to portray as Jaws. Kiel and Jaws are a true delight here, and the one great joy that 'Moonraker' has to offer.I do really like the costume design. Set design is quite fetching at many points. The whole notion of putting Bond in space is inherently silly, but there's no particular reason why it precludes the possibility of a good time. The climax is done pretty well, overall... But then we're treated to an ending so awful - in dialogue, writing generally, and presentation - that it's not unreasonable to yell at the screen in response.This is such a horrid mess.It was about two years ago when I last rewatched it, and now once more. I'm glad to have found the endurance to sit through it all, but I don't know if I can manage it again. 'Moonraker' mostly seems enjoyable only in the sense of knowing something is awful, and coping through the experience by poking fun at it. I think I had previously decided that 'Live and let die' was Roger Moore's worst 007 feature, but I may have to retract that statement - this may actually be worse.It's a shame that the fantastic characterization and story beats offered to Jaws, and the unlikely opportunity for Richard Kiel to exhibit his great abilities, was relegated to a 007 feature this torrid. The performances, writing, direction, music, sound, action scenes, props, editing - almost everything about 'Moonraker' is so abhorrent that it's almost as though it were intended to be a parody of James Bond. But it's not.At length, this is not a film that I can meaningfully recommend. Die-hard fans of the series, or of the cast, may find worth here. And, once more for emphasis, it's a wonder to see Jaws and Kiel at their greatest potential - the only reason I hold this unsightly wreck in as much favor as I do. Yet that contribution isn't enough to save the movie, and I find myself bewildered at the tawdry spectacle I've just observed.Viewers who sit through 'Moonraker' accomplish such a vexing task that to be blunt, I feel like the studios should be paying us to bear it. So for anyone sharing this dubious distinction, I impart those four words that help to make Jaws and Kiel so improbably endearing:""Well, here's to us.""",Moonraker
77,adamjohns-42575,But they are getting better.,3,31 August 2020,"My God, this film was going okay and then it seemed like the writers got stoned and suddenly thought - ""Hey, why don't we give Jaws a girlfriend, that would be good?"" And ""Let's make him a good guy in the end??"" And ""Why not have a laser fight in space? That would be totally gnarly!"" because they couldn't have ruined it more!
A spy story in space could have worked, but they had to take it to extremes and make it silly. Almost as comical as the last three Rogers and that's not what I want from my Bond I'm afraid.
He's actually not too bad in this one and it's nice that the woman was intelligent and not just a face for him to seduce. I also liked the villain Drax, but Jaws is just a gimmick and by today's standard a cheap one.
Overall, the story is too long and has too many things happening, not to mention the fact that you never find out why the first Moonraker was stolen, as all that did was to bring Drax to the attention of James? Even the Shirley Bassey Song was instantly forgettable.",Moonraker
78,a_chinn,James Bond makes a play for Star Wars audience members.,6,17 September 2017,"""Star Wars"" came out two years before this and was a massive hit, so why not give James Bond a laser blaster and put him in space? The answer is because it would be stupid. There are a few memorable scenes; Roger Moore trapped in a g-force simulator, Richard Kiel as Jaws biting everything in sight, and the catchy Shirley Bassey theme song. There is admittedly a lot I like about this Bond film, but it's also represents the beginning of the end for when the series shifted to overly relying on improbable spy gadgetry and far too much humor. ""For Your Eyes Only"" was terrific, but I do think ""Moonraker"" signaled the end of good Bond pictures during the Roger Moore era, most of which only got worse.",Moonraker
79,davidmvining,Another gimmick for Bond,4,26 February 2020,"By my estimation, this is the second Bond movie built almost exclusively around a gimmick. The first was Thunderball and its underwater action sequences. Now, Moonraker comes along as the movie about Bond being in space. It's the sort of ridiculous that should have worked really well with Moore as Bond, but everything up to the point of Bond going into space (about three-quarters of the film) isn't in the spirit that the movie needs.The first hour or so is a serviceable Bond adventure. There's a shuttle that gets stolen right off the back of the airliner that's carrying it, a villain with huge resources and a penchant for attractive women, and a tendentious connection between the events of the prologue and the villain. The action moves from California dressed up like France to Venice to Rio in globetrotting fashion. It's not great, but it's serviceable. Bond digs around, gets almost killed in a g-force simulator, and beds a couple of women. It's standard stuff. Why the villain, Drax, makes trying to kill Bond his very first move is a bit thin, but at least it fits with the format of the genre.The movie kind of falls apart with the re-introduction of Jaws. He is in the opening action sequence (a great sequence, by the way, involving several parties jumping out of a plane and fighting over a parachute), but then disappears until the halfway mark when Drax decides to hire outside help to get rid of the troublesome Bond. In Rio, Jaws shows up and the movie becomes a disjointed series of scenes that have little relation to each other. Logical progression goes out the window, and people start behaving irrationally with curious results.The moment that drew me completely out of the picture was in Rio when Bond and the girl (Dr. Goodhead...hehe) are in a cable car going down while Jaws is in the cable car going in the opposite direction. The car stops inexplicably and Bond says, ""We should go on top of the car. It's safer there."" Now, the reason they go out on top is to have an action scene (filmed alternatively from very far away and closely in really unconvincing medium shots that show our actors in front of rear projection). There's no logic in thinking that it would be safer on top of a cable car hundreds of feet up rather than inside. It's insane.We then get thin excuses to go deep into the jungle while Jaws escapes death for the second or third time, picking up a small woman as a girlfriend for...reasons. Bond and Goodhead escape certain, but easily escapable, death, knock out a couple of shuttle pilots, and then take their place to pilot (without actually doing anything because its automated) the shuttle to Drax's secret space base. This sounds much more interesting than it actually is. It's mostly ridiculous, and not in any sort of fun way. It's ridiculous in a way that just feels confusing.The final half hour of the film finally sees Bond in space, and it's pretty typical Bond villain stuff. Drax explains that he's going to wipe out all humanity with a plant based toxin released into the atmosphere that leaves plants and animals unharmed. He's going to create a new paradise for his bevy of supermen and women. He also explains why he stole the shuttle at the beginning of the film, and it's just the dumbest excuse. He had five shuttles and one of them broke. So, he stole back the shuttle that he sold the US government, attracting all of the attention that unraveled his plan. It's not like he couldn't send these reusable shuttles back to Earth to pick up the missing people if necessary. He's already spending massive amounts of money, so I feel like an extra trip up with an existing shuttle wouldn't be outside of his budget. If he hadn't stolen the shuttle in the beginning, he would have gotten away with his plan. Drax is a terrible antagonist.The problem with the movie isn't that it's silly in tone, but that it can't tell its story very well. It's problems with silliness extend not to visual concepts or double entendres (of which there are many) but in its characters choices and disjointed narrative. Aside from some fun action sequences, mostly at the beginning, Moonraker is a slog and fails to live up to the promise of The Spy Who Loved Me.",Moonraker
80,Weirdling_Wolf,'Moonraker' has a gloriously galactic grooviness all too few terrestrial action films have!,9,4 May 2021,"'Moonraker' is a celestially camp Sci-Spy classic that blasts the earth-bound naysayers into moon dust with its joyful abundance of far-flung, moon-spun, far-fetched fight scenes and its truly cosmic, out-of-this-world score by sonic mastermind John Barry! Some apparently blissless Bond wags have regularly accused Broccoli of 'moonraking' the bottom of the Bond barrel with his 1979 outing, suggesting it to be a star bore, but I sincerely feel that 'Moonraker' has a gloriously galactic grooviness all too few terrestrial action films have! So don't be a cynical Sputnik, ignore all the negative comets, as Lewis Gilbert's star-studded 'Moonraker' is a stratospherically sensational, Van Allen belter of a spaced-out spy yarn, let heroically handsome space captain Roger Moore and his space-slinky starlet Lois Chiles put a rocket in your pocket as they boldly go further than ever before!

81,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Visually stunning, but vapid",4,23 July 2013,"This one ignores about 99.9% of one of Ian Fleming's best novels, and emerges as being nothing more than a silly Star Wars rip-off, as Bond tries to locate a downed space shuttle after an alleged accident, and stumbles on to a plot to annihilate the human race.The modelwork during said hijacking of the Moonraker is well done, and the opening free-fall is quite well done, until Jaws starts flapping his arms trying to fly, in a really lame comedy attempt. After that dynamite opening, the film is carried through its first half almost completely on the strength of Roger Moore, and some incredible sets, and spectacular on-location photography in Venice.The only elements of the book which make their way into this film are the title Moonraker, and the names of the characters Hugo Drax and James Bond, (but the characters themselves are completely different) and one vague reference to playing bridge with Drax.The leading lady's name is different, but the character actually seems a bit similar to the character in the book, being very cold, or at least indifferent, especially towards Bond. This was both beneficial, and detrimental to the film.The boat-which-turns-into-a-hovercraft was a needless gimmick, followed by an even lamer double-taking-pigeon. Several kung-fun elements appear, and feel like hangovers from 1974's The Man With The Golden Gun, and the brief boat chase and hang gliding scene are remnants of 1973's Live And Let Die. Bond's fight in the glass museum is like something out of an old Three Stooges short film from the 1930s, but that's NOT compliment in this case. But the following fight in a clock tower was considerably better. One of the few highlights to this movie.Mostly this film manages to coast along as far as it does on Roger Moore's charm and some spectacular on-location photography.Jaws was just ... I mean, ... what the bloody hell were they thinking with that character this time around? Turning him from villain's henchman into an ally was an interesting idea, and his fight with Bond on top of the cable car was another highlight of the movie for me, but for most of the rest of the character's screen time is nothing more than unfunny comic relief.Some of the most obvious product placement (Marlboro, British Airways, and especially 7up) is crammed in here, with all the subtlety of a rat jumping out of your underwear drawer.By the second half, my interest was waning. One of the lesser Bond films in the series.",Moonraker
82,brando647,James Bond...in Space!!!,6,1 April 2015,"I can't hate MOONRAKER. I know it's got some major issues but it was my first ""classic"" Bond movie. I still remember getting it on VHS when GOLDENEYE made me curious to see earlier 007 films and, as a younger kid, I was drawn in by the promise of James Bond in space. MOONRAKER is Roger Moore's fourth film in the franchise and, after putting together the excellent, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, I guess everyone decided they could slack off a bit for the next installment. Released in 1979 on the heels of the release of the original STAR WARS, the producers decided to add some ""science fiction"" into the mix to capitalize on the popularity. Keep in mind I use the phrase ""science fiction"" here as loosely as possible. The movie starts with the mid-air hijacking of a space shuttle off the back of a jumbo jet transporting it across the Atlantic, setting the film's events into action. James Bond is assigned to investigate the shuttle's disappearance, starting his investigation at the facility where it was constructed. The millionaire industrialist who's company created the Moonraker shuttle, Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), doesn't seem all that concerned with the missing spacecraft and immediately goes about instructing his personal henchmen to kill the British agent. So, right off the bat, we've established the villain and eliminated any mystery there. With the aid of the supposed NASA scientist Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), Bond will follow the clues to Venice and Rio de Janeiro as he pieces together Drax's evil scheme.What I find most interesting about MOONRAKER is how my taste has changed in the years since I first saw it. The movie is sort of split into two major parts: the secret agent action here on Earth and the third act set aboard Drax's private orbital space station. As a kid, I loved the space action and found myself bored with everything that led up to it. Now it's the opposite. I actually really enjoy the first two acts of the movie and dread everything after the shuttles launch. I'll admit the movie has serious tonal issues. It can't decide if it wants to be a more serious spy/action movie or a parody of itself. I'm not going to lie and say I don't like the goofy bits though. The movie brings back Jaws (Richard Kiel) after his popular introduction in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. He's not as much the stone cold killer this time around. I guess the moment in the last film where he dropped a sandstone block on his foot got a lot of laughs because he spends most of MOONRAKER finding himself in zany predicaments (i.e. going over a waterfall or free-falling with a busted parachute) and mugging for the camera. I can't hate it though. Jaws has been one of my favorite characters since I first saw this movie years ago and, while I love the stone cold killer version better, I'm fine with the punch line version too.The real issue with MOONRAKER is how fast it hits the brakes once we leave Earth for the big final act. You know we're in for trouble when the initial journey to the space station feels like forever (think: the initial Enterprise reveal in STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE but not quite as excessive). The filmmakers were proud of their initiative in sending Bond to space and their special effects so they make sure we have plenty of time to soak it in. Whenever there's no gravity, everyone starts moving incredibly slow becauseI dunnoouter space. And if you don't get enough time to appreciate the outer space effects on the trip up, don't worry. There's a long, dull space laser battle to really drive the point home. I'll give them credit; the effects aren't that bad. I actually like the look of it all. I just wish the filmmakers weren't so proud as to forego keeping the action interesting. Space marines floating around, exchanging laser fire (seriously, lasers) with Drax's personal army, and spinning off into the distance whenever they're hit. We're treated to a handful of those shots as men are zapped into oblivion. With my newer perspective, I can see it all for the pandering that it is, trying to rake in a buck after STAR WARS, but I still find it fun. Roger Moore is a good blend of serious and goofy. Jaws is still awesome. And Michael Lonsdale is great as Drax, growling his lines ominously and only ever raising his voice once over the course of the film. He's a soft-mannered, well-spoken sort of megalomaniac. I could see him cracking my top-ten list of Bond villains.MOONRAKER is a weird little anomaly in my 007 fandom. It's obviously not a great film but it's far from the worst of the franchise. It's got some heavy nostalgia behind it for me and, even setting that aside, there's enough here for me to enjoy. The casual fan? I couldn't tell you how well it'd sit with them but I know I'll be busting it out once a year to revisit Bond's adventure into orbit.",Moonraker
83,Gislef,Thought I would give it a try...,3,8 December 1998,"I read the reviews here, saw that some people actually liked this, and thought, ""Hey, maybe I'm misremembering it.""  So I watched it.  And...sorry, Moonraker is still a pretty sorry excuse for a Bond movie.  There are some chilling moments (the dogs in the woods, the fight scene in the clock tower).  But Richard Kiel and the writers seem to think Jaws is Wile E. Coyote - other than one suspenseful moment (as he stalks a woman during Carnival in Rio, dressed in a clown outfit), he brings unwanted humor to every scene he's in, non-demonstrating the same light sense of humor he brought to such classics as Eegahh and The Human Duplicators.  Despite the producers alleged claims of wanting a ""realistic"" space station, laser pistols make loud whoosing noises and fail to even singe the shirts of the people being shot down.  Most irritating of all, Bond stops the station's rotation by hitting the big red ""Emergency Stop"" button the bad guys put him next to.  Roger Moore is adequate, Lonsdale-as-Drax is downright chilling, and the fight and chase sequences, but there's a general feel of ""been there - done that"" to the whole thing which, along with the plot holes and comedic elements, just doesn't jibe.",Moonraker

If it's '69 you were expecting me.""",10,6 August 2021,"Connery's bond would have went into space in You only Live twice if it wasn't for that slip up Blofeld noticed, however, Moore's Bond achieved going where no Bond has gone before, but only in the last twenty minutes, not the whole film ( judging by the Star Wars reference, you would think that it features in the whole film). Speaking of Star Wars, Moonraker is partially influenced by its success, but most Bond films have been lightly or strongly influenced by a popular film of the day. The air of kitchen sink dramas of 1960's and the influence of Hitchcock thrillers pervade on the early Bond films, or TV series like the Avengers on the likes of Goldfinger.The story - James Bond is called in to investigate after an Anglo-American ""Moonraker"" space shuttle disappears during a routine test flight. His mission takes him via Venice to Rio - pursued by the metal-mouthed hitman Jaws - then into the depths of the Amazon jungle, on the trail of evil billionaire Hugo Drax.Yes, Moonraker is the most outlandish, cartoonish, overtop Bond extravaganza replete with some crazy moments such as the double-taking pigeon, but that's part of this film's appeal. However, this is all balanced out by some dark elements such as Hugo Drax setting his Doberman Pinchers on his secretary for betraying company secrets, unwitting scientists are gassed to death inside an airtight room, Jaws ominously dressed as a clown almost biting Manuella's neck, and the subject itself - creating a perfect human race in space - has echoes of Nazism. So it's not all fun and games. Matter of fact, the first hour and half is typically serious Bond plot with Bond investigating, breaking into a safe, learning about the lab, etc. Only after an hour or so the reins are really set free and it's fun to the max, continuing with plenty of puns, action( a stunning cable car sequence with Bond hanging to dear life, a speedboat chase in Brazil, to name a few), and an impressive special effects of space - the production design is simply sublime. The laser action sequences are in tradition of Bond finale - the good guys coming to the rescue at a lair- and that deadly globe almost entering the earth atmosphere is a showstopper. As in Bond tradition, which features a dangerous creature/animal, there's a python that has a huge crush on Bond.Roger Moore as 007 is at the top of his game, oozing confidence and elan. His one liners are delivered as smoothly as ever, but he's also driven, wily, and dedicated to the mission as ever. His fight scene with Chang is quite epic and hard-edged -and that opening freefall sequence is exhilarating and possibly tops the Union Jack parachute jump in TSWLM. That centrifugal scene where Bond is taken on a spin is proof that Roger is a very good actor, and the look he gives Chang afterwards says ""the game has just begun.""Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead is a strong character, not instantly cooing over Bond, and rebuffs his advances. Hugo Drax really makes a cold, deadpan villain that has some sublime one liners (""You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season."" "" Look after Mr. Bond. See that some harm comes to him.""), spoken in a monotone voice. Richard Kiel is back as jaws, putting his teeth to good use, though he shows a soft side, falls in love, and helps Bond in the end - the latter makes sense as Jaws doesn't measure up to Drax's idea of a 'perfect race', something the wily Bond uses to his advantage.The title track sung by Shirley Bassey ( her third Bond song) is suitably dreamy and enchanting.I was one of those who once thought this was the weakest Bond film, but it has won me over, with its grandiose charm, unbridled aim to entertain like never before, fantastic globetrotting locations, and great action scenes that seamlessly appears in between an energetic plot. Most of all, though, Moonraker, like other Roger's Bond film, are full of flavour, pizazz, exotic locations, elan and energy. It's the ultimate escapism from an increasingly turbulent world - something we won't see again. That's why I'm always eager to watch it and allow it to ""take me around the world one more time.""",Moonraker
86,pyrocitor,Bond in space = BAD IDEA,2,20 May 2006,"Although a constant element in the James Bond franchise is a lack of credibility, and steadily more unbelievable villains and fiendish plots, Moonraker took this way too far with the decision to bring Bond into space. As a result, Moonraker is by far one of the very weakest 007 installments ever - bluntly put, a foolish concept terribly executed in pretty much every aspect. The turgid script is cringe-worthy, even for a Bond movie, and each action set- piece seems dull, poorly executed and just plain uninspired, with the exception of the airborne parachute battle between Bond and steel toothed villain Jaws (Richard Kiel), the high point of the movie. Then after the credits, we move into a just plain silly plot of an industrial extremist and fanatic Hugo Drax (Michel Lonsdale) who is determined to wipe out the world's population and collonate the moon with his own master race. Even for Bond, the idea of global genocide from space is just plain ridiculous. Later comes the inclusion of dull and completely unnecessary love interest Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), perhaps one of the least interesting or even attractive ""Bond girls"" ever, and other useless and yawn-worthy supporting figures. It is great to see the return of antagonist Jaws, who without words easily outshines Lonsdale's painfully bland and completely menace free ""villain"" Drax. The film also marked the last appearance of beloved Bernard Lee as Bond's superior ""M"", and he is given a bit more to do for his last time around. But Kiel's appearance is easily the film's highlight, and even Roger Moore doesn't seem to be in regular form as 007... perhaps he had the foresight to read the script and realize what a terrible movie he was attaching himself to. All in all, Moonraker seems like a painfully bad, fan made interpretation of a Bond movie. Director Lewis Gilbert tries far too hard to maintain the spirit of his previous film, the excellent ""Spy who loved me"", and instead serves in essentially pantomiming all the elements that made all the other Bond movies so great. Moonraker drags along, with absolutely no excitement or enjoyment derived from the feeble action sequences, or the boring, completely unthreatening villain, or the tasteless and pointless love interest... or pretty much anything, other than Richard Kiel's wonderful Jaws character. Avoid Moonraker at all costs, unless a genuine die hard Bond fan, in the truest sense of the term, or one searching for a cure for insomnia.-2/10",Moonraker
87,Maciste_Brother,The most visually striking 007 ever made,7,17 June 2007,"Of all the Bond films, MOONRAKER is, imo, the most visually striking of the entire series. It looks like it cost a billion bucks to make. The sets by Ken Adams are amazing (he should have won an Oscar for them). The locations are stunning. The fx are well made and still hold up today. The women are above average gorgeous (they all look like supermodels before supermodels were in). All of this beautifully filmed by cinematographer Jean Tournier. I love watching MOONRAKER just because it's so damn gorgeous to look at. I don't know how many times I saw it at the movies when it came out just to appreciate the beauty of it all. Unfortunately, we are talking about a James Bond film and of course there has to be the usual formulaic stuff seen in every other James Bond film. Basically, MOONRAKER is a remake of YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. I always preferred MOONRAKER over the schintzy SPY WHO LOVED ME, which was made just before this one. Lewis Gilbert directed those three Bond films and MOONRAKER is his crowning achievement. Personally speaking, Gilbert is a bad director. His films are always bloated and sorta soulless and yet still gorgeous. Aside from his Bond films, he rarely made an impression with his other films. In fact, he's the one who directed THE ADVENTURERS, which is a good looking film but it's really, really awful. I'm glad Gilbert stopped making Bond films. He was always too laid back for action films like this.There ARE a lot of memorable scenes in MOONRAKER: the entire intro is now a classic and much better than the one in SWLM. Corinne being chased by dogs. The simulator scene. Bond fighting with Chang in Venice. My favorite scene is when Bond and Goodhead are stuck below a shuttle's rockets and are about to be burned alive. A near perfect action moment there. The climax in space is fun if improbable. I love the scene when they have to destroy those globes as they re-enter the atmosphere. Really suspenseful. But as good as those scenes are individually they almost don't register as a whole because the story and direction are so lackadaisical, so relax. It's like everyone was on vacation. There's absolutely no grit to this film. It's really sleek and smooth but nearly bite-less. The whole story seems to be just a preamble to the action set in space. What really stands out about MOONRAKER are the many long moments with no dialogue. I'd say about 50 to 60% of the film has no dialogue. Just music and sound effects. It's almost a silent film. Moore didn't have a lot of dialogue to remember and this was an easy film to dub. The story is as easy as connect-the-dots: The British owned Moonraker 5 disappears in mid-air and 007 is sent to California to investigate its disappearance. At the Moonraker plant in California (France really) Bond find blueprints of vials which leads him to Venice, where the vials are fabricated. And from Venice Bond goes to Brazil where the vials, filled with deadly nerve gas, are shipped to the underground layout of Drax (boringly played by the usually reliable Michael Lonsdale. Love the name ""Drax"" though). Oh and we learn that Drax wants to create a new race of super humans by killing everyone on earth by dropping those nerve gas filled globes from space while Drax and his super humans reside in Drax's space station. I actually like that part of the story and some of the grandeur of it (Drax wanting to be God) is actually achieved with the striking visuals and the amazingly lush score by the brilliant John Barry. Unfortunately, again, this is a James Bond film and thought provoking ideas are set aside for formulaic action. I wish this wasn't a James Bond film. Take away all the Bond elements, the stupid humor, flesh out the screenplay and this would be a spectacular kick ass science fiction film.Anyway, back to James Bond.I really like Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead. She's my favorite Bond girl ever. Beautiful and sophisticated but tough. She's no bimbo. I remember a lot of my friends in school didn't like her because they thought she was too tough for a babe. I guess Holly Goodhead was Girl Power before Girl Power was in. For me, Chiles epitomizes everything chic and sexy about the late 1970s. She's unforgettable in that black jumpsuit. But the Holly Goodhead role is a really badly written one. She's almost an afterthought to the whole story. They basically needed a character to fly the space shuttle and Bond into space (something 007 obviously couldn't do) and Goodhead was basically that: just a pilot. Then there's Corinne Clery who is truly gorgeous but sadly, again, her role is minimal. Then there's the not so beautiful Jaws. Jaws was so popular in SPY WHO LOVED ME they brought him back here. I don't mind this but they turned him into a good guy and he even falls in love with a ditsy girl. This part of MOONRAKER is *really* bad. Someone should completely edit that storyline out of the movie and its rating would go up exponentially. And like in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, the musical in-jokes were needlessly distracting.These bad aspects about MOONRAKER are almost negligible though because the film is such a visual (and aural) feast. Whether it's one of the best or worst of the series, I really don't care. I can positively state though that this is THE best looking Bond film ever, with an actually cool science fiction story somewhere in it. I give MOONRAKER 10 stars for the look of it all but 5 stars for the laid back and sometimes silly direction. So an average of 7 stars.",Moonraker
88,Sirus_the_Virus,It's not even a bad film.,9,9 September 2009,"I think that Moonraker is a lot of fun that is really underrated. Everyone gives it such a low rating. I actually sat back and enjoyed the film quite a bit. Bond travels quite a bit in this film, to some places even I have been to. Like there is one scene where is kicking some Chinese guy's ass in Venice. I have been to Venice and thought it was the best place I went to on the Europe trip. Moonraker is just trying to entertain and it succeeds. I didn't think it was as good as The spy who loved me but I still thought it was a great film. The only problem I have with it is the scene where they are in a lazer fight in space. I just found that a little silly. But other than that I was pretty happy with Moonraker. Moonraker is a fun film that I appreciate but nobody else does. I was happy to see that Jaws(Richard Kiel) returned again. I think that Moonraker is actually better than some of Sean Connery's. I am not going to give my rating out of 4, because like with Live and let die, if I give my rating out of 4 there will probably be an angry mob. I had fun with Moonraker and I think that you should see it.",Moonraker
89,jeremycrimsonfox,"Underrated, If Not Perfect",7,14 December 2020,"The fourth of six Bond films with Roger Moore as the secret agent, Moonraker is one of the less popular films. In it, after a Drax Industries Moonraker is hijacked and destroyed mid-flight, with the shuttle missing, M sends James Bond to investigate. However, after being nearly killed by Hugo Drax's henchman, Chang, he soon discovers a plot by the businessman to poison the Earth so he can repopulate it from a space station. James Bond must stop Drax's mad plan, even when Jaws, whom Bond has faced in the last movie, is hired as bodyguard.The James Bond films released before 2006's Casino Royale were always known for being more over the top, and this one takes the cake, as it basically has Bond in space (in fact, For Your Eyes Only, the movie after this, was supposed to come after The Spy Who Loved Me, but MGM saw the success of Star Wars and made Moonraker while delaying For Your Eyes Only in order to cash in on it). That shift would basically result in the negative reception it received when it was shown in theaters (and even be parodied in movies), but the movie does have some good scenes (like the pre-credits scene where Bond fights with an unknown villain for a parachute as they are falling). Also, Jaws is turned into more of a comedic villain, but the story is good and fits in with the over the top style of classic Bond, and the actors all do a good job.",Moonraker
90,Joxerlives,The ultimate Moore formula Bond and my joint favourite,10,4 April 2014,"Moonraker is hugely divisive amongst Bond fans, loved and hated in equal measure. I absolutely love it and proudly had the Moonraker shuttle, laser gun (which unfortunately only fired caps) and Drax corporation helicopter in my toy collection (oddly the shuttle has a satellite in its' cargo bay which doesn't feature in the film, I'd have preferred some tiny space marines. The helicopter fires missiles which also doesn't feature in the film but that's because it's Naomi's gunship from 'The Spy who Love Me' repainted).Speaking of which the parallels between 'Moonraker' and 'The Spy who Loved Me' are striking but the later film takes its' themes and style to the most extreme degree imaginable. Considering it was the late 70s the special effects really stand up, especially when you think that at the time the real space shuttle had yet to fly. The end space battle and shooting down of the nerve gas filled globes are still thrilling over 30 years later as is the scene in the G-force simulator. Brilliant Bond girl in Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead. Anya in the last film was good but she still ended up being rescued by Bond from Jaws on the train and in the finale is tied to a chair in a sexy outfit being lustfully molested by the villain. Holly is a different kettle of fish altogether, from Bond being surprised by her in their meeting she never needs rescued once and is more than a match for him, not least that she can fly a space shuttle and he can't.Michael Lonsdale is an excellent villain as Drax and gets most of the best lines, I'm especially fond of 'Look after Mr Bond, see that some harm comes to him'. All told, I think this may just pip it's illustrious predecessor, the only downside being from this point there was no way they could top it in terms of sheer spectacle. 10/10",Moonraker
91,Beta_Gallinger,"Certainly not all bad, but still one of the disappointing Bond films",5,25 August 2008,"I don't know what people might think of me reviewing one of Roger Moore's Bond films on Sean Connery's birthday, but I assure you, it happens to be a mere coincidence that I'm ready to review ""Moonraker"", starring the second long-term Bond actor, today. Anyway, this was Moore's fourth James Bond film, after his first two, ""Live and Let Die"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", which I think are pretty good, and his third, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", which is slightly better than its two predecessors, in my opinion. However, I think this fourth outing of his in the Bond movie franchise is inferior to all of the previous three.While headed for the U.K., a space shuttle called the Moonraker is mysteriously hijacked! Who is sent to investigate this deed? Well, James Bond, Agent 007, of course. His mission takes him to the Drax laboratories, run by Hugo Drax, where he meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, a CIA agent and NASA astronaut, who has been sent here to investigate. Bond also sees some suspicious activities happening in the Drax laboratories, and faces a killing attempt! After this, the mission takes both Bond and Goodhead to several different places in the world, and eventually, somewhere out of the world! Unfortunately, Jaws, the giant, strong henchman who can kill people by biting them with his metal teeth, is back, now working for somebody else, and he will make this mission more difficult (like he did with Bond's last mission), appearing in a number of different places! In Roger Moore's first three outings as Bond, I've found excitement and humour. In ""Moonraker"", I once again found both of those, but certainly not as much. For example, in the scene where Bond is in the G-Force simulator, spinning faster and faster (an attempt to kill him), it starts out exciting, but is too long, with the simulator just rather gradually picking up speed more and more. Humourwise, there's the scene where Bond takes M and the Minister of Defense to the lab. All of them enter in gas masks, but it turns out that the lab is no longer there, and Drax acts puzzled as to why they're wearing those masks. While I did find this one mildly amusing, I couldn't figure out why I didn't find it funnier. Like certain other Bond films, tediousness is a problem in this. Also, they decided to bring back the Jaws character, and while he was good in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", he may get tiring in this movie, though some surprises involving him come towards the end, some of them mildly amusing, silly surprises, though some might not like them. What other problems can I think of? Let's see, the way the movie goes from the opening sequence to the theme song sequence confused me a bit, and that may not only part. Bond films are known to have silly aspects, but I think this one has more than usual.I'm not sure how much it's the film that caused me not to like it so much, or the fact that I was in a rather tired state when I watched it. However, it appears it has less appeal than all ten of the official James Bond movies that preceded it. I may have been more impressed if I had more energy while I watched it (I'm not 100% sure), but probably not by much. I'm sure I still would have found significant problems in it. 5/10 is the vote I gave for ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (George Lazenby's only outing as Bond), and ""Diamonds Are Forever"" (Connery's last stint in the role in the official franchise), and I give ""Moonraker"" the same, though it just might be slightly inferior to those two. In conclusion, this Bond adaptation is one of the weaker ones in my opinion, and on to another subject, although Connery isn't in this film, I am talking about James Bond, so I think it's appropriate to say happy birthday, Sir Sean Connery.",Moonraker
92,vip_ebriega,"Fly me to the moon, Mr. Bond.",7,19 February 2007,"My Take: The comedy is occasionally off, but the special effects and action sequences are terrific. Why do some viewers think this entry in the series is by far the weakest of Bond. I beg to differ, I actually think this is one of the better Bonds with Roger Moore. Despite its occasional decline to over-silliness (even for Bond standards), I actually find it more entertaining than Roger Moore's early entry ""The Man with the Golden Gun"". The plot, which is more like a variation of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (only a little sillier), involves the theft of the Moonraker space shuttles. 007 is sent to Drax Industries, the manufacturers or these shuttles. He soon discovers that the owner, Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) uses this rockets to fulfill his dastardly plans to create another civilization. One of the main reasons that critics mistreat this Bond entry is because it doesn't go with the trend of the other Bonds. MOONRAKER tries to be more faithful to the then-popular trend of science fiction movies (after the enduring success of such classic as STAR WARS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS). Another would be its occasion to go beyond the level of silliness and not knowing when to stop. A humorous moment where Bond drives a gondola with wheels is OK, but it's other scenes like Jaws (Richard Kiel) finding a girlfriend are just too silly. More extreme silliness ensues (there are moments of true high-camp standards here), but as long as the sharp wit, the panache and style made famous by many other Bond films are there, there's no real harm in trying something else to go along with it. Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Moonraker
93,one9eighty,Take a giant step back for Mankind,6,13 August 2020,"Bond 11, Roger Moore's 4th outing.... Shouldn't have been so. ""Moonraker"" was brought forward in the schedule due to the success of ""Star Wars"". In actual fact, ""For your eyes only"" should have been next""... but it what it is so never mind.""Moonraker"" is certainly up there with the more iconic of the Bond films that I remember from childhood. For a starter, it is the one where he goes into Space!! But let us look at some of the other elements that make this film up....Jaws is in it again!Jaws gets a girlfriend (Dolly)Hugo Drax - one of my favourite Bond villainsSpeedboat gondolas in VeniceThe fight in the glass museumBond in the G-Force simulatorJaws + Bond = Cable car disasterSo the plot is this, a space shuttle has been stolen in mid-air. Bond must discover why and who by. This leads him to find a plot for global genocide potentially being perpetrated by the mean and calculated Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale). Bond meets up with Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) who's working on the same case so they eventually pool their resources. While investigating Bond has to survive attacks from Jaws (Richard Kiel) and Change (Toshiro Suga). In order to prevent a global catastrophe Bond must go into space - will he save the day?!From a technical point of view ""Moonraker"" is a decent film, it's just that after ""The Spy who loved me"", it feels a little out of place, a bit more humorous and cartoonish in comparison. With ""Moonraker"", a lot of that realism is blown away - just check out the space infantry fighting at the end of the film to know what I'm talking about. But, in a total contrast to what I have just written, where the film makes up for itself is the lack of realism involved, the humour and the cartoonish approach. IMO it is pointless doing the same thing repeatedly, why not change some things up - and that is certainly what this film does. It gives audiences something absolutely random and demands that they sit back and absorb everything that's going on - it makes the film an immersive cinematic experience - which film should be!! The film is beautifully shot across various locations including Brazil, Guatemala, California, France and Venice the film is stunning. The space scenes only actually account for about half an hour of the 126 minutes given, so anyone that struggles with suspension of disbelief does not have to feel alienated for long.Roger Moore performs really well in this film, there aren't as many lines as he's had in previous outings, but he performs them well. This is testament to the amount of action the film has. The more action, the less time to recite lines. Lois Chiles is Holly Goodhead who is initially working against him but eventually pools resources with him, a good performance from a Bond girl with a memorable name. She was cast to not just be beautiful, but deadly too with brains and determination. In contrast, Corinne Clery, playing Corinne Dufour is just out and out beauty and succumbs to Bond's advances with ease to help move the plot forward. Michael Lonsdale plays Hugo Drax, who for me, is one of the better villains. He is cold and dangerous, and always seems to be a step ahead of Bond. Very calculated with extraordinarily little emotion, he is an excellent foil for Bond's cartoonish and humour laden delivery. Once again Richard Kiel plays assassin Jaws. Under the pressure of fan please to the producers, his casting sees him turn good guy towards the end of the film due to finding love in Dolly (played by Blanche Ravalec). I found this to be a little disappointing but it's not something off putting enough to dwell on. The usual's of Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell return to play M, Q and Moneypenny.If this wasn't a Bond film, it would be a great sci-fi spy adventure in its own right. The fact that it is a Bond film, and there is a space adventure too, meant that instantly there would be detractors. The film has unduly come in for a lot of criticism over the years, and I think unfairly so. It might look a little dated now but in 1979 this was a big budget blockbuster. I say, just give it a chance and enjoy the film for what it is, escapism and fun. There are nods to other films; ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"" to name but two. The opening song is Shirley Bassey who already had some Bond songs under her belt. It was meant for Johhny Mathis, but Bassey's voice was better suited in the end. Directed by Lewis Gilbert, with a screenplay by Christopher Wood, ""Moonraker"" is up there with the best of the Bonds, it's definitely a memorable outing and one I have enjoyed at various ages of my life.In terms of Bond films this is a 7 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 6 out of 10.",Moonraker
94,Holt344,A Bond Classic set in Space,7,29 December 2018,"The movie is silly and the lighter tone worked perfectly when I was a kid and it still works but was too silly. It doesn't feel like a true Bond movie but it's one hell of a entertaining movie, capturing the humor and the action sequences, some of my personal favorites but the showdown was a let down down, I expected more to it. My memory played tricks on me.
The villains are good, Jaws is one of my favorite henchmen and Drax are good but not perfect. The highlights of the movie are the stuntwork, visual effects and the characters. The locations are once again great, beautiful sets and scenery. This movie is pure joy, entertaining, shouldn't be taken as a serious Bond movie.",Moonraker
95,ivo-cobra8,Criminally underrated Roger Moore's James Bond 007 flick my second favorite,5,5 November 2017,"Moonraker (1979) is criminally underrated and bashed by Bond fans and I know everyone is going to disagree with me. This is my second favorite James Bond 007 film and in my opinion not yours Roger Moore's best film. This is the eleventh spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the fourth to star Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. The third and final film in the series to be directed by Lewis Gilbert, it co-stars Lois Chiles, Michael Lonsdale, Corinne Cléry, and Richard Kiel. This film has so much action, action, action, action all the time. It has beautiful girls, climatic battle fights with laser guns in outer space, Bond jumps off the plane without parachute. Climatic fight between Bond, Holly Goodhead and Jaws on the Cable Car in Sugarloaf Mountain, Rio de Janeiro. I love this film to death I grew up with this film and it is my favorite. I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that even the late Roger Moore is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond.Since I was a kid I have really enjoyed this film, I have enjoy it in high school and I still do till it's day. I know a lot of people's is at least favorite Bond film because it is science fiction film it is set in space. James Bond 007 in outer space is a bad idea because in 1977 Star Wars come out and they were so popular that they decide to make this film, I don't mind it.James Bond investigates the mid-air theft of a space shuttle, and discovers a plot to commit global genocide. Roger Moore in my opinion is the most underrated James Bond 007 ever and I have more respect then i would have a respect to a morons like Daniel Craig I hate the new James Bond! Roger Moore R.I.P. I really miss you I am long time loving fan of you. Thank you for your visiting Slovenia in 2000 I have so much respect for you. My condolences to his family.Star Trek was so popular even the movies and the show and I don't like em I hated the reboot they made and I still hate Star Trek movies but I love this movie so much it is in space like only 45 minutes and even that wasn't that bad.This is the sequel to The Spy Who Loved Me Richard Kiel reprise his role as Jaws from the film The Spy Who Loved Me and it was the last film Lewis Gilbert directed. Jaws returns in ""Moonraker"" and adds some tension to the film Richard Kiel has become something of a cult figure since his appearance in 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. He reappears as indestructible as ever. His performance was beautiful and wonderful even for the comedic effect than in The Spy Who Loved Me.Why is my favorite and why I love it so much: I love the filming locations the film was set from California to Venice, Italy to Brazil Rio de Janeiro to Amazon River to Drax base in Iguazu Falls I love this film. This movie has so much beautiful girls you see so many blond girls in this film I feel like this movie set Supergirl. You have a great boat chase on the Amazon River it is fantastic Bond blows up the assassins with a mine. Bond fights with a python in the river Drax's base. Honesty I think Conan The Barbarian copied from this movie the scene about Python fight. Bond fights off Drax henchman Chang (Toshiro Suga). Bond throws knife in the assassin in Venice river and flees with his own boat.Great direction from Lewis Gilbert I am so proud on the director that he filmed this film in Venice, Italy in the city in which my mom visited. Great music score from Shirley Bassey - Moonraker and John Barry did a wonderful score for the James Bond film.Michael Lonsdale's performance is astonishingly controlled and precise as Hugo Drax... There's something really scary about his true personality and character... He gives sarcastic remarks about 007: 'You appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season.' 'At least I shall have the pleasure of putting you out of my misery!' 'Mr. Bond, you persist in defying my efforts to provide an amusing death for you.'Lois Chiles is a great and the finest Bond girl, the irresistible Holly Goodhead: A CIA agent and astronaut who joins Bond and flies with him to Drax's space station. She was really sexy and beautiful all tough I prefer Drax's astronaut girls way better cause they were so blond.10/10 Moonraker to me is way better then Skyfall, Spectre, Quantum of Solace, The World is not Enough, Die Another Day, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and even more Bond films I dislike. This is the most underrated film I have ever seen.10/10 Grade: Bad-Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Eon Productions, MGM/UA Communications Company Starring: Roger Moore, Lois Chiles, Michael Lonsdale, Richard Kiel, Corinne Cléry, Toshiro Suga Director: Lewis Gilbert Screenplay: Christopher Wood Producer: Albert R.

96,eminkl,Worst of the entire franchise? It's certainly in the running.,3,18 April 2020,"Bond goes galactic in this crappy, slappy attempt to capture the 2001 vibe without upsetting his usual audience. Those genres make for an exceptionally awkward match under the very best circumstances, of course, and this attempt is far from graceful. Poor special effects and an absurdly loose grasp on physics and technology kneecap the orbital scenes, while a redundant gauntlet of traps and action sets, plus a dry, repetitive bit of recon work, spoils the Earthbound action. It's a bad spy movie, but a terrible sci-fi movie. Bond has never before felt so formulaic and played-out. It seems like the series has blazed through a dozen boat chases by this point, and they all feel like the same scene set upon a slightly different waterway. The random addition of GI Joe-grade laser weaponry, plus a continuing descent into forced, groan-worthy one liners, makes this installment feel like a particularly pedestrian dose of self satire. It doesn't help that the screen is so thoroughly drenched with blunt, obvious product placement, either. A real sellout moment for the series, ditching its soul in favor of an expired, gimmicky flavor-of-the-month that can't even justify its own existence. Worst of the entire franchise? It's certainly in the running.",Moonraker
97,The_Movie_Cat,Carry On Roger,7,31 July 1999,"This 11th Bond movie continues with the traditional British ""Carry On"" style, where a whole host of double entendres make up for any discernible plot. Whether it's 007 kicking Jaws in the crotch to a metallic clang, commenting on the size of Q's balls (""Bolas, 007!""), meeting Dr. Goodhead or even Q joining in on the act with the infamous ""I think he's attempting re-entry"", then this one covers the market. Even a harmless pigeon is edited to double-take at one of the silly chase set-pieces.Of course, this film set a few precedents for the series. Where the film was intended to utilise an original screenplay (For Your Eyes Only), this was put on hold due to the success of Star Wars, et al, and the works of Ian Fleming were drawn on for a final time. Chronologically, this was the earliest Fleming novel to be reworked as a film, barring Live and Let Die, coming from way back in 1955. Unfortunately, for the film series this follows You Only Live Twice (written 1964), giving the impression to a film audience that Moonraker was the derivative of the two.Commercially, however, none of this really mattered, Moonraker taking $87.7 million gross and becoming the highest-earning Moore. Statistically, though, increased production costs (the movie was rightly Oscar-nominated for its visual effects), mean this was only just over 2.5 times what it cost to make. In comparison, the low-key Dr.No grossed over 22 times it's actual budget.I once bought a cassette of Bond themes. Not chronologically ordered, it is telling which of the themes appear on side two. While the much-loved but execrable ""Goldfinger"" tried to rhyme ""resist"" with ""mist - er"" (and what is a ""coldfinger"" anyway?), I actually found the theme to ""Diamonds Are Forever"" very pleasing. ""Moonraker"", Shirley Bassey's third and final theme for the series, is arguably the most forgettably bland ballad in existence.Yet for the continuation of Moore in the role I've actually developed a theory that helps make him more palatable. I believe 007 suffered a minor nervous breakdown after the death of his wife in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". This would go some way to explaining Connery's out-of-character turn in ""Diamonds"", and give reason why Roger acts like such an insufferable pratt. The state of his mental health has obviously taken an upturn for this film, as Roger is nowhere near as annoying as he was in the previous two movies. (Though this may be due to the fact that Moonraker gives him some real dialogue, and not just 100% puns). Even so, there are times when that eyebrow of his rises so far on his head that it appears to hover, Saint-like, above him.On the subject of dialogue, the two henchmen roles are filled by the (almost) mute assassins Chang and Jaws. This may add menace in a less jocular film, but isn't this really just a lazy characterisation to give the dialogue writer an easy time? Michael Lonsdale does okay-ish as the chief villain, Drax, though the increased stunts mean he never gets to generate the required gravitas that prior enemies had in abundance.Moonraker is rated as one of the worst Bond movies, and while it IS awful, from the scene irrelevancies to the sloppy science (I still can't believe they shot a scene with 007 increasing his velocity in free-fall), it is by a small margin an improvement on the last two entries. Where ""Golden Gun"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" had pretence at being greater than the sum of their limited parts, Moonraker is wholly aware that it is shallow, badly-written tripe of the highest order. And on that level, it is entirely enjoyable.",Moonraker

The good points are few here,with Roger Moore doing his usual credible job as Bond,and Michael Lonsdale gives a stout performance as villain Hugo Drax.It certainly lacks in all other areas,I feel,with the worst of it coming in the form of the return of Jaws(Richard Kiel),as he seems somewhat out of place in the story line,and immersed in an incredibly sappy love story,which could ruin your memory of the bad guy we loved to hate in The Spy Who Loved Me.Overall,this movie has the feel of a middle-of-the-road B-movie.Not worthy of your time.",Moonraker

In this film the series has abandoned any sense of realism in the vein of an espionage thriller. The film is a sci-fi adventure. As such it is fairly entertaining although Mr. Moore is starting to show his age at this point and believability already on the wane is really stretched here. The Bond girls here are not in the top tier in my opinion. Jaws a formidable opponent in Spy is a caricature in Moonraker and Drax while not as bad as Kananga is far from anything approaching Scaramanga. Still the sets and special effects were quite good for their time and overall one feels he reached a reasonable degree of escapism for two hours. On the other hand the series, after the highlight of Spy, is starting to have an eerie feeling of creekiness and it's not just coming from Roger Moore's knees! 6/10",Moonraker
104,Hayden-86055,James Bond blasts off from reality,5,16 June 2020,"Moonraker is such an odd title, it was obviously just an attempt to cash in on Star Wars but even so it has some inventive moments. The first half is the good old fashioned formula and is actually fairly decent, whereas the second half is where it starts to go off the rails: Jaws falling in love, laser fights in space, one scene cuts from Bond escaping a baddie ambulance to the next shot of him somewhere in Mexico riding a horse, and then we're treated to a boat chase in the Amazon about 3 minutes later. It's all very muddled and the plot starts to go a bit crazy.The action is decent enough and Moore is charming as ever. The music isn't bad and has some nice elements, although the theme tune is a bit naff.

105,timdalton007,Bond In Space...,3,2 October 2006,"With the success of the 1977 Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me, producer Albert R. Broccoli, director Lewis Gilbert, executive producer Michael G. Wilson, and screenwriter Christopher Wood began work on the next film, For Your Eyes Only. But with the success of Star Wars, United Artists and the Bond creative staff choose to send 007 into outer space with an adaptation of Ian Fleming's third novel, Moonraker. It turned into one of the biggest missteps in the history of the series, that while it was a box-office success, it has become one of the ""black sheep"" of the series.Roger Moore's performance in this film is filled with his strongest attribute: humor. Throughout Moonraker, Moore is spiting out one liners at every possible opportunity. This leaves Moore in sleepwalking mode. Once in the film does Moore show any vulnerability and that's in the film's most effective sequence: the out of control centrifuge sequence. He is battered, lucky to be alive, and suspicious of everyone at Drax's plant. Because of the film's lack of character depth and a focus on humor, action, and special effects that ruin the film's main character and what should be the focus of the film.The lack of character depth continues on the film's leading lady, Holly Goodhead. Her introduction at the plant and her action before, during, and after the centrifuge sequence show her to be a mysterious and possibly threatening figure. But from the point that Bond meets her in Venice till the end of the film, Holly comes across as an emotionless ice princess. While intelligently written, Holly Goodhead is one of the most forgettable Bond Girls of the series.Of all the main characters, perhaps the worst of all is the villain, Hugo Drax. He is an aristocrat held in high regard by the whole world, stands (or rather sits) back and issues orders, and gives some of the worst lines ever delivered in the entire series. Michael Lonsdale is a fine actor but this badly written role is only further ruined by Lonsdale's low key style of acting.The supporting cast is good. Get beyond the disastrous return of henchman Jaws, which is only behind J.W. Pepper in LALD and TMWTGG in terms of cringe worthy comic relief, and the waste of a character that is Manuela, you have some good things to say. The film's best character is Drax's assistant Corinne Dufour. Her death in the forest at the teeth of Drax's dogs is only the second scene in the film to have tension. Drax's servant/henchman Chang is a much better character than Jaws and is the only one of the villains to have any menace and it is another shame that he's killed after the film's best fight sequence. As for the staff at MI6, Bernard Lee gives his best performance as M in a decade, Desmond Llewelyn gives a good performance as Q and gives the film's best line and Miss Moneypenny is once again given a massively down graded part.The action in this film is a mixed bag. The mid-air fight in the teaser is one of the best teaser sequences to appear in a Bond film and is just behind the ski jump in Spy, but it is ruined by the appearance of Jaws flapping his arms trying to land on a circus tent. The boat chase in Venice is rather bland and stoops down to the boat chase in TMWTGG, even copying it at times. To completely ruin it, the gondola hovercraft. The series is nothing like reality most of time, this is one of the cases where it stooped lower than the deepest spot on the ocean floor. Anyway, the fights in the film outside the fight in the Venice museum are worthy of a B movie rather than a Bond film. The boat chase in the Amazon is a great action sequence and is one of the easiest to watch of the film's action sequences. Even the battle on board the space station is lacking what made similar sequences in other films so memorable. The film's last action sequence has Bond trying to blow up a globe containing poison with a laser, proof that this film was doing it's best to copy Star Wars as this scene is just like the famous finale of that film minus ""Use the force, Luke."" The sci-fi element of the film is what ruins it. The whole plot of stealing a space shuttle and the space station that can't be seen on radar are among the worst ideas to ever appear in a Bond film. The battle sequence and the finale sequence, as I discussed above, are all you need to realize that while Broccoli was aiming for ""science fact, not science fiction"" the film is sci-fi. If you need logic, avoid this film like the plague.If there is a bright spot in this film its John Barry's score. The score is never played for laughs and helps to add some much-needed tension to the film, particularly during Bond's sneaking around Drax's plant in Venice. The action music makes some of the series best use of the James Bond Theme and the romantic cues are very fitting. But the score doesn't quite seem up to par with his other scores. The main title theme is another classic from Shirly Bassey, though not as good as Goldfinger or Nobody Does It Better. But there is also the use of the Close Encounters Of The Third Kind theme, The Magnificent Seven theme, and other music is cringe worthy at best and proof of the emphasis on humor.Even with a decent supporting cast and a good score, the film is hampered down by bad main characters, mixed action sequences, bad humor, and overly sci-fi elements, Moonraker comes off as the third worst film of the series.",Moonraker
106,Bogmeister,BOND#11: 007 Zooms into Orbit,6,22 June 2007,"MASTER PLAN: Eliminate the human race (with a toxin derivative of orchids, no less) and start over with a new master race. Bond finally makes it into outer space, a dozen years after just missing his chance in ""You Only Live Twice."" Capitalizing on the success of the previous ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and taking advantage of the recent sci-fi craze following ""Star Wars,"" the producers ended up with the most financially successful Moore Bonder, but the positive aspects pretty much end there. There is a fairly exciting theft of a space shuttle in the beginning and the rest of the teaser is great - a flabbergasting use of skydiving to create a special thrill - but even here, it ends on a disquieting note: returning giant henchman Jaws, mugging for the camera, is made to look like a clown as he falls on top of a circus tent. Singer Bassey returns for the 3rd time to sing over the credits (after ""Diamonds Are Forever"") and it's her least effort. With the same director and a few other elements duplicating the better stuff of the previous Bonder, there's a 'by-the-numbers' feel to the storyline. Even worse, there's too much tongue-in-cheek, with Bond grinning away many of the threats to his well being and almost winking at the camera. When Q presents Bond with his latest gadget (a wrist gizmo which fires darts) in M's office, it comes across as perfunctory, almost tedious, and even laughable considering all the high tech weaponry we see later. This was, by the way, actor Bernard Lee's final performance as M.Bond's mission takes him to California at first, where the main villain has seemingly transplanted a big chunk of France to set up his own private kingdom (it's actually filmed in France, natch). This sequence expands on the usual master villain's domain premise, going all the way back to the first one, Dr. No, and very similar to Stromberg's lair of the previous film. The villain has unlimited funds (it's mentioned that he even purchased the Eiffel Tower) and so much money has apparently gone to his head in a very bad way. Later, of course, we see that his domain has been expanded beyond even the constraints of the Earth and his master plan denotes an ego of monstrous proportions, making even Hitler look short-sighted in his ambitions, yet there's no sense of actual megalomania which we've come to expect of Bond's top nemesis. It's telling that the only really threatening scene here involves a couple of trained dogs. Bond then travels to Venice, Rio de Janeiro (where there's another action scene very high up on a couple of cable cars), the Amazon jungle and, finally, into orbit around the Earth, being dogged by Jaws and a few other minor henchmen most of the way. Most of the chasing involves water sports, such as in the canals of Venice and on the Amazon River; rather than a gimmicked auto, Bond employs souped up boats in this one. Rather than sharks or piranha, Bond tangles with a snake in the water, a misconceived and pointless scene (there has to be a weird animal threat, based on previous Bonders). His ally, a female scientist/covert CIA agent (Chiles), continues the liberated woman concept begun in ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" The problem here is that Chiles' line delivery is very flat, somewhat robotic, as if she were reading her lines off a script placed just off camera. Maybe the actress was nervous, being in her first big blockbuster role.But, the problem extends to the other major roles, as well, including master villain Drax. The actor Lonsdale has been superb in many other roles (as in ""The Day of the Jackal""), but here he is very stiff, in monotone, as if someone was pointing a laser gun at his head during his acting scenes, threatening to pull the trigger if he dared to emote even slightly. In fact, he seems quite bored during the entire movie; this suggests an intriguing concept, that the villain has decided to change the world simply because he's bored with the whole thing, but, unfortunately, the boredom attaches itself to the viewer. By contrast, Stromberg, though not the most colorful of villains, at least suggested a necessary mania to convey why the world must be altered in his godlike view. Worst of all is the revised approach to the brutish Jaws character, who behaves more and more like a buffoon as the film progresses, rather than the scary killer of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (the only bad guy to be brought back from a previous Bonder, this seems, in retrospect, an error). Especially cartoonish is his mortified expression at the end of each fight with Bond, as he heads for another painful disaster. It reaches Monty Pythonesque proportions when Jaws meets his new lady love, recalling scenes from the James Bond parody ""Casino Royale"" from 1967. The whole thing ends up on a huge space station, with a battle now parodying blazing laser guns of conventional sci-fi pictures. This station was meant to be a modern Noah's Ark, with a group of couples meant to begin a new human race, but I think Drax and his scientists overlooked the limited genetic variation of such a small start-up; all these perfect specimens either disappear or are killed in the finale - it's a sign of the film's weaknesses that I didn't pay much attention to this. Moore, just past 50 at this point, looked good for his age, but he probably should have been retired after this one. He, as Bond, would return in ""For Your Eyes Only.""

107,rossrobinson,good,10,15 June 2004,"Moonraker was made in 1979, the last movie of the 1970's, i thought it was a good movie to watch, i thought it was great to see Jaws back in the movie. Roger Moore is a fantastic actor i think but i think Sean Connery is the best james bond actor ever than the others who took the part as playing james bond. Roger Moore played james Bond 7 times as he took over the part of playing james bond in 1973 after Sean Connery. His first james bond movie to starr in was Live and Let die, which was released in 1973. The next one was the man with the golden gun which was released in 1974. The spy who loved me was his 3rd bond movie which was released in 1977, Moonrkaer was of course the next title which was released in 1979 (the last in the 70's) for your eyes only was the next one, the first in the 1980's, this one was released in 1981, the next one was octopussy which was released in 1983, the last james bond movie roger moore did was a view to a kill which was made in 1985.

Goldfinger got nothing on this.Remake this today!",Moonraker
109,Rickting,"Bond goes into outer space, but in terms of quality this is a submarine",3,1 September 2015,"Moonraker, which is linked to the far superior novel in name only, follows Bond as he tries to stop another super villain plot. This adventure will take him all over the world and finally into space. I hate Moonraker. OK, maybe hate is a strong word but it's one of my least favourite Bond films by some distance. The fourth outing for Roger Moore is the first time the series went completely into unbelievably stupid territory and it never looks back. Some will enjoy this. There's nothing wrong with Bond films being light hearted but they need to be fun as well and this one just isn't. The special effects are genuinely good to be fair, while the opening skydiving sequence has more thrills than some action films have in 90 minutes. The final battle is entertaining as well. As always there's an enjoyable sense of escapism and it's a more feminist outing with a strong Bond girl and the final scene is a bit low but undeniably funny. Despite this, Holly Goodhead isn't one of the best Bond girls. She maybe a stronger character but Lois Chiles... has a worse actress ever appeared in a Bond movie? Roger Moore is still awful as Bond, while Michael Lonsdale is half asleep as the main villain. Jaws is turned into a joke, one of the many cringe worthy and face palming comic moments throughout Moonraker. Aside from the opening and ending there isn't really any exciting action. It's all flatly filmed and uninteresting. The scene where Bond drives a gondola through Venice is a real low point. The Bond films have always been ludicrous but this is going to the levels which Die Another Day would go to. The script is ludicrous, filled with cringe worthy comedy and despite the madness still fails to actually be any fun. Ian Fleming is nowhere to be found here. Well that's to be expected as this is hardly a Bond movie. It's a badly acted science fiction comedy bomb which is a total space shuttle wreck of an action film. It's boring, it's not funny, it's foolish. It's more ludicrous than Bond going into space, fighting a laser battle and defeating a villain with a ludicrous plan to create a new super race with a dart. Wait hold on... oh.3/10",Moonraker
110,grendelkhan,Even Bond wasn't immune to the effect of Star wars,6,27 November 2012,"In 1977, Star Wars (and Close Encounters) exploded into the public consciousness and changed movies forever. It raised the bar for spectacle and special effects. It helped create a sci-fi boom and even EON rushed to cash in on its success. Now, James Bond was going into space! After The Spy Who Loved Me, we had been promised For Your Eyes Only, but instead we got Moonrake. Why? Because it has space, sort of, in the title. The original novel was about a Nazi with an ICBM. That was then, ICBMs were old news after Cuba. So, let's launch James Bond in a space shuttle, before Nasa had even done so.The film starts out oddly, with the hijacking of a space shuttle. This requires a bit of suspension of disbelief, as it is unlikely that a space shuttle would be carrying any fuel, while being transported on the back of a 747. So, we turn off our brain and move on to Bond. He seems to be returning home when he is set up to die in a crashing aircraft. What follows is an amazing aerial sequence that includes the return of Richard Kiel's Jaws. As the film moves on, it is mostly in good form, with menace around every corner and more than a bit of mystery. Unfortunately, it starts coming apart at the seams when the comedy takes over. Just as things seem to be building to something big, we get the ridiculous gondola chase through Venice and a double-take from a pigeon. Add to that a turn from menacing to comical for Jaws and you have the makings of a big disappointment. Once things go into space, they never recover.The cast is rather uneven. Michael Lonsdale is excellent is Drax, a cold, ruthless maniac. His assassin Chong is up there with the likes of Oddjob. However, Lois Chiles is totally unconvincing as Dr. Goodhead, a name straight out of a porno. Richard Kiel proved popular as Jaws and returns to early menace; but once a love interest for him is introduced, he never recovers.The film really could have worked if they had stuck with the stronger elements. The scenes in Drax's mansion and testing facilities are great, as are those in the glass museum and the Amazon. The locales of Venice and Rio are used well, and the mystery of the deadly liquid is very intriguing. The space station is another matter, as are the jokes. It would have been more believable that Drax had built the complex with NASA's knowledge, though he hid its true purpose. Perhaps it was intended as a weapons platform, or a lab, ala Skylab. Drax then hides his deathsattelites onboard, ready to rain death upon the land. Drax and his followers would then be isolated in the Amazon, in bunkers, waiting for the virus to finish its job and expire. Instead, we are left to believe that he built this massive complex with neither NASA's or the Russian's knowledge. It makes the volcano lair of SPECTRE look like an average real estate venture.So, despite a promising start, we are left with a battle in space. I suppose it's in keeping with the tradition of ninja commandos attacking a volcano base, or scuba commandos battling beneath the ocean, but it looks far less believable. Then we get the same gag at the end, with Bond's version of coitus interruptus, as we saw in TSWLM. It pretty much signaled that any attempt at a serious film was over, for now.",Moonraker

Moonraker tries to take on Star Wars, but does not succeed at all. However, saying that Moonraker is a Star Wars-clone can be very misguiding, because most of the movie takes place in normal Bondish-locations. The action is good, but what makes this movie worse than most of the others, are the sloppy space-scenes during the last 30 minutes of the movie.

Moore seems quite comfortable in his role as well, delivering just the right performance whether it's action, seducing women, or having non-verbal encounters with the henchman. Granted, Bond can work as a more serious film, as we saw in ""For your eyes only"", but on the spectacular side of the spectrum ""Moonraker"" finally delivered the ultimate experience. Those who find the film too unrealistic or outrageous fail to understand that at the end of the day Bond IS an outrageous character, and so are his antagonists.

You must agree it sound a bit far fetched? Not very realistic looking either. The model work is good i must say but sometimes does look faulty.Shirley Bassey returns with her third Bond theme, but unfortunately this theme doesn't live up to the exposure the others have. John Barry returns with a hardly memorable score. There are a few good action scenes, but most seem be have already been overuses, such as the third boat chase to be seen in a Roger Moore Bond film.

115,jhaggardjr,007 goes to outer space!,8,16 December 2001,"""Moonraker"", the 11th James Bond adventure, is probably the most sloppily made 007 movie to date. Many consider this to be the worst Bond movie (others may say ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" or ""A View to a Kill"" as the worst). Well I'm a huge fan of the series and I've pretty much enjoyed every movie, including ""Moonraker"". This joyfully silly adventure has our favorite British spy (Roger Moore) investigating on why a space shuttle was hijacked. This investigation takes Bond first to California, then to Venice, then to Rio de Janeiro, and finally climaxing in outer space. ""Moonraker"" has alot of good things going for it. The action and special effects are fine (if a bit tacky at times). Bond gets a good female companion in Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), and 007 crosses paths once again with that steel-toothed villain Jaws (played once again by Richard Kiel, who played the character in the 007 movie before this one, ""The Spy Who Loved Me""). However if their is one objection that I have to make about ""Moonraker"" that would have to be the main villain Drax, played by Michael Lonsdale. This has got to be the dullest Bond villain so far. I was constantly laughing at this bad guy whenever he talked in the movie. Hahahahahahaha! Aside from that, ""Moonraker"" is a fun 007 adventure. Not one of the best in the series, but out of the 19 007 movies in the series to date, it lies somewhere in the middle.*** (out of four)",Moonraker

I'm sorry is this a James Bond movie or a Austin powers movie?.The story is about Mr. Bond himself in space as the secret agent is on the trail of a missing space shuttle that leads to a plot to no less than global genocide by Hugo Drax, who has his own plans for civilization.This has to be the most cheesiest and the most gooiest James Bond film I've seen out of them all. The visual effect's at times can looking good, but most of the times it looks out dated. I loved the character Jaws. I though he was pretty awesome in the other Bond films, but here he falls in love... wait WHAT?!.The good things about the film: Roger Moore once again does a fine job playing Mr. Bond. The theme song was nice to listen to, even when it's not the best theme song for a James Bond film, but I still found something to like in it. And the movie may be a comedy at times with it's cheesiest, but I still enjoyed those parts of the film because it's very rare to see that in a James Bond film.But overall Moonraker is a straight up goofy ball with a plot that goes nowhere, and a boring main villain.

117,dfle3,Thunderball in space...James Bond in the 25th century...Moon Wars...,8,12 August 2010,"11th of 23 Bond movies.This is an entertaining movie but it sort of comes across as a futuristic reboot of the franchise...it's perhaps best to see it in that light, but there are some recurring characters which tie it closer to the time...which is unfortunate, as pretty much the most annoying thing about the movie is the Star Wars style laser guns, which feature later. It's anachronistic. However, since 1977's ""Star wars"" movie soon became the highest grossing movie of all time, it's perhaps unsurprising that this Bond film borrowed some ideas from it...with regard to weapons and setting.Bond formula: Exotic settings - U.S.A, Venice, Rio de Janeiro and...outer space! Plot - A space shuttle manufactured by Sir Hugo Drax's Drax Industries disappears. The pre-title sequence shows what happened here. That sequence is what made me refer to this movie as ""Thunderball in space"" in my header...there is an equivalent sequence to this in Sean Connery's turn as Bond in ""You only live twice"".Anyway, Bond must investigate the circumstances of the shuttle's disappearance.Gun barrel sequence...check.Pre-title sequence - The greatest to this point, in my view...and quite possibly the best ever in the franchise. It really defies belief! Main title theme song - One of the great elements of Sean Connery's incarnation as James Bond was the great Shirley Bassey singing the theme song to some of his movies. ""Le grande fromage"" returns for one last great song...perhaps her best in the series. It's beautiful. Hal David wrote the lyrics.Q - Usually not much to say about the man, as I don't usually include what technology he provides to Bond in my reviews. However, I must say that Q's line right near the end of the movie is killer! He usually doesn't get that sort of quality dialogue!Silly female names - Dr. Holly Goodhead work for you? Sexism - Check. Bond is paternalistic here, at times. There is a good, awkward moment between Bond and Goodhead when they first meet. She has some good lines to use on him! Bit of a war of the sexes here.Wine snobbery - Check. Bond says ""Bollinger. If it's '69, you were expecting me!"". Hmm, seem to recall reading somewhere that that the wines that Bond values in the movies aren't really that well regarded by real wine connoisseurs! End teaser...check.Things of interest: * Sir Hugo Drax is one of the better Bond characters...he has some marvellous lines to Bond...like the one about Britain's one indisputable great contribution to Western society...afternoon tea! Ouch! * Animal lovers take note...some pheasants are shot in this movie as part of game hunting...but it's OK...Bond was shooting them in self-defence! * If by this movie you can't spot the product placement, you really must get your eyesight checked! * Bond comes across as a little bit creepy at times in this movie...sort of a stalker...which isn't really very spy-ish. Other aspects of his spy 'technique' seem to leave a little to be desired too! * Not that Connery's Bond films were never silly at times, but here the comic book aspects are magnified and amplified...Q Division is in hyper-drive and Jaws is more of a comic book creation here...listen for the aural hint that Jaw's teeth aren't the only things made of metal on his body! * General Gogol returns in this movie.Notes to self - * big words I do not understand...bolas/vassar funambulists.* Is this true?...the orchidea nigra was worshipped once? Stuff about sterility...caused by this plant? * re gravity...20g is apparently fatal. 3g is what astronauts launching into space experience. At 7g most people pass out. Bond experiences at least 14g. That's a memorable scene...nicely done...wonder how they done it.This is a good, entertaining movie, but I get the feeling that the comic book aspects to it may alienate some people...not me, so much.",Moonraker
118,willcundallreview,A solidly OK-ish piece,6,7 May 2014,"Rating-6/10Moonraker is a Bond film which is although far from the best, and far even from Moore's best but still manages to entertain and can be enjoyed quite a bit(if you ignore the absurdities). With a good cast and a villain that was wasted though, Moonraker is a film that will split peoples decision and some will also love it. I felt it was solidly OK- ish and maybe moving towards being OK, and here is why I felt that about it.The story is fast and fun and although of course is a more silly, outlandish Bond plot, it can still be thoroughly entertaining. The pace is slow and takes a little while to really get stuck into the plot nevertheless it could be rewarding for some, I meanwhile felt average on that point. Finally on plot it is crazy at the end now I won't tell you, but Oh my it truly is crazy and you may see what I am talking about, it dragged it's mark down considerably which was only about a 5 minute scene.Moore is fun of course and does what we always expect from him with his humorous performance and light hearted action, he manages an OK job, even among all the excess mess. The rest of the cast do not do that well really and although I did feel it was poor that wise, they manages to not destroy this film. Finally on the characters the villain named Drax was actually kind of a good bad guy and managed even with his bad acting performance to feel sinister and a good example of how to portray super villains.The script is poor and very much overly trying to be humorous and just ruins the dialogues too. Directing is also poor and both contribute to the more poorer scenes, but they don't really affect it much. I did enjoy the gadgets with some cool contraption being made by not just Q but also Drax who's safe I felt was a piece of art(in film). The cinematography wasn't too bad either and with some great shots of the second half of the film, it looks pretty good along with the ridged plot.The film is pretty poor though and most of is ridiculous, although I did say it was entertainment and that is what it is. The things I have already criticised are it's main bad points and not much else has to really be said either but if any little extra points have to be put down it is in the sense that the film continues it's point of making Bond much more lighter since Connery left his role as Bond.Bond series film fans should enjoy as always but I believe most won't find this there favourite one of all time with it's crazy plot, even for Roger Moore as Bond!. You can enjoy it I know it and I did too but it seriously isn't near being a straight good film, could be the worst of the Bond series but that is up to you, but maybe a heads up for those hoping to watch all the Bond's, Moonraker is not up to scratch.Overall a 6/10 meaning Solidly Kind of OK and with some fun parts like I was saying, it can be entertaining for those willing to just let themselves go and stop thinking about what secret agents really do in this world. I feel a good point about this is it's craze with space as Bond has never been and a Bond hasn't been set there either but it is interesting to see the sets used in space here which do turn out well, they actually possibly make the film just a little tiny but better.",Moonraker
119,majikstl,"""Take my unfinished life and make it complete""",6,2 July 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how MOONRAKER rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: MOONRAKER: Apparently a ""moonraker"" is the tallest mast on an English sailing ship, or, according to a folk legend, one who foolishly strives to attain the unattainable, i.e., to rake in the moon. Which one applies here is debatable, but, poetic symbolism aside, either way it does give THUNDERBALL and A VIEW TO A KILL a run for their money as the worst Bond title. 2 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: One disabled plane, three men and two parachutes -- you do the math. One of the better stunts in the Bond film, though largely irrelevant to the rest of the film. 8 points.Opening Credits: Though Maurice Binder seems to be trying to suggest weightlessness, his sexual gymnastics here seem heavy handed. An apparent homage to Superman flying seems oddly out of place. Okay, but nothing special. 5 points.Theme Song: The melody is haunting and the great Shirley Bassey is back for a third time to deliver the seductive lyrics. Unfortunately, Hal David's lyrics aren't all that seductive -- you try writing a song called ""Moonraker."" Though it's no ""Goldfinger"" or ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" still it sets a romantic tone; though the disco version of the song tacked on at the end is a bit dubious. 7 points.""Bond, James Bond"": Roger's interest in the character seems to ebb and flow -- the better the story, the better his performance. Since so much of MOONRAKER is according to formula, he seems to be merely going along for the ride. 7 points.Bond Babes: Corinne Clery is served up as this film's sacrificial lamb and gruesomely murdered (by attack dogs) for no apparent reason. That leaves Lois Chiles as the Bond Girl du jour (Dr. Holly Goodhead, no less) and one can pass the time deciding if she is less convincing as a rocket scientist or as a CIA agent. In fairness, Chiles has a fresh-faced all-American charm and she banters nicely with Moore. 8 points.Bond Villain: It is said that James Mason was offered the part of maniacal billionaire Hugo Drax and it is a pity he turned it down. One can just hear his contemptuous, world-weary voice saying a line like ""Mr. Bond, you persist in defying my efforts to provide an amusing death for you."" Instead, Michael Lonsdale announces his plan to destroy the world with all the enthusiasm of a bureaucrat announcing the implementation of a new accounting system in his division. Really, they should make all Bond villains watch a few Vincent Price movies so they can get an idea just how to play a villain with style. 5 points.Bond Baddies: When Drax's favored samurai assassin, Chang (Toshiro Suga), is quickly dispatched by Bond, he is soon replaced by Richard Kiel's Jaws, who apparently needs the work, having been left unemployed at the end of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. Jaws is a great henchman, but he seems plugged into this film more as a stunt than for any real purpose. Then, along the way, Jaws falls in love and sorta, kinda turns into a good guy! It's a strange twist and I am not sure if it is supposed to be a joke or what. Very odd, but at least his return is more welcome than a reappearance by Sheriff J.W. Pepper. 7 points.Sinister Plot: It's almost a remake of the last Bond epic, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. In it a mad billionaire wanted to destroy the world and repopulate it from an underwater colony; now a mad billionaire wants to destroy the world and repopulate it from an outer space colony. A submarine is stolen in the former and a space shuttle in the latter and both open with stunts involving parachutes. Again Bond teams with a rival agent from another country and, of course, he even is battling the same assassin. 3 points.Production values: After the lush, romantic style of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, the clean, efficient look of MOONRAKER seems a bit of a letdown. The big battle in outer space, much of it in slo-mo, is especially disappointing, though the battle atop a couple of disabled cable cars is pretty neat. 5 points.Bonus Points: I know that the Bond films are expensive to produce, but if they have to rely on selling out to product placement, can't the filmmakers do it with a bit more panache? For instance, there are three intrusive plugs for 7-Up right in a row, each more blatant and out of place than the last. And we all know that James Bond just loves his 7-Up -- shaken and not stirred. Minus 5 points.Summary: Allegedly, MOONRAKER was rushed into production to capitalize on the success of STAR WARS and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS; they should have waited a few years and worked on the screenplay. It's not a bad Bond film by any means, but it lacks a fresh approach. The Moore films tend to ride a roller-coaster, going up and down in quality. MOONRAKER is a dip between the two best Moore films, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.Bond-o-meter Rating: 57 points out of 100.",Moonraker
120,michaelarmer,Moonshagger,7,28 March 2020,"Not as bad as The Spy Who Loved Me, but not as good as many others. It's not that exciting, the space scenes do not look great especially the space battle, a few silly moments too, such as Jaws flapping his arms like wings and landing in a circus tent in the intro and many errors. But it does have one of the most dramatic deaths when the dogs chase Corinne into the woods. The scenery is nice with some authentic locations, Venice, California and Brazil, but other locations are used which are not, France for the real Chateau, Argentina for the Brazilian waterfall, Guatemala, Florida for the Amazon boat chase which is poor, so only half good. The music is ok, the song is great, Shirley Bassey for the third and final time, what a voice.Roger Moore is ok, not great though, some of his quips are a bit staid. Michael Lonsdale (Drax) although a fine actor is not great here and does not look or have the personality of a rule the world Madman.

121,malkane316,Quick reviews!!,6,14 February 2005,"Probably the worst Bond film until Die Another Day, Bond becomes Superman and Skywalker all in one, going into space to save the planet. Star Wars had just been released, so naturally the Studies felt it was smart to make a sci-fi Secret Agent movie. Too many lasers and jet packs leave fans wondering where Bond would go next. Back in time? Luckily the next film is one of the best.Bond is investigating the disappearance of a space shuttle, and takes expert Holly Goodhead with him. All fingers point at Drax, who it seems, plans to destroy the world and create a new one in space, under his control. There are many good chases here, but it is all spoilt when Bond is fired into orbit. Jaws returns, and is good again, but this falls apart at the end. drax is a good villain, but unfortunately a carbon copy of too many others. Chiles is very good as Goodhead, but there is a lack of other interesting characters. The entire film seems too overblown and lends far too much from other films, meaning that the attempted tongue in cheek nature becomes self-indulgent. However, it is better than people say it is, and does not deserve to be seen as rubbish. There are good points, but they aren't the ones in the spotlight. Q has a brilliant line at the end though.6 out of 10",Moonraker

It's fun, it's not in the least believable and it's full of idiotic details.

125,OttoVonB,"Bond 11: Moore contemplates his fall, and charges on!",5,11 June 2007,"A US space shuttle on loan to the British government is hijacked, setting off a scandal. James Bond (Moore) is sent to investigate, first visiting the megalomaniac plutocrat Drax (Michel Lonsdale), whose conglomerate built the Moonraker shuttle. Yet things quickly turn nasty and Bond runs around the world after clues of Drax's involvement (and his more sinister scheme beyond the hijacking).I consider ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" to be Moore's apotheosis as James Bond. It refined what had been done with the great ""Live and Let Die"" and solid ""Man with the Golden Gun"" and pushed it to extremes, getting the balance of threat and comedy just right. The producers then contemplated their options: more realism, or shall we continue down the escapist parody route? The producers marched on.Of Roger Moore's later Bonds, ""Moonraker"" is still enjoyable, ranking with Octopussy, even though it is a case study of how things went wrong. The villains became blander (as did the ladies, with the exception of Maday), Moore became older, and the action became all the more ludicrous. Grand scale is one thing, but when kitsch gets thrown into the mix, as is the case with the final space battle here, things do not look promising. Effects aside, a less forgivable fault is making Jaws - the metal-toothed colossus from ""Spy Who Loved Me"" - fall in love. It was tellingly followed by an attempt at more realism, ""For Your Eyes Only"" that unfortunately proved lacking in the entertainment department.All in all, the film is not completely woeful, boasting some neat tricks (the cable-car fight, the eerie Michael Lonsdale) despite some jarring faults.",Moonraker
126,mnpollio,Abysmal,2,27 March 2007,"After the success of The Spy Who Loved Me, the franchise took about five steps backward in creating a cheesy entry that competes with The Man With the Golden Gun as the worst in the series.Bond: Moore pretty much always did give his all to the role, but he was a limited actor and never able to elevate an already crummy film. This is no exception.The villains: Michael Lonsdale plays yet another megalomaniac - this one intent on creating a new super-race of people in outer space. He is surely one of the most boring of the Bond villains. Richard Kiel returns as the intimidating Jaws, but plot developments in the latter act pretty much neuter his character.The women: Corinne Clery is lovely in a secondary, short-lived role. Lois Chiles then picks up the slack as an undercover CIA agent. Her line readings have all the excitement value of watching someone read the telephone book.Shirley Bassey returns for the third and final time to croon the weakest of her Bond songs. The film is a mess of cheap laughs, cheesy effects, weak action set pieces and sad attempts to integrate a Star Wars style to a Bond film that never does gel.",Moonraker
127,ExpendableMan,Holy Bond in Space Batman!,6,19 April 2006,"The James Bond series has always swung like a pendulum along a line of stupidity, flitting from more or less realistic spy thrillers like 'From Russia With Love' to the sheer ridiculousness of 'Die Another Day' with it's invisible cars and never-sleeping villains. 'Moonraker' is one of those entries which is very far removed from your standard spy film and from it's opening sequence of a space shuttle theft blowing up a 747 to the gloriously over the top laser gun climax, it wears its colours proud; this is James Bond as an action franchise with tongue lodged firmly in cheek.Whether you enjoy it the first time you catch it on one of the multitudes of Bond seasons that frequent television schedules these days then will depend on your mindset at the time. If for example you believe that Bond begins and ends with that Scottish man that everybody does impressions of then this isn't going to be the movie to change your mind. In Roger Moore's defence though, he is more than competent in the role and should be celebrated for playing the character his way, rather than trying to copy his predecessors. His version of James is like a public schoolboy on a round the world trip who also happens to be a deadly assassin; all double-entendres and raised eyebrows allied to a ruthless killing efficiency. Interesting to note that he only fires one gun in the entire movie, but just look at how he does it - effortlessly dispatching a would-be hit-man before nodding an arrogant gesture of triumph at Super Villain Of The Week Drax.However, if you're ready for a bit of mindless escapism with plenty of bad one liners (""I think he's attempting re-entry sir""), large explosions and beautiful women then this is certainly a lot more entertaining than some of the horrific misfires that would dog Brosnan's post-Goldeneye jaunts. Barely ten minutes elapses between set pieces before our man in the tuxedo finds a new way to get into peril and some of them are excellent. His bull-in-a-china-shop brawl with a Japanese martial artist in the middle of an art gallery for example is a riot, the two combatants smashing priceless artifacts to pieces with such reckless abandon there's barely time to question why Drax's henchman has brought a wooden sword to the fight. And then there's Jaws. Oh yes, Jaws. Richard Kiel returns for his second and final time as the metal-toothed and indestructible giant and though he manages to speak only four words in the entire movie, he is still one of the most memorable aspects, his facial expressions summing it all up. Just look at those bulging eyes and the slack jawed terror when his speed boat first pitches over the side of a colossal waterfall, or his frantic attempts to fly when a parachute fails to open. Kiel is nothing less than a scene stealer all the way through and while some may moan about him becoming more of a slapstick foil this time around, just check out the moment where he advances in a carnival costume down on a dark alley on one of his foe's numerous lady friends; cold and evil menace made reality.In short then one of the most riotously-enjoyable entries in the franchise. It's not a classic by any means and the fun factor hinders that status as much as it helps it, but it's still a worthy entry. It may have a higher level of a camp than an episode of the old Adam West Batman TV series, but as one of the suave super-spy's less cerebral adventures it definitely delivers the goods.",Moonraker
128,EvanKevelson,It's All downhill from the age of 52-58.,3,27 February 2021,"Personally when I rate a Bond Film a rate it only in the context of all Bond Films pre-Daniel Craig (being he is a reboot not a continuity Bond). These aren't deep message films they are action films based on a covert MI-6 agent whose missions are to infiltrate, gather Intel and kill when necessary. The Rating also has to be looked at From a historical perspective not only factually but sociological norms of that particular era.
So if I see a review that depicts racism(lack of black characters) or depiction of Connery or Moore as a sick misogynistic animal... I know the reviewer is ignorant of what audiences where pleased by between 1962-1977 etc... They also are just as fanatic in liberal ideology as a religious conservative fanatics. These were till 1973 ""Guy Films"" not date films.
Criticizing Bond on a ""morality"" basis is the same as criticizing looney tunes for excessive violence. It's moronic.
The rest of the Moore Bonds starting with this has narrowed its target audience for the Bond Geek, to9-12... HS is out for the remaining three worst Bond films and most embarrassing productions from 1964-2002.
Our diabolical nemesis is Hitler in space... need I say more about the story, outside of the Aryan Space race this is pretty much the same film as the ""Spy Who Loved Me"". At this point Moore looks like he could use a face lift and a personal trainer. The man is simply too old and too silly. And the effects were good but not close to Starwars.",Moonraker
129,dasa108,Roger Moore's Best Bond Movie (So Far),7,6 September 2021,"This film has several peculiarities: its rhythm is more dynamic, there is more humor, repetitive jokes in relation to the previous film (finding Bond in a bed is almost the easiest thing in the world for international authorities), the appearance of Richard Kiel again as a villain, the villain who wants to dominate the world is elegant but silly and the settings chosen for the film are magnificent. The action sequences are pleasant and despite the fact that Moore notoriously does hardly a single stunt scene, that fact does not compromise the final result. It's a big upgrade from the weak previous installment. Obviously it has its weak points but the interesting thing is that love triumphs at the same time as our amazement.",Moonraker

131,ReelCheese,Does It Ever End??,3,10 September 2006,"What should have been a fun little Bond venture turns into a drawn-out, largely unexciting spectacle in MOONRAKER. Roger Moore, already a little aged to play our hero, is dispatched to find out the five W's of a hijacked space shuttle called the Moonraker. From California to Venice to Outer Space, he discovers that the wealthy, eccentric Hugo Drax is behind it all - all part of a plan to wipe out the entire human race!MOONRAKER has the feel not of a big-budget Hollywood production, but of a 007 ripoff. Everybody, particularly those behind the scenes, just seem to be going through the motions without much thought. They try to rely too heavily on the likability of the character, distracting romance and terribly unfunny shots at humor. Even the sporadic elements of MOONRAKER that do work, such as the high-flying opening and the cable car showdown, seem clumsy. The final 20 minutes, with its incredibly cheesy astronaut battle and explosions, take far too long to arrive.Sometimes labeled the worst of the Bond series, MOONRAKER disappoints whether you're a fan or not. An apparent attempt to merge the world's greatest spy with the outer space craze of the late 1970s, this one falls flat on its face.",Moonraker

A little overlong, even though most of them run about 10-20 minutes too long in general. ""Moonraker"" begins as the remains of the moonraker ship are lost and Bond must investigate. This is the simplest idea of the bond films, yet I was lost as to how far-fetched this film became. Jumping from ski lifts and going to space has never felt like the grounded film a bond picture should be. Overall, I did not care for this film very much. For it's characters or it's story. Some of the action is fun, but that's about it. One of my least favorite.",Moonraker
133,jonathanruano,Moonraker -- A Review,4,6 October 2009,"Director Lewis Gilbert's Bond film ""Moonraker"" was very popular when it first came out; but in retrospect, Gilbert did so much better with his previous Bond film, ""The Spy who loved me."" Admittedly, Moonraker is not a complete disaster. It started out quite well with a fight in mid-air between James Bond (Roger Moore) and Jaws (Richard Kiel). Richard Kiel also provided most, if not all, of the excitement and laughs in the rest of the film. There is also something very appealing about watching James Bond visit exotic places, like Venice, Italy and Brazil.But when Jaws becomes more likable than James Bond, then you know something is very wrong. Far from being charismatic and dynamic (the qualities we admired in Sean Connery), Roger Moore's James Bond has a big problem expressing any kind of real emotion and therefore lacks the appeal to carry this film forward. The Bond girls (like Lois Chiles) are pretty, but are not very interesting. Apparently, back then it was considered sexist for women to have sex appeal and Moonraker was meant to reflect that. But why not have a Bond girl who could show Diana Rigg's initiative in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" or the sassy quality of Jill St. John in ""Diamonds are Forever""? In other words, why not have women who can be so much more than just porcelain dolls? Finally, the villain Drax is the dullest of all, which is unfortunate because usually the creators of the James Bonds are very good a creating villains.",Moonraker
134,general-melchett,Why did this do so bad?,9,9 December 2006,"I am very surprised that people call Moonraker the worst Bond - I think it is great. It may be 27 years old now, but Bond's first scene on the plane with Jaws is one that I won't forget and always enjoy watching. It isn't badly done either - I don't understand why Moonraker has lost universal appeal.This Bond is also full of classic scenes - including the bit where Bond drives the special Gondola through the streets of Italy and the bit where Bond shoots the sniper who is trying to kill him from a tree. The fact that this Bond was filmed in space makes it a true landmark in film-making - even nowadays, filmmakers rarely go beyond the bounds of Earth.Roger Moore is a good Bond, and one of the most well-known. Richard Kiel is brilliantly menacing as Jaws, who keeps his status as a great baddie throughout the whole film. Bond's best line in this film was ""Take a giant leap for mankind"", after killing Hugo Drax on his space station and then pushing him into space to his death. With classic quotes, action scenes and Bond's super-spying, why did Moonraker lose appeal with many? I don't care what you lot think - I think Moonraker is a great Bond and one that should be watched many times to appreciate its true glory. Even if it is just to see the ninja get thrown out the clock tower and go crashing into the concert hundreds of feet below, I still recommend you give this one a try. Brilliant! 9/10",Moonraker

We saw BattleStar Galactica. And they were all big hits in the box office, or in the case of BSG, cult favorites. In comes Moonraker, Taking the success of Star Wars and using it in the Bondfranchise. The plot here is simple. There is one very rich bad guy. And Bond must take him down, no questions asked.We don't really know the villain's plot until the very end. We don't know why there is a space station up there until the very end. This film was loaded with extras, great costumes, set design and very good stunts. Most of the film is a collaboration of scenes involving Bond and his quirky humorous way of fighting. The acting wasn't very serious, it felt very comic bookish, but its OK, because the movie doesn't try to be serious really.In the end, we are given the motives for the villain's actions. He doesn't say much, but he doesn't have to. The audience is given enough information, just sit back, enjoy the space battles in this, because they are superb. The CGI was fantastic, the models of the Space Shuttles were incredible, as well as the eerie Space Station that makes you think of our ISS and how prophetic this film really is!

Perhaps little children might find the gondola chase scene entertaining but that only shows how bad this series has become since the glory days of ""From Russia With Love"" and ""Goldfinger."" Bond is now pretty much a space cowboy who knows how to fly a space shuttle, steer a motorized gondola, ride a horse, free fall from an airplane, maneuver a runaway gurney, and put the shuttle on autopilot so he can have sex with bland Dr. Goodhead.

Agent 007 James Bond blast into orbit in this action packed adventure that takes him to Venice, Rio de Janeiro and Outer Space.Summary: When Bond investigates the hijacking of Moonraker, which was piggyback on an American Space Shuttle, he and the beautiful CIA Agent Dr. Holly Goodhead are soon locked in a life or death struggle. The person there struggling with is Hugo Drax, a power mad industrial whose horrified scheme may cause people to reshape there lives. The picture opens with the shuttle riding piggyback when the engine fires and it takes of on its own. James is shown to be in a private plane when he's left by himself as the man and lady that were with him, shootout the plane instruments before bailing out. Therefore, Bond jumps out of the plane after and goes after the man that has the parachute. Both Bond and the man he's after fight over the parachute as they fall through the sky heading for land. James is summoned by the British Prime Minister to find out what happen to Moonraker. Therefore, Bond leaves the office and goes to California where he's met by a helicopter who takes Bond to Hugo Drax place of training. After a meeting with Drax, Bond is given a tour of the grounds. After his tour, Bond is taken and introduce to Dr. Holly Goodhead and she process to take Bond to see Moonraker. Drax tells his supervisor to make sure some harm comes to Bond. Bond is put into a machine by Dr. Goodhead that can reach 20G, which could kill you. When Dr Goodhead is call up by Mr. Drax, Drax hit-man takes over the experiment. As the supervisor takes control of the instruments he starts to make the machine go faster and faster. The only way for Bond to get the machine to slow down is to shootout the instruments. Later that night Bond charms his way into the Drax office where he unlocks the safe and takes pictures of plans that he found in Drax presents. The next day, Drax invites Bond to go on a pheasant hunt where Bond first shot takes down a pheasant. However, the price for one of the employees who help Bond could be costly. The role of Drax was first offered to James Mason who turned it down. In the picture The Spy Who Loved Me, Lois Chiles was offered the part to play Russian Agent Anya but turned it down because she wanted to cut back on her workload. Some parts of the picture where shot in different locations such as the Rockwell International Manufacturing Assembly Plant in Palmdale California. The other location that was used for this picture was the Vehicle Assembly Building in Cape Canaveral in Florida. This was the fourth film in which roger Moore was used as James Bond and the second one that the opening scene was shot with Bond using a parachute. This was the first movie that featured a space shuttle. The release of this film was suppose to be around the time the NASA was going to release its first ever shuttle launch into outer space. In order to create the final shot in which the space station is destroyed, the visual effects crew locked themselves in the studio and shot the model of the space station to pieces using shotguns. When work on the film began, NASA had in fact not yet officially finalized the design of the Space Shuttle. Fortunately, for the production designers, there were subsequently no visible changes made to the shuttle's design, making their rendering of it accurate.As far as my thoughts on this movie? I didn't think that this picture had attention grabber that the others did. Even though I thought Lois Chilies was good she didn't have the glamor that some of the other Bond picture did. Barbara Bach would have done so much to the role of Bonds leading woman if she would have been given a chance.

I've always been a bigger fan of Connery over Moore, but having watched the show just this afternoon on cable reminds me of my affections for this outing.Moore follows a shuttle which was believe destroyed on this mission that sends him, once again, to the United States, where his CIA counterpart, for once, is not Felix Lighter (sorry if I misspelled the last name--& I am not going to spoil it for you, either).  Among his travels, he encounters many space related problems and his old nemesis, Jaws.

'Moonraker' is usually sniffed at by Bond buffs, who regard it as the nadir of the Moore films, but I love it. As a strapping lad growing up in the '70's, I always made a point of seeing the latest Bond, and having fish and chips with my mates afterwards. We didn't care if the films were faithful to Fleming, if there was too much humour, or if Roger Moore's acting was wooden, we went to have a jolly good time and did. We'd seen Connery's Bonds on telly but for us, Roger Moore was The Man. Suave, sophisticated and debonair. On leaving the theatre we'd attempt to recreate Bond's fights, usually resulting in one of us getting cautioned by the police. And the gadgets! 'Moonraker' outdid them all. I once tried to build Bond's wrist-dart gun. I don't think anybody walked out of a Timothy Dalton Bond feeling like they could conquer the world, but with Roger's we did. And we saw them more than once in cinemas. No matter how many actors play the role, he's the one I remember with most affection.",Moonraker
141,MF210,Its one of the most obviously flawed Bond films but it is enjoyable and thats what counts for Bond,8,26 January 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****. I have been reviewing James Bond films from the Volume 2 pack I got for Christmas. I have seen You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever, and now Moonraker. So far out of those three the one that I like the best is You Only Live Twice. In fact, I hated Moonraker when I first saw it.
I can honestly say now I have a favorable reaction towards Moonraker. Its not quite as good YOTL but it is certainly better than Diamonds are Forever. Like Diamonds, Moonraker is hailed as one of the worst Bond films. To be frank, it is easy to have that kind of reaction. The plot is absolutely preposterous: Bond in Space? That was my reaction the first time. It is quite obvious Moonraker has flaws, I mean nearly every Bond film has flaws.
One disappointment about Moonraker is how terribly bland the Bond Girl turns out to be. Despite being attractive, Lois Chiles is dull as Holly Goodhead. She is definitely better than say Jill St. John as Tiffany Case but pales to the likes of Ursula Andress and Honor Blackman. This was one of the problems I had with Moonraker the first time I saw it and its still a problem here.
Michael Lonsdale is solid as Drax but he still cannot stand up with the greater villains. In many ways Richard Kiel is much more memorable as Jaws. He has an undeniable screen presence and is not someone you would want to run into in an alley (this happens in the film). Although he undoubtedly pales to Connery and even Brosnan, Roger Moore is quite good as Bond here. He has a certain charm that makes him memorable but at the same time his film gets a little silly. This is the first film I have seen with Moore as Bond. The special effects in Moonraker are quite impressive. They are at least close to being as good as Star Wars special effects. The action scenes are all done well. My favorite being the Cable Car scene. Moonraker will more likely be looked at as a weaker Bond. It is by no means a great film or a great Bond. But it is definitely a good Bond that (for the most part) will keep you entertained from start to finish.",Moonraker
142,carologletree,A Underrated Bond Movie that is a Lot of Fun,7,8 January 2016,"This is often ranked pretty low on people's lists of worst Bond movies. However, I disagree. I think this movie is a lot of fun, and it's head and shoulders above ""Diamonds are Forever"" and ""The Man With The Golden Gun.""Roger Moore is in his prime and is once again great as James Bond, and the silly nature of this movie really is fitting for his humorous personality. Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead is the typical Bond girl: gorgeous but with very little personality.I thought that Hugo Drax, played by Michael Lonsdale, was an excellent Bond villain. He was quite sinister and had a pretty crazy plan to wipe out the World's population and recreate humanity with a master race.We also get the return of Jaws, who is once again a very threatening figure. Go ahead and shoot me for this, but I actually liked that Jaws found himself a girlfriend. I felt that it brought some humanity to the character.This is definitely one of the most action-packed James Bond movies to date. From the boat chases to the sword fight in a glass museum to the sequences with Jaws to the crazy laser battles out in space, this is an action extravaganza.John Barry returns as the music composer, and he gives us some of his best work in this film. The music score here has a great sense of wonder and just really fits all the scenes it is in. The theme song, Shirley Bassey's final James Bond song, also has a wondrous feeling and atmosphere about it.People might be right when they say that this is basically ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" in space, but this movie does what you want in a Bond film: it provides escapist entertainment. For that I like it.RATING: B",Moonraker
143,Ibuk,Moonker-Last of the good Moore outings,7,15 May 2008,"Actually this was on of the Bond movies I detested as a child(I even posted a comment expressing my hatred for it). My gripe about Moonraker was what they did to Jaws. I saw it on the DVD shelf in my local videostore and decided I should give it another go. I am truly glad I did because after watching it again I realised what a magnificent Bond movie it is. Moonraker was the last of the great Moore Bond's, FYEO, Octopussy and AVTAK were bland by the numbers outings. The theme tune sung by Shirley Bassey is actually pretty good. The opening sequence which involves a mid air struggle for a parachute was absolutely breathtaking. Moonraker has some truly great scenes, the cable car sequence for instance. I used to loathe Moonaker, now every time I see I love it more and more.",Moonraker
144,LuboLarsson,007 in Space,8,7 July 2002,"Roger Moore returns as James Bond 007 in his fourth Bond movie. After the fantastic The Spy who Loved Me the Bond filmakers really had to pull out all the stops to top it. To do this they had a huge budget (for 1979) $30, plus they tried to cash in on the Sci-Fi boom created by Star Wars. The result was in many peoples minds one of the worst Bond films, because mainly I suppose because it is so over the top. It is also very similar to in storyline to the previous film (swap underwater for Space), have the same henchman (Jaws) etc. It does seem a bit James Bond by numbers. Then why is it that I love this entry so much?. Well as I mentioned before Jaws returned, my favourite Bond henchman, also John Barry scored the film and its a fantastic score too, especially when they finally enter space. The sets and special effects are wonderful, give me this over the computer trickery of Attack of the Clones anyday! Holly Goodhead (snigger) is a great Bond girl, she's a match for him and Lois Chiles is beautiful AND she can act, actually look out for her in a cameo role in the first Austin Powers film! Also Michael Lonsdale as Drax is the bet Bond Villain since Donald Pleasence in You only live twice. The only downers are the over reliance on comedy, I hate the sequence in Venice when Moore drives his Gondala through the square with a pigeon doing a double take, awful! Plus the theme song is a bit weak too. They made the next Bond film more reaistic so just sit back and enjoy this one, its terrific entertainment. ***8/10***",Moonraker
145,C22Man,Double taking pigeon,4,13 July 2015,"Bond Review. Title: Another title that sounds cool, but doesn't really mean anything.Pre-Titles: A space shuttle on loan to the British government is mysteriously stolen in mid-air. Meanwhile Bond is forced to jump from his hijacked plane and battle old foe Jaws for a parachute. The first part is dull yet it sets up the story. The plane jump features truly outstanding stunt work and is shot incredibly well as Bond plummets to Earth. It's as exciting an opening as you could want.Theme Song: Shirley Bassey returns for her third theme and it isn't as memorable as her other two. It isn't a bad song, it's just a bit slow and it doesn't have that good a hook or lyrics. Given the films tone and plot something with more energy would have fit better.Plot: Bond is sent to find out who took the space shuttle, which leads him to Drax Industries and he begins to investigate the creator Hugo Drax. He soon discovers that Drax plans to create his own perfect human race on board his space station and Bond must stop him killing everyone on Earth. As you can see the story is incredibly far-fetched even for a Bond film. The plot is also extremely similar to The Spy Who Loved Me, but instead of an underwater civilisation it's one in space. The motivation for Drax to do something so crazy isn't given a good enough explanation and Bond gets lost beneath all the silly events taking place.James Bond: Roger Moore is as charming and likable as ever in the role, but he isn't given anything interesting to do. He still looks fantastic and delivers the one-liners with ease as usual. Yet he does appear a bit too casual at times considering the bizarre mission he's on and doesn't get to stretch the role.Bond Girls: Lois Chiles is decent as CIA operative/NASA scientist Holly Goodhead. She is very charming and has a warm screen presence. However she isn't very believable as a scientist or an agent and in the grand scheme of things she just isn't that memorable. Corinne Clery is okay as Drax's captive pilot, but she isn't given much screen time to leave her mark.Villains: Michael Lonsdale is surprisingly good as Drax. He has some truly brilliant lines and his mildly bored delivery makes them all the funnier. He has the some bored expression throughout and it actually adds to the character as he is clearly sick of Bond's intrusions. Richard Kiel returns as Jaws and the character is watered down which is a shame. His role is played for laughs much more and though some parts are amusing he doesn't feel like a genuine threat, not to mention his sudden turn to Bond's side feels forced.Support: Bernard Lee gives his final performance as M. His stern portrayal was always dependable as well as enjoyable and he would certainly be missed. Geoffrey Keen makes a welcome return as minister of defence Frederick Gray.Action: The action ranges from stupidly overblown to surprisingly fantastic. Bond fights Drax's henchman Chang in a museum and it is a really entertaining scene. Bond also fights Jaws atop a cable car and it is fantastic, both tense and well shot. However we get Bond fleeing some henchmen via gondola in Venice and as if that was dumb enough it then drives on land. The climax is very messy with a massive laser filled battle between the two sides and it's difficult to care about it.Score: John Barry makes a welcome return and provides another solid score. The music here is slightly slower and more romantic in many places which is a nice change, but when it needs to be high-octane Barry delivers the goods.Production Values: Lewis Gilbert does a competent directing job here, but many of the shots feel too much like a call back to his previous two Bond films at times. By far the biggest issue is the tone and story set-up however. The story is just so absurd that it's difficult to get yourself invested in what is taking place. The direction and editing doesn't make it any easier to follow or any more enjoyable. The humour is just too silly here and it is played up far too much. The best evidence is in the gondola scene with a man looking in shock at his wine and a double taking pigeon, it's so forced that it's painful. On the other hand the locations all look fantastic and we get a great amount of variation, moving from Venice to Rio de Janeiro to the Amazon. The stunt work is consistently excellent here and most of the effects do look very impressive for the time.Conclusion: Moonraker is possibly the most hit and miss of all the Bond films. For all the good things it does, it has just as many bad moments. We get a solid Moore performance, an amusing villain, very good effects and some great visuals. But we also get a forgettable Bond girl, a ludicrous plot and some painful humour. The action sequences pretty much sum the film up, with some being spectacular and others being ridiculous. It was clearly a response to the Sci-Fi craze of the day and you have to treat much of it as daft entertainment to truly enjoy, but if you can do that you'll have a fun time.",Moonraker
146,adrongardner,Spacey but far from the worst,7,21 November 2012,"Of all the James Bond movies, Moonraker seems to elicit the quickest negative opinions in conversation. The producers, admittedly, attempted to capitalize on the sci-fi bandwagon of the late 70s taking major liberties with the original story and rocketing James bond to space. On the cover of it all, indeed even the movie poster itself, this is a laughable scenario. But in practice, I'm not sure it's actually enough to doom this Bond outing. In my opinion, Moonraker is far from the worst Bond movie, and actually quite enjoyable.All Bond movies are a product of their time. All these movies are a great reflection and pulse of their respective contemporary popular culture. So while today it is easy to say Moonraker is a cheesy forgettable Bond movie, I'd say you never saw Live and Let Die or Octopussy. Essentially, you've already seen Moonraker. Just like The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker is yet another re- working of You Only LIve Twice which was really just reworked from Thunderball. A water/space craft is stolen and taken to an underwater/outer space fortress to wreak havoc on the free world. That's pretty much it.So you think Moonraker is cheesy? Space Shuttle cheesy? Did nobody actually watch Goldfinger and the laser beams, razor Odd Job hat, or Thunderball jet pack? Jaws is a good guy cheesy? Well Lois Chiles' ""Goodhead"" is pretty laughable, but runner up to the raciest double entendre after Pussy Galore. There are no stupid poison tipped knife shoes. Bond does not build a helicopter from a briefcase or dress up as a clown. Moonraker is definitely riding the coattails of the near perfect success of The Spy Who Loved Me, one of the top two Bond movies ever in my book, and it's a great piece of entertainment with a nice, if nonsensical, title song. There is no perfect or reference Bond film. They are all just escapist entertainment with flaws keenly visible on any repeated viewings. Many people want to point to Goldfinger as the, er, gold standard, but it's cheesy as heck in every way. While Connery is easily the best 007, I think On Her Majesty's Secret Service, The Spy Who Loved Me and Goldeneye are the actual movie benchmarks. But don't fool yourself thinking Bond is anything more than a two hour fantasy. Even the really bad ones like Die Another Day, License to Kill or Live and LEt Die are watchable. Moonraker fits nicely in the middle. Don't be a snob, Moonraker isn't a comment on the human condition but it's fun and entertaining in a way the dour and stale Skyfall isn't. Cut it some slack. Space Camp from 1986 is much worse than this.",Moonraker
147,martinpersson97,Another fun adventure with some great special effects,8,28 March 2020,"James Bond continues his adventures admist the cold war-setting, this time taking on an important part of that rivalry: the space programs.Who will venture into space first was a big part of the Soviet-American cold war conflict, which would inevitably be explored in the 007-franchise and it does so in a great fashion. The space scenes in this movie look spectacular, and there are lots of suspensful quiet scenes outside the space craft.The villain, as usual, are fun and sort of over-the top and there is even a bit of a layer given to one of the most unlikely of villains: Jaws, who in the end shows he has a heart.Overall, it's not one of the best in the series, but, as usual, it is a fun adventure worth visiting, of only for Moore's charms or the incredibly visuals.",Moonraker

149,fletch5,"Shallow, but not that bad compared to some other Bond films.",7,20 February 2001,"Compared to ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" or ""A View to a Kill"", surely ""Moonraker"" can't be THAT bad. Admittedly, it has several silly moments and outrageously over-the-top scenes (culminating into the infamous laser battle), but it can offer 2 hours of good, harmless entertainment if you watch it with an open mind.""Moonraker"" sticks to the Bond formula very strictly. The film is merely a string of technically impressive action sequences in different exotic locations. Something reminiscent of a plot is there in order to give it a little coherence.James Bond does seem out of place as a space hero, but the idea of him in a ninja school (""You Only Live Twice"") was just as ridiculous. Drax is a dauntingly typical megalomaniac, but Lois Chiles' Holly Goodhead is one of the smarter Bond girls. However, she's not as alluring as Corinne Clery in a minor role.Shirley Bassey's barely memorable title song is one of the weakest in the series.",Moonraker
150,Zoooma,007 Goes Sci-fi,7,28 January 2014,"I'm not sure what to make of this one. It's one of my least seen pre-90's Bond movies; I've maybe seen it just once before, probably twice and not in a long time. Good that John Barry is back for music. The last film had Marvin Hamlisch and he disco-infused the Bond Theme all the way through, then during the end credits it sounded like a Broadway musical number. Ugh! Back to sanity here. Unfortunately the plot took forever to get to while James womanized and hopscotched across the globe. This being the 4th Roger Moore film as Bond, and it being 8 years since Sean Connery, it's getting easier to accept Mr. Moore in the 007 role. He's really coming into his own by now. Overall, I liked it. It's entertaining enough, particularly the boat chase, Moore's second as Bond. Hard to beat the scenery, too -- Venice and Rio. Outstanding!--A Kat Pirate Screener",Moonraker
151,rjsf96,Bond Reaches New Levels of Ridiculousness,3,29 October 2015,"Riding on the back of the success of Star Wars, production was postponed on For Your Eyes Only and Moonraker was launched straight into production. Although financially successful, the actual film itself is a colossal disaster.With a plot almost identical to that of The Spy Who Loved Me, although this time space is the objective to breed new human life, not the sea. Moonraker sees millionaire Hugo Drax hatch a plot to create a perfect human race in space, whilst creating global destruction below on Earth. It is up to Bond to stop him and the franchise from sinking into the dirt.If you are only here to witness the pre credits sequence you are in luck. This one sees Bond free fall out of a plane and tries to claim a parachute from another man, before he plummets to his death. In all fairness to Moonraker this sequence is truly thrilling. The rest of the film never manages to top this brief five minute sequence. So what went wrong? Some of the classic elements are still in place. An entertaining and mad villain in the form of Hugo Drax played by Michael Lonsdale who practically seems to bounce on the tip of his toes whenever he is shown on screen. Roger Moore looks at home this time and could Sean Connery really work in a film this mindless and absurd?The first signs of trouble appear during the second act. A high speed gondola chase takes place in Venice and Bond's gondola is particularly special. It can even go on land! With a speed equivalent of walking pace. You sigh. You groan. You look at your watch in despair. There's still seventy minutes left and they have not reached outer space yet. The Bond girl is stunning and yet again she poses no real significance to the plot. Still you manage a smirk when you hear her name for the first time; Dr Holly Goodhead.By the final act though the film runs on its own accord and is almost unwatchable. Jaws becomes an anti-hero who helps Bond, another spaceship shoots lasers at Drax's and Bond? Well he becomes the first man to have sex in a spaceship.If it sounds painful to watch that's because it is, with the small compensation that it is not as weary or worn down as The Man with the Golden Gun. Moonraker marks an all-time low in the Bond franchise. It's just lucky that this was not Bond's final mission and by some miracle he still continues to live on to this very day. Nadirs like Moonraker though are not helping.",Moonraker

Jaws on the other hand is almost Invincible!Quite a far fetched ending in space especially catching up with the bombs.Keep him out of space, he's much better.",Moonraker
153,stp43,Bond Blasts Off Against Memorable Foe,8,1 October 2003,"Moonraker is something of the guilty pleasure of the James Bond series. It is the one that polarizes Bond fans the most, criticisms aimed primarily at the film's admitted excess of comedic relief and at the inappropriate nature of the sci-fi aspect of the plot.While the comedic relief in the film is admittedly a bit much, it does not hurt the film fatally, and the space setting of the film is a natural evolution given the space themes of Dr. No, You Only Live Twice, and Diamonds Are Forever.  Some of the comedic relief actually winds up making the film better, primarily in the film's treatment of outsized killer Jaws; Richard Kiel becomes the first villainous henchman to return to the series from a previous Bond film.  In the film Jaws acquires a love interest (Blanche Ravalec; she is not overtly identified in the film but listed as Dolly in the credits), and while the introduction is cheesy (overblown music amid the wreckage of a destroyed Brazilian gondola), the denoument proves strikingly effective, when the full extent of his employer's plans sinks in to Jaws, and his heart is swayed by the love of Dolly; at the end Jaws and Dolly have a tender scene with a toast in which Jaws has his only lines of dialogue in the series; ""Well, here's to us.""  Certainly no one could have expected this pairing to work as superbly as it does.Character interplay also serves the film well.  James' interaction with Sir Miles Meservy (this proved to be Bernard Lee's final go as M) and Major Geoffrey Boothroyd is better than normal and includes the introduction of my favorite Q gadget, the wrist-mounted dart discharger.  It proves decisive in James' relationship with Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles, initially considered for the role of Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me).  Their relationship begins coldly, but begins to warm when Goodhead places James in a centrifuge chamber and it malfunctions and threatens to crush James to death; he uses Q's dart discharger to blast the controls out of action and slow the centrifuge to a stop.  Roger Moore wisely plays the scene totally straight, brilliantly pantomiming the sickening dizziness James feels upon exiting the centrifuge.James has been assigned to investigate the disappearence of a Moonraker shuttle on loan from the US Air Force to the RAF; HMSS has found evidence that the craft was hijacked in mid-air, and James must begin his investigation by interviewing the shuttle's builder, head of Drax Industries Hugo Drax (Michel Lonsdale, his name anglicanized as Michael for US audiences).  Here the film engages in a brilliant use of ""masking,"" using Paris Airport and a chateau and passing the setting off as California by explaining that the chateau was brought from France stone by stone in a forest straddling the Mojave Desert.Drax is the most understated Bond villian of all, easily matching Donald Pleasance's Blofeld in monotone of evil.  ""Look after Mr. Bond, see that some harm comes to him"" is one of the all-time best Bond lines.  Drax's sinister nature shows when he places a sniper for Bond amid a quail shoot, a shoot that Bond in his inimitable style foils; humiliated Drax watches Bond leave and then turns on his personal pilot Corinne Dufour (Corinne Clery), who suddenly must run for her life at the opursuit of hungry dogs, one of the most genuinely terrifying scenes of the series.James' investigation takes him to Venice, and a showdown with Drax that humiliates M and Defense Minister Frederick Grey (Geoffrey Keen), who demands Bond be suspended; James, however, has a crucial clue that leads him to Brazil, and eventually to alliance with Holly Goodhead as Hugo Drax's plan begins to unfold.The film displays some of the more engaging SFX of the opulently imaginative late-1970s-early 1980s sci-fi era as well as one of John Barry's strongest scores; particularly effective is the cue used for James' discovery of white-clad young women in the jungle of the Amazon.But the clinching scene comes at the end with by far the best double entendre of the series, coming as Q doesn't bother to watch a video display but instead reads a tracking scanner.Sci-fi may not be pure James Bond, but here it works for one of the most entertaining entries of the long and classic series.",Moonraker
154,cezbanbelubo,My godness,4,4 June 2020,My godness. Bond is in star wars. Very horrible. Jaws is nice,Moonraker
155,glenn-aylett,"Bloated, OTT, but well made for its time",6,26 July 2013,"After Diamonds Are Forever and A Licence To Kill, Moonraker is my least favourite Moore Bond. To me it's like an advert for Venice and Rio at times, the battle in the spaceship is a blatant cash in of Star Wars and has dated horribly, and Jaws turns into some banal comedy villain and his role develops into a far fetched love story with an American 18 year old. Also Moore is starting to age in Moonraker and looks less convincing in the fight scenes.This isn't to say Moonraker is dire in the way Diamonds are Forever is. It does have some very good parts. The scene with Bond nearly being crushed by G forces in Drax's gyroscope is brilliant, Drax is a convincing villain who wants to take over the space programme and start a world war, the gondola chase in Venice is entertaining, and Shirley Bassey provided a top notch theme song. It's just the whole film seems to be bloated, and the space station scenes seem too far fetched. However, Moonraker is still entertaining and the box office was excellent.",Moonraker

Shuttles started flying, cheap space flights seemed close. Bond director decided to go on a somewhat realistic approach... Well it would take a few hundred of space shuttle launches to build the space station portrayed in Moonraker and unfortunatly even today nobody built a private space station yet or did they?

I'm now 35, I was born in 77 so do the math. Well regardless I think this is now one of my favourite films, not just a Bond film, but a space film. I love everything about this film, it has class, great acting, great special effects(for it's time), and also a great score. I loved all the space scenes, they were reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey.I know Star Wars is the only reason Bond went to space in 1979, but still, it has great atmosphere, with an awesome technological story. They saved the best for last in this film, and I loved every minute of it.An arch villain trying to take over the world through some kind of atmospheric plague, creating a new super race. Sounds a lot like the idiot Hitler in WWII. Except this is on a more modern scale.I love this film for what it is, and love it as part of Bond history. Moore is excellent.

I've reached Moonraker, which I probably think is one of the absolute worst movies so far. It was moved forward in the canon after Star Wars was a colossal success, and therefore EON films certainly thought they could put themselves in the slipstream of the new interest in science fiction. Unfortunately, there are so many flaws and shortcomings in this film that it is far from successful. These films have never been good at conveying technology, so when a film relies so heavily on technology, one can almost guess the result.The film simply gets too outlandish, and I never understand Drax's motivation to create a new master race.The acting is below average - and the whole concept just seems too laid back. The film also has the absolute lowest rating in the entire film series, which is a shame since a lot of work has been put into it. Then there's the dumbest plot point I've seen this year - Jaws falls head over heels in love with a completely random girl that he wants to do absolutely everything for. Yes, it may seem like a small side plot, but it does have a huge impact on the outcome of the film's plot.All in all, it's a movie that's trying to stay in the slipstream of Star Wars' success, without having anything on its mind at all.",Moonraker

It is really a rip off of Star Wars which is a far superior movie to this. The movie has one good scene where Bond is attacked by an anaconda in a pool but that is about one of the only good scenes. Jaws is not bad in the movie. This is the first Roger Moore Bond Movie i have seen and i think Roger Moore was not too good in this movie.

It has a humorless Script, terrible Bad Guy(Hugo Drax not Jaws), terrible Theme Song, a beautiful but overall a flat Bond girl Holly Goodhead (She doesnt do much for the movie), and the dumbest plot ever.Alright this is Moore's 4th outing as Bond and it is pretty much a worthless piece of junk. Connery's 4th Bond was Thunderball which was really good. I only saw the Second Half of the Spy Who Loved Me (Moore's 3rd outing) but I could tell it was better than this.

161,eamon-hennedy,I LOVE IT!!!,10,24 March 2004,"Please, don't judge me too harshly, but I love Moonraker, the peak of all things Roger Moore. Never again would the Bond films be this over the top or overtly silly, but the truth is that Moonraker does it right. It will never win awards for being the most subtle Bond film ever made, but it should not be trashed in the way that it usually is because deep down Moonraker is just great fun. Roger Moore's Bond is just fun to be with, the on going joke that everytime Jaws tries to kill Bond he almost gets killed himself, complete with close ups of his exasperated face are brilliant (not subtle, but guaranteed to get you chuckling) and one of the loveliest Bond girls, CIA agent Holly Goodhead. The script here is definitely not in the same league as the likes of From Russia With Love, The World is Not Enough, Licence to Kill or For Your Eyes Only, but Bond films never set out to be thought provoking pieces of art, they are meant to be grandiose fun pieces of entertainment and if you take Bond films on those levels then Moonraker succeeds admirably. Sure none of the acting is award worthy, and its frequently over the top in every regard. Over the top humor, over the top action sequences (a fight scene in a glass shop sees every bit of glass get destroyed) while the space sequences features a gigantic space battle complete with laser beams.However there is a lot to like here. The pre title sequence is superb, featuring some of the best stunt work you will ever see in a pre-Brosnan Bond, the special effects are magnificent and lastly John Barry's music is quite simply the best he has ever come up with. For a film so over the top his music is beautiful and would set the hallmarks for his future scores. The sweeping orchestra and beautiful theme song by Shirley Bassey are classics.Once again I end my review with a note not to judge me, but Moonraker is simply wonderful entertainment and one of my favorite Bond film of all time.",Moonraker

The previous Bond film to this, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", is a definite UP. ""Moonraker"" is a definite DOWN.The plot is simply a rehash of the previous film. Mad man tries to kill everybody on the face of Planet Earth in order to start a new world order of which he is in charge of. It's got huge sets and action sequences in a deadly surroundings - this time the vacuum of space. It even has Jaws, a bad guy from the previous film, returning.This repetition of plot has been done before in the past - after all, it can be argued that ""TSWLM"" is in fact a re-hash of ""You Only Live Twice"". But it doesn't always work, and here is a fine example. It starts okay-ish, with a pretty fine aerial stunt marred by the appearance of Jaws - why is he there? Wouldn't Bond have spotted him on such a small plane? There are good points - no Bond film has no merits. Lois Chiles is rather good as the unfortunately named Holly Goodhead, packing quite a good punch in several of the scenes. She can certainly take care of herself. It is a pity that Bond's obvious sexism at the beginning spoils the mood a little.But again, like the previous film, where this film fails is it's baddie. Michael Lonsdale tries his best with Hugo Drax, but his portrayal just brings back memories of Stromberg from ""TSWLM"". As for Jaws, the less said about him the better.The music scores highly - John Barry is back on form, and the Shirley Bassey title song is a haunting ballad.But there's just something about this film that just doesn't work. Perhaps it is because that, up to now, there had been some elements of the Bond films that had been believable. ""Moonraker"" just goes straight off into the fantasy genre. I don't think that that is what Bond is about, and apparently so did Albert R ""Cubby"" Brocolli. ""For Your Eyes Only"" is true evidence of that...5/10",Moonraker
166,freewillyfan,Moonraker,6,1 November 2019,"Moonraker is the fourth Roger Moore Bond film and it might be the most over the top in the franchise. Roger Moore is good in the role and the villain and Bond girl I thought were decent. The henchman, Jaws, from the previous film was good until the end of the film. There are some fun action scenes but I found a lot of this film to be dull. The final act is very over the top when they go to space and there's a big space battle with laser guns. Even though that final act is goofy, you can have fun watching. Just the rest of the film was not too interesting But with a couple of fun action sequences throughout.5.8/10",Moonraker

He has settled nicely into the role but maybe is starting to look a bit old at 52 to be lusting after 20-year-olds.The pre-title sequence is again spectacular and involves a parachute (well it worked last time) However the theme music is not so memorable despite Shirley Bassey getting the job again and vocally as good as 15 years earlier.Richard Kiel gets the henchman role again as Jaws but plays it more for laughs. Michael Lonsdale is good as megabaddy Drax. M, Q, Moneypenny all present and correct, though this is Bernard Lee's last appearance as M, the actor dying before the next one could be completed.Eye candy is provided by Corinne Clery (as Corinne Dufour) and Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead. But acting is poor, Corinne is clearly dubbed, Chiles delivers every line in a monotone and I didn't find either of them as hot as Jaws' girlfriend played by Blanche Ravalec.How lovely it is to see Alfie Bass in a 5-second cameo.

168,TimBoHannon,"It Uses and Unconventional Approach, but it Is Fun and Impressive",7,15 February 2012,"A Bond movie's pre-title section often indicates how the rest of the movie will be. There are a few exceptions; ""Moonraker"" is not one of them. James Bond (Roger Moore) is on the ""last leg"" of a mission, introduced with the first of many genuinely funny puns in this movie. Naturally, the unnamed villains plan to eradicate Bond, leading to an action scene in free fall with one parachute too few. It is nonsensical, but genuinely entertaining, thanks partly to composer John Barry's music. This scene is not fitting in a James Bond movie, yet, like the rest of the movie, it is great fun to watch.Goofiness has decimated more than a fair share of Bond movies. ""Moonraker"" does not fall victim itself because the filmmakers did not try to mix silly with serious, and never made a mockery of their characters. That is the reason I was pleasantly surprised on my first viewing. I responded negatively after my second because I started to analyze it. I should not have been so serious. The enjoyment I felt the first time gave me all the information I need. Just because I did not understand why I enjoyed it the first time does not mean I have to hate it.""Moonraker"" is one of the two least popular Bond movies among the series' hardcore fans. It also made the most money until ""GoldenEye,"" and drew the most viewers and repeat viewers of all the Bond movies between Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. No matter how different the movie's tone is from the ""James Bond standard,"" it has enough positives to stand on its own. That is why both critics and audiences in 1979 voiced approval with their money and keyboards.Its production set at least three world records that are still unbroken: most break-away glass in one fight, largest sound stage ever used in France, and the greatest number of actors in simulated weighlessness. Ken Adam became a legendary production designer with his work on the James Bond movies. ""Moonarker"" is his final, and he saved his best for last. The fact that the two-time Oscar winner was not even nominated for his work in ""Moonraker"" is a sad example of how political the Academy is. Like the movie or not, the Venice, Amazon, and space station sets are more than likely to impress even the most skeptical Bond fan.After reporting to his boss's secretary (Lois Maxwell) that he fell out of a plane without a parachute, Bond is tasked with investigating the loss of an American space shuttle that disappeared en route to England. He first visits Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale), the shuttle's owner. When informed that the shuttle itself was not destroyed, Drax offers full co- operation, then orders Bond's elimination as soon as the latter leaves the room. I have either discussed or viewed this movie with a number of people. Even though this twist occurs less than 20 minutes in, the movie conceals Drax's villainy so well that none of these people suspected him.Drax's plot takes implausibility to its highest level. I will give no details except to say that it makes Karl Stromberg's grand scheme from the previous movie look sophisticated and sane. As advertised, the story boldly takes 007 where no British spy has gone before. Drax's space station remains the coolest set in the series. The simulated weightlessness remains impressive to watch more than 30 years later.In tune with the movie's comical nature, Drax is often unwilling to harm Bond unless he can amuse himself with the creativity of it. Drax has more off-beat lines than the next two or thee Bond villains combined. I am not sure there is anybody who would seriously say, ""you appear with the tedious inevitability of an unloved season"" or greet a stranger with, ""you have arrived at a propitious moment,"" but Drax has at least a dozen such lines. Lonsdale adds surreal humor to his role by speaking them with an almost bored somberness. A majority of actors work a whole career without having to say anything so weird. If Lonsdale realized that back in 1979, he certainly was not going to let anybody know.In the meantime, Jaws (Richard Kiel) from the previous movie is back. Jaws' outrageous physical power and invulnerability made him a liability in the previous movie. ""Moonraker"" stretches it and uses it as a reliable comic device. In one scene, he stops a gondola wheel with his bare hands. The wheel starts to move again, but one look from Jaws makes it think twice about being rebellious.The gadgets feature not one, but two special made boats. The first can convert to a hovercraft. Of course, Bond takes advantage of it, just in time for Victor Tourjansky to make another appearance as The Man with the Bottle in arguably the best running joke in the series. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) tops off his contribution by ending the movie with one of the cleverest double entendres in history.Does all of this lavish praise equal a recommendation? Perhaps it does. My girlfriend condemned ""For Your Eyes Only,"" Roger Moore's most serious Bond movie, as too cheesy. ""Moonraker"" joined ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""From Russia with Love"" as her favorites. That told a lot to me about how the casual Bond fan views ""Moonraker."" It does not deserve elite status because it does not deliver the excitement a Bond movie should, neither is it an example of great movie-making even with numerous strengths. That noted, it sells out completely to its premise and is not reluctant to take the extra effort to entertain. I disagree with the filmmakers' comedic approach, but they did aim to entertain. In that area, they succeeded. For that, I give ""Moonraker"" seven out of ten stars.",Moonraker

Far from it.Whilst in lockdown, I've decided to revisit the Bond movies again. Unfortunately, this is the worst thus far.I grew up with Roger Moore as James Bond, as a child in the 80s and 90s it was mostly the Moore era that was televised, but now I'm older, this is a far cry from Connery's Bond, and in Moonraker, he doesn't even feel like Bond, just Roger Moore.The movie is pretty bland. Many of the scenes are so boring and pointless, there's very little in way of story and Bond just happens upon things to progress the movie.Whilst James Bond has always been a man with vast general knowledge, this time it seems a stretch too far ""can I see the chemical compound?"" oh yeah, I know that. That's a rare flower which I happen to know about, which grows only in one place. Really!!??Jaws falling in love is pretty corny, but I kind of let it slide. What I don't get is at the end when they just sit there drinking champagne, doesn't even look like they want to return to Earth (but then somehow they do). When Jaws decides to help Bond, the conflict in him is very little, yet a few years later, Return of the Jedi did this to greater effect with Vader by building the tension.Also, Bond turning off his targeting computer... Sorry, selecting manual fire was a blatant rip off of Luke using the force to Destroy the Death Star.Finally, Drax is one of the worst villains. He had zero charisma and never seemed menacing once. Stromberg in the previous entry was far superior, Scaramanga and Goldfinger with deliciously twist and a joy to watch. Drax, on the other hand is as intimating as the worst versions of Blofeld - non threatening!",Moonraker

It's all about entertainment and I don't expect a Bond movie to be realistic.However, the 90 minutes before Bond arrives at the space station are bog standard and boring. The film makers didn't know how to get Bond to go to an evil space station so they just took a bunch of random scenes and tacked them onto the Bond formula. There are some good gags, but a lot of the scenes early on are forgettable.Jaws returns, and the scenes of him which were peppered in, as well as change of heart, were all entertaining. Lonsdale does a great job at playing a despotic but sophisticated villain. The third act features the most ambitious well thought out evil lair in the Bond franchise, a very strong climax and plenty of great special effects which have aged well to this day. There are moments worth watching for but I don't think this film comes together well as a whole.",Moonraker

This film works extremely well for several reasons: first, because Bond keeps his cool and escapes from so many deadly situations; second, because it is the most humorous of all Bond films, especially because of ""Jaws"" falling in love and its containing the best of Bond's one-liners; and third, because of the special effects the creators gave the film riding on the coat-tail of ""Star Wars"", released two years earlier.

174,Theflyace,Bond Month #11: A Fun Adventure with Outstanding Effects,7,17 October 2013,"When Star Wars came out in 1977, it was of course one of the best movies of all time and the most moneymaking film of all time up to that point. What could Bond do to keep up and cash in on this new space boom, Moonraker of course! People find this very silly, but its a fun Bond movie, but does it hold up? Hmm...The story again involves a megalomaniac trying to destroy the Earth to create a master race, only this time the filmmakers trade Under the Sea to the empty vacuum of space. Bond must stop Drax, who is a little more interesting and intimidating than Stromberg, who uses his Moonraker space shuttles as transports for his Aryan race to space. I've said space too much in the space provided for me to write about a movie with space in it. (If you can read that fast, you're good) Roger Moore is again in top form as Bond, finally settling his performance that he would use until he became 50 years old in A View to a Kill. Lois Chiles is a tad bit wooden and monotone as Dr. Holly Goodhead (hehe lawlz) Drax is very memorable because of actor Michael Lonsdale's commanding screen presence.The story is interesting because everything before the launch of Moonraker I find to be boring.When we get to space, however, its amazing to see all the special effects devised by Derek Meddings. Everything looks amazing and surprisingly great for model work, and when its combined with John Barry's excellent score for these scenes make them unbelievably awesome.Now with those things said, there are some silly things, like Jaws' girlfriend, yes that happens. The gondola on land in Venice, the nerve gas, the ninjas (never explained) and even the sky fight is moronic.But like I said before this film is very fun to watch. There are silly moments of course, but it doesn't make this the campy silly film that most people would think it is.

175,realalexrice,Moore's underrated Bond.,8,8 June 2021,"Movies, especially studio ones, are extremely reactionary so it's no surprise this was made to piggyback off the success of Star Wars, which was released 2 years prior. Unfortunately for the movie's very noted reputation as ""Bond goes to space,"" this has tainted it and many only remember it for the end where they do actually go to space plot, but in reality it, and the rest of the movie are not that bad. It's goofy and campy, but not particularly more than the others in Moore's cannon, or even the other Bond movies as a whole (Live and Let Die and Tomorrow Never Dies are far goofier than this just off the top of my head). Not to mention, the violence is pretty excellent and it feels as though Moore was getting as physically involved here, more than he had in previous outings. And it gets pretty dark with a death by hunting dogs being the initial (and essential, I guess) method of murder for the first Bond girl here. Overall, a great time though that I wasn't expecting that is much delightfully slower, and slightly less indulgent than the premise and studios reasons for making it let on. I'm probably rating a bit too high but I'm ready to turn the reputation around on Moonraker.Lastly, I cannot deny that the posters for this one are pretty cool (as they all were up until Licence to Kill) and I truly loved the space battle.",Moonraker
176,Jack_Yan,Moore comedy for Bond,8,2 October 1999,"Moonraker was the last time the Eon team made a slightly forward-looking Bond. While there are obvious references to the past, as is inevitable in every franchise, it makes a departure from previous outings by sending 007 into space. Today's Bond is a retro man, who tries to capture the romanticism of the past by driving what looks like Sean Connery's Aston Martin.One problem is that Moonraker is a remake of 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me with a space theme. Another is, as Bond fans will tell you, that this is hardly 'Ian Fleming's Moonraker' as the titles and movie posters proclaim. Only the recurring characters are the same (Bond, M, Q, Miss Moneypenny), but there is a different female lead role and the villain is no longer ex-Nazi Sir Hugo Drax, but Drax (no Christian name), obsessed now with the conquest of space rather than the destruction of London.Moviegoers must bear in mind that Moonraker is a comedy. This is about Roger Moore metaphorically winking at the camera. Moore himself has said he enjoyed his Lewis Gilbert-directed outings the most, because he and the director had a similar sense of humour, and both had a fun time injecting light comedy into the piece. Scriptwriter Christopher Wood has created something to suit, although the absence of Richard Maibaum is evident.Michael Lonsdale plays a suitably mad villain with such lines as 'First there was a dream, now there is reality,' and the famous 'Look after Mr Bond. See that some harm comes to him,' played with a menacingly calm manner (although not as nonchalantly as Gert Frobe in Goldfinger); but on the whole, all characters-and their wardrobes-are cartoon-strip caricatures.For moviegoers in 1979, one appeal was the return of Jaws (Richard Kiel), the most popular henchman of the franchise. In line with the comedic angle, Kiel has one sentence to say after two films, at the end of Moonraker. While scary in The Spy Who Loved Me, Jaws is now a cartoon villain, playing for laughs while Bond head-butts him in the teeth.There are some saving graces in the beauty of the Bond girls, but even they are flat characters who can hardly be called independent. Dr Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) may have a Ph.D. but can hardly be called a counterpart to Bond in the manner of the leading ladies in the Brosnan Bonds to date; but like Corinne Dufour (a luminous Corinne Cléry), she is stunning and the camera delights in her presence.Moonraker is notable for featuring the last appearance of the excellent Bernard Lee as M, here adopting a more fatherly relationship to Bond, as he occasionally does in the books.Maurice Binder's opening title is probably the best of all his Bonds; the primary colour tones are used to good effect, the typography observes certain rules about balance and letterspacing, and it has, for the most part, aged better than the rest of the film. John Barry's score is absolutely marvellous and heavily orchestral; there are strong melodies and it accurately reflects the comedic action in its arrangement of The James Bond Theme. The Moonraker theme itself is such a beautiful piece that it must rank as one of the finest Barry has composed; it is not as Bondian as Goldfinger or OHMSS, but it is very Barry, used most effectively as ""love themes"" when Bond meets Corinne in her bedroom-or when Bond meets Holly in hers. Shirley Bassey lends something to the vocals but in some respects she does not seem to be the right choice for such a romantic theme. Matt Munro might have been, but we will never know.There are some good (for 1979) special visual and miniature effects, particularly the floating-in-space sequences when the first astronaut arrives at Drax's space station, and Moonraker does not suffer as badly next to the space films of the era as, for example, You Only Live Twice (also directed by Gilbert) did against 2001: A Space Odyssey.Product placement is at its peak in this Bond film, in a far more obvious fashion than in Tomorrow Never Dies. Marlboro cigarettes and Air France tickets are in Holly Goodhead's drawer; Bollinger is referred to expressly by Bond; and a road in Brazil has the billboards of all the major participating companies in this film (!): Seiko, 7 Up, British Airways, Marlboro.The fun everyone had on the set is apparent. Provided that a goofy and offbeat Bond is what you seek, Moonraker doesn't fail to deliver: Jaws attempts to fly by flapping his arms when he discovers his parachute won't open; Alfie Bass coughs and chokes when he sees a villain's coffin floating down a Venetian canal; the opening notes of Close Encounters of the Third Kind are used as the code sequence to a secret lab; a tourist examines his wine label when he sees a gondola on land (an old joke, but thank you Christopher Wood); and Bond rides across the desert on horseback wearing a poncho to the theme of a wonderfully arranged The Magnificent Seven (a throwback to the John Barry Seven days-or simply a concession to the product placement by Marlboro?).This is not a Bond where you have to think. Then again, none of the Bonds are. As long as you approach it with comedy in mind, it is successful. Moore fans  those who enjoyed The Saint or The Persuaders  will find nothing wrong at all with this film and wonder why people are so cruel about it. This is the trademark light comedy Roger Moore Bond, and is a fine example of that genre  if it can be called one.",Moonraker

In this film, Bond tries to stop a madman from eliminating the human race on earth and breeding new life in outer space. Roger Moore does a superb job playing 007 with great wit and humor. Lois Chiles plays Dr. Holly Goodhead very well, and Michael Lonsdale is very convincing as the madman Hugo Drax. I found an editing goof the first time watching this. When Corinne (Corinne Clery) is seen running through the forest trying to escape Drax's hunting dogs, at first you see she's wearing beige shoes. Then in another angle, she's running with black high top boots for a second, then it's back to the beige shoes in the last angle.",Moonraker
178,rorymacveigh,My least favourite Bond film,1,29 August 2012,"I mean, just the idea of this is unbelievable, James Bond goes out into space and fires lasers to stop an evil man from making a Space Colony and gassing Earth. Those words alone should be the biggest turn off for any viewer, but apparently that's not the case.There are really too many Clichés in this film that you'll lose count within the first five minutes of which I have listed below:Instead of either shooting or stabbing Bond, they decide it's better to take what appears to be a very expensive plane and abandon it in mid- air, leaving Bond to tumble helplessly from the sky. Bond breaks free from his bonds (forgive the pun) and steals the nasty bad-guy's parachute and attempts to fight off Jaws (yes, him from the last one with the steel teeth), who is left crashing into a Circus Big Top.Rather than secretly killing him whilst Dr Goodhead is away, Drax instead sends his personal Ninja (wierd isn't it?), to turn up the G- force simulator to the point of death. Bond uses his special watch to blow up the controls and shut down the machine.Assassins to turn Bond into Swiss Cheese in the most obvious and overly engineered way possible. Bond escapes in what many have considered the stupidest escape method ever, using a Hovercraft disguised as a Venician Gondola! If you don't think that's stupid, I don't know what is!Rather than using a concealed assassin in the dark rooms, they instead have the Ninja from before try to slice him into Exotic food with a Sword. After running amok and smashing the Glass Museum into a broken mess, Bond is able to kick the Ninja out the front of a clock and down onto a restaurant below.Jaws (yes, he's still in this movie), cuts the steel cables with his razor sharp teeth before confronting Bond and Goodhead on the Cable Car as it tumbles to the bottom. Bond and Goodhead escape just in time for the car to smash straight into the bottom station. Again, Jaws, despite everyone else around him being dead from the impact, manages to calmly walk away, and in so doing comes across a girl and the pair fall in love.A group of henchmen in speedboats attempt to sink Bond in the Jungle. A concealed sniper would have worked perfectly, if not, pre-placed Depth Charges.Rather than having Bond and Goodhead put up against a wall and shot, he instead feels it necessary to put Bond under the blast pad of the launching Moonraker rocket and thereby cremate them. This of course leaves our heroes with ample time to escape and Drax's rocket blasts off into space, our heroes stowing aboard at the same time.In space, a Space Shuttle (which would normally take months to plan and prepare)full of Marines has been whistled up in a matter of hours to come to the aid of our heroes, resulting in a Laser Fight in Space!! This isn't the Battle of Yavin, this is James Bond!!Like many films of that era, it suffers from the Star Wars effect, where it feels the need to add lasers and space adventures so that it can keep with the current trend. But when you're dealing with James Bond, that cannot and will not work! Roger Moore's acting is quite enjoyable, with his endless run of One-Liner's coming over the hill like the American's at Iwo Jima and Michael Lonsdale makes a really good villain as the menacing and calculative Drax. But other than that, this film falls through the floor faster than Dr Schnider in The Last Crusade. Don't get me wrong, the idea of Social Cleansing with Nerve Gas can make a good story, but not when you apply it in Space with Lasers. It could have been a regional thing, possibly an act of Chemical Warfare on a neighbouring country, or an attempt at Ethnic Cleansing, but no, they had to drag it to the stars and leave it with it's head in the clouds. It's long winded, overly complex and just cannot be Bond...",Moonraker
179,skiop,Underrated Bond movie,7,29 June 2006,"""Moonraker"" is often said to be the worst Bond movie, but it's hard to understand why. It's fast-paced, entertaining and follows the ""Bond formula"" to the letter.The megalomaniacal villain is Hugo Drax, who's out to replace humans with his genetically engineered superhumans. The Bond girl who gets killed is Drax's pilot. The Bond girl who survives (Holly Goodhead, played by Lois Chiles) is a CIA agent. The exotic locations this time take place in South America; there are cities, swamps, pyramids and all sorts of other beautiful locations. And what Bond film doesn't include a memorable, totally implausible climax? This time it occurs in and outside of a space station.There are several good action scenes; for example, one in a G-force simulator and another on cable cars. The villain has truly insane ways to kill Bond, and all of them fail. There's a giant python that Bond kills in one scene, and in another, Drax puts Bond and Holly under the exhaust of a space shuttle, ignoring that there was a shaft that they could escape through.The special effects are excellent. I don't know how ""Alien"" could have won the Oscar over ""Moonraker."" This is especially true during the laser battle at the end. And James and Holly trying to destroy the errant gas pellets is very tense.Lois Chiles isn't much of an actress, but her character is a good one. She won't put up with Bond's sexist nonsense, and she can really kick some tail. Richard Kiel returns as ace henchman Jaws, but this time he isn't quite as mindless.This movie isn't ground-breaking in any way whatsoever, but it is an entertaining movie that those who like cinematic Bond should like.",Moonraker

181,clh-1,The Most Beautiful thing Ever put in a Bond Movie,8,10 November 2005,"When Jaws and his girlfriend end up together and Jaws ends his maniacal quest to bring about death and violence. He just needed to be emotionally fulfilled, it brings a tear to my eye every time I see it. Man...I'm so lonely.Actually this is one of the most divisive Bonds, it made a lot of money, over $200 million when the average price of a movie ticket was less than $3. But the reason for that has been hotly debated. Some think that since the late-1970's were the hey-day of sci-fi spectacles, people were just continuing the fad, which coupled with the mere fact that it was a Bond picture (none of which have ever lost money in theaters) kept people coming to the theaters. Others think it is a really good movie. I take a somewhat middle of the road stance.As far as action and sci-fi films go, this is the top of the line, better than anything to be brought forth by most of the action ""stars"" of the 80's and 90's (yet strangely nobody ever lists Roger Moore among the action heroes). As a Bond film, it's far from the worst. Not the best film in the series, and I have seen them all, but somewhere in the middle. Roger Moore is my favorite James Bond, reputed to be Ian Flemmings original choice for the role, he had to wait ten years to get his shot, oh well the time brought forth a great experienced Bond. As the oldest Bond (oldest at time of casting and at time of final appearance), Moore had a certain quality that I always liked even when I started watching Bond films at the tender age of five-which incidentally was A View to a Kill, another Moore film-I guess he is just ""my Bond"". The things that make a bond film work are here, the gadgets are in force. Q is around with some of the best witty banter. Miss MoneyPenny is in fine form-dang Lois Maxwell was hot. Drax, our main villain, seems to have put some real planning into his plot for world domination. He has armies of people who are ready to put it into motion, not just cannon fodder for when Bond starts to ruin the bad guy's plan. Very much of it's day, the film is a little dated when you consider the space shuttle is about to be retired in the real world, but there hasn't been a Bond film that doesn't get dated after a while, no biggie. Everything works, we were used to high tech cars and boat chases, the production staff threw us for a loop with a high tech boat chase. You know they're thinking when they combine the nest elements from the previous films without making it look stupid or insulting to our intelligence.And then there is the relationship between Jaws and Dolly, although a pretty minor subplot of the context of the film, it was just so remarkably handled. The actors took what in the script was maybe a half a paragraph total of direction and dialog and made it the most memorable thing to ever enter into the movie. I know I am making a big deal out of it, but, if you don't think it's a big deal, then you really missed the movie. I pity you for that. But if you see what it really is, the greatness of it, then there's hope for you. The 180 Jaws brought about in Jaws by this young lady (called Dolly) is astounding. Odd-job (GoldFinger), Grant(FRWL), and Stamper (TND) are all big henchmen who wouldn't possibly do such a thing in a convincing way. Maybe someday in a future Bond film, we'll see Jaws and Dolly again, married with two or three kids, bump into Bond, maybe invite him to a BBQ or just say hi.",Moonraker

""Sir Roger Moore's distaste at the shooting scene is quite genuine. In his autobiography, Moore expressed an extreme dislike for bloodsports, and a reticence about guns.""
>>-**** However? Roger Moore's 007 is so ruthless as to be almost sociopathic. A woman helps him in the beginning of the film. She is not a villain. After, 007 just flies away to South America not caring what happened to her and she is killed horribly (Off Camera) by trained attack dogs. The actor Roger Moore would always say that he disliked guns and in this movie only fired once and killed a sniper that is getting ready to kill 007. However, to have his character just leave this woman to be killed for helping Bond. And to be killed by trained attack animals? And she is not even a villain? She is being killed for helping him. Forget about not using a gun. This type of brutal lethal ruthlessness ruined what could have been a truly great 007 Film. Roger Moore should have insisted that 007 NOT desert this woman. There should have been a re-write. Here is Moore complaining about using handguns while leaving this scene in the movie. I could never understand this. It ruined the movie for me. The rest is exceptional.",Moonraker
183,jubilee77,James Bond at his.....er.....er.,7,25 November 2008,"Seems to me that James Bond was at his worst in Moonraker as some film critics would say and there appears to be a lot of flaws about this film. I have seen it loads of times and there obviously appears to be lots of good points about it and the plots worked out well while in other parts of the film's length, there are some weaknesses. I like the country settings particularly when set in Venice and Rio whereas the settings of Drax's ""stately mansion"" would actually have been impossible to be set in a heart of a Southern Californian vineyard or dessert as he would have been living in Las Vegas-style luxury instead while a giant 7.1 Richard Kiel steals the show with a second and one more appearance as a lovable steel-toothed henchman called Jaws. Around that time, much to his own embarrassment, Roger Moore had to complete two other films (North Sea Hyjack and Escape to Athena) that were issued the same year as Moonraker, neither of them were a success in the box office but a disaster and was this coupled with the reason why the critics rated Moonraker as ""underrated"" and a worst James Bond film and Roger Moore being either a typecast and can't act? In some philosophical point of view, this had little to do with the typecast actor's acting abilities but mainly due to ""landing quite by accident"" in some silly film plot that just didn't work of some kind.",Moonraker

Yes, it does frequently descend into silliness but the locations, action, glamour and cinematography make up for the lapses.

186,DMP-2,Roger Moore's worst and the worst of all,1,30 April 2001,"Roger Moore's Bond career started on a swing similar to Sean Connery's. Sean Connery started of fairly well with Dr. No (1962) and Moore started of fairly well with Live & Let Die (1973). Connery followed up not-so well, but not badly with From Russia With Love (1963) and Moore followed suit with The Man With The Golden Gun (1974). Then Sean Connery then went over the top with his smash Goldfinger (1964) and Moore did the same with The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). But then we come to this film where it changes. Connery's 4th Bond film, Thunderball (1965) became his greatest film. For Moore's 4th Bond film he goes ahead of Connery and makes Connery's 5th film ""You Only Live Twice"" (until this came out, YOLT (1967) was Connery's worst and the worst of all.) and so we get this stinker and unfortunately Moore never really recaptured the luck he had with The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), although he did come close with For Your Eyes Only (1981).      There are a number reasons for the errors with this film. First of all, the film is virtually a re-make of The Spy Who Loved Me (1977).  The return of Jaws is a  devastating disappointment, but probably the best part of the movie. Although the hype of the phase ""JAWS IS BACK"" is probably the reason it was Moore most financially successful. Actually it was also the last Bond film to receive an Academy Award nomination. The Bond girls were excellent especially Lois Chiles and Corrine DuFour's performances. The comedy is probably the most mild part of the film. There are some great action sequences though.        I also was personally disappointed with the film, because I expected judging by the VIDEO COVER Picture that it was going to a JAMES BOND MEETS SCI-FI which could have been excellent. Star Wars (1977) and Close Encounters Of A Third Kind (1977) also unintentionally helped make this film fail. Because they were so good (so good I think they stole a lot of Academy Awards from The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) I think the producers want to make Bond better than those films. But thats like comparing The Godfather (1972) and Jaws (1975), they're to different even though they are both great.
   Thats largely where they failed. Also they obviously didn't plan on making this one right away anyway, because at the end of ""SPY"" it says Bond will return in ""FOR YOUR EYES ONLY"". That possibly jinxed the operation, but when For Your Eyes Only (1981) did come out luckily it corrected the previous mistake, but hurt the Bond series lightly. The 80's saw some of the worst Bond films (with the exceptions of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (1981), The Living Daylights (1987), and Licence To Kill (1989), although they didn't make much money in comparison to others, but they were still good). The Bond hype wouldn't return until Pierce Brosnan's GoldenEye (1995). But, I still say watch it worth seeing just because it is not just Moonraker, its JAMES BOND XI",Moonraker
187,rutherfordh-81993,"Good, but not great",7,3 December 2020,"Moonraker had a tough job after being the film to take after The Spy Who Loved, me and on all accounts it was a very successful film. The special effects are great in this, but some parts of the story let it down. It isn't as exciting in many cases, and the action isn't as strong. The villain is played very well, but seems to be weaker than others, and the story seems very far-fetched, even for a Bond film. However, there are positives such as the scenes in Brazil, and it is overall strong.",Moonraker

189,sterlinrivera-2000,"Different Idea, Unique Film",9,21 January 2020,"Moonraker is a rather different kind of James Bond film, but is still interesting and unique all the way through.This time, James Bond (Roger Moore) investigates a space shuttle that has been hijacked and teams up with the beautiful CIA agent Holly (Lois Chiles) to stop the vicous Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) who plans to destroy humanity on Earth. Bond and Holly travel to outer space and do everything they can to foil his plans.Moonraker was different because half of the film was your usual awesome James Bond film, while the other half is like a big spce adventure that was very neat. I liked the story and the idea behind that and the visuals for space were very nice for 1979. This came out after Star Wars, so space visuals were still looking very good.The acting was awesome from everyone. Roger Moore was amazing yet again, Lois Chiles was awesome as Holly, and Micharl Lonsdale made for a rather cool villan. Richard Kiel comes back as Jaws, and like Spy Who Loved Me, Jaws made for a really unique secondary villan.The action in this one is really good. It has your usual James Bond action, and then they put it into space in the second half which made things very intriguing.Bottom line, Moonraker is a unique and interesting Bond film.",Moonraker
190,connorbbalboa,The nadir of the Roger Moore Bond films.,1,15 February 2017,"This is easily the worst of the Moore James Bond films.The plot this time is that Bond is investigating the disappearance of ""Moonraker"" ships constructed by Drax Industries with the help of Dr. Holly Goodhead (*shudder*), and uncovers a plan by Hugo Drax to destroy all human life on Earth except those individuals he sees as most fit, and create a new space civilization. Sound familiar? Well, that's because the plot is so similar to the previous film, The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), which was about the main villain, Karl Stromberg, wanting to destroy all human life on ground level and create a civilization beneath the sea. Different element, but both civilizations are in places supposedly uninhabitable by humans. I get that a lot of the Bond films copy plot elements from each other, but copying almost the exact plot from its immediate predecessor is just desperate. Even The Spy Who Loved Me is said to have taken numerous plot elements from a Sean Connery Bond film, You Only Live Twice (1967), but the former turned out to be a better film. Moore, as usual, is trying his darndest, and he can't really be blamed for the crappy material he has to work with. Lois Chiles as Goodhead (*shudder*) has one of the stupidest names for a Bond girl, and although she can fight o.k., she's just terribly dull. Richard Kiel returns from the previous film as Jaws, but here he is more of an annoyance, like many other henchmen from inferior Bond films, showing up all the time and not going away. Not only that, but he is turned into a complete joke, being a good guy, falling in love with a dorky girl, and speaking...Why is he speaking now when he showed no previous indication that he was capable of it? Michael Lonsdale's Drax is completely uninteresting as a villain because of how ripped-off he is from Stromberg and he doesn't seem to be making much of an effort to kill Bond properly (sure, that's a thing with many Bond villains, but he doesn't even try here; also, who's he trying to be, Hitler, with his talk of a master race?) A lot of things seem to happen conveniently for both Bond and his enemies. They all have gadgets (some quite stupid) for any situation. Bond himself seems to piece together clues much too easily, and that's partly due to Drax's poor efforts to kill him. There are also so many terrible jokes and puns not just by Bond this time, but other characters as well. When everyone watches Bond and Goodhead (*shudder*) have sex at the end, Q (Desmond Llewelyn) says that Bond is ""attempting re-entry."" Hmm.... A lot of the in-jokes are unwelcome and completely random. For instance, Before Bond goes to meet Q in an old Western-looking town, he is wearing Clint Eastwood's outfit from his Spaghetti westerns.True, there is a lot of spectacle, especially with the final battle in space, and others do commend the film for that, but to be honest, I really don't care. No amount of spectacle or incredible effects work will grab me if a film has no integrity to it, and this film has none. Even film series like Bond and Friday the 13th have standards, guys. By trying to take advantage of the Star Wars madness that originated two years earlier, what we get here is a stupid, ridiculous, lazy, and calculated film with nothing to show except spectacle, and to be honest, even the spectacle's overblown.I'm not going to knock Bond fans for liking this film, because with six actors and 24 films with the character, so many different versions of him and his adventures have been shown to the world, and it's a constantly-changing franchise, so what's the point?",Moonraker
191,Foxtrot-Alpha777,All downhill from here.... until Daniel Craig at least.,1,9 August 2020,"For me Moonracker was the start of the demise of this franchise before it was recovered by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale. This was the first laughably bad Bond film but unfortunately not the last.Not only was this Roger Moore worse performance as Bond it was also a poorly constructed story based and some dodgy science fiction, liberally peppered with cheesy gags and inappropriate innuendo. Dr Goodhead...... really, I mean really?The special effects, even for its time, were incredibly bad to the point of being comical.. As this followed Star Wars by two years you would have thought a well establish and cash rich franchise such as Bond could outdo a small budget film (as it was then) like Star Wars, you would be wrong. In every respect Star Wars excelled in special effects where Moonraker was nothing but a joke. The zero gravity scenes are particularly good, well good in a bad way, walking slowly seems to be order of the day unless you are hanging around on wires ignoring basic scientific principles.My recommendation would be not to watch this or indeed any other Bond until Mr Craig took over.",Moonraker

195,Reef-Shark,Really? Has to be the only Bond I haven't liked,5,30 April 2009,"I thought for the longest time that I would be incapable *not* liking a James Bond film. From 'Diamonds Are Forever' to 'Die Another Day', there had not been a ""Bad"" Bond film that I didn't find some redeeming value in. I guess in an over twenty movie-long franchises I was bound to come across one that I wouldn't enjoy, and the day finally came. Moonraker is without a doubt the worst James Bond film I have ever seen. Everything about the film just comes across as wrong. From the random references to popular science-fiction films, to Moore using the same gadget to solve just about all his problems, this film feels like an exercise in camp, and pointlessness. These were present in other Moore films, but never were they as poorly used as in Moonraker.The plot is pathetic, and when Bond finally gets into space it really is worthless, as it only lasts about twenty minutes. The plot is almost non-existent, and the villain is one of the most forgettable ones in the franchise's history. Jaws also returns from 'The Spy Who Loves Me,' which does lead to one of my favorite Bond lines: ""All I know is his name is Jaws. He kills people."" Funny bit of dialogue, and often Moore does give good one-liners in this film, but they can't compare to the many bad bits of comic relief thrown in throughout.Only die-hard Bond fans should own this film. Yes, I purchased it, because I am a fan of the series, and like re-watching all the films on a fairly frequent basis, but I can say that Moonraker will be the one I return to most seldom, and will do so only with friends so that we can point fingers, laugh, and engage in conversation.It isn't a BAD action movie, I will give it that. But it IS a bad Bond film.",Moonraker
196,jonny_mcclatch,Very underrated in the grand scheme of things.,7,21 March 2020,"When people talk about the worst Bond movies, Moonraker tends to get the majority of the flak and i've found it to be very harsh for what isn't that bad of a film. As a huge fan especially of the Roger Moore films it would be easy for me to gloss over the flaws the film does have, but there are some in there. The thing people seem to forget is how small a part of Moonraker they are, something like the double-take pigeon/the ""Bondola"" scene (mainly the end actually since the chase itself wasn't that bad when it was still in the water at least). They're only a small segment of a very solid film, the main thing I wasn't keen on in the film was Jaws finding love. I actually like Jaws character change just not how it was handled, it seemed too easy or rushed. Beyond that I think people went in disliking the premise of a Bond movie in space, perhaps felt like they were trying to cash in on Star Wars popularity with a film that wouldn't compete compared to that juggernaut.In retrospect the only fault for me with any part of those scenes was the astronaut space battle which was a bit too much and lacked the quality Star Wars managed nearly 2 years beforehand. But everything else was very well done, the space station, flying spacecrafts and docking scenes all worked brilliantly. If they just cut the fight in space and just had them dock and fight onboard which they essentially did anyway. It would have looked a lot more polished and less like a copycat.With all of that out of the way, there is a lot in there worth seeing. Like I said, some of the scenes in space are actually pretty good... even the build up prior to the launch of the Moonrakers. Hugo Drax has to be probably the most underrated villain in the franchise, unlike Stromberg he isn't made forgettable by Jaws and his death isn't just there to tie up loose ends. In fact his death scene is brilliant, it could have been too cartoonish like the death of Kananga just a few films ago. But it was handled far better and Bond's joke is also funnier in this instance. There are a lot of beautiful set pieces and locations, Drax's estate, his Amazon base, the centrifuge chamber, the space station even his lab in Venice. A short but sweet chase in the Amazon? scenes in Venice and Rio, they don't get enough appreciation.Dr Goodhead, like everything and everyone else in this film is another underrated character. I'll admit the name was a poor choice, perhaps a bit too over the top even for Bond but this is a franchise that already had Pussy Galore unironically. But she's the first Bond girl who didn't instantly fall into Bond's arms and intellectually is a match for Bond to the point she actually saves him. There are also a few other underrated scenes within Moonraker, the demise of Corrine Dufour, the Sugarloaf cable car sequence but most of all the entire opening scene. The opening sequence alone is worth watching this entire film, it has stunt work that Bond movies have long since shied away from and it's one of the best stunts in the whole franchise.",Moonraker
197,tomasg-69814,More Pompously Than Ever.,6,31 January 2016,"There was not much left of Ian Fleming's novelty original character James Bond by 1979. A pretty satisfied Roger Moore flesh out his modern fashion suits between the tiring pun, never even bother to draw his PPK once. By then the most expensive 007 movie so far - of course - but hundreds of miles from being discussed even in the mid rankings of all Bonds.I think time ran out for that vaulting joinery the film team had become, and the competition with contemporary big-time movies made the producers lose some genuine Bond feeling on the way. In all it feels a little paradoxical, this Moonraker movie.But it entertains all right, no question about that. A twelve year old today still can enjoy this to the fullest. But it is kind of a patchwork, with the ""traveling around the world"" theme, and the action scenes feels like more of fill-ins when the dialogue loses it's way.But now to all my joys of Moonraker:-The opening ""parachute"" scene is still a legendary classic, even by today's standards. Nowadays they just can computerize such scene.-The return of Jaws was a master stroke by the scriptwriters. He's needed when the movie sometimes ""fall asleep."" The bloodthirstiness is there for a start, then lacks considerable....-CIA wonder woman Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead. (My god, what a name. Ranks among the Goodnight's and Christmas's in 007 history.) Pretty as a picture; they straightened her natural curly hair just to get her Holly-look to feel right. As a participant of the world-wide popular TV-show ""DALLAS"" some year after this, she was allowed to show her natural hairdo (and bikini-filled curves) as another ""Holly"", this time oil-business Harwood. -Michael Lonsdale does a great, psychic villain, with the ordinary grandiloquent plans. Cold and designing as we want them.-The returning of the ""bottle-man"" from TSWLM (now in Venice.) Catches some of the essential mood of this 007-era. Was to return for full-filling a triple appearance.-The bawled ending - who surely was half the budget - is quite good, not to say real excellent by then standards.

200,jackhamel1987,Yet another blip!,6,7 April 2013,"Just as Bond recaptured the magic with The Spy who Loved Me, along came Moonraker, which was brought out in a rush because of the success of Star Wars. Sadly, this film and the quality of the finish really does reflect the producer's desperation to capitalize on it, and Moonraker slips into the reals of farce, though not as badly as it might have done if it had not been for some decent action scenes before the entrance into space.A space shutting belonging to Hugo Drax is stolen in mid-air, and because it happened on MI6's watch, Bond is sent to investigate. Bond discovers very quickly that Drax himself is behind the theft, and must quickly find out why. This takes him to Venice, where he discovers a laboratory that is manufacturing a very deadly nerve gas that harms only humans. He immediately reports this, and M visits himself, only to find that Drax has had the whole place cleared up as part of a cover up. Bond then travels ti Rio, where with the help of CIA agent Holly Goodhead, they discover the Drax is moving things further into the Amazon for a secret reason. He also discovers that his old foe, Jaws, is alive and well and now working for Drax. Eventually, Bond and Goodhead find themselves at a secret launch base in the Amazon, where they are blasted into Space because Drax has a large space station there, where he can kill everyone on Earth and repopulate it. As you can tell, this plot doesn't cut it. Yes, Connery nearly made it to Space in You only Live Twice, but that film had a far stronger plot than Moonraker, which leaves far, far too many holes in it's plot, and has too much farce (the double take on the pigeon, the classical music during Venice, the jokey CIA gadgets). Ultimately, it just loses the point. The plot is just to thin, and offers absolutely nothing new to the franchise even with Bond going into Space (an idea too far for a spy, I think). Still, this is not without some good points, thankfully. There are some great actions scenes between the rubbish. The fight between Bond and Chang in Venice is first rate, as is the Cable Car fight between Bond and Jaws. There's also a reasonable boat chase, though you do feel that it's a bit of a rehash of older Bonds, rather than a fresh Bond film.Another positive note is the villain, Hugo Drax, who I do rather like because of his understated, totally ruthless outlook. ""Look after Mr Bond. See that some harm comes to him"". A good line, from a decent villain. A nice laugh for Sunday afternoon, I think. 6/10.",Moonraker

Tonight was Moonraker, so I put the DVD in and expected the worst. Everyone who knocks this one need to loosen up! Sure it's stupid and easily the most absurd Bond movie, but I still found it very entertaining. Bond is hardly a realistic show. Even the most realistic Bond movies are still 50% fantasy. Obviously Moonraker isn't the best Bond movie, but it's still a very entertaining way to spend 2 hours.To put it simply, I probably wouldn't have purchased it seperately, but I'm certainly not annoyed about it being included in the 007 box set.I rate this one at 6/10",Moonraker
202,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,Could have been better (SPOILERS),4,24 October 2004,"In the world of James Bond, most mainstream audiences see the British secret agent as a comic-book superhero who can survive anything, court any woman, and save the world from destruction while holding a martini glass in one hand. Such people would then appreciate films like ""You Only Live Twice"", ""Die Another Day"", and 1979's ""Moonraker. Of all the Bond films, these particular three are the most outrageous and it's for that reason why they're not among my favourites. For this review, I'll focus on ""Moonraker"", a film that, despite it's positives, is still mostly a failure.The best part of the whole movie is the beginning: the pre-credits sequence features Bond (Roger Moore, in his fourth appearance) being thrown out of a plane in midair and having to catch up to a villain who has the only parachute. It's a thrilling scene that's fantastically shot and is appropriately on numerous ""best-of"" lists. After the average song and titles, we're introduced to the main plot: it turns out that a space shuttle on loan to Britain from the U.S. was skyjacked and Bond is sent to the shuttle's manufacturer in California, the Drax Corporation, on a diplomatic mission and to investigate the plant. He soon realizes that the company's founder, Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) is up to more than meets the eye and that his refined demeanor is simply an act.There are two main problems with the movie: it's similarity to the previous outing, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", and the sci-fi influence of ""Star Wars"". On the former, I usually don't mind if a Bond film is similar to another; TSWLM is a rehash of ""You Only Live Twice"", yet it's still one of my favourites. But two films in a row with the exact same plot (and in some cases, nearly identical scenes) shows laziness on the part of the producers. That brings me to my next complaint: the space angle. Granted, the idea itself isn't too bad and it only takes up the final half hour. I only wish that Albert R. Broccoli had been a little more creative in developing the plot, instead of just repackaging TSWLM in outer space.This plot also demands that the crew create convincing special effects, but perhaps their aims were too ambitious because the movie failed to amaze me. While there are some innovative uses of models and they do look realistic, they don't jump out from the screen as they're meant to. ""Moonraker"" also contains the infamous laser gun, and those effects are downright horrible. In other words, there's no real 'wow' factor, which is a shame because, ironically, the cinematography is fantastic.It's the minor areas where ""Moonraker"" shines. The production design (from Bond veteran Ken Adam) is top notch, with Drax's estate and the space station interiors being highlights. The make-up effects/costumes are suitably out-of-this-world, and even the sound effects are worthy of a mention. Plus, John Barry scores another beautifully haunting soundtrack that perfectly accompanies the wonderful locations featured in the movie: from Venice to Rio de Janeiro to the Amazon. But the film struggles in more important matters: namely, the script, the direction, and the cast.Returning to pen his second (and last) Bond screenplay is Christopher Wood, who definitely had more success with ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". As I said before, ""Moonraker"" is an almost exact copy of the previous film and Wood's storyline is fairly uninspired; if anything, his strength comes in the dialogue, which is some of the wittiest and most quotable in the series (as well as the most tasteless). Consequently, Bond isn't given any real depth and only seems to be there to follow the by-the-numbers plot. Fortunately, while Roger Moore's performance isn't on par with his best, he still manages to keep the film afloat somewhat. Then there are his co-stars, who are less impressive.The love interest of the film is Dr. Holly Goodhead, played with little flair by Lois Chiles. Other than the name, the character isn't exactly the most memorable and the actress doesn't make it any better by delivering all of her lines in the same monotonous voice. As the villainous madman Drax, French actor Michael Lonsdale is a worthy opponent. While the character is a carbon copy of Karl Stromberg from TSWLM, the actor manages to not only look menacing in every frame, but the way that he says even the most banal of lines will leave the viewer in stitches. So it's fortunate that the film's best lines belong to Lonsdale.Unfortunately, one of the highlights of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", Jaws, returns and his involvement in ""Moonraker"" is anything but welcome. The once imposing villain is reduced to a bumbling oaf who is the punch line to numerous failed gags and who induces groans rather than fear. The secondary henchman, Chang, is forgettable and only serves as a minor irritation that is disposed of in an admittedly first-class fight scene. Finally, special note must be given to Bernard Lee, who played M in the first eleven films of the series. ""Moonraker"" would be the actor's final film (he passed away shortly before production started on ""For Your Eyes Only"") and he gives the usual excellent performance.If I could blame one person for the movie's faults, it would probably be director Lewis Gilbert. While Cubby Broccoli was responsible for the lion's share of what happened on screen, Gilbert's extravagantly uneven tone is also to blame. The film is almost permanently veered towards slapstick but deadpan scenes such as the ones featuring the G-force simulator or a vicious dog mauling, while both brilliant, are completely out of place in a movie that nearly doubles as a comedy. Nothing is wrong with a little bit of humour in a Bond filmthe trick is not to overdo it. ""Moonraker"" crosses that line far too many times and it unfortunately doesn't pay off. 4/10",Moonraker
203,asdodge,Wasn't Great to begin with; ages poorly,4,12 December 2008,"While ""Moonraker"" is not awful, it challenges ""A View to a Kill"" and ""Die Another Day"" as cheesiest and worst Bond movies. Moore is up to par in this film which starts off well enough- a space shuttle is sabotaged/stolen and Bond must find out why. However, the movie devolves into poor jokes, unbelievable plot lines and a Star Wars impersonation. Lois Chiles plays Dr. Holly Goodhead, and though supposedly educated and an equal of Bond's, she comes across as a bratty 12-year-old. Outside of the return of Jaws, the henchmen are meager and uninspiring. Without giving the story away, the villain, Drax, is intent on destroying the world and creating a master race. Bond does some investigative work to learn what Drax is up to and then must work to stop him. Some scenes and the climax are just too out of touch with reality and the ability to suspend disbelief is crippled too much to let this movie pass as a good Bond film. The early part, as Bond tries to figure out who Drax is and what is really going on are good (except for a lab suddenly disappearing overnight), but once the meat of the plot is reached, the action and cheesy effects throw the story into a spiral. The movie didn't work then and it doesn't work now. This definitely ranks as one of the lamest of the Bond movies. Maybe worth the price of admission in 1978 and, if you are a Bond fan, you want all of them, but this is one you leave on the shelf unless in the mood to watch them all in order.",Moonraker

205,TheFilmFreak1,The Moonraker Blows,5,15 April 2014,"Most agree that the 70s was not kind to 007. It was an age of dramatic change and rebellion, where the auteur and the art-house were fully realised as commodities and the exploitation genre arose from a lack of the social inhibition that the previous decades so delicately cultivated. The Bond films, too civilised to be exploitation and too mainstream to be art-house, had simply lost their audience. That was until 1977's The Spy Who Loved Me, which shocked many by embracing the uniqueness of Bond instead of limply re-contextualising the spy in then popular genres like Blaxploitation and Kung-Fu. It was fresh, it was inventive, it was over-the-top, and it was strangely poignant in regards to the treatment of Roger Moore's lothario Bond. It was, in short, a resurrection, attracting rave reviews and great box office.So producer Albert R. 'Cubby' Broccoli, having made Bond cool again, was faced with the unenviable task of preserving said coolness. So what does he do? He makes the same film IN SPACE! Enter 1979's Moonraker. And let me tell you, dear readers, I'm not joking about this being the same film. As a bit of an interesting exercise, try comparing the opening sequences of 'Moonraker' and 'Spy'. Perhaps you may notice a few similarities, like the villain hijacking a vehicle, M asking for 007 and instead getting an innuendo, Bond being lured into a honey trap by villains who want him dead for vaguely defined reasons, and finally Bond in free fall until the last minute when he suddenly has a parachute. Yeah, original.And the similarities don't end there! You also get a billionaire Blofeld surrogate (this one played rather well by Michael Lonsdale) with a plot to destroy the world, Jaws, a rival intelligence agent as Bond girl, and a final scene where Bond embarrasses his superiors by engaging in a round of decidedly un-private fornication. I understand that a franchise as long running as the Bond series cannot avoid repetition, but this is ridiculous!Even where this film does distinguish itself from its predecessor, it is flagrantly ripping off Star Wars. The final thirty minutes of this picture essentially constitute the highlights of that picture with a smug, alcoholic, sex-crazed sociopath thrown into the mix. The special effects are laudable, but you barely notice for all the Megalodon-jumping camp they represent.And speaking of 'jumping the shark', what precisely were the producers thinking when they conceived of a hovercraft gondola? And a midget girlfriend for Jaws? AND A BLOODY DOUBLE-BLOODY-TAKE PIGEON!What I find particularly aggravating about this film, though, is how little it resembles the book it is based on. Ian Fleming's Moonraker was one of the better entries in his iconic espionage series, with a simple yet suspenseful plot and some good, old-fashioned racism against the Germans, and to not see it realised on the big-screen simply because it wasn't 'ambitious enough' for Broccoli's tastes is utterly infuriating.This is not my least favourite Bond film of the official series (because Never Say Never Again doesn't even deserve to be called a Bond film), but it certainly makes the bottom five. Even Roger Moore, who I unashamedly love as Bond, couldn't save it. In fact, his persona is so exaggerated for this installment that he comes dangerously close to being insufferable. The film does have some positive qualities – the mise-en-scene is lovely and John Barry delivers another superlative score (though his lyrics for the theme song are straight out of a George Lucas movie... how appropriate) – but in the end the whole product amounts to an utterly horrid piece of self-depreciating camp that revels in the fact it doesn't give a damn anymore about telling a compelling story.",Moonraker
206,nickkulstadis,Roger Moore's worst Bond movie,4,13 September 2021,"One of the worst Bond movies in the series. An egregious error of a Bond movie that not only is an obvious rehash of the vastly superior The Spy Who Loved Me but is also a blatant cash grab on Star Wars. This movie has no real driving force, just floating along merrily until they go to space in the last 25 minutes of this almost 2 hour 10 minute trainwreck. It's plot is merely an excuse to string together a bunch of silly scenes and the less said about Jaws becoming a bumbling cartoon character the better. This is a pathetic Bond movie. I can occasionally do Roger's cheesier Bond movies but this one, A View To A Kill and Octopussy are too much. This is down there with other weak installments like Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day, Licence To Kill, Spectre , A View To A Kill , Diamonds Are Forever and Octopussy. Thankfully For Your Eyes Only came after this movie. A vastly superior movie.",Moonraker
207,MovieCriticDave,Drive this Moonraker *into* the Moon.,4,12 August 2005,"There is perhaps no more telling a sign for the sheer awfulness of a film when critics start telling you that it isn't as bad as you ""might have heard."" So it is with ""Moonraker,"" a shamelessly Star Wars-influenced reconception of an Ian Fleming short story by the same name that richly deserves its relegation to the low end of the Bond pecking order.Moonraker pivots on the supposedly accidental destruction of an American space shuttle, inexplicably ""on loan"" to the British government (which is incapable of launching them, so why do they want one?). When prying eyes reveal the shuttle was stolen by its maker (in a manner factually impossible by virtue of the shuttle's design) as part of a broader plot, only James Bond can save the day. Too bad he couldn't save the whole movie.To be sure, Moonraker carries with it all the requisite elements of a Bond feature; a megalomaniacal villain (the dreadful Hugo Drax), the spectre of world destruction (purging humanity for a perfect race), and the only women on the planet named for the sake of double-entendre (Lois Chiles as Dr. Holly Goodhead). Yet when the lead villain's beard is more interesting than any of his dialog (Drax best line is ""Can I interest you in a cucumber sandwich, Mr. Bond"", and *that* gets repeated), Houston doesn't have to be told that ""we have a problem."" Hugo Drax is arguably the least intriguing villain of any Bond movie, and when he meets his inevitable demise, we breathe a sigh of relief not for the safety of Bond's earth, but for the notion that this silly space epic is crawling ever closer to its merciful conclusion.It's standard procedure to suspend your disbelief for any Bond film, but this one asks you to send it into a space vacuum. Beyond the sheer silliness of one man reposed with the manufacture of something the scope of a space shuttle is the notion that he would even need to steal them for his own malevolent purposes. Add to that the myriad ways Moonraker simply ignores the way the American space shuttle actually works, and you clearly have a movie stitched together like granny's quilt rather than one born of a sound screenplay.To be fair, Moonraker does hold serve in the tradition of wonderfully photographed and scored Bond films, and the in-space sequences are supported by some of the better special effects given the era of Moonraker's production. But it's not fair to expect these technical elements to carry an entire film, and they don't. For a spy adventure franchise that has given us movies as grand as Thunderball, as tense as For Your Eyes Only, and as politically relevant as Octopussy, Moonraker deservedly stands as a decided dud.",Moonraker
208,joseph t,It's fun...,7,24 April 2008,"I don't see why so many people are down on this movie. It's entertainment. It's fun. War and Peace it ain't. You want a serious movie with a deeper message then have a viewing of a classic like Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane or Wuthering Heights. You don't view Bond films for that. They're just escapism and entertainment. Enjoy them for that and you'll be a much happier person.That said, Moonraker delivers on the entertainment and fun aspect. Sure, there are some contrived sequences and corny lines, but those fall into the context of the fantasy. This movie has some tightly scripted and well-drawn action sequences, some nifty special effects (for it's era), a terrific score and title theme by Shirley Bassey, and a well-paced plot. The filming locations are lush and exotic, ranging from Southern California to Venice to Rio and the Amazon rain forest and, finally, outer space.The cast is the usual top-quality Bond ensemble. I have to say that Sir Roger Moore is my favorite James Bond actor. He brings a touch of light-hearted and subtle British humor to the role, unlike the Sean Connery incarnation, who was simply too much of the Serious Spy for me. And Lois Chiles as Holly Goodhead (there's a classic Bond name for you) is probably the most beautiful and sophisticated of the Bond girls. She scores an 11 on the 1-10 beauty scale, but also brings the added attraction of a brilliantly intelligent and accomplished woman to the role, more than the equal of James on that account, the kind of woman you could fall deeply in love with not only for her beauty but her intellect as well.'Moonraker' might not be a classic in the world of films, but it holds it's own in the Bond film rankings.",Moonraker
209,mcfische,Is this a Bond film? Could've fooled me,6,30 August 2003,"Could have spoilers""Moonraker"" was not intended to be the follow-up to the tired ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" ""For Your Eyes Only"" was to be the 11th James Bond adventure, but the success of Star Wars had Cubby Brocoli make the decision to take the villain, title, and nothing else from the novel and send Bond into space. Cubby maintained in the production that it wasn't science fiction; it was science fact. But that isn't the case, and this film both isolates itself from the rest of the films AND seems tired.To begin with, the story is good. Very good. But it's hidden beneath everything else in the film. The ridiculous attempts at humor in the script make the film very boring, and the overall plot of the villain; destroying the world and then re-creating it; is a carbon copy of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and even more ridiculous. Space shuttles existed then, but a space station like that and a space program that organized wasn't even thinkable back in the 1970s, and it doesn't even exist today. With everything that goes on the film, you don't think of it as a Bond picture. It's either an elaborate, overly-dramatic science fiction film or a drama with some science fiction in it.Roger Moore again gives a tired performance, and the female lead; CIA agent Holly Goodhead, is again rather pathetic. Yes, she's an astronaut and scientist, and she can fight, but why couldn't she fight the goons who knocked her and James out? The acting by the person in the role isn't Bond quality. Jaws's return was un-needed and he could've easily become Bond's ally without the worthless, puny girlfriend. A lot of the suspense and intrigue at the beginning of the film looks and feels good, but because of the tired feel of the film and actors, it doesn't really work.The film is better than TSWLM, however. Special effects of this sort belong in Star Wars, not 007, but you could never tell that the filmmakers didn't actually go up into space and shoot real spacecraft. The models and rewound camera techniques are far more impressive and believable than any kind of CGI used in the new Star Wars films. The music is very beautiful. The interesting thing about this film and TSWLM is that, while the films are tired, the music is exciting, enchanting, and everything the film was supposed to be. We have good performances by Q and Moneypenny as usual, General Gogol and Fredrick Grey reappear, and we have a beautiful farewell performance from Bernard Lee as M. In his best performance as the head of MI6, Lee's final scene; seeing 007's love-making to Goodhead, is a bit of a copy-off of TSWLM, but he does it so well. No one can replace the original M, who died of cancer after filming. Hugo Drax is a very interesting villain, with a very interesting death.The film gets 5 and 3/4 stars out of 10.",Moonraker

212,dmbjam29,Arguably the Worst James Bond Movie,4,2 May 2007,"In 1979, Roger Moore released his fourth film as James Bond and this film might have the infamous honor of being the worst in franchiseNothing in this film works. To begin with the plot is very weak, James Bond is sent to investigate the hijacking of a space shuttle and discovers that a megalomaniac is planning on eliminating all life on Earth. Secondly, the script is uninspiring. It seems Christopher Wood was attempting to set the record for bad one liners in a James Bond film. Thirdly, the acting was atrocious. Lois Chiles might have the distinction as one of the worst Bond girls as Dr. Goodhead. Her lines are so poorly delivered it's hard not to cringe.However the main reason for the movie's failure all falls on the director, Lewis Gilbert. After participating in previous Bond films you would think he would have more of an understanding to maintain the integrity of the franchise. The interaction between the characters is shockingly awkward. There seems to be no leadership behind the camera. The lines delivered from all actors are contrived and artificial.Also, all the scenes with potential turn into calamities. The opening sequence with Bond jumping out the plane is a great moment but then its ruined with cheesy music and Jaws flapping his arms and landing into a circus tent. By the end of the movie, it just becomes a joke. The story has so many holes and there's a laser fight in space! When did James Bond become a Star Wars movie?! The Force is definitely not with this film. A stain in the James Bond franchise.4 out of 10.",Moonraker
213,Mrbrown43,Moonraker: James Bond in SPPPPPPAAAAAACCCCCCEEEEE,3,28 December 2017,"The family and I have watched all the James Bond films way too many times. They always were mindless fun films that we could watch in a state of dumb happiness. The trouble with this mindset is when we ever question anything the film just falls apart. Moonraker might be one the worst examples of this in the Bond series, it is mindless fun but when you pay attention you realize that this is bad, really bad.After a Drax industries space shuttle ""Moonraker"" is hijacked from the US in midflight James Bond (Roger Moore) is sent to find out why it was hijacked and what happened to it, this sends Bond on a worldwide race against time to stop a power hungry mad man (Michael Lonsdale) from killing the entire human race.The first of the big problems with this movie is the writing, Bond as usual never really is in any danger as there is always some sort of invention from Q (Desmond Llewelyn) that saves him or just by the villains taking their time killing him or use such convoluted means to kill Bond that are and not limited to: placing him under a space shuttle to fry time, throw him into a pool with Python or send a Asian stereotype in Ninja dress up to beat up Bond. All of these could have been solved by just shooting Bond. The sheer stupidly of the villains is really frustrating because if they were just competent enough all their problems would have been fixed. But no, the film is always on Bond's side and as of a result there is not really much tension as nothing is able to truly harm him. The film is boring as a result if you want to pay attention. Another example would be the after Bond discovers a lethal drug that the villain is going to use to destroy the world. He returns to the factory with his superiors only to find it gone as embarrass himself and the superiors and only then gives them the lethal drug after the humiliation instead of before when it would have helped convince the higher ups that something is up.The second big problem is the dialogue, I know that James Bond tends to make quips and puns in a majority of films in movies, the Roger Moore films in particular are guilty of this but Moonraker takes the cake. I would say that 90% of Roger Moore's dialogue is lame stupid puns. Often one after another and not only that but they are not clever; just predicable things that almost anyone would have thought of as the first thing to write down. A door that would save Bond from death blows up ""Bang on time!"" Bond exclaims. Bond discovers a killer daily diary ""Fairly deadly diary"" he mutters with attempted droll. I would like to quote some lines from the villain and ask you to try adding the evil laugh to them ""Look after Mr Bond, see that some harm comes to him...."" ""I am sure Mr Bond is cold after his swim; put him in place where he will be assured of warmth...."" Most of the bad guy's dialogue is like that, I half expect him to bust out with maniacal laugher as thunder rolls outside. The villain is a cartoon character that the film does not want to admit is a cartoon because it still wants to be somewhat realistic, even when it is trying to be Star Wars and have Sci Fi elements but no. The film still wants to be taken seriously even with all the stupid punning and cartoon baddies.The third big problem is the acting, Roger Moore sleepwalks though movie, just doing enough to not seem that he is trying but not much more. All the female characters on the other hand give wooden performances. The only one that is on screen for longer than a few minutes is Holly Goodhead(Lois Chiles) who delivers her lines with as much weight and emotion as block of wood in water creates a sizzling chemical compound. Because that is what women are in the pre Daniel Craig (Pierce Brosnan to a lesser extent) they are not so much interesting characters or even allowed to give good performances but rather wooden dolls that Bond leers at and/or sleeps with before throwing them away. The female characters do not need to put in good performances before they are just things that look pretty. This aspect has damaged the films as the years have gone by and Moonraker is one of the worst offenders of this.The special effects are ok; they have aged alright for the most part even if the films idea of zero gravity is a little bit goofy it still looks impressive for a 1970s movie. As I write this I wonder why I have watched Moonraker all those times, on one hand this could go into the Hall of Infamy because of all the stupidity and questionable elements that contribute to the film aging badly. But it is still fun, mindless stupid fun. I doubt it is ever going to be better than that. I doubt history will look kindly on Moonraker. But I can recommend it as being a fun movie you can put on if you do not want something too intelligent.",Moonraker
214,GenXer,One of the Best.,9,6 October 2007,"It's interesting that some of the most beloved Bond films are also some of the worst (Thunderball, Diamonds Are Forever, For Your Eyes Only), and some of the most reviled are among the best (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moonraker, The Living Daylights).This movie set a new high in entertainment value when it was released in 1979. It was the necessary upgrade of the franchise in the new era ushered in by Star Wars a couple of years earlier. It preserved the best of the genre (espionage intrigue, plot twists, Bond mystique, beautiful women, gadgets, humor, haunting cinematography, and mesmerizing music), but brought them out of the gloomy and cynical Cold War atmosphere and into a more futuristic and optimistic format. It kept the Bond franchise fun at a time when the standards for fun had taken a quantum leap.Roger Moore does a nice job in his last credible portrayal of 007.

216,Robin-97,Double 0h-Please!,5,30 November 1999,"""Moonraker"" is far from a boring film, but I can think of few action pictures that have ever been more frustrating. What we have here is the opportunity for a tight, exciting, gloriously spectacular 007 adventure, but due to the filmmakers' decision to substitute juvenile humour for thrills at every opportunity, the final result is sporadically enjoyable at best, placing this overblown entry on the very bottom rung of the Bond ladder (well, the official Bond ladder anyway - at least it's still miles ahead of ""Never Say Never Again""). Keen observers may notice that the end credits of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" stated ""James Bond Will Return in 'For Your Eyes Only'"". And if you'll pardon the pun, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the success of a little film called ""Star Wars"" inspired the producers to send 007 to outer space instead.Needless to say, that decision was a far cry from Ian Fleming's original vision. His original novelization of ""Moonraker"" was a solid page-turner about an megalomaniacal villain's scheme to fire a nuclear rocket into the heart of London and even contained a scene where Bond almost makes the shocking decision to sacrifice his own life to save the city. This time, the villain wants to wipe out all life on earth and start his own utopia of perfect human specimens. Of course, ludicrous storylines like this are what make the Bond franchise what it is, but this is probably the only entry in the series that actually manages to be MORE silly than the ""Austin Powers"" films that spoof it. The first half hour gives an indication of how much better the film might have been had it played things more straight. Things start off dynamically with a breathtaking sky-diving sequence that is undoubtedly one of the best teasers in the series and also earns high marks later on for a scene in which Bond is trapped helplessly on a G-force simulator. It is one of the very few instances in the series where 007 is left too shaken up to even utter a one-liner, but unfortunately, this is the ONLY moment in the film where an action setpiece is not completely obliterated by an overuse of low, cornball humour and juvenile sight gags.
By the time ""Moonraker"" has reached its outer space finale, all suspense has been drained away and the flashy battle sequence, while undoubtedly expensive, is pretty underwhelming, especially when compared to the climactic setpieces in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"". The supporting cast also does little to enhance the proceedings. Lois Chiles is awfully wooden as the aptly-named heroine, Dr. Holly Goodhead, and Michel Lonsdale, despite having a great deal of witty dialogue (""Take good care of Mr. Bond. See that some harm comes to him""), is one of the more dull Bond villains, mainly because he speaks in monotone throughout the entire film and doesn't even seem to truly relish his evil schemes. And then there's the character of Jaws, who was arguably the most memorable Bond villain of them all in ""TSWLM"", but has his credibility completely shattered here. The character is now portrayed as an inane buffoon who could never stop 007 if his life depended on it, and a scene midway through in which he suddenly falls head-over-heels in love has got to be the most embarrasing moment in the entire series, bar none! As you can imagine, I didn't much care about anything that happened in the film after that, which pretty much sums why ""Moonraker"" is so frustrating. 007 has always held a license to be as he silly as he wants, but this particular entry demonstrates that boundaries DO have to be drawn somewhere. You know you're in the trouble when it gets to the point where the appearance of Mini-Me would lend more credibility to the proceedings!",Moonraker
217,Orpington,"Bond reaches space, but the series crashes to Earth",3,9 September 2003,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSI suppose it seemed like a good idea at the time. Star Wars had just become a huge box office phenomenon, the success of The Spy Who Loved Me had just put the Bond franchise back on track, so why not make a sci-fi OO7 adventure? From a commercial perspective the decision paid off, because Moonraker became one of the biggest grossing Bond films at the cinemas, but this really has to be the worst film in the entire series. After a promising start it descends into a pit of ever-increasing silliness and self-parody, completing the transition of James Bond from suave and sophisticated superspy to a smirking cartoon character, and I would not be surprised if the whole fiasco left Ian Fleming spinning in his grave.To give the film its due, it does start off quite well. The opening sky diving sequence is pretty spectacular, and Bond's first encounter with supervillain Hugo Drax is entertaining, featuring some witty one-liners. It is also the only point in the film that Bond's life appears genuinely in danger, when Drax's henchman tries to kill him in a space flight simulator. This scene is one of the rare occasions in the whole of Roger Moore's reign as OO7 where he actually looks scared and near death, and it proves that Moore can act when he wants to. Unfortunately, for the rest of Moonraker he is back in semi-detached eyebrow-raising mode, strolling through the film with tongue relentlessly in cheek as the story becomes more and more absurd.It is when Bond travels to Venice that things start becoming really silly, with the gondola episode and the infamous double-taking pigeon. After that it is downhill all the way, as we are treated to such delights as Jaws becoming a good guy and falling in love with a nerdish little girl with blonde pigtails, Bond fighting a very unconvincing snake and, to cap it all, a laser fight in space! This last scene must represent the absolute nadir of the Bond series, and it hammers the final nail in the film's coffin. In his previous two Bond films director Lewis Gilbert had favoured a lavish and OTT feel, but in Moonraker he goes too far, turning Bond into a joke. The storyline is laboured and silly as well, with Drax's predictable and absurd plan to destroy the world a carbon copy of Stromberg's in The Spy Who Loved Me, and even more unconvincing. Even Shirley Bassey's theme song is dull and tired, although John Barry's eerie incidental music is quite good.The cast is not especially memorable either. Michel Lonsdale makes quite a good Bond villain, and has the best lines, but he is hardly the most original or distinctive foe OO7 has encountered. The return of Jaws, meanwhile, is a big mistake, for the joke of his invincibility had already worn thin by the end of TSWLM, and does not feel any fresher here; as for his ""love"" scenes with his cartoonish girlfriend, they are just embarrassing. The film scores no higher on the Bond girl front, with the wooden and relentlessly uncharismatic Lois Chiles making Barbara Bach look like a top-class actress. Chiles is not as bad as Britt Ekland or Tanya Roberts, but she certainly comes close. The only actor who lends any real dignity to proceedings is Bernard Lee, making his final appearance as M before he succumbed to cancer. Lee remains the definitive M, and to this day the Bond series misses his crusty gravitas.Bond films, even the toughest and grittiest ones, do have an element of fantasy about them. The very best Bonds, however, do at least have some connection to the real world and a measure of believability. Moonraker has neither, and takes OO7 way too far over the border line between fantasy and reality, cheapening the character in the process. Thankfully, no Bond film since has ever reached the same heights of absurdity or stupidity, and hopefully never will.",Moonraker
218,ymamedy,2 hours well spent.,10,6 September 2001,"This review may contain spoliers.Roger Moore makes his fourth appearance as James Bond in this big-budget adventure.  He seems to have settled into the role by now and the actor exudes confidence.  Although Moonraker is often degraded for being overly fatuous, it is a highly entertaining adventure that epitomises Moore's light-hearted portrayal of Bond.The opening sequence is very shrewd and is only spolied at the close by the inappropriate comical actions of Jaws.  Maurice Binder fails to produce an innovative title sequence and this one looks dated and two-dimensional. John Barry's musical scores are below par and they fail to augment the drama of the film.The plot is credible even though I am nonplussed at why Bond immediately thought that Drax was responsible for the hijack of the shuttle after he received his mission briefing.  Drax's apocalyptic plot should present Bond with his toughest challenge yet, but the movie fails to exploit this and therefore the drama is often flat.  The locations are impressive and Bond spends a lot of time travelling from the US to Venice and then onto Rio de Janeiro before he heads into the Brazilian jungle and then into space.  You can't help but feel that 007 should stay in one place for longer.The tone of this review is somewhat disparaging but the movie does have its high points.  Q's wrist-dart-gun proves to be useful to 007 and Lois Chiles is very effective as Bond's sidekick, even if 007 does go out of his way to be cringingly chauvinistic at times.  Didn't he learn anything from Major Amasova in the previous offering?  Most of the action takes place on terra firma and therefore learns from the mistakes of Thunderball.After a stuttering start, the Moore mobile was in cruise mode for this film and it would continue to be for several films to come.  Moonraker shows THE James Bond in action.  Enjoy!",Moonraker
219,Bel Ludovic,Subtlety and understatement not strong points here,5,2 December 2002,"Blame Star Wars'. It could have been so very different, but EON Productions got ideas above their station and decided to send Bond to space, in order to compete with one 1977 blockbuster and outdo the other. The plot might have been sinister were it not so far-fetched, though somehow it is better executed than the equally preposterous Die Another Day. That aside, Moonraker could easily have got away with it, had better editing stripped the movie of some of its more awful moments. (Spoilers ahead). The visual gags are terrible and profoundly unfunny, serving only to lower the tone; the product placement is obscene; the return of Jaws and his ability to survive just about anything is ill-advised, and whoever came up with idea of an amply-breasted pigtailed love interest for the lumbering giant should be pelted with rancid tomatoes. Without these detriments, some of the stronger elements in Moonraker would have stood out more prominently. Drax is an excellent villain who bags all the best lines, delivered with beautifully understated acidity. The scene where Corinne is set upon by dogs for her betrayal is superbly executed, and Roger Moore plays it straight in an early scene where his life is genuinely at risk  he emerges from his vestibule of death too shaken to even murmur a smarmy quip. He's good throughout, in fact, comfortable in the role, but likeable rather than menacing, and not given much to get his teeth into. The special effects in space are fine, considering it was 1979, and John Barry's score during the space scenes are sublime. At times Moonraker is a gloriously escapist travelogue of lush locations - with a seemingly endless bevy of beautiful women draped across the scenery - rather than a gritty espionage thriller, but is it the worst Bond film ever? Well, according to some Bond fans' criteria, it possibly is. But it is guiltily enjoyable, in a vacuous way. There are probably better' Bond films that I've enjoyed less than this one, but I think most people can agree that reigning in the series for the next film For Your Eyes Only' was the only sensible course of action.",Moonraker

221,davidm-2,Wraps off a rather depressing decade for Bond,7,9 February 1999,"While maligned by many Bond enthusiasts, ""Moonraker"" is certainly a fun, visually compelling film.  Released when such late 1970s blockbusters as ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters"" were rekindling an interest in outer space, the movie should be seen as a reflection of its time, right down to the outrageous outer space scene and the disco music.  It is arguably the second-best Bond film of the decade after ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""Notice the shameless promotion of commercial products throughout the film--British Airways, Air France, and 7-Up (after the cable car crashes into the wall in Rio, the only thing left standing is a 7-Up cooler!). Also, Drax certainly has a British accent for someone who hates Britain.",Moonraker
222,mdouglasfresno,...while Ian Fleming spins in his grave...,1,3 February 2007,"To even include this monstrosity of a movie in a catalog of Jame Bond films borders on travesty. This was NOT Bond! This was simply a sorry attempt to cash-in on the space craze started by Star Wars, and complete the process of turning Bond into a comic-book character. Fleming's Bond (or even Eon's early Bond incarnation, as played by Sean Connery) is by now totally unrecognizable. He's not a secret agent (and government-sanctioned assassin) but a jet-setting playboy crime-fighter who stumbles from one action set-piece to another. Roger Moore's Bond is a total lightweight, and comes across about as credible as Inspector Gadget. Maybe that's fitting, because ""Moonraker"" is far more a filmed cartoon than a spy thriller.True, ""Moonraker"" didn't begin the slide from Fleming's vision into comic-strip, but did it accelerate it! You could even say that ""Moonraker"" ran the series right into the ground, so naturally there was no where else to go but ""up"" for the next entry, ""For Your Eyes Only"". ""Moonraker"" is absolute rock-bottom for the entire series, what with a totally outlandish plot, overblown futuristic sets straight out of ""Star Trek"", one-dimensional characters who are as thin as cardboard, and (most embarrassing of all) ill-advised attempts at broad humor.The plot is senseless and ridiculous. True, Fleming's novel was horribly dated by 1979, but ANYTHING would have been better than what Christopher Wood finally dreamed up. Drax plotting to destroy all life on earth and breed a new generation of perfect people under his rule in a space station??? Does this make ANY sense??? All the action sequences are only tired re-workings of previous movies (far too many to list, but suffice to say that I saw elements of virtually every previous Bond flick made to date). And if this rehash wasn't enough, they even went so far as to bring back the ""crowd-pleaser"" of the previous film, Jaws. Jaws made a mildly interesting villain for one movie, but trying to sustain menace into a 2nd appearance just doesn't work -- you get the feeling that both Bond AND Jaws are completely indestructible, so where's the tension in their fights? I suspect the producers and screenwriter must have recognized this too, for mid-way thru they turn Jaws into a virtual cartoon character, and ultimately a ""hero"" who helps Bond. (Can anyone remotely picture Odd-job having a change-of-heart in Fort Knox and helping Bond diffuse the bomb???)But what makes ""Moonraker"" truly unbearable is the comic relief. While Fleming purists might not like the witty remarks and tongue-in-cheek humor of the early Bond films, it could be argued that such an approach did make Bond more salable to the movie-going public. I suspect that if Eon Productions had retained the utterly humorless Bond of the novels, then ""Dr. No"" would have been a ""one-off"" production only, instead of the longest-running series in motion picture history. Unfortunately, each movie (especially from ""Diamonds are Forever"" on) became more and more campy and comic. By the time ""Moonraker"" was made Bond was being played strictly for laughs. James Brosnan, author of ""James Bond in the Cinema"", has called ""Moonraker"" the most expensive slapstick movie since ""It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World""...and unfortunately he's right.The gondola sequence in Venice comes off as ridiculous; the craft itself is stupid-looking, and the scene is far too reminiscent of the boat-chases in ""Live and Let Die"" and ""Man w/ the Golden Gun"". But the scene really sinks into the pathetic when the gondola becomes a hovercraft and moves into the piazza. At this point we see tourists staring in disbelief and suspiciously eyeing their drinks, people falling into the water a la the Three Stooges, and even pigeons doing double-takes! (Man, but Ian Fleming must have been doing some serious turns in his grave at this point). Then we're treated to a scene in which Bond gains entrance to a lab by typing on a touch-tone pad, and it's naturally the alien's tune of ""Close Encounters"" (groan). Bond also rides a horse, dressed as a gaucho, to the theme from ""The Magnificent Seven"" (gag).But Jaws contributes the most embarrassing scene in the entire movie (and the entire Bond series) when he meets that little blonde German gal and it's love-at-first-sight. They come together to the strains of ""Tara's Theme"" from ""Gone with the Wind"" and walk off hand-in-hand. OH MY GOD...truly excruciating!!! (By now poor old Ian Fleming must of been spinning like a top). When I first saw this scene in 1979, I was practically grasping for a barf-bag. But I noticed there were plenty of yahoos in the audience who were belly-laughing big-time. Geez, but talk about the producers playing to the lowest common denominator. (And I thought the redneck sheriff of ""Live and Let Die"" and ""Man w/ the Golden Gun"" was as cheesy as it comes!). Jaw-in-Love would be bad enough to sink even a good movie (which ""Moonraker"" certainly is NOT) all by itself. But it's inclusion here insures ""Moonraker"" as the WORST Bond film EVER.",Moonraker
223,andymike-75725,Fun and goofy but unfocused Bond film,6,28 October 2018,Moonraker is by far the goofiest and most unbelievable Bond movie yet. The people who thought that the previous Moore movies was a bit on the goofy side will probably have a hissyfits while watching this one. Their feelings are certainly not unwarranted since the series certainly have changed for better or worse.I am one of those who can find enjoyment in Bond movies no matter where on the goofy spectrum they happen to be. And there is certainly enjoyment to be found in Moonraker.The villain of the story has crafted a space base which he has filled with healthy young specimen of the two genders to repopulate the earth with. With the use of biological weapon he plans to exterminate all human life on earth and it is up to Bond to stop it.The beginning of the story is set in the villains french villa and the end is set in the space station accompanied with silly laser fights. All of this was nice and charming but in the middle Bond seems to travel all across the world to Venice to Rio and so on and i felt that it got a bit too much for my taste.It becomes a bit unfocused and i would much rather that it was set in fewer locations that were more properly explored. Jaws is back yet again and is as charming as ever. I really like the actor behind the role and i enjoy his character however it becomes a bit too goofy sometimes and it is hard to take it seriously when he manages to survive what he does all the time. The joke that he is invincible and can survive everything is taken a bit too far in my opinion.The goofieness can be charming but there was also a charm in the more classy Bond that you could find in the previous movies. The Man with the Golden Gun for instance certainly had some silliness in it but it also had some class to it and that is certainly something that is lacking in this movie.All in all i enjoyed it for what it was however after reading what i have written in this review it seems that even I might have some problem with the goofieness after all. Perhaps it is simply the case that goofiness can be fun and good but a goofy movie will not be as memorable as a classy movie and as Bond movie i would call this a pretty average one.,Moonraker
224,marnixtenbrinke,Bond in space,6,19 November 2008,"Moonraker went over the top, but it's still highly enjoyable.After the success of The Spy Who Loved Me, the producers felt Bond movies could even be more outrageous.The audience loved it and Moonraker became the most successful Bond movie ever, until 1995 when GoldenEye was released.The actors don't have much to do between all the special effects, including James 'Roger Moore' Bond himself.The storyline can't be taken seriously, but it doesn't attempt to be serious.

Sure Moonraker has it's faults but it's got it's upsides like Michael Lonsdale as megalomaniac Hugo Drax obbsessed with being head of a new terrestrial empire, perhaps one feels it was done more to Flemming's specifications the film would not be so highly criticised but one thing we all seem to forget about this is that Moonraker by the end of December 1979 had accumulated  $203,000,000 world-wide in the box office",Moonraker

227,thomas-williamson-ga,Don't Listen To The Critics !!!,9,11 March 2011,"My, how Moonraker has received some unfair reviews. I must have been watching a different movie because I consider this to not only be one of the best 007 films but also the peak of Roger Moore's career as Bond. I suppose I will have to make an attempt to defend the goodness of Moonraker: For one, the plot of this movie at the time was somewhat original and futuristic. Even now, it still stands out to a lesser degree. Second, the gadgets (one weapon in particular) made for a nice little battle at the end of the movie. Third, the Bond girl known as Dr. Goodhead is quite the attractive intellectual who can hold her own despite her cover. Fourth, the main villain while lacking personality is sinister and has some catchy dialog. Fifth, here it comes... the return of JAWS. Yes, the metal mouth giant played by the same actor comes back for his second and unfortunately final outing in the 007 film series. Though JAWS doesn't get quite as much screen time he got in Spy Who Loved Me, his performance suffers no less and still brings much entertainment to the action scenes that he is in. One more thing about JAWS and then I will move on... I really liked how his character turned out near the end of Moonraker. Without giving spoilers, this is one reason I wish JAWS was brought back a third time. The other reason of course being that his character is just so unique to begin with. Seriously, I don't think MGM noticed the potential franchise they could have had with this particular Bond character. To finally move on, the pacing might not have been quite up to par as it was with the Spy Who Loved Me and I think that is one problem critics had with Moonraker. As for me, the pacing didn't ruin a thing and I can't think of any major or central moment as to where the pacing lagged. Another reason critics bashed Moonraker is because of it's ""over the top futuristic plot theme"". I beg to differ; this is part of what made Moonraker stand out from the typical and occasionally overused 007 formula. Trust me folks, Moonraker holds up there with its predecessor that critics so dearly praised though rightfully so and as I commented at the start; this may have been a peak in the 007 series especially considering a few of the future Bond films that came after it.",Moonraker
228,rharvey-74630,Bond in space! (It's as bad as it sounds!),5,16 May 2019,"Oh my; the producers turn the campiness meter up to 11 on this one. Next to Die Another Day, it's the most ludicrous Bond film. I can understand why it happened: Star Wars created the potential for blockbuster space films; and one of habits of the Bond franchise is to up the ante on prior films. This film is basically a remake of its predecessor The Spy Who Loved Me, only involving a trip to outer space via a space shuttle. The villain even has his own Death Star. Wow. Added to this outlandishness, is a far too campy return of the Jaws character. The Bond Girl, a CIA agent is at least Bond's equal, although a bit bland. A highlight for me is the villain, Hugo Drax, whose given some great lines. Michael Lonsdale gives a great performance. The film is entertaining, but just so over the top. It at least prompted the producers to aim for a down to earth grittier film for the next one.",Moonraker

Now, I was never crazy about Roger Moore to begin with but it wasn't just his performance that makes this one of my least favorite Bond films. The plot is weak and it seems like the main drive behind this film was to earn popularity (and money) in the same way Star Wars: A New Hope had done just two years earlier. The attempts at action are laughable and often times portray way more violence than is necessary. Granted the usual dry humor can be found through Bond's comments and ""social"" situations (which is why I gave it some credit) but everything just seems forced. It's almost like the producers felt obligated to make Moonraker to appease the fans who didn't want to wait a few extra years for them to come up with a good script. In my opinion they'd have done the fans a huge favor by forgoing this mistake.",Moonraker

Well Bond having chased bad guys all over the Earth needed a new challenge perhaps so now we takes his adventures into outer space.Maybe the reason this Bond film just isn't quite like the others is because its trying I'm my opinion to follow some of the Science Fiction films that we around at the time an not so much the traditional Bond theme.

233,stephengward,James Bond in space!!??,1,18 March 2000,"Where do I start? Well, Roger Moore's fourth 007 epic is indeed a poor affair to say the least. After the success of previous Bond movie 'The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)' the Bond franchisers lose the plot completely with this entry in the long-running series. I'm a die hard Bond fan, I love the films and find it difficult to find fault in them. However, whilst the film has certain redeeming features, in general this is bad!!  Moonraker contains the lowest point in which the 007 movies have sunk too - steel toothed villain Jaws falling in love!!  Its all too formulaic and is no more than Bond by the numbers. Released in 1979 and the first not to be made at Pinewood studios in England, it cashed in on the space craze which hit the silver screen at the end of the seventies (predominately due to the success of Star Wars). At the time the most expensive Bond film ever made, its not difficult to see that the majority of the alloted budget went to special effects rather than to that of the script! The character of 007 has never been so diminished then it is here in this movie. Bond is now merely a tool that demonstrates gadgets and not quick wits. The film can be entertaining if you can over look previous great 007 films such as 'From Russia With Love' and 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. For its when you compare this offering to those movies you realise how far off the rails the series has gone. Shirley Bassey provides the theme song for the third and final time, its nice enough but not particularly memorable. Bernard Lee makes his final appearance as 'M'.  If you're a 12 year-old and you like mindless sci-fi movies that require little attention span, then this is the Bond for you! Sorry to stereotype, but in actual fact most people I've chatted with who like this movie fall into this category. Bond films always provide a sense of deja vu. That's fine by me, its part of the charm of the series, in essence all (bar one or two) follow the same winning story line and it works well. Moonraker stretches credibility way too far without success. Thankfully producer Albert R. Broccoli took heed of this and returned the good commander to earth in 'For Your Eyes Only (1981).",Moonraker
234,sqdb,Roger Moore's Worst Bond Film,3,16 September 2016,"This film was originally released in 1979 and was Roger Moore's fourth Bond film.I cannot think of words appropriate enough to describe this abomination to cinema. I have always regarded Moonraker as Moore's worst Bond film and one of the worst and certainly one of the silliest Bond films in total. This film was a blatant cash-in on the success of Star Wars in 1977 and shares that film's problem of being all spectacle and virtually no plot.There are very few positive things that I can say about Moonraker. It features a lot of references, both visual and audio, to other, more superior films. All of these nods are cringe-worthy and do not work in the context of a Bond film. The special effects now look very dated, there is no decent eye candy and the film seems to go on for much longer than its 2 hour running time. Bond films are usually renowned for their spectacular stunts and action scenes, but even those seem lame in this film. I found the pre-credits skydiving scene enjoyable, though even that was ruined by the very noticeable and obvious stunt doubles. I also quite enjoyed the cable car fight but hated the action scenes that were set in space towards the end of the film. These outer space scenes were a step too far in my opinion, even by the Roger Moore standards.So, to sum up, this really was one of the worst ever Bond films and still is to this day. Roger Moore really phoned in his performance in this film. It is easily the weakest of the Lewis Gilbert Bond films, in my opinion. Thank God that For Your Eyes Only followed this, to bring back the decent Bond films and make them more grounded again. They certainly couldn't get much worse than this...I simply cannot recommend this film to anyone, other than dedicated Roger Moore fans or Bond completists. It will pass a couple of hours quite nicely, though, as long as you switch your brain off and don't think about the plot too much. I hate to be unkind to a Bond film, but I just cannot defend Moonraker at all. Thank God for the 80s Bonds...",Moonraker
235,spankymac,The first Bond movie I saw in a theater...,7,21 May 2004,"I've always appreciated Roger Moore's dashing portrayal of Bond, even thought he didn't have the authority of Connery. This particular story is a favorite, combining all the features I've come to expect from 007--goofy gags, wonderful gadgets, along with a bit of action and suspense. Only ten years after Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, the space scenes are period-accurate, though not altogether realistic. It's a romp through old technology...and one more reason that the list of things evil megalomaniacs should avoid grew as long as it did. I enjoyed the return of Richard Kiel as Jaws...hardly makes a sound, but makes his presence known nonetheless. The no-gravity scene at the space station near the end is a little cheesy, with ""space marines"" going after the bad guys with weapons we haven't seen even twenty-five years later.It's a James Bond movie, for crying out loud...not the best one, but I think one of the good ones.",Moonraker

In this film, the central villain is Hugo Draxx; a billionaire whose works is in space exploration and plotting to poison all of the Earth except for those he deems worthy of living. Sounds like a cliché for Bond to me. The haphazard attempt a decent plot sets this film off on the wrong foot and it goes down hill from there.To me, the greatest problem with this film is the poorly incorporated camp. The humor does not fit with the action. For instance, when James Bond is riding the Gondola through Venice, viewers are supposed to laugh at the absurdity of that while he acts all casual and all the citizens noticing it are stunned. They're not running from a huge Kyac; they're staring in shock. The sex scene with Bond and his chic for this film when they lose gravity truly sets the tone for how dull this film's humor attempts are.Why Ian?

238,ThomasHayden,Not all that bad...,6,3 March 2005,"Considered almost unanimously as one of the worst films in James Bond series, it is time for Moonraker to have a defender. On my opinion, this is Moore's best fourth outing as 007(may be not saying too much, but there are three films left), and a very entertaining sci-fi film. Critics argue that humor plays a strong hand in this movie-strong to such a degree that Bond character loses all personality, becoming blurred in an impressive set of FX and stunt men. I reply: certainly there are flaws, some of them (particularly Jaws conversion towards the end) very ridiculous. But there are good points, too. Remember that pre-credit scene, which was ACTUALLY shot in the air, the motorboat chase or the final space battle, one of the most spectacular moments of the entire series, (yeah, it was unrealistic, OK, but tell me how much realism you can find watching other Bond movies which are frequently referred to as"" the best"". Think of Goldfinger or You only live twice)However, Moonraker does not compare to Octopussy or TSWLM, because of a sometimes plodding pacing, due to the addition of unnecessary scenes, especially during the first half, when James is Drax's guest in California. The love story is a mere and inferior copy of TSWLM. And, while in other Moore's films the blend of humor and Bond's trademark coolness worked smoothly, here Bond is not given a scene to show, not necessarily ruthlessness, but a bit of harshness, as we could see in FYEO or Octopussy.Following Moore's outings will feature Cold War elements which seem to fit more with the character, and better screenplays from Richard Maibaum,the series' screenwriter who was mysteriously absent here.But action remains mostly exciting, sometimes brilliant, and highlights what could have been a mediocre entry.",Moonraker

Nothing in the plot makes any sense (I mean, why would Drax try to kill Bond right after meeting him? that makes it pretty obvious he's behind the missing shuttle--and that's just the start of the idiocy).May be the worst Bond girl ever--we just came off Britt Ekland and Barbara Bach, who each know how to show off their bodies, and here Lois Chiles just wears these blah dresses. And if she ever talked in anything other than a monotone, I missed it (maybe she was really a robot, like in Westworld or something). And what about that first girl, Corrin Dufour--was she made out of plastic--don't they have hair brushes available when they film these scenes?The movie was clearly played for just action and humor, and neither are pulled off--Austin Powers showed us how that could be done.Jaws softening up was dumb, plot holes are egregious, dialog was terrible. Villain Drax was good, but who cared with the rest of the movie. Even the song was bad.I am shocked to see this did so well at the box office.I did give it one point for Q's final line in the movie--that was excellent.",Moonraker
242,m-atanasoff,Did someone order the fondue?,7,30 July 2019,"As someone who was born in the Pierce Brosnan era of Bond and having seen only the Sean Connery and later Daniel Craig iterations, and having no specific warmth towards the franchise, I must admit I probably won't give the most objective opinion possible. That being said, I had a great time watching Moonraker. It was spectacularly cheesy, making me laugh with absolute sincerity on many occasions from the very introductory scene, where two randos simply jack a shuttle being carried on top of an airplane. And that's not even the tip of the iceberg when it comes to ridiculousness. Several times I had to remind myself I am not watching an episode of Archer, but it's hardly surprising, since the latter has always drawn inspiration from the pulpy side of spy fiction. I just had no idea until now, how pulpy it can get!
I just have one question. Does Dr. Goodhead, give good...you know.",Moonraker
243,SomebodyToListenTo,A Very Good Movie - Highly Underrated,9,19 December 1999,"It was with good reason that Broccoli and Co. decided to release this one before For Your Eyes Only.  Moonraker was more in line with The Spy Who Loved Me and it offered a returning role for Jaws.While a lot of IMDB users may say this movie is over-the-top garbage, it is not.  All the most successful Bond films starting with Goldfinger, have been over the top.  Moonraker is no exception.A lot of the effects are dated, which is why I think most people trash this movie, but this movie still retains its appeal.  The space battle may look weak from an effects standpoint but that action is vintage Bond straight out of Thunderball.Drax is by no means the best villain of 007 but he is more believable than many throughout the series (See Savalis as Blofeld in OHMSS as a bad example).  He is clever, cunning and creative in his use of methods for trying to kill Bond.  And how he kills Corrine Clery, it is every trespasser's nightmare.  Drax definitely sent chills down my spine.
Jaw's return is great but this role tends to be a subject of great controversy.  How can a really bad guy in one film become a good guy in another?  I think so, it is possible.  Women make men do strange things. Controversies aside, Jaws picks up where he left off in The Spy Who Loved Me, and continues his larger-than-live role.Many people fault the story and say it is not believable.  I have never expected a Bond movie to be believable.  Others say the script has holes. I agree that there are some scenes that have too much screen time but what keeps this movie together is a consistent storyline that keeps Bond trotting around the globe.The locales are definitely where this movie excels over other Bond movies. Rio, Venice, and few other places I can't recall. These are what make this movie great.  It offered great opportunity for Bond to investage Drax and maintain our interest at the same time.  As well, Bond's encounter with Jaws on the cable car was a real nail biter the first time I saw it.
The women in this movie are great.  Lois Chiles was perfectly cast.  She was serious enough to pass as a CIA agent and sexy enough for Bond.  Clery was a great as an executive assistant.  It was unfortunate how she was eventually disposed of by Drax.The music in the movie is retro since it is scored by John Barry.  And since this movie succeeded The Spy Who Loved Me, everyone was expecting another ""Nobody Does It Better.""  The Moonraker theme is up there with Goldfinger due to the fact Shirley Bassy's voice has aged quite well.  It is unfortunate that this song didn't fair as well chart-wise as Carly Simon's song.  The melody is more complex and suits Moonraker better than Simon's song suited The Spy Who Loved Me.  I guess history will decide.No wonder this movie did so well at the box office; it is pure eye-candy. The outer space theme coupled with good villains, great women and many exotic locales.  This one gets a 9/10 in my book.  A very good movie that is highly underrated.",Moonraker

245,helenaharrison,007 in space.......,7,14 July 2001,"Roger Moore's 4th 007 film, 'Moonraker' promises everything, literally, but leaves you with the feeling that you're missing something familiar..... First of all, Roger looked very comfortable in the role, and charmed his way around every scene, but what's new? Anyway, bond girl 'Holly Goodhead' (Lois Chiles) delivers a stern performance as a strong willed woman, who tries to match 007 in every way! The plot includes billionaire space designer 'Hugo Drax' (Michael Lonsdale) attempting to create a space station in space, literally, and agent 007 trying to find the missing Moonraker shuttle, which was stolen in mid-air. The scenery is very nice with France, Venice and Guatemala providing key location spots. Bernard Lee is present, in his last 007 film, and so too is 'Jaws' (Richard kiel) who stars as Drax's bodyguard, and the scenes between him and 007 provide the amusement. The theme tune performed by Shirley Bassey is very haunting and very under-rated, under the talents of John Barry and Hal David. Overall, a fun film, which has many flaws, but hugely enjoyable nevertheless. A film I recommend is 'The Spy Who Loved Me'(1977), the previous 007 film before this, yet far superior in plot, performances and action, and a brilliant theme tune performed by Carly Simon.",Moonraker
246,robertlloyd777,Less impressive bond,5,3 February 2003,"When seeing Bond films, I judge it on the usual features (Villain, score, and Bond girl) and content. Here is what I thoughtVillain- I can't help but notice that Drax had quite a few similarities with Stromberg in SWLM. They were both incredibly wealthy, they liked beautiful women, and Drax had the same passion for space that Stromberg had for the ocean. They were also perhaps the dullest villains Bond ever faced. Drax was a good megalomaniac, but he just wasn't as intriguing as Dr. No or Blofeld. Jaws came back, but I thought that he was just a big joke this time. in SWLM, it was bad enough, but I think that this time, he was just one big joke.Bond Girl- I didn't really think that Lois Chiles was a good idea for a bond girl. especially when you compared her with Barbara Bach in the previous film. My problem with her was that she just lacked charisma, and didn't convey fear or emotion very well.Score- Shirley Bassey and bond definitely go well with each other. the moonraker song was not as intense as DAF or GF, but I still thought it was a great score.What I liked about MR  ****WARNING, YOU MAY FIND SPOILERS****1. There was a good story hidden behind all those gags, and there were some cool scenes. My favorite was the battle in the Venetian glass between bond and chang.2. Bernard Lee's last performance, and, call me crazy, but probably one of his best. He proved to be Bond's friend in this movie instead of his cranky boss. He was probably the best M there was.What I didn't like about MR1. In this movie, as well as MWTGG, you will see the worst of Roger Moore's ridiculous gags and humor which does not belong in a bond film. Roger was a good bond at times, but when you watch this, you'll sometimes wonder how he replaced Connery.2. Way too Sci-fi. Yes Star Wars was out, and it could have meant big bucks for Cubby Broccoli (which it did, one of the highest grossing bonds of all time) but it just is not bond to be on spaceships shooting laser guns. If you watch the next bond FYEO it is interesting to see the difference.",Moonraker
247,nkingstown3,Entertaining,7,9 August 2005,"I may have the minority opinion, but Roger Moore is w/o a doubt my favorite 007. He has true charm, is extremely handsome, and is unintentionally funny. His facial expressions are also quite priceless. This movie is probably the most criticised of any in the series, but certainly has its merits. It's a sleeper and is a bit hokey, but has real entertainment value. The villain is Drax, a worthy nemesis. Suave and sophisticated, wealthy, sarcastic, and supremely pompous, he exemplifies what a 007 foe should be. Dr. Holly Goodhead (oh so subtle) is Moore's primary love interest, and is embodied by the stunning Lois Chiles. Although all installments are quite incredible, this one perhaps pushes the envelope a bit too far. Still, aside from this most obvious and other flaws, this is a very enjoyable (and quite funny) film. The highlight of the movie is the soundtrack. ""Moonraker"" sung by Shirley Bassey is a gorgeous song, and sets the tone nicely. At any rate, worth watching.",Moonraker

249,David007,James Bond perfectly at home in outer space!,9,11 September 1998,"Usually considered as a low point in the series of Bond movies, MOONRAKER is to me one of the best. There are a few minor flaws but on the whole MOONRAKER is tremendously  beautiful (I easily give it a 9 out of 10 ).Many people have compared MOONRAKER with Star Wars, but both movies have almost nothing in common. Almost everything in MOONRAKER was designed to create realism and believability, especially the wonderful special effects in space. Of course, the bigger-than-life dimension is present, as in every Bond movie, making MOONRAKER an excellent experience.As usual Roger Moore is an excellent James Bond, surrounded by a very fine cast, among which the icy-cold Michael Lonsdale and two beautiful ladies, Corinne Cléry and Lois Chiles. Lewis Gilbert's direction is nice, the production design by Ken Adam is very impressive and John Barry's music is exquisite.There are lots of breathtaking scenes in Moonraker: the precredits sequence, the death of Corinne, the boat chase in Venice, the fight with Chang, the second boat chase, and most of the final space sequence.About flaws: a little too much humour at times, maybe a little too much technology; the space battle in the end looks artificial and the destruction of the spheres looks like a video game...The space theme had been introduced and developed very early in Bond movies (Dr. No, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever) and it thus appears logical that one day Bond would have to go to space himself; and there he seems perfectly at home!",Moonraker
250,Avatar-29,"Why, God, why?",1,22 July 1999,"Why did anyone involved with this wonderful franchise allow this trite to be filmed?  Why couldn't someone with a conscience have burned the final print before it was released?  Why did they allow Roger Moore to continue playing Bond when he was over 50??If you haven't gotten the picture yet, this is, by far, the absolute worst of the series.  There are a few decent scenes, but, let's face it, the whole space station battle thing was idiotic.  Then, there's Jaws.  He went from a terrifying villain to a comedic sidekick.  The acting is horrendous on all fronts, the story is horrible (read the book by Fleming, which has a much more insidious, believable plot), and, unfortunately, it's the last one Bernard Lee (M) is in.

It's the only one that really took a few steps into science fiction territory, and Richard Kiel as Jaws does an excellent job. Even though I don't feel this is Roger Moore's best movie as Bond (my vote goes to A View to a Kill), he does good nonetheless.As a side note, the laser guns used by the Marines in the film's denouement were later featured in the Goldeneye video game. I remember them there for being fast, powerful, and with unlimited ammo.Well, this movie has girls, gadgets, and guns; what else could you ask for in a 007 film? Watch it.",Moonraker
252,sean-devitt,Highly enjoyable entertainment,7,5 December 2012,"Moonraker is the movie critics like to attack. I am not going to disagree with them about the ludicrous plot and the descent into childishness.To me it's obvious that Moonraker has just one purpose. To entertain its audience and give them a memorable spectacle. This movie delivers that.There are many silly things in Moonraker but it knows it. Some of the scenes are too silly but after the appalling slide whistle sound that almost ruined a wonderful car stunt in 'The Man With the Golden Gun' I think we grew accustomed to Roger Moore movies being taken as a joke.Even the 'serious one' For Your Eyes Only had a Margaret Thatcher impersonator talking to a parrot and Blofeld being dropped down a chimney stack.Roger Moore and Michel Lonsdale are great in Moonraker. Drax saying to Bond ""Can I press you to a cucumber sandwich"" is worth the budget alone.Moonraker was the movie I wanted to see as a child but was never taken. Instead I was taken to see For Your Eyes Only. If I were a movie critic I would have been pleased but as a kid excited by the previous 2 Bond movies I was disappointed. I wanted an epic story with a big battle at the end. Moonraker did that.The sets and special effects were amazing, Jaws got a girlfriend, the final line by Q remains the funniest line ever uttered in a Bond Movie and above all it's memorable.To say it jumped the shark misses the point in my opinion. It was supposed to. Every scene in the movie was played to the max with the intention of entertainment. Not all of it works of course but at least you could see they were trying.Also I don't see how Moonraker is all that more ludicrous than You Only Live Twice (Connery trying to look Japanese!), Goldfinger or 3 out of 4 of the Brosnan movies.Die Another Day is jumping the shark. Windsurfing a Tsunami, a Korean guy turning into a billionaire white Englishman being knighted by the Queen in 14 months, invisible car and Halle Berry trying to act! Roger Moore in a Space Shuttle looked like a trip to Walmart in comparison.",Moonraker
253,cen19,An under-appreciated contribution to the Bond franchise,9,3 January 2006,"Many people have written about this being the weakest of the Bond movies, but I must respectfully disagree. Yes, it latched on to the ""Star Wars"" fascination by being an outer space adventure, but it certainly stands on it's own merits. The special effects are terrific, but this is not just a special effects movie.Bond's nemesis in the film, Hugo Drax, is a wonderfully overconfident, determined, bad guy in the truest sense of the word. The main ""Bond Girl"" in the film, Lois Chiles as Dr. Goodhead is by far the most capable Bond girl, up until Halle Barre in ""Die Another Day"". She is a CIA operative, immune to Bond's charms for most of the movie, and not only able to pilot a space shuttle, but also able to take out two of Drax's henchmen on her own without any help from James.This locales used to film this movie were appropriate for the story line, but they were all equally exciting.. from space shuttle centrifuges in California, to ancient ruins in the Amazon. No wonder it is one of the highest grossing Bond films ever.",Moonraker
254,mifsudm-75748,FULL BREAKDOWN,6,12 February 2019,"BREAKDOWN:Writing (Christopher Wood): I don't even know where to begin with the writing of this film. Either 'Moonraker' is a hilariously bad film or it is the most self-aware James Bond movie that embraces the ridiculousness. I will assume the latter just based on how ridiculous it gets in some points. Fights just happen out of nowhere for no reason and some happen in ridiculous ways, such as the coffin knife-thrower or the glass museum samurai. Jaws also appears out of nowhere in each fight and is hilariously defeated each time. My favorite part of the script is that although James Bond does not change as a character, Jaws changes significantly and so does Bond's relationship with Jaws. Overall, this script is great if it is thought of like a James Bond parody. My only complaint is that the story does not start to develop large stakes until Bond and Goodhead are on the space station and Drax's plan really starts to become the primary subject in the story. But from that point on, it's actually very thrilling. Also, the movie introduces so many characters that we only hear from once and never again or just have no significance to the story overall. 7/10Performances: Roger Moore does a great job as Bond and really brings the hilarious personality to life with his delivery of quips during inappropriate times. The supporting cast, however, is nothing special with exception of Lois Chiles as Goodhead and Richard Kiel as Jaws. 5/10Cinematography (Jean Tournier): The cinematography is actually fantastic in this flick and one of the more impressive parts. The shots of the space station really come to mind and the scene where the dogs are running after the woman is also well-shot. 8/10Editing (John Glen): The editing of this film is iffy. There are some scenes where the amount of cuts is clearly to make up for lack of choreography. In addition, most fight scenes have no music to them and seem incredibly awkward most especially the glass museum samurai fight. 4/10Visual Effects: The VFX in this film are actually very impressive for the most part. The space station looks very cool and the space battle was fun to look at. The only effect I thought needed a lot of work was the space station falling apart. It was clear that PAs were just on the side of the walls pushing them in. 7/10Enjoyment: Moonraker is an incredibly enjoyable movie that is best watched with friends at a movie night. It's hilarious and action-packed and will bring a good time, especially with some drinks in hand. 9/10Musical Score (John Barry): The music is just classic James Bond with some calmer tracks thrown in for the space scenes. There isn't much to analyze here because of how little the score was used. 5/10Sound Mixing (Daniel Brisseau): The sound in this movie is pretty good. There was definitely an overuse of the bullet whoosh sound effects for when bullets fly past bond, but it's decent for the late 70s. It also helps that the film was kind of reliant on the sound design for fights because of the lack of music. 8/10Production Design (Ken Adam): The production design is beautiful in 'Moonraker,' albeit underused. Some sets are absolutely stunning, but they serve no significance to the plot and we only see them for 2 minutes, but that isn't the fault of the production designer. The best use of production design is the space station by far. 8/10Overall: 'Moonraker' is a hilariously good time that makes you laugh at James Bond movies as a whole. Unfortunately, if you were expecting to find another Skyfall, you're not gonna find it here due to awkward fight scenes and useless characters and moments. 6/10",Moonraker
255,JGnino,John-597 is absolutely correct- Moonraker is one of the best!,9,19 October 2000,"John-597 is absolutely correct!Moonraker is one of the most enjoyable Bond films for its complete package of excellent stunts, special effects, gadgets, beautiful women, and Globe-trotting plot.  We even have closure for Jaws! Given that nearly ALL Bond films are (just a bit) far fetched, this one at least gives a rather unique plot with a double dose of technology and eye-candy!",Moonraker
256,john-597,A brilliant Bond film that is highly underrated!,10,8 March 2000,"""Moonraker"" is the most unfairly criticised of all the Bond films. The 11th film in the series and the fourth starring Roger Moore, ""Moonraker"" works very well for a number of reasons. As Ian Fleming's original novel (written in 1955) had become too dated to translate to the screen, the producers decided to capitalise on the sci-fi craze started by Star Wars, and so created a spectacular space-age adventure where Bond himself journeys into outer space.Whilst this film was certainly inspired by Star Wars, this is not meant to imply that ""Moonraker"" copies directly from the former. Don't forget that only the last 20-30 minutes of the film takes place in space. Although the laser battle looks dated by modern standards, it is still a classic slice of Bond action, that, as one reviewer has stated, compares with the underwater battle in ""Thunderball"". And on that level it works superbly. What I especially like about ""Moonraker"" is the way it glides smoothly from one action sequence to another. This way, there's not only no shortage of thrills, but an overall level of consistency in the storyline is maintained, where Bond hops across the globe (to Venice and Rio, for example) uncovering clues as to the disappearance of the Moonraker space shuttle. On the way, he survives the customary assassination attempts by the bad guys (Drax and Jaws), and then at the end of the film all the clues piece together to complete the jigsaw. It's steady, consistent storylines like this that prove the key to a successful Bond film.Purists often accuse ""Moonraker"" of being too stupid. Although there are some pretty outrageous sight gags, the film still retains its enormous appeal. Certainly, ""Moonraker"" is the most light-hearted Bond film, and it's quite clear that Roger Moore was enjoying himself tremendously here. His performance in this escapade certainly brought a smile to my lips.There's also a wonderful cast. Drax is quite possibly the best Bond villain. His one-liners are great and he is certainly not short of ideas on how to dispose of Bond. The beautiful Lois Chiles proves to have the right qualities as an astronaut/CIA agent, and she is a worthy ally to 007. Bond's first romantic encounter Corinne Dufour (Corinne Clery) brings a lot to the film.  Richard Kiel makes his encore performance as the steel-toothed giant Jaws. After his superhuman appearance in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", Jaws plays more for laughs this time round, but his Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote-type battles with 007 are still entertaining. There's also another henchman, Chang (Toshiro Suga) who provides more credibility if somewhat less invincibility in a superbly staged duel with Bond in a glass factory.""Moonraker"" also sees John Barry at his composing best. He provides a number of rich, atmospheric tracks that perfectly reflect the film's outer space theme. Shirley Bassey's third title song isn't quite as good as ""Goldfinger"" but better than ""Diamonds Are Forever"", and is certainly as good as Carly Simon's song for TSWLM.""Moonraker"" has often been placed at the bottom of the Bond spectrum. It doesn't belong there. It has everything a successful Bond film needs: a great plot, superb villains, exotic locations, beautiful women, brilliant special effects (for which visual effects maestro Derek meddings received an Oscar nomination) and action by the bucketful. There are scenes which generate genuine suspense and which feature awe-inspiring stunts in mid-air and on water. The space scenes are well done and all aspects of the space shuttle look true to life. In summary, ""Moonraker"" is a brilliant film in its own right and should rank up there with ""Goldfinger"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" as one of the best Bonds ever made. I strongly urge you doubters to take a second look.",Moonraker

I don't know why I wasn't that excited about the special boat chase scene, it just seemed rushed, as though nothing was really happening. Then he got caught by the enemy and it dos en't feel like bond anymore. I thought the space effects would not be to bad, as star wars was released two years earlier. I was wrong they were crap.

How can you go wrong?! To review this movie, let us consider each of the characters.James Bond (Roger Moore): James Bond is a beast in this movie. I mean, he beats the ninja's ass, he bangs two babes (one while in space), and he saves the world from an evil Nazi from space. What more could he possibly do? Hugo Drax: He has always been my favorite Bond villain (of course it helps we have the same first name). I mean, to begin with, he is a PIMP. Look at all those girls around him, it is like damn Drax you are fly. He lives in space. He shoots lasers. He wants to take over the world. He likes pressing people to cucumber sandwiches. He feeds his exes to dogs. This man is the coolest dude to ever grace the silver screen.Jaws: He is my favorite henchman in a Bond film (ever since I reached the Aztec Comples in Goldeneye). I mean, come on, he has freaking metal teeth and is like 8 feet tall. Plus he gets a woman, although I always thought he could do better than Dolly. I love him here. I love him in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (movie and book where he's 'The Horror'). I love him in ""Goldeneye"" and ""Everything or Nothing"", too. Here's hoping he's back for Bond 22.The Girls: I have always thought Bond is at his best when he's with a Russian chick (besides Natalya who Goldeneye 64 convinced me to hate with a passion). Obviously here he isn't but oh well. The girls pass.The Song: The main song of this movie is freaking sweet. I have the Best of Bond CD and love blasting it through the streets.Overall: ""Moonraker"" is awesome. I recommend it to guys who like movies (especially movies with lasers and spacemen).",Moonraker

I'm old enough to remember seeing this when it first came out and my 12 year old self thoroughly enjoyed it and watching it again 34 years later it is still fun. It is rightly criticised for the silly gags and they are certainly annoying, the idea that a secret laboratory manufacturing a deadly nerve gas would use the theme from Close Encounters as the code to the door is so fatuous that it robs the film of credibility. It is also hard for a modern audience to watch the scenes from Drax's base without being reminded of Dr Evil's lair from the Austin Powers films.

The eleventh Bond film was changed from the scheduled For Your Eyes Only to tie in with the phenomenal success of George Lucas's action packed Sci-fi. But if that Galaxy was further away, the film version of Flemings third Bond novel could have been very different and in my opinion would have been better if the original story was followed. The film itself is a good entry with Ken Adams sets being the best feature. His design for the space station is incredible and must be one of the best film sets ever created.

Or that just let me know how other people feel about movies I enjoy (or dislike) I have decided to write my own series of reviews, in hope that my unique outlook will help others. Being a huge 007 fan since 4 or 5 years old, having seen them all many, many times, and having a wealth of useless 007 knowledge outside of venues such as this, I have decided to review all of the Bond films in order of my least favorite to my #1 favorite. Let me start by saying that there is no bad Bond film to me. That is one of the things that divide the Bond films from so many other series of films and their pointless sequels that continue to get worse and worse. I begin with Moonraker, a good film that I like, but my least favorite of the 007 films. Like any movie there will be people who think it's the greatest/worst film ever. But I hope to bring an honest aspect to my review. I don't like to just trash films, yet I don't overly praise much either. My view is that every film no matter how bad, has a least one good thing about it. Even if it's just a funny line, cool camera angle or a hot chick. There is that satisfaction of at least being able to say ""I've seen it for myself"". I've seen Moonraker many times, and without a doubt it does contain one of the most exciting opening procured scenes of them all. A mid-air free fall battle for who gets the parachute. No CGI back in those days, the stunt men had to make dozens of jumps if not more to film the scene. The villain with the steel teeth ""Jaws"" returns. There is a great fight in the 1st half where more glass is broken in any fist fight I can remember at the moment. And the special effects are great, if dated, they still look really good. The kind of effects that in a way look more real than a lot of recent stuff. But there are some draw backs. Being that Roger Moore was about 50 during the previous film ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", his age was starting to show during this one. Remember Connery is a few years younger than Moore in real life, and had done six 007 films before Moores first. So yes I like Moore but he stayed to long. This is only a minor however. The real issue is the silliness factor. The story is pretty out there, and then throw in a bit to much slapstick and it begins to strain credibility. The Bond girl ""Dr. Goodhead"" is beautiful, but kind of bland. The villain Drax is good, but nothing exceptional. But all of this type stuff is forgivable as in many of the other 007 movies. The real problem is that it was made because Star Wars was a hit, so.....lets postpone For Your Eyes Only and send Bond to space! Granted the film made a lot of money, it broke the formula a bit too much in a bad way. There were to many slow spots through the middle of the movie. A cable car sequence has a cool start with a ridiculous finish. And even the big space laser battle finale seems slow. Jaws becomes a good guy at the very end, along with his pigtailed girlfriend now? I was looking forward to a big final showdown between Bond and Jaws to see how Jaws would finally die and that moment never comes. It defiantly stands apart from the others as does Brosnans Die Another Day, his fourth outing as well. It is worth seeing if your a Bond/Moore/sci-fi fan. But if your introducing a friend to 007 flicks, don't start with this one. Every Bond film is good. And on a 1-10 scale of just the 007 films I give it a 4. Lookout for my next Bond review.........The Man with the Golden Gun.",Moonraker
266,Peechy,'Moonraker AKA Bond In Space!' or 'James Bond Jumps the Shark',1,14 October 2012,"Being a Bond fan, I avoided this monstrosity for decades. When I finally gained the courage to watch I was awestruck. The plot is stodgy and in places hard to follow. It is littered with film references (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Young Frankenstein to name but two), product placement and jokes at the franchise it's self. There are more Bond references in this Bond film than the fantastic French spy spoof OSS:117. Worst of all is the films treatment of Jaws. The terrifyingly resilient adversary from the previous film is reduced to stumbling fool for Bond's comic foil, falling both in love and, impossibly, to earth in a shard of broken space station. If you add to this a dirgey script, unfeasible space scenes and poor acting by all but Michael Lonsdale, it is easy to see why this is considered the poorest of the Bond films. Ultimately, James Bond is a spy series, not Sci-Fi.I can only assume that the director , Lewis Gilbert, had grown tired of this series 12 years after his last involvement and was unsurprised to learn that the writer was also responsible for the 'Confessions of...' series. This is a demonstration of lazy studio's using a popular franchise to put any old nonsense on screen knowing it will gross. The film has more comedy than the afore mentioned OSS:117 though is immeasurably less entertaining. If you are looking for comedy Bond I'd recommend the two perfectly pitched films from the French OSS:117 series, the classic 1967 Casino Royale or even the Austen Powers cannon. Other than that stick to the 'serious' Bonds and leave Moonraker to those with an over inflated sense of irony.",Moonraker

269,starfox-4,goodbye Mr bond!!!!!!!,9,28 April 2006,"""Moonraker"" by ludo.t (starfox-4)Following the humongous financial success of the original Star Wars movie in 1977 and of the tenth Bond movie (The Spy Who Loved Me, 1977), producer Cubby Broccoli and returning director Lewis Gilbert could only see one way to continue the Bond saga in order to ensure larger revenue for the eleventh Bond outing: By sending James Bond in outer space! Clearly listening to their fans who loved gigantic henchman Jaws from the previous movie, Gilbert and script writer Christopher Wood had to bring back the popular character. However, Wood basically ignored everything from Ian Fleming's third novel written in 1955. Moonraker is the story of how megalomaniac Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale) plans to create a master race of superior human specimens in outer space on his space station while wiping out the entire world population using a toxic nerve gas. Drax then plans for future generations to return to Earth and re-populate it, as his toxin would not have armed any animal or plant. With Moonraker, James Bond became science fiction, to many people's chagrin. Fortunately, Bond would return to the spy thriller genre for the next film (For Your Eyes Only, 1981). Many fans feel that Moonraker went too far! Others feel that original story from the Fleming novel is far superior and more interesting than the unbelievable storyline in outer space. Does James Bond belong in a laser gun fight? Nevertheless, Roger Moore's fourth outing as James Bond is certainly one of his funniest, with a script packed with humour and play on words. The first half of the movie is very similar to any typical Bond adventure. Bond has to travel to Hugo Drax's residence to investigate the disappearance of a Moonraker shuttle. Bond seduces Drax assistant Corine DuFour (Corrine Clery), and goes through Drax's safe, finding blueprints for glassware made by Venini Glass. Escaping from two attempts on his life, Bond leaves Drax and henchman Chang (Toshiro Suga) for Venice, where he follows Drax employee Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) to Venini Glass. Bond later finds a secret laboratory where the glassware is being used to store a deadly chemical. Bond attempts to inform M, but Drax manages to move his laboratory before Bond can show any incriminating evidence to his superior. Bond is now left with two clues: a packaging slip from C&W, and a phial containing the deadly chemical. Teaming up with Holly Goodhead who reveals herself as a CIA agent, Bond travels to Rio DE Janeiro where he finds an empty C&W warehouse. Q informs Bond that the chemical is a black orchid from the upper reaches of the Amazon. Bond makes his way to a hidden base in the Amazon, where Drax is launching various Moonraker shuttles in space. Up to this point, the storyline makes perfect sense, as Bond finds clues which leads him to different locations. He also uncovers that Holly Goodhead is a CIA agent, and finally ends in a typical situation: having to save the world from a villain wanting its destruction. For the second time, Bond finds his way into an astronaut uniform, but this time, he does travel to space (as opposed to You Only Live Twice in 1965 where 007 is identified as an intruder and removed from the shuttle). If viewers can accept the unbelievable storyline in the last quarter of the movie, that their favourite spy finds his way in a Moonraker shuttle, having to team up with Jaws to battle Drax's army in a laser gun fight and having to destroy globes carrying the deadly chemical before they reach the Earth's atmosphere, the movie can be quite enjoyable. Learning from past mistakes, such as casting a dreadful actress for an important role (such as the awful Barbara Bach as secret agent Triple X in The Spy Who Loved Me), Gilbert and Broccoli chose an actress who could be believable as a CIA agent in Lois Chiles. Not being the most beautiful or talented actress, Chiles still delivered a convincing performance as Holly Goodhead. The returning Jaws and the fight between 007 and henchman Chang in the Venini Glass store were quite entertaining. Jaws was unfortunately not much of a threat to Bond, being used as comic relief throughout the movie and probably turned as a ""good guy"" due to his popularity with the younger audience. In The thirty silly minutes in space and having Frederick Gray & M go on the field to see the Drax laboratory (why would they ever do this?) isn't enough to tarnish a very good film. Moonraker is one of Roger Moore's best Bond, and easily better than The Spy Who Loved Me. We can look at the positives. The opening half hour is quite excellent, full of drama, brilliant dialogue, lots of real spying, and genuine suspense and action. Plus a beautiful, haunting theme song performed by Shirley Bassey.All as good as if not better than anything TSWLM had to offer. Even after that, we are treated to wonderful locations, more real spying (in Vienna), a terrific fight in a glass factory, and the eerie beauty of the Amazonian siren sequence. But all of this is offset by some of the series most ludicrous scenes. Dolly! Jaws becomes a wimp! Funny little spacemen shooting lasers! The cable car fight! That Bondola! And so on. Rating 9.9/10",Moonraker
270,Adrienne517,Movie bears no resemblance to the novel it's based on,2,13 December 2014,"I can understand the producers wanting to cash in the sudden interest in science fiction at the time this movie was released, but Moonraker was pathetically obvious. It bears no resemblance to the novel it was based on with actors phoning in their performances.The casting of Roger Moore as Bond was a poor choice from the beginning. The producers liked that people would believe his success with women. This would be the only trait Moore would share with Bond. He was too aristocratic for the role. James Bond is basically a streetfighter in a tuxedo and Moore was slow and unconvincing in his fight scenes.Lois Chiles was monotone as an actress and never really in the moment with her character.The only thing I've really been able to appreciate in this movie is John Barry's music. Why put all these other respectable production values into a lousy script and below-par actors? Moonraker deserves to go to the bottom of the Bond film franchise. For the best, look for On Her Majesty's Secret Service.",Moonraker
271,iandel-10663,Bond goes into outer space - and beyond reality,5,7 April 2021,"Of all the Bond films that deserve a remake, Moonraker has to be it. This is a huge pity, because Moonraker featured great locations and action sequences. The central problem is that it lacked a plausible and coherent storyline.The impressiveness of the action sequences was undermined by the fact that they arose virtually out of nowhere. One moment Bond is on a gondola in Venice, the next he is confronted by murderous assassins in a funeral cortege. How did his pursuers know where he was in such a short space of time? Jaws conveniently turns up at Sugar Loaf mountain just as Bond encounters Holly Goodhead again. After they escape Bond's fight on the cable car, an ambulance crew employed by Drax arrive on the scene to take them captive. Then Jaws re-enters seemingly out of the blue when Bond is exploring a remote river in the Amazon. The only thing I could infer from this is that Bond's adversaries were either psychic or had a remarkable sense of timing.There was also poor continuity in the plot. In the earlier part of the film Bond's temporary love interest Corinne Dufour is murdered by Drax when he learns of her betrayal, but Bond never gets to find out. In Christopher Wood's novelisation of the film, Bond learns about Corinne's death (in the novel she is called Trudi Parker) from Holly when he meets her in Venice.Overall I had the sense that the film moved quite fast and didn't develop a solid or believable storyline. Its use of tongue in cheek humour coupled with unrealistic contraptions such as the transformation of a gondola into a speedboat then hovercraft consigned this one to the realms of sheer fantasy.",Moonraker
272,terence666,Moonraker is a super edition to the series!!,7,30 May 2007,"I am i great fan of roger Moore and the way he portrays bond, moon raker is another good film which sees bond investigate the disappearance of space shuttle. Along the way he encounters hair-raising moments in the film such as the tangle with jaws on the cable car. This film is heavily underrated which i don't really understand, the part i would criticise would be jaws turning into a good guy and getting a girlfriend ha, but the prospect of bond going into space is a new experience in the series and it needs to be there as well.Overall i really enjoyed moon raker and roger Moore's portrayal!",Moonraker
273,BondFan90,An out of this world Bond film!,10,20 October 2016,"What can i say about Moonraker? The 11th film in the James Bond series, directed by Lewis Gilbert in his final Bond film.The film starts with a space shuttle being transported on a Boeing 747 by the RAF. (Second appearance of Kim Fortune. He played the British navy crew member in TSWLM, who is gunned down in the climactic battle in the finale.) The shuttle is stolen in mid air and James Bond has to find it. Before that, we get a thrilling set piece, where Bond is pushed out of a plane by Jaws, without a parachute. I wish they'd do stunts like that today! The title song, by Shirley Bassey, isn't my favourite because the lyrics make no sense! What is a Moonraker? Shirley's voice is haunting, though.There is a memorable sequence, where Bond is stuck in a centrifuge training machine and the emergency stop switch has been disconnected. Roger's Bond usually comes away from scrapes without a scratch, but on this occasion, he's really shaken up. That's a nice change.Michael Lonsdale is brilliant as Hugo Drax. A French businessman, who wants to commit global genocide and repopulate the earth with genetically perfect specimens.Lois Chiles plays Holly Goodhead, the lead Bond girl. She's wooden, but she's nice to look at.The late great, Richard Kiel returns as Jaws, in his final appearance in the Bond series. There is a surprising development in the character of Jaws. I won't spoil it for you though.Fantastic score by John Barry, one of his best!10/10",Moonraker
274,joerocker,One of the Best Bonds,9,7 March 2004,"When first I saw this movie I was 13 years old so I have fond memories of it being a Bond fan myself.When I watch it now, it doesn't feel the same because the movie industry has progressed a lot since 1979. But for its time, its a very good production. The movie did cost a lot and made well in ticket sales.I know that at times the fight scenes aren't great but still has classic Bond elements.It has Great stunts (the opening is one of the best in the series),exotic locations, beautiful women,devious villians and nice humorous lines.Some people today mock ,criticize or belittle James Bond as too difficult to believe or something silly.But James Bond isn't about real life or your average spy. He is a larger than life persona and the embodiment of the best secret agent.That is why when a Bond movie comes out, people around the world go and watch it.Plus the ticket sales would be awesome. People like like to live in a fantasy for a couple of hours watching their favourite hero save the world again and again. So if Bond wasn't so popular then the series wouldn't have made it past 3 movies.The people who wrongly criticize Bond movies, should try to make one.I am sure that all the producers around the world have tried to imitate Bond in making spy movies or use stuff that are found in his movies only to fail to surpass the legend.Imagine that the Bond film makers have to outdo themselves each time a Bond movie comes out.So for those people, try to take each Bond according to each time and you will see that its one of the best of its time.There are a lot of cinematic techniques that have been revolutionized through the Bond movies as well as record breaking stunts and gadgetry.Moonraker is a great Bond movie.Roger Moore is a wonderful actor and plays his role well.James Bond is about tradition and legacy so get used to it, enjoy the show or try watching something else.",Moonraker

The thing that made it so revolting was the scenes with Jaws and finding that girl and the premise that he goes from trying to kill Bond and then becomes his friend was so bad. And stealing a space shuttle gave the impression that the producers wanted to give a futuristic spin on the series and it flopped big time. Thank God they got back on track with For Your Eyes Only. An excellent plot driven movie. I skipped seeing Moonraker for a long time cause i heard it was awful, i wished i never saw it because it was 10 times worse than i thought it would be! So take my advice, skip this movie at all costs and see For Your Eyes Only or Man With The Golden Gun instead.",Moonraker

On the positive side it also has a lot of really good action scenes, which kept me glued really. The locations and camera angles are really fantastic, especially in comparison to the previous few Bond movies. Roger Moore of course is brilliant as Bond and I feel this was the movie when he really got into the character and made it his own with his unique style. Lois Chilles is one of the most intriguing Bond women and certainly one of the most likable. And to top it all we have some really mean villains. On the other hand there are some of the old Bond clichés in the movie, and a few scenes that seem a little unbelievable, especially for those used to the latest Bond movies which are so serious in their plots. And Perhaps Michael Londsale does not compare to great Bond villains like Goldfinger or Raoul Silva.

277,david_lockett,Bond for the kiddie set,4,10 April 2006,"One of the least interesting in the James Bond series, Moonraker is big and dumb and bears no resemblance to the superb thriller penned by Ian Fleming. This is the movie where Bond goes into space to prevent madman Hugo Drax from destroying human kind with the poison from orchids (in the novel Drax only wanted to destroy London with a rocket). Idiocy is rife throughout, from Drax's comical henchmen notably Jaws (who was menacing in The Spy Who Loved Me) to Space shuttles that blast off at a moments notice as though it's as easy as taking off in a Cessna. There's also Drax's space station that is invisible from radar (yes, but optical telescopes and the naked eye don't require radar). The increasing globe trotting nature of the nutty Q (Desmond Llewellyn) is quite absurd also, remember way back in the early Bond's when he was just a common functionary in the bowels of the secret service building. The best scenes are the free fall moments from a plane in the pre-title sequence, Bond's spin (literally) in a centrifuge machine and the death of Hugo Drax's secretary (who Bond has bedded) at the hands of some vicious mastiffs - a scene that is a bit jarring amongst the rest of the campy and less serious than usual action scenes. Those that enjoy the zany and campy such as the 60's Batman and Dean Martin's Matt Helm movies may love this but the Bond character (and the situations)are too far removed from Fleming's version for any satisfaction.",Moonraker
278,eon014,"Just proves that Bond should set trends, rather than follow them",3,4 September 2006,"Moonraker is widely considered to be among the worst of the Bond films. So, where do I start with this? The pre-credits sequence seems appropriate. Some kind of disaster happens, M is informed and instructs Moneypenny to retrieve 007, Bond is seen canoodling a beautiful girl who turns out to betray him, Bond escapes death by doing some death-defying stuns. (yawn) It feels like we've seen it all before, and that's exactly because we have, in the form of 'The Spy Who Loved Me'. Everything about Moonraker is basically the same as the previous film.Firstly, the plot is a straight copy. An incredibly wealthy businessman plans to wipe out the human race and create a new civilisation (this time in space, as opposed to under the sea). Bond is paired up with a fellow secret agent (this time from the CIA) and investigates the villains plan and eventually foils it at the last possible moment. I suppose the fact the screenplay is by Christopher Wood (an experienced comedy writer) who also wrote 'Spy' doesn't help. There is little originality in the script and it often resorts to cheap jokes to complete the otherwise dull scenes.Roger Moore's Bond is at his most flippant here and is occasionally downright rude (quite similar to Connery in Goldfinger or Thunderball). He makes constant patronising remarks against Dr Holly Goodhead (and women in general) and even when Bond tries to be funny he falls flat on his face. Holly Goodhead is perhaps the most uninteresting Bond girl in the series. Though she doesn't exactly make a convincing CIA agent, the audience admires Holly for being able to put up with Bond's remarks without slapping him, and she often shoots him down with her sardonic replies. Hugo Drax has the potential to be one of the best villains, though sadly it is wasted. Michael Lonsdale is a great actor and he does have some of the best lines in the whole film, but he is given little else to do than think up schemes to kill 007. (Though admittedly, he does come closer to succeeding than any previous Bond villain) One of the main atrocities of Moonraker is the return of Jaws. This time he becomes a walking barrel of 'laughs', and is even given a girlfriend, who happens to be half his height (oh Mr Wood, you're killing us with these jokes!)The set pieces are just plain ridiculous, the Bondola scene is the most pathetic idea ever for a James Bond film, I'm astonished this made the final cut (Ian Fleming would be spinning in his grave). The parachute jump is hardly exciting either as it is ruined by the 'circus music', and the final space battle looks incredibly cheap (even for 1979 it looks dated, Star Wars did a much better job just two years earlier). One particularly nasty sequence worth mentioning involves one of Drax's assistants, Corinne Du For, being hunted down and killed by his two Doberman dogs.Just in case the first 2 thirds of the film aren't dull enough for the audience, Moonraker gets even worse when Bond leaves the planet in a stolen space rocket. The whole idea of James Bond going into space in the first place is just absurd anyway. Bond used to be about espionage and secrecy, not laser battles in outer space. Also, how did Bond suddenly become world famous? He is supposed to be a SECRET AGENT for god's sake and yet he is recognised wherever he goes.Moonraker is just plagued with problems from the start. The hero is a sexist pig as opposed to a charming gentleman spy, the plot just about hangs together thanks to ludicrous coincidences and the whole film in general just lacks the 'spark' that James Bond films are supposed to have. You can't help wondering why this film was even made in the first place. So, the Hollywood trend at the time was sci-fi movies, but James Bond doesn't follow trends, he sets them!",Moonraker
279,Gsk,Calmly saving the world,7,24 October 1998,"The Roger Moore Bond movies are pleasant - The rather nonchalant Bond travels across the world, and in this movie also beyond it, as  something like a tourist with an interest in saving the world, seducing an unheard of number of women, having a few fights and managing to stay alive and distract the megalomaniac long enough to preserve civilization as we know it.This Bond-movie is neither worse nor better than the other Roger Moore Bonds. It's always a good thing to have Jaws there.  The plot moves slowly but steadily towards its climax, making the movie rather a comfortable and not too tense view. I missed a scene or two where Bond didn't seem to be in control.Highlights were the scenery of Drax's resicence, a fight in a glass museum, the simula-tour and Roger Moore's expressionless face when driving through Venice in - you'll see. 7 out of 10.",Moonraker

However this film suffers from a ridiculous plot (even for a bond film), terrible special effects, a disappointing theme tune and a supporting cast that would look out of place on the set of JAG.These downfalls are overcome by the blazing performance of Moore. even though he looks like he could qualify for his bus pass, Moore is still sharper than Martin Lawerence covered in broken glass.

Its exotic locales are certainly among the best, not the least of which being Venice and Rio de Janeiro.  Jaws is brought back by popular demand, and in the end, he becomes a good guy this time!  Most of all, though, this time Bond actually goes into space, and if you think about it, the stakes are much higher.  Most of the time, the villains just want to hold America and its allies feet to the fire for some ransom (or revenge, or both, take your pick), but this time, the bad guy's actually out to wipe out the whole human race.  Last but not least, I'd argue that Lois Chiles as Dr. Holly Goodhead is one of the hottest of all the Bond girls.  Oh sure, many would argue she's not the ABSOLUTE hottest, but you've got to admit, she ranks right up there!I will admit that the theme song isn't the best, but in the end, that's small potatoes compared to the movie itself (plus, the pre-credit free-fall scene sort of makes up for that anyhow).  Still, it was nice for them to bring back Shirley Bassey to do the singing again (previous credits:  the themes from ""Goldfinger"" and ""Diamonds Are Forever"").

It has a likable hero, lots of puns, one-liners, cartoonish villains, spaceships, and even a laser battle (PEW PEW PEW)! I've watched it again recently and I have to disagree with the 8-year-old me: it is not the greatest film of all time. But who cares? It still is a lot of fun! The opening sequence or the cable-car fight for instance, those scenes are as thrilling as it gets!

Never before in a Bond movie had anyone had such superhuman powers ... never before had a Bond movie lose as much credibility in my mind.  Or how about that boat that Bond turns into a Hovercraft AND IT'S NOT EVEN A ""Q"" BOAT!!!!!  IT'S JUST SOME BOAT HE GOT INTO!!!!!!!!!!  There are action sequences that make no sense, why were the bad guys there???  The whole movie followed no rhyme or reason, it was painful to watch.",Moonraker
291,sigma-1,"Excellent, but heavily criticised, disliked, and underrated.",10,26 December 2001,"One of the prime reasons this film was disliked is because they disliked the space aspect, and some of the silly comic things. Although it does have mixed reviews. Many also rate it well. I didn't see anything wrong with this movie. Roger Moore's performance was fine, the villian wasn't horrible, and the women weren't terrible. Personally one of my favorite Bond films, and yes this is partly because I like things involving space. Another thing HEAVILY underrated is Jaws's performance. I saw nothing wrong with it. Yes, maybe they shouldn't have had him fall in love, but before this he was as evil as he was in the Spy who Loved Me. Maybe I overrated in giving it a 10/10, but after seeing this movie I was highly satisfied, and saw nothing wrong with it.",Moonraker

293,watsongirl,Good,6,12 March 2012,"It's interesting that some of the most beloved Bond films are also some of the worst (Thunderball, Diamonds Are Forever, For Your Eyes Only), and some of the most reviled are among the best (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Moonraker, The Living Daylights).This movie set a new high in entertainment value when it was released in 1979. It was the necessary upgrade of the franchise in the new era ushered in by Star Wars a couple of years earlier. It preserved the best of the genre (espionage intrigue, plot twists, Bond mystique, beautiful women, gadgets, humor, haunting cinematography, and mesmerizing music), but brought them out of the gloomy and cynical Cold War atmosphere and into a more futuristic and optimistic format. It kept the Bond franchise fun at a time when the standards for fun had taken a quantum leap.Roger Moore does a nice job in his last credible portrayal of 007. Alas, his age became increasingly distracting starting with the next outing.A lot of fun. Deserves much more credit than it is usually given.",Moonraker
294,kidneys,"Bond, Bond, Bond...",2,11 September 2005,"Cummon! this movie sucks! i do not know what those people were thinking. When looking for an intelligently plotted movie do not look here! This movie is turkey. It is poorly written ...and...and how can you even hijack spaceship? I mean this guy has enough money to build his own space ship to go into outerspace to hijack a spaceship? This movie just plain sucks. For those bond fans out there, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! I can honestly say that this is one of the suckiest movies that i have ever seen. The gadgets however were kinda cool but really all together this is not a movie worth seeing. The acting was OK and some of the punch lines were kinda funny and the actions scenes are pretty cool if you are into that kinda stuff. But i didn't like it at all. I give this piece of crap 2 stars.",Moonraker
