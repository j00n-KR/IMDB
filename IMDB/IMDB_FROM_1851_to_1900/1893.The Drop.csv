0,Leofwine_draca,A dragged-out low-key crime story,6,20 July 2017,"THE DROP is another gritty and realistic American crime drama of the kind that are all the rage. It stars the underrated Tom Hardy as a bartender who gets drawn into a murky world when his business is done over and he becomes implicated in the crime. Somewhat bizarrely, much of the character work in the film relates to an abused dog that Hardy finds and rescues, so animal lovers will probably enjoy these scenes. Hardy stars along with Noomi Rapace and the late James Gandolfini, for whom this was his last role before his sudden death. As a slow-burner, THE DROP is well put together and shot, but I kept thinking the story was mere build-up to something bigger, and then it ends, leaving me a little disappointed by the simplicity of the plotting.",The Drop
1,SnoopyStyle,Three great actors but Roskam misses slightly,6,6 February 2015,"Bartender Bob Saginowski (Tom Hardy) works at Cousin Marv's Bar and finds a puppy left in Nadia Dunn (Noomi Rapace)'s trash can. He reluctantly agrees to take the abused dog. A thug Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts) turns out to be the owner of the dog and Nadia's ex. Marv (James Gandolfini) allows gangsters to use the bar for cash drops from their illegal activities. Two masked men rob the bar. Detective Torres (John Ortiz) investigates. It turns out that Marv is the brains behind the robbery.There are three great actors in this. Gandolfini is terrific as always and gives his usual tough performance. Hardy is playing a nice quiet guy and it doesn't really fit him. I keep expecting him to punch out Deeds. It's better if the movie can show his intensity earlier. Instead, director Roskam made him a blank for most of the movie. He's not even quietly intense. Rapace's character is rather bland. She's playing the damsel in distress which doesn't give her as much opportunity. Both Hardy and Rapace are trying to play beneath their level. It's not until the last act that the intensity truly ramps up. Roskam could have done a lot more with Hardy but he leaves it all to the last act. The switch isn't as compelling as Roskam expects because that's the character the audience expects from Hardy anyways. The surprise is the first two thirds of the movie. Also Eric's threat is meaningless since he knows that Eric didn't kill the guy or the supposed phantom partner. So the question is what was Bob's plan by bringing both the $10k and the gun. It's probably not something that should be dissected too much. The other way to make the surprise reveal work is if Bob is played by a weakling. That's definitely not Tom Hardy. The movie has three great actors but it's not as good as it should be.",The Drop
2,Horst_In_Translation,Pretty good crime movie,6,29 October 2015,"""The Drop"" is a 105-minute movie from last year and it is actually the last work by actor James Gandolfini (""The Sopranos"") as this one came out almost a year after his untimely death. Rising stars Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace play the male and female lead, while Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts has a supporting part. The director is Michaël R. Roskam, who had his great breakthrough (together with Schoenaerts) with the Oscar-nominated ""Bullhead"" a couple years ago. The writer is Dennis Legane and if you have seen ""Mystic River"", ""Gone Baby Gone"" or ""Shutter Island"", you vaguely know what to expect.Two cousins run a bar, but it is really a drop, which means a spot where organized criminals get along with their business. Sadly, one of the cousins is not so eager and makes schemes to rob the bar on several occasions and steal the money from these Russian mafia mobsters. Not the best idea as you can imagine. Apart from that, an injured puppy, a brutal ex-boyfriend, a waitress and a somewhat innocent bartender play big roles in this pretty atmospheric crime thriller. This is not really about the police solving cases here. It's way too big for them anyway. It's more about watching crime unfold in all kinds of situations from start to finish.I enjoyed watching this movie and even if I am not the biggest Hardy or Rapace fan, I thought both did a fine job in terms of acting here, just like everybody else, especially the late Gandolfini. Pretty good movie. It's nothing Oscar worthy and there are maybe only 1 or 2 moments of real greatness, which is not enough for me to be really enthusiastic about it (one would be the phone moment between the cousins near the end), but it is enjoyable from start to finish and never really drags. Thumbs up and I recommend it.",The Drop
3,Prismark10,Drop Bar,4,29 September 2015,"The Drop is a low key brooding crime thriller set in Brooklyn by acclaimed writer Dennis Lehane.Bartender Bob (Tom Hardy) works at Marv's Bar which used to be owned by his cousin Marv (James Gandolfini) but since he had gambling problems, it is now operated by gangsters and used as a drop bar where gangsters periodically use it to make cash drops.One night the bar is robbed for $5000 by two masked men and the robbery is investigated by Detective Torres (John Ortiz) who thinks Bob knows more about the robbery than he is letting on. The bar owned by Chechen gangsters are not happy the lengths that Bob and Marv are going to find out who robbed them.At the same time Bob finds an abused dog in Nadia Dunn's (Noomi Rapace) garbage can and looks after it. Bob is then troubled by local hoodlum Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts) who claims to own the dog and was Nadia's ex-boyfriend. Eric makes threatening noises to Bob and is rumoured the Eric killed a man.Marv is acting rather paranoid and thinks that Eric bothering Bob might be connected somehow to the robbery.The Drop was James Gandolfini's last film. He gives a largely understated performance. A man who was once a loan shark, who was somebody and feared until his problems brought him down. Bob is a person who could had amounted to something but never took that bold step. However as Marv notes he has a steely edge to him.The Drop is an actor's movie. Hardy is there with his full on Brooklyn accent, everyone gives a good but edgy performance. Although Rapace's character is a bit sketchy and Hardy's character seems to be too laid back for a lot of the film.The biggest problem is that from the opening narration you have the sense of seen it all before and it was directed by Martin Scorcese. Nothing is really much a surprise so you kind of guess the twists. Even then the story is rather messy and convoluted although it does point to Marv having botched ideas.",The Drop
4,nogodnomasters,I just tend bar,8,5 July 2018,"Bob (Tom Hardy) tends bar for his cousin Marv (James Gandolfini). He is slow to speak and appears to be a bit of a dim wit. This isn't just any Brooklyn bar, but a drop bar for Chechnya mobsters. Money made at night from drugs, gambling and prostitution get dropped off at a random bar, sometimes this bar. One night the bar gets robbed, which happened to be a drop night. This leads to a plot that twists and gets deep, with clues and a puppy thrown in. Swedish born Noomi Rapace seemed right at home with a Brooklyn accent.The film is a low action crime drama and a mystery that you didn't know was a mystery.Good performances to create drab characters. Not a film for those who like a lot of action with larger than life characters making instant catch phrases.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",The Drop
5,kosmasp,A drop that's up there,8,15 February 2015,"If you didn't have Tom Hardy on your radar up to this movie, you surely will have him on it after watching this. There is another stellar performance from James Gandolfini, whom regrettably we lost too early, but this is Hardys movie through and through. With Noomi making an impact too as the female lead of the piece.But while I am excited about the movie and others obviously are too, do not expect this to be a fast paced ride that will be exciting in that style. This is understated and subtle and slow burning. If you can dig that, you will experience a great story, with great characters with some neat surprises along the way. The deliveries are on the money (no pun intended)",The Drop
6,jboothmillard,The Drop,4,24 June 2020,"I kept missing this film on television a few times, I knew it was one of if not the final film that the star of The Sopranos starred in before his death from a heart attack, but I did manage to finally watch it and hoped it would be worth it. Basically, set in Brooklyn, New York, Bob Saginowsky (Tom Hardy) is a bartender at a neighbourhood bar. Marvin Stipler (James Gandolfini), the bar's former owner and Bob's cousin, after giving it up to the Chechen mafia years ago, operates it with Bob as a 'drop' for illegal takings. One night, after finding an abandoned pit bull puppy in a garbage can, he meets Nadia (Noomi Rapace), and leaves the dog in her care until he can decide what to do with it. When the bar is robbed by two masked gunmen, Marv is annoyed that Bob gives information to investigating Detective Torres (John Ortiz). Chechen thug Chovka (Michael Aronov) later threatens Marv and Bob and tells them that they must make up for the stolen money. It is revealed that the robbery was orchestrated by Fitz (James Frecheville), and a discussion between Marv and his sister, Dottie (The Handmaid's Tale's Ann Dowd), reveals that Marv needs to continue payments to help his father who is on life support. Bob decides to keep the dog and names him Rocco, and bonds with Nadia, who reveals that she was formerly suicidal following a past addiction to drugs. Whilst walking the dog, Bob is approached by Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts), who later appears at his house revealing he is the real owner of the dog, he wants him returned or will get the police involved. Later, Bob and Marv find a bag containing a severed arm along with the stolen money at the bar. Bob is unnerved when Deeds appears at the bar, revealing he is a friend of Nadia, but Marv informs him that Deeds may have murdered a man named Richie Whelan ten years ago. Nadia confesses to Bob that she and Deeds used to date, while he and Marv return the money to the Chechens, who tell them that the bar will be the drop site for the night of the Super Bowl. Marv tries to convince Fitz to rob the bar again on the night of the Super Bowl, but he kills him when he refuses to do so. Marv then recruits Deeds to rob the bar, who later confronts Bob demanding $10,000, threatening to harm the dog. Bob becomes suspicious of Marv when he calls claiming to being sick on the day of the Super Bowl. On Super Bowl night, taking the dog with him, Bob takes $10,000 hidden in his basement and hides it behind the bar counter, with a pistol. Deeds breaks into Nadia's home and forces her to go to the bar with him to watch the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, Marv vars his car nearby, with the trunk lined with plastic, parked near the bar, watching various mobsters drop off money throughout the night. Eventually the bar clears except for Deeds and Nadia. Deeds refuses Bob's offer of $10,000 for Rocco, then threatens to kill Nadia if he does not open the safe. While they wait, Bob tells a story about killing a customer who had won a huge casino jackpot, taking the money to help Marv, and disposing od the body, and it is revealed the victim of Richie Whelan, who Deeds has always taken credit for killing. Bob then draws his gun and shoots Deeds in the neck and then in the face at point-blank range, terrifying Nadia. The Chechens dispose of Deeds' body and collect the money from the drop. Chovka indicates to Bob that he was aware of Marv's deceit. While Marv is shot to death in his car, Chovka provides Bob ownership of the bar as a reward for his loyalty. In his head, Bob feels remorse for the murder of Whelan and fears that his sins have cursed him to be forever lonely. Detective Torres visits Bob at the bar to offer condolences over Marv's death, which Bob assumes was a carjack gone wrong, while Torres believes he was executed. Torres asks Bob questions about Deeds and his impossible involvement in the death of Whelan, being in a psychiatric ward the night Whelan went missing. Torres then insinuates that Bob is responsible for both Deeds' and Whelan's disappearances. Later, Bob visits Nadia and hopes to reconcile, asking her if she wants to see him again. Nadia offers to take a walk with him and the dog, but Bob hears the door jingle and he smiles as the footsteps approach, it is unclear who it is or what was about to happen. Also starring Elizabeth Rodriguez as Detective Romsey. Hardy gives a reasonable performance as the buttoned-up loner, Rapace has some alright moments, but it is indeed Gandolfini in his last performance that is most memorable as the man doing the money laundering and dodgy deals. To be honest, I could not fully follow everything going on, apart from that the bar was where all the criminal stuff was happening, all the Eastern European gang stuff is a little complicated for me, and the pace was a bit uneven, overall a rather average crime drama. Okay!",The Drop
7,blanche-2,"tense, dark, and James Gandolfini's last performance",8,4 December 2015,"Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, Naomi Rapace, and Matthias Schoenaerts star in ""The Drop"" from 2014. With a script written by Dennis Lehane, good direction by Michael R. Roskam, and brilliant acting, this is an excellent film.Bob Saginowski (Hardy) works at a bar formerly owned by his cousin Marv (Gandolfini), now mob-run, which means that every once in a while, the bar is the drop for the mob's collections.When masked men hold up the bar and get $5,000, Bob has to find a way to make it up - it's the night's take; the mob money was already collected. To the chagrin of Marv, Bob tells a police detective (John Ortiz) a little too much, giving him a clue to finding the crooks.When Bob finds a pit bull puppy in the trash, he befriends the woman who lives in the house, Nadia (Rapace) who tends to the dog, which is wounded, and helps Bob buy supplies, etc. Then a man shows up, a psycho named Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts), claiming that the dog is his and wanting him back. Bob refuses. One night he realizes Deeds has been in his house; then he finds out that he has a connection with Nadia.This is the story of two pit bulls - Bob and his dog, Rocco. I'm assuming the script was written with the impression that pit bulls are vicious. Pit bulls are not inherently vicious; they are trained to be, and even then, they can be retrained and make great pets. Pit bulls want to please their masters. Watch Pit Bulls and Parolees some time.Anyway, the script wasn't written with that in mind, but with the mistaken reputation of pit bulls, I think. Bob is a quiet man who comes off as sweet and unassuming, but inside he has a strength no one could believe from his exterior. And Rocco, an adorable pup, beaten and thrown in the trash, has the right stuff as well, surviving a miserable beginning.Tom Hardy is magnificent as Bob - totally American; he is truly film's male chameleon, believable as a quiet bartender who tries to stay out of the way.Gandolfini, in his last performance, is great - he has a monologue toward the end of the film that is quite powerful - he's a man who has seen his dreams shattered and chosen the wrong road. Rapace is perfect a Nadia, a wounded woman who wants to be close but whose suspicions get in the way. As Eric Deeds, Matthias Schoenaerts will keep you on the edge of your seat. He speaks softly but you're never sure what he's going to do next.I think the performances are better than the film and raise it to a higher level. It's a good movie, and a dark one, but in the hands of other actors could easily have been written off, given that the story is derivative.""The Drop"" is a must see if you're a James Gandolfini fan and to see the amazing Tom Hardy. And Rocco, a puppy star.",The Drop
8,edwagreen,The Drop Falls Down **,4,18 August 2015,"Confusing due to the inept writing. We reach a point that we don't know what's really going on here. Everyone almost nearly turns out as psychopaths.Bob and Marvin operate a bar, think of their glory days and were quite violent fellows as shown as the film goes on.In later years, the bar has been used for funneling illegally made money and when it is held up, those whose money was taken want action and will resort to violence to obtain their objectives.Gandolfini is excellent as Marv, the foul-mouthed bar owner resorting to ultimate murder, and Mr. Hardy, as his cousin Bob, is quite good as the mild-mannered guy who has quite a past and isn't as sheepish as the plot seems to lay out.",The Drop
9,hitchcockthelegend,Are you doing something desperate? Something we can't clean up this time?,8,20 February 2017,"The Drop is directed by Michael R. Roskam and written by Dennis Lehane, who adapts from his own short story titled Animal Rescue. It stars Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, Noomi Rapace and Matthias Schoenaerts. Music is by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Nicolas Karakatsanis.Brooklyn barman Bob Saginowski (Hardy) spies an opportunity for a better life - but only if he can escape family ties, the crime that surrounds him and a dark past It's arguably a tricky film to recommend with confidence given that it doesn't sit still in crime genre company. This is very much a character based story about a small handful of people affected by crime, where they are chained to events occurring by way of law breaking. Roskam is in no hurry what so ever to spin his picture's literary worth, very much favouring a slow burn - even low key - approach. He deftly develops atmosphere whilst simultaneously ensuring we the viewers are very much a part of the setting and situations - something Lehane does so brilliantly in his novels. By the time the pic plays its hand, what appeared at first to be needless complexities, are valid and close the piece down with some considerable success. 7.5/10",The Drop
10,LeonLouisRicci,Nothing Lights Up the Screen Like a Bunch of Dim Bulbs,7,3 April 2015,"A Slice of Brooklyn Street Life is the Setting for this Actor's Showcase Featuring Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, and James Gandolfini. The Supporting Characters are Shallow and don't Add Much to the Proceedings as the Cop, the Main Bad Guy, and the European Gang are all pretty much One Dimensional and Never Waiver Beyond Stereotype.But the Lead Trio and the Curbside Bar Setting is Enough to make this rather Simple Story about a Strong Simple Man and His Chosen Crime Environment, Interesting and Involving. Whether You Make it to the End will Depend upon the amount of Care You Invest in these Dim Bulbs.No one On Screen is particularly Smart or Charming, just somewhat Ordinary but Adaptive. In this World, the Survivors are Not the Ones with the most Money or Muscle, but the ones with the most Misdirection. You Might See the End Coming but Maybe Not. Overall, Worth a Watch for its Allure about the Underbelly of City Life, the Last Role for James Gandolfini, and Fans of Tom Hardy (and there are many) who may be a bit Overrated as an Actor, but gives this Role another Mumbling Mannered Performance that His Fans seem to Admire.

11,writers_reign,First Chance Saloon,8,15 November 2014,"Dennis Lehane's setting of choice for his novels is Boston and in his case it's a Boston with little or no resemblance to either the Boston of John P. Marquand or the Boston of Robert B. Parker. I haven't read his short fiction so it well may be that he does employ a wider canvas there as in his story Animal Shelter, the work upon which he has based his own screenplay, The Drop, and which is set in Brooklyn. It's a development of what used to be called the 'thick-ear' gangster picture and it is set in a world that is very much 21st century where violence is the norm and Chechens rule the roost. The principal setting is a bar ostensibly owned by an uncle who runs it with the help of a nephew. In reality it is owned by the Chechens and is one of several bars that are used as 'drops' for 'dirty' i.e. drugs, prostitution, protection, numbers, money, collected by 'bag'men from all four points of the city in small amounts. There is nothing to single out Marv's Bar as a drop but it is known to an element who see it as a piggy band and two robberies comprise the bookends of the plot. Exceptional performances put this well into the recommended category.",The Drop

The Chechens aren't happy and demand that Marv and Bob get back their money...Decent crime-drama. Feels quite clumsy at times - the plot development is far from slick. However, the intrigue and suffocating tension of the movie are built well and the climax of the movie is well worth the wait. Solid work by Tom Hardy in the lead role.

13,oscaralbert,"""No one sees you coming . . . """,10,24 September 2014,""" . . . do they, Bob?"" Lt. Torres asks bartender Bob in the next-to-last scene of THE DROP. The American Humane Society gave this story--originally entitled ANIMAL RESCUE--its ""four paws up"" rating. It's not hard to see why. It's like Tom Hardy's ""Bob"" is a dog catcher for rabid humans. Speaking of the latter, James Gandolfini clearly undertook a killer role here, just as Heath Ledger did in HIS final flick--THE DARK KNIGHT--and Phillip Seymour Hoffman did with HIS curtain call, A MOST WANTED MAN. It seems that actors are not as good as actresses in leaving the baggage of their darker roles ""at work."" Just as the AHAD must give its stamp of approval to most movies widely released in America featuring critters, it seems that SAG (that is, the Screen Actor's Guild) should step up and do the same thing for our top acting talent, if the recent carnage is any indication. Athletes have to remain ALIVE a reasonable amount of time after setting new world records for their feats to be officially recognized. On the other hand, though someone like Ledger might ""win"" a posthumous Oscar now and then, these Hollywood writing and producer bozos are ramming all this dark matter down their throats without even the safeguards given to the pit bulls who appear on-screen (such as ""Rocco"" in THE DROP).

Rapace is a damaged goods local girl who meets cute with Hardy bonding over a battered pit bull puppy. Fine ensemble including Ortiz as a local police detective investigating several crimes encompassing the pub and Schoenaerts as a spooky thug that gets Hardy simmering a low boil when he's not busy doing a dese/dem/dose accent and echoes of Brando in ON THE WATERFRONT as a dim-bulb whose shrewd persona he wears like a mask.

15,neil-476,Somewhat on the slow and dull side,7,21 November 2014,"Bob is bartender at his cousin Marv's bar: this is a drop bar where criminals drop cash to be collected later for laundering. There is a robbery (which, unknown to the Chechens whose money has been stolen, Marv orchestrates), an Bob finds an abused and discarded pitbull puppy on the way home which, with the help of neighbour Nadia, he adopts, only for small-time bully and crook Deeds to say it is his puppy and he wants it back unless Bob pays him for it.Dennis Lehane wrote the books on which the films Shutter Island, Mystic River, and Gone, Baby, Gone were based, among much other familiar material, and wrote the screenplay for this film based on his own short story Animal Rescue. And that's the main problem: it was a short story and, despite having two distinct threads (the robbery and the puppy), there is far too little material here to sustain this film for its 106 minute running time, despite good performances from Tom Hardy as Bob and James Gandolfini, in his last film, as Marv. Consequently it is slow and dull. It would have fitted an hour TV slot (ie 40 minutes running time) much better.Two more odd points: I'm thinking of renaming Noomi Rapace as Gloomy Rapace. She really doesn't do a great deal for me as an actress. And there is a very effective shock moment towards the end which rather overturns some of the expectations you had been building up. So, if you see it, see it all the way through, even if you find it somewhat sluggish.",The Drop
16,ferguson-6,I Like Mike,7,12 September 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Much of what I write here contradicts my long maintained stance that a strong story/script is the basis for any movie worth it's proverbial weight. This neighborhood crime drama does not spin a twisty plot. Nor does it flash fascinating and colorful mobsters. Instead, it's the acting that elevates this to the point of neo-noir must see.This is James Gandolfini's final movie. He passed away while director Michael Roskam (Bullhead) was in editing mode. Gandolfini plays Cousin Marv, a would-be wise-guy who never-really-was and is now bitter and desperate, in a beaten down kind of way. As a farewell, Gandolfini leaves us a final reminder of what a powerful screen presence he was, and what a terrific feel for character and scene he possessed.The real attraction and the main reason to see the film is the outstanding and mesmerizing performance of Tom Hardy. In many ways, his bartender Bob is the polar opposite of his infamous Bane from The Dark Knight Rises. Quasi-effeminate in his vocal deliverings, and moving with a slow, stilted shuffle, Bob is one of the least imposing guys you would likely look right through. At least that's the first impression. Hardy is so nuanced, we aren't even certain when his character evolves and exposes his true make-up. When he does, it's the highlight of the film.Noomi Rapace, in yet another intriguing turn, plays local waitress Nadia, who befriends Bob after he rescues an abused puppy. Since the movie is based on Dennis Lehane's short story ""Animal Rescue"", it's no surprise that the main characters each share a need to be rescued. Nadia's ex-boyfriend is played to full creepy effect by Matthias Schoenaerts (so great in Rust and Bone, 2012). The scenes between Schoenaerts and Hardy show the movie at its tension-filled best.As with most neighborhood crime dramas, there are many secrets, local legends, and allegiances in doubt. The players are weary and dream of either better times or ending the misery. Mr. Lehane wrote the novels that led to some other fine films: Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, and Shutter Island. He has a feel for realistic characters, and his material depends on extraordinary acting for fulfillment. This slow boil benefits from some of the best acting we could ask for.",The Drop
17,anaconda-40658,Gandolfini Drops His Final Great Performance.,10,15 September 2015,"The Drop (2014): Dir: Michael R. Roskam / Cast: Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, Noomi Rapace, Matthias Schoenaerts, John Ortiz: Great crime thriller with a title that, on the surface, references the moving of cash. Symbolically it regards the descending nature of humanity. Tom Hardy plays a bartender named Bob Saginowski who discovers a dog in the trash on the way home. This allows him an encounter with Nadia, played by Noomi Rapace, who assists him with caring for the dog as well as hinting possible romance. His boss is Cousin Marv, played by James Gandolfini. One evening they are robbed at gunpoint and large amounts of cash is stolen. While police nose about, the real cash owners apply brutal tactics to ensure their money resurfaces. While quite violent, director Michael R. Roskam presents an effective crime thriller where the characters are broad and appealing as oppose to the standard action film targets for death. Hardy delivers a strong performance as a humbling individual attempting to walk the right line while sometimes skirting to the left. Gandolfini as Marv feels respect fading and desperation setting in as he gets in too deep. Rapace is refreshing as she sees opportunity in new beginning with Hardy while nursing a troubled past. Matthias Schoenaerts plays the menacing Eric Deeds who claims to be the rightful owner of Hardy's dog as well as being Rapace's threatening ex-boyfriend. John Ortiz plays a police investigator who preaches to Hardy about Church attendance while edging closer to the comfort zone for which answers await. Crime doesn't pay but one can drop the lifestyle and prevail to higher opportunities. Score: 10 / 10",The Drop

On his way home one night, Bob rescues an injured puppy that's been put in the garbage of a woman, and adopts the dog and begins dating the woman.But the bar is robbed, causing Bob and Marv grief, possibly more, with the bar's Chechin owners. As Bob tries to put everything straight, his new beaus former boyfriend comes on the scene, making life even more difficult for Bob.....From the trailer, from the poster, to the fact that it's set in Brooklyn, and that it stars Gandolfini, it's going to be your standard, run of the mill, meat and potatoes crime thriller, which it is.And this is the movies plus, and downside.The plus side is, it's got three brilliant actors in central performances, and as you would expect, they all put in stellar performances. Its taut, tense in places, and has a nice little twist to the movie.The downsides to the movie are all the usual ones you'd expect. We've seen it all a dozen times before, and even though the film does have a nice little twist, its a twist you can see coming from a mile off.So all in all, it's just an average run of the mill thriller about money and deceit, with brilliant performances that we have seen time and time before.Wreaking of Lumet, Mamet, and Scorecese, The Drop has so much potential to be a groundbreaking crime movie, but unlike Hardy's brilliant accent, they decide to play it safe.All that was missing was a cameo from De Niro owning a deli, with Pesci narrating it, and The Drop would have ticked all the boxes.Not a bad movie by any means, just way too safe, and way too predictable.",The Drop
19,gradyharp,'They never see you coming; do they Bob?',10,25 January 2015,"Dennis Lehane wrote the screenplay of his short story 'Animal Rescue' and Michaël R. Roskam directs. The film is a difficult one to classify – in part it is a family drama, a love story, a gang drama, and a mystery. But no matter how you chose to label it, it is a very, very fine little film. The cast is excellent down to the smallest part, the manner in which the 'mystery' unwinds is mesmerizing and surprising, and the cinematography by Nicolas Karakatsanis and the musical score by Marco Beltrami and Raf Keunen are particularly fine. Bob Saginowski (Tom Hardy in very fine form with a terrific Brooklyn accent) seems a bit slow witted (or does he simply have something to hide?) tends bar in his cousin Marv's (James Gandolfini, superb as always) bar. This run down Brooklyn bar is actually a drop bar for a Chechnya gang headed by Chovka (Michael Aronov): money made at night from drugs, gambling and prostitution get dropped off at a random bar, sometimes this bar. One night the bar gets robbed, which happened to be a drop night. Bob finds himself at the center of a robbery gone awry and entwined in an investigation that digs deep into the neighborhood's past where friends, families, and foes all work together to make a living - no matter the cost. There appears to be a moment of softness in the story when Bob rescues a beaten puppy that belongs to Nadia (Noomi Repace) and Nadia nurses the dog to health and insists Bob adopt the dog – which he does. The surprises begin – an evil guy Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts, a brilliant Belgian actor) raises threats, Detective Torres (John Ortiz) investigates the family, the bar, and the gang, and various people pop in and out of the story line, not the least of which is Marv's sister Dottie (Ann Dowd), and as a major surprise the end of the story uncovers secrets we have not expected.This is a thinking person's film: you must stay with all the subtle clues during all the machinations of the story.

Another reason to pick it up was the fact that this was the last flick of James Gandolfini. Knowing that it was a thriller I was ready for it.But once the flick was over I must say that I didn't like it at all. It's not the performances that were a letdown but the flick itself. A lot of talking going on and talking and almost no action. Maybe I'm the only one that didn't like this flick but a thriller or mobster flick without action isn't my thing.

It was good in the 70s, but most movies like that now seem terribly obsolete. Not so The Drop. You actually believe what happens in the film is real, the characters are well fleshed out, the acting great, the direction very good.The plot itself is not something I want to talk about, let me just say that people never really learn not to hurt dogs, do they? Tom Hardy plays again the sturdy, no bullshit, silent guy. Gandolfini, in his last movie before passing away, is the perfect old wannabe mobster. Rapace's role is nothing much, but at least she does well; I haven't seen her in anything decent since Girl with a Dragon Tattoo.Bottom line: the tired mobster genre rarely yields original and worthy films, but in this case it did. The Drop is more about the characters and the tense low key feel of potential violence. Reminded me of A History of Violence, a little bit, another decent gangster movie.",The Drop

'The Drop' Synopsis: Bob Saginowski finds himself at the center of a robbery gone awry and entwined in an investigation that digs deep into the neighborhood's past where friends, families, and foes all work together to make a living - no matter the cost.The only minus point in 'The Drop', is its slow-pacing. Its a complete slow-burn, it takes its own time to come to the actual point. But luckily, once it does, it picks up amazingly. However, a better pace wouldn't have hurt.Dennis Lehane's Screenplay is gritty & engrossing, more-so in the second-hour. Michaël R. Roskam's Direction is skilled. Cinematography is extra-ordinary, capturing the film's dark nature, perfectly. Editing is just about okay.Performance-Wise: Tom Hardy is in super form. The talented actor delivers a performance that's natural & realistic. Noomi Rapace is remarkable. Seriously, why hasn't she been Nominated for an Oscar? And lastly, The Late/Great James Gandolfini.

23,KineticSeoul,"Could have been better with a bit more tension and momentum, but still worth a watch",6,14 January 2016,"This film reminded me of the vibe I got from watching ""Harry Brown"". Which means it's mostly driven by the environment and the feel of it all. It's grisly, down and dirty film that takes place in Brooklyn and deals with tough or wannabe tough guys that talk street with their own philosophy on the street life in Brooklyn. This is James Gandolfini's last performance in a film before his passing and he plays his role really well and believable. Despite him not being in the main role in this, he is basically a side character. Despite most of the characters talking tough with some dark imagery, the build up is mediocre. The author that wrote this story also wrote, ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"" but this film can't compare with those film. Mainly because those films are just too super not-notch. However this is a alright film to sit through because of the vibe and the acting. Like I said this was a pretty darn good role for Gandolfini and Tom Hardy did a fine job as well. Despite Hardy not really being able to pull off the Brooklyn accent. However his character did service when it came to the ending. It isn't a groundbreaking twist but he played his role in a way where the ending didn't seem forced. I give this film a 6.8 and would have given it a higher score if it had a bit more tension or momentum going for it. Because this film did seem a bit dragged out during few scenes and sometimes came off as a slow burn movie although it's not quite a slow burn film. Overall this is worth one watch for the vibe and the acting, with a decent story.6.8/10",The Drop
24,sddavis63,This Does At Least Keep You Thinking That Something Is Going To Happen,2,12 September 2018,"""The Drop"" very effectively manages to present a story that feels ominous and threatening. From start to finish, there's an atmosphere that says that something big is going to happen. That it could maintain this atmosphere for almost two hours is impressive - because the truth is that nothing particularly interesting happens here. It stars James Gandolfini and Tom Hardy as cousins who run a bar in Brooklyn. But the bar is actually owned by a Chechen mob boss, and gets used every now and then as a night deposit place for mob money. The bar - ironically enough - gets robbed, some money gets stolen and the Chechen bosses are none too pleased. And Marv (Gandolfini) lives with his sister. And Bob (Hardy) gets a girlfriend (Noomi Rapace) and a pit bull puppy (I don't know the name of the puppy who played the puppy.) And her ex-boyfriend (Matthias Schoenaerts) is none too happy about the relationship. And there's a cop (John Ortiz) who goes to church with Bob and wonders why he doesn't take Communion. It's all very muddled and bizarre - at least I thought it was. It stays ominous and threatening - and then it fizzles out, without much really happening and with no real closure to any of it. In that sense it reminded me a little bit of the last scene of ""The Sopranos."" And yeah. There it is. That's why you should watch this movie!This is James Gandolfini's last piece of work before his sudden and unexpected death. That's actually why I finally decided to watch it. As a huge fan of ""The Sopranos"" and his work on that show, I'm sorry that he didn't go out on a better note - at least in my opinion. His character (with at least a distant relationship to the mob) is a familiar one. Hardy's character was more interesting in some ways - Bob was kind, gentle and yet still involved (even if at a distance) with this violent criminal activity. But I wasn't taken with Hardy. Maybe it was deliberate, but his performance didn't have much power to it. He seemed flat. Maybe that's the way the character was meant to be played, but it didn't capture me. Rocco (the dog) was cute - and he survived the movie. I always worry about cute dogs in a movie like this. The dialogue showed little imagination. At times this seemed to have been written in such a simple fashion that it seemed as if it was geared toward children. But it did always (from start to finish) feel as if something was going to happen. It always had that ominous and threatening atmosphere. Maintaining that in such a drag of a movie couldn't have been easy. It picks up a point for that. But in general, it really is a dud of a movie. (2/10)",The Drop
25,Hellmant,Tom Hardy is arguably the most talented male actor in film today!,9,22 September 2014,"'THE DROP': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Crime-thriller about a bartender who finds himself in trouble, with dangerous criminals, when the bar he works at, which is a 'money drop' for local gangsters, is robbed. It's based on the short story 'Animal Rescue' by Dennis Lehane (who also wrote such popular novels, turned movies, as 'MYSTIC RIVER', 'GONE BABY GONE' and 'SHUTTER ISLAND'). Lehane also wrote the screenplay and Michaël R. Roskam directed the movie. The film stars Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, John Ortiz, Matthias Schoenaerts (who also starred in Roskam's 2011 crime-drama flick 'BULLHEAD') and James Gandolfini (in his last film role). I found the movie to be really dark but extremely involving and suspenseful, at times, as well.Hardy plays Bob Saginowski; a Brooklyn bartender who works for his cousin Marv (Gandolfini) at a local tavern. The bar is involved in a money laundering scheme, run by local gangsters, and used as a 'money drop' for funneling dirty cash. When it's robbed, apparently by small time crooks, Bob and Marv find themselves under a lot of pressure (from the crime bosses) to find out who did it. At the same time Bob rescues a dog, that was beaten and left for dead in someone's trash can, and starts a relationship with the woman, Nadia (Rapace), who helps him. A detective (Ortiz), who goes to the same (closing) catholic church as Bob, is investigating the robbery.The movie, like everything based on Dennis Lehane's writings, is pretty dark. Hardy is outstanding once again; he's arguably the most talented male actor in film today. He's also the relatable heart of the film but even his character has a dark twist. All of the performances are good though and it's nice to see Gandolfini doing what he does best, one last time, as well. The directing is superb and the screenplay is, of course, brilliant. I think the movie is exactly what most viewers are expecting it to be, that are familiar with Lehane's work, and Hardy makes it even that much more memorable and classic!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Xz0GNkin4cw",The Drop

27,Robert_duder,Slow moving and mostly forgettable unfortunately,6,9 April 2015,"I don't think I saw much about The Drop but I liked the looks of the cast so I thought I would give it a chance. The film starts out very strong and you quickly become intrigued by Tom Hardy's character and what is happening. You are waiting to hit the climax where things really take off and you're expecting a complex and twisted thriller but...then it just sort of...drops off. Nothing ever really happens and it does get complex but it borders on non-nonsensical with characters that don't matter much and relationships that never go anywhere. I'm not even sure the direction the plot was trying to go in. I am also surprised at the score this has on IMDb because even from a critical standpoint, there wasn't a lot here to sink your teeth into. However, the performances were solid for the most part and the dark, gritty, brooding and violent streets make for a captivating feel to the setting. I think it had a lot of potential and the film makers had a lot of vision but somewhere along the lines it really fell apart.Tom Hardy leads the cast as Bob. Hardy gives a solid performance and leads the cast well. His performance is very reminiscent of Stallone in the original Rocky (and yes that is a compliment coming from me.) His character almost seems slow and yet streetwise. He may or may not have a dark past but none of that is ever really explored unfortunately. James Gandolfini is Cousin Marv in his very last performance. He and Hardy have good chemistry together but this is not a role that stretches his acting ability very far. Gandolfini has played this time and time again. His character also really ends up going nowhere. Noomi Rapace became an A-Lister and rightfully so playing Lisbeth in the Millennium trilogy. She has tried very hard to really make it big and this role won't help much. She is underdeveloped and feels almost pointless. Is she a romantic interest for Hardy? What is her purpose? She is rather unremarkable in this performance. The villains and thugs are all decent but one of the biggest problems with this film is that there is no stand out villainous role. Where is the gravitas performance to balance out the ""good guys"" or at least the ""anti-heroes""? Director Michael Roskam has very little experience yet and it really shows in this film. Yes it does a good job capturing the neighbourhood that Hardy exists in but the character development and scenes of interaction show a lot of inexperience. Dennis Lehane is a talented writer and he definitely knows dark and brooding and he did write the screenplay from his own novel but more experience behind the camera and maybe some more help tuning the script would have made this a much more effective crime thriller. They are aiming for something like The Town but it loses its footing later on and ends up being very forgettable and that's unfortunate. Still fans of Hardy and Gandolfini will find it at least watchable. 6/10",The Drop
28,ThomasDrufke,Don't Mess With Tom Hardy,7,28 January 2015,"Tom Hardy is easily one of the best actors working today, it's just a fact. The man transforms himself with every role he plays. This time he plays a New York bartender at a ""drop bar"". Basically whenever the mob needs a place to put their money for that night, they go to a certain bar. As you can imagine, with loads of money being given to one bar, chaos ensues.Hardy and Gandolfini share great chemistry on screen. It's really a shame that this is the first and last time they got to do a movie together. Both incredibly intense actors who are great at giving the subtlest of facial expressions that perfectly display their feelings on screen. Hardy comes across and a dog and a woman on the same night. He grows closer to both of them as the film progresses, but you don't get a true sense of what's behind either one of these story lines until the films end. I think one of the main problems that people have with the film is it's slow burn. I was engaged the entire time, but that probably has more to do with it's actors than the story that was going on.The pay off is worth the wait however, the last 15 minutes or so is one of the more intense endings I have seen this year. It's also very unexpected from where the characters have been the entire film. The performances are great all around and writing is beautiful.

29,secondtake,"Really solid and well told, well acted, well filmed...",7,5 April 2015,"The Drop (2014)A solid, somewhat slow but never tedious look inside some small time crooks who own a bar in the City. This one is a drop for payments in a booking racket, and the bar owner (James Gandolfini) sort of goes along because he has no choice. The bartender (Tom Hardy) is far more ambiguous, and he makes the movie click. Add Noomi Rapace whose small role fills in a big gap rather well and you have the core of the cast, all excellent.There is no attempt at the grandiose here, despite all the history and slightly exaggerated characters involved (mostly bad ones). And that's the beauty of the movie, which manages not just realism but a welcome tenderness amidst all the darkness and bad intentions. The one bright spot is, tragically, Gandolfini, who manages to be really funny even as he about to do terrible things. Hardy is just the opposite, showing a huge heart with utter sobriety even as he, too, is going to do terrible things.Whether this quite rises above the many movies that dive into this kind of world I don't know, but I thoroughly enjoyed it even when it seemed to get slow. It doesn't plod, but it has no urgency, either. There are some clichés that might have been avoided (the attitude of the bad guys) and some violence that seemed a bit in your face, but it balances out, too. Rapace is not given enough to do—this is a man's movie, another one —but she is tough and smart in necessary ways. Well filmed, smartly done, I'd give this a look.",The Drop

34,tomgillespie2002,Interesting concept made to feel ordinary by a contradictory final scene,6,28 April 2015,"Based on Dennis Lehane's short story Animal Rescue, and re-locating the action from the author's beloved Boston to the chilly streets of Brooklyn, The Drop is a disappointingly familiar film that shows a lot of promise in its build-up, but one that will most likely be best remembered for being the last screen performance of James Gandolfini. While the movie is hardly a fitting swansong to the actor's tragically short career, there is promise for future generations in the performance of lead Tom Hardy, who plays his deceptively dim bartender with an extremely subtle complexity, only hinting at the real man who lies beneath his shuffled walk and soft voice.Formerly respected criminal 'Cousin' Marv (Gandolfini) now spends his time behind the scenes at his eponymous bar, while his actual cousin Bob (Hardy) pours the drinks and keep the regulars in high spirits. The bar is a convenient locale for local gangsters to lay their 'drops' - small amounts of cash that are locked in a safe ready for whoever is destined to collect it. When the bar is robbed by masked gunmen, the efficient Chechen mobsters who run the operation are suspicious and demand that Marv and Bob locate their money. So far, so relatively formulaic - 2012's rather disappointing Killing Them Softly covered similar ground.The Drop is at its best when it hints at these characters' shady pasts and real character - traits these men may have embraced in their past, but have since been suppressed or subdued by new powers. The performances are magnificent all round, and special mention must go to Matthias Schoenaerts, who proves a truly menacing presence as Eric Deeds, the lonesome brute who comes into the picture after Bob finds a beaten puppy in the rubbish bin of Nadia (Noomi Rapace), Eric's former girlfriend. Bob and Nadia form a relationship, possibly out of mutual feelings of disenchantment or perhaps because they both simply care for the animal. Deeds is an intimidating and unnerving manipulator, and Schoenaerts is part of a trio of non- American actors playing American roles astonishingly well here - he's Belgian, Hardy is English, and Rapace is Swedish.The multiple plot threats naturally lead to a suitably bloody finale, where we learn what really makes these people tick and operate with such efficiency. But for all it's stylish direction and vibrant screenplay by Lehane himself, a disappointingly clichéd final scene betrays much of what came before. Up to this point, it is an interesting study of coming to terms with being the kind of man you wish you weren't. To offer salvation to a character who has just accepted this very thing is a simplistic and easy path to take, especially when the build-up is bolstered by an observant eye for detail and thick layer of cynicism, painting it's Winter greys broadly. This contradiction makes the film quite ordinary, when it could have been a compelling study of the insecurity of thugs and the circle of violence that surrounds them.",The Drop

When Bob rescues a pit-bull puppy from a trash can outside an apartment belonging to part-time waitress Nadia (Noomi Rapace), this blameless act sets in train actions which will end, of course, in violence. It is not an obvious wrong- place-wrong-time happenstance, more a butterfly-wingbeat moment that mysteriously changes Bob's whole life. But it is also a case of bringing about something that was waiting to happen anyway: an inescapable destiny. This is a movie riddled with guilt and fear. Overall a toned a slower paced thriller which comes full by its finale. As a rewatch 07/21/18' The Drop remains a great paced and suspenseful intriguing crime thriller which seemed to have went under the radar.

36,eddie_baggins,Hardy's turn elevates a ho-hum story,7,19 April 2015,"It's been quite some time since I've personally experienced a movie where the material has been elevated so much by a singular full bodied performance. In a tale that feels like it lives in a world we've been privy to countless times before, here being the working class neighbourhood of Brooklyn, The Drop becomes an unpredictable and intriguing package of pent up secrecy thanks to another stand out Tom Hardy performance.Masking his short statured, yet physically commanding appearance under a raft of dirty worn in ski jackets and turtlenecks, a Brooklyn accented Hardy delivers one of his most outwardly mild yet internally layered turns as the anything but simplistic barman Bob Saginowski. Bob is the heart and soul of the Drop and a creation by writer Dennis LeHane (in his first screenplay) that allows Hardy to develop an at first glance easy to read everyman that becomes something else entirely as the films narrative progresses. To give more away about Bob and his mindset would be a disservice to a film that utterly relies on Hardy's unmissable embodiment to survive as an entertaining film.Belgium born director Michael R. Roskam, in his first English language feature, does an amiable job behind the camera that sees him capture the colds of Brooklyn's streets in a fresh and interesting manner but The Drop doesn't feel like the event if could've been thanks to some pedestrian pacing and otherwise un-noteworthy acting turns. This was, as many know, James Gandolfini's last acting turn and sadly it's not much of a turn, in what really is a more subdued version of his Tony Soprano character, while Sweden's Noomi Rapace continues her long line of ill-informed Hollywood roles that in my mind has seen her become one of the most frustrating and irritating on screen leading ladies in some time. Her Nadia is an unlikeable and deterring presence on the film while fellow European recruit Matthias Schoenaerts sadly doesn't fare much better, it is however nice to see Australian expat and Animal Kingdom breakout star James Frecheville in a small but important role. Where the Drop finds an element to match Hardy's standing is in some of its finely crafted dialogue and plot developments, that for anyone familiar with Lehane's work will realise are perfectly suited to his narrative tics, even though some twee elements such as Rocco the dog feel slightly misjudged.As a fan of cinema for as many years as I'd care to remember, I must admit to being quite assured of my picking up of characters and what to expect from their behaviour and story so it's with great joy that I can talk about the Drop being a film that blindsided me for the better part of its runtime and that is right down to the fact that once more I along with many others, am lucky enough to have bared witness to another expertly crafted Tom Hardy turn. Hardy is an actor that works on another level entirely to those that work alongside him and The Drop is elevated from its pedestrian like roots to something much more memorable thanks to his Bob Saginowski, the man that no one sees coming.3 and a half casual limb wrappings out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The Drop
37,filipemanuelneto,A regular movie where the interpretations are the biggest positive surprise.,5,2 May 2017,"This movie revolves around a bar where organized crime (apparently Russian mobsters) often collects illicit proceeds. But the bar is robbed and the crime money is stolen and Bob, one of the bar managers, has the task of getting the money back. At the same time, a subplot is developed involving this character, a Russian veterinarian named Nadia, a dog found in the trash and a dangerous bandit, Eric Deeds. The film blends two stories connected by the central character and the script still has a certain scent of gangster movie. However, it is not a particularly interesting story.What gives strength to this film is the strong cast and their positive interpretations. James Gandolfini gave life to Marv, a man embittered by the loss of his bar. The actor managed to give his character a powerful and psychologically rich personality. It was with this movie that he said goodbye to the big screen, dying shortly after. Tom Hardy is equally to be congratulated. His character is the most powerful and psychological of the film, since he spends all his time avoiding trouble but ends up showing his anger at the end. He seems like a pretty normal guy to some extent, and the actor does it all in a very convincing way. Matthias Schoenaerts is one of the biggest villains and gave life to a mobster who immediately makes us believe in being capable of the worst things.

Not me, not the unmotivated police as we can see and not the absent politic authorities that seems to be totally mute concerning all those barbaric murders that happens daily in the neighborhood! I really wonder what was Noomi's motivation to act in it except to be paired again with Hardy. As usual, Noomi does an amazing job with a lot of mannerism, reactions and she transforms a rather transparent character into someone for which we care. I can't the same for her partners who act painfully slowly.

39,leonblackwood,Could have been better! 5/10,5,3 May 2015,"Review: After such a big build up throughout the movie, I was quite disappointed with the outcome. I was expecting big shootouts and loads of violence but it turned out to be a drama about ex-con, trying to go straight. All of the characters are coming from a shady background and they're trying to make the best out of what they have. Bob (Tom Hardy) and his cousin Marv (James Gandolfini) run a bar in New York which is used to launder money for mobsters. When the bar gets robbed, the gangsters take matters into there own hands to try and find out who stole there cash. They hold the two bar owners responsible for the stolen money and they pressure them to get there money back. While all of this is going on, Bob finds a dog in a trash can outside a girls house and he takes the dog in and becomes friends with the girl. I personally found the movie quite slow and dull. Tom Hardy's character seemed a bit dumb witted, but Hardy played it well. I don't know why the director made Hardy play the character like that, because there was obviously more to his persona which was interesting. The brief moment when he snaps, did bring some light to the film but it doesn't last long. Anyway, I was quite disappointed with the movie because it had a great cast and a decent storyline. It just seemed a bit one toned and it takes too long for something to happen. Average!Round-Up: This is one of the last movies that James Gandolfini made in his career and it's a shame that he didn't go out with a bang. After the massive Sopranos series and great performances in The Mexican, Killing Them Softly and Violet & Daisy, he has proved to be a great actor who will be sadly missed. Tom Hardy can't seem to do anything wrong since his fantastic performance in Bronson. He did star in some big movies at the beginning of his career, like the Band of Brothers, which was his first big screen project, Black Hawk Down,  Star Trek: Nemesis, Layercake and RocknRolla but he really shot to fame after Bronson and Inception. With Splinter Cell, Rocketman and the new Mad Max franchise in the pipeline, there really is no turning back for this 37 year old, London born actor. Noomi Rapace shot to fame after the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo franchise and she has starred in some big movies like Prometheus, Sherlock Holmes and the upcoming Child 44, which also stars Tom Hardy. She also has another Prometheus movie coming out next year so her box office success is looking up. With such great actors, the director really should have done a better job with this film.

When even scenes with Tom Hardy as the central focus are putting you to sleep you know you have a problem. Hardy plays a ""simple"" character, for lack of a better term, and pulls it off surprisingly well. He really is a fantastic actor it has to be said and I have no doubts an Oscar nomination is realistic in the near future. That's why it's a shame performances like this will almost go to waste because the script wasn't strong enough to keep people interested.The characters are a big issue. With James Gandolfini (in his final role) they tried to give him a 'Tony Soprano' like role, but to pull that off takes fantastic writing. 'The Sopranos' was good enough to do it, 'The Drop' was not. Then to go with the dull characters comes scene after scene of what feels like endless talk about simply whatever's going on at that particular moment. Any rare moments of action are predictable and poorly executed by director Michaël R. Roskam. Die hard Hardy fans may be able to enjoy this despite its flaws, but otherwise give it a miss.",The Drop
41,BeneCumb,"Far above average, thanks to great performances in particular",7,6 January 2015,"The movie in question has 3 great performances: James Gandolfini (as Cousin Marv; his final movie, RIP!), Noomi Rapace (as Nadia), and - particularly - Tom Hardy (as Bob Saginowski) whose character and role presentation is so different from the ones he is known of. The plot, however, in spite of some witty angles and giggling moments (well, the author is solid), is tardy and arid at times, especially seen through scenes with subordinate characters such as the Chechen mobsters and Eric Deeds. I can't say the story becomes boring, but as we do with crime drama here, the narration is too floating and commonplace, the characters do not change even in the course of dramatic events. Thus, too static even to me, even if I don't find that a proper crime drama should be based on constant chases, shootings and explosions. But still worth watching due to the performances mentioned above.",The Drop
42,meeza,Drop in on this one!,8,29 December 2014,"I don't want to drop the ball in this review, so I promise I will not incorporate a plethora of puns. Who am I kidding? You know I drop puns like a wild man. Anyways, time to get into the Drop program. The crime caper ""The Drop"" was an insightful, unpredictable movie proficiently directed by Michael R. Roskam and ""writefully"" penned by acclaimed screenwriter Dennis Lehane. The backdrop of ""The Drop"" is a New York bar called ""Cousin Marv's"" that is utilized for money drops for the mafia. Tom Hardy stars as Bob, the bar's mild-mannered bartender who gets hounded by his new dog's former owner to return his dog back to him. Bob is cousin to Bar Manager Marv (played by the late, great James Gandolfini), who used to own the bar a decade ago but now its proprietors are Russian thugs; you could say that Uncle Marv's Bar turned into The Russia House. I told you there were puns! Please don't drop me now! Also, dropping by to this one is the former girl with the dragon tattoo Noomi Rapace as Nadia; who takes a strange liking to Bob, but also gets caught up in the crossfire of the film's developments. Hardy keeps on proving that he is one of the best actors of today that not many have heard of with yet another great performance, here as Bob. It is heartbreaking to see Gandolfini and know that he is no longer with us; he delivered a very worthy performance as Cousin Marv, which sadly was his last performance. Rapace was not so sharp in her work as Nadia, but did not detract that much from the movie's effectiveness. What enamored me the most of ""The Drop"" was its unpredictability, which gravitated me to the film's narrative. ""The Drop"" moves a bit slow at times (call it a slow drop), but I would still recommend to drop your plans for today, and reach for ""The Drop"". **** Good",The Drop
43,alindsay-al,A good crime film,7,18 September 2015,"With this being James gandolfinis last ever performance I was interested in seeing the drop. The premise of this film sees a couple of cousins run a drop bar for the mafia when a robbery happens it leads to one problem after another. Yom hardy is one of the best actors in Hollywood and he is great in this film. It's a very understated performance but you see the emotion and pain in his character and he is a fascinating character. James gandolfini is fantastic in this film with his performance. His facial expressions sells his performance and you feel the pain in his character. Noomi rapace is good in this film as Hardy's love interest and she added to allot to the film and Hardy's character. The villains were pretty good and creepy too even if they were a bit underdeveloped. The story had some good mystery to it and a good romance. However, there are allot of turns that you don't really care about and your wondering what's going on in the film. The script has some good dramatic moments and dialogue. But sometimes it becomes hard to understand and there is no humour at all. The style is very gritty and dark which really works. But the pacing of the film is a bit off and can make it feel a bit too long. Overall this is is a good film that if you like gangster films you will probably enjoy.",The Drop
44,estebangonzalez10,Tom Hardy delivers in this crime thriller,8,27 February 2015,"""There are some sins that you commit that you can't come back from, you know, no matter how hard you try. You just can't.""The Drop is my kind of film and that is why I am able to look past the predictability of the story and simply enjoy the movie for what it is: a low level gangster film with an outstanding cast. If you are the kind of person who prefers spectacular car chases and heavy shooting in thrillers than The Drop definitely isn't for you because it is a slow burner that requires patience from the viewers. It is more interested in establishing who these characters are and setting the atmosphere and tone of the movie than in focusing on the action scenes. It doesn't discard the banality of these gangsters day to day life so at times the viewer might feel that it is an ordinary and boring film, but if you stick with the story the ending definitely pays off. I enjoyed that slow buildup and didn't mind it at all because I loved how the story focused on Tom Hardy's character arc and was drawn to his performance. The Drop is based on Dennis Lehane's short story, Animal Rescue, and the screenplay was also adapted by him so I had confidence in the story that was being told. Lehane has written some of my favorite crime thrillers (Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River) so I knew he was going to deliver once again. It might just be another crime thriller that doesn't stand out from other films in the genre, but if you are a fan of these stories you will have a great time with The Drop. The Drop is directed by Michael Roskam and despite not being as groundbreaking as his Oscar nominated Belgian film, Bullhead, it is still one of the best thrillers of the year thanks to the wonderful performances from the cast and the attention to details of the Brooklyn scene. In The Drop Tom Hardy stars as a lonely bartender named Bob. Along with his cousin Marv (James Gandolfini) they run things at a local bar as a cover for dangerous Chechen gangsters. This is just one of the many bars the Chechens use as a cover to drop off all the money from the night's criminal activities in one place. There are some strong supporting performances from John Ortiz who plays a detective investigating a robbery that takes place in Marv's bar, Noomi Rapace who thanks to the help of an abandoned puppy warms up to Bob's lonely persona, and Matthias Schoenaerts a low life criminal trying to con Bob using the puppy. As you can tell the puppy plays an important role in this film and there is something symbolic about its presence in the way it changes Bob's social life. It's the cutest puppy I've seen on film this year.The greatest thing about The Drop is without a doubt Tom Hardy's lead performance. Hardy is establishing himself as my favorite actor. He is such a versatile actor and in this film he reminded me a lot Gosling's character in Drive. He is sort of retracted and silent, but he conveys so much without saying anything. His character arc is what drives this film. Another reason to watch The Drop is that it's James Gandolfini's final performance. He passed away a month after having finished shooting this film. We've seen him play this role many times in the past, but he does it so well that I found it a fitting farewell. Schoenaerts is excellent and Rapace plays these dark roles to perfection. John Ortiz also has some interesting scenes and I was glad to see Ann Dowd have a small role as well. I wish she had more screen time. The Drop is worth watching for the cast alone, but it also has a smart screenplay and an interesting atmospheric tone. It's short of being a masterpiece, but it still is a wonderful film. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Drop
45,jimbo-53-186511,"The Drop is all the D's - Dreary, Dismal, Dull, Depressing & Disappointing",1,7 October 2015,"The Drop is based on the short story 'Animal Rescue' which was written by Dennis Lehane - Lehane was also responsible for the screenplay for this film. All I can say is if the book is anything like this mess of a film then I can safely say that I'll be steering well clear of it.The plot line here is clichéd and is something that we're pretty much all familiar with by now. Personally, I have no problem with a familiar storyline, but in order for it to work it needs to have several key ingredients all of which are severely lacking in this film...Lehane has clearly gone for a 'slow-burn' approach to the narrative in this film which is fine as long as you give your audience something to care about. The simple truth of the matter here is that the characters were one-dimensional and uninteresting, the storyline is vague and meandering and rather nonsensical. The sub-plot involving Hardy's character and the thug wanting his dog back was utterly ridiculous and took up far too much of the story (such as it was). We also have the clichéd detective here who does absolute no detective work and merely shows up randomly whenever the story dictates (as opposed to showing him actually investigating anything). The stupidity in this film is evident when we see Gandolfini's character run a guy over and then drive away in a different car thus leaving the dead body and the car he used to commit the crime at the crime scene??? I can suspend some disbelief, but surely even those with a similar IQ to Beavis & Butthead would know that this is a dumb idea.The performances are OK here, but again to saddle the likes of Tom Hardy and the late James Gandolfini with such characterless persona's is just a waste of their talents. The turn of events at the end are hardly surprising, but to be honest about 20 minutes from the end I'd pretty much given up on this film and was just waiting for the credits to roll.The Drop is a failure from every angle; it isn't entertaining, it lacks intensity, it has no interesting characters, the story was at best boring and at worst idiotic.

46,r96sk,Perhaps I missed something?,4,29 April 2020,"It seems many will disagree, but I found 'The Drop' incredibly uninspiring.I don't look at ratings/reviews of films until after I watch them, to allow myself to form my own opinion. So you can imagine my surprise at seeing this rated fairly highly across many platforms. I respect that, but for me this is terrible.First of all, I must say this, I love Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini - two superb actors. That's where the good for this film ends. Neither Hardy or Gandolfini give their best here, though are not helped by the poor script and lacklustre premise.You can tell they were going for something smart, like that mechanic they use for the drops inside the bar - they show it once at the beginning, then a few times near the conclusion as if it's something mind-blowing.I realised at one point I was 1hr 15mins or so in and was shocked as nothing had happened. To me, this is the definition of a plodding storyline. They build and build without it leading to anything, even throwing in an entirely predictable love quarrel.Back to the onscreen people, Hardy's accent bothered me too. I'm not normally one to critique accents, I even like Don Cheadle's 'effort' in the 'Ocean's' trilogy for example. It felt so forced. The other cast members are entirely forgettable, also.I think the reason I'm so frustrated by this is the fact it has two great leads, with an initial plot that could be enthralling. Instead, it's an absolute snoozefest. Perhaps I missed something?",The Drop
47,juneebuggy,"Money changes hands all night long, it's just not the kind you can deposit in a bank.",8,20 January 2017,"I really enjoyed this, its a bit of a slow burn for a crime-drama, taking a while to unfold as we get to know our characters and what they're really up to. Tom Hardy is excellent, playing the unassuming but progressively layered Bob, who... as he states... ""just tends bar"" for his cousin Marv in Brooklyn. James Gandolfini (in his final role) as Marv gives a memorable performance. I found his character very sad.The two of them easily carry this film which isn't as innocent as it seems. Bob and Marv are working an illegal scheme funnelling cash to local gangsters through money drops. A bar the bosses choose at random each night to be the safe for an entire city as money is always changing hands, it's just not the kind you can deposit in a bank.Marv had previously gambled his bar away to the Chechen mobsters (bad guys) and is now trapped working for them, while still trying to prove he's a tough guy in the neighbourhood. As events unfold Bob befriends a girl with a nasty ex, falls in love with a dog, gets entwined in a police investigation digging into the neighbourhood's past and everyone gets caught in a robbery gone wrong.This is worth a watch for Tom Hardy, Gandolfini's last role and a clever story that's not reliant on shootouts or special effects people do however get run over, shot point blank, and there are bags of cash and body parts. 12/4/16",The Drop
48,myriamlenys,"Fine, atmospheric crime movie",8,8 February 2020,"The movie tells a tale about a bar set in a tough neighbourhood, where respectable hard-working people meet and mingle with parasites, lunatics or criminals, often without realising it.

The story being told is gritty, violent and compelling, with a number of beautifully unexpected twists and turns.The acting too is exceptional, with many remarkable performances. My own compatriot Matthias Schoenaerts, for instance, does very well as a not-too-bright, not-too-sane bully who is as obnoxious and as persistent as a sewer rat.In its own way ""The Drop"" highlights the plight of dog breeds such as pitbulls, bulldogs, bull-and-terrier mixes, and so on. Dogs, when bred and raised with respect, are magnificent friends, but sadly not everyone is looking for a magnificent friend : there are people in this world who go out of their way in order to raise truly dangerous breeds or truly dangerous dogs. This results in harrowing cases of animal abuse ; this also results in gruesome attacks on innocent victims, which causes ever larger circles of fear, prejudice and paranoia. In the movie, our barman hero/anti-hero discovers a mistreated pitbull puppy thrown in with the garbage.

49,aharmas,"Everyone is Excellent, and Hardy Soars",9,20 October 2014,"Here is a film that shows how incredible good acting can be. Tom Hardy has proved himself a performer who can show intensity no matter what the role is. In ""The Drop"" there is a different Hardy, a simmering performance where we can't really predict where his source of strength comes from. He's just a steady force, someone who appears willing to listen, to offer his support, and who has a big heart, too.Hardy works as a bartender in a small neighborhood that might be more than meets the eye. There is a variety of deals going on, and we have to be careful not to miss the not-so-subtle maneuvers and deals. There is always an element of surprise, with some unexpected turns coming. We have a mistreated animal, a possible love match for Hardy's character, and a man who continues to show up, with a series of threats. The story is interesting because it's a series of riddles, mysteries, and developments which might lead to quite an ending.Our bartender leads a very simple life. He goes to work, puts up with an obnoxious boss, the typical annoyance from his customers, and one day, he becomes the new owner of a pet that might have been abused by its previous owner. This establishes a connection with a girl who is hesitant to establish new ties, but who also finds herself attracted to our mysterious bartender. What makes his attitude puzzling is how nothing appears to upset him. He carries on, working, listening, observing others, and he finds himself in the middle of a potential set up. He is the picture of simplicity, yet he's very complex in his own particular way. He lives, watches, and learns, and what he discovers doesn't always please him.Gandolfini is a strong force, a man resenting how his reputation has lost some of its luster. He has come up with a scheme that can give everything he wants and he thinks he needs. Unfortunately, there are other players in the picture, which might lead to a few problems for everyone involved.It's difficult to reveal some of this treat of a screenplay. It shows the possibilities when one expects nothing more than a thriller. This is a study in character development, and there is power in silence, in looks, in normal relationships. There is always another side to everyone, something in the past, or something in the present, a chance to change, to break free, or remain quiet. Quiet is different here, and it's different and powerful, intelligent and entertaining, and with a lead like Hardy, a treat to all.",The Drop

But interestingly it focuses on the drop bar scene, which no movie had ever done before. The story builds nicely on the obviously looking part of the heist and the back-stabbing, supposedly common among the criminals and mafia. The tie-in of the dog to the central story is quite nice, although it's very much predictable since the movie leaks the moment where it shows a first person shot of someone watching at Bob and Nadia when they found the dog. The movie builds the conflict complications nicely all throughout the duration. But the overall story gets very much predictable since at about half way into it. The ending conflict and resolution prove to be quite insufficient for us the viewers, even though it's very much efficient story-wise. Tom Hardy did a decent job in playing the hidden strongman. Noomi Rapace nicely keeps her suspicious expressions fairly all over the movie. James Gandolfini adds the authentic mafia crime taste to this movie.",The Drop

The closest equivalent I can think of here is 2013's ""Killing Them Softly"", but Brad Pitt's portrayal of Cogan and the Runyon-esque feel of the plot and dialog make that movie considerably less grim than this gem. But you should see them both and make your own decisions as to which one is better or more effective. Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini really sell this one.

Apparently it was based off a short story, but I thought the story would've been much better had the leads actually confronted in the end - alas Gandolfini character's demise is handled too briskly. Anyway, Tom Hardy turns in a performance on par to the level of his countryman Christian Bale earlier in the year in a different movie American Hustle. Hardy's performance is outstanding - he nails the Eastern US accent. Younger Noomi Rapace reprises a similar role she had in ""Dead Man Down"" satisfactorily.

They're Boston crime dramas in a mildly tempered thriller vein with a healthy amount of double crosses and haunted pasts. At the very least, the bleak but slick mood of his films - Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island and now The Drop - always match the tone of the narrative. They're cinematic even if they still retain the scent of their novels. And The Drop is setup very well, almost deceptively well as the rest of the film struggles to meet the potential. Regardless, this is a familiar meat and recipe. Unfortunately the longer it goes on, the more, Lehane proves he has few flavours to his ingredients. Tom Hardy has little to do. Too often does the film offer the same wistful expression from him. This isn't exactly Drive, there isn't enough internalized development to work on. I'm sure Roskam works better with Matthias Schoenaerts in Bullhead, but here he's false and the film is only as good as he is from the time he appears on screen. Gandolfini however is excellent in his final performance giving the gruff tenderness he's known for. It's an engaging film but falls short.7/10",The Drop

More untypically, however, ""The Drop"" also features a badly abused dog and a focus on its characters that adds enormously to the richness and authenticity of Denis Lehane's fine screenplay which is based on his 2009 short story ""Animal Rescue"".In a working-class neighbourhood of Brooklyn, ""Cousin Marv's"" is a seedy bar that's occasionally used as a ""drop"" for the proceeds of the vicinity's criminal and gambling activities. Substantial amounts of cash are deposited by a variety of individuals and then held for later collection by a member of the Chechen mob that rules the area. The bar's run by Marv (James Gandolfini) and his cousin Bob (Tom Hardy) who's the regular bartender.One night, Marv becomes irritated when some of the bar's customers raise a toast to a local guy called Richie Whelan who was murdered 10 years earlier and later, on his way home, Bob sees a bleeding and very distressed-looking pit-bull puppy in a bin outside the house of one of his neighbours. Nadia (Noomi Rapace) is surprised and suspicious at first to find Bob looking into her bin but later helps him to nurse the dog back to health.Bob, whose relationship with Nadia develops slowly and quietly, is unassuming, hard-working and seems perfectly content to take his orders from the more forceful Marv who used to own the bar until the Chechens took it over some years ago. Bob's rather routine lifestyle suddenly changes when the bar's robbed one night by a couple of masked men who threaten Bob and Marv at gunpoint and make off with $5,000. The Chechens hold Bob and Marv responsible for retrieving the money and are very threatening about what will happen if they don't succeed. To make matters worse, Bob also gets stalked by a menacing and mentally unstable man called Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts) who claims to be the pit-bull's owner and a local detective who starts asking questions about the Richie Whelan murder. Bob copes stoically with everything that happens and the way in which his story reaches its denouement is both fascinating and shocking.The most striking thing about this movie is Tom Hardy's wonderfully measured performance which conveys so perfectly the strength, intensity and loneliness of Bob who's consistently underestimated because of his passive nature. The late James Gandolfini (in his last big-screen appearance), also excels as Marv who's become bitter and resentful due to the loss of his bar, his status and the financial stability that he once enjoyed. Among the strong supporting cast, Mattias Schoenaerts stands out as the vicious psychopath Eric Deeds, who's Nadia's ex-boyfriend and in the opinion of most people, Richie Whelan's killer.""The Drop"" has a moody atmosphere that's enhanced by most of the action taking place in low-light or night-time situations and the subtle build-up of the tension that becomes such a strong feature of the film is brilliantly paced and highly effective. With its modest budget and lack of hype, it would be easy for those who haven't seen this movie to have low expectations of it but those who have seen it will know that underestimating Bob or ""The Drop"" would be a big mistake.",The Drop

61,brchthethird,A slow-building character piece with fine performances,8,16 July 2015,"THE DROP is a film that I was aware of last year, but that I was still unable to see in theaters. And, to be honest, this isn't the type of film that stays in theaters for very long anyway. It's a slow-building, adult drama that focuses on character and story rather than inundating you with a lot of action and special effects, i.e., it's the perfect example of an indie movie. I don't really want to get into very much of the plot, because to do so would take away from the experience of seeing it for yourself. Basically, Bob (Tom Hardy) is a bartender at Cousin Marv's Bar, and Marv is played by James Gandolfini in one of, if not, his last screen performances. The bar serves as what's called a ""drop bar"" (hence, the title) where mafia and mob types temporarily stash their dirty money. One night they're held up at gunpoint and the people who own the bar keep pressuring them to find out who did it and get their money back. Also, Bob finds a beaten up pit-bull and starts taking care of him. That's the setup. What follows isn't really profound, nor does it look at the deeper meaning of anything. It's just a good story about a quiet man who stands up for the weak. Noomi Rapace was also in the cast, and is the only other actor I was familiar with, but everyone turned in a great performance. From a technical standpoint, like the story, everything was rather restrained, letting the drama unfold naturally and never forcing any feeling or perspective on the viewer. The score also helped a great deal, keeping the story flowing and assisting in building tension when necessary. If there's anything to say to the film's detriment, it's that it's almost TOO calm and composed. But still, it was such a great story that I didn't mind much. People with short attention spans will probably find this a bit slow and boring, but the patient will be rewarded. I suppose the closest comparison would be with KILLING THEM SOFTLY, in the way it favors drama over thrills, and the sparing but judicious use of violence. If you're looking for a crime drama that has good characters and story, and heart, THE DROP wouldn't be a bad choice.",The Drop

That makes it a temptation for a robbery, by gunsels stupid enough to take on the Chechnya mafia. But the swaggering characters are also dropped, whether the hapless stooge robbers, the looney sadist Eric Deeds or quiet Cousin Marv, whose unwise ambitions would restore him to his delusions of lost significance. All the fallen bear their scars, though dog Rocco recovers more fully than the so human Nadia. When he's dropped Deeds learns his street cred was based on Bob's deed not his.2.

In contrast to the fallen, Nadia and Rocco rise from their falls and find redemption, new lives, thanks to the good nature of the — wholly unprepossessing — Bob, whom as the detective finally notes, nobody sees coming. The simplest character proves the most effective, even if he is a faithful Catholic who feels unworthy of communion. He brings others salvation because he expects none himself. The pit bull can survive his abuse — and his breed's reputation — if someone gives him the chance. Slow Bob does. Bob Saganowski is like a Charles (Buchinski) Bronson hero — under sedation.3. The opening shot shows the city night reflected in a sidewalk pool. As in Taxi Driver, the image is infernal, providing a reverse view of normalcy. We get similar reversals from the bottom of the barrel collecting the illicit money and from shots of the nefarious lives. The drama reveals the underbelly of our daylight lives.4. As in that Hell some characters represent Death in Life, the living dead. Literally, Marv's dad is in an expensive home wired for a vegetable survival. Figuratively, Marv himself feels dead because his life lacks the importance and self-respect he thinks he used to have. In trying to recover his illusory past he burns whatever future he might have had. Nadia retreats from the brutality of her earlier relationship into a wary detachment. She won't let Bob into her yard till she's sent photos of his driver's license to four friends. As if she has any. Her real danger enters and holds without difficulty. As Cousin Marv is James Gandolfini's valedictory role there's also the counterpoint: Life in Death. The film marks the afterlife of Gandolfini's persona. His Soprano image enlivens Bob's recollection of the crew he and Marv had as young men and Marv's memories of power:""I had something once. I was respected. I was FEARED."" (Gandolfini provided a similar frisson of memory in the Broadway production of Yasmina Reza's God of Carnage.) Though we don't know Tony's fate we're shown one possibility when we see Marv's. Gandolfini is gone but his persona has been freed. With a marvellous script by Dennis Lehane and excellent performances, this is a truly poetic tour of those mean streets down which a man must go. Especially in the Chechins' Brooklyn.",The Drop
63,thekarmicnomad,Gangster life without the glitz,8,6 March 2021,"So we know from the start that a robbery is going to go down - we just don't know where or by who.This film is filled with interesting, yet not very bright characters who are preoccupied with how they feel the world should be rather than how it is.
Our lead man, Bob, is a simple, earthy kind of guy: a man of few words trying to do the right thing in a dangerous world.This film is mostly about the characters - don't expect a devious heist, the characters just aren't smart or ambitious enough for that.Having grounded characters makes the film feel very tense and realistic.
This movie looks a bit beige on paper but this is actually its strength - I got really invested in the characters and when they got scared so did I.

64,adamscastlevania2,The final act of an all-time great performer,7,19 November 2014,"(66%) An apt farewell to the great James Gandolfini in a role that fits the very talented actor like a well tailored glove, and anyone with at least some fondness and admiration should find a fair degree to enjoy here. Along-side the great man is the ever impressive Tom Hardy playing a character somewhat reminiscent to Rocky Balboa, with his good heart, chequered past, devotion to dogs, and even the relationship with Moomi Rapace has a similar feel to the one heavily featured in the Rocky movies. The way this focuses on characters that aren't really what one would call gangsters and yet they're not really all that straight and narrow either making for a somewhat unique angle, and that's considering the fact that the movie barely breaks any new ground. The plot is more intriguing than exciting, and the pacing does grind to a near halt at a few times, but I never found it dull, and a couple of scenes are surprisingly heartwarmingly sweet. All-in-all a good addition to crime cinema that won't be ranked among the best but is still a worthy watch for the cast alone.",The Drop
65,cultfilmfan,The Drop,9,29 September 2014,"Much like the other day's viewing of A Walk Among the Tombstones, The Drop was for me, another film that came out of nowhere and I really did not end up knowing much about the film before I went into the theatre to see it, but came out loving it and finding it one of the strongest films of this year. I think one thing that made me curious as to whether, or not I would like the film was the whole ""crime"" type of film that the film is labelled as. There are certainly some terrific crime movies out there, but as I said in my review of A Walk Among the Tombstones, that this is another genre of film, where you have some great films in the genre and every film after that just has to be a repeat carbon copy of the original said film and it just gets really formulated and after you have seen one you have seen them all. Of course this is an all around very broad statement and there are certainly exceptions to the rule, but this is why I normally avoid these type of films. As, I was saying earlier, The Drop really took me by surprise. I would not even necessarily bill it as a crime film. Yes, it has elements of that in there, but there is so much more to this film than that. Take the main character of the film, Bob, brilliantly played by Tom Hardy. This is a character who seems like your average kind of guy, who is nice, maybe a little shy at times and just has a good outlook on things. Without giving away anything, Bob is the type of character that we can relate and identify with because he is your average everyday working man, but we also see that beneath his kind and sometimes shy and vulnerable exterior, Bob actually has a lot more on the ball, and more to life than we may think. His character and the friendship he strikes up with Noomi Rapace's Nadia, is one of the film's highlights for me as well and the characters bond together well, even though there is much more to both of these characters than what meets the eye and we see them as they both struggle, but come to terms with the various difficulties and situations that they are going through in their lives throughout the course of this film. One of the strongest aspects of this film is the well written characters and the brilliant portrayals of the actors playing them. All the acting here feels so natural and authentic that we really feel we know these characters, or now, or perhaps in the past have known characters just like them because they are written as everyday human beings with struggles and weaknesses, but also things that drive them and make them strong, which is a really driving force behind these characters and the film as well. The film is stark and bitter looking taking place during a cold and bleak winter and again set against an urban backdrop which suit's the film perfectly. This is not a flashy big budget Hollywood film. It's smaller in it's scale and works all the more better because of that. A big glamorous production, as I always say, would not have worked here, but taken away all the natural charm and gritty realism that works so well for this film. The film had a terrific pace to it and again was one of those films that captured my interest early on already and because of the tight direction and excellent screenplay and performances it carried the film all the way through to a satisfying and strong ending and film in general. At times when I thought the film was going to go in a certain direction and become one of your more procedural films with police, gangs and all that we normally find in your typical ""crime films"", this film avoided it and instead of formulated clichés, it actually gave us a real story about real people and situations that were just as, or in my case, more interesting than had it gone the other route I mentioned earlier. Unfortunately there was not a lot of people at the screening I went to for The Drop, which I think is a real shame when you have a film of this calibre out there and nobody is going to see it. If you love films that are big on character development as well as excellent writing, directing and acting, then The Drop should be for you as well. Even for those who normally get into the typical crime films. Those viewers should like The Drop, as well, but here they have even more of an offering than your usual film, so you are getting an even better film than you expect and for your money's worth. Check out The Drop, while it is still in theatres around you. It is one of 2014's strongest films and also one of it's best.",The Drop
66,t-dooley-69-386916,Great Performances in a compelling crime drama,9,2 May 2015,"With actors like Tom Hardy and the late James Gandolfini you really should not go wrong and director Michaël R. Roskam, who we can thank for the excellent 'Bullhead', actually doesn't really put a foot wrong. The story is simple one Bob (Hardy) is a cousin to 'Cousin Marv' (Gandolfini) and he works for him too at his bar. This is a bar Marv used to own but has somehow managed to lose it to some not so nice Chechnyan gangster types.Part of the pubs duties is to act as a 'drop' for dirty money. Then the bar gets hit and all of a sudden things aren't all sweetness and light as someone is going to pay. Couple this with a story of a stray dog and Bob's unwitting entanglement of the heart and we have enough in the mix to keep most fans happy.There are excellent performances here from everyone including Naomi Rapace – there is some visceral violence and some earthy language but this is a solid film and also shows Gandolfini as the true talent he was – he is, as ever, more than able to steal the scenes he is in and cinema will be lesser without him. This is a film I took a while to see but then better things do often take their time.",The Drop

There's nothing bad that can be said about the performance of the three leads - Rapace, Hardy and Gandolfini. I was scratching my head throughout the movie to find out what part of Brooklyn the story was set in because I couldn't read any street signs, so I'm guessing Bensonhurst? Dyker Heights? Bay Ridge? Regardless, it was a nice thriller and worth seeing.",The Drop
68,bryank-04844,'The Drop' is a fine addition to the mafia drama genre.,7,12 August 2015,"I love a good mafia drama. There is just something so thrilling and cool about seeing the seedy underbelly of a city and the back door games and scams that the mob plays out. From 'Goodfellas' to 'The Departed', the characters are so well though out and detailed that you can spend over three hours with them and feel like only five minutes have gone by. You could say that a lot of these iconic characters are larger than life itself, which is true, given their past historical accounts of what they did to earn money and gain power. But that is where Michael R. Roskam's adaptation of Dennis Lehane's short story, formally called 'Animal Rescue', but now called 'The Drop' differs.This movie is not in the possession of Roskam's camera or Lehane excellent screenplay here. Nor is it in the late legendary hands of James Gandolfini. No, this movie is Tom Hardy's film one-hundred percent, and he owns every second of this film with his powerful yet very vulnerable performance. Hardy has taken this mafia story down a different path than usual, despite you seeing the same plot many times before. But somehow here, it feels very fresh and different. I have no doubt Roskam has a bright future ahead of himself.Hardy plays Bob the bartender who tends bar for his cousin Marv (Gandolfini). Marv's sports bar was taken over by some Chechen mobsters several years ago, and now Marv is forced to just run the day-to-day operations rather than own the joint. The Chechen mafia use this bar as well as several others in the area as their personal banks, where large scores of illegal money are passed through the bar for these mobsters to collect every night.When Marv's bar is chosen as the bank drop for the evening, many people come through slipping under the table large sums of money that goes into a time release safe. In the morning, after the drunks from the night before pick themselves up off the ground, the mob bosses come to collect everything, and you'd better hope all the money is all there. Marv, who is still sore about his bar being taken over by the mob, engineers a hold up of his own bar to score some cash. But this is a mere test for a possible even bigger score later on down the road.Marv doesn't involve Bob in this scheme, because Bob is too smart to do anything too stupid like this. And he is pre-occupied with taking care of a puppy pit-bull he found abused in a trashcan and the pretty woman who helps him take care of it named Nadia (Noomi Rapace). But since the robbery and finding the pit-bull, more trouble seems to find Bob by the way of police detective Torres (John Ortiz), who recognizes Bob from Sunday mass and the neighborhood loser Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts), who starts stalking Bob and asserting that Bob pay him money for the dog and his new female friend.This is not a movie about the powerful mob guys who kill and steal every chance they get. This about the guys who are not in power, who are trying to lead decent lives who might have have wanted more in life, but were too lazy or to stupid to cash in on it, and they are making one last desperate attempt to have a life they wanted. It's quite brilliant in fact. Lehane's script is spot on, as he gives us small details of each character's backstory without giving too much away, so that we may think for ourselves on what their lives were like and how they ended up this way.His work on HBO's 'The Wire' is evident here too. I think the film could have been just as good without Nadia's character, as she doesn't provide anything to the story other than something Bob could look forward to someday. But again, the character is still good and never brings the movie down. This is Gandolfini's final film role, and while he plays something similar to Tony Soprano, you can see his hurt and pain over the years as he has tried to make his family happy. He truly is one of the greatest actors to every grace the screen.And Hardy just gives Bob so many dimensions, and just like in the movie, ""You will never see him coming."" There is so much mystery around Bob, but you like him because he is shy, awkward, and endearing, but he does have a very dark side and you'll want to see how he handles this situation that Lehane and Roskum have conjured up for us in 'The Drop'.",The Drop
69,petarmatic,I was not that impressed!,6,22 January 2015,"Some things I liked about this film, others I did not.I found it touch too slow.But it is a perfect opportunity to make a tribute to James Gandolfini. Of course, his most remarkable role was in Sopranos. Probably, half of the world will remember him by that role. His acting was truly remarkable and I am so sorry that he left us. Even in this film he sticks out from the other actors. If it was not for him this film would of been truly forgettable.What I liked about the plot that it describes ordinary life in suburbia of New York City. It is a truly remarkable part of the world, and I am glad that it was part of this film. Plot is, well, rather average.

73,billygoat1071,Smaller Side of Crime,7,15 November 2014,"The Drop appears as a crime thriller, taking its audience to a gritty life of gangsters hiding their dirty money in drop bars, but this is mostly a drama about a lone bartender thinking on living a different path apart from his cousin's. It also involves a subplot of a man trying to retain his already faded glory. But there is a deadlier conflict lurking in the dark. There isn't much remarkably grand to be found in this story, but telling the details of the characters' past and waiting for the impending danger behind their backs instantly makes it compelling. It benefits by being low-key, but still far from classic. In any way this is still one fine basic crime drama.This is a story where you find no heroes. Bob is basically not the kind of person anyone would fear. In spite of his reserve and kinder personality towards people, you may not know that he is still a tough fellow since he's been adapted into this mess. Things get lighter when he adopts a dog, meets a new friend and starts a relationship, thinking that his life would change for a bit. Once the real threat appears into this small side of his world, we expect him to protect them from harm, but this is not one of those glossy heroic deeds that lead to some action set piece. The thrills are simply calm and with that calmness, you can sense more of the danger coming after himself and his loved ones. If there is one thing we've learn about gangsters in great crime movies then that is how unpredictable they are at killing. That is how often the movie displays its suspense.The story relies to many backstories within its main characters and we could easily comprehend those on their conversations and their lifestyle. The cast helps making these characters engaging, with Tom Hardy layering coldness above Bob's remaining humanity. The late James Gandolfini does beyond brooding, you can feel the character's despair from his old days. Anything else, the actor did what he does best. Noomi Rapace makes for a likable backup for Hardy. And Matthias Schoenaerts is effectively threatening. These performances just live up to the depth of what's written for these characters.The Drop is plain simple, that the only value it provides to its audience is some entertaining cluster with the stars like Hardy, Gandolfini, and Rapace, and some grounded tension. This won't end up being one of the greats since it doesn't actually satisfy in whatever happens in the end, but this is already an interesting study of a corrupt lifestyle at the streets of Brooklyn, with people hiding their own dirty secrets and facing some uncertain consequences. That alone could bring a fine recommendation to this movie.",The Drop
74,rubenm,Good character-driven thriller,7,27 September 2014,"This film starts with a symbolic image: a large bridge reflected in a puddle. It tells us this film is set in New York, but in Brooklyn, across the East River, instead of the more familiar Manhattan. Brooklyn is not as glamorous as Manhattan. It's seedy and it's rough. So are most movies set there. 'Once Upon a Time in America' comes to mind, as does 'Little Odessa', and 'Brooklyn's Finest'. Incidentally, they all have either Brooklyn Bridge or Manhattan Bridge on their film poster. So does 'The Drop'. It shows Brooklyn as an area ruled by Russian (in this case Chechen) mobsters, and filled with streetwise characters. 'The Drop' refers to the depositing of dirty money in a particular bar. The film tells the story of the events leading up to a hold-up of this bar on the night of the Super Bowl. It's a slow, character-driven thriller, in which the acting, the cinematography and the general atmosphere are more important than the action or the suspense. The script is intelligently written, but not every element is necessary for the plot. After his spectacular debut 'Bullhead', this follow-up by Belgian director Michael Roskam confirms his reputation as a very talented film maker.",The Drop

I knew I had to watch it.The film is just a great example of a solid crime drama that doesn't rely on flash or sparkles to sell its story. The story and the themes—like loyalty and secret pasts—sell itself. While the story might come off dry and, realistically, doesn't have much replay value for me, it's still put together incredibly well and is filled with interesting characters that are played by very talented actors.

But even as one man begins to questions his role, his uncle is robbed, setting off a string of events - including caring for an injured pit bull pup - that will ultimately dictate his future.I was really looking forward to This movie, not because of the passing of James Gandolfini, because the film itself looks pretty good. But the movie wasn't coming out til December and I had to wait for long while.... I always hate that. So now I finally watched it and I can clearly say that this is pretty damn good movie.Let's start of with the actor that is no longer with James Gandolfini, and do I really need to explain why he was freaking brilliant in this movie, no not really because we all know he gives a great performance in every role that his in if it's movie and TV shows, But he did a such a amazing job in this movie and I'm so happy he ended on a good performance like this. Farewell James Gandolfini you will be missed. Tom hardy is another actor that I don't really need to go into detail why his a freaking great actor, because this guy has skills and some acting chops. His character in this movie has this boiling rage that he keeps deep inside of him that he really tries to hinds and your waiting for his moment to snap, and Tom Hardy played this role so perfectly that no wonder his my favorite actor of all time. Oh and his Brooklyn accent in this movie was just spot on.This movie maybe slow to some people but to me this is building up to a finale and well it did, also this movie some of the best character development I've seen in a while. The cinematography in this movie was so gorgeous and the way the film is shot you know that that bright vibrant color that infect's the screen with it's sweet looking color. The script was well pretty good and so was the directing. For problems I only have one like: The pasting of this movie can be like a snail at times but has I said it's a build up to something big... you just have to wait a while that's all. Some scenes of this movie could have been edited out, I'm not going to say what needs cutting out because I have to spoil some things but over this is a good film.The Drop is a film that people should see and not leave it in the dust, like good films today.

83,lathe-of-heaven,Solid performances and excellent acting empower this quality film. A camouflaged Film Noir at it's heart... Blu-ray: Very Sharp A:10 V:10,8,2 April 2015,"I will admit, that I nearly missed the point of this film. After seeing as many movies as I have, I feel embarrassed that I almost let this one slip right by me...Where I REALLY began to appreciate the depth and quality of the film was AFTER I finished watching it and while watching the commentary. I think what fooled me at first was that although there DEFINITELY is a strong undercurrent and ponderous mood to the movie, on the surface, I was starting to think that maybe there was a little too much Dramatic 'Realism' for my taste. Thankfully, I stayed with it though and I'm glad I did because it turned out to be a more deeply involving film than I had thought.While watching the commentary and listening to the many different aspects to how the story was written and then how the dialog and structure were continuously tuned throughout the film, and how meticulous the lighting and editing were employed and how bloody much WORK went into it, I REALLY started to appreciate much more fully just how good it was.BUT... even surpassing all the technical excellence was the sublime quality of the acting. These were quite honestly some of the very best performances as a group that I have seen in quite a while. i'm not particularly a Tom Hardy fan, but the masterful way he completely embodied the subtle nuances of his character was most impressive. But, to add even more to the effect, just about all the rest of the performances were outstanding too. From the deliciously perfect James Gandolfini to the chilling performances by Matthias & Michael Aronov, all were WAY above average. The level of quality by so many in the same film really leaves a powerful impression. What I liked about the Deeds character (Matthias) was that I cannot remember the last time I saw a bad guy convey such a genuine mental imbalance, to the point where even in the commentary, the writer says that you sort of feel a little sorry for him. Quite a feat... and Aronov was truly spellbinding; he kind of reminded me of what an idealized Robert De Niro might have been like when he was at his very, VERY best. His understatement was sublime. The way he paused and looked at others when he spoke was amazing.Actually, I think it was the strength of the acting itself which threw me off at first. Because the performances were so strong, I was starting to think that this was just a glorified 'Realistic' Drama, which is not really my most favourite Genre. So, at the very beginning I nearly jumped to the wrong conclusion, and I almost didn't finish watching it. But, I am SO bloody thankful that I did. Because, once I realized the SUBTLETY of the performances and the deeper meaning underneath everything, then I really began to enjoy it. That is likely why you see some reviews here that say things like, 'Boring, Boring, Boring...', etc... Fortunately, I hung around long enough to enjoy a very well made and effective Crime / Drama with more depth than most films of this type.And, like I mentioned before, my appreciation of the quality of the film and the underlying meaning deepened considerably while watching the commentary by the director and the writer. That is why MANY here mention how true Movie Lovers (and makers) will appreciate this film.So, don't make the mistake that I almost made, and make sure to sit back and really pay attention to the SUBTLE nuances and details of the film and enjoy these wonderful, rich characterizations which give so much more depth than is usually seen in these types of stories.",The Drop
84,akcenat,Solid but unexceptional movie that feels almost like a theater play,6,19 July 2020,"""The Drop"", seemingly inspired by 70's and 80's crime dramas, presents you with a quite basic plot which makes this film almost like a theater play or at the best like ordinary TV movie. Over-familiarity clings to ""The Drop"" too much. For those wanting a crime thriller, film may prove a little too detached from the action. At the same time, such fine performance, especially by Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini is enough to make this film to be satisfying, no mater that the romance (Noomi Rapace) is the least interesting part of the story. It could also be said that, the weakest factor of movie is also one of it's strongest - the casting. It's a simple tale that is initially overshadowed by the size of the presences involved. To conclude, ""The Drop"" is cliched crime drama that offers viewers nothing they haven't seen a thousand times before, except solid performances which also include Gandolifini last role (he died just a month after shooting had wrapped on this production). it's just a shame that the film itself isn't all that it could've been.Rating: 6+/7-",The Drop

He's paired here with some of the best, Noomi Rapace, James Gandolfini, and he is their equal.The story is so reminiscent of the kind of story you hear in old urban neighborhoods I thought for a moment it must be based on a true incident. Though I've seen nothing to indicate that with the publicity around this, Gandolfini's last film, I can believe it is and no one wanted to admit it.It will stir people like me who have known people like Hardy's Bob, but it will probably seem implausible to those who haven't spent a little time in rough neighborhoods and that's a shame. This film is far more true to life than many will believe and deserves high praise for bringing that world to the screen so vividly. Only the right sort could have pulled it off and all around this crew was that cast, director and writers. This is a wonderful movie for Gandolfini to go out on and shows how much he will be missed.",The Drop
87,avik-basu1889,A solid but unmemorable film !!!!,7,30 December 2014,"The storyline of The Drop is nothing that a viewer who is familiar with the genre of gangster films hasn't seen before although it is still a very well made film. It is about a man muddled up with gangsters and who feels guilty in the eyes of god. The camera-work specially during the later portions and the editing is good. The starry cast delivers a consistent performance all across the board with Tom Hardy's performance being the most memorable(Hardy is probably my favourite male actor of the current generation). However my reservations lie in the department of the screenplay. There are some elements of the plot that seem too unconvincing and contrived. The film also doesn't have a lasting impact and it didn't stay with me for a lengthy spell of time. It just lacks the bravura and the gritty realism of the famous gangster films that I love.So a very watchable film, but it is not memorable.",The Drop

It fantastically encapsulates a criminal underworld that's so complex and yet believable. The threat is constant and overhangs the entire film making for a tense, looming atmosphere that also allows for some hyper-stylised action and an exceptional twist. The final outing for Gandolfini he delivers a masterclass and charming performance that's in a class with Ledger in the Dark Knight even adding to the film's quality.

90,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,12 February 2015,"Bleak and fascinating, ""The Drop"" stands in the higher ranks of crime drama films of the last few years and provides for yet another flawless performance by the great Tom Hardy and a testament performance by Gandolfini, who shines in all of his brightness, accumulated through a glorious career.""The Drop"" isn't at any moment doing, nor trying to do, something highly original, but thanks to the fact that it knows perfectly well what it's doing it shines on many level, including the story that could be looked as weak from a synopsis, but reveals itself to be quite well thought out as it unveils. Gandolfini as I said is a blast to watch, but what truly makes this movie rise above is Tom Hardy and his amazingly written character. For all the movie I was asking myself, well he is very good as always, but this isn't the brilliance I expect from Hardy. That until the climax where, not to spoil anything, you discover things that make Tom Hardy's performance and character have so much more relevance, so much more brilliance in it, you can't help yourself but bow to the craft of on of the greats. Other than that it is beautiful to look at and paints some images which have really a lot of depth.Speaking of depth, the above points are the only ones in which the movie reaches it. For the rest the characters are either bland or unreadable, the context underdeveloped and the ultimate resolution underwhelming. I had some very good tension kicks out of the film and got awed by the performances and the direction, but there was really nothing that made this movie fly over the roof. It certainly is well constructed and loads better than some of the crappy crime dramas of the last few years, but nothing more. I would recommend this as a good, entertaining watch, but don't expect to be thinking about this one for very long.",The Drop
91,jawneyfloros,one of the best non mob crime thrillers,10,16 November 2018,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that just because you work or live in a certain area doesn't you know all the history or secrets.

92,TheMarwood,Good slow burn,7,2 January 2015,"Tom Hardy gives a good low key performance as a simple man who tends a bar where criminal cash gets dropped off and picked up. This small character piece takes place in just a handful of rundown locations and has a very well done mounting sense of dread throughout. Our lonely lead, Bob finds himself in the middle of a robbery in which cash from very dangerous people is stolen and has also found a beaten puppy in a woman's trash, who he rescues - but it's not before long the psychotic owner of the dog begins threatening Bob. With Bob and the dog's life in danger from numerous potentially lethal people, The Drop always has a hold on your attention as you expect the worst at any moment. Gandolfini, in his final role on screen as Marv - a once successful bar owner, before being muscled out of ownership - is in top form as a man who lost everything and is making a series of terrible decisions. The film is a slow burn, that is perfectly cast and a throwback to gritty, quiet films that seem to be a rarity these days.",The Drop

Could have been made at any times in the last 40 years as this is an age old preface..live by the sword and die by the sword.Very good what you might call a twist and a good open ending that leaves you wondering just how much we were lead to believe about what was really going on.Like many of the ""Life on the street"" movies it shows us that life can be pretty bad and finished at any time.James G gives a remarkable performance as somebody who knows his time is up and the director gives us just enough of a glimpse of small town big city power.

94,troyputland,Hardy and Schoenearts make this film.,8,18 October 2015,"The Drop dapples in genres. Urban drama, psychological thriller, romance, gangster. Tom Hardy's at the helm, running a pub with his older cousin Marv (Gandolfini), one owned by Russians who use it to 'drop' dirty money on select days. Dealing with the fallout of a robbery to his pub is only half his trouble. Bob (Hardy) comes by an abandoned dog in the garden of a stranger's house. He bonds with both puppy and newcomer (Noomi Rapace), but a loose-cannon ex (Schoenaerts) accompanies them, threatening Bob regularly. Hardy's on fine form, playing a hard to judge simpleton with a sporadic nature and a heart of gold. Schoenearts' intimidation is powerful, like a life threatening rash that won't go away. Gandolfini and Rapace are completely outperformed. A shame for the former as it was his last role before sadly passing away. The Drop's twists are foreseeable but the performances of Hardy and Schoenaerts.... and the puppy, make up for it.",The Drop

I guess I should watch it again to fully enjoy the revealing at the end in retrospect, but I'm not sure I can stand it: the first half/tree-quarters is slow, and filled with apparently unimportant things such as the dog. I think the script does not make a good job enough in the slow build-up to keep you on the edge of your seats. I mean the Usual Suspects (and The Drop is nowhere near it) is an enjoyable movie as a whole, not just in the final twist. On the other hand, I've read that there are several hints hidden in the plot, the acting and the cinematography (such as specific lighting), so I guess this is a second-watch movie. Overall, it's a pity because the moral/psychological theme is very interesting.",The Drop
96,trublu215,An expertly crafted film with fantastic performances,10,7 September 2014,"The Drop is a dark, brooding crime film starring Tom Hardy and the late James Gandolfini. Directed by Mikaël Roskam, this film focuses on Bob, a low level shy bartender at Cousin Marv's. The bar is a ""drop bar"" in which the mob's money gets laundered there. While this does sound like the story to The Drop, it isn't. The film is much more a character study first about Bob and his back story. What this film does beautifully is show the progression of the story strictly through casual dialog, explaining why Bob is the way he is. Our first clue to Bob's back story is a subtle hint as he attends church and does not accept the communion offering. A recurring theme throughout the film is the idea of how a sin can weigh your conscious down. Some of this is heavy handed and others are very subtle and mostly through something as small as a glare from Tom Hardy or a sigh from James Gandolfini. Quite frankly, without these amazing performances from everyone across the board, this film would more than likely sink after the first 30 minutes. The entire cast from Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini, Noomi Repace, Matthias Schoenaerts, John Ortiz, they are all in top form here. There is not one hollow or fake performance, they are all pitch perfect and really pull together to mend the story and progress it very well. The real stand out is Tom Hardy though, who continuously keeps turning in really well, thoughtful and master class performances, The Drop is no exception. Gandolfini also gives a fitting final performance here and knocks it out of the park. Watching him on the screen is rather haunting in a bittersweet way. Roskam seems to rely heavily on letting his actors work without every manipulating a scene with high tech camera work or any camera movement at all. This is a straight forward film filled with actual characters that feel alive and feel vulnerable and at any moment their life could end in this world that Roskam creates. This isn't the hipster Brooklyn that Brooklyn has seemingly become lately, this is Roskam's Brooklyn and its a cold land without any glorification. The screenplay by Dennis Lehane is top notch, establishing plot points by sprinkling them across the entire film before finally concluding in a twisted but necessarily dark ending that ties everything together. While this does work for the most part, it does feel a bit muddled in second act as if the story is in some sort of limbo, but it quickly gets back on track in no time. The film does have its lighter moments within dialog and scenes with Rocco the pitbull puppy, but for the most part this a really dark film with an equally gritty scenery. Overall, The Drop is a tense and gritty crime film with an amazing cast that doesn't miss a beat. I highly recommend it.",The Drop
97,ghost_dog86,RIP Tony Soprano,4,18 September 2014,"Let's be honest, you're not really interested in finding out whether or not ""The Drop"" was a good movie. If you're reading this then chances are all you really want is some insight on James Gandolfini's performance, as this was his final film role before his untimely death in 2013. Am I right? Well, either way, I'll get right to it: Gandolfini gives a Tony Soprano-esque performance which, in this reviewer's opinion, was a sight for sore eyes. And while he may garner more acclaim for his naturalistic role in last year's ""Enough Said"", and even though ""The Drop"" is a hodgepodge of disappointments, this particular mob-inspired performance reminds us all how Gandolfini was meant to be enjoyed and remembered.Also, for the Tom Hardy fans out there, his performances are always interesting to say the least. In the case of ""The Drop"" it is the material which fails him. In fact, it is the material which systematically fails this entire cast. Synopsis: Right off the bat, it is explained (by voice-over) that a ""drop bar"" is a legitimate bar where mob money is stashed and/or changes hands. From there we meet Bob (Tom Hardy) who is basically Lennie Small from ""Of Mice and Men"", if Lennie grew up in Brooklyn. Bob is a bartender at said bar, which is run by his much much MUCH older cousin Marv (James Gandolfini) but due to some past mob-related events, is now owned by a Chechen gang. One night the bar is robbed becausewell, as the story moves forward, the reasoning behind the robbery becomes more and more indecipherable. Anyway, after the robbery, the mob obviously wants their money back and that's when ""The Drop"" sort of falls apart, with the introduction of a crazy killer who continuously harasses Bob for the most absurd reasons, Marv's brief revelation of his father's illness which may or may not tie in with his own violent motivations in life and the Chechen mafia's oddly expedient resolution of this film's inciting incident (the robbery) with over an hour left to go in the movie. There is also a subplot surrounding a puppy that is discovered dying in a garbage can and nursed back to health by Bob and a mysterious woman named, Nadia (Noomi Rapace) which is used as a blatant contrivance to tug at the heartstrings and invoke sympathy for Bob, a character with no real personality, as well as sympathy for a plot with no real personality. But an interesting thing happens; after about an hour in, the central mafia story becomes so uninteresting and convoluted, that I came to realize, I was only continuing to watch in order to find out what happened with the dog (the most interesting character). To be fair ""The Drop"" does contain a well thought out twist ending, which works as well as the cherry on top of a vanilla mob story could have. But then again, even this is ruined by a strange John Hughes-style (awkward love story) denouement. Final Thought: I suspect director Michael R. Roskam (Bullhead) wanted his film to be something along the lines of Martin Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" or a smaller (more character driven) New York Gangster movie. But what we end up with is what looks to be a short film (adapted by screenwriter Dennis Lehane's from his own short story, ""Animal Rescue"") elongated by sloppily injecting bits of plot and atmospherical inspiration from other (better) mob movies. Which, on paper doesn't sound unwatchable; only in this particular case, it all seems a bit disjointed when pieced together in a 106 minute film.",The Drop

I was really waiting for this movie to come out as I love Tom Hardy's work and it's unfortunately James Gandolfini last role. They are both fantastic in this movie. When you begin to realize where the story is heading and where the characters are going, at that moment you understand how brilliant this film is; even more when the movie is composing with a lot of talking scenes building the characters. Indeed the movie is taking its time with characters but there are good chemistry between the couples, whether it's between Gandolfini and Hardy or Hardy and Noomi Rapace, they all work well together. However, the movie is really long to set up the main plots. Some scenes may be unnecessary.

104,WubsTheFadger,The Drop,6,9 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the film opens up to Tom Hardy explaining the gangster business and how money is carried throughout the towns. At first, the story seems to be a hit, but it falls flat in the middle. The film takes too much time developing Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace. All in all, the film had promise but falls short in the middle. The ending is well done but it doesn't have a huge impact because of the tiresome storytelling endured through the middle.The acting is very good. Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace perform very well and James Gandolfini truly is one of the best gangster actors ever.The pacing is awful. The film is very slow in the middle and sometimes seems like a never-ending movie. The ending makes up for the slow pacing though.

I thought it was going to be more fast paced with a little more action. I was expecting to see a lot of Tony Soprano in this film from James Gandolfini's character too. I think the laid back approach of this film and of the main character is what made me appreciate it. Bob (Tom Hardy) wasn't the type that played the big and bad gangster roll. He was calm and collective about any situation he encountered and to me that's what made this film what it is. The acting in this film was great especially with James Gandolfini. All of the other characters in this film were real and convincing as well. The story line and plot was pretty good too. Bob (Tom Hardy) works in a bar ""owned"" by his cousin, Cousin Marv (James Gandolfini), and Bob (Tom Hardy) finds himself in caught in a robbery gone wrong.

110,FilmMuscle,Another Marvelous Showcase For Tom Hardy (and James Gandolfini's Satisfying Last Role),8,14 September 2014,"Tom Hardy, since he tremendously introduced himself to moviegoers in 2008's Bronson, has been consistently building up one of the most impressive filmographies in recent years. Like Michael Fassbender (another exceptional actor who blew up onto the scene in the past decade), every time he's involved in a project, chances say it will be good. Even if it might not, you can always expect him to bring his A- game, constantly changing accents, tones, and personalities. This man is a chameleon actor if there ever was one. In The Drop—a tense crime drama—he portrays a reserved bartender in Brooklyn—a bar that's a drop spot for dirty debts and gangster meet-ups—timidly keeping to his business and proficiently doing his duty. He works alongside James Gandolfini who also appears to mind his own and strenuously tries to continue pleasing the Chechen mobsters who pick up their cash deposits from the drop every once in a while. The film is sharply edited where every shot builds further suspense with the complement of a foreboding, eerie score. The cinematography is intricately detailed, expecting the audience to pick up on things as the thrilling plot advances, whether the object of interest is in the background, foreground, or the clear focus in a close-up. The pace of the picture never slugs down since every scene is considerably pivotal and the twists and turns keep coming. In addition to Hardy's and Gandolfini's unsurprisingly fantastic performances, we have a whole cast from the likes of Noomi Rapace (an emotionally vulnerable single woman), Michael Aranov (a chilling, dubious villain as the head of the Chechen mob who makes the viewers anxious with his every glance and subtle threat), and Matthias Schoenaerts (a mysterious and unstable figure) that all share the energy of each scene they appear in. With that being said, the expected romance subplot between the two leads calms the compelling nature of the thriller and arguably takes up too much time even though it ties into the major plot line with its relations (in a somewhat contrived manner, mind you). The very end also feels like it was shoehorned in just for the sake of ending on a positive note rather than an ambiguous/cynical one that the previous scene, with its mesmerizing monologue, set up. The alternative would've been a superior and fitting conclusion for the characters and the overall narrative. On another note, many recent films have failed to deliver on the tension they tryingly promised—films like Gravity and Captain Phillips. Establishing tension is certainly very tricky; one can't drag scenes on for too long, and you can't exhaust your viewers with excessive suspense either. The two heretofore mentioned failed in that regard while The Drop managed incredibly tight editing (efficiently transitioning from scene to scene with a competent beat and continually building apprehension), as well as its eccentric characters that obviously seem emotionally unpredictable. Is this encounter going to blow up into an execution/firefight, or will the rivals peacefully negotiate?",The Drop

After a robbery at his bar, Bob gets tangled in between criminal investigations, the Chechen mob, and a murderer. He must now deal with these multiple threats at all cost for his friends and himself. The Drop, has a slow moving plot in which you get to explore the rich characters portrayed by the excellent cast. This slow pace may be too much for some viewers, but the movie still holds your attention with good dialog and character interaction. In the end the wait pays off as everything culminates to the final intense climax.Full Review:Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini Are there any more reasons you need to watch this movie? They are two incredible actors, and since this is tragically the last movie of Gandolfini, I had to see it. Overall, I enjoyed the movie for its great acting and satisfying story.The strength of this movie is without a doubt Tom Hardy. He plays a character that is quiet, non-threatening, and down to earth. He is very careful about how he interacts with others, be it friends, family, or even the mob. Bob always makes sure he doesn't offend anyone and keeps to himself, like he says ""I just tend the bar."" However, deep down you can see there is an anger and intensity that he is trying to hold back. Throughout the movie there many instances where he is being pushed to his limits and you can see that intensity seeping out. Soon enough it becomes clear that you don't want to be on the receiving end. So I really like how Hardy balanced the two different sides of his character. James Gandolfini was yet another great addition to the cast, playing the polar opposite to Hardy's character. Gandolfini is more outspoken and has a more intimidating presence in his scenes. In the quieter moments his great subtlety brings out the history between characters, adding more depth to their interactions.While the movie is great there is one problem with it that did bother me and may affect others the same way. The story is a very slow burn, it's not till the third act where you start seeing where it is all leading to. Luckily the first two thirds of the movie was put to good use to develop the characters. Nevertheless, I would've liked to have seen The Drop get to the main plot quicker. Don't let this negative detract you from watching the film, because the slow build-up is worth it in the end (can't say more without spoiling it).The Drop is a strong character driven movie. It could've gotten less distracted in the first two acts but the character development was captivating enough to hold your attention. I'd recommend giving it shot in the cinema.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",The Drop
117,ahegde3149,"An unsung gem of 2014, The Drop is a surprisingly elegant film.",8,19 May 2015,"I had not watched any of the trailers or read any review before watching The Drop. There doesn't seem to be much hype about it and I had expected just another generic crime drama. But what a pleasant surprise it was! The Drop turns out to be a dark, tense and taut crime-drama with a subtle script, fabulous characterization and award-worthy performances to top it all. It doesn't have jumpy action sequences every 10 minutes nor makes deliberate attempt at humor. What it gives is realistic character drama under the strong direction of Mikaël Roskam.The name 'Drop' comes from the 'Drop Bars' in the film. Drop bars are one of the bars selected for a day, where all the illegal money laundering takes place, the local mob Chechen collect the money at the end of the day. Bob Saginowski (Tom Hardy) plays a reserved, low-key bartender at one such bars called Cousin Marv's named after his own cousin Marv (played by late James Gandolfini). He lives a simple, shy, single and seems gentle at heart. His cousin on other hand, wants to score big in the mobster business but has never succeed. Bob meets Nadia (Noomi Rapace) when he finds an injured puppy near her house, they both treat the pup and Bob adopts it. Things go awry after 2 punks rob their bar which angers the Chechen. Things get deep when detective Torres (John Ortiz) (who knows Bob as they visit the same church) starts investing it and is suspicious of Bob and his cousin. To make matter worse the pup turns out to previously owned by alleged murder Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts) who starts stalking Bob. The story dwells into each of the character and progresses smoothly just through their regular day-to-day conversations. We also get some insight into the unknown pasts of the characters The subplots may seem a bit disconnected and out of place, but every small thing is wisely connected in a twisty and dark climax.You must note that that there is hardly any action sequences, yet the story keeps you on your toes with its tense buildup and smartly written script. The acting which is even better is the backbone of the film. Tom Hardy gives rock-solid classy performance as the quite and slightly oddball Bob. He makes Bob feel truly authentic and a root for character no matter what he does. Late Gandolfini is splendid as the greedily ambitious cousin Marv. Noomi Rapace also worth a mention for her portrayal of Nadia, a woman wounded by her past somehow trying to heal. Dennis Lehane's (Shutter Island, Gone Baby Gone fame) screenplay is seemingly simple and straightforward. But with lifelike characters and suspense-filled proceeding plots it works astonishing well. The cinematography is top notch. The entire thing handles dark and gritty themes of sin and morality quite very well. The subtle slow soundtrack adds to the feel of it.The Drop is intentionally slow and taut, which might put down many. It reminds me of another film of 2014, Foxcatcher. It has similarly character driven but the story slightly better here. It only feels a bit draggy and lost in the middle section but apart from that its well paced. Overall The Drop was surprise package for me and I feel fine example of well written cinema. The cast is great and the acting top-notch. Fantastic direction and atmospheric score make it immersing experience where you feel being along the characters and their lives. I would say The Drop is one of the dark horse of 2014 alongside the The Babadook and has become one of my personal favorite films of recent times (also become Tom Hardy fan). A treat for cinema-lovers!RATING: [4/5]",The Drop
118,pinokiyo,"""No one ever sees it coming"" Definitely watch it the second time!",7,9 July 2016,"You will question who is the good guy or bad guy. Can ""bad guys"" receive forgiveness or feel guilt? Viewing it the first time, the ending climax scene anticipation is the most interesting part of the film and intense; the second time, all the other scenes that felt mundane watching the first time becomes the most interesting parts. It's very interesting how human perception changes just like that. No one ever sees it coming... This is a true statement for everyone. If you expect fast paced action/car crashes/lots of shooting, you will be disappointed. If you're into analyzing character behavior/psychology, you will love it. There's many subtle clues in this film, even in the way the character's act/eye movement/delivery, that viewing it the first time would seem unimportant or go right by you, but it's very intriguing when you see the significance the second time. Dennis Lehane is also the author for Shutter Island and this film, what was originally a short story (so you can kind of tell they had to stretch the film bit and is slow-paced in the beginning); both are very interesting character study stories and makes viewing the second time a whole new experience.Great performances by all the cast.I bought this because I heard the ending is worth watching; the build-up anticipation is definitely there and then you realize the puzzle - and the clues were throughout the film; there is no way one would realize the subtle meanings unless they watch it the second time; without giving too much away, like the very beginning scene is quite significant clue that would seem very mundane or just a fill-in viewing it the first time. While initially, the film seems very straight-forward and not much happens, but there are many many subtle clues throughout the film and mannerism. Watch it the second time and you will definitely see things differently. There is no way anyone would see the twist coming. If you love smart dialogue crime and into dissecting characters, watch it. It's DEFINITELY worth watching a second time.",The Drop

The plot is fine, mainly predictable but some decent acting by the leads. There is definitely a curious subtlety present in Hardy's character that you hope gets unleashed at some point in the film. Although it does not really get unleashed there is a bit of an answer to the curiosity. Gandolfini seems like he already starred in this movie when he was in ""Killing Me Softly"" last year with a very similar plotstrangeNothing groundbreaking here, not necessarily worth watching again, but not a total disappointment to get through it once.",The Drop

126,fathersonholygore,The Drop is a moody ride through the Brooklyn mob,9,1 December 2014,"The Drop is Michaël R. Roskam's first American film, coming on the heels of his Oscar nominated Belgian crime thriller Bullhead. This film is a slow burn thriller. It moves quietly from one moment to the next to the pace of a brooding score by Marco Beltrami. Roskam sets up several plot points across an interesting set of characters in Brooklyn, New York, which eventually all lead back into one another.The film stars Tom Hardy as Bob, a bartender who works for his cousin Marv (Gandolfini in his final screen performance). The bar, aptly titled Cousin Marv's, runs under supervision of the mob, and at times is the drop point for all of Brooklyn's dirty money; a time they never know until just before the titular drop. The Drop's story commences once the bar is robbed by masked assailants. Both Bob and Marv now find themselves worrying about where they'll come up with the mob's stolen money, or if they can track down the thieves. However, not all is as it seems.Roskam has a unique ability where he navigates an assortment of characters, often with their own little stories aside from the plot's focus, and ties everything back together seamlessly. The film could simply be about mobsters and robbers. Instead it transcends the typical generic plot of such movies. For instance, Bob becomes involved with a woman after finding a badly injured pitbull puppy in her trash, which at first seems unrelated to the film's main focus, but later serves as a way of tying together multiple story lines. It doesn't hurt that this film is also based on the novel Animal Rescue by writer Dennis Lehane, author of such other novels-turned-films as Mystic River, Gone, Baby, Gone, and Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. Often, as it does in this movie, it helps when the script adaptation of a novel is also penned by the author of said novel. With Lehane's tight storytelling and the way in which Roskam presents and navigates the material, the film is incredibly tense. On top of all that the acting, specifically from James Gandolfini, Tom Hardy, and Matthias Schoenaerts who each gives a wonderfully subtle performance, makes everything work so well.Though a little less dark than Lehane's other stories, The Drop is more character study than anything else. Hardy's character is a mumbling bartender who turns out to be more than meets the eye. Gandolfini gives a powerful performance to counterbalance his most well- known character Tony Soprano; here he is a broken man, once respected and now looked at as a joke. Schoenaerts, who previously starred in Roskam's Bullhead, in particular becomes his character, a lowlife thug who is mostly talk, and sucks you into believing he is tough as he acts until the final few scenes.I highly recommend The Drop. Regardless if you enjoyed any of the other films adapted from Lehane's work, this one stands on its own. There are equal amounts of drama and crime thriller mixed together here, enough to please anybody particular to either genre over the other. What makes this worth seeing is the acting and writing, and how Roskam, a European director, weaves the two together in a fascinating way not often presented in American crime thrillers.",The Drop

The bar is used as a Drop by local gangsters to launder money. We witness a robbery at the bar and both Bob and Marv had no choice but to surrender the money from the cash register, but the robbers didn't take the ""Drop"" money.

Still later Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts) comes by and says he wants his dog back. Ah, the complications begin. This is quite a complicated story, told slowly so don't expect any hi-speed chases or unbelievable CGI. Everything is well done and there are twists upon twists so pay attention.

Other fine films have taken me to more interesting universes, to be sure. These characters are compelling. Thinking about what back stories might have made them the way they are enhanced my appreciation. (Doing that has made some other recent major films fall to the ground for me.) Inevitably, actors one has seen a lot of can be a distraction. Knowing that Noomi Rapace is a Swede who speaks four Nordic languages makes her portrayal of a Brooklyn girl whose ethnicity might be several things, none of them Nordic, all the more poignant. I, for one, am still hurting from the needless and meaningless death of James Gandolfini. Tom Hardy was unlike I have seen him before, and totally convincing as a Sylvester Stallone type.",The Drop

132,j-madej,"""The Drop"" is a character driven crime-drama with emphasis on drama.",8,31 October 2014,"Sometimes you don't need an epic story with characters that are larger then life to create interest in the viewer. In fact by creating smaller character driven plot, set on a massive ""stage"", might have a bigger impact on the viewer, who often will try to identify with our protagonist and in this way prolong his interest in the story of the film. The interesting part starts, when the environment the story is set in, creates the characters that has some dirt on them. They are not black and white, good or bad characters. This world is testing our moral values on daily basis. Sometimes small crime can create a ripple effect that effects other in more profound way. And every bad thing just like every kindness, can be a seed that with time will grow to become a root of our moral inner balance. This is exactly what you feel watching ""The Drop"", the second feature film by the director Michaël R. Roskam. ""This film takes an inside look at organized crime's use of local New York City bars as money- laundering 'drops'. When lonely Brooklyn bartender Bob Saginowski (Tom Hardy) uncovers a drop of a different sort in the form of a battered pit bull puppy that he rescues from certain death, he comes into contact with Nadia (Noomi Rapace), a mysterious woman hiding a dark past.""Roskam sets up the story quite straight forward with picking our protagonist to be a Church going Pole who seems subdued and in someway we feel he has something on his conscience, by going frequently to Church but never participating in Holy Communion which for Catholics is the most important moment of the Mass. To except Christ in to your heart you need to absolve yourself from all the sins and for that you need to go to confession. As the story develops we understand the Bob played by Tom Hardy and his cousin Marv (last role of James Gandolfini) own a bar that is used by Chechen mafia to become a drop box for dirty money, from the whole crime related activities in their neighborhood. The bar use to belong to Marv but as we find out later in the story, Russian crime syndicate made him an offer he could not refuse. Another sub plot of this multilayered crime-drama is a romantic triangle between Bob, Nadia and her ex boyfriend small time criminal Eric Deeds (Matthias Schoenaerts). Without giving away the key turning point of the story lets just say that the past has a tendency to confront us when we least expected and appearances might be deceiving. As I already mentioned ""The Drop"" has a few stories intertwined with each other that culminate in the end of the movie. The interesting part is that the European director Michaël R. Roskam chose less dramatic more pragmatic approach to tell this story which stylistically serves movie well. All performances are strong starting with Tom Hardy who picked up a characteristic walk for his character and displays loneliness and sandiness in his eyes that is felt by the character played by Noomi Rapace. A woman with a past that tries to stay away from the bad influences all around her. Matthias Schoenaerts might be a highlight of the film together with James Gandolfini. They both don't have so much screen time and yet their characters are rich in duality through their internal dialog that often is appealing to look at for the audience. I enjoyed ""The Drop"" for what it is, a character driven crime-drama with emphasis on drama in a large sense of this word.For more of my movie reviews go to: www.facebook.com/JanuszMadejTechnique",The Drop
133,thomas-w15,Great Independent Thriller!!,8,20 November 2014,"The Drop- This was the first film I was excited to see since Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and it was for two reasons: the most obvious being Tom Hardy is leading actor and the second is Dennis Lehane wrote the screenplay(you may know him from Gone Baby Gone and Shutter Island.) Those two factors can make any film, at the very least,credible. The Drop was more than credible, it was incredible. With the great acting, underscoring, cinematography, and screenplay, even those who do not like dark films will love this film-noir near- masterpiece. The only reason this film was not perfect in my mind because it started a tiny bit slow and almost lost some of the audience's attention during the beginning. Again, I stress it was only a little slow. It still kept my attention and most of the audience's attention because we could sense that the director was building up to something, and every detail was going to matter. Other than this, nothing else was really wrong. The Drop is one of those few movies where you just leave astounded at how well everything comes together. I mean everything, sometimes I was sitting there wondering what this scene had to do with the plot of the film, and then I was just blown away at the end. I don't expect anything less though, as I had the exact same feeling watching Shutter Island. The feeling would have not been the same if it was not for the amazing acting that built up to the huge shock-and-awe moment. A lot of the credit for this moment goes to the underscoring that really captures the mood of every scene. In my opinion, Tom Hardy is one of the most versatile actors of his generation. He can literally play any role you throw at him. Hardy, who plays Bob Saginowski, masterfully plays the simple-living bartender,just trying his best to live his life. Then there is one of the best crime actors ever, James Gandolfini. For those of you who want to see the character Tony Soprano one last time, James Gandolfini basically plays Tony in The Drop and he does not disappoint. In fact, he goes beyond expectations. It may not seem like this movie looks extremely appealing, but it is a movie you will love watching. I recommend The Drop be your first choice walking in to the theater.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",The Drop

135,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,Tom Hardy Shines and James Gandolfini Leaves Us With a Memorable Performance.,9,16 September 2014,"""I just tend the bar,"" Bob Saginowski innocently states in this under- the-radar gem of a film. Tom Hardy plays Bob, a quiet, reserved bartender at his cousin Marv's bar. Cousin Marv is played by James Gandolfini in his final role. The Drop is getting a lot of attention because of Gandolfini, who gives another memorable performance, but The Drop is much more than an opportunity to see one our generation's greatest actors one last time, it's one of the best films of the year. In The Drop, Marv owns a local neighborhood bar that also happens to be a ""drop bar"", which means the bar essentially collects money from illegal betting and god knows what else and then delivers it to the local Chechen gang. Gandolfini plays Marv as a Tony Soprano that never was. A guy that tried to get into the game, but couldn't really cut it when the big guys came into town. Those ""big guys"" are the Chechen mob that have taken over Marv's bar. It's his bar in name only and he's relegated to serving drinks and cleaning up spills. Gandolfini plays Marv as a bitter, beaten down man. It's vintage Gandolfini and a perfect way to end a career that was cut way too short.As one actor takes his final bow, it's another actor who officially arrives. The Drop is clearly Tom Hardy's film. Granted, Hardy certainly hasn't come out of no where. He burst on the mainstream scene with Inception and should have become a household name after his performance as Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. He didn't, and I'm not really sure why. He seemingly has everything you'd want in a leading man.Hardy's performance in The Drop should finally change that. I know it's early, but it's Oscar worthy. Hardy plays Bob with such an authentic nature that it's downright astounding. He really inhabits this character. Bob seems to take everything in stride, nothing seems to bother him. When he is confronted by the Chechen mobsters, he keeps his head down and chooses every word with precision, knowing that his life depends on it. Bob is non-threatening and unassuming and almost comes off as simple-minded, but as the film progresses, it's clear something is brewing beneath the surface. Bob is an example of a guy who is a product of his environment. He's a good man that doesn't really have a choice in life. He either adapts to survive or dies.Bob also has a big heart as is evidenced when he rescues a puppy that has been beaten and literally thrown in the trash. This is where he meets Nadia, played by Noomi Rapace (Prometheus). Nadia is also reserved and seems wounded in some way. It makes sense that The Drop is written by Dennis Lahane (writer of Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone and Shutter Island) who adapted the film from his short story ""Animal Rescue,"" a title with more than one meaning. Not only does Bob rescue an injured dog, but both he and Nadia seem like animals that need rescuing in one way or another.The Drop is the kind of film that Hollywood just doesn't make anymore. It really does feel like it was ripped right out of the 80's. It has a slow, deliberate pace that perfectly builds suspense. The Drop is a character driven film that constructs each scene with great dialogue and fantastic acting. The director allows his characters to inhabit the world they live in. It's the wardrobe and the set design that really help bring everything together and add to the authenticity of the film. Everything seems organic and not like it's part of a movie set.The Drop is a film lovers film. It has everything you could possibly ask for: a top notch cast, great direction, dialogue, set design, cinematography, and an understated score. You name it, and The Drop has it. It's easily one of my favorite films of the year. We need more films like The Drop. Go see it.",The Drop
136,graupepillard,"The redemption of a ""good"" man",8,15 October 2014,"James Gandolfini's last film, THE DROP is a good one starring Tom Hardy (who I loved in LOCKE), Noomi Rapace and James Gandolfini...my kinda movie full of contrasts. Written by MYSTIC RIVER'S Dennis Lehane and directed by Michael R Roskam, this darkly filmed tale of ""redemption"" - an ""innocent"" man beautifully played by Tom Hardy as Bob Saginowski, a seemingly clueless individual bartender tending bar in a neighborhood Brooklyn hangout; a place where there is both laughter, joy, and deceit, working for his burly cousin Marv (Gandolfini ) whose questionable ethics precipitates a deadly confrontation with Chechyan mobsters who use The Bar as a place for their underworld ""money drop"" (laundering) operations.Great actors operating in luscious, yet stark environs, with a tension that does not let up evident in the terse, almost silent dialogue. One night the ""repentant"" man walking home from work - a man who tries to live a quiet solitary existence - saves the life of an abused pit bull dog; this act propels the plot and alters the situation of key figures in the movie. The cocoon that encased Hardy unravels with the yelp of a vulnerable near-death puppy; and with it a protective instinct is generated which extends to Noomi Rapace - a frightened demoralized young woman whose house and property are pierced by the cries of the anguished dog - a psychotic message delivered in a garbage can.Other characters menace and stir unrest and danger - the plot becomes convoluted and there are scenes giving us the back story of Marv's (James Gandolfini) domestic arrangement with his sister, a man in debt, a father in a nursing home and enormous pressure to get out of town - to get away from it all. His cousin Bob Saginowski is unflappable observing what is going on, but at the same time sympathy and tenderness begin to penetrate his sentient ""stillness."" This could be considered a familiar oft-told- tale, but what makes it a successful movie is THE DROP 's study of the humanization of a person who has ""dropped out"" and the stoic Tom Hardy who does not say much, but through facial and body movements conveys the deeply human need for connection.",The Drop

The opening minute to set up the film was excellent and the first 30 were good. That's about it. The movie just starts to underwhelm after that and the rest of the way on I was hoping for an awesome climax that never happens.There are two main plots in The Drop (SPOILERish). One was in the trailer: a bar with mob money gets robbed. The other one has to do with Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace's character raising an abused dumpster dog, while the previous owner tries to bribe Tom Hardy.I've liked almost every movie with Noomi Rapace in it (except for Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows). So it is surprising she, Tom Hardy (who was excellent in Locke), and James Gandolfini would star in this film. The film has potential, but certain character interactions just do not feel right here. If the film is not going to be a thriller, it needs to have its characters in order. It just seems like someone messed up somewhere whether that's the screenwriter, the editor, or the director. I feel sorry for the three main actors here as they certainly got shortchanged.One final thought is that the film reveals its two main twists too early.

I was checking the time so often throughout this movie it was upsetting. It's an 1:46...felt like an eternity. weak weak weak script. oh god and the cinematography... good god. That blurred POV, slow reveal crap was GOD AWFUL! An incredible cast had no idea what to do with this mess.

141,Mrbigham13,More than meets the Eye.,8,21 January 2020,"At this surface this seems like a slow crime drama, that's where you're wrong. The story may be a tad slow to some but clocking in at less than 2hrs long it's well worth the watch. A slow burn that keeps you guessing till the end. Tom and James are good together even though Tom is hard to get behind at times. He plays an odd character but pulls it together in the end. If you're looking for something interesting with something more than surface level check this out. I enjoyed it.",The Drop

The film never shows its hand as Gandolfini, also superb, and the other characters menacingly revolve around each other. This is great filmmaking.",The Drop
143,DeadMan66,Story should have dropped,3,29 July 2018,"Acting were fine as the story demands. But the story was just slow, simple and little tense. I'd blame the story for giving low rating. Story could have been better with some twist. Moreover, I find some scene were useless and boring just the make the movie long. People need patience to watch the whole movie. Movie starts slow and get tense 20 mins before ending. 
I'd not recommend it because watching it is like waste time you know you are wasting your time but at the end when movies is finished you wished u could have watched any other instead of this.",The Drop
144,Joseph_Gillis,"""No Animals Were Harmed In The Making Of This Production""",6,18 July 2017,"which is more relevant here than in most films, and might even be considered a sub-text for it.Perhaps more telling, though, is that the screenplay was adapted by author, Dennis Lehane from one of his short stories; I can recall successful short-story adaptations, but from such as Borges, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, and Conrad; more often than not, when adaptations of less-feted authors, the plot tends to be stretched to breaking point, where the screenwriter has too many gaps to fill, too much screen-time to pad, and where the story might not have been all that, to begin with.I haven't read the source Lehane short story, so I can only judge what's on the screen, but two things have jumped out at me after viewing the film: one, the conflict between the story's title, 'Animal Rescue', which suggests warmth and compassion, and the film's title, 'The Drop', which the opening voice-over informs us refers to gangsters practices of using legitimate businesses as temporary storage for illicit funds. But yet I don't believe the short story title is entirely ironic, because so much of the film is devoted to revealing Tom Hardy's lead barman Bob character's care and attention for a brutalised and neglected dog. The conflict between those titles suggests more that Lehane was badly compromised between commercial film-making demands, and the intimacy of his short-story characterisation.The other problem I had is the long slow build up, and what it led up to: it's not quite 'deus ex machina' but I had difficulty reconciling the climax with the characterisations that had been slowly and tortuously developed, over 80+ preceding minutes. Which leads me back to the compromise question again.What I did like, though, was the interplay between Bob and the detective, with the detective using their common church-going familiarity to both try to extract information from Bob, and also to get his message across. There weren't enough such inspired ideas, though. I liked Matthias Schoenaerts controlled-scary performance, as legend-in- his-own-mind punk, Eric Deeds. John Ortiz' insidious quiet nagging, as the detective, is another supporting standout. Tom Hardy was just a tad too precious and calculated for me, although he may just have been the victim of too much low-key screen time. (In character motivations, I could make connections with Charles Bronson's similarly-implausible 'Mr. Majestyk') Not the best swansong for James Gandolfini, though - too much of Tony Soprano,albeit a latter-day tired and beaten-down Tony; I would have preferred him to go out on the movie-stealing high of 'Killing them Softly'. That film had all the mood and menace of this one, and then some. Tellingly, perhaps, it's adapted from a novel.",The Drop
145,joris-nightwalker,"Dreary mood, conventional narrative",7,29 December 2014,"There are so many reasons why a movie buff needs to see The Drop. It's James Gandolfini's last picture after his unfortunate death. It's Michaël R. Roskam's (Rundskop) second feature. It also has Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace and Matthias Schoenaerts in it. The story is written by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone and Shutter Island). The cinematography is managed by one of Belgium's finest: Nicolas Karakatsanis (Linkeroever, Lost Persons Area, Rundskop, Violet and Welp). And, above all, when it comes to Belgian presence in Hollywood, The Drop transcends The Loft on every level. Especially the atmosphere (Roskam and Karakatsanis = win!) combined with Hardy's brilliant acting (together with Locke one of his best!) make an exceptional movie experience. Storywise it could've been a bit more interesting though. Just like Mystic River it's all too conventional for my taste. The moral ambiguity of Gone Baby Gone or the psychological twist of Shutter Island had a more enduring effect. While I love The Drop for its dreary mood, the narrative had more potential. Nonetheless a movie that I can highly recommend!",The Drop

The plot is entirely predictable, lacking suspense and thrill.

More could have been done with the material of money laundering, but the film has very little to say about illegal money transfers.None of the actors gave a memorable performance in part because none of the characters are worth remembering.

Hardy, playing the dumb, 'turn the other way' bar tender, who's happy to earn a buck as the patsy, (who sees nothing) for gangsters who now own the bar. Gandolfini, playing the once owner, who's been beaten down to a front for the Chechen mafia, gives a great performance, and plays his role with assuredness and believability. But it's Hardy, the quiet, simple living bartender who makes this film more than just another gangster movie.

Definitely in that first category.More and more I tend to dislike the usual chewed up/spat out run of the mill Hollywood fare that comes by in dozens. I mainly concentrate on European and Asian cinema. But every now and then America still shows signs of movie-greatness with beauty's like ""Killing them softly"", ""The Counsellor"" and now this crime drama that I think can most definitely be compared with those films. Old fashioned character- and story driven movie-making that hits you in the gut instead of computer driven video game making that only makes your gut grow from falling asleep on the couch.And characters it brings. Enough has been said about the beautifully understated role by Tom Hardy, and James Gandolfini, whom I've always enjoyed watching perform, certainly leaves a big void with this being his last performance, man, will he be missed. Noomi Rapace is also noteworthy, but the scene-stealer for me is, again, Matthias Schoenaerts. A menacing, explosive and powerful presence and a very worthy, and deserved, international debut.And it may be purely coincidental (don't think so) but this great director, Belgian Michael Roskam, known for ""Bullhead""(check it out, please) is a European. As is Ridley Scott and Andrew Dominik, while not European, sure as hell ain't from the states either. People making great American movies/stories with new flair and originality.

155,asha-albert,A great story matched by a great performance,10,27 January 2015,"I watched this movie after having read the book by Dennis Lehane - this has got to be one of the few movies I have seen that are as good, if not better than the book. A major reason for this is the incredibly nuanced performance by Tom Hardy. He plays Bob Saginowski, a quiet, shambling man who tends bar, along with his cousin Marv (James Gandolfini in his final role). Bob seems to be everyman, content with his quiet life, living alone, until he rescues a pit bull puppy that's been abused and abandoned. He also meets Nadia (Noomi Rapace); it's in her trash bin that he finds the dog. We also find out that his bar is actually a ""drop"" for illegal betting money that flows through the city; this makes it a target for a robbery that eventually goes very very wrong. Anybody who has loved a pet will understand why Bob does what he does, when his dog is threatened. And anyone who hasn't had a pet will also understand this, because of Hardy's powerhouse portrayal of Bob and what drives him. Bob's quiet exterior hides a whole different interior life, full of secrets and sins. Hardy conveys as well as conceals this secret life effortlessly, building up the suspense, until his secrets are laid bare in one single explosive scene.Other than Hardy, it's Gandolfini that delivers a fantastic performance as Cousin Marv, destroyed by greed. A fitting swan song. While I did not recognize the other actors, other than Rapace, they are all good and fit their roles perfectly. In any case, this is a Tom Hardy movie; it doesn't matter who else is in it!",The Drop
156,UsernameHype,For a simple premise The Drop was pretty good.,7,27 July 2015,"The story was just about two guys running a drop off bar dealing with mobsters after their bar was robbed. I can't go deeper than that without spoiling anything. The side stories that felt like they were out of place in the beginning all tied in to the end and the backstory of characters, which I liked. The side stories help you understand the characters better and gave more insight to what they do and why they do it.The acting was good for the most part. The two that stood out were Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini. Tom Hardy had parts were he slurred his words and you couldn't understand him, but that happened mostly in scenes that didn't play a huge part in the overall story. James Gandolfini didn't have that many scenes, but the ones he did were good. The other actors and actresses were good, but nothing that really stands out as noteworthy.The camera work was good, there were some nice shots in the buildings. A lot of the shots were foreshadowing to characters and what they have done or will do, which was interesting.Overall, good movie, it kept me entertained for the 2 hour run time. In fact, it never felt like 2 hours, that's how much it had me sucked in. It's worth a watch.",The Drop
157,danren121,Worth a watch,7,7 August 2015,This is a film where the acting does the talking even when the actors don't actually talk much.

Bob is a no nonsense kind of guy whose paternal sensibilities are aroused by the adoption of an abandoned dog the animal incarnate of helplessness and by default innocence.Bob works in a bar where drops are made; that is cash deposited from illegal gains.

I just expected a faster pace and hoped for a memorable performance from James Gandolfini in his final role. If he knew it would be his last film, I think he would've tried to do more than show us how Tony Soprano would've ended up had he been run into bankruptcy and lost all of his connections in the mob world. Tom Hardy and Noomi Rapace stole the show however. In their characters, there is something very simple about both who they are and what they are working through, and it shows even when there are no words.

This, is at least 8 star movie, I'd give it 10 just to raise the rating (I would give it 8,5 actually) So, why this movie doesn't deserve 7.STORY: The story is about crime in a city. It's not that crime movie with lot of action, but the story engaging and well told, it's really good story with good twist, it's that kind of story that made u curious the entire time.CINEMATOGRAPHY (WOW): The setting in this movie is in bad neighborhood in US , around and in the bar. Sounds bad to watch? Not in a hands of amazing cinematographer.. this movie has superb cinematography, wow.I am so impressed just by that aspect of it. Wow what beautiful shot. They even play with the lightnings , something I rarely notice in a movie. You know if the scene is a painting, is that painting that always have beautiful color palette, that's how good the shot in this movie. Salute to the director and the DOP. Make sure you watch it in good HD TV so you know what I am talking about.CHARACTERS: Bob the bartender by Tom Hardy. He is the sympathetic character. Tom Hardy is great, he is kinda adorable in this movie :P, and I think now he is the sexiest actor. I just love him as Bob.Nadia the one who treated the dog, the girl with abusive ex-boyfriend. I wish Nadia is prettier, she is not that pretty. Don't expect any sex, it didn't happen. She keeps getting spotlight because everybody love her, since her performance in A Girl with Dragon Tattoo. She is good actress though. She is the main character love interest.Nadia's ex-boyfriend, he is intimidating, give me the creep In a way he is the main villain. I don't know the one who played the character, but he delivered the character quite well.The detective by John Ortiz. Man, Wrong actor, he is not that good. He didn't add any tension. Probably because I watched him before in comedy TV show, well, I don't know.

But everything that drops, sometimes also come up. Happily the writers accomplished that.The writers were in a world they created by themselves. Almost every scene was presented as a unnecessary contribute to the big picture. Decoration was needed to be found to make it a good meal.

161,Drive-in_Zeppelin,A Smart Suspenseful Crime Drama to Start the Fall Season Off Right,8,4 October 2014,"The Drop (2014) is the latest screen adaptation of Dennis Lehane's writings (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island), and is directed by the relatively unknown (though hopefully not for long) Michaël R. Roskam. Knowing very little about this movie beforehand, the one thing I was gambling on was its cast; a gamble that thoroughly paid off I might add. Tom Hardy (Inception, The Dark Knight Rises), Noomi Rapace (Prometheus, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo), and everybody's favorite soprano James Gandolfini star in this gritty crime-drama that reminds us all that you don't mess with people's bars. We the audience find ourselves in the chilly streets of Brooklyn once again and in that most sacred of places - the local bar. Tended by the mild mannered, possibly slow witted bartender Bob Something- or- other (Hardy), this bar, like all good bars, has its frequent patrons that pile in night after night, raising a glass to a dead friend's anniversary or simply watching the game. The bar itself, named for Gandolfini's character ""Cousin Marv"", just happens to be the setting for an elaborate money drop off system (hence the title) and is frequented by the Chechen Mobster owners that cousin Marv is constantly trying to appease (having apparently lost ownership of his namesake in the not too distant past).Naturally the conflict arises that, since the bar is occasionally home to large sums of money, some folks inevitably want to hold up the joint. Eventually things go south as the Chechens aren't too happy to have their money stolen and what follows is an incredibly intricate, but unassuming narrative. Noomi Rapace plays the fragile love interest and Tony Soprano playswellthe small time crook that pines for the respect he had in the glory days. While I don't want to cheapen the roles of Gandolfini or Rapace in this film (as they both are extremely important in driving the film to its crescendo), Hardy stands out for his performance as the unassuming Bob the Bartender. One thing that I love about the actor in his films is that he easily adapts and manifests himself into his characters - seamlessly adopting accents, quirks, etc. (I'm thinking Bronson not Bane). It was disarming to me to follow his story, ever-waiting for a massive plot twist to signal his call to action, only to have it continue on at its pre-established rate of reveal.Therein lies the beauty of this movie, as it never departs from its inconspicuous tone until, much like the ambiguous quote at the end, you never see it coming. Like putting a puzzle together without looking at the box, you gradually see characters, conflicts, and resolutions weave together and develop over time. Having seen Lehane's other work Gone baby Gone (2007) not too long ago, I found The Drop to be just as refreshing albeit with a much simpler, linear buildup. One device the director uses particularly well in this film is slightly off focus scenes with relevant characters or items of interest often pushed in the background. These shots work nicely with the eerie accompanying score to really drive home the apprehension that at any moment someone is just going to get shot in the face or worse.It goes without saying that I'm always going to recommend a movie like this simply because it has so many things that work in its favor. It has a quality cast including an exceptional performance from Hardy as Bob the Bartender, a rewarding narrative, and if nothing else – an adorable puppy named Rocco. The romance subplot initially seems distracting, but ultimately ties in nicely as does the religious underpinnings on morality. The Drop is definitely worth it to see it in theatres and it's not terribly violent or profane for a rated R movie.Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website",The Drop
162,jacobsperling,One of the most underrated pieces of cinema I've ever seen. Excellent.,9,27 June 2021,"99% of movies released today are complete garbage. That's why when a quality film comes out, it makes for such a pleasant surprise (unfortunately, Christopher Nolan can't make a movie every year, but that doesn't mean I don't hope). What's even more surprising is when a film comes out that nobody notices, that flies under the radar, but is sheer, terrific cinema.And The Drop is exactly that.For starters, the film boasts absolutely incredible acting, headlined by the 4 phenomenal lead performances of Tom Hardy, who is freaking brilliant as usual, Noomi Rapace, James Gandolfini (hauntingly memorable in his final role), and Matthias Schonaerts, a Belgian playing an American so well I didn't even realize who it was until the credits rolled. But it's not just the acting-Michael Roskam's direction is excellent, really allowing the emotional weight and themes of the film to flourish, along with Dennis Lehane's terrific script. The authenticity of the Brooklyn community the film portrays is first class; I live near these neighborhoods, and can testify that the film got everything-and by everything I mean EVERYTHING-right about them. Perfection.But the brilliance of the movie lies in its character focus, specifically the contrast between the characters played by Hardy and Gandolfini. The themes of the film are so potently reflected in their characters; how troubled pasts make for troubled futures, and how the difference in the choices between men of said same past make for different men in the future (Hardy's character has an incredible monologue on this near the film's end).In short, The Drop may not be a Nolan-level film, but is an excellent slice-of-life drama with first class acting and direction. Phenomenally underrated.",The Drop
163,jormatuominen,Masterfully directed crime mystery,9,17 April 2017,"Time will tell, but the Drop certainly has the makings of a crime film classic. Firstly there's the beautifully well-crafted script by the writer Dennis Lehane, this time set in Brooklyn of recent past instead of his beloved Boston. The setting is so believable you can breath it. The characters are all people of the hood just trying variously to cope with the times and circumstances. None of them a rocket scientist really, just everyday people. One of the main characters we never see, because he has gone missing probably dead years ago. Yet people keep talking about him and the viewer realizes that this past mystery may be the key to what's going on. Normally there would be a flashback somewhere to show what happened to the guy, but this film uses no such devices. There is a strong financial incentive to break the laws of the street, as the title the Drop suggests, but the Chechen mafia in power seems to know or find out everything and will deliver punishment to those who are stupid enough to think they can fool the mob. The dialogue is sparse. Slips of tongue can be and are dangerous. The characters communicate with hints and facial expressions. It is the viewer who has to connect the puzzle pieces Lehane keeps slowly handing out throughout the film. After all, none of the characters are exactly law-abiding so it's not obvious all the time which crime is the real mystery. The Belgian director Michaël R. Roskam appears to me as a master of getting subdued yet nuanced performances from his actors. One of which, Matthias Schoenaerts whom Roskam brought with him from Belgium, does a very threatening bad guy indeed. There are some more Europeans. Noomi Rapace from Sweden is great as the fragile and secretive beauty of the film. Tom Hardy has the enigmatic lead role for which he has been appropriately praised. He's so Brooklyn here that I completely forgot he's from England. James Gandolfini is great in his final role of the greediest barkeeper ever. There are many reminders of film noir and the Hitchcock way of surprising the audience time and again. The cinematography is very old school, no car chases or martial arts. Were there any aerial shots? - I don't think so! In this film, the atmosphere is so tight that such things would have been mere distractions. I do think this will be seen as a classic!",The Drop

Various people posturing looking for a score while not knowing who is who and all having to watch with the menace of the foreign gangsters. Better film than I expected and well worth watching. Probably not a good advertisement for Brooklyn which looks bleak and harsh but then again this is a gangster film with all the characters having some edge or background to them.

The pacing of this movie is flawless, the dialogue is great and the characters have such depth, it honestly catches me off guard.It's also a beautiful movie. The camera work really compliments the intensity in a lot of the scenes.There are so many movies in the thriller genre considered ""classic"", but I can honestly say that this is one of the most suspenseful and chilling experiences I've had. I wouldn't say this is Tom Hardy's greatest role (mostly because I believe it is entirely too subjective), but I would say he's just as perfect and precise in it as he is in Legend, Lawless, Bronson...Schoenaerts is also incredible.

He said that it was a work in progress and that he custom wrote parts for each of the actors as they came on board the project. For him to listen to all these stars pulling him in different directions while keeping true to a clean crisp script is a remarkable example of his patience and communication abilities. It was nice for his efforts to be realized. At first he didn't appear on stage and was called up by the director. I hope he gets some credit for his talents. Well done.Fine performances from all involved. I think it's easier to get better efforts from a talented cast when there are not a lot of set and location changes.

A combination of every bad cliché from a crime film, wooden acting oh and a cute little dog that the boring barman (Tom Hardy) found in a bin belonging to a girl who he strikes up a friendship with who then naturally agrees to be paid to look after the dog. Nothing happens in this film, the plot, if there is one, is illegible, I'm still not sure what the film was about after watching it. A series of scenes with one-dimensional characters who have overemphasised Brooklyn accents and wooden acting. Occasional bits of gratuitous violence are added to the boring plot, but add nothing to the actual plot.***Here's the spoiler*** the dog doesn't die, but you will possibly will die of boredom if you dare to watch this terrible film. Slow moving and tedious to the extreme, one of the worst films I've seen in a long long time. Rocco the dog gave the best performance in what was otherwise a totally boring turd of a film.It's like someone asked a group of actors to put on their most stereotypical performance for a New York crime drama, reading a telephone directory and pointed a camera at them.

Bob tends to keep his distance from all the illicit dealings, and lives a humdrum life with a recently acquired dog and girlfriend. However the bar is a hub for all sorts of shady dealings, and Bob gets drawn into its dark shadow.This film is a mess, the two major plot lines are clunky and don't flow together as one. Firstly the robbery plot line is convoluted; the reason for the robbery is to establish how the Chechens reaction. And they come down on the robbers like a ton of bricks, yet this intense reaction is ignored by the other characters for their future plans. Then Hardy's love story is patronised and contrived, having a puppy for the audience to immediately connect to is like that sleazy guy who only has a dog to pick up chicks. Then shoving in an antagonist to allow for a resolution of this plot line feels abrupt. There is also the subplot of the cop's investigation; which goes nowhere, and just serves to remind us things we already know.Character motivation is completely contradictory. Marv is shown in the introductory scene as hard and money-wise, this is contradicted by debts from a previous life, his reaction to an extreme violence and his relationship with his sister. Bob is shown in first 5 minutes to be a soft heart, but immediately after when he has to adopt the dog, he seems reluctant, I ask what was the point of showing he treated the old lady at the bar well (a really weak excuse was given later, and still didn't make much sense.)Editing is god awful, each scene has perhaps 10 cuts, Michael Reynders clearly doesn't trust his actors. There are also a handful of re-shoots, and they are poorly inserted. Visually the film is also boring, and at times awkward; hand-held shots inserted for no real reason, and bad lighting with shoddy angles makes it hard to distinguish how the scene is progressing.This is not a completely negative review; there are two things that save this film from failing. The resolution of the 2 main plot lines is actually well done, the revelations when they come are satisfying and were foreshadowed well. Which makes me think that the ending of the film was written first, and the rest of the film was sculpted around that. Also the actors in this film really sell their performances, Tom Hardy once again dominated the film with a superb performance. Gadolfini played Gadolfini, and the supporting cast added flavour to Hardy and Gadolfini's performances.This type of film has been done a few dozen times before, look to David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" if you want to watch a competent version of this film.",The Drop
172,AverxgeJoe,It's probably better as a novel,6,2 October 2015,"The Drop was an alright movie.I thought the acting was great. This was the last movie James Gandolfini was in before he passed away. He did leave giving a great performance, rest in peace. The score was alright, nothing too fancy, but not anything special.The big problem I had with this movie was the pacing. It starts out really slow. The ending is great on many levels and gives you closure, but it feels so long to get there. Also I did note some plot conveniences, that kinda bugged me.I have a feeling that this story is a lot better in it's original form, as a short story called ""Animal Rescue""",The Drop
173,johnnyinmtl,Watch it! NOT a disappointment at all.,10,7 February 2015,I really get a kick out of reading most of the reviews here on IMDb.A huge percentage of people actually think that their reviews are life changing and everyone will either watch or not watch a movie based on what they say.Please ignore any review.Just watch the film.It was a totally unexpected story for me.The acting is great. The story is great.A totally refreshing surprise of a movie.TREAT YOURSELF!,The Drop
174,MovieloverIreland,Dark horse,7,2 January 2015,"Whilst watching this i kept getting flashbacks of Dead Man Down, The lovely Noomi Rapace is in both and has scars in both. This is a hard movie to review as there is not a lot to love or hate with passion. I enjoyed the performances but found the plot ponderous save a neat little twist at the end. I'm not sure i could enthusiastically tell a mate they HAVE to see this movie yet if it came on TV i would say ""its a good movie, give it a watch"". I wasn't overly fond of the whole dog subplot, it just felt manipulative to me as if the writer thought that anyone who cares so much about a dog must be a good person leaving twist at finale more of a shock. But that's just a little niggle, performances were fine, a good send off for Gandolfini.",The Drop
175,SenorLengua,Excellently Craft and Performance,9,1 March 2015,"The Drop is one of those movies that slowly builds though ""could happen"" events and occasional reveals. In this way, it felt quite a bit like Eastern Promises, and as good as Viggo Moretnsen is in that movie, Tom Hardy is just as good here. This movie, as may be known, was James Gandolfini's last role, and much like most of what he did, it is excellent. It was refreshing to see Noomi Rapace in a quality performance having moved beyond the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy (Swedish version). Rounding out the primary characters is Matthias Schoenaerts, the weakest of the four, but that seems to be as much to the script as both the character and the actor morph as the movie goes along.With Gandolfini in this movie, and it taking place in New York City (Brooklyn), there is no doubt that this is a mafia/gangster movie. But this is not the Sopranos-type of movie. The characters are people more in the middle, having to deal with lives in middle, and all the baggage that comes from being in the middle. Each of the characters has their own back story, each revealed in a natural way such as one reveals upon meeting a new friend or partner. Beneath all of the reveals, each being important to both the characters and the story, there are clearly things left unsaid that ""could be."" Clearly, the thinking is that we know this is a gangster movie and we assume that something dramatic will occur, and the writer, Dennis Lehane, plays with that which keeps the story interesting.There is a single event that is contrived (it is obvious when watching the movie) but it is necessary and does not detract from the overall. Much could be said here about character personalities, but I think that would be giving away too much of the development of the story (even though other reviewers have done so). And the conclusion, the final lines spoken, are the true reveal, and, spoken almost as an afterthought, make most of the preceding events clear. And Tom Hardy is fantastic.As a story, this is not one to miss. Highly recommended, and I might add it to my collection. Finally, though this movie is rated R, the violence is not overtly graphic, the language is not excessive, it could easily pass for a strong PG13 rating, and most high schoolers could handle this.",The Drop
176,ravimirna,Brooklyn underworld,7,6 February 2021,"It is a crime drama devoid of action of any kind. It's more character driven. Director is to be applauded for giving a crime drama without usual dose of gun , bare knuckle fight scenes. Tom Hardy is the present day Charles Bronson. His rugged looks and eyes do the rest. Though I am a lover of aderline pumping action movies, I watched this movie fully because all the lead actors gave excellent performances. Animal lovers will give thumbs up for the film.",The Drop
177,sivanandrao,Unexpected Goodie!!,8,17 February 2015,A simple plot. With a lot of twist of turns. The way it is told is good.English debut of the director and he has done a well worth job. Tom hardy in the lead role is believable. James Gandolfini's last movie and a decent job from him. Noomi Rapace as the scared girl in the neighbourhood is fine.The story revolves around a silent guy who works in the bar. A dog that he is fighting to keep. A girl who takes care of the dog and has a troubled past. A guy who owns the dog but wants money from Toom hardy for him to keep it. A guy who owned the bar and is not able to come to terms with the bar taken over by Chechens.The last 5 to 10 min of the movie takes wild turns and should be watched. I will not reveal anything more as it will spoil the fun of the movie. Watch it!!,The Drop
178,stemal-1,Slow burner fails to ignite,6,24 December 2014,"Based on a short story. Words that, in my experience, suggest it's unlikely there's going to be sufficient story to sustain a full-length film.And that's the case here. It's a decent movie, the performances are fine and there's an underlying sense throughout of impending violence bubbling under the surface.But ultimately it's all a bit ""is that it?"". There is very little to it, promise that isn't fulfilled. Very low key. Even the people we are supposed to hate aren't particularly menacing.Tom Hardy was great in a subdued way, but he must have been begging to be let off the leash to put just a little energy into the film.I ended up giving this 6 when I was convinced an hour in that it would be an 8, which is why I am so disappointed with what is otherwise an OK film.",The Drop
179,JasonKleeberg,"""Are you doing something desperate? Something we can't clean up this time?""",8,17 January 2015,"You had me at ""Tom Hardy and a puppy.""The Drop stars Tom Hardy as Bob Saginowski, a bartender at a corner bar that also serves as a drop location for mob money. James Gandolfini plays Marv (who runs the bar) and Noomi Rapace is here as Bob's main squeeze.The story isn't a complicated one, but the characters stay busy and have clear motivation. To be honest, there isn't much to the story at all, but this movie will keep your interest because of one thing - Tom Hardy. Tom Hardy is an on screen chameleon. He's fantastic here as Bob, a vulnerable 'down-and-almost-outer' just trying to scrape by. Things change for the creepy when he finds a baby pitbull in a trash can one night on his way home from work. It's hard to believe this guy was Charlie Bronson in the fantastic Bronson (2008). Heck, while Bob stands toe to toe with a local trouble maker at one point during the film, I couldn't help but think ""this guy broke Batman's back as Bane...surely he can beat the hell out of this schmuck!"". It was fun watching Hardy here with his thick Brooklyn accent - he clearly stole the show.James Gandolfini holds his own as an old, washed up gangster in his final role - the same magnetism he always had on screen - but I think that the other main key to this flick is the terrifying Eric Deeds, played by Matthias Schoenaerts. While watching, it's hard to not think about what you would do if confronted by the reality of a guy like Deeds stalking your every move. His performance is simply chilling. Noomi Rapace is adequate as Nadia. I found her role in the movie to be pretty organic and unforced, but I do think she is the weakest thing about the story.Overall, I thought that The Drop was a very good crime story. The plot is nothing that you haven't seen before, but the cast does a fantastic job and the ending is really freaking cool.My final grade: B+",The Drop
180,gmh-46567,silliest gangster dialogue I've heard,2,26 August 2019,Tom Hardy is such an overrated actor and his one dimensional style is in full display here.

184,nox09,Leon and the flower ? now we get Bob and the puppy,8,3 January 2015,"another great story from Denis Lehane , the guy who gave us ""gone baby gone"" ""shutter island"" and my favorite Mystic River . this time the storyline is more predictable but not less enjoyable to watch . the film has very dark atmosphere u know something wrong can happen any second and it creates tension . the acting is the strongest part of the film in my opinion , Tom Hardy was just on other level , officially in my favorite actors list after this :) James Gandolfini was as good as in sopranos and Noomi is an expert in playing such characters so it works out well . the movie pretty much does not have any dynamics and action ( which i really liked ) movie slowly progress to his third act were it lets Tom hardy shine and give strong finale to the movie. the main thing that i felt was bad was the detective character who was trying to bring philosophy but director kinda fails on that part it was not well developed and didn't work out . cinematography was good not bad but could have been better . objectively this movie has flaws but overall its a very good criminal drama movie , with amazing acting and lovable characters and good plot . this year i enjoyed this movie the most along side with interstellar and Foxcatcher that's why i give itwe need more puppies in the movies nowadays",The Drop

One of the things i liked most about this movie is how it builds, you slowly are given more details to the story without ever knowing where its going for sure. I first started watching this movie to take my mind off things before i got ready for bed and work the next day. i originally intended to watch a half hour of it then head off to sleep but i could not stop watching because it built so well in my opinion. There were very slight parts of this movie that were vague and i think a few things could have been done better. However i don't want to take anything away from this film because i was very entertained and the issues i had with movie were slight. If you like these actors or this genre you wont be disappointed!",The Drop
186,PostingandToasting,The Drop: Low-Key Intensity and the Potential of Danger,8,14 September 2014,"There are a lot of films that fall into the same sort of ""ilk"" in the sense that when we watch a particular movie, it gives us the same feel as others we have seen before it. This can be a reason why someone really enjoys it or gives the pretentious ""it wasn't very original"" remark that makes you never watch a movie with that fool again. ""The Drop"" brings out similar feelings, primarily because it has the feel of many other works of the author (and writer of the script) Dennis Lehane who is famous for works such as ""Mystic River"", ""Shutter Island"", and ""Gone Baby Gone"". Right away you get a feel for those previous works as we are again introduced to a gritty, seedy, and corrupt underbelly of a big city environment that introduces us to a bunch of low lifes who are caught up in doing the wrong things just to ""make something of themselves"".What makes ""The Drop"" different from some of these other films is that these are different characters compared to what we're used to. No one seems to be a big talker and we can tell that all of these characters are more than meets the eye and carry significant baggage from a checkered past. Most films that deal organized crime and other things ask us to witness the violence that just seems to ""come with the territory"" so to speak with it. This film asks us instead to imagine the potential for violence in a man and how brief releases of that violence can affect how these characters live their lives in the future. There are moments of violence and bloodshed, but they come in such short and intense instances that they hit you harder then violence might normally would in another film of this sort. You believe that any of these characters is capable of beating another ones head in and when something of that sort actually happens, it sticks with you and has a lasting effect that carries throughout the remainder of the film.The story follows Bob Saginowski (Tom Hardy) and his Cousin Marv (the last film of the late James Gandolfini) who run what's known as a drop bar which simply mean that they serve as a place where mobsters leave large amounts of illegal money to pick up at a later date. Cousin Marv used to be a man of his own power in the organized crime world and briefly had his own crew before he was pushed aside by an incoming Chechen gang and now he just manages the bar with Bob. 10 years has passed sense this change but Marv is still as bitter as ever about his position in life. Gandolfini excels in roles like this for so many reasons. Of course we see a little Tony Soprano in Cousin Marv but he brings so much else to this role from his tone of voice, expression with his eyes, and physical presence that makes the performance that much more captivating. It's great to watch him be able to display that intimidation factor as the ""tough guy"" that Marv wants to be seen as, as well as the fear and weakness that really exists in his heart.....all being shown through his eyes. It's the kind of performance that has a low-key profoundness that makes you hope the academy rewards a posthumous Oscar nomination.Hardy is no less brilliant here as the quiet and mysterious Bob. Bob is not a big talker and just lives quietly in his own little bubble tending bar and handling the drop. His life is changed when he finds a wounded puppy in the trash can outside of the damaged Nadiya's (Noomi Rapace) house. They both decide to take care of the dog together as a potential budding romance threatens to grow. Bob has almost an instant connection with the dog, a young pitbull, and you begin to notice similarities between the two as the film progresses. Bob makes a comment that a pitbull is a ""dangerous dog"" which is true, but almost seems impossible to think when you see them as puppies. Bob can be looked at the same way as the puppy in the sense of he seems harmless but there is the potential for danger and violence deep inside both of them. I've always found it amazing how well British actors can master American accents compared to the other way around. Hardy especially is a master of accents and the way he handles his blue collar, Brooklyn speak is amazing to watch as we follow the mysterious Bob throughout the film, always wondering what he is thinking and what he really is about.The other stand out performance in the film comes from Matthias Shoenaerts as the loose cannon, Eric Deeds. Shoenaerts brings a level of intensity that is so palpable that you often become uneasy when he is on screen. He spends the majority of the film claiming that Bob's new dog is his and that he wants him back, as we all are questioning what he is really after. Shoenaerts is a rising star for sure and I can't wait to see him continue to show what he's capable of a bigger stage. In the end, ""The Drop"" is most likely going to be one of those early fall gems that falls by the wayside after a few weeks in theaters and is unfortunately forgotten about due to poor marketing. However, it also could be one of those small festival films that develops a cult following after people realize how good it is for being a slightly slower paced thriller that delivers great performances and a good story. In a way, that almost fits perfectly into the makeup of these characters who live in this world. Great and powerful things in small and low-key packages",The Drop

But the reality is : I couldn't get my attention out of the movie, I was lost in it.It is a dark-crime movie, with a little cold-blooded touch, and a deep layered story, making it unique in its own way.. There are a few gore (but not really that gore) scenes which give you the tension and show how serious the problem can be, and the mystery is slowly revealed one by one, making me curious of what will happen next. The movie will force you to sit and watch it until the end.Warm and romantic touch also present in the movie. You can witness a soft and weak side of a usually-badass-character-Tom Hardy.The plot was slow-paced but I think that what makes the audiences able to feel the sentiment, making the movie perfect.Every movie has their own weaknesses, but I don't see one in The Drop, so 10/10.",The Drop

I could also say that it is about a man and his dog but many might not find that intriguing. At first Tom Hardy plays a simple man working at a bar that was once owned my his cousin Marv but was bought out by gangsters,Now both he and Marv(Gandolfini) work at the bar which is also a money drop off. There is also a romantic interest although its not what you think,that ties into the main story at the end. The heart of the movie is Tom Hardy and the dog and those looking for a crime and gangster flick should know that although this film may seem that way,it is really about a character study.Its About how good and evil people really are. What makes the film brilliant is that it shows Hardy starting off as a simple man and he ends up being the smartest one in the movie. I compared this movie to Out of the Furnace because although Out of the Furnace was panned by most and Drop was raved many people they both share a deeper story within its simple plot. This is a deep and beautiful film that I urge everyone to see.Many might find the build up to the final act slow, but I found it perfect. Note: Those looking for an action packed movie should know that the only violence in the movie is in the last 15mins but that does not take away to how great the film is. The Drop was rated R for some strong violence and pervasive language. I hate that the mpaa get the ratings wrong. This film should be rated R for brief strong violence and for language.",The Drop

I am increasingly of the mind to that Tom is the new Robert DeNiro in his prime - subtle, intense but not quite brooding, broad, just... flat out a pleasure to watch work. I remember him from his small role in Band of Brothers and even then, you could tell there was something there.

198,majaho21,The film that wants you to watch it again,8,3 March 2017,"The simplicity of the story and the slow- paced narrative of the film are alluring. The film deals with money laundering and the underground life of a normal popular bar in Brooklyn. And the main protagonist is simple, he just ""tends the bar"", nothing more.The quality of the film lies in the fact that simple events and naive and everyday talk between characters create a tremendous turbulence in the way the neighborhood works. *Spoilers* A simple dog-lover and worker at the bar, Bob, tries to live as normally as possible. He works with his cousin Marv who is a bar owner. However, things have changed after the Chechen mob decided to use the bar for their illegal transactions. While Bob accepts the things as they are and lives within that hierarchy, Marv is desperate and angry because his role in the bar is minor. He just has to obey the orders by the mobsters. Since he cannot accept the situation, he unsuccessfully tries to trick the gangsters and steal their money.Bob's and Marv's roles are tremendously played. While Bob talks slowly, doesn't understand irony, seems to be not very smart, Marv is a boss-wanna-be. He gives advice, guides and bosses the ""weak"", unwillingly admitting that he is just a pawn figure in the criminal world. Near the end, we are aware the director has managed to ""trick"" us - there are many tiny plot twists based on our belief that the characters are one- dimensional and predictable.

He and his cousin, Marv(James Gandofini) run a mob owned, NYC neighborhood bar. The bar, once Marv's, is now a ""drop"" (as in the movie title) because the mob often parks its daily take there. Bob's life is complicated. He sort of watches over his cousin, Marv, who's still not happy about losing ownership of the bar years ago and still schemes foolishly. Bob also takes care of a puppy he finds in the garbage. Neighbor,Nadia(Noomi Repace), helps with the puppy, and slowly falls for Bob. Unfortunately the puppy's owner and Nadia's wacko ex-boyfriend, Eric Deeds(Matthias Schoenaerts), is not happy about this. The mob is also not happy after its money is stolen. What will Bob do?

This was also written by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, Shutter Island) so you know it has to be good right? Right.It reminds me a little of ""A History of Violence"" in that it builds the tension very nicely and you know that some where down the line violence is going to happen, but when, how and why?I am really sad that James Gandolfini is no longer with us, he is such a presence in the film. Tom Hardy is the best actor I can think of in today's era, I just buy into anything he is selling, he simmers here.After a summer of mindless action flicks, go see something with some meat, great performances and a great screenplay. This is a very good drama, well worth your $12.00.",The Drop

204,incubus67983,Intentional Ambiguity,10,12 April 2015,"This movie reminded me very much of the Clint Eastwood movie, Unforgiven. In both films the concept of the true nature of individuals and their attempts to live contrary to their true nature are masterfully laid out for the viewer. In The Drop, Marv fancies himself as a tough guy, yet he is unable to compete with the real gangsters who are true sociopaths. Deeds is really a coward who attempts to portray himself as a ruthless killer to be feared, yet in the end he reveals himself to be scared and weak. The real character study is Bob. We are given a hint early on when he rescues a puppy that one day will grow into a natural predator. This is no pet, this is young Bob being adopted and nurtured by the mature creature. Throughout the movie we are given Bob as a witless tool who relies upon Marv and stumbles with personal interaction. Bob is content living alone; living a quiet comfortable life, or so it seems. Then, in one of the most intriguing scenes, Bob shows his true nature as a pathological killer who callously puts two bullets into Deeds. When we see the gangster at the end of the movie come into the bar we know that only the physical structure of the bar separates the two. Bob is every bit the natural equivalent of the sadistic Chechen and makes him uneasy knowing that he isn't dealing with Marv any longer, but an equally dangerous adversary.This was an very well-cast movie. The acting is superb and the story is uncluttered. Noomi Rapace is great, no matter what she is in. Some may find certain ambiguities, but my sense is that the writer intended for the viewers to participate in the script writing and draw their own conclusions.",The Drop

Dennis Lehane had a great short story, but his inability to develop characters, create depth, and portray people as anything but borderline retards, has rendered the collective artwork useless with inebriated writing. I spent half the movie trying to figure out what mental problem Tom Hardys character had, but all it was was poor acting chops. Even Naomi Raprice gave a nauseating performance of a girl with ""no self and no depth"". It was like watching the best filmed ""stage reading"" by 2nd grade remedial class. Poor James G. - What a horrible way to end a well polished career. Don't waste your time. Go watch a move called ""The Lookout"" with Joseph Gordon Levitt.

207,arnoramon,The Drop - review by Arno Ramon - IMDb Score . 6.8,6,7 May 2015,"The Drop, starts fast progresses slow and remains slow.It tells the story of how organized crime masterminds shift from bar to bar to move large amounts of cash unnoticed.Main characters Bob Saganowski & Cousin Marv played by Tom Hardy & the late James Gandolfini work in a bar. Obviously this bar is going to be used for 'The Drop' by these organized mobsters.Side-plot is that Bob finds a beat-up dog in the trash of a lovely but troubled girl Nadia played by Naomi Rapace. Bob decides to take the dog in and develops feelings for Naomi. But then all-time badboy Mathias Schoenaerts who plays Eric Deeds shows up and stirs trouble in pretty much everybody's game.The Drop stutters along after that, and no real surprises happen.

It was low level guys just getting by and the whole time your waiting for the kettle to boil. It was gritty and the neighborhood felt alive. I loved Hardy's portrayal, he does not say much and comes across as a little slow but there is more than meets the eye. I like how the atmosphere develops and also how Lehane and Roskam had a good feel for the grimy world they are dealing with.The movie is a slow burn but worth the payoff in the end.

211,jantriska-63546,"A good, slow moving drama",8,26 July 2016,"I finally got around to watching this - and liked it a lot. The characters are compelling and they evolve, which is more than one gets in most crime thrillers. Gandolfini's 'Cousin Marv' is a complex, brooding man, who actually turns out to be a bad guy, worse than one would have thought. Bob is surprising and oddly likable; good choice to cast Tom Hardy in this role, as Hardy tends to do well in roles where he plays quiet types. (No one sees him coming, as the detective puts it, in one scene.) The Chechen gangsters are appropriately menacing but not over-the top, and appear to have some sort of a code of honour...again, a realistic portrayal of their kind. I liked the slow moving build up and the unrolling of the side stories (the dog rescue, the awkward friendship, maybe a hint of romance between Bob and Nadiya) and the almost complete lack of sensational scenes that seem to pervade many movies depicting organized crime. No car chases, no explosions, no epic shoot-outs. But the little bits of violence are pointed enough and scary enough to underscore the narrative. It almost feels like some of the British or continental European art films about a 'gritty' character in a bad neighbourhood, as opposed to the standard American fare about these subjects. Last but not least, even if I am not sure about the very premise of this film - not sure that the ""drop bars"" really function like this, in this day and age - I am ready to go with it, for the sake of a story well told.",The Drop

He rarely, if ever, disappoints me and The Drop was no exception.It's not an amazing movie by any means, but it does a lot of things really well. The tension in this movie is palpable. It just keeps getting more and more tense to the point where you're just gagging on it and want to find out what happens. I found myself shifting in my seat quite a bit. The dialogue is hit and miss, conversations between characters seem awkward at times. James Gandolfini gives a nice final performance as Cousin Marv. Noomi Rapace is fine here, but I could've used more to her character. I would've liked to see the relationship between her and Hardy have a bit more legs to it. Sketchy characters work around the periphery and when they enter they leave with a very unsettling feeling. The villains of this film walk around with an aura that screams something bad is gonna happen.Although the twist doesn't really pay off that tense build, it is very satisfying.This is just a really solid film that is worth checking out.

That's pretty much Tom Hardy, except there is no rags-to-riches tale here, and no attempt at showing ""The good nature"" underneath. He pretty much has the same blank expression and awkward social interactions with Noomi Rapace throughout the movie. Noomi plays the Eastern European woman he meets after rescuing a dog from her garbage can, whom, obviously, warms up to him, despite him having the charisma and social skills of your average glass paperweight. He asks her if she's named Nadia ""after the gymnast"". How would he even have known about Nadia Comaneci is beyond me, since it seems he cares about events outside his neighborhood as much as he does about quantum physics.Anyway, he works in a bar for his cousin (James Gandolfini), which has been taken over by Chechnyen mafioso. The bar gets robbed, they get threatened, and then all virtually takes a back seat to the Hardy-Noomi-Dog-Crazy ex-BF who claims the dog is his plot. The only reason you really care, especially if, like me, you dread any show of animal cruelty in a movie. You find out early on that James was involved in the robbery, and is plotting to rob the Chechnyens further. He is not the main character, and the way he is portrayed makes you can guess how he's going to end up soon in the movie. Even if it happens in a somewhat contrived way.The final twist, where we learn that Hardy is really a tough guy, and was responsible for killing the guy Noomi's ex-BF took the credit for, and disposed of the body, is hinted at by Gandolfini, so you know the revelation of his ""toughness"" is coming sooner or later. The dog is safe, Hardy gets the bar management from the Chechnyens, the cop detective know Hardy is a killer but is powerless because he has no evidence,Noomi can live with the fact he shot a guy in front of her, and the movie ends without any real impact in anyone's life.

221,jorisvaneil-143-494785,Okay. But failed to do what it meant to,6,28 June 2018,"It's impossible to substantiate my issues with this movie without spoilers, because my main issue is with the plot.Cinematographically it's all well done.
The acting, i wasn't too enthousiastic about, but that also had to do with the casting combined with how the characters were drawn.
It's weird, but i can only conclude that this just wasn't a role for Tom Hardy.He's meant to come across as this simple, morally relatively good man, who is later reveiled as the toughest killer of them all. But the problem is, Tom Hardy already has this air of moral ambiguity, of psychological depth around him, however simple a man he wants to portray. 
This largely undermines the effect of the beforementioned plot twist. I could just discern that the makers of this movie were aiming for it, but because of the kind of actor Tom Hardy is, however good, it doesn't work.The other way around, the guy who was supposed to be the real baddy, who turned out to be kind of a loser, also didn't really work. Again because this was all dependent on the turnaround that was supposed to originate from Tom Hardy's character. 
Without the effect of this twist, the movie never surpasses the level of a mediocre, slow, and even kind of boring crime story.Also, because of the focus on this battle between the protagonist and his enemy, which again failed to come across, the maffia boss was even less intimidating than he would have been were he the main antagonist. Same goes for James Gandolfini's character. That character worked way better than Hardy's part, but i feel he should have been the focus of the story. His scheming is barely more than a plot device for Tom Hardy's intended reveal, but at least he was on the same path all throughout the movie, and the audience could relate to his motivations. 
But now that Hardy was the protagonist, and we are supposed to relate to him, how can the writers expect to hide the fact that he was not wat he was portrayed to be in the beginning of the movie?It would have been better if we would have followed cousin Merv more, seen things from his perspective, most of all his dayly dealings with Bob, and suddenly get confronted with the real Bob. So in short, the movie is well made, but it fails plotwise, and it pains me to say that Hardy was simply miscast.",The Drop
222,appledreams4,One of the biggest surprises of 2014,9,5 January 2015,"I know that The Drop is good, but I never knew it is this good. Well, what initially attracted me to watch this movie I must say is the name Tom Hardy. Due to his previous works, I have grown to love this man as an actor, and he doesn't disappoint in The Drop. He portrays the movie's main character Bob Saginowski flawlessly, and successfully moulds ""Bob"" into one of the most complex characters. The Drop is not only a crime drama, it is more of a thriller. Though there are no sudden jump scares, or intense violent fights, but the movie still successfully creates this aura of suspense and thrill throughout the whole film, and one of the main contributors is the screenplay. The screenplay is written by the author of the short story which the movie is based on, Dennis Lehane, and it is extremely captivating. You will surely find yourself holding your breath right from the start till the end. And I'm not exaggerating here. And when the movie ends and the HUGE plot twist is revealed, you will see how amazing the screenplay is - the truth is obscured not because lies are constantly reinforced, but rather, the characters are written so cleverly and with so much complexity that it is our own reading of the characters themselves that led us to make certain wrong conclusions.Ultimately, The Drop benefits greatly from the excellent screenplay and the impeccable performance of the cast (mainly Tom Hardy and the late James Gandolfini).

226,mvillaprieto,A dog that bites never barks.,8,11 January 2015,"Michael R. Roskam is one of those directors who are concerned about each layer of the story that he's trying to tell and that works every detail with neatness and with the purpose of that, these last, turns into small pieces of extra information given to the spectator, with the intention to draw closer, with tension and patience, to endings that he, very well, knows how to treat. The drop is a film that you should hear, see, feel and interpret everything.Following the same line of his great first work (Bullhead. ), Roskam prints in a notable (as always.) Tom Hardy, a manly character of hidden pasts and intermittent violence that the only thing he wants is walking through life without further complications. This existence, in particular, is a sweet, clumsy guy that serves drinks in a bar that bears the name of his cousin, but that belongs to fearful Chechnyans, where the lives can do nothing more than get complicated. Supporting Hardy in a very good way, we find Noomi Rapace, the Belgian Matthias Schoenaerts and the late James Gandolfini who delivers a sublime, nostalgic, and final interpretation taken from his favorite niche.The Drop is a story filled with metaphors and concise small details that work together to reveal the violence that lies in every man, guided by the hand by a great and meticulous direction and a dark script made by a writer always faithful to his style (Dennis Lehane. ). Each shot which seems to have no direction, each red light that seemed to fall at random moments and each word that seems to be lost, are an element with a purpose or a symbol waiting to be discovered. With patience, coldness and care, the Drop stresses his year as one of the best films of the criminal underworld. Tom Hardy 2014. Locke: Very Super great: 10/10.

The strongest element in this movie is character development. And let me tell you, the characters are build in a beautiful way, from the way they talk, dress, walk and act to the way and place they live. Everything is done with so much detail. All the characters have more than one side and anybody can relate to them. Even the so- called villain has his valid reasoning. Very rarely does a movie make me not want it to end, but this one did. It kept me invested in it, interested, played with my feelings and made me question my morals near the end. You end up siding with someone that is more of an antihero, but not because of selfish or inconceivable reasons, but for very simple and maybe even laudable ones. The ending was very well made. It didn't show us the boy and girl getting married, kissing or anything like that. It showed us everything we needed to know without giving us the satisfaction. It made me want to see more. I can honestly say this is one of my top 10 movies of 2014.

236,mederao,Dark crime tale,8,21 November 2014,"I was looking forward for this for quite some time(you can read it as: forever). A crime drama with Tom Hardy and James Gandolfini(plus Noomi Rapace)? Fack yeah! I watched it yesterday and I'm not disappointed. It's a great pic. The movie starts with Bob Saginowski(Tom Hardy) monologue on the bar he works and how crime is involved with it. The shots are really riveting and dynamic and like the bar itself. Then we get to see that the bar is robbed, making the owners of the money confront Cousin Marv(James Gandolfini, rest in peace master)and Saginowski. And from this point on the plot makes the pace become really slow and dense, there's a lot of character development... and as well some unnecessary takes. The first act is really well developed, we get to see how well the actors are, making these characters really intense. The second act have us guessing and trying to find clichés on the plot... But the movie manages to escape crime movie's stupid paradigms. And the third act is really amazing, the catharsis is really well executed. The soundtrack is interesting. Silence is a priority on the movie, but when the score hits... It's well done. Cinematography is really unconventional as well... It gets to you with the gray and cold feel. The streets are so strangely aware of the indelicate sound of crime. It really adds substance to the tone of the movie. The acting is something that bothered me... The mob characters had great impact on the plot, but they're acts are so black and white... You can tell too easily who they are, and there comes the influence of other pics of the genre to this one. Except for Marv and Bob and the detective... The other characters didn't convince me, I felt it lacked substance... Maybe a little bit of poetry to their composition. Depise this fact, Hardy is really subtle... Well constructed and driven, we can tell his character had a dark past, and that's what makes him so calm. Sometimes you think his inept to that world. And Gandolfini, such intense acting... That man had acting chops... I can't believe this is the last time we'll see new work from him, it's sad. Great pic with a concrete storytelling... Interesting directorial work and amazing acting by the protagonists. I really wish it was more, there's was so much potential, there are moments that I felt it was too simplistic. One of the best pictures of the year and the plot dissolution is still in my head... Really awesome. Completely worth watching.",The Drop

Tom Hardy's character isn't believable. I've never written a review before, and I've gone out of my way to review on here and Netflix. I want to help you save your precious time in your precious lives. IMDb is making me write ten lines in order to leave a review. So here's a list of things that are better than this movie: Go Compare adverts, when the back of your mouth is itchy, hitting your elbow, queuing at the bank, standing in dog poo, losing your wallet, buying toilet roll, wi-fi not connecting, listening to a story about people you don't know, Alan Titchmarsh's chat show, trying to peel the sellotape of a parcel with something good inside of it, trying to find the end of sellotape, getting robbed, smashing your phone screen, making a PowerPoint presentation, writing an essay, coughing, listening to a dog bark, writing IMDb reviews.",The Drop

239,grossehannes,Excellent!,9,17 September 2015,"You must watch 'The Drop'.I always enjoy Tom Hardy, however it's my belief that Hardy does his best in the smaller productions where he has to reach a bit rather than having a lot handed to him like in the enormous, over the top - Fury Road.However, in the The Drop, Tom Hardy is terrific. You must watch and understand him in the time and space of Brooklyn of the 1980's, NY Giants mania, small pick-up trucks, as Tom tends bar in your classic neighborhood joint, so common to South Boston, Binghamton, or Ithaca.Tom is the Quiet Man to Cousin Marv's (Gandolfini) mouthy insouciance. They are the Odd Couple in the small establishment bar business. And the back and forth, especially over the dog, is well done. The old Gandolfini shows through in these short but meaningful exchanges and it is a shame that this was Jim's last film and that we lost him such a short time ago.Naomi Rapace is superb as the bird with the broken wing, while Schoenaerts is marvelous as the Noomi's former boyfriend who reappears at the most inopportune time.Watch 'The Drop', make your sandwich, grab your beers, take the dog for a walk, then watch, every minute is key!",The Drop

Except for the godlike ""Chechens"" who know all and pose an ineffable, horrifying, and oddly moral force, the characters involved are all downtrodden, losers, desperate. They're all dirty, not identifiable as good or evil, but survivors.Though it blatantly rips off Scorsese (watch those crazy camera pans as money slides across the bartop) it lacks the glamour of a mob film. It's more of a blue-collar noir. The backdrop is thrift-store basements, trash cans, back alleys, cast-iron fenced yards, a sports bar you'd recognize in any city.Some characters might strike you as being of too broad a type. The protagonist, who's just a bit too honest, too much of a boy scout. The psychotic wildcard. But this film's got some twists, and they're revealed with impeccable timing.",The Drop

It sets little periods of time aside to let the story and possible motivations of the characters it portrays to ferment in your mind.

245,Viced,A good movie that could have been great.,7,12 September 2014,"Michael R. Roskam burst onto the scene a few years back with ""Bullhead"" which was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In his first English language, American film, Roskam works with a script by the great author Dennis Lehane to tell the story of Brooklyn bartender Bob, waitress Nadia, has-been Cousin Marv, and the mysterious Eric Deeds. The plot of ""The Drop"" has been done before to various degrees, and Lehane's script was surprisingly predictable. Although the material wasn't particularly fresh, the actors and a few strong scenes make it worthwhile.Hardy, although a bit inconsistent, delivers a quietly great performance. You just want to give the guy a hug. Gandolfini is unsurprisingly fantastic in his final big screen performance. He plays to perfection a middle aged has-been that's ticked off with what his life has become. The direction they took with his character was predictable and left me very disappointed, but I'm happy that his last performance was this good. Noomi Rapace arguably gave the best performance in the film, and probably the best supporting actress I've seen so far this year. She does a great job playing a damaged woman trying to lead a good life, and her scenes with Hardy (and the dog!) are some of the best of the movie. Schoenaerts (who was sensational in Roskam's Bullhead) is good, but not given too much to do with a one-dimensional character. And the dog! Rocco! One of the all-time great dog performances in my opinion.The movie is also really funny at times (mainly Gandolfini in the first half hour and Hardy with the dog). It drags a bit at times, and like I said above the script could have been a lot better.... but it's still a very good movie that easily could have been a great one with a few changes. I'll still see it again, and I'm sure it will stay in my top 10 of the year.And as a huge fan of James Gandolfini, I'm sad to say this is the last time we'll ever see him on the big screen. But I'm happy that Roskam did him justice with one last great performance. RIP to one of the all-time greats.",The Drop

The film sucks you in with the character study often seen in every Dennis Lehane story. Tom Hardy, James Gandolfini and Noomi Rapace all give spectacular performances. But it was Tom Hardy who stole the film with the depth of his character Bob Saginowski, as well as Gandolfini as Cousin Marv. Also much like Dennis Lehane stories there is a strong twist and i have to admit this twist was better than Shutter Island's ""and that was a great twist"". With all the praise i give this film there is one minor gripe with the film, while the dialogue was well constructed it did tend to go a little ADD at times. But, that's a problem i can live with because the rest of the story is well constructed. Plus who doesn't love it when a cute pit-bull is a major plot point of the film.

Naomi Rapace is also very good in the movie as well as the other supporting actors. In terms of the story, we have seen many movies like this but The Drop flips the script a little bit with a great ending. The film can be a little predictable and cliché because of how many times we've seen this type of film. I wish the film would have been just a little more original and if that was true this movie probably would've gotten a 9 or higher.

251,martina4100,Slow burning crime thriller with a punch,6,1 January 2015,"Firstly, this is my debut review on IMDb. My preferred genres are sci-fi, horror, action, mystery and comedy. However, I have selected 'The Drop', a crime drama, as the subject of my first review.Before I continue, I would like to point out that I am by no means an educated film critic. I enjoy films, I rely on IMDb reviews to guide me, and I would like to provide my opinion in the hope that I can also assist others when selecting a film worthy of their time.I regularly find myself trawling through IMDb. Generally, I warrant any film with an average rating of 6 watchable; any film with a rating of between 6.5 and 7 I would expect to enjoy; and any films above 7, I would class as unmissable. Obviously, an average of at least 1000 reviews is essential.I refer to reviews before I watch any film and I look for specific information: reinforcement of the genre, script reviews and acting quality. I like a brief description of the plot but it is not essential as I feel that the information in available in the synopsis. All I want to know is if the genre is accurate (for example if it is a comedy, is it funny or not), is the acting good or not and is the script complete without plot holes. All of my reviews will include this information and my scores will be based on watchable, enjoyable and unmissable as stated above.So, lets review.Despite the 7.3 rating, 'The Drop', described as a crime drama, didn't attract my attention immediately due to some of the reviews describing the film as a character study. I expected it to be very slow, brooding, depressing and dull. The film was slow, brooding and at times depressing but certainly not dull.In line with other reviews, it is Tom Hardy's film and he is excellent; in my opinion, probably his best performance. He plays Bob, a bartender working at Cousin Marv's, a 'drop bar' run by Marv himself, played by James Gandolfini. Without giving much a way, the plot is essentially a character study of Bob and his role in the 'business'. I can't really say any more about the film other than that it is captivating which is mainly due to Tom Hardy's performance. Genre: Accurate. Definitely a crime drama but suspenseful. Acting: Excellent. Script: Thorough and thought provoking.As previously mentioned, I don't particularly like these types of films which is probably why I only rated it a 6. It is slow at times and without Tom Hardy the film wouldn't be so successful. His performance, a feeling of tension throughout (which at times is warranted but at others not so) and a very good and much needed twist at the end is what influenced my 'watchable' rating.If you like these sort of films i'm sure you will love 'The Drop'. If you are like me and prefer other genres you will still enjoy it and it is well worth watching so give it a go. If you like the format of my review please keep a look out for others in the future.",The Drop

It is character driven with a well written storyline. It does not have anything that would appeal to most movie goers....no car chases, moronic humor, or gratuitous sex. The Drop starts slow, but you have to pay attention to what goes on in the movie, and what the characters both do and say. It picks up speed and intensity, and is well worth your time.The storyline is a very interesting underworld crime caper, but it is very nuanced, with excellent acting by all the leads.

It is only after the last scenes when you observe Bob, the way he walks and his attitude reflects that he is a psycho. Well done and a movie to watch.

259,babsj902,A quiet movie with great characters,9,4 September 2015,"The protagonist in this movie, Bob, is played with intensity by Tom Hardy. Bob is a quiet, seemingly slightly slow, man who tends bar for his cousin Marv, played by James Gandolfini in his final performance. Bob seems slightly befuddled by life as nasty events and nastier people intrude into his quiet, lonely existence. Bob's sole companion in life is an abused dog he found in a garbage can, and he is almost overwhelmed at being responsible for its care.Gandolfini also turns in his usual excellent performance as a former tough guy whose life has taken a downturn. Also starring in the film is the excellent Noomi Rapace whose performance as the damaged Nadia is done with her usual understated perfection.Although the blurb I found on the TV guide led me to believe that this would be a violent action/revenge movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find it anything but that. It is a quiet drama about violent acts, but with little on screen violence. The tension was in the characters and their efforts to deal with the fallout from events and with each other.I strongly recommend this movie for those who appreciate great performances, intelligent films, and quiet dramas with characters with depth.",The Drop

Its all laid bare but still yo want to know how it pans out. Although there are some moments that are kept away from you, which come later and surprise you.

The bartender is a lonely guy who finds a dog in a trash can and meets a girl and forms a relationship with her. Bob the bartender gives drinks on the house and cousin Marv was not happy with that. And one night a group of thugs came and jacked the bar of its ""dirty money"". The Chechens actually own the bar. The former boyfriend of the girl Bob met is forcefully taken to go out with her on the super bowl Sunday night drop bar night so he can take the money. He was the guy that dropped the pit bull puppy in the trash in front of his formers girlfriends house. Then he was mad that Bob took his dog.

263,CSmithReviews,The Drop.,10,25 November 2014,"Wow. That's the first thing I said when walking out of the cinema after seeing this film.'The Drop' sets upon the story of Bob, whom 'just tends the bar' at a drop bar, in which the Chechen mob own. But when the bar is held up and some of the money goes missing, the film digs into the gritty past of family, friends and foes, and how they make ends meet.This film just keeps you on edge at ALL times, and with the film being based purely on dialogue, it does an overwhelmingly good job. It's a slow burn, but you get so engrossed into the characters lives that you feel they're a genuine person, walking the streets of Brooklyn. IT FEELS SO REAL DAMMIT!The acting is enthralling. Every actor puts in a stellar shift, no more than Tom Hardy, who shows again why he's one of the best in the business today, if not the best. With it sadly being James Gandolfini's last role, you feel that it send him off on a high, playing Bob's cousin Marv, who used to own the bar but seems to have deep seated issues about himself. Noomi Rapace and Matthias Schoenaerts also put in solid performances, and well, who can forget Rocco the pitbull now!HUGE props also go to Dennis Lahane for the screenplay in this film as it's near perfection. It's what makes this film seem so real and down to earth. And finally we can't forget Michaël R.

265,mail-200-255062,Tom Hardy's best yet.,9,1 January 2015,"You either like Tom Hardy or you don't. Like he did in Lawless, he plays the strong, silent, brooding character who immerses himself in his role. His co-star, James Gandolfini, is always watchable as a tongue-in-cheek, smirking, almost larger than life person. You're never sure if you can take him seriously. As for Noomi Rapace, my jury is out on her. I felt she had an easy role in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, and somehow lacks real 'presence' as an actress. The strength of The Drop is the atmosphere the film creates. It has real 'mood' and envelops you from the start. You're never quite sure who the good and bad guys really are, and my one criticism of the film is that, early on, it's easy to confuse the characters- especially in the half-light scenes- since many of them look similar with their unshaven chins. Nonetheless, this is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2014. As you watch it, you'll be engrossed in the plot- and sit there waiting for the denouement... Will worldly wise Marv (Gandolfini) resolve matters and ride the storm? Will quiet, ostensibly naive Bob (Hardy)suddenly explode into action? Can Nadia (Rapace)and Rocco (the dog)survive? This film is a must for all movie fans. It will raise Tom Hardy on to the pantheon, and remain as a lasting tribute to James Gandolfini. Tremendous!",The Drop

What a refreshing way to follow a very strong storyline but in a manner that is chill and seductive as the main character. I never watch a movie back to back much less twice, but this movie is one of my all time favorites. The story brings you along a path that is totally camouflaged. You cannot predict the ending.

It keeps going on and it starts to get boring after half an hour. It's not a mob movie ,not a gangster movie and not a real crime buster. The scene supposed to be in NY Brooklyn. Hardly any scenes show that it's actually there. The characters are well played by the actors and that's the only reason why I rated it 3 stars instead of 1.

269,piratezippy-46146,"A Real Smouldering Movie, YES IRECCOMEND IT",9,4 November 2015,"No Plot or Spoilers review Sometimes a movie, is giving the review of being slow, or slow paced. This is usually meant as a bad thing. In an age of fast action, special fx, more shots per minute than a real war, this movie is a Real Thriller. The pace is slower, this gives the characters the space and time to develop on screen. The benefit is the feel of a realistic thriller. I would put this film in a Rocky class of film, character and story driven. with a similar pace throughout, it smoulders to its conclusion in a well edited film to watch. Tom Hardy has become a talent that has really blossomed, and I have enjoyed watching him develop through the years. It can't be that long till I reckon he will win an Oscar, giving the right script/director. As Bob Saginowski, he is cold as ice, yet human and even endearing, he wills the audience to his side, and i can imagine a collective sign of 'hell yeah' at the critical moment. Noomi Rapace plays love interest Nadia Dunn. I loved Noomi since I watch the original girl with a tattooed dragon series, the best adaption of the books. Her performance is again human, real, and shows her character acting is better a lot of the Hollywood ladies. James Gandolfini in his last performance before his untimely death, plays the role to perfection. Again , full of character, and realism that is missing in a lot of films. If this film had be promoted better, I think it would have doubled its take. However, like great films, I was told by a friend, about this and watched it today, in the comfort of my couch. The photography is excellent, blending the backdrop of inner city bleakness, with the rich characters on the screen. well directed/edited to keep the tension throughout the movie. The menace just oozes out at times.definitely one for the DVD collection,",The Drop
