0,MartinHafer,To say this is a very dark anime is quite an understatement!,8,12 June 2016,"""Perfect Blue"" is a very, very dark anime...so don't let your kids watch it thinking it's like ""Pokemon"" or ""Inuyasha""! It's also a confusing mind-bending sort of film...one that certainly is unique.When the anime begins, Mima is in an up and coming pre-packaged Japanese girl bands. However, her agent convinces her to leave this life and pursue a career in films. But this way to success is very dark and soul-crushing and soon they have her in a film featuring a rape, lots of violence and nudity. All the while, Mima struggles with herself. She hates what she's doing but in the world of female pop stars and starlets, she feels a sense of obligation and won't publicly question the folks looking after her career. Now at this point, the film gets weird...really, really weird. Mima seems to be losing her mind and some murders occur...and soon the viewer is confused and they might be seeing the world through the eyes of a lunatic...or a killer! What's it all mean? See the film and TRY to unravel it all...but don't be surprised if you still are questioning what it all means.This is a very clever film and its plot is deep and very strange...and I liked that. But be forewarned...the film shows some very sexually explicit and violent scenes...even by Japanese standards (the film features pubic hair...something very taboo in Japanese culture). Well done and worth seeing...but just don't let the kids see it or anyone who have been sexually abused as a few of the scenes just might be too intense.",Perfect Blue
1,TheLittleSongbird,One fine anime!,8,27 March 2011,"I am a fan of anime and of animation, and I was very taken with Perfect Blue. I would have liked it to have lasted longer perhaps, that way more care could have gone into the ending which felt rather weak and rushed. But as a debut of a talented and interesting director, it is a fine anime not just of its genre but overall too.The animation is very good, while the backgrounds flow well and are wonderfully ethereal, the colours are well shaded and the characters look great without being too generic, it is the clever visual flourishes that really elevate. Another strong asset is the story, it is well paced but also in its tone it is wonderfully surrealistic and its ideas are interestingly presented.The music is fine too with some moments of beauty and some of it haunted me as well. The dialogue convinces and the pace is well-judged. All the characters are likable and interesting too, and the voice work is stellar. Overall, a fine film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Perfect Blue
2,kosmasp,"Perfect, blue or not",10,2 December 2020,"I have to admit, it took me too long to watch this in the first place. I was aware of the infamous nature of the movie, but never exactly to what degree. I did think this was more in the corner of Hentai (won't go into what that is, I'll leave that up to you), which was wrong thinking.This is horror (and I guess part drama) and quite the exploration of fame and what it does to some. What it is able to do to ones psyche. And very visually displayed. The lines are quite blurred between reality and fantasy. But the social commentary is not just vivid, but also very clear to see for everyone! I may have been missing on this for over 2 decades, but I found it and I do appreciate it very much",Perfect Blue
3,Tweekums,What is real?,9,17 April 2008,"""Perfect Blue"" is the story of Mima Kirigoe's transition from being a singer in a pop group with a squeaky clean image to an actress in racy murder mystery television series called ""Double Bind"".While she is willing to leave her old image behind it is clear that somebody will do anything to protect that image. People around her who are involved in pushing her further from her old self are murdered and she is directed to a web site that was made my somebody who clearly knows far too much about her to be a stranger.As things go wrong for her Mima starts to hallucinate, seeing her old self who keeps telling her that she should have remained a pop singer. Frequently we don't know if what we are watching is reality, an hallucination or a scene from ""Double Bind"". The film deserves a second viewing to help you understand some of the confusion... After seeing it a second time I raised my vote by one.While this isn't a perfect anime it is very good even though the animation is cruder than Satoshi Kon's later works; I suspect the rough look may have been deliberate. If you believe animation is solely a medium for children's films this will change your opinion, it is closer to ""Basic Instinct"" than it is to ""Bambi"".",Perfect Blue
4,BandSAboutMovies,Idol giallo,8,11 September 2021,"In her article 'Excuse Me, Who Are You?': Performance, the Gaze, and the Female in the Works of Kon Satoshi,"" Professor Susan Napier says that Perfect Blue ""...announces its preoccupation with perception, identity, voyeurism, and performance - especially in relation to the female - right from its opening sequence. The perception of reality cannot be trusted, with the visual set up only to not be reality, especially as the psychodrama heights towards the climax.""In effect, this Japanese animated film is a giallo, despite coming twenty years after that genre had its best efforts and being made 6,000 miles away.Mima Kirigoe has left the J-pop group CHAM! To become an actress on a detective show called Double Bind. Many of her fans are upset that she's left behind the innocent character that she had portrayed for a more adult role and some of her fanbase are not the young girls who traditionally love this style of music; Mima's fans are dangerous stalkers that send mail bombs and create websites that don't just describe her daily life but somehow her thoughts in way too knowing detail.As Mima's part in the show grows - including a graphic scene of assault that will destroy her clean image forever - she becomes increasingly disconnected from reality, obsessed with the website of her life and even seeing her past self.And then everyone close to her starts dying and the evidence points to Mima.Through it all, our heroine finishes the show and learns that her character has killed and assumed the identity of her beloved sister because of dissociative identity disorder. As the crew leaves, one of her stalks attempts to make the assault scene real under orders from the real Mima.So who is the real Mima? Does innocence have to be lost for us to move beyond our past? And how many times did Darren Aronofsky watch this? Not only did he take a scene directly out of it for Requiem for a Dream, he had to admit that there are similarities in his movie Black Swan.",Perfect Blue
5,Scarecrow-88,Perfect Blue,8,25 July 2007,"Very adult animated thriller about pop idol Mima trying to make it as an actress with a stalker(running a fictional supposed website faking thoughts she has amongst real actions she makes during each day)making her life practically unbearable. She is also tormented by her past success which seems to stalk her subconscious popping up into reality at times even foiling scenes during filming. The bubble-gum pop image is diminished when the young actress commits to a grueling rape scene in her first film. Soon she does a nude pictorial completely shattering the wholesome image she had been conveying for so long. The film shows the poor girl's decline in sanity as illusion and reality are blurred. Even the film she partakes in seems all too real to her present state in life. Soon those people(the writer of the script calling for the rape scene, the photographer which ""spoiled her innocence"", her agent asking for the young up and comer to commit to a new image)who the stalker holds responsible for the career change in Mima's life are being killed in nasty, vicious ways. The film offers the possibility that Mima herself may be committing the acts of violence with another personality converging to take over her body as revenge for the ""descent into immorality.""Full of bloodshed and nudity, this animated tale is quite heady displaying Mima's struggle to grip onto reality. I'm not sure I buy that ending which seems too much of a cop-out letting their heroine escape from being a murderer(..using another character jealous of her abandoning pop stardom for an acting career requiring nudity in seedy situations), but the film is quite a fascinating and entertaining mind-trip. There are scenes in the film where the tortured actress Mima is chasing her alter ego..and, the climax shows the alter ego supposedly trying to kill her(..this alter ego proves to actually be another completely different person).",Perfect Blue
6,morrison-dylan-fan,"My 2,500th review.",10,4 January 2021,"When discussing Black Lake (2020-also reviewed) during the online Cine-Excess festival, writer/director K/XI mentioned Perfect Blue. With Black Lake being my favourite release of 2020,I decided for my 1000th Letterboxd review, to discover how perfect this blue is.View on the film:Originally planned to be a live action direct to video film, but after the Kobe earthquake of 1995 damaged the production studio, the budget for the film was reduced to an original video animation, directing auteur Satoshi Kon makes the needed change into animation one that draws up a colourful ultra-stylisation, where the expressiveness of the hand-drawn Anime lines pencils in the fading line between reality and nightmare for Kirigoe.Performing on stage in the Pop group CHAM! From voyeuristic angles seen by the sold out crowd, Kon melts the vibrant colours of the smooth animation into a excellent study of perception and voyeurism, overlapping close-ups of Kirigoe expressive,smoothly animated face displaying a increased desire for maturity in her career/personal life, that is sharply contrasted by the stark, saturated colours that her obsessive fans/ voyeuristic managers gaze Kirigoe as being.Drawing from the live action origins,Kon stages the Thriller set-pieces with a incredible knife-edge atmosphere, thanks to experting performing tracking shots, whip-pans and razor-sharp jump-cuts slicing into the increasingly fractured state of Kirigoe's mind.Getting off the stage wanting to move into being a serious actress, the screenplay by Sadayuki Murai, Rika Takahashi &
Lia Sargent adapts Yoshikazu Takeuchi's novel with a astonishing sinking feeling, seeping from the early use of the internet as a plot device, with a website/blog called ""Mima's Room"" containing posts written from her perspective,that Kirigoe can not remember writing.As the online writings start to invade on her life, the writers superbly bind the exploitative voyeuristic treatment from fans/her manager, with the deepening fear gripping Kirigoe on the traumatic doubts gripping her view of reality being one that is increasingly far from perfect blue.",Perfect Blue
7,zetes,"Has some flaws and ends kind of weakly, but it's generally great",8,29 August 2010,"If you haven't yet heard, Japanese animator Satoshi Kon passed away earlier this week. He had four films, all quite loved, under his belt. Besides this one they include Paprika, Millennium Actress and Tokyo Godfathers (he was also the creative force behind the television series Paranoia Agent). Pefect Blue was the only feature I had not seen before, so I watched it in memoriam (I'll also be watching Paranoia Agent). I have to say, I like all of Kon's films, but none a whole lot. I have a problem with the animation and the drawings. The films kind of look cheap and they lack detail. They're certainly better than most television anime, but they certainly lag far behind Studio Ghibli. All four of these features have mind-bending stories, but they also all feel convoluted and ultimately unsatisfying.Perfect Blue is no exception, though it is probably my favorite of the four. It is about a young pop star, Mima, who decides to move onto an acting career. This ticks off her fans, especially after she does a nude photo spread and then willingly films an exploitative rape scene, sullying her virginal image. One creepy, stalker-ish fan in particular seems to take it all very badly. Meanwhile, Mami discovers a website that claims to be her own personal website. At first she assumes it's a crazed fan (possibly the stalker), but the shared details of her life are too intimate for anyone to know besides her. Is the stalker privy to her thoughts, or does Mima have an alternate personality, one that wants her to remain the pop star, that is trying to sabotage her? Soon the reality of the film begins to unravel and you can't quite tell what's going on.This split personality plot has been done to death in the past decade or so, but I guess in 1998 it was fairly fresh (we hadn't seen Fight Club and its ilk yet). Unfortunately, after a lot of fun with the twists and teases, it kind of deflates and ends with a sigh, never explaining what exactly is going on in that final half hour or so. I'm all for ambiguity, but this isn't a very controlled ambiguity. It's slovenly, and there just isn't quite enough information to form a coherent idea of what Perfect Blue is actually about. I still liked it a lot, but it definitely ends disappointingly.",Perfect Blue
8,christopher-underwood,There are times when you forget you are watching animation,8,7 August 2008,"Roger Corman is quoted as considering this a cross between Walt Disney and Alfred Hitchcock, whilst others have referenced Argento and Lynch. Whilst I'm not particularly keen on any of these comparisons, it is certainly true to say that this film, even though it is animated, is much closer to live action than what we normally consider animation. There are times when you forget you are watching animation, the urban shots of Tokyo are mesmerising, and I have certainly never seen so much blood in an animated film. I was going to say violence but I guess there is plenty of that in a Tom and Jerry short. This, of course, is much harder edged and although it begins in pink, girlie, teen idol territory it is not there for long and there are delirious sequences towards the end when it will not only be the person on screen who is having an identity crisis!",Perfect Blue
9,siderite,This could have been a regular movie instead,7,8 April 2006,"The script is very similar to a TV movie script or a police series episode, just a little better, bearing the hallmark of US films. I see no particular reason why this was made anime. The animation is not bad, but not great, either.The story is about a young pop singer who decides to turn actress, disappointing her more maniacal fans. Then it all goes on around the little frightened girl who doesn't now what is going on. She is left clueless for so long that the viewer gets bored. The end explains quite a few things, but not all of them.The movie does have the merit to show how the exploitation of teens in the media industry really abuses them, rather than pampering them. However, this doesn't make me feel better about all the singing bimbos acting on playback out there.Conclusion: decent anime, decent script, a bit boring, but nothing out of the ordinary. Anime, I think, should be about excelence and art, not mundane subjects such as this. I think I'm going to kill the producers :)",Perfect Blue
10,lost-in-limbo,Dreaming of real fame comes at a cost.,8,13 September 2006,"Mima Kirigoes is part of a young idol group Cham, but she decides to move on and kick-start a career as an actress with some help by her pressuring agent. To change her image, she accepts some confronting roles, which eventuates into her downward spiral between realities and virtual. She discovers an Internet site that knows her every move and those responsible for growing success in the acting industry end up brutally killed.Well, what can I say? Simply, I forgot that I originally saw this wonderfully, stunning anime picture before. I don't know how it left my mind, because it's very chilling and effective across the board. Based on Yoshikazu Takeuchi's novel, ""Perfect Blue"" is an intoxicatedly, shocking psychological thriller that does resemble some works of Lynch, Polanski, De Palma and rightly so, Hitchcock. Even a giallo imprint shines heavily within the mixture.The mature plot boldly plays it cards at a mild pace and eventually forms a structure like a rubrics cube. I wouldn't go out of my way to call it complicated, but there's stylish imagination and cerebral details that gladly doesn't fall into a convoluted mess. The characters' persona's are well defined and emotionally attachable. It can turn into an uncomfortable ride, where dazzling images of fact and fiction skews into one. You can't help but get those disorientating spells that the distraught Mima succumbs to on her journey to find her feet as an mature entertainer. Where her dreams become her anxiety, as she's too sensitive to how she's being perceived then being her true self. Her clean-cut image becomes tainted and a growing obsession towards her takes its tole on her fractured and vulnerable mind.Paranoia, delusions and a dreamlike air are cooked up with an array of tension and creepy visuals. The animation isn't a visual goldmine, but its showered with powerfully focused and flashed up images that manage to keep the viewer at bay. The pressure building dialogues are quite biting, and the revealing twist catches you off guard because of the superb use of artificial dreams with its fast editing and exhilaratingly moody soundtrack.You don't have to be a fan of animation to enjoy this piece. So, if you come across it, give it a chance.",Perfect Blue
11,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Genuinely disturbing.,8,19 October 2021,"'Perfect Blue (1997)' is genuinely disturbing, especially when it comes to its depictions of sexual violence. It features one of the most upsetting rape scenes I've seen (not that rape scenes are ever anything other than upsetting), even though the scene in question is framed as a consensual simulation, part of a television show that our protagonist, Mima, is filming. The flick also makes a nude photo shoot seem incredibly leery and violating, despite the fact that the shoot is, at least on the surface, entirely consensual. I say ""at least on the surface"" because the picture never makes it clear whether or not it is Mima's actual desire to do the things she is doing; as a fellow reviewer put it, she consents to these things simply because she doesn't know how not to. Although she constantly says that she chose to become an actress and, in saying so, implies that the horrors she faces are simply unavoidable consequences of that decision (which they should never be), she is never actually depicted as having chosen to be an actress at all; it's her manager who consistently reinforces the idea, with his reasoning seemingly being entirely based on the proposed profits of his decision. We don't know if she herself actually wants to do what she's doing or whether she has just internalised the wishes of others, in a similar fashion to how she internalises the public's hypocritical perception of her to the point that her true self is seemingly lost. In every instance in which Mima consents to being put in a sexualised, typically exploitative situation, she also subsequently expresses deep regret and experiences some form of trauma. Her life is entirely controlled by the men around her, from her all-male fans who leer at her while she's on stage and practically peer through her clothing yet chastise her when she actually shows some skin and expresses her sexuality to her manager who constantly excuses the exploitative situations he puts her in and even pushes for further scenarios in an effort to cement her position as an actress (a position which, again, he is entirely responsible for) to the stalker who watches her every move and impersonates her online in an effort to maintain the squeaky clean image he so desperately desires her to have. Everyone seeks to control her and she herself internalises this control as her own wants and needs. She confuses her true self with the self that other people want her to be, whether that's the innocent pop star or the grown-up actress. Her true self is arguably never seen on screen; if it is, it's whenever she is on her own, away from the public eye, and is able to reflect on her existence. Even the safety of her apartment soon becomes derailed, though. As her realities start to bleed into one another, so do the different elements of the film itself. It blurs the line between reality and the eerily true-to-life television show Mima is working on, between reality and the increasingly disturbing waking nightmares Mima is experiencing, even between reality and reality itself (it often presents us with situations that must be real to an extent, yet it does so in a deliberately confusing and, even, misleading way). The entire movie represents the crisis of personality at the heart of its tale. It brilliantly folds its conflict into its very fabric, trapping us within an uncomfortable and increasingly erratic headspace. You feel as unsteady and as icky as the protagonist, victimised by the plot's horrors and shaken by its mind-bending concepts. It's purposefully ambiguous, purposefully unsettling, as much a horror film as any other to use that label. Somehow, it's even scary in its most realistic moments; it doesn't need to make you question reality to make your skin crawl. I feel as though I'm not explaining it as well as I could be, because there's so much to say and it's so difficult to concisely do so (I'm also aware that I want to avoid major spoilers). This is a movie that practically demands analysis. Despite being animated, it's as real and mature as any film ever has been. It will seriously get under your skin. It certainly got under mine, and it's showing no signs of getting out any time soon. It's one of the few films I can recall that genuinely disturbed me. 8/10.",Perfect Blue
12,gbill-74877,A wild ride,7,31 October 2021,"Ah 1997, that time when a young woman needed instruction on how to access the ""world wide web"" using Netscape Navigator. This animated film seems awfully quaint in that moment, but then awfully prescient in some of the dark places it goes, such as cyber-impersonation and stalking. A squeaky-clean J-pop idol has decided to leave the group she's in to pursue a career in acting, but the transition is difficult for several reasons. She has fans who prefer she stay a pop idol, including a stalker, and there are people in the television industry who want to exploit her looks with salacious content, including her own agent, directors, and a photographer - stuff that's eaten up by leering men. The stress of it all makes her feel a mental schism as she tries to define her own identity, and she begins talking to an alternate persona and imagining things.The film is well-paced at 81 minutes and director Satoshi Kon constantly keeps the viewer guessing what's really happening here. We see scenes that seem like they apply to the woman's personal life, and then see they're part of the television drama she's shooting. We see scenes of her committing violence, and then those that make it seem like a delusion. This is where it dropped a little in my estimation, as I thought it relied too much on this kind of thing. The fact that how it resolves itself requires a second person to have a mental condition seemed excessive to me, and I thought it took away from the critique of the things women celebrities have to go through, which would otherwise have been more powerful. The ending was formulaic and weak, which was a shame. Just how creepy the film gets can't be denied though, helped considerably by an eerie soundtrack and frightening chase sequences. It might get a slightly higher rating on a re-watch.",Perfect Blue
13,sol-,Blurred Reality,7,11 April 2016,"A young pop singer tries to break out into acting, only to find that the psychological thriller that she is starring in has eerie parallels to her own life in this mind-bending animated drama from Japan. The plot here is rather challenging to decipher with reality and fantasy constantly blurring into one. It is also often hard to work out whether other characters are talking to her (or about her) in reality or in the film-within-the-film. While occasionally frustrating, this ambiguity is one of the film's best assets as it provides an insight into the thinking disturbed patterns of the aspiring actress and her deepest fears and insecurities. There is also a deranged stalker in the mix and an internet blog that claims to be written by her (but isn't). Also, in a personal identity crisis, she keeps seeing visions of herself as a pop icon, with the doppelganger claiming that the actress version of herself is not her real self. Director Satoshi Kon apparently only opted to animate the tale when interest for a live action incarnation began to wane, however, he manages to come up with such striking images that is hard to imagine the film having the same effect sans animation. There is an especially memorable bit in which the approaching headlights of a truck blur into stadium lights. The film also makes for a surefire curio nowadays with its insight into the early days of public domain internet where everyone could claim to be anyone.",Perfect Blue
14,briancham1994,Shocking and insane,9,29 July 2020,"I really had no idea what to expect from this film. I was familiar with Satoshi Kon's other works, but nothing really prepared me for the insane experience that is Perfect Blue. The line between sanity and insanity is completely shattered and the audience can never get a grip on what is real or delusions.

15,Rectangular_businessman,The first masterpiece of Satoshi Kon,10,3 October 2010,"Satoshi Kon, the genius animator behind incredible anime works as ""Tokyo Godfathers"" ""Paprika"" ""Millenium Actress"" and ""Paranoia Agent"" created a very own and unique style with ""Perfect Blue"", his first film, in which he he combines a realistic style of animation (At least compared with other anime movies and shows) with a surreal and dream-like plot, filled with mystery and unpredictable (But quite convincing) twists and revelations. Many people compared ""Perfect Blue"" with the works of the director of David Lynch. It is true that this movie shares some of the aspects of Lynch movies (Like the dreams within a dream) but i would say that it also had elements of the first films of Dario Argento and some of the works of Takashi Miike (Specially Audition) Despite being a pretty dark and disturbing film, it also has some bits of humor and sarcasm, something pretty common in the following works of Satoshi Kon. (Specially paranoia Agent, another of his masterpieces)""Perfect Blue"" is an excellent thriller, and it is much better than many live action thriller that I've saw. I would recommend this movie not only to the fans of Japanese animation, but also, for those who love (good) mystery and psychological horror.",Perfect Blue
16,TheMovieDiorama,Perfect Blue perfectly blends psychologically disturbed fantasy with grounded reality.,10,4 December 2019,"Mima Kirigoe. A pop-idol. An actress. An X-rated model. Public image and its personifying echoes circulate around the world, adhering to the desires of endearing fans alike. But when their inspirational idol haphazardly shifts career, from pop sensation to dramatic actress, the psychosis of the modern consumer society ultimately changes with her. Saddened, angered and crazed. Mima's abrupt persona altering career move may have developed maddened stalkers, including her fantastically imagined past self haunting the newly suppressed version.The late Satoshi Kon was known for seamlessly blending fantasy with reality. Depicting an opaque blurred line between delusions and actualities. None more so, than in his exaggerated psychologically disturbed work in Perfect Blue. For many the art form of Japanese animation, commonly titled as ""anime"", is cited as ""childish"". ""Anime is for losers"" tweeted kickboxer Andrew Tate. Well, if like Mr. Tate you believe anime to be childish, I implore you to watch Perfect Blue. Without illustrating the voyeuristic nature of Murai's narrative, it is the most accessibly invigorating piece of psychological stimulation, that is strictly aimed towards adults, to ever be constructed from this art form.The complete metamorphosis of a character that questions her own perceived identity through inquisitional explicit acts of graphic nature. Exploring the psychosis of shared delusional disorder and the acute harassment of an obsessive stalker. Kon establishes a murder mystery whilst inciting the emasculation of a vulnerable female's world. Male controllers, likened to manipulative deities of authoritative powers, are gradually weakened by a mysterious individual. Culminating into a twistingly fragmented climax that grants Mima the independence that she was repressed from.Kon's intelligence in foreshadowing, the drama series 'Double Bind' essentially replicating Mima's regressive state of mind, allows the audience to question several aspects. He smartly manages to maintain the central mystery without deterring from Mima's mental instability. He doesn't stop there though. Kon refuses to relinquish thematic presence in every frame. Exploring the fragility of a rape victim and the traumatisation of such an explicitly heightened ordeal. The dangers of online anonymity and the tarnishing of existing careers. Challenging the extremities of art in all its mediums. The realism of Perfect Blue is what forces its story to be so utterly terrifying. It's not just a psychological thriller. It's horror.Kon's signature animation style is gloriously vibrant as always, with attentive detail towards realistic environments. The grotesque facial features of ""Me-Mania"", only possible in this art form, heighten the natural malformed detest we have for him. Ikumi's audacious score enables the heart to palpitate more frequently with its sharp tones and ethereal voices. And, as rare as this is, the English dub is surprisingly decent.The reality is that Perfect Blue transcends the medium that it is presented in. It stimulates through Kon's trademark visceral style, allowing the dangers of early Internet culture to produce a thrilling psychologically adept feature that blurs fantasy with reality. I mean, for a film to make me stand up, clap my hands and utter the words ""perfection"", it has to be something special right?. Well, Perfect Blue is special, because it is perfect. And yes, with that said it does indeed garner the perfect rating. Quite possibly the best anime feature to ever be released.",Perfect Blue
17,SAMTHEBESTEST,A mind-shaking psychological thriller from Japanese Cinema sets benchmark for Animated Films,8,28 July 2020,"Perfect Blue (1997) :
Brief Review -A mind-shaking psychological thriller from Japanese Cinema sets benchmark for Animated Films. Perfect Blue shows how to to make a perfect mind-blowing thriller to world cinema irrespective to whether it is animated films or motion pictures. It set the benchmark for animated film but even if i have to look at it in comparison to the feature films, it still is freaking brilliant thriller. In 90s Hollywood gave some brilliant psychological thrillers like 'The Silence Of Lambs', 'Fight Club', 'The Sixth Sense' and lately 'Shutter Island' where we keep guessing what is real and what is not. Perfect Blue has that real and fantasy worlds confusion but it also uses them logically by adding medical terms like Psychological disorders and multiple persona in illusional World. In just 80 minutes this film covers all these things without making a single moment look useless and that's why i was glued to the narrative and couldn't predict much before i met the climax. Director Satoshi Kon tells this story in complicated manners just to test the IQ level of audience by making all shots continuesly linked to the illusions yet in reality. It never gives you a chance to predict something because whatever you assume just fades away in the next scene as you realise your theory was wrong and we're up for the next one subsequently followed by another wrong assumption. In all this intricate carvings the interest and curiousity are never lost hence making it a powerfully tightly made thriller. I strongly recommend this film to everyone because it will show you that how matured you are as an audience and how much do you really understand films so get yourself tested with this Classic Thriller and do not hesitate to watch it again and again if you don't get it. Overall, one of the finest thriller in the history of animated and non-animated World of Cinema.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Perfect Blue

19,Vartiainen,Intense and uncomfortable fear,8,28 January 2021,"Acclaimed anime director Satoshi Kon's debut feature film. A story about a young pop idol named Mima Kirigoe (Junko Iwao) who tries to transition into a movie star. But when an obsessed fan starts stalking her and the movie studio wishes to use her more for her sex appeal than her acting talent, things turn sour.The film is most often called a psychological thriller. And while that is the most obvious category, I'd argue that the film almost slips into a supernatural horror film from time to time. And it's in that genre where the plot seems to make the most sense. Satoshi Kon has always been a loose storyteller. His plots are often told through hallucinations, fever dreams and straight up nightmares. Likewise here. It is implied that Mima starts to undergo a mental breakdown, which explains how the film jumps around with very little rhyme or reason. But it's almost too much. I'm sure that there are those that don't like this film because it's so hard to keep up with it and because you're unsure as a viewer how much of what is happening on the screen is supposed to be real.It's also a very sexually loaded film. It's not quite erotica, but it's the next best thing and in a very dark way. There are scenes in this film that are genuinely difficult to sit through. Which plays to the film's strengths, but can also be a deal breaker for some viewers.All in all this is a very impressive debut film. Intense, creepy, unnerving and loaded with implications. A film you'll end up thinking about for days after you've seen it.",Perfect Blue
20,hellraiser7,Identity Crisis,10,25 July 2012,"I always found the fundamental problem with admiration of celebrities as well as the concept of fame itself is that we tend to fail to see them for who they really are as a person. Which is why I can never really say that I know that person, sure I might see them on the silver screen or an interview or two but I've never shared dinner with them nor hung out, so I honestly don't really know them.Perfect Blue is I feel one of the best if forgotten anime. This film was the late great Satoshi Kon's debut in the anime world and it's a great start for him, this film is a beautifully crafted thriller that plays out almost like a Hichcock thriller, in those thrillers it's always about a innocent person's world turned against him/her and they become isolated with no one they can really trust to help them.The animation in this film is great to me it's one of animes best examples because it was doing something that anime still isn't doing much of or wrongfully steering aways from which is realism and unconventionality. One of the things I love about Satoshi Kons work is he's always doing something different every time and avoids all of those anime cliché's like explosions, mecha and all the other familiar goodies I've seen one time too many, this film has none of those things here he's playing things straight out no gimmicks. Also the style and direction of this anime doesn't even feel like an anime at all but actually felt like I was watching a live action more, and it's all because of the films sense of realism, that's pretty trippy but that's the point. The music is great I like the pop songs but I mainly like the eerie dark tune we hear, which really sends chills down your spine.Satoshi's trademark has been utilizing the technique of blurring reality and fantasy together, much like with Gilliam's ""Brazil"" or ""Jacob's Ladder"". We're literally in the main character's perspective, at time it feels like were seeing reality but then it pulls the rug from under us and we then rethink about our earlier perception. Like for example that TV show Mimi is in, the case their working on is very ironic to the situation Mimi is in, in those scenes at time I couldn't help but wonder if the show wasn't actually a show but that was the reality and Mimi's acting career is the illusion. There are many other moments that can really mess with you but I wont' give them away you have to experience it yourself. Thsi makes the film all the more intense especially that revolving subplot which adds to the atmosphere with the crazed fan whom conducts a rather creep website called ""Mimi's Room"" which is a site that gives away details of her everyday life, some actually ring true to Mimi's psyche. In a way this really hits home because this is a real issue and fear that most celebrates have where there are those fans who's elevator's really don't go all the way to the top and they take it way too far; these are people that live ""As if"" lifestyles where they feel there lives are so empty they have to disconnect with reality and make it based on admiration of something else in order to fill that hole, these kinds of fans creep the hell out of me.The film those is also a character drama where we see Mimi and can't help but feel a sense of pathos for her. The whole film is mainly about identity and the subconscious fear of losing it as one changes. Mimi we see is a young, sweet, naive, vibrant person who as we see like any player in the entertainment game desires to go further and become a big name. But as we see further in the film things aren't going the way she wants them to, like the fact that she has to do things she doesn't want to do or ever is limited to others, this is a common things with all actors and actresses there are highs but there are also lows that can severely hurt, times like that really make me a little concerned for them and wonder if their really alright but also actors and actresses out of the lime light. We even see at times whether she wants to admit it or not that the band she's broken up with she actually does miss it when she sees when she's separated they've became more popular than before as well as her friendship with the two, this makes her wonder if being an actress is what she really wanted at all or was she deluding herself to run away from who she really is. With these factors as well as the subplot involved she begins to feel the pressure and fall into a spiral state of despair and depression where she begins to lose her sense of self and nothing feels real.Illusions can't hurt you but reality can kill you if you can't decipher the difference between the two and yourself.Rating: 4 stars",Perfect Blue
21,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,30 April 2019,"I caught this in High School and it instantly took me as an eerie Alfred Hitchcock show that did an outstanding job of feeding on pure paranoia.It was unsettling, it was scary, and at the time it seemed as realistic as it could be for an anime movie.As I rode through it, I started doubting what was real and what wasn't and that is a hallmark of a great movie, that ability to keep the viewer on their toes.",Perfect Blue
22,Polaris_DiB,"Despite a few annoying ""Oh it was only a dream!"" misdirections, still a strong surrealist movie",8,5 April 2009,"From master anime director Satoshi Kon comes another surreal fable dealing in dreams, technology, and pop culture. Mima leaves the J-pop group she was a member of to focus her career on acting, but with that comes the pressure of disappointing her fans and the anxiety of possibly not succeeding. These culminate--along with a stalker fan who looks like Sloth from the Goonies, a photographer who takes lewd pictures, and a rather surreal plot in the television drama proper she's working in--in a mysterious presence that claims to be her but seems out to kill her. And dreams.I tend to resist putting the label ""Lynchian"" on things that share a surreal or multi-identity subject, but here it fits. Perfect Blue shares a lot of thematic and stylistic approaches as Mulholland Dr. and Inland Empire, and the ways that Mimi would respond to a character only to find that she's on stage acting for the television drama could easily have been inspiration for Laura Dern's work in the latter. Perfect Blue would probably be a great way to get Lynch fans into anime.As for Satoshi Kon, this is a pretty standard example of his work, which is a good thing. Animation is especially set for the surreal because of its movement, though Kon has always been good at minimizing the graphic strangeness to key moments and letting the rest reside in the plot and drama, a better choice in the long run because it resonates. Things in this movie have already aged, though. No actress today would even have a chance without being familiar with social networking sites and blogs on the Internet, for example. Considering the way in which Mimi's anxiety somewhat helps create the monster, anyone who likes this movie would do well to watch Kon's miniseries, Paranoia Agent.--PolarisDiB",Perfect Blue
23,dee.reid,"""Perfect Blue"" - Talk about a mind-bender!",10,31 August 2021,"(This is my 501st review on IMDb.)In an era where the total mind-bender is limited to painfully obvious plot twists and so-so/lame narratives that think they know everything and can easily fool the audience, ""Perfect Blue"" comes at us from one of the last places we ever expected: Japanese animation, otherwise known as Anime'.""Perfect Blue"" blends elements of the psychological thriller, the horror film, the adult-entertainment film and other dramatic themes so that in the end, it seems to play out as a head-on collision of each genre. The central character of the film is pop idol Mima Kirigoe, who opts for a career change following her much-maligned departure from her all-girl teeny-bop singing group ""CHAM!""This sudden change upsets her fans, to say the least, and pretty soon those around her start receiving threatening letters and such, and some are even later horribly murdered. To top things off, Mima seems to be losing her grip on reality, a slip into insanity brought on by her newfound actress role on a brutally violent television series. And she seems to have two different stalkers, one real and one phantasmal. The first is the typical obsessed fan. The second has her hounded by a specter of her alter-ego who claims to be the true, squeaky-clean Mima, and it's all really only the beginning of forces that are ultimately out to claim her sanity.""Perfect Blue"" comes to us from a team of filmmakers at Manga Entertainment who really know their stuff about playing tricks on the mind. It's from director Satoshi Kon, based on the novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi. ""Perfect Blue"" does contain some of the obligatory fashion elements of most Anime', not limited to extreme violence and graphic sexuality/nudity. But in actuality, this is the first animated film from Japan to find a useful purpose for things that would otherwise set off red flags. For example, it is after Mima's on-screen rape that things suddenly begin to really take a toll on her mental state.Also like most Anime', ""Perfect Blue"" benefits greatly from a rich and lavish visual style that complements the animation greatly. The film's narrative works because of its ""movie within a movie"" theme and dream-like atmosphere, a setup that's been done to death in most live-action cinema, but seems to take on a whole new dimension in Japanese Anime'.""Perfect Blue"" is, in summation, an Anime' film that quite simply is not like anything else out there. Although it does end on a note of optimism that mostly (and carefully) explains everything, I just dismiss that as hardly anything hurtful from the mind-bender experience. Lastly, the title is at least partially accurate with regard to its content: it's perfect.(On a personal note, I would like to think that some of today's pop ""princesses"" could learn a thing or two from ""Perfect Blue,"" just so you know.)10/10.",Perfect Blue
24,MissSimonetta,Terrifying and profound,10,13 April 2020,"Mima Kirioge is a pop musician who decides to break into acting. This choice is not met with support from just about everyone in her life: her manager wants her to go back to music, her fans are confused, and one mega-fan in particular starts sending her death threats and apparently stalking her, posting things only Mima could know on an online page. These threats escalate from words into action, combining with Mima's own inner demons to send her to the edge of insanity.There's a lot to unpack with this movie: how people think they ""own"" celebrities, how women struggle in industries obsessed with looks and sex appeal, the burgeoning dangers of social media, etc. The amount of nudity in the film is about as disturbing as the violence-- not for any prudish reason, but because it is clear Mima does not want to have to take off her clothes for cameras-- it's yet another way the media wants to control her. The cameras and audience become invasive and cruel. Mima is constantly having her image controlled by someone else: Rumi and Me-Mania want her to stay virginal and sweet, the TV producers and the media demand a more aggressively sexualized image. Both of these identities are ones Mima only takes on reluctantly; she's too much of a people pleaser to rebel as she tearfully admits. In this way, the rape motif (both in the film-within-a-film and during Me-Mania's final attack) becomes less a source of shock value and more a metaphor for the domination all these forces want to exert on Mima-- her body, her identity.As a fan of horror movies and thrillers, I can say PERFECT BLUE is among the most intense I have ever seen. And one need not be an anime fan to enjoy PERFECT BLUE. Its mind screw plot, harrowed heroine, surrealistic imagery, and violent atmosphere make it feel like the love child of David Lynch and 70s era Brian De Palma. It's astounding how many Hollywood movies in the 2000s and 2010s have liberally taken inspiration from it (looking at you, BLACK SWAN).",Perfect Blue

26,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Giallo Anime Film,9,18 April 2019,"This was a film that I heard about from some horror movie podcasts I listen to. One of the hosts really championed this film and he talked so passionately about it, that I decided to check it out. The synopsis is a retired pop singer turned actress' sense of reality is shaken when she is stalked by an obsessed fan and seemingly a ghost of her past.We kick this off a performance of a pop group in Japan, CHAM. We learn that one of members, Mima Kirigoe (Junko Iwao), is leaving the group to pursue a career in acting. Things are thrown off a group of hoodlums who showed up another show start to cause a ruckus. They get into it with a super fan of the Mima's as well.Mima has a tough go at first with the change of career. She isn't given a big part and she is hearing a lot about how she should probably have stuck with singing, in part of this from her manager Rumi (Rica Matsumoto). Her super fan is also very upset and is stalking her.Her agent gets her a bigger part, but it involves her being raped on camera. Mima agrees to this, but we see after the filming, it really bothered her. She starts to descend into madness though when Rumi shows her a website about someone posing as her. She gets a threatening fax calling her a traitor and a letter bomb that her agent is attacked with.It is when those around her that have wronged her or made her do things that she really didn't want to do start to die. Mima doesn't know what is real and what is in the show. Is she killing these people or is it this odd looking guy following her? She delves deeper into the persona on the site of her and she is doesn't know if she is real or just an imposter herself.Now I'm going to keep this short, because to be honest, this film is pretty trippy and hard to keep straight and I also think it is something that should be seen as well. I found this story though to be great. I wasn't really sure what I was getting into, as I haven't seen any horror anime from my recollection. I have to say though; this interpretation of the Italian giallo was very well done. It really poses who is the killer, Mima or the super fan stalking her, but it goes beyond that. The descending into madness is really enhanced by it being done in animation. That was something that really blew me away.Something I really wanted to delve into a bit more though is the idea of celebrity and who we are. Clearly, I'm a no one who has a small internet following. Even someone like me had an identity crisis after college and wanted to kind of find a purpose. This led me to some anxiety and depression and it really is writing these reviews that gave me a hobby that I'm pretty proud of. Now amplify that by 100x. Mima is a pop idol. Her group is super popular and she decides to become an actress. In doing so loses her identity. When she sees someone posing as her online, she doesn't know what's real or what isn't. This goes to kind of like in American Psycho where we really don't know each other or even ourselves. Even worse is for celebrities, because we give an idea of what we think they are and that is what we get in Perfect Blue.Something I kind of alluded to would be the editing of the film, which is absolutely amazing. The duality of the story of the movie that Mima is in to what is happening in her life is great. She doesn't know if she is the killer, she doesn't know who is she and even what is real. We hear the director calling take 2 and she is back in her room for a second time. It is disorienting, but just really adds to the film. I was hooked and never lost interest trying to figure out what is going on here. There was also a solid reveal at the end of the film that I thought was prefect as well.Acting is something that is really hard to judge for an anime. I did think that all of the voices were perfect for the characters. I really have to commend Iwao as a majority of it is her. The rest of though definitely did a solid job for sure in bringing the characters to life.What I really need to talk about would be the effects, or in this case the animation. I spoke with my dad in the past about how horror would be interesting in this form as you really take off the limitations to what you can show and do. This is like watching a legit film. There is nudity and some of the death scenes are pretty violent. I was actually impressed with that.I have to give a lot of credit to the soundtrack as well. There were a few moments where the music got really intense and I could feel my anxiety going up. It really fit the scene to help to build the tension that they needed for it. I thought the j-pop style music that was used at times when CHAM was being shown fit and the rest of the score did for what they needed overall.Now with that said, I was really blown away by how good this was. It really has such a complex story that is hard to talk about, but it really unfolds itself and gives us a very good ending. The deeper meanings I got out of it of finding oneself and how celebrities aren't necessarily what we think. The duality of what is happening compared to the film that is being made is great as well. I thought the animation was really good and how much like a regular film is outstanding. The score really adds on an extra layer to it. Now will warn you, this anime is from Japan, so I watched it with subtitles on. If that is an issue, I'd avoid this. If not, I really thought this was a solid horror film with deep, dark story.",Perfect Blue

Wow. Just wow. You need to go into this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. I was just told to check this out because I love trippy types of films that f with your headspace. It is about a pop singer who is transitioning into becoming an actress and crazy sh#t begins to happen. At first I felt like a pervert watching this because you're basically watching a girl run around in a short skirt for two hours but after the crazy stuff starts kicking in and you're required to start figuring stuff out, you'll see there is a method to ever inch of this movie. If anyone can message me and tell me if that is the real her at the end, I would much appreciate it. I swear that isn't her but I just don't know. I'll have to watch it again.

28,lewiskendell,One of the best anime thrillers that I have seen.,7,29 January 2016,"I usually pride myself on figuring out the twist or ending of a thriller long before it's formally revealed, but I'm proud to say that Perfect Blue kept me in the dark right up until it was ready to divulge its secrets. Anyone who likes anime and is looking for a good mystery will fall right in love with Perfect Blue.It's difficult to give much of a sense of what the film is about with spoiling the plot. But essentially, its about a Japanese pop singer named Mima who leaves her musical group and decides to become an actress. She's not entirely happy about the things that she's forced to deal with in her new career, and she starts experiencing odd hallucinations as people around her start to die in brutal ways. This is definitely an intense movie, and some of the scenes are very violent. It's nothing that a fan of action anime hasn't been exposed to before, but it bares mentioning anyway.I thought the pacing was a little slow at the beginning, but this pays off well once the story gets going, so maybe that's not too big of a deal. The art style leans toward realism in a very pleasing way that aids in telling such a serious story. I'm sure that there are not very many serious anime fans that haven't seen Perfect Blue, and with good reason. It's an excellent thriller that surpasses many of the live-action movies in the genre that I've seen recently.",Perfect Blue
29,sme_no_densetsu,A fascinating study of perception & idol worship,9,10 December 2017,"""Perfect Blue"" is a 1997 anime about a young woman transitioning from a career as a pop idol to a new vocation as a serious actress. She finds that the metamorphosis is not an easy one when she tackles a sexually charged role that upsets her fans. One such fan appears to be stalking her, while her own doubts about this new direction take a toll on her psyche to the point that the line between fantasy & reality begins to become blurred.Produced on a miniscule budget of three million yen (approx. $25,000 in U.S. dollars), it must be admitted that the movie shows its limitations at times in the animation. That being said, while the visuals aren't exactly elaborate, they're consistently kept fresh with interesting directorial choices and dexterous editing that alternates between fantasy & reality with ease.The narrative is, to a certain degree, purposely difficult to follow, particularly as the movie progresses and the protagonist's state of mind begins to deteriorate. However, I found it to be adequately comprehensible on my first viewing. I wasn't entirely convinced by a late twist that seemed to come out of left field but I found that it made more sense on a second viewing.The story combines well-executed elements of the psychological thriller genre with a finale that ventures into more operatic territory reminiscent of Italian giallo. One or both of those approaches may not appeal to all viewers but I find that the movie's overall success as a psychological thriller may actually be overshadowed by its exceptional depth. This is a movie that's filled to the brim with astute observations on perception, idol worship and the nature of reality.This, I feel, is what elevates ""Perfect Blue"" above most anime movies (and most live action movies, too, for that matter). While it's unlikely to appeal to everyone, if you're looking for a smart and effective psychological thriller then ""Perfect Blue"" is well worth your time, regardless of any preconceived notions that you may have about anime. Sadly, the director (Satoshi Kon) succumbed to cancer at the young age of 46 but not before producing four distinctive anime films, of which this may be the finest.",Perfect Blue
30,Maciste_Brother,Good but not great Anime,6,15 April 2003,"I like some of the animation in PERFECT BLUE. Some scenes were very stiff but other scenes were beautifully rendered without being too flashy. The problem with PB is the story. It has too many implausible details like the killer being able to look like Mima, the popstar. I mean, come on! They might get away with it because it's animation but it would be impossible to recreate this in a believable fashion in a live action movie. It feels like a cheat. The only way this implausible detail could have been possible is that the killer has some sort of psychic link with Mima. Otherwise, I just can't see it as being remotely plausible. But even the idea of the killer having a psychic link with Mima can't explain the scenes were we see the killer without Mima being around, like the ""pizza boy"" scene. The fact that the killer looked like the ""pizza boy"" during that scene really doesn't make any sense at all. Also, the fact that a popstar quits her group because she thinks the image of a pop idol is suffocating her is a tad ludicrous in this case because CHAM are almost unknown and have never had a top 100 hit when Mima was part of it! Now how suffocating can that be? The story would have made more sense if CHAM had been popular. PB is filled with violence and nudity and a simulated rape scene, which makes this a DEFINITE R-rated anime, even though everything else looks like something straight out of SAILOR MOON. What's also interesting is how they completely leave out the idea that Mima can have a boyfriend or even friends. Leaving the pop band doesn't mean Mima can't be friends with the other members of CHAM.Anyway, the film is entertaining and it does have some spooky qualities that make it really interesting. But it's a tad overrated. I give it 6 out of 10.A couple of points:Am I the only who thinks that the ugly creep was made to look like Michael Jackson?The first song CHAM play at the beginning sounds a lot like that song from the French band, 2be3.",Perfect Blue
31,IonicBreezeMachine,Satoshi Kon's debut feature near masterfully blurs the lines of dreams and reality in story that dives into the darkest corners of celebrity and sanity.,9,1 May 2021,"Mima Kirigoe, a Japanese Pop Idol, is torn between her agent Tadokoro and manager Rumi over the direction of her career and image. Tadokoro wants to transition Mima to acting while Rumi wants Mima to cultivate her Mimarin Pop Idol person. Mima decides to transition to acting and is given a role in a trashy exploitative psycho thriller called Double Bind. The strain of the violence and sadism in the series is strenuous enough, but when Mima discovers a fansite called Mima's Room she begins to fear someone is watching her and visions of her former persona mocking and chastising her blur the lines between reality and illusion.Based on the book, Perfect Blue: Complete Metamorphosis by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, Perfect Blue was originally intended as a series of live action direct to video thrillers before a 1995 Earthquake damaged the studio and reduced the budget for a Original Video animation. The film became Satoshi Kon's first directorial effort following his acclaimed writing for the segment, Magnetic Rose, in the anime anthology film Memories. While based on a novel, Kon and screenwriter, Sadayuki Murai did not feel the book would work as a film and were giving the blessing to change it so long as they kept the original framework. When the film was sold abroad, it piggybacked off the name of Katsuhiro Otomo of Akira, who was credited as a ""special superviosr"" and the film became widely known and helped jump start Sotoshi Kon's directing career. Perfect Blue is a film where you can definitely see the foundations for Kon's signature style even if there is some roughness in the initial foray.Kon introduces us to the world of Perfect Blue masterfully as he contrasts the busyness and flash of Mima's stage persona with the emptiness and isolation in Mima's apartment. Throughout the film we see the contrast between the vulnerability and insecurity Mima shows in private and it's contrasted with the carefully scripted and choreographed interviews and media appearances where she's essentially selling an image. We also see the psychological strain Mima goes through as the glamour shoots and sleazy sexualized violence she simulates in her TV series take an emotional toll as Mima experiences a loss of identity and terror and violence in her TV role becomes intertwined with the very real murders and stalking that affects her and those around her. Not only is Perfect Blue an exhausting look at celebrity status with its commentary on the loss of privacy, identity, and adopting a persona to cater to the whims of a fickle public, but it's also an engaging murder mystery where we can't be sure who or what is a clue due to a potentially unreliable narrator. It's a near perfect thriller that will catch even the most seasoned thriller buff off guard.The one drawback I'd say the film has is in its ultimate resolution. Without giving too there's a twist and I think it's reasonably well established and revealed but once we get passed the twist the movie has a wrap up that doesn't tonally align with the previous 70+ minutes of events that preceded it. While I don't object to how it ended on principle I feel that it was too neat and clean in terms of wrapping up what is a very dark and disturbing story.Despite my misgivings regarding the ending, I feel Perfect Blue is a must see not just for fans of Satoshi Kon but animation in general. Perfect Blue is a movie with ideas and themes that are adult in nature but they never come off as trashy or exploitative and it gives weight and gravity to the psychological hell inflicted upon our protagonist.",Perfect Blue

Perfect Blue is one haunting and deeply disturbing piece of anime about the dark side of Japanese Idol worship culture that for the rest of the world may sound bizarre but thank to the power of social media nowadays the story is as relevant as ever when you can literally learn all about one individual with a duble mouth click.

35,jluis1984,A new take to old school horror movies...,9,24 May 2006,"Japanese animation has become a very popular style of animation in Western culture due to the wide range of genres it employs and its many different approaches to storytelling; two elements that immediately set it apart from the common Western style of cartoons that almost always are made for children only. Satoshi Kon's ""Perfect Blue"" quickly became a favorite among western fans of anime because it explored themes rarely seen in western animation; themes that had more in common with the horror genre such as obsessions, murders and suspense.The story revolves around Mima (Junko Iwao), a young singer who is quickly becoming an idol as part of the musical trio ""Cham"". In order to make her career more marketable her managers make her leave the group and join the cast of a famous TV series. However, her new role is considerable different than the cute image she portrayed in ""Cham"", as it requires her to do nude scenes including a rape scene. At the same time she tries to adjust to her new job, someone begins to stalk her and to brutally kill those near her artistic career and Mima begins to wonder if she is really doing the right thing.""Perfect Blue"" is often labeled as a classic of Japanese animation because it presents a way different kind of story to those used to family-oriented animation. In is closer to an Italian Giallo than to a normal cartoon both in thematics and in style. The use of animation as a medium allows director Satoshi Kon to create stylish images of high surrealism as well as powerful images of violence. It is not something young children should watch.Based on a novel by Yoshikazu Takeuchi, the film offers an interesting and harsh criticism to the ""idol culture"" in Japan, and its exaggerated portrait of an obsessed fan is an extreme, yet hauntingly realist image of insane obsessions. The story has been labeled as ""Hitchcocknian"", but its lack of subtlety in terms of graphic violence and nudity, as well as its high level of surrealism puts it closer to the stylish Italian sub-genre of Giallo.By keeping the story around Mima, Satoshi Kon creates haunting atmospheres of paranoia as Mima feels strange in her new career; while it sacrifices character development of the supporting characters, this approach increases the feeling of isolation and adaptation the story has, making a more effective horror/mystery piece. Like any Giallo, the haunting image of the mysterious stalker is always present, and in ""Perfect Blue"" the mystery and suspense are very well handled making the movie a great work of suspense.The animation is very good, and not as flashy as casual anime fans would assume. The movie's mixture of realism and surrealism works very well with the style of drawing and the camera-work is brilliant. Still, while the plot at times gets a bit predictable to hardcore horror fans, it still holds up and keeps captivating from start to end. The original Japanese voice work is very good, so I would recommend watching it with subtitles instead of dubbed.""Perfect Blue"" seems flawless as motion pictures can go, and the odd choice of using animation as medium (it was originally meant to be a normal live action movie) makes it different than the rest. This is a blessing as neither anime fans nor horror fans have seen a quality animated horror movie like this before. 8/10",Perfect Blue
36,FilmOtaku,Very good anime noir,7,7 April 2005,"Based on Yoshikazu Tekeuchi's novel of the same name, ""Perfect Blue"" is a Japanese anime film that tells the story of Mima Kirigoe, a pop idol who decides to leave her musical group while it is still at the top of the charts and concentrate on acting. Unfortunately, this transition does not sit well with one of her fans because an obsessive person who seems to be pervasive in her life soon stalks her. Even when she comes across the fan's website, she finds that the blog entries are not only written to make it seem like they are her thoughts, but they actually ARE her inner-most thoughts. What starts out as a moderately scary obsession quickly becomes a terrifying struggle to both deal with her inner demons and eventually, save her own life.I once heard ""Perfect Blue"" described as ""Hitchcock does anime"", which is a dead-on descriptor for this film. The character designs were slick, the music was good (mostly techno) but the story is fantastic. I honestly was still trying to guess who the stalker was until the end of the film, and the reveal does not disappoint. There are some graphic moments (one is a rape scene on the set of the film she is making) so it does not fall into the stereotypical ""it's a cartoon so it must be okay for kids"" label that the non-anime viewing public seems assume.I highly recommend this film, particularly to people who are not very well versed in anime  it would be a really good way to get your feet wet in the genre. There were many times during the film where I actually forgot I was watching animation, the action and story are so all consuming. Perfect Blue gets a strong 7/10 from me.--Shel",Perfect Blue

39,elicopperman,"Excuse Me, Who Are You?",8,7 October 2018,"When people think of beloved Japanese animated filmmakers besides Miyazaki or Takahata, another notable figure in mind is Satoshi Kon. Even though he only made a few films throughout his sadly short lived life, what he left behind in the industry is nothing short of fascinating. To honor his significance, no other film would be better to look back on then his directorial debut, Perfect Blue. Known for its themes of blurred fantasy and reality, this film famously inspired Darren Aronofsky to make Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan. After 20 years of showing, it still holds up as one hell of a psychological horror.Set in Japan around the 1990s, the film centers around Mima Kirigoe, a once pop singer turned actress who becomes a victim of stalking, which causes her to lose sight between reality and fiction. With this is mind, what makes the film work is how psychological the execution is. As the film is told through different perspectives, Mima becomes challenged by fans, the press and her stalker up to the point where her mind becomes distressed. It isn't until a particular scene in the drama show she stars in where she ends up losing her track of reality. The story keeps on unraveling with more frightening imagery as it goes on, and the intentionally confusing plot adds in to the shear mystery of whether Mima is sane or not.In addition, Kon directs the transitions in a rather hypnotic format to signify what's real and what is out of this world. The usage of lighting and atmosphere really helps set the mood for each individual scene, as every time Mima becomes mixed up between reality and fantasy, the viewers really feel her sense of claustrophobic paranoia. Of course, there is plenty of violence shown throughout given the horror angle, yet the film manages to balance out the thrills in a sophisticated manner without going too over the top. Even if the film could've been done in live-action, I don't think it would've been as strong without the brilliant psychological illusions shown through the eyes of an emotionally distraught fashionista.I think we need more films like Perfect Blue, because its haunting story of a celebrity being toyed with past the point of sanity should be told more often. There are many people out there who may be famous, but their status comes with the price of being taken advantage of by those who desire them past the point of insanity. Plus, the themes of crossing reality and imagination should be taken to other directions too. Even Kon himself made a film called Millennium Actress, where an aging actress tells so many stories about her past career that it's unsure whether she's entirely correct. If a late Japanese film auteur can do it, then it's time someone else did it too.",Perfect Blue
40,MartinTeller,Perfect Blue (1997),7,6 January 2012,"A pop star tries to make the transition to acting, but all these pesky murders keep getting in the way. It's basically anime giallo as Satoshi Kon channels Argento and Bava in this psychological thriller. It gets a bit repetitive at points, but it provides a few surprises and is sufficiently entertaining. The short running time is a big asset, any more of this and it would probably wear out its welcome. I did think most of the animation was rather mechanical and unappealing, though. Also, despite the quasi-feminist viewpoint, there's an awful lot of rape. However, I enjoyed it more than the other two Kon films I've seen.",Perfect Blue
41,MattBrady099,If Kubrick directed Anime it will be something like this,9,4 February 2015,"Mima: ""Excuse me who are you"".The story is about a retired a pop idol, worshipped by the masses until fashion dictated otherwise. In order to salvage her career, she is advised to drop music and pursue acting. A soap opera role is offered but Mima's character is less clean cut than desired. Regardless, she agrees and events take a turn for the worse. She begins to feel reality slip, that her life is not her own. She discovers (imagines) her identical twin, a mirror image that hasn't given up singing. Internet sites appear describing every intimate detail of her life and a figure stalks her from the shadows. Her friends and associates are threatened (and killed) as Mima descends into a dangerous world of paranoid delusion. She fears for her life and must unravel fact from illusion in order to stay alive. Perfect Blue represents a major change from traditional anime subject matter, analysing the pop icon phenomenon, fame and its psychological impact on the performer.It always shocks me how some people can dare to over look things, solid masterpieces out there but people still over look them and go see other films that are just stick in the mood basic films. I just adore the feeling of not knowing anything at the first then be amazed after wards and a film that get's you thinking as well, not like movies today that always play it save by doing the simple three act structure that I normally skip if I had the chance. Perfect Blue can be best described has a movie that you don't just put your feet up, sit back and have a delightful time, no in this you got to use your brain and try your best to piece it together to get the movie. Perfect Blue is Anime that got under my skin and drove the main character and me insane.A quick fun fact here but Black Swan is actually a remake of this movie, yes to those who didn't know that well you do now. If I have to compare what's the better movie I got to say that overall Black Swan is a great movie, but I liked Perfect Blue a lot more so Perfect Blue all the way.The animation in this never looked so well done, so beautiful but also scary and so haunting to look at. At times I thought I was watching a Hayao Miyazaki movie or a Stanley Kubrick film at one point, just be the switch of the atmosphere like it's peacefulness and then a utterly insane feeling to the movie.For problems: Without spoiling anything the ending to me didn't end on a good note in my opinion. It isn't terrible it's just that it left me there going ""Nah"".Overall Perfect Blue is an dark and twisted Anime movie with beautiful but haunting animation that sells the movie off has a deep thinking movie that you shouldn't get lost on track if you really want to understand the film. The film is a slow cult following that I will totally recommend to people who love Anime and analyzing films.",Perfect Blue
42,malkane316,more perfect than blue,8,16 May 2004,"Absolutely beautiful, and mesmerising. This is an extremely complex and complicated movie, especially if you are new to anime. The story tells of Mima, who decides to quit her life as a successful pop star and become an actress, and of the paranoia which follows as people around her die, seemingly because of a psychotic fan. Soon Mima questions whether she is herself, or an impostor, as the outside world seems to know her every move before she does. Think The Usual Suspects had twists? Pfff. This one will have you guessing until the end, and beyond. The dream sequences, if they are dreams, are particularly memorable, and the image of the fan in his room will not easily be forgotten. only the pop music is annoying, but that hardly matters.

The animation is really good as characters and movements appear so life-like, it seems like reality.  There's definitely the theme of 'identity' and Mima's difficulty distinguishing reality from illusion.  Her paranoia and fear tends to grab your attention and as she asks questions, you ask the same ones.  I thought the film also played well with celebrity infatuation and the price of fame.  It really had a lot going for it and the different camera angles give a very dreamy, mysterious atmosphere.  One great shot is the zoom out from Mima's apartment. I could've sworn that was a real city.  ""Who are you?"" sums up this movie.  What a film.  By the way, CHAM's song is really catchy.",Perfect Blue

With threats from her fan, she starts to lose the plot, unable to distinguish between reality and imagination. Though Mima tries to battle on, starting her movie career. Much in the vain of Jodie Foster, Mima has a scene in the movie where she is raped. From this her fan starts killing people involved with the movie; in a real bloody fashion.When you start to watch this, you may feel this is just a simple drama about change, but this is so much more. This is a dark, twist psychological thriller about perfection in the eye of the beholder. Much like whats going on in Mima's mind, you cant tell what is really happening or just imagined.Much like the series Paranioa Agent; also by Satoshi Kon, this deals with change, gossip, the effect of society spreading rumors, escaping perfection and an inverted spin on Stockholm syndrome. With a lot of red herrings throw all over the place, this slowly builds to one great revelation. Its much like the old saying, ""Don't trust anyone"".This is abit of a slow burn to begin with, but it does quickly picks up the pace. The animation is detailed, yet very simplistic. This also has one of the most haunting scores i've heard in a long time. Using a low key violin, with a looping hum and a very tribal chant, it will be in your head days after you've listened to it.If you like this movie, i highly recommend the series Paranioa Agent, as it runs very parallel with this. The only thing wrong with this movie is that its not very long; only about 80mins, but it would have been annoying if it got dragged out to much.This is one of the best thrillers you'll see in a long time, just don't let the animation stop you.",Perfect Blue

The film clearly inspired Darren Aronofsky's ""Black Swan"", and possibly David Lynch's ""Inland Empire"" in the way multiple realities meld through cinema.Unfortunately, despite the fascinating premise and engaging development, the final plot twist and ending failed to meet my expectations.

She is conflicted as to whether or not she should continue to pursue an acting career or revert back to her days as a pop idol.

Satoshi Kon not only amazes with his spectacular direction, but the surreal animation and feel of the movie elevate it far beyond simple anime goodness.

48,Stompgal_87,Easier to follow and better than 'Paprika' yet more intense,8,18 April 2014,"I first saw this film when I rented it out seven years ago but it was the English dub. I watched the majority of it first time around but because the disc was faulty, it froze at the part where Rumi, wearing one of Cham's costumes, is pushed onto a shard of glass, making me think that was the ending due to the disc skipping to the credits but that part was in fact the climax. I found the original Japanese language version with English subtitles on YouTube and decided to watch it again to see if it was as good as I remembered. Despite the English dub of my first viewing differing slightly from the Japanese dialogue with English subtitles, I did indeed find this film as good as I remembered first time around but found certain parts very disturbing.The animation is decent and not as choppy as that in 'Paprika' but there were times where I thought the background characters needed more life and the lip-sync was very basic. The backgrounds are worthy and while the colours are not quite as bright as those in 'Paprika,' the characters are richly cel-shaded. The story is gripping and easier to follow than that of 'Paprika' but it does have several intense elements that are undoubtedly aimed at a more adult audience such as rape, nudity, pornography and bloody images. For me the main plot is the best part that involves Mima leaving her band to focus on her acting career and a ghost of her past stalking her and encouraging her to re-join the band. There are quite a few memorable scenes such as Cham performing their last song with Mima at the beginning of the film, Mima returning home to discover her goldfish are dead, Mima's ghost stalking her and Mima kneeling in the bath. While I preferred the pop songs when they were sung in the English dub, the music during the climax is atmospheric and haunting. I found the ending surprising because it differs from what I originally thought if was but I'm glad it was less intense than what I thought it was if it was abrupt.Overall this was a gripping and intense yet memorable anime directed by the late Satoshi Kon although my number one choices for anime films would be those produced by Studio Ghibli ('Spirited Away,' 'My Neighbour Totoro,' 'Howl's Moving Castle' etc). 8/10 for both the English dub and the original Japanese language version.",Perfect Blue

It had to make a name for itself and stand out among many similar genre movies and shows.And it did it perfectly.Perfect Blue is a stunning thriller that delves into the psyche of idol life. It's a dark and twisting journey that leaves you confused in the best way possible before revealing what you couldn't have thought possible for the storyline. Alongside its beautiful classic anime style, the voice actors bring these characters to life in the truly most spectacular of ways. They feel like real people, developed and alive in the world we sit in; I found myself caring for Mima as though she were a younger sister or a friend. The story left me with an unsettled feeling in my stomach and anxiety gnawing at the corners of my mind as I scanned scene after scene looking for any hidden clues I was missing.This movie left me in shock, reeling and hungry for a lot more than what we got. It did everything perfectly, played the viewer into believing things so spectacularly, I didn't even notice obvious hints that things weren't to be believed. I was thrown from loop after loop in the best way possible and this has a definite rewatch factor of at least seven out of ten.This is a stunning film that's truly intriguing without even trying - horror fans should definitely give it a try and see what they think.

""Perfect Blue"" kept me guessing until its final climactic scenes. There are very few scenes in this movie that don't feature the protagonist Mima and there is no other character that she can truly confide in. The result is that the viewer rarely gets a chance to draw any conclusions about what the hell is going on! Director Satoshi Kon's almost leisurely and cunningly ambiguous approach to the story could be viewed as a turn-off but if you view Mima sympathetically, you'll end up sharing her sense of isolation and paranoia as her grip on reality begins to loosen. This really isn't a film where the viewing experience is enhanced by the use of cannabis!

The most entertaining part for me though was when on rewatches I could consciously decode the symbolism and nuance which created a lot of suffocating atmosphere that most of the movie revels in.
A word of advice for psychological-thriller enthusiasts: This is an obviously confusing movie, but that doesn't mean that it's a puzzle to be solved. The confusion isn't the major hook (unlike say, Memento), it pays deference to the central theme. Everything isn't supposed to be clear - and that's exactly the point.

This dark and deep. During the course of the film the viewer gets confused more and more. This movie conveys lunatic terror of a character who has lost touch with reality, and as the viewer, it's difficult to figure things out.I personally liked the surreal mind-bending approach on the story and the visuals: faces, identities and mirror-reflections start changing rapidly, the main character wakes up from a dream in a dream, her pet fishes dead and then alive again. The 'stalker' has many faces, including her own.I could find similarities for example with Black Swan or Hitchcock films, and I believe there to be many more... copied consciously or unconsciously.The title has nothing to do with the 'actual story', but feeling 'blue' (and the growing depression of the main character) or the innocent sky images in the end of the film might be a connection. The film also uses color-codes very well (cozy reds in the main living room) or washed out cold blues in the outside city. Also, the film lets you forget you are watching an animation sometimes, as the character behave very humanlike (not exaggerated anime-like as in other works) and especially the city exteriors feel like photographs. It's 90s Tokyo all over again.Sometimes, for me, it was hard to stay 'in' the story as it felt TOO real and too ""normal"" (which is a skill of the animation, don't forget!), but after 15 Minutes I was sucked in and wanted to know badly how the story ends!It is a very modern and influental animation.

Kon treats it exactly as if it were live action, mimicking camera effects and tricks, and creating beautiful cinematography that animates contemporary Tokyo like a caress. The film plays with our most intimate ideas of identity - of who we are, of who we want the world to think we are, and of what we're afraid we may become. It also addresses the issue of ageing in the entertainment business. There is self-respect in a label usually applied to banal, repetitive pornography and abuse.

This is the first japanese animated film that I have seen, probably hecause I have always had a strange aversion to Anime as one very popular series really scared me as a child, Saylor Moon, I'm not completely sure what scared me so much that it would make me turn off the TV when the show was on air but I do remember that it gave me nightmares.
This was an awesome experience, I have never seen an animated film like this one, it's extremely interesting with a great and absorbing plot that takes some really cool and fascinating turns, it also has some unexpected really violent scenes which are very affective because of the fact that they are very well animated, the most memourable one probably being the photographer's murder.

Although not as landmark as ""Akira"", ""Ghost In The Shell"" or ""Jin-Roh"", ""Perfect Blue"" still packs a solid mind-numbing punch.  ""Perfect Blue"" is about a young woman who was part of a successful singing group who quits to pursue an acting career.  After making her decision, she becomes the obsession of a really pyschotic admirer.  She also becomes extremely delusional and slowly loses her grip on reality.  ""Perfect Blue"" takes a few shocking twists and ends up with a particularly violent but correct resolution.  The film's main theme is about the price of fame in one's life and the subject is studied really well.  To me, this film is the best film on the subject of paranoia and fame since ""The Bodyguard.""  It is shocking, scary, violent, and disturbing but it is beautifully drawn and directed very well.  I give this film a 10 out of 10!",Perfect Blue

Nonetheless, I went to see this film with an open mind because my friend who took me promised me it was ""anime for people who don't like anime.""Well, at least the Japanese characters looked Japanese.  Contrary to anime convention, there were no red-headed, blue-eyed characters with Japanese names.Other than that, though, the movie was uniformly awful.  All the psycho-thriller cliches were there.  I knew twenty minutes into the movie how it would all turn out.  The dialogue was awkward too, but that may have just been the translation.But worst of all was the animation.  There was little in this film that couldn't have been done (better) in live action.  The only reason to make this film a cartoon was to save money on sets, actors, etc.My friend wants to take me to see ""Princess Mokonone"" next week.  I think I'll tell him I'm sick.",Perfect Blue

She climbs up the rocky road to success by performing as rape victims and posing nude for magazines, but is haunted by her reflections of the past and a serial killer.Roger Corman remarked that if Alfred Hitchcock and Walt Disney had teamed up they would've made a movie something like this. It reminded me a little bit of ""Spirited Away"" but more of the animated sequence in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"", involving Lucy Liu's character's past.It's great fun, the animation is fantastic, the violence and nudity is infrequent but shockingly strong (even though animated). It's a bit silly but nevertheless a wonderful, powerful, must-see movie.If you watch it on DVD, you have the option of watching it in English, or Japanese with English subtitles.I bet Britney Spears will no doubt be cast in the drab American remake!",Perfect Blue
65,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,Intense and Interesting,10,2 July 2019,"Introduction: Perfect Blue is one of my favorite anime films. A film that really understands horror and fear. It takes the stalker premise, and makes a really good film out of it. What can I say Perfect Blue is almost a perfect moive.The Story & Characters: The film centers around a retired pop star, who is stalked by a crazy fan. And the film takes the premise, and turns it into a horrifying thrill ride. As the film is able to really get under the skin. You really sympathize with the main character's struggle, as she is pulled into is tough situation. and the stalker is a really threatening antagonist.The Animation: The style of animation is pretty good. While the quality is not as good as I hoped. But I still enjoy it. Some of the visuals are really nice. And the darker colors set the tone of the film. The animation of the film however, looks like a direct to video film at times. I still like the animation and the film, but it has a few flaws.Conclusion: Perfect Blue is a near perfect film. I enjoy every second of this film. And upon rewatch, I can always find something else to love. It's a great anime that I'd recommend any long time fan, or beginner.",Perfect Blue

67,MrVibrating,Dreadfully cheery Japanese pop idol meets psycho-sexual horror...,8,11 March 2008,"...so why aren't you getting this movie right now? Perfect Blue is what ninety-nine percent of all ""twist"" thrillers the last twenty years have failed to become: A scary, fast-paced and ruthless story that actually makes sense at the end without feeling too contrived. Even after what should have been the death blow for ""twist"" movies in the final scenes of Scary Movie(the original, which actually had a bit of an edge), we see them again and again, but not here.Using animation as a medium works well here. Of course, it saves a lot of money for a country where the movie budgets are ridiculously small, but it also adds a lot of tension. What will happen next? Which conventions of Western cinema can I forget about? What the hell is happening? Those questions will leave you confused and frightened right up till the superb end, which you will NOT see coming.If you found your way to this movie, you are probably as ready as you can get to watch it.

71,tyson-hunsaker,The Perfect Illusion,8,7 September 2018,"This review includes an analysis of the film and will contain spoilers.""Perfect Blue"" stands today as one of Japanese anime's most effective and interesting thrillers to date. Many have been inspired by the film's effective tone and influence on the thriller's potential narrative but few have achieved what ""Perfect Blue"" is capable of. It also stands as Satoshi Kon's most intriguing and technically masterful piece of work. The story follows young Mima, a pop idol turned actress at the peak of her career. As she graciously enters the acting world and accept intimidating and morally questionable roles, she begins to lose her grasp on reality while being tormented by a potentially dangerous stalker. As the story progresses to depict Mima's deepening insanity, so too does the narrative become increasingly more unreliable. Each scene presents itself with new information that gives all previous scenes completely new meaning. Watching this film is indeed a process of learning and trashing what you've just learned, and then getting it back. While the narrative does become complex in its layers, the film never feels like it's out of reach. Thankfully, it never feels needlessly confusing or pretentious (although it comes close to riding that line). Instead, the film presents its material in a thoughtful and meticulous way that makes sense while also puzzling the audience. It's not too difficult to follow but must be watched carefully, as any great film should be. A great strength to the film is its method of building a releasing tension. ""Perfect Blue"" has a unique pattern throughout its run-time of building tension faster than releasing it so while we get moments of breaths and catharsis, we still feel kind of off. We know something isn't right and we're waiting for the ugly and deathly truth to be revealed. What makes this possible is the brilliantly editing and cutting done here. Ever shot's length and sequence is obviously there for a reason and the editing lends itself well to the film's brilliant pace and rhythm. What enriches the experience of ""Perfect Blue"" is also the visual symbols and motifs present throughout the film. Colors play a crucial part in the story's interpretation (I personally feel). Key colors to look for here are white, red, and blue. White seems to wrap the film by beginning and ending the film with white, dreamy illusions that make one wonder, is this a dream? Red signifying oncoming death/violence and blue signifying a sexual undertone as well as loneliness. Red is crucial to the first murder scene of the screenwriter as he looks down in the elevator to see a boombox with a stark red floor just before his eyes are gouged out. Blue's meaning can be found during the lonely night time scenes with the busy but quiet nightscape of Tokyo. What's interesting is the rape scenes, particularly the first one that features noticeable shades of both blue and red. Great filmmaking aside, I do think there are some places where the film doesn't work and those problems reside with key choices in the script. Particularly decisions made during the third act of the piece. As it's revealed that Rumi is the crazy one who's trying to kill Mima, I found myself scratching my head at this unwarranted turn of events. Many great plots and subplots contained great exposition, development, and payoff (three key scenes with Mima's fish) but this one should've been much better handled. Rumi's turn to insanity felt completely forced and out of left field that I just didn't buy it. What could've strengthened the story's third act could've been illusions or false premonitions of the stalker whom Mima killed just a couple scenes ago. Either way, the film's ending provides just enough openness for interpretation while still giving opportunity of some objective answers. Just depends on who you ask.""Perfect Blue"" is genuinely a great psychological thriller that shouldn't be missed. There's a lot to learn from this great film when it comes to pacing, editing, atmosphere, and the power of anti-plot narrative. Each viewing comes with new insights that change the complete interpretation of the film which makes it strangely re-watchable despite its strong adult content. Definitely give this one a few viewings before forming some strong interpretations and thoughts because it deserves it.",Perfect Blue
72,Jeremy Bristol,More like a Brian De Palma film,8,24 February 2002,"A lot of users and critics have said that Perfect Blue is like an Alfred Hitchcock film, but it seems to me that it's more like a Brian De Palma remake of Hitchcock's Frenzy (the only Hitchcock film that I'm aware of that has a graphic rape scene).  That's not to say that it's not a good movie, it's just that Hitchcock films had more subtlety, and you often had to imagine the more graphic elements yourself (just look at the Psycho shower scene or the amputation in Lifeboat).Spoilers: Oddly enough, the first murder is treated like a Hitchcock murder (the attack isn't even shown), whereas the second (and actually imagined) murder is just downright gruesome in its unflinching depiction.  The rape scene, on the otherhand, is probably the most effective I've ever seen, despite (or maybe because of) the fact that it is a: animated, b: a movie, and c: a staged rape for a television show within the movie.  In fact, Mima reacts to the faux-rape as if it were a real rape, phasing out of her self (""dissociation,"" in psychological terms).Unfortunately, the ending of the movie is more De Palma, and it almost made me wish that the imagined sequence (when the Double Bind actors said that Mima created a new life as an actress for herself after being raped in a strip club) was the real story.  It would have been more interesting, realistic, and fitting for the movie.",Perfect Blue
73,olliecurtis,A mixed bag,5,19 May 2021,"I watched Perfect Blue because of it's extreme influence on Black Swan (2010), one of my all time favourite films. While I found this to be more ambitious, I cannot say it lived up to Aronofksy's film. The plot was too far-fetched for me to actively seek out to understand what was happening in Mima's head. I think that Me-Mania was a brilliant villain, and Rumi becoming the main antagonist by the end felt like a disservice to the terrifying force that had been ominously stalking Mima throughout the entire film. I think the violence in this film is unnerving and I like the borderline excessive gore, especially in an animated film.Overall I found this to be a poorer substitute to Black Swan and I'm gonna go watch it now to re establish why it is so great.",Perfect Blue
74,Raptorclaw155,"No Spectacle, More Visually Impressive",8,11 July 2020,"In a world where modern hand-drawn animation relies more heavily on visual spectacle to impress audiences, Perfect Blue is a refreshing contrast to that.That isn't to say that this is a bad looking film, in fact its strongest asset is the way it tells its story visually, but Perfect Blue's visual language seems more akin to that of a conventional film than an animated one. As a result, you start to forget that it's an animated film. I might say that Perfect Blue is the most live-action adaptation-friendly Japanese animated film, but that comes with an asterisk, that being, it needs to have its visual language preserved. The way this film is shot and edited feels like a work of art cinema and as a result, it keeps you guessing about what's actually happening.Perfect Blue is an exceptional piece of Japanese cinema, animated or not. It's a film that, while animated and therefore branded as anime, does not fall for the same tropes and stereotypes that so many other films that have since been released fall for. It's no wonder that this film is recommend to people as a first experience for those who are new to anime because this is the least-anime anime film I think I've ever seen. I can't recommend this film enough. In an age where explicit explanation of things that are happening are a standard in popular, modern films, it's nice to see one that focuses on sharing its story in the way film was originally intended to.",Perfect Blue

82,m0rg16,"An anime that cries for ""live action""!",3,28 August 2005,"A friend of mine told me to check this film out. I was reluctant at first, since I find most thrillers to follow along the same lines, but my friend told me that this film was really different.My friend was wrong. This film isn't different at all. This is basically your standard Ashley Judd thriller, except that it's anime. If you're familiar with anime, this film won't even make you budge. There's a scene where there's a dead body in an elevator. They way it was shown wasn't really shocking at all, even though that was obviously it's intent. Had it been filmed in live action, however, it would have made a very nice shot, which would probably have lingered with you for a long time afterwards. But in other scenes, the director goes all out anime and just lets there be blood spurting in every director. No matter what, it's not original, and we're all yawning twenty minutes into the film.The plot follows Mima, a singer in a pop band called CHAM!. In the beginning of the film, Mima announces that she is going to retire from the pop scene and try to strike out as an actor instead. So she enters a TV-series called Double Bind, which is basically a thriller series. But not all of Mimas fans are happy with her decision to become an actress, and some feel that she is a traitor for giving up on the band. One fan takes the step to far as he begins to send her threats, and even harms some people around Mima. It is all to much for Mima, who eventually starts seeing illusions of herself, prancing around in her old CHAM!-dress. What follows is a series of events where we aren't sure what's real, who's killing who and why this is happening. In the end, only one thing is explained for sure, whereas all the rest is left open for interpretation.But, by the end, you won't care anymore. You'll be snoring already. In fact, the second the end credits rolled, I hit the stop button, obviously disappointed and went to tell the world what a dull movie this is. Sure, the plot may not be exactly that of other thrillers, but it's close enough. Add to that, it brings absolutely nothing new with it. It's just an ordinary thriller, except for the fact that it's animated! Dull! And you don't really care for any of the characters either, because there's no background, or character even, given to any of the people in this film.If you would compare this film to, say, Silence of the Lambs, this film pales in comparison. That film has you on the edge of your seats, and there's many chilling scenes. There's also the awesome performance of Anthony Hopkins, and a good story. This film has no good performances, since it's an animated film, it doesn't have a very good plot, and it's not chilling or atmospheric.So what does this film really have going for it? I can't actually think of anything. It's just dull.",Perfect Blue
83,vkn,"Succeeds all the way at being horribly scary, in a very good way.",8,2 November 2001,"Perfect Blue is a storming success in every department. As a movie in itself, it's a brilliant piece of work, packed with style and -very- powerful scares. We follow teen pop idol Mima, who tries to make the switch from singing to TV acting. Everything seems normal enough at first, with just the somewhat funky directing hinting at things to come. But it wouldn't be a thriller if good ol' normality didn't come crashing to pieces to make way for some terrifying madness and violence. Things start to go pear-shaped when the studio staff working around Mima are threatened, and later horribly killed, apparently by an obsessed Mima-fan who doesn't like the new direction her career is taking. And as if that wasn't bad enough, Mima herself is starting to go bonkers with all the pressure. She begins to have visions of a disturbing alter ego, more or less her ""old self"" from her singing days. And this ""other"" Mima doesn't want to play second fiddle to the new acting image Mima has taken on; she claims to be the real one, with the flesh-and-blood Mima being the fake. Mima's delirium grows gradually more entangled, until she sinks into a mental state where it's impossible for her, and for the audience to tell what is, and what is not really happening. And there are still those murders going on...Granted, the ""movie within a movie"" gimmick has been done before so often that it doesn't even strike me anymore as original. Reality-twisting is also something I've seen before. All the same, Perfect Blue managed to impress me enormously, and scare my socks off like no other film. There's something about not knowing for sure (as a viewer) what is and isn't for real that always keeps one intrigued. Particularly during the more violent moments (and the film does get seriously nasty), one is constantly praying that it's -not- for real. ""Go on, snap out of it, Mima. This is too scary to be real, you're just having another vision...right? Right?"" The leitmotiv of a second self also intrigues me, and I found it delightful trying to pick out which Mima was really the ""real"" one. Just how strong is ""false"" Mima's presence in reality? Is she a complete phantom of the imagination, or does she have a litteral, physical presence of some kind? And most of all; out of these two versions of herself, which one does Mima really want to be? If you can't tell for sure what does and doesn't really happen, you also might not take everything the characters declare for granted. The ending does provide a somewhat logical explanation that ties up all of the insanity again, but that doesn't mean the fun of figuring this out for yourself is completely spoiled; you can very well not take the ending entirely for granted either (while it makes sense, there are some bits about the explanation it provides that don't completely gel with me). Lots of re-watchings and picking apart of hints is in store for me there. Love it when that happens ^^.A few tiny niggles; the animation quality in the first half of the film is not quite breathtaking, and seemed decidedly below-par for movie quality animation. Luckily, it picks up later on, becoming pleasingly smooth. And by the time you reach the terror of the later part of the film, you're already too frightened to really be picky about animation quality. Some of the violent and/or explicit scenes are very nasty indeed (ewww, straight people, sick man), but they serve the purpose of enhancing the fright factor very well, rather than just being needless grotesqueries to please the gore-junkies in the style of that hideous Akira. The film is a complete success as a frightening, surreal and involving thriller (though I do still like Jinn-Roh much better).But another reason to rejoice is that Perfect Blue is a step in the right direction for the general public's image of what anime really is. Sure, the enlightened few among us for whom Evangelion is standard fare, and who can give detailed insights into the latest CLAMP titles already know that anime is not ""a genre"". It's a medium in itself, and the Japanese animation market can, and does treat every imaginable genre and subject, often with skill that leaves feeble Hollywoodian efforts miles behind itself (in the case of Perfect Blue, it speaks volumes that a celluloid character such as Mima manages to become more lifelike and sympathetic than any sillicone tarts Hollywood chucks around the screen). It's hardly uncommon to see a genre such as a psychological stalker-thriller treated in animation to the Japanese. Heck, they've done every other imaginable thing under the sun in animation, and a damn good job they do at it as well. It's just a shame that hardly any of the really good stuff ever makes it over to the West, thus creating a distorted image for casual western viewers. We do seem to have made some progress from the Akira Aftertaste years, where anime was generally put on the same line as sex and violence and very little else (side-step; how come nobody ever raises a finger when live Yank actors engage in orgies of the most brutal porn and bloodshed in just about every Hollywood flick ever made, but the whole world screams bloody murder when an anime character so much as takes his socks off? Live Yanks can get away with everything?). Now it's ""anime is just pink-haired fairies in giant explosive turbo robots"". They're getting just a tiny bit warmer, but maybe Perfect Blue will get the message across to a few others that anime embraces a diversity that ranges from Sailor Moon to Wings of Honneamise (and I'm just globally sketching here), with a reasonably large number of people getting to actually see this. A quite decent English dub that doesn't hamper the film too much is also a plus, though a dub will of course never equal the original. It might help to keep the above paragraph in mind for a Perfect Blue viewer not initiated to the big picture of anime. In any case, it's an impressive movie for anyone, worth seeing for being so unique, gripping and masterfully scary. I'll think twice before I look into a mirror for a long time to come after this...A final note about the notorious comment that this could be a Disney-Hitchcock hybrid. Hitch perhaps, but comparing this kind of quality to Disney's paper-flat commercial slop is simply an insult to Perfect Blue.",Perfect Blue
84,Dante Hicks,Excellent and clever thriller,8,20 January 2000,"After borrowing a friends copy of this film and mulling over whether or not to watch it for a couple of weeks I finally decided to bite the bullet and, I thought, waste 90 minutes of my life. After being bored senseless and, at times, disgusted by the usual tosh spewed forth from Japanese animation studios I honestly expected the same from this, despite a spirited defence of it from said friend. What I found was a quite excellent thriller quite unlike anything I had ever seen in the genre. It started off quite ordinarily, filling us in with the story of how Mima left CHAM to pursue an acting career but after about 40 minutes, when her life has been turned upside down and her sanity called into question, the film itself moved into top gear and used every trick possible to keep us in suspense. I found myself gripped as Mima struggled to make sense of her surroundings, what's real and what's not. I don't want to give anything away but the ending is a real shock, for two reasons. You don't know whether there is a killer or if there is who it could be. It's a great ending. The film within a film is also brilliantly woven into Mima's confused life and the parallels between herself and her character are exploited perfectly until you're not sure if it's Mima herself who is the character and vice versa. All in all it's an excellent thriller/whodunnit and the comparison to Hitchcock is more than justified. This film has single-handedly re-acquired an interest within me for Anime in general. However, I think I'll still stay clear of the violent/sex-orientated end of the market. I just hope there is more where this came from.",Perfect Blue

Me-Mania, who has a mask like face reminiscent of Reggie Nalder from Argento's 'Bird With The Crystal Plumage,' is revealed to have been impersonating her on a web site / blog he created, called 'Mima's Room.' When Mima's friend and manager hooks her up to the Internet, she discovers the fanatical 'Mima's Room' site, and learns that someone knows her every waking move, leaving her paranoid and unsure of how to proceed. Things go from bad to worse when Mima's associates start dying in brutal ways. The plot of 'Double Blind' (the TV soap she gets a small role in), begins to parallel Mima's troubles and her tenuous grip on reality, as the soap has her playing a girl who believes she is a pop idol. 'Perfect Blue' like 'Double Blind' has a narrative that cuts between reality and nightmares, as Mima becomes haunted by a figmentary alter-ego who starts to elbow into her identity. The delusional states of fan and idol are shown to be complementary as well as interdependent. A notorious acted out rape scene for the TV show 'Double Bind,' results in the narrative becoming particularly fragmented just like Mima. She is disorientated and on the edge of madness.As an aside, Darren Aronofsky purchased the American rights to 'Perfect Blue' for $59,000, so he could film the brief ""bath scene"" with Jennifer Connelly in his own film 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000). The staged rape scene in 'Perfect Blue' also inspired a scene toward the end of Aronofsky's film in which a group of men circle around and cheer on two women using a double ended dildo.",Perfect Blue
88,Boris-57,"Exquisite viewing pleasure, but not perfect",9,18 November 2004,"First of all, let me comment on those saying that they have enough of hyper realistic anime, because then why didn't they just make a regular film? Well that's just bogus from people still stuck in ""movies is real people"" time. I for one sometimes think whilst seeing a regular movie ""why not making an anime out of this?"" Furthermore, there IS a reason why an anime might work better, simply because the characters are more abstract and easier to identify with.This said, the script & realistic drawing, though groundbreaking for anime perhaps, is a fairly common thriller script, including the serial killer. But it's the characters (the 'acting'?) that lift it above the ordinary. I absolutely fancy Mima (in a cartoonish way I might add in order not to be considered a nerd with a disturbed affection allocation), and the film really made me care for her. The nudity helps, of course, but it's more. While you think her just a stupid little singer wanting to be an actress, she really grows during all the mess.The twist didn't really surprise me or 'do' it for me, as I've become numb to twists, but it doesn't matter. Though the story's mainstream, the movie-making is top-shelf. The angles, development and jumpy cuts keep you glued. The 7.4 it gets at the moment might only be a slight underestimation, it still is imperative watching. Ai no tenshi!",Perfect Blue

Mima is a pop idol with a clean image who decides to become an actress with a not so clean image. She is being stalked by an obsessed fan and also is seeing her past form. What is real? What isn't? Is Mima sane? Is she psychologically screwed? What the hell is going on? These are just few of the questions that'll pass through your mind while watching the movie. Everything is executed beautifully. There are also quite a few disturbing scenes in the film which just add to the beauty of the film. When you're done watching the movie, you'll be questioning reality and illusion yourself.The only things I found negative were the somewhat overuse of nudity and the ending being a bit confusing.

91,mcrpghk,"Nothing is perfect, maybe it's not even blue!",10,12 April 2021,"Perfect Blue is the best picture of how the life of a famous person works behind all the glamour of the cameras.Unsurprisingly, the world of fame is full of dirt, and in Satoshi Kon's film we have a bigger perspective of these problems in the life of a Japanese Idol, besides being treated as a small gear that moves the industry, these girls rarely have freedom in their personal life, being manipulated with promises to leverage their career or with conversations like : ""your fans will love it"". So these end up going into several projects that are uncomfortable for your life.It is visible that today, a little more than 20 years after the release of the film these problems remain current, which demonstrates that the machine has not stopped working, was only better made up, which is very sad if we think that the advance of the internet and social networks could expose everything that dirty in this beautiful world of celebrities , but the truth is that strengthened the cult of artists and popstars, as much as every month we are bombarded with sad news about the lives of those who submit or end up trapped in the life of idol, it is the very fans of these people who hinder the public to give greater attention to these complaints, thus encouraging the continuation of this practice. As much as they do not directly defend the daily abuse that these young people suffer, they end up muffling it using as an example ""that group is well treated"" or ""in that company it does not happen"" when they know that the reality is that these are minority and that still uncertain, moreover these same fans who defend them are the same to attack if their favorite idols go out of the standard expected by their followers.The film also makes it clear that most of those who accompany the Idols are more interested in their body and in satisfying their fantasies than in fact the artwork of those who take the stage, so much so that it is normal after going through the first phase of their career, that is, the fun and cute girl, leave for adult shows and sexy rehearsals , as with the protagonist ""Mima"".The pressure that these artists have is shown perfectly, bordering from the paranoia of stalkers to the state of madness, for doing things they did not want just to ensure continuous success and not be forgotten since the vast majority of celebrities end up getting more and more vague and replaceable, especially when it comes to appearance.In addition duality is the key point to embark on everything that this film provides us, the director was a great master by confusing us with the delusions of ""Mima"", putting us inside them, where even we ask what is real or dream, the great truth is that all we saw will only have its explanation for those who pick up the smallest details of the film , from a broken mirror to the view of a window!",Perfect Blue

94,ralo229,A Truly Suspenseful Anime With a Hitchcock Flair to it,10,25 March 2014,"If Alfred Hitchcock and Hayao Miyazaki worked on a project together, this is probably what they would make. Perfect Blue revolves around a young woman named Mima, who leaves her career as a pop singer and starts a career as an actress. While doing this, she is stalked by an obsessed fan and tormented by, what seems to be a ghost of her past self as a pop singer. This sends Mima into a deep psychological torture that may drive her off the deep end.So what are the pros of this movie? Well, the story is probably one of the best I've seen in any animated film, the editing was superb, and the music was always perfect for the present situation. The story itself can get really confusing at times, which is probably what the film is going for, but is explained in a clever manner later on. In fact, the way Mima compares the movie she's shooting to her current situation is a pretty clever idea and it sure as hell confuses the audience about what's real and what's not. Great storytelling right there.So what are the cons of this movie? While I don't hate this movie at all, I'm not gonna act like I don't have my problems with it. Luckily, there's only very few. The animation was bit choppy at times and I can imagine that it probably didn't look very good on the big screen. I do think Mima was a bit of a bimbo at times and the ending was terrible. ""Now I'm the real me,"" she says. Really? That's what this movie is ending off of? But all of these are blown out of the water by the pros.I give Perfect Blue an 8/10 because it truly is a very suspenseful film that keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through. Whether you're a fan of anime or not, I assure you that you will enjoy this film.",Perfect Blue
95,Aeris4ever,Best animated thriller I've seen,10,31 March 2002,"Anyone who can get past the fact that ""Perfect Blue"" is animated should see it.  Well, anyone who is over 17, I should say.  Don't let the anime look fool you, this is a great psychological thriller meant for adults.  It's intelligent, confusing, thought-provoking, violent and mesmerizing.  The animation is good and gets better as the movie progresses.  The English dub is actually very good, especially the woman who voiced Mima Kirigoe, the main character; that had to be a tough job.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:  The movie begins with a series of flashbacks that show Mima's departure from Cham, a moderately successful pop trio.  She has decided to pursue an acting career instead.  Soon after getting her first acting gig by participating in dirty and disturbing scenes in a drama series, Mima discovers a website which is run by someone claiming to be her, in an effort to keep her pristine pop idol image alive for her fans.  Cham is becoming more successful as a duo and Mima is visited by an illusion of her old self who ridicules her choice of becoming a slutty actress.  As the drama series goes on, it begins to parallel Mima's real-life delusions. People close to her are being murdered and her grasp on reality begins to slip.  Unable to distinguish between reality and make-believe, Mima slowly deteriorates until she comes face to face with the one who wants to do her in. There are two English versions of this movie: an edited rated-R version and an unedited director's cut which is not rated.  If it were, it would be very close to being NC-17.  I found both versions floating around in the same library system, so if you plan to see the movie, make you know what you're getting.  I'd recommend the director's cut, only because you'll miss some important imagery and emotion in the edited version.  There's a lengthy rape scene, albeit staged, that is disturbing after awhile, but it's not as gratuitous as it seems; it does serve a purpose in showing Mima's grasp on reality beginning to fade.  I could do without the rape scene, but another important montage was cut from the edited version, due to nudity.  Either version is great for adults over 17.  I can't imagine anyone younger seeing the director's cut, it's pretty nasty and not something a kid can appreciate for it's symbolism.  I would also recommend this movie to any of the pop divas that grace our T.V.'s and clog the airwaves everyday, especially the ones who want to act-we know who they are.  It might freak them out senseless!",Perfect Blue
96,ThomasP909,Wow wow wow!,10,5 March 2021,This movie gives me the chills everytime I watch it. The fact that this movie was made in the 90s blows my mind. It was way ahead of its time. This film is actually relevant today in society. This was a dark and psychological film the shook me to the core. Probably the best anime film I've watched.,Perfect Blue
97,Abyss47,A landmark of Japanese animation and an unforgettable experience.,9,2 June 2013,"A visceral and mind-bending experience, ""Perfect Blue"" reminded me why I love anime in the first place. It constantly toys with the thin line between fantasy and reality in exciting and clever ways that later surrealist films such as ""Black Swan"" and ""Inland Empire"" would also attempt to emulate. Of course, nothing beats the original.The protagonist, a singer-turned actress named Mima continually experiences illusions that essentially drive her crazy. Some of these illusions involve death, showcasing her killing people close to her, such as her co-stars and others involved in the film she's making. Mima also seems at first to be stalked by a deformed looking man, who is seen from the very beginning of the film when Mima and her singing group have their last concert performance. After that, he's seen everywhere. Mima can't get him out of her mind even when he's clearly not physically next to her.Other illusions show her being harassed by what at first seems like her alter-ego, a ghostly figure who keeps taunting Mima and basically breaking down her spirit. This figure looks the same as Mima, except without the emotional baggage that Mima herself carries, and she shows up constantly throughout the film in Mima's head. One brilliant scene that really had my brain spinning for a second is when the male stalker is seen typing on a computer, I'm guessing a letter for Mima, and right alongside him is the ghostly Mima figure talking in his ear. The stalker had this voice in his head telling him that Mima wants him, basically, and that's what that scene seems to hint at. This goes hand-in-hand with real life incidents of celebrity stalking, specifically of actresses. A lot of actresses put themselves out there for everyone to see, and as they're objectified by the industry, most guys who otherwise wouldn't give a damn fawn all over them. The media has a powerful effect on the human mind.Now, the scene that really gets me is when Mima supposedly kills the stalker, because throughout the middle portion of the film, she's shown having all these various dreams and illusions, all of which are at first presented as being real. Every time I thought one was real, I was brought back to reality by Mima waking up or something similar. Mima killing the stalker seemed to be just another vision, and the reason she was having all those visions of a deformed male stalking her is because she's always harbored negative feelings about males and is in reality insecure around most of them. This is further exemplified by the scene in which Mima is filming a rape scene for her movie that looks vividly real, and she begins panicking for real (or just acting really, REALLY well), and gets drowsy in the process to the point of nearly fainting. Her illusions and paranoia make her a more believable actress in the long run, to the point where the director and others around her start to get creeped out, or simply suspicious. Males are presented as killers in the media extremely often, and that combined with Mima's insecurities about males (something bad may have happened to her as a child, having to do with a male) is the primary why Mima imagines a creepy looking male going around doing all these various killings. She couldn't be more wrong when it's revealed at the end of the film that her stalker is in fact an obese female, which leads to one hell of an intense finale.The way the entire film played with my head and had me constantly thinking of possible answers is something I haven't experienced viewing an anime since I sat down and watched ""Paranoia Agent"", coincidentally by the same director.The way the story is told is superb, and I'm normally not even the biggest fan of surrealism, but there's something about the way it's used in this film that made me love it.There are also some truly unforgettable images scattered throughout the film, such as the amusing opening shot which spoofs the Power Rangers, the shot of a dead man in an elevator with his eyes gouged out and blood all over him, a grotesque shot of a man getting stabbed literally in the balls with a screwdriver, and several others. It's just one hell of a film. The animation is very much apart of its time, yet has a timeless appeal and a distinct charm that a lot of the animation of today severely lacks. Helps that it was handrawn.""Perfect Blue"" is one of the defining classics of Japanese animation, and if you enjoyed it on even a basic level, I definitely recommend checking out some of the director's other work, as it's also great.",Perfect Blue

101,AloysiusWeasley,MUCH better anime to be seen!,3,10 December 2007,"*****Very VERY minor spoilers****** Okay, I just checked this out when it aired (dubbed) on the sci-fi channel. I will tell you ahead of time, I watch any anime I can get my hands on, so no worries this review is going to be like some of the other clowns commenting on this with things like ""I had no idea what an 'anime' was before this, har har!"". *eyeroll* Anyway, I will say first that this is a little different than most anime I've seen thus far. After watching, this really struck me as a cross between Law and Order: SVU and anime, only in this movie, you follow around a pop singer/beginning actress instead of the cops. No supernatural stuff to be found in here, so no awesome robots or post-apocalyptic societies.Now, I usually love anime, and seeing me giving one a low rating is quite unusual, so why four stars? Let me count the ways: - I was paying pretty strict attention, and it makes VERY little sense! When you hit about the middle of the movie, the Mima (the main character the film follows around) is having serious delusions, first seeing herself in many places in her old pop-singing outfit, and later, apparently dreaming of her work as an actress. It quite literally hits a big piece of the movie where it's practically IMPOSSIBLE to tell what's real and what's not. I only wish I was joking.This anime is dated. They have a bit where Rumi (The girls' manager? Something along those lines) is explaining how to use the internet. Not only is Mima's spoiled whining harsh on the ears, the explanation is painfully simple and grating to anyone who's ever been even in close proximity to a computer.I've seen a couple commenters say the dubbing is pretty good. I say - not REAL good! Most especially in the beginning, where Mima is singing with the two other members of her pop group CHAM, the dubbing was about half again as good as in the original Godzilla. Needless to say, the voices and the the mouths moving don't always match up.If you're not fond of characters doing stupid things to further the plot, you may have a real problem with this movie. One point in particular that left me incredulous: Mima receives a letter bomb, and her manager's hands are cut up pretty good. Yet...no one calls the police? - I'm not usually one that even tries to figure how how things are going to turn out in mysteries and thrillers of any kind, but the ending is pretty predictable. Needless to say, your first impressions of the characters are probably spot-on. However, in one of the very last frames, the movie tries to throw in one last twist (?), but I fail to see what that was trying to accomplish or imply.Now for the things that earned it four stars: - If you're into techno or j-pop (I am, of course), you'll probably find the music in this pretty nifty.The animation is pretty good. It looks more realistic than in many other anime I've seen, though it's not my personal favorite style.As you'll recall in the beginning of my review, I mentioned that I'd just caught this on sci-fi. Now, having not seen the original version of this in either the r-rated or unrated version on DVD, I realize that (as usual) the network may have cut some pretty good chunks out of it. However, the editing must not have been too severe, as taking a look at the message board here proves that even if you've seen it on DVD, it STILL doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Either way, I'm giving it a little benefit of the doubt, as I vividly recall the horrible and totally unnecessary edits commonly made to anime. Never mind the fact that one often sees things like this on Law and Order or CSI, but there you go.Finally? I'm personally offended that some people have dared to compare this to an absolutely fabulous anime that came out the same year, Studio Ghibli's ""Princess Mononoke"". Not only are the two of COMPLETELY different genres, comparing Princess Mononoke to Perfect Blue is like eating a piece of chocolate VS. being stabbed in the eye. No, really.Bottom line - don't waste your time. If it's a crime/psychological thriller you're looking for, there are vastly better movies. If you're looking for good anime - RUN AWAY. Hands down, this is probably the worst anime I've ever seen, and definitely the one that made the least sense.",Perfect Blue

Mima's fans from her pop career aren't happy about this change either, and tensions turn violently quickly. But who is committing these vicious acts?Satoshi Kon makes us question what we perceive publicly may not be what happens privately. He uses this dichotomy to criticise how people are run into the ground by the entertainment industry, privately these people are trading their dignity for fame, but to those on the outside, such as Mima's stalker, it all seems glamorous or even self- indulgent. Kon, however, doesn't just ridicule people who run the industry, but asks what type of person wants to enter this industry, and what does it take to succeed in it? And he believes it can only be the mentally unstable.This belief frames the film; Kon chooses to give the film a psychotic tone and feel, as an audience we are disconnected from it all. Kon uses editing to blur the boundaries of reality; in the scene where Mima first reads her stalkers blog, Kon jumps back and forth between the two slowly warping her stalker into Mima herself.The script also obscures the reality of the characters, if you look at that blog it does not just detail Mima's movements but her exact thoughts and feelings. These two characters seem to share a psychosis, and the constant repetition by Mima of saying ""Who am I?"" makes it obvious how Mima feels about herself. Yet I was left unsatisfied.The animation is the first thing I had a problem with, Kon draws the characters in a clichéd Anime manner. Mima for example is big breasted, and has large facial features. Kon also uses bold colours to distinguish the characters from the background; this felt like a budget constraint rather than a style choice. The backgrounds are lethargic as well, and this becomes apparent when the action is fast paced, especially in the climactic scene of the film where it becomes hard to understand how things are happening. This is highlighted even more by some of the interesting scenes, especially the scene in the bath.I wasn't worried about the characters either, now I know this is intentional, but when you consider that the film is trying to unravel a mystery it is hard to care about that when those effected by it are unlikable. Mima is annoying airhead, her manager is weak and self-absorbed, her agent is sleazy, and her stalker is just weird. Adding more scenes like the one in the bath would have made me feel more engaged, the run time is only 85 minutes so this wouldn't have slow things down and added depth.Kon took a huge risk in picking such a complex topic for his debut film but it feels like an incomplete artistic vision.",Perfect Blue

One scene in particular that had that effect on me was the rather nasty scene where a pizza-delivery boy stabs the photographer to death in his apartment with an icepick (a friendly warning to viewers-please beware!! this scene is EXTREMELY graphic!! If you are of a nervous disposition, or of a weak bladder, then avoid at ALL costs!!) On a slightly more positive note, ""Perfect Blue"" gives an excellent insight into the way in which many artists/performers are used and abused in the entertainment industry. I kind of feel sorry for people like the film's lead character, Mima (short for Mimarin) in a way.what is interesting about this film is how the viewer's sense of distinguishing between fantasy and reality is blurred along with that of Mima. You are left not being able to determine what is real or fantasy, and end up feeling very disorientated! The animation on show in ""Perfect Blue"" is very sharp and crisply-drawn.

Perfect Blue is a good and thrilling watch, owing much to its sexual buildup. The fragility of the main character in the hands of her environment is effective. The themes of the film are reflected in its symbolism. For that, it does better than most.
However, unlike e.g. Lynch films, the film rounds out a bit too well and, at least for me, doesn't really leave the viewer disturbed or confused. What I both love and hate so much about Lynch films is that they succeed so well in emulating the feeling you have after just waking up from a dream, trying to puzzle together the strange images that are left in your memory. Perfect Blue, by contrast, simple gave me the epiphany of a decent plot twist.

One of her managers feels it's the best idea for her, but the other, Rumi, a former pop idol herself, thinks it is career suicide. Despite all, Mima lands herself a small yet harrowing part on a TV drama. At the same time, a website starts up called ""Mima's room"", purporting to be written by Mima herself.

She begins to confuse dreams with reality, and the past with the present. Is her personality really splitting, and is she somehow involved in the murders? I've said too much already! The first few minutes of Perfect Blue feel pretty much like anything you would expect a teenybopper anime to be. Lots of pop music, screaming teenage girls, and tough looking boys. But this all melts away pretty quickly after the title sequence, luring you in with an easy charm. There are very few punches pulled here. The murder sequences are short, but pretty damned brutal. The killer likes to stab the victims in the face with a screwdriver, and occasionally in the groinal area too. The rape scenes and other exploitative nudity scenes are just what you would expect from the nation of folks who eat rapes for breakfast; they are kinda uncomfortable.What works so well is how the film is realized. I'm not sure if it would be as great as a live action film, but apparently there is one already made in Japan. The fluid camera positions coupled with the colour tones are flawless. For me, the film feels like a messed up blend of Argento's Tenebrae crossed with Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. Ya think I'm talking outta my hairy flossy? Just check out the scene Aronofsky borrowed for Requiem. You will know it when ya see it. He even owns the rights to this film, apparently.Perfect Blue is stylish, dark and disturbing, but flows brilliantly and without any hiccups. This is one little flick you will want to watch more than once. Check it out, but don't watch the dubbed version!",Perfect Blue

This movie make me had nightmare just thinking about it make fell uncomfortable but, this movie is superb the plot is so good.This is not a family's movie(it surely not!)there is a some mystery about the main character she is just in my opinion give me some uneasy feeling.I highly recommended this movie but,careful you will not gonna like it and be sure to be amazed you had been warned!

110,Richie-33,A groundbreaking anime,10,18 December 1999,"This film is a stunning example to Western audiences of how anime films do not have to be about giant robots and laser guns. Granted, the crazed stalker theme is nothing new, but this takes a back seat to the main character's confusion and paranoia due to the mind games she is subjected to. In fact, there is no effort made to disguise the identity of the stalker, the emphasis is placed firmly on the psychological repercussions of the pressure the young Mima is subjected to, not just by her crazed fan, but on the lengths she must got to in order to maintain her popularity. The film neatly weaves real events around the similar plot of the series that Mima stars in to try and boost her flagging career. This serves to increase the uncertainty of what is real and what isn't, leaving you at the end of the film wanting to watch it again to discern which scenes are fact and which figment. The haze of confusion is punctuated on occasion with startling scenes of violence, highlighting the extreme nature of her fan's feeling he is responsible for her protection. If there were to be any faults with Perfect Blue then the voice acting (in the dubbed version), although better than most anime, is a slight detraction from the film's quality. Also, the stereotyped appearance of the stalker is a disappointment, although the animators sometimes convey a true sense of his adoration and love for Mima which serves to make the viewer more sorry for his delusion than fearful of him. And couldn't the translators have looked in the thesaurus instead of describing Mima as a 'pop idol' every single time? All in all, a thoroughly recommended film, not just for anime fans but for anyone who is interested in an intelligent, mature psychological thriller and can look past the fact it is 'just a cartoon'. You won't find anything like this on Children's BBC.",Perfect Blue

115,Locut0s,Interesting but not Satoshi Kon's best work.,5,3 May 2010,"The film revolves around a Japanese pop idol who leaves a girl group to start a career in acting. However she is uncertain about her move and is followed by ghosts both real and imagined from her previous life. Like in Paprika Satoshi Kon plays with the meaning of reality and what it means to be sane. The sense of paranoia and uncertainty of ones own senses when experiencing an emotional trauma is well conveyed here. However ultimately the film feels too flat for my tastes. Paprika is a lively colourful and imaginative romp into the world of insanity. This on the other hand is much more controlled and realistic, and while that would usually be something that recommends a film here it ends up falling flat. I kept hopping the film would sprout wings and explore the realm of paranoia and insanity the way only anime can really do so but it never really truly delivers.",Perfect Blue
116,dmace-55748,Satoshi Kon's Japanese Animated Psychological Thriller,10,20 July 2019,"Perfect Blue is Satoshi Kon's 1st movie as a director. It combines the works of Alfred Hitchcock & David Lynch into 1 big suspenseful anime. According to Roger Corman, he said that if Alfred Hitchcock partnered with Walt Disney, they would make a picture like this.Perfect Blue tells the story of a retired pop singer named ""Mima Kirigoe"" who wanted to become an actress. During her transition, she begins to lose her sense of reality as the people she works with starts to turn up dead. Things start to kick in shortly after the ""fake"" rape sequence at a strip club while the direct-to-video series called ""Double Bind"" is currently filming. A stalker named ""Mr. Me-Mania"" becomes obsessed with her, her alter ego starts to chase her, & a website called ""Mima's Room"". After the terrifying climax sequence, everything goes back to normal. But immediately before the credits start, Mima says those words...
""No. I'm the real thing"".Perfect Blue is 1 of the scariest & most confusing animated movies I've ever seen in my life. I was 14 when I 1st saw that film, & a lot of people as they are watching the film are like ""What the f*ck was going on?"". I understood what happened. It was a terrifying masterpiece.Perfect Blue currently has 7.9/10 stars on IMDB & no score on Metacritic. The current percentage on Rotten Tomatoes is 77% percent with an average of 7.01/10. MyAnimeList currently has 8.4/10 stars. If I were in control of the Metacritic system, I would give the film an 83/100.Perfect Blue is also based on the novel by ""Yoshikazu Takeuchi"". The score is done by ""Masahiro Ikumi"". The soundtrack can be very creepy & catchy. It will send shivers down your spine.Darren Aronofsky loved the movie so much, he used the same scene in Requiem for a Dream with Jennifer Connelly which currently has 8.3/10 stars on IMDB. Black Swan is also a movie directed by Darren Aronofsky which is very similar to Perfect Blue. It also stars Natalie Portman in that movie.For those of you who haven't seen the movie, watch both the English Dub & the English Sub. I only saw the English Dub, & it was good. But remember, your alter ego will keep an eye on you.OVERALL: 10/10",Perfect Blue
117,milkshakeboom,Psychological Thriller Classic For ANY Genre,10,6 March 2001,"Psychological thrillers are not easy to pull off.  Look over the last 10 years and you'd be hard-pressed to find half-a-dozen or more that have truly been what could be considered ""successful"" on the level they should be successful at:  keeping the viewer on edge, wondering how the story will pan out, wondering even if what they are seeing is real or imagined through the elements within the story.  The best psychological thrillers are those that psych the viewer out as much as the protagonist.  That's why ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is revered as a classic.  That's why ""Copycat"" was a sleeper success.And that's why I think ""Perfect Blue"" is a masterpiece.For those who are anime fans and for those who can get past the stigma of this film being anime and watch it nonetheless, this is a must-see film. The storyline is a terrific statement mirroring the celebrity-obsessed society we all live in, and the characters are given such vitality and believability with every line they speak.  Mami's struggles internally and externally, compounded by an apparent stalker and her crumbling emotional state, cause confusion not only for herself, but for the viewer not quite paying enough attention.  This is a film that may need two viewings to be fully understood, and even then perhaps some elements can be filled in by the viewer to make sense.  That is not a bad thing.The box art quotes a reviewer as saying this film would be the result of Hitchcock and Disney collaborating on a movie.  I think nothing more apropos can be said about ""Perfect Blue"".  It is a masterpiece.",Perfect Blue
118,sqrt_-1,Excellent Anime with surprising content,8,28 April 2001,I've picked up and put down this movie several times in the past. Boy am I glad I finally saw it!! This is an excellent anime! My previous best anime was 'Ninja Scroll' but this story beats it all. I'd say this is in the same set as the best of Hitchcock's movies. The plot is intrigueing and magnetic. The movie is fast moving and thoroughly enjoyable on a mental level. There is just enough switching between real/imagined to keep you riveted. Enough to make you doubt your own understanding at times. There are no scenes in bad taste and little real? violence. I'd recommend this to non-anime movie watchers as well. It made a pleasant change to the 'normal' mega-warrior - and - robots image of so many anime. My next DVD acquisition.,Perfect Blue

124,Luke-Walker,Something is very wrong.,10,30 July 2002,"The movie starts out like some small-scale drama about a boring pop singer wanting to become an actress and so leaves her band. So far so unoriginal. Or is it? Realistically I should have been thinking that while watching this movie, but I wasn't. Because something was horribly horribly wrong. There was a sense of foreboding so strong in this film it was almost tangible. It was also extremely captivating and tense. I cant really describe it any other way, just that the film had me hooked from the get go. I knew something was wrong, and then the murders started happening. Oh wow.
never before have I seen a film switch just like that. What started as a creepy drama suddenly turned into a gut-wrenching, disturbing yet highly engrossing. The sick nature of the film is not for everyone, but those that can stomach it will be amazed beyond belief at how tense and scary this film becomes. It is horrible, but it is entertaining, a contradictory I dont think I like, but cannot help.No one under 18 should watch this film. Not because of the content, but also because I dont really believe they're going to understand it. there are no monsters or giant robots.

125,MarkyMarkus,Excellent psychological thriller,10,23 May 2014,"I am a bit late to the party with this review, its been over a decade since this movie came out... scratch that, 17 years! but after seeing it, I couldn't help but not review it. The story is about a pop idol, Mima Kirigoe, who leaves the singing bushiness to pursue acting. This move to acting and the scenes she takes part it gets her attention from her stalker. The film centers around her paranoia. Perfect Blue is a fascinating movie. You never really know what is going on nor whether or not yo can believe what you are seeing. It has this tension surrounding it that can make even the most mundane scenes seem terrifying. The violence is brutal but effective, and I can honestly say I was glued to the screen the whole time. It has almost a Hitchcock feel to it. On the technical aspects, its pretty good. The animation gets its job done, but it's nothing spectacular. The sound and music do a good job of creating tension. The dub... well, if that's the way you want to go, it's not bad. Aside from a couple awkward voice actors, most do a good job, especially the lead. This is a film that I would recommend to anyone, assuming they are OK with the more graphic scenes. It's and excellent physiological thriller that must be seen.",Perfect Blue
126,hollyrowanmoore,"Surreal plot line, with a twist of madness.",9,12 April 2020,"This film shocked and surprised me as it was not at all what I was expecting. I'd read reviews and summaries saying how it was one of the most scary and shocking anime films ever made, and I just assumed this was due to the intensity of the violence, sex and surrealism. However, what I discovered was a beautiful film that in full depth showed viewers the dangers of fans, fame and how easy it is to lose your grip on reality. I was quite confused for most of the film, but by the end I had my perfect idea of what had happened. The director has cleverly created the work with a slightly open interpretation, so viewers could decide for themselves whether it was all imagination or a sense of idolisation that had grown dangerous. I would recommend this film 100%, as not only is it one of the greatest pieces of anime ever, but it is also a tense view into a much darker world within our society. I personally didn't find it scary or any of the scenes to be highly graphic or disturbing, but the psychological element of the film was what was most intense.",Perfect Blue
127,Iria,What is Perfect Blue?,8,16 October 1999,"What a great film.  I'm not being sarcastic, I really mean it.  This anime made me panic even though I didn't realize I was so tense.  The animation didn't really impress me, but I can't recall any other anime that screwed around with my mind as much as this one did (including Akira and Ghost in the Shell).  While that didn't sound exactly like a compliment, I'll just say that the entire film was riveting.Of course, this is not a ""family film.""  It's a disturbing psychotic masterpiece.  I could discuss the philosophical parallels, irony, the intense depth of the film, etc., but what I say doesn't really mean anything for those who haven't seen the film.  In addition, opinions of this film will be, I expect, widely varied.  Some people will think it was a waste of their time.  Others will be confused.I agree, there are times when I don't think I'd want to see this film.  It's not something that'll make you laugh (well...except Mima's extraordinary ability with computers), but rather, make you think just because the way the film is styled forces you to.  The film plays with emotions; there were times when I felt disgusted, embarrassed, horrified, and sadness simultaneously.But the film will never be a waste of my time, because I truly appreciate the cumulative efforts of those involved in the creation of ""Perfect Blue"" to create a film of such mental assault that I sat stunned, in my seat, when it was all over.  No other film I have seen has done as much.I was left so numbed that I didn't even realize that the title still doesn't mean anything to me until just now.So, what is ""Perfect Blue""?",Perfect Blue
128,dogg01,Third greatest anime of all time!,9,11 June 2001,"On the cover of this film, Roger Corman is quoted as saying ""If Alfred Hitchcock partnered with Walt Disney they'd make a picture like this."" He couldn't be more right.The story is about a pop idol Mima, who is sheding her squeaky-clean image for that of an actress. Along the way, she is raped onscreen for a sleazy television show, and does a nude shoot for a men's magazine. This makes her dirty, as her old self tells her. She finds a web site detailing every intimate little detail in her life, and believes that she is being stalked by a strange man. Her personality splits in two, into herself and her old, clean, self which tries to murder her. While she is battling her old self, all of those who contributed to her downfall are being grusomely murdered.
This movie has been critisized by others on this very site, saying that the film was boring in the first 40 minutes. How wrong they are. In Hitchcock's films, (take Psycho for example) he builds up character for the first half-hour until the slashing. This does the same, because if we were not built up to believe that Mima's character is not real-i.e 3-dimensional, then we would feel no sense of loss and disorientation when all hell breaks loose in Mima's life (and the editing room).A first class film with twists all the way. Should be seen by any movie fan with a mature mind. Even though it will probably collect dust in the anime section of the video store.5/5 Only beaten in the anime stakes by Ghost in the Shell (2nd) and Akira (1st). Pure genius.",Perfect Blue
129,yshaibushira,Perfect,10,29 September 2020,"As the first film from his hands, Shtosi Kon had created something that is not only clever, but one of the greatest movies of all time. Lwt me tell you why:The story: In itself, the story focuses around Mima and her decition of becoming an actor instead of a pop star. This decition would ultimitly change her life and what others thinks about her. As the story would progress, it would connect anything togerther in such a smart way, but also engaging to see how it would reveal. This result of the film to be crazy, but also very clever to make everything edgy, but in all the right places.The animation: as it is from japenes, there are some things that would be familiar about the animation. An example of that is in the character animation. Sometimes it looks limited, but when there is action needed, the animation would get a bust to show how it can be so amazingly redored. The backgrounds maintain a lot of detail to show how big this town is and colors are more limited to show the tone. But there are soke minor problems with the animation, like some of the designs with thr eyes away from each other makes them look a bit uncanny. But other than that little detail, the animation is something to admire.The characters: since the script is so clever and well done, the characters are also well devoloped and well crafted. For Mina, she carry a lot of character devolopment when she dicover about this decition of her, when everything would feel even too much for her. As for the others, they do have a point her. Some of them are happy with her choices and some would say that it ruines her image. And then there is the stalker himself, he is a deformed psycopath that has no form of reality, he creates another Mina and just makes her even question herself. The characters are so well devoloped and unique that they feel like they have a soul and are real peopole.Perfect blue is like its title says: its perfect. With an amzingly smart script, animation that is really real, and characters that are so good that they feel like real peopole.

132,ryan-bfd,Thoughtfull psychological thriller that leaves you disoriented and maybe even disturbed,9,7 March 2016,"Perfect Blue is a psychological thriller about a singer in a pop trio, Mima, who turns to acting because of the lack of successes that she feels she is achieving in music. Ironically, after she leaves her former singing partners become far more successful as a duo than they have ever been working with her. As Mima turns towards acting, she discovers that a stalker has been making posts about her on his fan-page detailing Mima's day-to day experience as she transitions to acting. These things began to manifest themselves in Mima's mind and embody a separate personality that haunts her throughout this film. I am not usually drawn to anime but this film really poked at my curiosity. Mostly because of the stories I have heard about the esteemed director, Darren Aronofsky, buying the rights to this film for $60k in order to, not only replicate a seen from this film in his critically-acclaimed masterpiece, Requiem for a Dream, but also to allegedly replicate aspects of Perfect Blue in his Oscar-winning movie, Black Swan. At first, I was kind of confused about why he did this. But after watching Perfect Blue, I can kind of see why. This film is one of the most intense and disorienting films that I have seen in a while. So it's understandable that a director trying to achieve the same unique effect would try to mimic this movie. We see Mima's alternative personality, 'pop-star Mima', eat this woman inside-out. Mima moves toward more smutty and gritty content in her new acting career. She is playing a girl that gets raped in the new television series she has been cast in, she is letting a photographer take nude photos of her, and she is slowly retreating into more and more into her own mind while doing so. All while her former co-stars are gaining success without her. This causes this her stalker and her alternative personality that is manifesting her consciousness to become more invasive and violent. This film, at times, allows us to feel the same sort of disorientation and confusion that Mima is feeling, especially with the twist ending that leaves you thinking about this film long after it is finished. There is a portion of the movie where Mima keeps waking up from a sleep after each scene, as to suggest that everything that happened before was just a dream. This sequence left me so confused and the pacing made me so dizzy that I thought I was going to fall out of my seat. There are a lot of scenes in this film where you start to question what is real and what isn't. Perfect Blue is stylistically unsettling and memorizing, but still beautifully animated and edited. The film's score is unnerving. The English-dubbed vocal-performances don't sound out-of-place or corny like they do in most anime. I like how mature this film is. It intensifies until the very end without trying to break the tension with any humor or explain things to the audience. It is a dark look into the psychological darkness of being a pawn in the world of pop- culture. I hope to find some more anime like this in the future. I think that this film is a good stepping stone for anyone who is trying to get into anime. If you are trying to watch something that may keep you up at night, if you are trying to watch something that is thought provoking, if you like films with a complex plot and storyline watch this film. You won't regret it.",Perfect Blue
133,boclani,Japan's hidden masterpiece,10,23 November 2016,"Watch the visual review here - https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=rDcw_MCYs-MPERFECT BLUE, is an psychological thriller anime surrounding Mima, who decides she wants to become an actress because she is tired of the pop artist world, when she becomes this actress she repeatedly degrades herself by allowing herself to do scenes that she would never have thought of doing before, all the while murders take place that seem to relate to her, while she is also followed by an overly obsessed fan and her pop-artist self in the form of a ghost. People are worried for her as she starts to loose her grip on reality. And this all correlates to develop this extremely intense, dark and strikingly gorgeous animated film. The movie also was a huge inspiration to Black Swan and Requim for a Dream with some scenes looking almost identical. And if these highly commended films got inspiration from this, you better believe the hype.Perfect Blur has deep messages, one of the messages mentioning how fans can be over-obsessive and try to take possession of their favored celebrities. As fans start attacking her mentally and physically it makes Mima do what the fans want her to do and go back to singing. This is the main aspect of the movie that drives her to lose her mind. I'm not going to say anymore as I will probably end up spoiling it!Perfect Blue is an incredibly smart piece of work that tricks you, throughout it you are left wondering if what you saw was real. It shows Mima's dreams, the show and the reality. One scene for example, that was nicely acted and well shot, Mima is acting in her show, but you can tell she gives more emotion than anyone else, because the scenes that she acts in, reflects different parts of her life and some of those scenes are showed later in the movie. Sometimes we get details about Mima's life when you suddenly realise it was being read out by one of the actors of the show when the camera pans a bit to the right, adding to the confusion of what is fact and fiction.It also makes you think of different ways and outcomes of how the movie will end, but the movie knows what you're thinking and swerves around the normal movie clichés.And from start to finish I was so intrigued by this attention to detail, like how the film is created like we are Mima, we are loosing our mind with her, as some scenes aren't placed in chronological order and some scenes cut without characters finishing their sentences and only parts of the picture is showed at times, making our mind believe we are in one place, when we are actually somewhere else. And this wasn't an editing issue, this is all part of the effect.Different colours along the duration of the movie have different meaning, for example, the prominent colour of red popping up everywhere symbolises, what I think, her madness. If you look at the movie in this way, in certain scenes it gets more and more evident and disturbing, while in a poetic way. Some scenes near the end reminded me of the famous shower scene in Hitchcock's Psycho. Trust me when I say that you will be awed by the beautifully made film. It reminded me of some of the great movies out there like Fight Club and The Sixth Sense, and how they add and remove little coloured items from scenes to symbolise what the movie is trying to tell us. Keep in mind that The Sixth Sense was praised for its attention to detail when it was release in 1999. Yeah, this movie was released in 1997, they did the seemingly new colour scheme story telling before The Sixth Sense. If it isn't evident already, in many ways, movies created now days have followed the Perfect Blue strategy in one way or another. As I have said before, it is praised upon by genius film directors. I just find that really cool, alright back to the review.The film continually asks questions and answers only the questions needed to be answered as it does leave the ending up to your own interpretation, but it kind of takes a bit of researching to figure out the possible endings as there are multiple. Every scene has its own story and is important and adds up to something in the long run.Perfect Blue has been criticised lately on its quality of video saying it's not up to par with anime made recently in the 2010s'. Well duh! It hasn't been remastered at all, so of course the picture will be a bit washed out and not the standard of 2010s' animations. People actually want to see this movie as the same old anime with huge eyes, fan service and short high pitch gasps. But this is a very mature and realistic animation and at times I actually forgot I was watching an animation! You don't get that in most movies in this same genre surpassing the creative standards like Perfect Blue has.This anime has touching, shocking and amazing scenes that are well paced to have surprisingly good performances that go well with an incredible score, masterful imagery and editing, breaks the fourth wall for a second, hidden details in every scene while holding together a brilliant and compelling story with an enormous amount of replay value. I can't stop praising this film, I personally didn't have any huge problems with this movie and is actually one of the best films I've ever seen.A+Watch the visual review here - https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=rDcw_MCYs-M",Perfect Blue
134,Muzman,High quality,9,18 December 2001,"( spoilers lie within. ) I've been hoping for an anime like this to reach these shores for ages. Despite the sci-fi fantasy and giant robots the genre is famous for, it's perfectly capable of making any sort of film.  Take Wings of Honneamise for example; basically a sweet drama about the first space program of a (spectacularly designed) fictional world.  It was around ten years ago that story appeared in the West, now Perfect Blue ably picks up the mantle.  And it's probably the best psychological thriller I've seen for a long time, filmed or drawn.Much has been said about it along the lines of ""Hitchcock goes to Japan"" and it's not far wrong.  Most of what people call thrillers these days are actually over cooked detective stories.  However helpless or innocent the protagonists, they usually operate with the resources and/or sanction and authority of some official body, be it the cops or the FBI or someone else. These stories can be great, but there's something more thrilling about fairly ordinary folks with no such know-how dropped into horrible situations.  It's hard tale to spin and none did better or more often than Hitchcock.  Now we have an anime proving it can cut it in this tough sub genre.The story, as if you didn't read the front page, goes like this: Mima is a sheltered girl, living in a protective publicity bubble as a member of the squeaky clean J-pop trio called Cham.  They've had some modest success and have a good following, but haven't really got off the ground in a major way. At a small comic fair appearance she announces her retirement from the group to pursue acting.  When she gets home she starts getting strange phone calls and faxes.  She also fumbles her way onto the internet after being rattled by an obtuse, but innocent, fan letter.  There she discovers a web site put up by someone speaking as her, detailing everything about her life right down to her thoughts and regrets about her new job, her superstitious habits and her every purchase.  As things go along it seems without the group she really is a nobody.  The acting isn't an instant success.  Her standards begin to slip in grabs for acceptance and publicity.  And under the weight of the job, fear, regret and loneliness she gradually cracks up. Then people around her start dying.This film is brilliantly put together.  In the slow and deliberate early stages we watch her uneventful life for a while, pushing for more air time in a drama series and a few mildly unsettling moments (letter bomb aside), nothing much happening really.  Then we're slammed in the face.  The script even foreshadows it beautifully; ""Mima, your character undergoes a psychological transformation after a brutal gang rape in a nightclub"".  Then we watch them film it; take after take, camera set up after set up, long lurid close ups for what seems like forever.  The crew and production staff seem slightly ashamed, to say nothing of her managers.  People in the audience are turning away.  I'm one of them, but I have to grin about how damn brilliant this is.  It's just an unevenly dubbed cartoon isn't it? Well this is just the start of the rollercoaster ride.  The effectiveness of this also speaks volumes about the character development, notable in Mima herself and her managers.  Handling this sheltered and delicate personality whilst trying to do their job and get her work and publicity in an unforgiving business (to say nothing of the fact that the rest of Cham are still with the agency and are starting to become quite a breakthrough success).  It's all very well done.  Another example; when her vague and hallucinatory behaviour seems to be getting too intense and prolonged (despite the rape scene and other things) the explanation is handed to us, perfectly timed.  She's been reading the stalker web site religiously as a sort of emotional crutch.  While the site itself has slowly changed tone to one of describing (as her) the kind of life she should have had.  And she starts to agree, or maybe she is updating it.As others have noted, this film seems to echo a couple of reality bending films, beating them to the punch in some cases.  Requiem for a Dream, Memento and even Fight Club spring to mind. The former involving dreams, ideals and regrets sitting alongside a slide into usettling seediness (and stealing a great moment shot for shot from Perfect Blue, as others also note), the latter two having scenes that are confusingly without proper context or meaning until a bit later in the film and generally being about losing your self and forgetting what you have or have not done. 
Although I found the ending a little awkward (they usually are in this kind of film) I didn't see it coming and it does sit well with everything else. The light epilogue being another somewhat Hitchcockian touch.  Don't let all my comparisons distract though.  It's a damn fine film in its own right.  I imagine it's even better with the original dialogue.  See it on the big screen if you can.",Perfect Blue
135,casualist,"Perfect Blue is a fever dream, in the best way possible",10,31 December 2019,"The movie starts like any teen/young adult anime, but the twists and turns make it incredibly unsettling as time goes on. It's gory, creepy, paranoid, and explicit. Perfect Blue doesn't sugarcoat stalkers and the hardships that come with being a celebrity, especially when going through a career change. I'd say the first half of the film focuses more on the way Mima deals with leaving her pop idol days behind, fact that damages her mental health and makes the main action of the movie start. This is where the stalker fan comes into play, and also where the film becomes increasingly surreal. With all the time warping and the inconsistencies in character behavior, Perfect Blue remains mysterious enough to keep viewers on the edge of their seats until the final minute. The ending was unexpected and open-ended, which is something I really liked. The movie doesn't hold your hand through anything and doesn't explain any of its events; you have to figure it out on your own. It definitely made me lose a few hours of sleep.",Perfect Blue
136,Spinal-Column,"Not quite Perfect, but still a great movie",7,30 January 2003,"The first time I watched PERFECT BLUE I was underwhelmed. I disliked what I perceived to be the 'supernatural' element of the movie. I watched it again several months later, intending to get rid of my DVD, and realised that I had missed the whole point of the film!PERFECT BLUE is actually a very good, intelligent movie. Director, Satoshi Kon, was employed to make an exploitation flick using the original PERFECT BLUE novel as his source material. Kon disliked the script the studio provided and, when he asked how rigidly he had to stick to the plot, was told that he had to keep three elements of the story: a singing idol, a stalker and horror. Using these elements he and writer Sadayuki Murai created what is effectively a coming-of-age story about a young woman leaving one stage of her life and entering another.The plot can seem contrived and the ending is a little silly (though it is quite meaningful when looking at the film as a story about growing up). Also the animation is not too great -this was only a straight to video feature, after all. However, if you can get past these problems, this is a very enjoyable movie.7/10",Perfect Blue

If you've watched Black Swan you will definitely see a lot of similarities, which is because this film was an inspiration for it. It illustrates the mental toll of fame and the warning to never trust ""friends"" who will exploit you for fame. There are multiple twists in the film, lots of honest brutality that does not hold back, and when it all comes together makes a truly satisfying ending.I would highly recommend giving this classic a view, even if you're not an anime fan.

138,veed_santos,Reality of fantasy?,8,17 April 2010,"First of all, this movie will confuse you and it will make you think, it might even screw with your mind because the plot isn't exactly simple or easy. Those that say that got it all figured out ever since the beginning are lying. This is a psychological thriller that knows how to make use of suspense and how to mix reality and fantasy to the point of confusing the viewer while developing a complex and concise plot. It's really a murder mystery filled with twists that will throw some fake hints at you, with a great direction and very powerful scenes that contribute to the nature of this movie. This movie is for adults, seriously, we are dealing with nudity, a rape scene, explicit violence, gore and a very complex plot, so please... take that into consideration.Overall I really enjoyed this movie, it's a suspense and mystery ride with a very intelligent plot and an ending that while it will make you initially think that the whole thing didn't make any sense, if you think carefully about all the little details everything ends up making perfect sense. It's one of those movies that might require a second viewing. Doesn't get a perfect 10 from me because in spite of being original and a masterpiece in the anime media, out of it, it's nothing new.",Perfect Blue
139,DimasDarko,"""Perfect Blue""",10,30 December 2020,"Just recently I was studying and analyzing art pieces from all mediums. music, films, miniseries, ETC: Anime was a medium of art I'm not at all too fond of. I thought the genre had an overabundance of clichés, and i was very turned off by the lack of original writing anime had to offer. ""Perfect Blue"" was anime that I loved when I initially watched it around 5 months ago. It had everything I wanted an anime to be, and It quickly became one of my favorite anime art pieces of all time. I decided to come back to this movie recently because it was one of the art pieces i put on my list to analyze, And everything just started to hit me with waves of intense euphoria.""Perfect blue"" Has some of the most intense feelings of dread, anguish, and anxiety. the story I felt was incredibly important critiquing things like fandom, the idle industry, selling out, and men expectations of women being sexually exploited. I was enamored by the detail and precision of the writing and filmmaking. I initially thought the style and presentation of the film felt a bit dated, but after a rewatch it felt as if it worked for the piece itself making for a more authentic and desperate feel.This film today is incredibly relevant and refreshing. the topics and the style exhibit some of the most progressive and forward-thinking ideas for animes at the time.

141,Rogziel,"""The color of illusion is Perfect Blue""",8,4 January 2005,"Mima is part of the pop idol trio Cham, which has a cult following but no chart-topping hits. For the sake of her career, Mima is pressured by her management into giving up singing and becoming an actress. Unfortunately her squeaky-clean pop idol image is holding her back, and Mima reluctantly agrees to a nude photo shoot and the role of a rape victim in an erotic thriller. But some of Mima's fans from her Cham days do not like this ""new"" Mima, and she starts receiving threatening letters and faxes that call her a traitor. Worse yet, she discovers a website called ""Mima's Room"" that describes her daily routine in disturbingly accurate detail. Mima suspects she is being stalked, but that may be the least of her problems when the people around her start being murdered, and Mima herself has dreams about being the killer.Perfect Blue is an unusual anime film because it did not have to be animated. This psychological thriller could very well work as a live action film, but the animation gives it a unique style that works very well with the movie's central theme of illusion vs. reality. Director Satoshi Kon puts the viewer right in Mima's shoes, and as she is overwhelmed by pressure and her mounting fear, the audience is right there with her as she becomes disoriented. Is she dreaming, or are the terrible events surrounding her real? Is she perhaps being manipulated by an outside force? The repeated shots of Mima suddenly waking up, along with several scenes being presented from different perspectives, keep the viewer from being certain of what is real and what is fantasy. It is an effective, if eventually tiresome, technique.Some have complained that the nudity in this film was not ""erotic"" enough, which is very disappointing considering that the nudity comes from two rape scenes (one simulated, the other real) and a photo shoot that is intended to be a ""rape"" of a different kind. The violence is also shocking considering how innocently the film begins, but the murders are appropriately brutal.Unfortunately, Perfect Blue does keep up its momentum, and while the ending does not ruin the film it's formulaic and a bit too upbeat considering what preceded it. Still, repeated viewings make it clear that not everything was tied up in a little bow, and perhaps there was more truth than illusion in Mima's nightmares.",Perfect Blue
142,kaplara,Why this movie should be in the top 250 if not the top 100.,9,26 January 2005,"There are perhaps few instances in film where the viewer can truly say something is superior in an animated format then in a live action shot. Grave of the Fireflies is one such masterpiece, this is another.The basic storyline is as follows, a young girl travels from the countryside to the city, where she dreams of being a singer. After some fairly good success with a group named Cham, she gets the opportunity to switch from music to movies. Is this what she really wants? It wasn't what she came to do, but who doesn't aspire to such heights? Unfortunately in order to make the transition she must go through a degrading rape scene, which after some thought she does. As her career moves forward she indeed takes a strong lead in the television series she had been a one time cameo on. But what of the little girl still trapped inside her? What of the new found success of Cham upon her leaving? As the main character breaks down she begins to see things, notably herself, hating her for what she has become. As people on the set begin to die, and her life more and more mimics the show on which she acts, she loses track of reality.In a world of lies you tell to others, lies others tell to you, and lies you tell yourself, who can you trust? Who is a killer? Is there a killer at all? Who are your friends and who are you enemies? Who are you? Perfect Blue is a thriller. This movie will make you guess, on no other medium can I imagine the splits being so well done, the breaks from reality so fluidly incomprehensible and at the same time so accurately formed. Best of all not a step is missed, on multiple watches you will be wowed, not a hair out of place, seamless.

148,shaye22,"Suspenseful, compelling and entertaining animated thriller that succeeds on its own despite similarities with other films",8,1 January 2012,"Perfect Blue has seen a resurgence of interest after the recent success of Darren Aronofsky's similar Black Swan and many film-goers note that the latter was clearly influenced by the former, and it really does come across when one compares the films: they both center around an art (acting vs. dancing) and a paranoid, attractive and driven woman who gradually descends into paranoid delusions because of her obsessive commitment to the art form, in Perfect Blue an aspiring actress, in Black Swan a ballerina. Both films are wonderful and each hold up very well on their own, however I would say that the similarities between the two films are probably mostly superficial and don't really extend beyond the blurring of reality and fantasy theme and the doppelganger ""who's who?"" element. I'd also say that Black Swan was more emotionally wrenching than Perfect Blue.I saw Perfect Blue recently and I enjoyed the film. It's very engrossing and the animation is superb. It's the type of film you'd have if you mixed Roman Polanski, Hitchcock and some Lynch and then teamed it up with Disney. The film particularly recalls the paranoid work of Polanski (Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, The Tenant) and the dream-like, surreal state of many of Lynch's films (Mulholland Drive, Inland Empire). Perfect Blue, despite being influenced by probably superior and more sophisticated works, is a very innovative work that succeeds extremely well as its own piece.

The fact that the finest 90's pop-trash music is booming at the beginning makes me - an old nostalgic - a little bit happier.In any case, ""Perfect Blue"" has convinced me.

The beginning was really dragging on, many characters seemed stereotypical (sure, it's always the nerd and the fat woman behind everything) and the main character appeared superficial. The ending was also very disappointing: just as things started to get really good it turned into an average scene where a maniac is chasing an innocent girl, moreover, the last episode was just corny.However, this anime did have some excellent parts. The scenes where reality gets mixed up with dreams and Mima's role in the movie were marvelous.

Perfect Blue combines an Alfred Hitchcock style horror turn based into this beautiful unravelling thriller. Junko Iwao plays Mima Kirigoe, the ex pop idol leaving the band Cham (english version) who now sets of on a career in the acting. Rumi (Rica Matsumoto), and Tadokoro (Shinpachi Tsuji) are Mima's agents and land her a role in a TV drama being made, where Mima loses the innocence that was provided with her as a pop singer, and once a rape seen his filmed, Mima starts to have paranoid feelings, with hallucination's, and on top of this (Masaaki Ôkura) Uchida the fan becomes more of the obsessing fan. It's my personal favourite anime movie, and i hope that this has helped people and encouraged them to see it.

The device of ""is this scene real?...No, it's a dream/movie/TV series"" was repeated, and repeated, and repeated ad nauseum. Despite this conceit, the story is actually fairly linear, although still fairly crazy.What makes this a disturbing anime is much of the imagery. There's a dizzying scene of a movie rape scene, and people bleeding from stabs in the eyes. But the ""pop-star self"" of the heroine, wearing outfits the color of candy, flitting around in cotton-candy mini-skirts, shrieking, and so on, upset me...although this may be my own fetish. The scene of the dead fish is also freaky.I have more criticisms. The Mimaniac (clever name), a stalker, is silent throughout most of the movie. Near the end, he talks, and ruins his air of menace. The end is very, very tame compared with the graphic, confusing, psyche-shattering events preceding it.In short: an obsessed anime, executed with enough technical skill to make it nasty.",Perfect Blue

Unlike Millennium Actress, Kon never manages to build an emotional connection between the viewer and the characters, leaving a dispassionate barrier.Barred beneath a plot of tasteless sand there may be a glimpse of sentiment that could warrant artistic expression- unfortunately, those who crafted this mechanically orchestrated opera didn't believe in that sentiment enough to imbue any great worth or artistic beauty when rendering it.At the hart of the Perfect Blue is the question: do I like who I've become? Satoshi Kon wraps that question in a package of insanity and couples it with the warn out tedium of a psycho killer.

161,Emma286,Not for those looking for easy anime viewing,7,11 September 2008,"For anybody hoping for an anime with a straightforward easy to understand storyline upon their first view, I would not recommend this movie. You will be disappointed. However for those looking something thought provoking, I would enthusiastically say ""give it a go!"" Perfect Blue is one of those films which  if simply taken at face value  is only too easy to misunderstand. To begin with, on the surface, it appears to be a typical story about a young upcoming pop idol/actress  Mima  who is being stalked due to the fan attention her career in the public eye is bringing her. But then as events move forward suddenly things become very confusing, to the point they appear to make no kind of logical sense at all. By the time you reach the end you might well be left with the thought, as I initially was, ""What a jumbled up mess that turned out to be."" But this really is an anime which can only be appreciated how it was supposed to be if you're willing to watch it with an open mind, and consider that it might take you a few viewings before you're likely to understand it properly. The clues which take you to a clearer conclusion as to how the different story elements add up are present within the movie, but easily missed if you're unwilling to think about the visual information presented to you from any alternative perspective. It's not enough just to follow what's happening on-screen, but from time to time also ask yourself questions about your initial judgements on the scenes.Though initially my thoughts were different, I now think that this anime has been very cleverly put together. It's by no means the scariest film I've seen or the best animated. And when it comes to some of the voice dubbing and the ending scene I still feel there's much room for improvement. But overall I still feel that the film works fantastically as a psychological thriller, and has the right kind of eerie/disturbing atmosphere throughout to define it as a classic amongst its kind.I give it a 7 out of 10!",Perfect Blue

If her agent is the ""singer Mima"", how does she not recognize her? Are they both getting crazy? Who killed the Mimaniac? The ending was really disapointing, I would have rater liked it if it was Mima who was seing the ghost, and not the ghost being her agent. That doesn't make a lot of sense.",Perfect Blue

Its amazing sound design and claustrophobic visuals accentuate the tension and the amazing voice acting performances make the characters feel real.Very few movies have had me as on edge as Perfect Blue made me. Throughout the film tension is subtly and slowly raised and, as with the main character, starts to get to you. During the final act all the built up tension bursts into one of the most intense sequences I've ever seen in a movie.The ending is also just one of my favorite as it ties up the story in a nice little bow.

We are not one person, we are many people who go by the same name.Though all of us deal with this in varying ways as we go through life, nowhere is it more of an issue than in pop culture. The long list of psychologically and emotionally fractured ex-teen stars is ample proof. ""Who are you?"" Mima, the central character in Perfect Blue, asks of herself. It is her first line in our 'play within a play.' It is a question that really seeks no answer, instead expressing the complete lack of a frame of reference.Just a decade after its release some of the devices of this film may now seem old - websites pretending to portray the 'real life' of pop idols, obsessive paparazzi, frothing J-pop fans - however, many of the questions explored by Perfect Blue remain as vital as ever.

This isn't an action movie, it's comedy, it's not shojou, it's a psychological thriller / horror / mystery. In the past directors such as Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell) of incorporating psychological drama into their films, however these films remain action films at their core, the action is fundamental to the entertainment value of these movies. With Perfect Blue on the other hand it is the psychological elements which are the core of this film. As great is this movie is, no movie is for everyone. Perfect Blue is very heavy material in many ways. The mature content and psychological violence isn't suitable for all, this definitively isn't for kids, and some adults might find it disturbing too. Additionally this movie is heavy thought material, it's easy to get confused by it, so save the movie for a night when you're in the mood to think, not merely be entertained.",Perfect Blue
175,kiwing94,"Good animation, interesting story, complex and overambigious narration and inconsistent art.",5,25 July 2014,"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156887/ This was an very deep anime movie, I think I begin to understand why it's called Perfect Blue, Perfect Blue might mean that the sea is deep and it is a parabel, metaphor for the film's message is deep, so assume that the color blue is deep, and when something is completely and deeply so it must be blue and perfect. In short, the movie is about the psycho logical aspects of schizophrenia and post-traumatic stress because she is a burned-out artist but choose to change your occupation to an actress, but then trying to broaden their fanbase by changing their image. She does this by sailing on the sea as a fashion model. This will of course not help, but she thinks she can change, believe that everything will be all right if she changes careers to something that may not be as hard for her. The film's director is not a master, because you did not really understand what was what in the film, they could have improved it so that you understand or that they had any character who could understand what was going on during the movie. Sometimes she dreamed, but then got it all the way out there, sometimes she dreamed or dreamed, she did not and then did not know the time horizon of the film. The ocean is deep ocean is deep .... The movie was boring because it stagnated in some places and it was not a success, the other negative I found with this film was that the film did not have a better description or illustration of the stalker in the film. Then you do not know even if it was a stalker or it was hallucinations from her. I'm not going to seek out theories on what people think, the movie gets 5 out of 10, good try to depict how a famous person affected by stalkers and how one becomes mentally unstable when you think you are exposed to stalkers. The film could have easily been an 8 out of 10 of the movie been easier to understand, and if the movie had a closure instead of an open ending where you need to figure out possible explanations for the ending. possibilities for what it could have been. Then I tried the film illustrate the psychological too complex, so it was not at all successful. The music was barely sufficient to make it scary. The animation looked realistic and well done for its time and budget they spent on the film. It was unique to attempt an advanced and complicated story about a famous pop singer who becomes mentally unstable. I still recommend it because you maybe will like it if you are into open endings and complex narration. The psychology aspect is very interesting though so that was the reason I wanted to watch this",Perfect Blue
176,bunnywuv_x3,Amazing.,7,10 February 2014,"I would first like to start off with the animation of ""Perfect Blue"". I really enjoyed it because it had that 'classic' feel to it. Like most animes made in the late 80's to 90's. The artwork wasn't horrid but is also wasn't over the top. Especially when the term pop-star is mentioned. If it was more modern. Then prepare for the overuse of stars and sparkles and pink. Lots and lots of pink, but it didn't have that. It was down to earth and i liked that about it a lot. Moving on, when the movie began I kind of drifted in and out because progress was moving so slow, but i was anxious to see what the obviously creepy, fish-eyed, gap toothed man in the crowd was going to do. I mean seriously. Who kept allowing that guy to attend all of Mima's shoots? Is there no security? But anyway, the guy was obviously a stalker and like most stalker films, I was expecting this guy to do what any other stalker would do. Run her life into the ground. But no PLOT TWIST. These tend to come out of nowhere in Perfect Blue. First we get the impression that Mima's going insane. Which is understandable considering what she's going through. But then the same hallucination that's tormenting Mima is floating around the obsessed fan and it made me think ""How is that possible?"" Soon I could no longer tell the difference between what was real and what was in Mima's head. Despite her obvious personality change no one gives two sh*ts. Mima basically walks around like a soulless doll and all they care about is the dumb movie.But enough of that. The ending is what got to me the most. Never would i have expected for the manager lady to be behind all of it. She was seriously the very last person I suspected. She showed no signs of being a psycho and was the only one who truly cared about Mima. Here I am waiting for the fish eyed dude to show up in Mima's apartment when she wakes up, but instead I get the total opposite. Disregarding the slow progress of the story in the beginning and the slight confusion, it was awesome and i recommend it. :) It keeps you guessing, on your toes and leave you in utter shock.",Perfect Blue
177,sasata-29793,Reality reclaimed in a rotting world,10,29 April 2018,"One of the singular most original animated films I have ever seen. The story is about an ex pop idol who wants to become a filmstar. On a social level, it deals with the obsession of the Japanese industry with violence 
and sexual exploitation, but what captivated me most was its use of dream sequences. 
Dream sequences, or various variations of those, are not exactly a new theme. However, in most cases, they do not follow the dream logic to the extreme. Often they reduce to the common world rationality on some level, or tend to clearly distinguish between reality and dreams. However, for me, Kon's film grew organically into a film where the reality smoothly becomes the illusion, as the protagonist falls increasingly into a nighmarish reality. In my opinion, it would be very interesting to have an analysis of the film from the perspective of technological revolution, that analyzes the world of Satoshi Kon's imagination as a product of the tech bubble. To my distinction, the film managed to overcome a story to become existential in nature; pertaining questions on the nature of reality and the distinction between fiction and fact. At its best, it stayed on the level of some of Borges' finest fictions and evoked questions regarding nature of the 'lost' reality in our present age.",Perfect Blue
178,chucky-9,A new type of japanimation,10,6 March 1999,"This is a very good Japanese animation film considering that many of Japanese animation are craps.  The general characteristics of japanimation- stupid comedy, meaningless violence, sexuality, and science fiction setting- are not present in this film.  Director Satoshi Kon has incorporated surreal setting, serious plot, and stylish presentation technique into this psycho-horror, a genre which animation has never stepped into.  Although there are some violence and sexually explicit scenes involved (I wonder if the US market would accept this film), they do not spoil the film, but rather enhance it.  By effectively exposing character's psychological change to the audience, the film really draws you in.  Perfect Blue gives you a new kind of impression that other japanimations are not capable of.",Perfect Blue
179,Sugiru,superb psycho-thriller,10,26 July 1999,"Having seen PERFECT BLUE this past weekend, I'm amazed and delighted.It is a psycho-thriller worthy of Hitchcock, and if questioned on which film Hitchcock did, I'd have to say PSYCHO, of the 1950s.  One scene in the movie blows past even the famous shower-stabbing scene in PSYCHO.Overall, if one is not familiar with certain Japanese cultural conventions like Idol Singers, the ""pink trade"" and Japanese amusement parks, it might raise a lot of questions in the mind of the viewer, and --to be honest-- it begins very slowly like many Japanese anime/live action/OVAs normally do. At first, I was bored, and even disapointed since I had been anxiously awaiting seeing this full-length movie, but I was NOT to be disapointed for long!Non-Japanese-culture-familiar can easily follow the plot since enough is revealed in the plot that it becomes self-explaining as it _roars down on you like a freight train_ (!) once the obligatory opening scenes and character exposition is over.About 15 or 20 minutes into the movie, all hell breaks loose,and you wind up wondering if the heroine is a regular girl dreaming of being an Idol Singer (J girl pop-music groups), and then an actress, or an actress dreaming about being a pop-singer, or a pop singer dreaming of being an actress.   Are those the hallucinations of a sick mind, or the dreams of a young girl? Who's killing people, and why?  Who is the killer--her, or another, and is she in any danger herself?Surrealism...a thriller...a murder mystery like none I've ever seen..a real gasper when you _think_ you know who the killer is, but are they, and if so, who's doing all the rest of it?A true tour-de-force, and I cannot recomend it too highly.  After the slower early minutes of it, you will be on an emotional rollercoaster that you will never forget for the rest of your life, plus you will ask the question (frequently) of yourself, what actually _is_ ""reality"", during this movie.You will never be quite the same again after you see this one.",Perfect Blue

fact that damages her mental health and makes the main action of the movie start.This is where the stalker fan comes into play, and also where the film becomes increasingly surreal.With all the time warping and the inconsistencies in character behavior,
Perfect Blue remains mysterious enough to keep viewers on the edge of their seats until the final minute.The ending was unexpected and open-ended, which is something I really liked.The movie doesn't hold your hand through anything and doesn't explain any of its events; you have to figure it out on your own.It definitely made me lose a few hours of sleep.",Perfect Blue

Therefore, I'm writing two reviews: The review of it as an anime and the review of it as a movie.I'll start with the movie. This movie will appeal to anyone who enjoys a gripping, suspenseful mindbender.  While it's not the same as an Alfred Hitchcock flick; anyone who has enjoyed movies such as Memento, Fight Club, or Pi will enjoy it, regardless of whether or not they like anime.  It has the same flavor of demented reality that makes these other movies so good.  My main complaint about the movie is that the ending was inadequate.Now for the anime review: The animation is comparable to an average OVA (anyone who doesn't understand that should stop reading the review now).  However, this doesn't hurt the story, because Perfect Blue wasn't made to be eye candy; it was made for the plot.  The music was pretty standard fare, nothing too special about it. The music in this anime plays the same role music plays in most American movies; to add some feeling to a scene.  The voice acting was excellent in Japanese, but the dub, as usual, is horrible.  Nothing ruins a good anime more than a bad dub.Watch the movie.  You won't regret it.",Perfect Blue

It was a bad anime after all this effort to make it look like some kind of Hitchcock's movies. Even the crime was very regular. Maybe it's me, I was looking for a kind of ""Akira"" or ""Ghost in the Shell"" anime. I should read more before downloading. What?

There is nothing wrong with the storyline of PB. The fact that the killer 'looks' like Mima is not a fact. Mima's delusional paranoia is causing her to view a projection of herself, and her slipping grasp on reality is causing her to blur her movie scenes (eg, the pizza boy scene) with reality. That is how the killer can appear like Mima when Mima isn't around - we're not actually seeing the killer. We're seeing Mima, or her delusions.The CHAM thing doesn't make too much sense since they weren't that popular, but I'm sure the industry still views a struggling popstar as a bad choice for an acting role.So there.",Perfect Blue
197,ark_angel_27,The Best psychological thriller movie that will live on.,10,10 July 2011,"Well where to start. This movie is an all time favorite of mine. It has both the feeling of fear and being scared. Most people think that to be scared you have to show gore. Perfect Blue that the real fear is losing the sense of reality and fantasy, losing control is what we all fear and this movie shows it. Granted the gore in this movie is there but its done with style. Perfect Blue is one big emotional Roller Coaster ride of fear. When i first seen this movie I was guessing left and right on who the killer was and in the end of the film i was floored when i seen who was the killer. The visual appealing to the movie is fantastic, In one scene where mima's pop idol starts talking to her you can see the that the ""Pop idol"" was clean, pretty, and brighter, where as mima was had a dark color tone which represented what she did, posing nude, doing a rape scene. What i like about it too that this movie is that is shows how fans the react to mima doing something different or extreme. Mima's followers says that she was changing and they weren't fond of it. This shows that real people do that as well. This movie does show ""Art Imitating Life"" because we all criticize someone who radically changes there personality or the way they act or dress.Over all if you want to watch a great scary thriller, I recommend this anime movie to anyone, even the ones who don't watch anime. As far as thrillers, on my list, it doesn't beat my all time favorite thriller Silence of the Lambs but it does beat out the first Saw movie.",Perfect Blue
198,tadis90,My love to Satoshi Kon,10,28 May 2019,"Well, what can be said about this movie that hasn't been said. To me personally this movie is flawless. It is the embodiment of all the things that I love about the Asian cinema. It has the dark tone: emptiness, shallowness, hopelessness etc.Satoshi Kon is a visionary, his movies are ahead of their time, I know that both Perfect Blue and Paprika inspired many western movies such as Inception, Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream and many others. I love the way that he handles such complex story lines. If you can get through the layer of complexity you will soon realize that these movies are not complex just for being complex, these stories are a heavy commentary on how our society functions and how an individual functions in such society.Among many other topics, Perfect Blue touches on the double identity that almost every person assumes. The public persona and the private. It shows how chaotic can everything get once you lose track of which is which. It shows how even the seemingly perfect people can sometimes be perfectly lonely. Hence the title. Perfect Blue, which I think suggests perfect sadness.In my opinion this movie is timeless and the topics that it touches on are ever so relevant these days.

200,tokyowars,A worthwhile watch.,7,25 August 2005,"Contains slight SPOILERs but they are minor compared to what is revealed on the discussion boards!Perfect Blue. To many anime fans this title may be immediately recognized as one of the so-called classic anime of all time. I myself knew it held this distinction but never knew why as I had never had the opportunity to watch it. When I finally got hold of it I read a couple of reviews on the net about it. They stated that it was a very confusing film, which had no clear story line and switched between story lines too much. Now one of my friends happened to have a go at watching it before I did. He had his very young son on his lap and randomly flicked through the film to see what the animation was like (I'm guessing that's the reason anyway, since I do that myself). He happened to come upon a scene where a girl is getting raped. Since his son was watching the film with him, he immediately stopped the film and messaged me asking if I had watched it and did I know the content. When he told me what he had seen I was slightly shocked that a film, which contained a scene such as this, could be labeled a classic. (However there are films such as Ninja Scroll and Wicked City which contain scenes such as this and are still viewed as classics, so I wasn't totally surprised.) I knew then I had to watch the film, if only to decide whether to keep it or get rid of it I'm a hoarder so this is a very important decision!). While I was watching the film I had in mind the rape scene so my viewing was slightly tainted. The film itself is what I would classify as a psycho-thriller? It was slightly creepy/scary in parts but in a mental freak out kind of way. The story did kind of flick around a bit but from the way I understand the film, that was the intention. Towards the end of the film you are left questioning whether what you have been shown as reality is in fact reality or could it be that it is a film within a film (a tribute to Shakespeare's Hamlet perhaps?) It was in the vein of M. Night Shyamalan's movies such as 'The Village'. There was a lot of implied 'scariness' and encouraged your brain to make up the rest. It was slightly violent, which brings me to the first rape scene. This was the one my friend had seen. It was disturbing mainly because I am deeply against ANY sort of violence against women let alone something like this. It was justified (I believe) in the context of the movie and was interesting because the guy raping the main character actually says ""I'm sorry"" and he does actually mean it because *SPOLIER* filming the scene for a movie. Having watched the film in its entirety and now reflecting, it can also be seen as a trigger point for the events which then unfold. One of the main characters managers is watching the scene unfold on one of the preview screens and you can tell that she feels the main characters pain. So much so that you could almost believe that she is feeling the pain herselfI can't say anymore without ruining the movie completely as once you know the twist the movie is not worth watching, another M. Night Shyamalan trait. There is a second rape scene in the movie, towards the end, though not as justified as the first. This one is slightly more disturbing as there is no audience this time. While upon reflection this scene seems important for the conclusion of the film I cannot pinpoint the exact reason. Possibly it highlights the mental confusion in the film at its climax? I would love it if someone who has watched this film could maybe clarify the reason for this scene or even just throw up a suggestion. Despite the two scenes I have described in detail I did actually enjoy the film and would recommend it. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you enjoy anime and enjoy physiological thrillers then you may enjoy it.",Perfect Blue

202,mya-00814,A must-watch anime movie,9,13 October 2018,"The horror genre is known to be full of cheesy jump scares or poorly written plots. Notable movies that were well received by critics and the public, like The Shining or A Nightmare On Elm Street, came out over a decade ago. There has been a resurgence of good ones lately with, A Quiet Place and Get Out, but history shows how hard it is to make good horror films. In Satoshi Kun's movie, Perfect Blue, the story engrosses the watcher in the life of a pop-idol, Mima, and her career shift into acting. Idols are fantasy relationships the performer has with the audience, making them feel like they know the performer as their own best friend. Mima experiences this kind of duality as a singer and a regular person. Over the course of the movie, she grows more and more unsure about what her identity is: a singer or an actor. Mima starts to slowly descend into a path of madness, making even the watcher confused about what is truly reality. She starts to suspect herself as the murderer of people around her, obsesses over blog posts that detail her life but were not written by her, and feels as if she is pushing her acting career too far. All these events break Mima. At the end of the film, the viewer can confidently say that Mima has gone somewhat crazy, but it is not known if Mima has conquered these mental trials. If the audience knew one-hundred percent of the time what was happening in the horror movie ""Perfect Blue,"" the movie's quality would fall flat. But because of the confusing surrealism, it elevates and heightens the movie's tension and conflict with Mima's identity.
 To make reality more muddled for Mima, Satoshi Kun uses different forms of media to show two different realities, showing the uncertainty of Mima's life. In the beginning of the film, Mima is barely able to use the internet and has to be taught by Rumi, her manager, to put in a URL. Mima puts in a URL to a website sent by a fan because she was curious why it was called Mima's Blog. The blog closely follows Mima's life as if she was still a singer and has very specific details only Mima could know about. Mima is seen throughout the movie going back repeatedly to the blog and exploring this alternate reality she could have been living as a singer. Mima describes herself in the blog posts as another person saying things like, ""so, what did YOU do today?"" As she continues to read blog posts during the movie, we can see her late at night more obsessively browsing away. This obsession over Mima's blog enforces the theme that Mima lives a dual life, making her doubt her identity as she consumes more and more blog posts. In addition to the internet, Mima's acting career intrudes her mental stability. In general, it is understandable how people can get so addicted to watching a television series that is not real. For Mima, acting in her show starts to cross the line of reality. For one, the script of the show eerily mirrors the events taking place around Mima and also has completely over-the-top scenes. The script involves a mentally ill woman who believes that someone is committing murders to the people close to her, and she gets raped while in a club. Mima's acting parallels to her lost sense of reality when she recites her script dialogue like, ""who am I"" in the show, when she mixes up her own name and her character's name while rehearsing, and the fact that Rumi ends up murdering the writers of the show because of the controversial script Mima was traumatized by. Mima thinks she did the murder because she found bloody clothes planted in her closet, and the audience sees an earlier scene of Mima stabbing one of the writers writer to death, but she does not remember anything about it. The rape scene also adds onto the craziness Mima is experiencing because she actually starts to believe she is being raped. What was supposed to be acting ended up becoming reality for Mima. In addition to all of these events, the viewer can see Mima's fans watch as she transitions from an innocent idol to an adult actress. We see them watching Mima in interviews and looking at articles about Mima posing naked for a photographer, supporting the fact that Mima has developed a new celebrity persona. But as the viewer, we know that Mima's new celebrity status came at a cost of her mental health. All of these portrayals of the entertainment industry and the internet help create two realities Mima is stuck in between. 
 Along with different forms of media, Satoshi Kun takes advantage of film techniques to further emphasize the meltdown of the reality in the movie. The color grade, which is the feeling the overall color in a scene portrays, becomes more and more extreme throughout the movie. The color of the movie is realistic to what you would see in real life. As the movie progresses, the color shifts more and more towards a red hue and becomes very saturated. This can symbolize the advancement of the madness that is taking place in the movie, further supporting the broken reality. The cuts between many scenes are also stitched together to end up with a seamless transition to a different setting. For example, Mima can be seen screaming during a traumatic moment in the movie with a close up of her face. The camera is then zoomed out to show that she was only acting a scene out. This and other scenes further blur the lines to what is actually happening and what is fiction. The soundtrack in this movie is also a great strength because it is totally bizarre. A couple catchy pop songs played in the beginning when Mima was an idol quickly transform into static noises combined with other odd noises like machinery, girls humming, sounds of someone walking, techno music, howling winds, and even more. The music's structure help set the tone of every scene, adding onto the creepiness or tension Mima and you are experiencing.
 Concluding with these ideas, Satoshi Kun is able to make a great horror movie without the usual cliché jump scare. The surrealism of the movie extends the already challenging problem conflicting Mima. It is important to take note of good movies that take risks. Perfect Blue was originally going to be filmed in real life, but the animation was great and arguably even better than most live-actions. It had controversial scenes, but a strong plot that demonstrates an overall theme of the movie, which we can still relate to twenty years later. Every time I watch Perfect Blue, I feel like I am riding a roller coaster. Movies these days are more aimed to make money or serve trends that are happening, like all the super hero movies nowdays. But, it is important for audience watchers to realize that the movies they are watching should all be as thought-provoking or used to its full potential as they should be because what is the point of watching movies with no meaningful story to them.",Perfect Blue
