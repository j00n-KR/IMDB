0,SnoopyStyle,great indie that launched Soderbergh,8,8 August 2014,Ann Bishop-Mullany (Andie MacDowell) is a sexually repressed neurotic in therapy. Her husband John (Peter Gallagher) is having an affair with her sister Cynthia Patrice Bishop (Laura San Giacomo). His old friend Graham Dalton (James Spader) comes by for a visit. Graham likes to videotape his interviews of women talking about sex. He videotapes Cynthia leading to everyone re-examining their relationships.Director Steven Soderbergh delivers a talkative slow boil that bubbles up emotional chaos. The frank verbal sexuality is quite a jolt. James Spader brings his usual slightly creepy character. The four differing personalities energizes this movie. Soderbergh lingers which gives the movie a great voyeuristic feel at times. The film is mesmerizing and is never dull.,"Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
1,gavin6942,A James Spader Mullet and a Great Movie,8,16 April 2007,"A couple is having difficulty in their marriage. No wonder, since she is not sexually attracted to him and he is sleeping with her sister. Then we enter his old college friend, who is no longer anything like him and has developed a weird fetish for filming women. Sometimes people break down.I have heard this is the film that made Soderbergh's career and also pushed James Spader, Peter Gallagher and Andie MacDowell. I can see why. MacDowell has a very reserved character here, yet her range is quite good. Gallagher plays a jerk, and his eyebrows are half the size they are in ""While You Were Sleeping"" (I guess they grow when you get famous). Spader, who excels in such films as ""Stargate"" and ""The Secretary"", is at home here -- the nerdy, yet somehow attractive introvert and minimalist. He is in the late 1980s and early 1990s what Adam Brody is for us today (2007).While much of the plot revolves around the affair, that is not really very interesting. A man cheating on his wife isn't really strange and even a man sleeping with his wife' sister isn't unheard of (though a bit gross in my mind). Spader's character shakes things up... the ""videotape"" third of the title is where the movie stands out from other such films. Confessions, secrets and intimacy over a home video system... no other film does this. And maybe you'd say ""why would they?"" but when you seem how raw the emotion is when done by home video, you'll see what the big screen cannot offer.I can't pinpoint what sold this film for me. I just became very engrossed in it, with its character-driven plot (and with such great actors, there's no need to worry if a character-driven plot will work. It will). Some parts are predictable (you know in the first few minutes the marriage is falling apart), but much of the film is anyone's guess: who will get punished, will new love spring up? It's a very beautiful expose of the human drama and of human emotional versatility.I recommend this film to you. Check it out... probably not when the kids are around (although the language and nudity are surprisingly tame for a film with this subject matter). It's probably not what you expect it to be...","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
2,lee_eisenberg,personal vs. physical garbage,9,8 April 2006,"The opening scene in ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" has Ann Mullany (Andie MacDowell) talking with her therapist about all the garbage that humans produce. Where are we going to put it all, she asks. One might say that the irony of her talking about garbage is that she never looks at the garbage in her personal life. Married to a philandering executive (Peter Gallagher) - who's having an affair with her sister (Laura San Giacomo), no less - Ann lives a sexually repressed existence, and spends her days cleaning her house, a clear sign of no fulfillment in her life. But that might all be about to change, now that she's met Graham Dalton (James Spader).Steven Soderbergh made a great directorial debut here, leading to the prolific career that he has now (including executive producing ""Syriana"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck""). The cast members all do a great job with the roles, and the script is laid out perfectly. A great movie.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
3,jboothmillard,"Sex, Lies, and Videotape",9,20 July 2010,"I decided to watch it because I had heard the title, I saw it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and then I found out it was the debut film from director Steven Soderbergh (Erin Brockovich, Ocean's Eleven). Basically Ann Bishop (Four Weddings and a Funeral's Golden Globe nominated Andie MacDowell) is married to John Mullany (While You Were Sleeping's Peter Gallagher), and he is having an affair with Ann's sister Cynthia Patrice Bishop (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Laura San Giacomo). Ann is the quiet type who is having therapy to express her concerns about things in the world, and even knowing her marriage is rocky she doesn't feel like she wants to have sex. When John's old college friend Graham Dalton (Secretary's James Spader) comes along, renting a flat, he makes friends with Ann, and Cynthia is very keen to meet him from Ann's description. Ann gets to know Graham more, and she finds his box of videotapes, and he confesses that they are all women being interviewed by him talking about sex, their experiences of it, and their fantasies. Ann is a bit freaked out by this, and she voices her concerns to Cynthia, but Cynthia still goes to see him, and finds out herself about the videotapes. She asks him to videotape her to talk about sex, and during this she also masturbates in front of him, which Ann is pretty shocked to her. When Ann finds an earring belonging to Cynthia while vacuuming, she confronts John about a possible affair, which he denies, but she knows he is lying. She goes to Graham for some comfort, and she decides to do a videotape herself, which he did advise not to based on the circumstances, but she does it anyway. John finds out about Graham filming his wife, and he does go over to punch him in the face, but then he watches Ann's videotape where she discusses her problems. There is also a point where she films him about why he likes to film women doing this, and after John leaves, Graham in anger breaks all his tapes. In the end, John is possibly fired from his job, Ann and Cynthia make up with each other, Ann as far as I know leaves John and goes with Graham. Also starring Ron Vawter as Therapist, Steven Brill as Barfly, Earl T. Taylor as Landlord and David Foil as John's Colleague. MacDowell is a good quiet and bored wife, Gallagher is a really good sneaky and manipulative husband, Giacomo is great as the sneaky and seductive sister, and Spader is really good as the quiet man with a very questionable hobby. From the title you would think it featured sex, but it doesn't need any, it is one of the great films that relies on the stars talking in detail about it, so in summation, it is a brilliant mainly dialogue carried drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
4,moonspinner55,"Plot is slim, but film is emotionally driven...",6,19 October 2006,"Intelligent, surprisingly enveloping movie is one that sneaked up on a lot of people in 1989, and has that effect on the unsuspecting today. A somewhat-frigid young woman becomes fascinated with her husband's friend, an emotionally confused man whose hobby is videotaping sexual conversations with women. The film takes about a quarter of an hour to kick in, yet once the character motivations become more clear it's quite an engrossing experience, a movie that unfolds rather like a novel. For those who stick with it, an intense drama peopled with some sordid characters who are nevertheless brilliantly portrayed by the cast. Andie MacDowell, as the wife who is so homespun she can't even swear, has rarely been so complex and affecting on film. **1/2 from ****","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
5,Quinoa1984,"a terrific, slowly unfolding debut with sublime performances",9,4 July 2004,"Steven Soderbergh, as observed by other reviewers and critics, did take inspiration from the kinds of films Eric Rohmer's been making for decades. These kinds of films, as Sex, Lies, and Videotape is at its core, about people in morality crises, and how they get out of them or linger with how they act is the point.  Some people may not like the film, therefore, as nothing incredibly outrageous or spectacular will occur.  For all the attention Soderbergh received (Golden Palm, Independent Spirits, Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, immediate recognition), he's made a small film, and it's not as ambitious as some of his later, greater works like Out of Sight and Traffic.  But as a revealing, intimate character study, with an often clever and controlled mis-en-scene, Soderbergh shows his skills were already honed at twenty-six.Without good acting the film would be like a hopeless rendition of a foreign film, but with the four lead performances from McDowell, Gallagher, Gia Como, and Spader (his is most under-stated of the bunch for me) these are as fully realized characters as Soderbergh could get.  They all must've taken something about the characters in the script, because for all the flaws and misconceptions and fears these characters carry, they are human.  Even Gallagher's John, who's the conniving husband and lawyer, is recognizably as he is even when he's comparatively lesser than Graham and Ann.  Only one side character, the barfly played by Steven Brill, gets the film to immediately halt with uncomfortable humor.  But the rest of the film, loaded with innuendo (there's not one shot of nudity, similar to a Rohmer film like Chloe in the Afternoon, where the cover art of the film is rather misleading to those looking for a film with breasts and other parts) and involving drama, doesn't shake its foundations until maybe the last five to ten minutes.  And when it does, it does not make the film a lost cause, at least for me.  Begs to be seen again, though with maybe a year or so between viewings.  A-","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
6,edwagreen,Eroticism and Frustration Just Don't Mix *,3,11 June 2012,"This film is not exactly Tennessee Williams's ""A Steetcar Named Desire."" Given, we have plenty of frustration, anxiety, eroticism and utter despair shown, but the film essentially becomes a moody piece of unhappiness, deceit and repressed sexual desires.The performances are good, especially those of Andie McDowall and Peter Gallagher as the apparently unhappy couple engaging in their sexual peccadillo's.As the sister engaged in an affair with her brother-in-law, Laura Saint Jacamo is appealing, but the material she has to work with leaves a lot to be desired.In the age of taping and other technological advances, we need to know why these people engage in the behavior they do. We come away with a totally unsatisfying feeling after viewing the film.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
7,michaelRokeefe,A story of lust and sexual awakening.,7,26 April 2000,"John Melaney (Peter Gallagher) is a businessman not content with his frigid wife, Ann (Andie MacDowell). Melaney is having an affair with his wife's sister, played by Laura San Giacomo. A friend of Melaney, played by James Spader, returns to town.

8,sunwarrior13,Too Bad I Saw It 27 Years Too Late,9,27 October 2016,"Sex,Lies, And Videotape is the first movie of Steven Sodenberg that led him to prominence in Hollywood.This independent drama about a couple tells us a story on how lack of sex drive or interest in sex becomes a focal point in the marriage between the husband and wife which involved the husband's friend together with his camera and the wife's sister.It stars James Spader,Andie MacDowell,Peter Gallagher and Laura San Giacomo.Ann Bishop Mullany is no longer interested in sex.She feels that throwing a garbage is even more interesting.Waste Disposal arouses her more than having sex that is why she never have had any orgasm.This leads to a lot of unhappiness into their marriage particularly John,who is still very much interested in sex.That is why he starts an affair with her wife's sister,Cynthia.As the story progresses,John's old college friend Graham whom he hasn't seen for nine years comes into the picture.He gets introduced to Ann and Cynthia.Later,he is found having a camera and lots of videos of women talking about sex.Ann gets to visit him and finds him watching a recording of a certain woman named Elizabeth and she tells Cynthia about it.This leads Cynthia into talking to Graham and starts doing a recording for Graham.This leads to a story when we see John's work get affected by constantly sleeping with Cynthia,Ann and Cynthia getting angry with each other after the former discovers the affair,John getting mad with Graham after learning of the certain closeness developing between his wife and college friend,Ann and Cynthia reconciling after the former files a divorce from John, and unexpectedly Graham and Ann becoming a couple.I have always heard of this movie but it was only recently when I got hold of the video to be able to finally watch it.It was a good movie.No question about it.The characters in the story were interesting. Sex becoming the focal point of the story without resorting to pornography was done well by Sodenberg.Acting was definitely great especially Laura San Giacomo who was basically a newcomer back then when the movie was shown.The only thing that prevented me from giving it a perfect 10/10 rating is the fact that I have seen it 27 years too late.Too bad that this somehow kickstarted better movies about sex for many years to come and the story at present is no longer something to be considered as independent which was considered back then when it was released in 1989.Or worse,others would have seen this a dated film by today's standard.I alone would have considered it as one if I never took its year of release as a consideration especially after I have seen many Hollywood movies and foreign movies that have more daring stories about sex. I would have better appreciation of this film if I saw it back then.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
9,lastliberal,Being happy isn't all that great. I mean... the last time I was... really happy... I got really fat.,7,21 June 2009,"Oscar nominations (Soderbergh), BAFTA nominations (Soderbergh, Laura San Giacomo), Golden Globe nominations (Andie MacDowell, San Giacomo, Soderbergh) , César nominations (Soderbergh), and Cannes awards (James Spader, Soderbergh) for just about everyone in this film except Peter Gallagher.Steven Soderbergh (Traffic, Erin Brockovich) wrote and directed this film, his first feature-length effort.It's hard to determine who played the better part, Andie MacDowell or Laura San Giacomo. I happen to be prejudiced towards one over the other, so I have a hard time making a pick. They were both fabulous. The repartee between them was hilarious as one was having an affair with the other's husband.The way that MacDowell turned the session with Spader around was fascinating. The sex became secondary to the conversation and was the best part of the film.Outstanding acting by Spader and MacDowell.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
10,evanston_dad,Early Soderbergh Movie Anticipated the Indie Boom of the 90s,8,4 September 2008,"Steven Soderbergh has turned into one of the most schizophrenic directors alive, able to follow up gritty films like ""Traffic"" with glossy and frivolous Hollywood fare like the ""Ocean's Eleven"" series.""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" is one of his early efforts before anyone really knew who he was, and it's an excellent character study with erotic thriller overtones. It features second-tier stars giving great performances, and it's got that indie vibe that began to take hold late in the 1980s and would evolve into the full-fledged indie movement of the 90s.Grade: A","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
11,HotToastyRag,A staple in indie films,6,25 July 2019,"""The last time I was happy, I got so fat.""If you chuckle during Andie MacDowell's famous line in Sex, Lies and Videotape, you'll probably think of her sister, Laura San Giacomo as the lead. If you laugh yourself silly, knowing Andie's confession is also true for you, you'll probably think of her as the lead. My weight has always been a direct correlation of my happiness, so that line been added to my household phrases!If you've never seen it, you'll have to put on your 1989 goggles before renting Steven Soderbergh's breakthrough indie movie. By today's standards, this movie is tame. In 1989, it was shocking and actually considered quite nasty. It was a time before the internet, before photos and videos were constantly taken and spread around, and a time when movies didn't always show nudity and graphic sex scenes. By today's standards, it's not really an oddity if a young man prefers to film and watch sexual encounters rather than to participate in them, but in 1989, James Spader's character was very unusual. Just like most photographers or videographers, he uses the lens to distance himself from situations. He asks people questions about their sexual experiences, and when the women answer him honesty, it's supposed to be very daring. It was daring in 1989!The other part of the plot is a love triangle involving the dreamy Peter Gallagher. He's married to Andie, but having an affair with her sister, Laura. I've played Laura's part in two separate college reproductions, so I've studied the script probably far more than the average viewer. There's quite a bit to analyze in Soderbergh's script, which film students have been discussing for thirty years. It's a bit of a love-it-or-hate-it movie, so if you watch it and shrug, don't feel like you're missing something. There are plenty of people who think it's overrated and weird, just as there are plenty of people who think it's a staple in indie movies.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
12,AaronCapenBanner,Provocative Talk,8,9 December 2013,"Steven Soderbergh directed this provocative drama that stars James Spader as Graham Dalton, who comes back into the life of his college friend John(played by Peter Gallagher) who is a serial philander, despite having a beautiful wife named Ann(played by Andie MacDowell) who befriends Graham, and to her surprise, finds herself consenting to be interviewed by him for his personal project. Also agreeing to this is Ann's sister Cynthia, who is quite unlike her, and having an affair with John, which will cause things to come to a head with the four of them... Intriguing film is most original, dependent entirely on conversation and suggestion, which proves remarkably effective. Some character decisions don't seem to make sense, yet the film is realistic.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
13,christopher-underwood,captivating and engaging throughout,9,23 August 2017,"An intelligent and very well crafted movie that moves along, seemingly effortlessly. The main characters struggle to understand themselves and those around them and we similarly are drawn into the webs that are woven and torn apart. A fine achievement from Steven Soderbergh who must wonder if he will ever match the quality again. He is helped enormously with monumental performances particularly from James Spader and Andie MacDowel, although as I don't think I have seen either perform quite this well, their performances are likely down to dedicated work from the director. Laura San Giacomo also does a wicked turn and the naughty sister and helps to keep the film interesting in the early scenes when MacDowell's character seems set to sink the whole enterprise, or is that her psychiatrist? Perceptive, touching, intimate and revealing, this involving film is captivating and engaging throughout.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

15,namashi_1,An Absorbing Film...,7,6 October 2011,"'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is an absorbing film, that is superbly written & directed by Academy-Award-Winner Steven Soderbergh. The Seasoned Storyteller makes a film, that ever since it's release, has sustained a massive fan-base, due to it's neat execution. Also, the performances by all the actors aboard, are terrific.'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' Synopsis: An old college friend re-enters the lives of a married couple and causes them to re-examine their relationship. Steven Soderbergh's Writing & Direction, both, are gritty, uneasy & yet neat. The filmmakers delivers an absorbing film, that holds your attention at most times. However, Let me inform you, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is not meant for everyone. It's meant for those, that have an appetite of watching strong-drama on celluloid. Cinematography by Walt Lloyd, deserves a special mention.Performance-Wise: Andie MacDowell is terrific. James Spader has never been so good. The Actor delivers an unforgettable performance in here. Laura San Giacomo is first-rate. Peter Gallagher does very well, as well. On the whole, 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape' is a film to watch. Thumbs Up!","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
16,thesar-2,"Good first outing, Steven.",7,18 August 2019,"30th Anniversary: 1989 - the Best Year in Cinema Marathon Film #56/100: ""sex, lies and videotape"" (2nd Viewing.) Probably my favorite director, or really close to the top. And yet, with only my 2nd viewing in exactly 30 years, I thought (both times) this was good, but eh. Never need to see it again after this 3-decade revisit. Definitely taboo at the time - which was why this 15-year-old went to go see it in the first place. Wait, who let a 15-yo into this Hard R film?","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
17,ElMaruecan82,Tell me about Sex... and I tell you who you are...,9,10 January 2018,"""sex, lies and videotape"" is exactly about what it says, but frankly, the film could have been titled ""all about sex"" since the lies are all about sex, and don't get me started on the content of these videotapes. Steven Soderbergh Golden Palm winner, and game changer on the field of independent film-making, is certainly one of the most intelligent and insightful depiction of sex as a 'relationship issue' as any other movie, that it does so without being graphic at all is a credit to its maturity and straight-forwardness.And ""Sex is overrated"" is one of the many golden nuggets the Oscar-nominated script contains, even more fascinating since the line is echoed by an admittance of impotence, a weakness seldom confessed by men, but which creates the strangest though slightly anticipated bond between Graham (James Spader) and Ann (Andie McDowell). She's an introverted and complex woman, he's an old college friend of her husband John (Peter Gallagher), who just came to town. At first, Ann is angry and shares her bitterness with her therapist, expecting to be the passive observer of boring dinners where the two reminisce about girl and football.But while John is your typical cocky and womanizing lawyer with suspenders in his shirt and tricks under his sleeve, Graham has no job, no house, he's a long-haired young looking man, oddly detached from the casual responsibilities but weirdly interested in people. Graham asks the most private questions to Ann at their very first encounter. She detects his awkwardness but we suspect she's glad that he's not like John. They talk about marriage and she says she enjoys the security of it, for all his defaults, John is a good provider, but there's something shy and self-conscious in the way she says it that reminded me of Liv Ullman's in ""Scenes of a Marriage"".In Bergman's masterpiece, I never forgot that line about marriage only working if ""fidelity went without saying"", as if the colossal edifice had to be rooted on blind obviousness. But every film that involved dysfunctional couples proved that no matter how supposedly strong they were, marriages failed because of things taken for granted, things that went without saying. And the first signal that the relationship between Ann is John isn't just that John is having an affair with Ann's own sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) but that even Ann instantly opens herself to Graham.Remember that exchange between Homer Simpson and the new neighbor, Ruth Powers, when he's tiptoeing around to ask a private question, and she eases the task by saying that she would like to be fixed up with someone, because she has ""normal appetites"". Homer gets the message but still makes sure she's not talking about food... twice. Sex isn't the easiest subject to handle but once it's done, it becomes the key to open the Pandora box of a marriage,. But the film doesn't explore the theme of infidelity rather than the way 'sex' is used to as a mean to convey or conceal the sources of your own insecurities, it doesn't reduce people to sexual attitudes as much as it expands the value of sex as an existential catalysis.Ann is an over-anxious person whose mind is obsessed by situations she can't have the control on, she's full of empathy and therefore can't express any desire unless it's directed toward someone else, she's not frigid but she's not attracted enough to John to satisfy him. John and Cynthia are more 'common' lovers, John is lawyer, a running gag informs that it's the first lowest form before liars, he screws people and dominates his wife by having sex with another woman, it's part of his persona. So is Cynthia whose ego is flattered as if she was finally getting the satisfaction of indirectly owning her sister, like the family slut winning over the goody-goody sister.Still, this is not a film that invites us to condemn people, it only tells the magnitude of sexuality as what is says about our inners struggles, our desires, our weaknesses, things that warm, block or drive us. And the most fascinating character in this quartet is Graham. At first, he says he's impotent but by saying he can't have sex, he's allowed to record sexual confessions of women on videotapes which gives him considerably more power, status-wise. Ann manages to confront him in a scene that is a masterpiece of writing, pushing Graham in the corner of his odd fantasies and unable to answer for his lust... and admit that there's something indeed pathetic about him, but not to the point of not needing help. He might be his first 'victim'.Steven Soderbergh's writing is one of great subtlety and realism, it only sins in the portrayal of the husband John, he strikes as a two-dimensional character compared to the three others, and the way he gets his comeuppance doesn't do justice to the originality of the movie, there's one 'detail' you could see coming and it didn't quite work but apart from small little flaws, this is a remarkable portrayal of adults caught in tormenting relationships and trying to find their way to slip through the net. It is also served by fine performances especially from James Spader who won the Prize at Cannes Festival, and Laura San Giacomo. This film should have had the same resonance as Mike Nichols' ""Closer"" in 2004 with two acting nods for Spader and San Giacomo, they're the best thing about the film.
Now, I'm not the fondest on remakes but I suspect the content of the script is so relevant and universal it would fit the digital era as well, I can imagine a ""sex, lies and Internet"" tailor-made for the 2010's, where lovers, chatters, deceived husbands would drown their sorrow by sharing their insecurities to the first listening 'ear'.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
18,paul2001sw-1,Whatever turns you on,6,24 February 2004,"Soderbergh's much praised debut, 'Sex, Lies and Videotape', is a wry, low-key, self-consciously knowing but somewhat stilted account of the sexual lives, and problems, of a group of four closely connected southern Americans.  Having seen it twice, once on release and once recently, all I can say is that this particular piece of videotape does nothing much for me, as it tells a believable but uninteresting story.  Fun for the big hair, otherwise a well-crafted but faintly pointless movie.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
19,inkblot11,"Very intriguing film, even now, when the word ""tape"" is passe",9,6 April 2009,"Ann (Andie MacDowell) is a beautiful Louisiana woman with a seemingly perfect existence. She is married to a good-looking, up-and-coming lawyer, John (Peter Gallagher), lives in a gorgeous, large house, wears lovely clothes and does not work outside the home. Nevertheless, she has been seeing a shrink, for a pervasive unhappiness. Lately, too, she has begun to suspect that her husband is unfaithful, for he has not been making any advances to Ann. Causing her some grief, also, is her unmarried younger sister, Cindy (Laura San Giacomo), who is somewhat of a nymphomaniac and is pretty catty about relating her experiences to her sister. Now, there is a new problem. Her husband has invited an old college buddy, Graham (James Spader) to spend a few days with them, as he is attempting to relocate to the area. As it happens, it turns out Graham is no trouble at all, but a handsome, seemingly kind man who really listens to Ann when she is speaking. But, after helping Graham find an appropriate apartment, Ann becomes uncomfortable when Graham asks her a few questions about her marriage and sex life. This is compounded even more when Ann tells Cindy about Graham and Cindy trots off to meet the new man in town, with considerable haste. Later, Cindy tells her sis that Graham has some highly unusual habits and possesses a collection of homemade videotapes, which consist of various women ""telling all"" about their sex lives to the camera. Wowwee! Yet, out of this quartet of players, who will end up happy in love? This is a highly intriguing film, with a quirky style and plot in addition to great performances. All four principal actors grab the viewers attention mightily and give enigmatic turns that baffle and surprise. As for the storyline, it is a far-from-the-ordinary mystery about the double lives of ordinary folk, where surface evaluation gives one answer and a closer look brings another. The Louisana setting near Baton Rouge is very lovely while the costumes are also quite nice. Add on a tantalizing direction and unique style by Soderberg and you have a winning film that, nonetheless, may not appeal to all film goers, due to the sensitive subject matter. However, if you like your movies offbeat, fresh, and bold, get this one very, very soon.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
20,johnnyboyz,"The film delivers what it says in its title but gives so much more in terms camera work, acting and subject matter.",8,31 October 2007,"This is the film, for me, that cements my opinion on Steven Soderbergh. I saw where he was coming from when he made Traffic, even if it wasn't that great to me and really enjoyed Ocean's Eleven not for what the story was but for the way it was told. Here, Soderbergh has made a film and a debut film it must be said that shows he not only understands film but also how to unwind a story, give us characters who are believable and how to present the action on screen through the compositions; that is that he knows how to use the camera.Sex, Lies, and Videotape is an example of how to utilise a basic domestic problem with a relationship in a film but give it a voyeuristic twist, artistic camera-work and how to manipulated time and space. There are people who study voyeurism in film like it's a religion and camcorders in a film is a sure fire way to get those sorts of people excited but that's just the beginning of Sex, Lies, & Videotape. The film uses a straightforward problem as its drive for the narrative; that problem is a married man having an affair. What follows is a reunion with a friend called Graham Dalton (Spader) that the husband will really wish he hadn't set up as Dalton brings not only voyeurism but a threat to the exposure of the affair. Ann Mullany (MacDowell), whose husband John (Gallagher) is having the affair is presented as a shy and straightforward woman perhaps living an American Dream of her own: nice house, money, food on the table, etc. but despite these humane and friendly traits, she is in a position she doesn't know about  she may not like sex that much but John does and with people other than herself. This means these two people are sort of binary opposites to one another and yet they are joined by marriage  an accident waiting to happen so already; Sex, Lies, and Videotape is creating a pressure cooker of events and characters who look set to explode once the dirty gets out.I mentioned that I thought Soderbergh's camera-work was really impressive in this film and that is a true statement. So often camera-work can go unnoticed or without acclaim but the way it's utilised in the film oozes of class. Take the scene in which some characters are arguing at a dinner table; the argument ends with a long take showing us the climax of it. One character is in the kitchen and we see this thanks to a shot in the corner of the room where the ceiling meets the wall; almost from the stairs if there were any there. This is the sort of angle you'd get from a close circuit television (CCTV) camera or a surveillance camera you get in security rooms: we are watching the argument from on high, surveying the area as if we have a link with the world in which the film is being set; we are observant through the most voyeuristic shot possible: the security camera shot since when you're watching someone through one of those, you can see them but they can't see you.Another incident occurs when John is on the phone to the girl he's having an affair with and yet the camera is set up to just include a photograph of Ann who's staring at John the whole time he's on the phone organising an illegal get-together. Not only does this tell us that John's wrong doing seemingly leaves him with a clear conscience as he talks to his mistress but also gives us enough information to have us form a very negative opinion of the character. Sex, Lies, and Videotape is also very good at combining genres since its brief pauses for scenes with the therapist and the barfly character act as pit stops away from the home and away from the lust and distrust. Not only this but they act as a good reason for humour and for Ann to tell us as well as the therapist what's she's thinking. We may ask the questions the therapist asks; we (the males, at least) may also have tried what the barfly tries and offer her some relief even though the barfly has no idea what she's been through  we do. This is why the barfly isn't put across as a complete lout: just a friendly looking and soft spoken person looking for companionship which is at a far-fetched level, exactly what Ann is. Sex, Lies, and Videotape is a fantastic film to look into and a film that will live on for its content especially its acting; Spader in particular who comes across as a nervous, perhaps too confident guy who has his own personal ways of turning himself on involving woman and cameras but the film is great for its subject matter, the way it handles its subject matter and the way it presents its subject matter.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
21,leplatypus,"Except this, you got nothing else! (DVD)",1,24 June 2009,"This is the worst movie I have seen this year.The story can be written on a stamp. Maybe talking about sex was a discovery for the American people but in France, we got tons of empty movies like this, so we are immunized! There aren't any locations: all happens in bedrooms, kitchen or living-room. The cast is awful between the husband, the sister and the ""angelic"" director. Poor Andie is terribly alone. Music is silence and if you think the director (the real one) played with the editing, mixing between tapes and reels, you are wrong! It's incomprehensible how this movie can be awarded by the ""Palme d'or"" at Cannes festival but it is his unique merit!","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
22,jzappa,Language. The Most Titillating Erogenous Zone.,8,28 October 2011,"The contention in this refreshingly modest, human film is that talk is superior to sex, more personal, more sensuous, and that with our wits we can do things to one another that make sex, that transaction of fluid and self-consciousness, feel simply problematic. Sure enough, this line of reasoning is all a psychological short-game itself. The film is set in Baton Rouge, LA, where it spins a psychological yarn of four thirtysomethings whose sex lives are gravely muddied. One is an attorney named John, married to Ann but no longer sleeps with her. Early on, we hear her telling her psychiatrist that this is no big deal. Sex is just hyped, she finds, weighed against larger matters like how the world is running out of places to put its trash. On the other hand, her husband doesn't find sex so overrated and, naturally, is having a hot-blooded affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia, who has always begrudged her sanctimonious sibling.An old buddy arrives in town. His name is Graham, and he was John's college roommate. Nobody seems entirely sure what he's been doing since, but he's one of those sorts about whom you don't ask questions like that, as you get the sense most normal people don't want to know. He's risky, not in a brute manner. On the contrary, through his sly astuteness, which appears to get to the bottom of people. He passes through. One day he has lunch with Ann, and they start to toy with their chatting, getting one another going with words gently selected to inhabit the precarious ground between aphrodisia and an offer. She says she doesn't rate sex highly, but then he tells her something that gets her attention: He admits that he's impotent. It is, probably, a basic truth of the human self-image in the sexually active days that most women think they can cure a man's impotence, as most men think they're the miracle worker for a woman's frigidity.The early scenes of this extraordinarily tasteful and modern piece of understatement are a relaxed, but captivating, setup for the disorder that ensues. The betrayal by John and Cynthia has its natural cost, but the movie and we the audience are more keen on Graham's sexual activities. Incapable of pleasing himself in the customary manner, he records the sexual fantasies of women, and then watches them. This is a style of molestation. He has command not over their bodies but over their psyches, over the skeletons in their cupboards, and I suppose the most titillating sentence in his lexicon is ""She's actually telling me this stuff!"" Ann is revolted by Graham's leisure pursuitand spellbound, and soon, the two of them are before his camera, in a scene of extraordinary delicacy and impact, both realizing that, for them, sex is just the introduction to their secrets. In fact, Spader's performance throughout the movie is a sort of thrill-seeking. Can you conceive of the test an actor confronts in making the character of Graham and making him not just interesting but give him a come-hither allure? Spader has that hue of sexual indistinctness that hints that if he sidesteps the common sexual tactics it's because he has something more exciting in mind.The account of sex, lies and videotape is part of a bygone 1990s indie filmmaking mythology, how 29-year-old writer-director Steven Soderbergh hammered out the script on a week's trip to LA, how the film was made for roughly one million, how it won the Palme d'Or. There are flashes when it reminds us of how sexy the movies could be, and once were, back in the Double Indemnity days, when language was like a foot massage.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
23,mjneu59,frustration and infidelity,7,1 January 2011,"Steven Soderbergh's acclaimed debut feature is actually less kinky than a quick synopsis would suggest: an impotent drifter (James Spader) with an undefined source of income and a curious hobby (videotaping the sexual confessions of women) befriends the inhibited wife of an old college pal, who meanwhile is enjoying a torrid affair with his own sister-in-law. The subtle interplay of tensions and emotions between each character must have seemed more than usually absorbing to moviegoers in the late 1980s conditioned by a decade of low-IQ blockbusters. It certainly helped jump-start (in a big way) the career of its writer-director, who in his first film bucked current trends by favoring substance over style, serving his cast with some witty banter and giving them plenty of elbow room in which to work.Soderbergh revealed a gift for writing natural dialogue, and for coaching unforced performances from his actors (love those pregnant pauses). But the story might have made more sense if he didn't identify so obviously with his enigmatic anti-hero: the lone artist who drifts into town and promptly changes everyone's life (including his own). And the resolution is unforgivably neat: a suddenly (and illogically) galvanized Andie MacDowell forces Spader to unburden his own hang-ups on camera, after which the two of them settle down to live happily ever after while her two-timing yuppie scum husband loses both his girlfriend and, presumably, his high-salary job.The film as a result presents a curious morality tale with no clear moral, but Soderburgh was clearly a talent to watch. And the director showed enough intuition to recognize video technology as not only an emblem of emotional detachment in an age of dysfunctional communication, but also as an instrument of hard truth.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
24,triple8,"A movie that shows you don't need lush sets, big budgets, or loud background music to be extraordinary.",9,10 April 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Sex Lies and Videotape relies on the bare minimum of movie ""accessories"". There are no elaborate sets, constant background music or explosions, exotic locations etc. What this movie does is make you listen. It relies entirely on the Performers to hook you in. There isn't any background stuff going on, just the sound of the performers' voices. It shows one, how truly incredibly GOOD a movie can be when it pays attention to the dialog.I'm not one to outline the whole plot, as many reviewers have already done that and many reading this already know what it's about. What I want to do is comment on the humanness of the film. To me, a movie becomes truly superb when it almost ceases to become a movie and you feel like your watching a story enfolding right in front of you. This film's focus is on four people, all seriously troubled when it comes to both sex and love and relationships. It is mostly a character study and entirely dialog driven. The movie is at the mercy of it's talent and I say that because if people with lesser talents had been chosen for these roles, I doubt the quality would still be here. It is, in that regard, similar to one of my favorite films of 2004, a movie by the name of Closer. That movie, too, dealt with the above mentioned issues and though the plot was different the performers needed to be the best they could be, to make the film a success.Sex lies and Videotape is a movie where one does not want it to end. It's also a movie where, the ultimate outcome is less important, then finding out who these people are and what makes them tick. They are interesting and the reason they are, is because they are real people. And like real people, they have issues. They aren't perfect feel good imaginary characters, their flawed, fearful and real. And much more interesting then many of the Stepford characters so prevalent in movies.The performances were all flawless, particularly Spader who managed to make his character troubled, all knowing, haunted and(in spite of his hobby) PURE-not an easy thing to do. An Oscar worthy performance. I happen to think this is not just good, but outstanding. It gets 9 of 10 from me and is a movie I'd strongly recommend. Although it's called Sex, LIES and Videotape, it doesn't get much more honest then this movie. A definite must see.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
25,Galina_movie_fan,Fascinating Debut,9,3 August 2007,"Steven Soderbergh's now legendary debut was the first his film I saw. It was in 1989, during the Moscow International Film Festival. Only later I found out that Sodebergh was 29 when he wrote the screenplay in eight days during a trip to Los Angeles and made the film for $1.8 million. His independent movie was a real hit that was selected for Cannes Film Festival and won the Palme d'Or and the best actor prize for James Spader.The film concerns four attractive and intelligent young people. Ann (Andy MacDowell in the best role I've ever seen her) is married to John (Gallagher) but their sexual life is practically non-existent since Ann finds sex over-rated, and to simply put it, she does not enjoy or even need it. John is having an affair with Ann's sexy younger sister, Cynthia (San Giacomo) who seems to resent Ann. Enters Graham (Spader), John's college friend with the unusual hobby of videotaping women while they describe their sexual fantasies and very important skill - he knows how to listen.I had seen many movies before ""sex, lies and videotape"" and I've seen plenty since but it has a special place in my memory. It was the first film I had seen that dealt with and talked about very intimate topics of sexuality, satisfaction, jealousy, sisters' relationship, marital problems and loyalty, the secret longings in all of us, and the ever mysterious nature of erotic desire with such level of honesty, openness, and intelligence. The writing, the dialogs, and the acting are superb with James Spader and Laura San Giacomo simply outstanding and Andie McDowell very convincing.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
26,PredragReviews,"""Did anybody touch anybody""",8,13 June 2016,"A strange, but very rewarding movie. Soderbergh has went on to create many wonderful films since ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" but what has captured my attention about this film is his how he kept the film simple and concentrated on the details around the four characters. He mentions in the commentary of his influence of Eric Rohmer (who created the popular films as part of his ""Six Moral Tales"") and the long dialogue between characters. Maybe it made no impression to me back then but now, any director who can have their characters engage in dialogue with meaning and profoundness is wonderful.Andie MacDowell was the surprising star because in the beginning, I thought she would be the typical jilted housewife but we see her character emerge as one that is confused to one that finally gains perspective. Laura San Giacomo did well in portraying the free-will Cynthia (which she would go on to do again in ""Pretty Woman""), John Mullany (Peter Gallagher) was the ultimate sleezeball and for Graham (Spader), his character was mysterious and although the viewer doesn't know exactly what had happen to him, it's how the character was changed after changing the character he videotaped. As the film itself, one can see how this independent film helped revolutionize indie films and allowing media coverage. Sure, we see independent films, art-house films receive media coverage today but in the context of independent films getting seen by a wide audience, ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape"" was definitely instrumental in being part of that small group of films that Hollywood would give a chance to.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
27,pc95,Outstanding acting and dialogue; good support music,8,25 July 2006,"One of the better character driven movies out there, Sex Lies and Videotape is captivating and edgy. The dialogue is witty, sarcastic, and at times biting. It deals with the topics of fidelity and sex in a grown-up way delving into decisions, actions, and latent consequences. Especially effective was the last 20 min or so after where Ann finally comes upon the evidence. All 4 primary cast members are dynamic and complementary - they all were great in their roles. I especially enjoyed the final interview and moody music to go along with it. There was a feeling of sympathy for both characters. Sex becomes a center of discussion and thoughtfulness rather than an act or only sensuality - it is not merely for show and entertainment. There's a great dichotomy at play throughout the movie that has the 2 cheaters involved in the act while the other 2 are trying to contemplate through things. And thus a realization at the end that sex in and of itself is fairly empty and ephemeral although explosive enough to detonate social lives if not nurtured properly. Outstanding and worth a purchase.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
28,mentalcritic,"Dated, and not necessarily in a good way",5,29 June 2005,"In 1989, the idea that computers would be publicly networked into a vast library of information from which any information on any subject can be found was over the horizon. Films like Sex, Lies, And Videotape were therefore considered shocking, even perverted. Today, in this age where one can read stories on subject matters discussed by the characters in this film (or even that which the film is based around) with the click of a button, the premise is utterly passé. That it could have attracted so much attention in the US market in 1989 reveals how America's citizenry was more tightly repressed than Ann. The cast is minuscule by most standards, and there really are only four stars to speak of. The fact that half of them are about as charismatic as a puddle does not help. That I remember Earl T. Taylor's performance more clearly than James Spader's or Andie MacDowell's is not the best of signs. I am starting to believe that Jennifer Jason Leigh is glad she missed the opportunity to appear here.I can handle films that consist of long conversations between several pairs of characters, and I can even handle films that consist of interview footage. What I cannot handle is a film partially comprised of interview footage that is so predictable and monotonous that one can guess what the character is going to say before the question is asked. It is not until about sixty-odd minutes into the film when Ann finds the evidence of Graham's affair with Cynthia that she has been challenged to produce that any spark of interest in the story is generated. By then, it is too late because most of the characters concerned are less than uncompelling. It is not the fault of the actors, as they seem perfectly competent. It is just that the characters they inhabit, the story they are telling, and the film's framing of both, have little to recommend them.The music by Cliff Martinez attempts to inject some sliver of tension into the proceedings, but it instead succeeds in being annoying. If it could be more stilted or obvious, I do not know how. Clearly, the hearts of the composer and director were in the right place, but the result is about as interesting as a wet sock. If the film is trying to make the point that conversation is more satisfying than sex, then it has missed the mark. The conversations are flat and pointless, and the characters are as deep as a compact disc. I have never enjoyed a performance by Andie MacDowell, Groundhog Day notwithstanding. Even in Hudson Hawk, she manages to suck all the life and fun out of her character. Peter Gallagher is about as likable as a stomach ulcer, and James Spader's charisma vortex was pretty much confirmed thirteen years later in Secretary.If the film does have a saving grace, it is the serpent-like performance from Laura San Giacomo. Her biography on the IMDb begins with ""Fans and critics love Laura, she always gives a great performance"", and this art-house production is no exception. She is beautiful enough to hook the men in the audience, unlike the woman playing her on-screen sister, and her performance is based around the knowledge of this fact. In every scene she plays, she steals the show. The fact that she cares enough about other people in her offscreen life, at least if the stories about her campaigning for ""inclusive educational opportunities for all children"" are to be believed, gives every character she portrays, including this one, a certain soul that those who occupy Sex, Lies, And Videotape with her lack. In essence, she is the heart of this film. No, let me rephrase that, she is the heart, brains, lungs, and many other things of a story whose cast of characters seem so utterly lacking it makes the attempts at pop psychology seem like they would be laughable if they were not so utterly sad.Out of ten, I gave Sex, Lies, And Videotape a five. Those five points are for Laura San Giacomo alone. Having seen this film twice on occasions about five to ten years apart, I can honestly say I never saw what all the fuss was about. Judging from the fact that the film was pretty much tossed onto DVD like a piece of trash onto a garbage heap, I am guessing that the film-making community has similar feelings.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
29,jaredmobarak,"Never take advice from someone you don't know intimately sex, lies, and videotape",8,12 December 2006,"Here we have the film that put frequent indie/mainstream crossover, powerhouse director Steven Soderbergh on the cinematic map. I wasn't quite sure what to expect having never seen it and hearing all the hype surrounding it. For some reason I thought there was an NC -17 controversy swirling around its release before finally being given an R rating and was a bit intrigued what could possibly have caused it. To my surprise there was no nudity whatsoever and besides the frequent swearing was much tamer than anticipated. What this film ended up being was an intelligent, witty character piece, driven completely by its dialogue. It isn't as much the actions of the characters on screen than how they express themselves verbally to each other, and how they look upon themselves. sex, lies, and videotape is a story about people finding out who they really are and seeing how their actions can effect the direction their lives will go. In order for the dialogue to really drive this story, the acting needed to be perfect, and for the most part it is. At first, Andie MacDowell's Anne seemed to be horribly acted, expressions with over-amplified and she just didn't seem natural. As the film continued on though, one discovers that that is the person Anne is. She is self-conscious and always weighing her words before she speaks. I believe she is aware of her own naiveté and therefore seems less intelligent than she is. By the end of the film MacDowell's was one of my favorite performances in it. Peter Gallagher does sleazy to perfection, and Laura San Giacomo is wonderful as Cynthia, the acting-out sister of Anne whom everyone deemed perfect as a child. The implosive behavior she exudes is fantastic as she tries to ruin the lives of those that love her, not realizing what the consequences are for her. Also, there is a nice cameo from Steven Brill (writer of the Mighty Ducks trilogy and collaborator with Adam Sandler) as a drunken barfly adding some real effective comic relief. The real break-through, however, is James Spader. He plays Graham with so much innocence and aloofness that you are not quite sure how to take his ""hobby"" when it is first described. His performance counteracts all the filthy deeds being done by those around him as he tries his best to right wrongs from his past. When the tables are turned and he must finally confront himself, we are treated with the best acting in the movie. The ambush both on the video by MacDowell and by Gallagher during the playing of said video juxtapose perfectly the emotions everyone in this movie feels.When Graham says that he never could take advice from someone he didn't know intimately, he meant someone he didn't have sex with. Through the course of the film, Soderbergh seems to take us on a journey showing that being intimate can occur on levels besides the physical. Graham's use of video interviews about people's sex lives allow those people to hear for themselves what they have been doing with their lives. It allows them to really know the atrocities they may have committed and the adulterous ways that may be ruining the lives of those they love. We never do find out what was so horrible in Graham's youth to make him spend nine years rehabilitating it, (we can guess from the fact he was best friends with Gallagher's character), but the man he became, the man he wanted to be, was one who cared about the world. He wasn't a selfish pervert making these tapes for personal use; he made them just as much for those he taped as himself. Graham saw the look in Cynthia's face when she came to his apartment and knew she was harboring something deep down inside her, beneath the sexuality she hid it with. By letting her express her pain through sex, he allowed her to open up to herself and listen to her conscience. So, maybe Graham is right, maybe he is not giving them advice on an intimate emotional level, but instead they are getting it from the person they are most intimate with in their livesthemselves.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
30,mattymatt4ever,"A MAGNIFICENT, UNDERRATED FILM THAT'S LIKE NOTHING I'VE EVER SEEN!!!",10,17 July 2001,"""sex, lies and videotape"" is a low-key drama that REALLY showcases Stephen Soderbergh's true talents.  The film was made on a modest budget and is mainly dialogue-driven, yet I was deeply fascinated from start to finish. This is another film that sends out a message to all aspiring directors: You don't need a large budget to make a truly great motion picture! Soderbergh hasn't received worldwide fame until recently with the hit ""Traffic.""  As much as I loved ""Traffic"" I urge everyone--who's curious of Soderbergh's work--go check out this initial effort.  The element that impressed me the most was the succint, yet brutally realistic dialogue.  I've never been more impressed with a film's dialogue and actually screamed out, ""Now THAT'S how people talk!""  The interactions between each character are so intense and down to earth, and gets the audience deeply engaged.  James Spader shines in this career-making performance as a documentary filmmaker who gets his rocks off filming women talking about sex.  We never know why he developed this unusual interest, but that's what's so great.  And the way Spader carries his character is so subtle and powerful.  His character is quiet and mysterious, and he expresses this enigmatic role perfectly with every silence, every facial gesture, every tone of voice.  That's another element that I loved. Soderbergh expresses to his audience that people don't always mean what they say.  And you can tell by every hint of body language.  During these character interplays, you get a feel for what the characters are really thinking with their every subtle nuance.  And that's what creates most of the film's tension.  And of course, the film has great depth and treats its subject with the greatest of maturity.  In one scene, Spader interviews this young woman who talks about her first experience with masturbation.  That could've easily been transformed into something gratuitous and heavy-handed.  The subjects of sex and infidelity are treated with a sense of reality, and I'm sure many couples who are involved in relationships where one of the mates are cheating will find the whole situation with Andie McDowell and Peter Gallagher haunting.  Everything is low-key and some might find the rhythm slow-moving, but that's what I liked about it.  It slowly unfolds and takes its time developing the characters and their situations.  Many filmmakers would've taken the subject of infidelity and made it into a melodramatic soap.  But Soderbergh is very patient.  He never once thinks, ""Maybe the audience is not interested anymore,"" and speeds things up.  He goes at his own pace, and works with it consistently.I don't know if others will get the same effect I did out of this movie, but appreciate a film that respects its characters and respects its dialogue. Sure, I also appreciate a film with massive entertainment value, but other times I'd rather watch something with depth and realism.  This is one of those films that just has a subtle energy.  Looking at ""sex, lies and videotape"" from the outside, it's hard to explain the power of Soderbergh's masterpiece.  All I say is go see for yourself!  I hope you'll be just as astounded.My score:  10 (out of 10)","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
31,sharky_55,"I'm wearing red, you're wearing red.",6,7 February 2016,"Sex, Lies and Videotape focuses on the marriage of Ann and John, and how they are merely getting along without any real sparks left. The opening sequence has the voiceovers of Ann's therapist session over John skimping a meeting in the middle of the day to meet a girl. There is a nice bit of subversion here because Ann's confessions aren't all doom and gloom; she's a little upset about the little things that aren't going quite right, but as far as she knows the marriage is still solid. The spanner in the works that arrives is John's old friend Graham, who is immediately pegged as an enigmatic individual from his first lines. Soderbergh's goal, however, is to subvert this notion. Ann is at once drawn to his mysterious persona; the brutal honesty and forwardness of his dialogue, his open intentions, the air of genuine concern towards the person he speaks to. And of course, he has a secret; he is impotent and cannot hold an erection, so he videotapes women talking about their sexual history and gets off to that. What this film aspires to do is not marginalise him for it, but to contrast him against the couple with all their infidelity and portray him as the normal one. He is not the one that is hurting others, and he approaches each of these women with the utmost ease until we too feel comfortable enough to open up to him and then some. It's a neat and intriguing concept for sure, but the problem is that Soderbergh seems to feel the need to intensity this contrast by completely hamming up the other main characters into insufferable clichés. Ann positively giggles when even thinking of masturbation and would never ever broach the topic of sex by herself. John is the rough, absent spouse who jokes about his wife's bad cooking and spins such a smooth story deflecting away when confronted with accusations of infidelity. Opposing her sister is the husky voiced Cynthia who ends each sentence with an unmistakable drawl and poses provocatively with every step as if to remind us she is the designated 'bad girl' and wild, carefree nympho. The camera-work betrays every instance of this predictability; the pan across to reveal the photo of loving wife Ann as John sets up another meeting Cynthia, and then later as she finds him posing on the bed. The black and white intimacy of the interview is juxtaposed with the wild frenzy of the affair sex and a dolly-zoom on Cynthia's o-face only to reap all its empty passion. Even worse is Soderbergh later compromising on Graham and festishising his character to the most agonising extremes. His impotence is suddenly magically wished away along with Ann's frigidity and they engage in a round of sensual face touching. It is suggested that his mysterious knack for getting women to broadcast all their intimate details on video has granted him some sort of license to snap up any housewives being cheated on. This is the basis of their relationship at the end, but there's nothing inspiring or cathartic about this change at all. Sex, Lies and Videotape poses that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone of them all, above anything physical, and that honesty above all is sexy and attractive. It suggests that trust is born from intimacy, and that intimacy is not born out of sex, but from something mysterious that only the long-haired James Spader with his hard hitting questions seems to possess in this messed up world.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
32,CitizenCaine,Soderbergh's Debut Film Mesmerizes,9,25 May 2004,"Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies, And Videotape was all the rage at Cannes in 1989, winning the Golden Palm Award for Soderbergh and the Best Actor Award for James Spader. Soderbergh was also nominated for an Oscar for his screenplay. Despite the lurid, voyeuristic title, this film is not really about sex at all. It's about intimacy and what it takes to reach that with another person. Lies are always a barrier to that, but who would have thought that videotape would be so useful in revealing so much about people, although it actually shows little? James Spader, late of ""The Practice"" fame, is outstanding as the old college friend that returns to his friend's town, and stirs up the truth about each character. Peter Gallagher, currently in ""The O.C."", is equally great as the lawyer, husband, who uses those in his orbit without regard to any consequences. Andie MacDowell is absolutely perfect as the conservative wife, who thinks that sex is overrated. Laura San Giacomo, from ""Just Shoot Me"", is also perfectly cast as the sexpot sister of MacDowell. All the actors, who weren't too well known at the time, give bull's eye performances. Rarely has any of them been as good since. Soderbergh's direction and screenplay are also responsible for the success of the film. Very little actually happens in the movie in terms of action, scene changes, and technical aspects of film in general. It's reminiscent of the many talky European films that are often very frank but where little happens. However, there is not a wasted moment in this film. Soderbergh gives us one of the most honest, mature depictions of the barriers to intimacy ever put on film. In doing so, he shows us that the characters are not free of their own ulterior motivations, even though some appear to change for the better. What is significant is that barriers to intimacy are just as difficult to face as the events that precipitate our facing them. The brief final shot speaks volumes with no dialog. ***1/2 of 4 stars.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
33,Stampsfightclub,Mildly interesting cover of significant real life problem,7,19 April 2009,"Married John Mullany (Gallagher) is having an affair with his wife's sister Cynthia (Giacomo) whilst the arrival of his old friend creates problems.When looking at romantic hits in the last 20 years we have seen a fair share of ups and downs. From the clichéd look at happiness and love in Richard Curtis' Love Actually to the intimate look at how friendship affects relationships in Rob Reiner's When Harry met Sally we have seen highs and lows at an important part of how love and lust affect our lives. Recently the trend has lowered where everything is set in stone such as Hitch or Intolerable Cruelty. Good films with humour but an inevitable conclusion. So where does Steven Soderbergh's picture rank?If, in the first half an hour, you become bored with the obvious predictability and over dramatic inclusion of Andie MacDowell's marriage then just think of this as build up for something mercifully better. This opening with MacDowell's protagonist Ann conversing with her therapist is frankly boring. Then we see her husband having an affair with her very own sister. So already this feels like an episode from Coronation Street. Graham's introduction though at first ultimately boring becomes interesting once we see his bizarre hobby. Finally the script all starts to make sense. This boring build up layers the foundation for Grahams' inclusion and the implication of sex and the significance of happiness in adversity. Sex is the most covered topic out of the three keywords but for some reason we barely see any so the fact that it is debated so much but shown minimally begs the question of the significance and the lack of enthusiasm for it. Nevertheless there is no shaking the subject is relative, whilst combining mildly interesting plots about affairs, unemployment and perversion.Yes, it's soapy and you pick up clues as easy as Graham picks up women but this is almost irrelative thanks to a sharp performance by Spader. He steels the light in every scene, though hardly difficult next to MacDowell's egregious act at loneliness. Gallagher and Giacomo have their moments too. During the opening stages the sound does not go in sync with the actors. The constant use of narration is overplayed and just seeing all these problems with the production does not help the film's supposed cause to preach and entertain. Compared to other classics this 1989 romance has its moments with its main issue but ultimately this is predictable and not really worth the hassle when other such romances as Rob Reiner's masterpiece or American Beauty demonstrate how to handle sex without being predictable or soapy.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
34,KnightsofNi11,Intelligence supersedes emotion,9,15 May 2011,"Steven Soderbergh's debut film is voyeuristic, intense, gripping, and intriguing. It's the story of four people. Ann is a sexually repressed woman with an obsession for cleanliness and organization. Her husband, John, is a lawyer and he is cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia. Ann lives oblivious to what is going on behind her back, despite her deteriorating sex life with John. But things really start to change Graham, an old friend of John's comes in town to visit. Graham is a strange man with an odd set of ideals who also has a fetish of filming women talk about their sexual fantasies. When these personalities conflict and intertwine things start to change dramatically and the tension rises all the way through Soderbergh's ingenious script and his quiet yet intensely focused direction of some fantastic performances.sex, lies, and videotape is a very risky film which graphically examines sex with the utmost seriousness. In this film sex isn't made into a joke like American Pie, and it isn't turned into some sadistic and grotesque motif like Se7en or Silence of the Lambs. Sex is looked at under a very dramatic and very sincere scope which treats it like any mature and significant piece of subject matter. This is what sets sex, lies, and videotape apart from so many other films of its nature. It is serious, but doesn't give the feeling that it takes itself too seriously. It has to be serious and it just wouldn't feel right for this film to not be as sincere as it is.The conversations Soderbergh has constructed here are something that need to be serious and need to be focused in order to get the artistic point across. And it is amazing how well the script is constructed. The dialouge feels incredibly real and it knows just when to pull out all of the dramatic stops. The script doesn't feel like it needs to be profoundly eloquent at all times. It is lighthearted and casual at the appropriate times, like when Graham first arrives and he, Ann, and John all sit around the dinner table casually discussing the past, the future, and life in general. But where the real genius comes in is when we realize that despite the present conversation being casual on the surface there is that constant underlying tension which escalates throughout the entire film until it all comes into fruition at the end of the film. The script has all these intelligible nuances that are absent in most ""serious"" films these days; something you don't really realize is missing until you see how well it can be done in a film like sex, lies, and videotape.Now obviously this is a very character driven story and I will admit that it is hard to build an emotional connection with any of the characters. To call them imperfect would be a grotesque understatement. The four of them are incredibly flawed people who in retrospect, aren't really good people at all. They all have serious issues that affect their lives dramatically and create situations that are inescapably awful for everyone involved. But what the film lacks in emotion it makes up for in sheer intelligence. The film is so ingeniously crafted that a strong emotional connection to the characters would only cause a distraction to the film's clever craftsmanship.It's a common misconception that you need to feel strong sympathy for your protagonists in order for a film to be good. sex, lies, and videotape doesn't intend for you to connect with these people. We are only supposed to be fascinated and awestruck at their twisted and bizarre lives. And so to me, this film does its job and it does it well. However, you do feel a strong connection to the film itself and you do want to know what will happen to these people because of the enthralling way this story is told. The absolute beautiful intensity of the script with draw you in so strongly that you won't want to miss a second of it. There comes a point where you begin to feel you must know what happens to these people because you must know how Mr. Soderbergh intends on wrapping this intriguing drama up.sex, lies, and videotape is well written, well directed, and well acted so its already set up to be a great film. But then you add the pure ingenuity of the way the story is told and what a profound examination of human relationships it is and it is now a fantastic film. This isn't one of those films where you pick out particular scenes that you really liked or specific moments that really wowed you. The entire film cumulatively works together as one single wow moment that you just adore. This isn't a film that you will be strongly moved by and it won't bring you to tears, but it isn't trying to. It is a clever and sincere drama that treats mature adult subject matter the way it should be treated. Not as a joke, but as a basis for ingenuity.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
35,spookyrat1,I Want to Know Why You Are the Way You Are!,7,18 May 2019,"I have to admit this is one film that surprised me. I didn't really expect to like it, thinking it was going to be just another talkfest. But sure as the wind blows, as the story progressed, it dragged me in.Andie MacDowell in pretty much her first leading role, really surprised me with an extremely compelling performance as the well-meaning wife caught in a dull almost sexless marriage , who at the film's outset, may well believe she is at fault, and requiring of psychiatric therapy. I've been a fan since way back with Greystoke, where her Jane was dubbed by Glenn Close. (Why I don't really know?). But there have always been critical musings concerning her alleged lack of acting ability. All I can say, is that there were instances in the second half of SL&T, where I thought she was mesmerising.Laura San Giacomo plays her sassy, uninhibited bartender sister Cynthia, who is having a long-term affair with John, Ann's husband. Into the mix is introduced Graham, an old friend of John's whose own repressions and the means he has of relieving them, will end up casting plenty of light on the title's secrets and lies. James Spader gives an understated, but alluring performance as Graham, whose knack of attracting women to talk openly about their sexual secrets on videotape, will force all four lead characters to face truths about themselves and each other.In his debut feature, writer/director Stephen Soderbergh openly reveals the creative hand he has consistently played over the years across a range of movie genres; the presentation of frank, realistic, smart dialogue. He was only 26 when he made this film and though I don't see this as being a ""great movie"" per se, it is easy after seeing it, to appreciate why Soderbergh is frequently regarded as the most influential independent director of late 20th century North American cinema.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
36,FloatingOpera7,"Human Sexuality, Adult Relationships And Dark Drama",7,7 April 2006,"Steven Soderberg's Sex, Lies And Videotape was released in 1989 and is a product of its time as well as a film that would pave the way for HBO films dealing with sex and the mind, relationships and risqué subject matter which was not so risqué in the decade that followed - the 90's. Peter Gallegher (I first got to know this actor through the popular Fox TV series ""The OC"" in which he plays the uptight, upscale divorced dad) plays John Mullany, whose wife Anne, played by Andie MacDowell, is afraid of her own sexuality and consequently bores her husband. He engages in an affair with his wife's own sister Cynthia, played by Laura San Giacomo. Things are complicated even further when a therapist (Ron Vawter) tapes his sessions with Cynthia who confesses to various sexual escapades. The plot can border on shocking sex for the sake of sex, but thanks to the fine acting by all the principal characters, this story becomes an overwhelming dark drama which deals with human sexuality, complex adult relationships and the film has a sad, tragic feel to it. Laura San Giacomo is better known as Maya from the sitcom ""Just Shoot Me"" and considering that was comedy, and this role is much darker and edgier, it attests to her versatility as an actress. The following year in 1990, she starred opposite Julia Roberts in ""Pretty Woman"". Actor James Spader plays a creepy, seducer and he is nearly the same fellow he portrays in the later 2002 ""Secretary"". It's clear these types of films are his forte. This film is not to be viewed by sensitive or young viewers, as it has that R rated material one sees in HBO or other cables shows. This is not a silly, vulgar story without any real merit or meaning. It has a powerful message about infidelity, about the nature of adult male and female sexuality and this film has a small following of its own. Soderberg directs with great flair. We see close-ups when we need to see them, we get silences when the characters are reflecting on past misconducts and we also get a love triangle. It's a dark film but it never borders on pure debauchery. It's a film that makes you think.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

Soderbergh's early film is not has high-budget and edited flashily as his other pictures, but its effective in telling its story and was pretty interesting throughout. The performances were pretty good, spader was decent as was Gallagher but San Giacomo and MacDowell were pretty good. I heard a lot of hype about spader's performance but he wasn't extraordinary here. I liked this film, but at times it seemed a bit contrived and the characters actions were a bit out of sync with the rest of the film. --- IMDb Rating: 7.0, my rating: 8/10","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
38,braddugg,A stimulating and thought provoking film about relationships.,8,8 September 2014,"A stimulating and thought provoking film about relationships.This film can be considered as a pioneer in showing relationships up close and personal and how embarrassing, revelations can be. There is an emphasis of sex between husband and wife and how much sexual satisfaction means in a relationship. This is an offending film for few may be, but most for many aficionados who watch films for sheer pleasure above all else this film cater many needs of a viewer.I love the simplicity depicted and the audacity of the issue. It's for sure a highly important issue for a relationship even though it's not much discussed about with others. I suppose that if a husbands impotency if discussed, the society looks at the wife as a whore and the other way if a husband speaks of wife's inability, he is considered as a predator by women. Having said that, love making is a prime humane exercise that as humans we got to do and it's a kind of motivator for many many activities that we do. There is a scene in which Ann (Andie Mcdowell) confesses that she was never satisfied by her husband John (Peter Gallagher) while her husband watches the videotape. Such revelations are never thrown light and only a few films have such effrontery and this film is certainly is a pioneer in that direction. There are lot of infidelity films by the great Woody Allen where infidelity is made to be cynical and comical, but here it's liberating and that's a take way. When you tell all you have in your heart, you are liberated and that's a good thing to do.Steven Soderbergh made this as his first feature film and has since rose to prominence where he has made commercial films on a grand scale too. But this one seemed to be his most personal best and I love him for sticking to that, and making this film an approachable work by it's simplistic style with an intriguing title. Also, it's an independent film and that makes it more meaningful to the movie buffs and wannabes coz if there is a story to tell, it can be made without the embellishments and yet be made competently well. For this film and it's many positives I derived this morning, I am going with 4/5. This is not a film that can be watched with friends, but it has to be made out with spouse and this can be a wonderful experience.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
39,MichaelMargetis,"""A personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more... personal, I guess. "" - Graham",7,26 November 2005,"'Sex, Lies and Videotape' is a film that was very controversial for it's day, and now it's just kind of mild. The film explores the sexual aspects of four people, Ann (Andie MacDowell - Groundhog's Day), John (Peter Gallagher - American Beauty), Cynthia (Laura San Giacamo - TV's 'Just Shoot Me') and Graham (James Spader - TV's Boston Legal). Ann and John are happily married on the outside, but not on the inside. Ann is seeing a psychiatrist, and John is being unfaithful to his wife with her sister, Cynthia. All their secrets get unearthed when Graham, an old college buddy of John's, comes into town with his video camera and his curiosity. That's about all of the film I'll tell you. I don't want to give anything away, so that you will get more out of the film when viewing it. Steven Sodebergh does a decent job with his directorial debut, some elements of his directing were really sloppy while others ran smoothly. The dialogue is pitch-perfect, but the film drags a lot during the middle. The saving grace of 'Sex, Lies and Videotape' is definitely the acting. James Spader gives his finest performance as the intricate Graham while Andie MacDowell perfects her role of the puritan-like housewife who deep down has a burning curiosity for sex. The supporting actors of the film are Peter Gallagher who does a totally believable job as the lowest form of life on the planet, a lawyer, while Laura San Giacamo also very believable as a ""loose"" woman. All actors perfect their roles, Spader and McDowell more noticeably in roles that should have won them Academy Award Nominations. 'Sex, Lies & Videotape' has some major flaws and short-comings but overall it's a pretty good film. It was nominated for one Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Grade: B","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

Since it's kind of talky I guess it doesn't suit every film viewer out there, but it is incredibly well-acted (especially by James Spader), very fascinating and the characters in the film are very interesting. Highly recommended! (8/10)","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
41,Angeneer,Worth seeing once,7,30 March 2006,"Sex, Lies and Videotape is one of those films that you have to see simply because it created a major buzz at its time. It's a decent viewing for one time, but it's not something special to write home about. Unfortunately, people have taken it more seriously than what they should and at some points, the movie does the same thing itself. No groundbreaking social commentary is to be found here, just a confirmation that eroticism is based in the mind more than the flesh, which is not that original anyway. Perhaps the eighties newfound passion with home video is what made the difference.Soderbergh's proficient direction sets the mood and helps in creating tension as the end of the film nears. It's perhaps the best part of the movie. As of performances, a perfectly cast Peter Gallagher tops the list and then comes Laura San Giacomo. I haven't been able to like Andie MacDowell in any of her roles and this is not an exception, although she's better than her average. I especially didn't like at all James Spader, I wonder how he got an award at Cannes! Finally, the dialogue. At some points, the lines were absolutely ridiculous. Anybody remember the idiotic bathroom lines when MacDowell and Spader first meet? Or the pointless talk about the rain at the end?","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
42,domino1003,A great little film with a great little cast (Spoilers),10,20 June 2004,"""Sex,Lies and Videotape"" works well because the film is tightly structured around 4 people. Anyone else that comes into the picture (Ann's therapist, the landlord)seems to intruded into the tight group. John and Ann (Peter Gallagher and Andie MacDowell)looks like the perfect couple on the surface. Underneath...John is a scumbag, cheating on his wife with her own sister, Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo, who just smolders through the film). Ann refuses to let her husband touch her. Although she doesn't know about the affair, she senses something is wrong. Enter into the mix is Graham (James Spader, in a surprising role). Graham's presence brings changes into the lives of John, Ann and Cynthia, and it all has to do with his hobby: videotaping women talking about sex. From the moment he appears, nothing will ever be the same.Amazing that Steven Soderbergh made an intimate film that deals with sex, and yet there is none to be seen (Only a few hot moments, but no nudity). But it is sex that fuels the movie (Graham can't have sex because he's impotent;the only way he can gratify himself is watching women talk about sex), Ann doesn't want to have sex, John is ruining his career and marriage because of sex, and Cynthia is ruining her relationship with her sister because of sex). When the moment comes when Ann finds out that her world is a lie, she comes to Graham and tells him she wants to do a video. This causes the greatest change between the 2.Kudos to the cast and Soderbergh, who made a huge film with a little budget (Nearly $2 million to make, and grossed nearly $25 million!).","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
43,pfgpowell-1,For once a film lives up to the praise heaped on it. One for those who really like films,8,30 March 2012,"We all have faults and one of mine is a kind of anti-fashion. So I hate to jump on bandwagons, or even be thought to be jumping on a bandwagon. Actually, the way I behave - refusing on principle to wear a pink and purple boa constrictor this year because it is all the rage - is just as silly as the behaviour of those who this year simply dread, but dread, my dear, not being seen in one.The relevance these obscure comments have to Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape is that it is lauded to high heaven - and then some - by the great and good in the world of film and is compared with some of the greatest films ever made, and that I am thus rather loath to add my praise: I don't want to be thought of as part of the in crowd, see. But now I have got that off my chest I can come out and say it: it is one of the better films to have been made these past 40 and truly deserves the praise it garners. Ironically, it is not 'the story' which makes it great - which is, in fact, quite slight - but the performances Soderbergh coaxes out of his actors, with not a bum note struck by any of them. That in itself, given the odd pastime of James Spader's character - he videotapes strangers talking about themselves and their sex lives - is something of a high-wire act. It could all so easily have gone so wrong.A second irony is that the central theme is not sex at all but emotion and how much they can influence our lives. So Andie McDowell's lawyer's wife Ann lives a celibate almost frigid life, Spader's character Graham has become impotent, and Ann's sister Cynthia, who has afternoon sex sessions with Ann's husband John, is more interested in getting back at her sister by doing so than in the sex itself. When Graham returns to his hometown after nine years - we are never told quite why, what he has been doing or how he supports himself - those four lives all spin out of control, but the conclusion for three of them - Ann, Graham and Cynthia - is that they are able bit by bit to emerge from the emotional dead-end they had pushed themselves into and seem rather happier for it. The only loser is the lawyer, John, who not only loses his wife and mistress but his job and, I should imagine, reputation.What makes it all so very satisfying is that every element of the film fits into it place - the acting, the quite direction, the quiet camera work and the soundtrack - so that, as so rarely happens, the film ends up as a whole. There is no great depth in it and no truths are revealed, but then Soderbergh doesn't have any pretensions in that direction.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

There are aspects of it like the editing, James Spader's performance which though calm on the surface constantly hints at the darkness simmering beneath, some of the subtle camera work, etc. which I can admire.

45,mwilson1976,Steven Soderbergh's debut film is a talky 80's drama about bad people doing very bad things,6,24 February 2020,"Steven Soderbergh's indie hit about the tangled relationships among four people and a video camera, was a sensation at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or and an award for James Spader as best actor. It went on to revolutionise the independent film movement of the early nineties. Soderbergh conceived the film over a year but wrote the script in just over a week (apparently on a yellow legal pad whilst on a cross country road trip). It is light on action and heavy on chat, and has probably been overhyped, it is the type of movie people like to name check at dinner parties just to show how on the pulse they are. Soderbergh originally wanted Elizabeth McGovern to play the role of the sexually reluctant Ann, but her agent apparently hated the script so much that she never even got to read it. The part went to Andie MacDowell instead, who impressed after two successful auditions. In 2006 the movie was selected and preserved by the United States National Film Registry as being deemed as culturally significant. Sex, Lies and Videotape has also been adapted into a stage play, and the 2002 movie Full Frontal was originally conceived as an unofficial sequel of sorts.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

A fourth character, an old college friend who has changed over the years, visits as a house guest for a few days. 2 guys, 2 girls. Friends, sisters, affairs. Underneath what seems to be another typical romantic drama? A rare approach and perspective. This film is really about how conversation and words can be dramatically sexier than the physical mingling of the bodies. Soderbergh says, ""Video is a way of distancing ourselves from people and events. We tend to think that we can experience things because we watched them on tape. For Graham this was an aspect of myself taken to an extreme measure. He needs the distance to feel free to react without anybody watching, which, I guess, is the definition of voyeurism, even though I think voyeurism has mostly negative connotations."" ""I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love the person that they're attracted to, and that women become more and more attracted to the person that they love."" ""I am telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say ""That's why!"" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy!

48,dr_clarke_2,A very assured and stylish debut from Steven Soderbergh,7,18 July 2021,"1989's Sex, Lies and Videotape marked the arrival of a major new talent in American cinema. The film was the directorial debut of Steven Soderbergh, whose career would subsequently see him become one of the most acclaimed independent filmmakers of his generation, responsible for several big-budget films that have been both critical and financial successes. As a first feature film, Sex, Lies and Videotape is quite remarkable: whilst it would be an exaggeration to say that Soderbergh was at the top of his game from his very beginning, it is nevertheless a very assured and stylish piece of filmmaking.Soderbergh not only directed Sex, Lies and Videotape, he also wrote it, reportedly rather quickly. The film is a character piece, focusing on a handful of people, including Andie MacDowell's Ann Bishop Mullany, who is unhappily married to Peter Gallagher's John, as the opening counselling scene reveals. John meanwhile is having an affair with Ann's extrovert sister, Laura San Giacomo's Cynthia. Enter James Spader's Graham Dalton, an old friend of John's who moves in until he finds his own place. Graham is a drifter who is living off his savings (a lazy but convenient narrative contrivance that explains how he affords to rent a flat and drive a car), who occupies his time by videotaping interviews with women who agree to talk about the minutiae of their sex lives. Predictably, he ends up videotaping first Cynthia and later Ann, and equally predictably he forms a relationship with the latter, who even more predictably finds out about John's affair with her sister.This excessive predictability probably results from Soderbergh's inexperience as a writer, but he gets away with it because this is a film about sex and relationships, and the audience has certain expectations. This is why Ann ultimately ends up with Graham and also why John gets fired from his highly paid job as a lawyer even though there is no logical explanation for why this should be other than that it is dramatically satisfying (his boss must *really* disapprove of infidelity). The story and the character work anyway, because Soderbergh demonstrates a knack for capturing the complexities of people convincingly; even if the characters themselves are probably not realistic, they become believable. Soderbergh teases out as much background detail about his characters during the small talk scenes as he does during the counselling and sex tape scenes, which of course focus on characters talking about themselves. Everybody in the film is flawed in some way, a typical Soderbergh trait: John and Cynthia both betray Ann, whilst Graham is impotent in the presence of women and instead masturbates whilst watching his videos of those he interviews. Ann meanwhile is appalled when Cynthia reveals that she let Graham tape her, even though she's obviously tempted to let him do the same to her, which she eventually does.The casting is excellent, with Spader (who excels at playing oddballs) giving a convincing performance as the decidedly eccentric, awkward Graham. MacDowell - whose career has been somewhat variable - is surprisingly good as Ann, conveying through her performance that the character is obviously fascinated by Graham and repulsed by her own fascination. Gallagher is suitably slimy as John, whilst Giacomo seems well suited to playing the sexually uninhibited Cynthia.But the most striking aspect of the film is that, right at the start of his career, it demonstrates Soderbergh's art house aesthetic in every perfectly composed frame. His fondness for lingering close-ups of his actors' faces is in evidence throughout, whilst the screenplay allows him to show off: when Graham watches the videotape of his interview with Cynthia, actual videotape footage is used. Similarly when John watches Ann's video, although on this occasion the film then cuts back to them talking at the time of filming, an early example of the non-linear narrative that he will occasionally employ in subsequent films. There's also a subtle but effective score by former drummer Cliff Martinez, that enhances the films atmosphere without overwhelming the performances or overtly telling the audience what to feel.Soderbergh has made better films that Sex, Lies and Videotape, but he's also made worse: that he was capable of producing such an accomplished - and indeed award-winning - movie so early on in his career makes it unsurprising that he grabbed film critics' attention and has made them watch his work like a hawk ever since.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
49,kijii,Watching life being lived rather than a story being told,8,27 November 2016,"I remember seeing this in a theater when it was first released. It was one of Steven Soderbergh's first movies, and it seemed like something new in movie making at the time. It still does. It was one of the pioneering movies in the world of the independent movie industry. Therefore, it is no coincidence that when I recently re-saw it, it was being shown on the IFC. This movie gives us a framework of its entire content in its title, for it is all about the three concepts of the title and how they are—or can be—interrelated. By basically limiting the movie to three concepts and four characters, the movie can relate a wealth of insight on a very economic scale. There is very little clutter in the movie. At times, we feel like we are seeing life being lived rather than a story being told. However, by the end of the movie, we understand the distinct nature of each of the characters of the movie and how each fits into the story's title.To begin with, we see a sexually repressed woman, Ann Bishop Mullany (Andie MacDowell), in analysis. She is the wife of an up-and-coming lawyer, John (Peter Gallagher). But, while Ann is in analysis, John, is under the sheets having sex with Ann's sister, Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo). The LIES that we are exposed to at this point are everywhere with these three characters. The lies center around SEX!!When John's old college roommate, Graham (James Spader), unexpectedly arrives at their house for a short stay, he is much changed since the last time that John saw him nine years ago. Graham is disturbingly truthful about himself and his woebegone condition. He is also truthful about telling John that he is a liar--simply because he is a lawyer.When Ann and Graham are alone, she slowly draws him out and learns to relate to his truthfulness. The truth about Graham is that he is impotent and compensates for his impotence by interviewing women on VIDEOTAPE. Now, all four characters and three concepts of the movie's title have been broached. The movie's title makes it seem as though it is a XXX movie but it isn't. It's more like a chamber piece. Put another way, it is like the child's game of Rock—Paper--Scissors, but this time the game is turned into an adult revelation. The puzzle of how the game of Sex— Lies--Videotape relate and complete the circle is revealed in the movie's climax.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
50,blakiepeterson,An Icy Character Study,6,2 May 2015,"""Men learn to love the person they're attracted to, and women become more and more attracted to the person that they love,"" Graham Dalton (James Spader) says. He's heard the quote somewhere in the past, but he can't quite recall its origin. Was it from a misty romantic comedy? A philosophical book? Who cares: the characters in ""sex, lies, and videotape"" have certainly not been lucky enough in life to make that romantic sounding sentiment a reality, spending the next 99 minutes exploring differing levels of sexual dissatisfaction. Most famous for starting the independent film movement back in 1989, sex, lies, and videotape is possibly one of those movies that thrives on its buzz but, as a standalone film, is underwhelming. Perhaps I am expecting too much. Should I not? The release poster flaunts an imposing amount of enticing quotes from glowing critical reviews, calling it things like ""an edgy, intense comedy!"" or ""the season's smartest and funniest film!"" Considering every headline ends in an exclamation point and uses labels like ""comedy"" and ""funniest"" for description, I guess I anticipated a callously absurd dialogue driven film, a Cat on a Hot Tin Roof for the next generation.sex, lies, and videotape turned out to be none of the things I thought it would be. To be fair, I should not be letting my expectations get in the way of my critique, but like the release of a new Prince album, there is an unavoidable hope that something game changing will be at store. But sometimes, hope isn't as strong as you'd like it to be, and the film, dare I say it, is overrated. It's intrigued with dialogue and likes to play with it, not quite unsentimental and not quite stilted. The film has the talky honesty of an Off-Broadway play that quakes in the escalating importance of conversation — but it doesn't tremble in the same way Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? did, which had such boiling dialogue that the characters became more interesting than any sort of story. sex, lies, and videotape analyzes the sex lives of four characters: John (Peter Gallagher), his wife Ann (Andie MacDowell), her sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo), and John's old college friend, Graham. John is a fruitful yuppie who disrespects his marriage by sleeping with the abrasive Cynthia, who is irritated by her sister's lifelong, despicable goody-two-shoes personality. Ann takes comfort in the financially stable confines of her union; she has lost interest in sex, believing it to be unimportant in comparison to other types of human interaction. Graham, coming into town nine years after his last encounter with John, is impotent, receiving his erotic kicks by recording women talk about sex in front of a low-budgeted camera. By the end of the film, Cynthia and Ann will have partaken in Graham's eccentric means of arousal, changing their lives for the better.Writing reviews for films like sex, lies, and videotape are the hardest kinds of reviews to write; the dialogue is good, the direction is good, the acting is good, the editing is good, etc., etc., etc., the only flaw lying in the fact that I plain and simply did not connect with the film emotionally. Many laud it for the same reasons that I didn't much enjoy it; the slice-of-life earnestness felt anticlimactic to me, while others appreciated its realism. I never felt like I knew Ann and Graham well enough to sympathize with their paralleling frigidity; their personal hardships didn't leave me feeling, well, anything.But if I didn't savor sex, lies, and videotape as much as I would have liked to, there is still plenty of things it does well. Soderbergh's handling of the direction and screenplay is methodical and gradual, hugely mature for a filmmaker who was only 26 at the time. The voyeuristic attitude of the film is uncomfortable but perfectly watchable, the sexual issues between the characters contrasting with complementary dysfunction; the acting is similarly balanced, the actors all subtle but well-cast.sex, lies, and videotape makes for a number of firsts. It was Steven Soderbergh's first feature in a versatile and impressive career. It was the first time the actors had been able to strut their acting abilities with such unbridled intensity. It was the film that made the independent film industry a force to be reckoned with. I didn't love it, but you might. Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
51,dataconflossmoor,Calling All Proclivities,10,18 August 2002,"A classic case of where the mechanics of marriage become the insidious culprit to sexual indiscretion...John Millaney is the overly mortgaged white collar malcontent who is callous with his regard toward marital fidelity...He has an affair with his wife's sister, Cynthia Bishop, she is a morally bankrupt loner who resents her sister's relatively structured existence...Gram Dalton is the voyeuristic creep who preys on the dissatisfaction of married women with the seven year itch syndrome, and other disgruntled and socially misplaced women as well!! He perceives vulnerability in women to be sexually stimulating!! His ultimate undoing is his creative resolution to boredom, and this basically backfires in an absolutely horrendous way!!! Ann Millaney (John's wife) is torn between a perfect marriage and an emotional millennium.. She is convinced that not only does doing things her way work, IT MUST!!. It is not necessary to have all the missing pieces to the puzzle in her marriage because she realizes the ramifications of such a heinous plight!! What presses everyone's buttons? Is it kink, is it bi, or bi for the night, is it emotional nurturing?...James Spader's character (Gram Dalton) has a life that is based on comparative stability, everybody (mostly women) can expose their lewd nuances while he keeps his a secret, once someone has tampered with his quirkiness which is close to the vest, he has no ability to cope, thus, he exaggerates his mistakes!!!All of the characters in this film are hit with the grim reality that not accepting responsibility accomplishes nothing....They all engage in a form of permanent self destruction!! Being flippant about immorality has a definite rude awakening!! What seems complicated is really very simple, and the depraved intrigue of perversion merely brings out all of their most dreaded skeletons in the closet!!!! Seldom in a film is there such a precise poignancy about things that bother people that really should not bother them at all...This is what gets them into so much trouble!! Steven Soderbergh's production efforts in this film were merely a harbinger of things to come, as he has gone on to produce and direct fabulous movies (""Good Night and Good Luck"", ""Syrianna"", and ""Traffic"", to name but a few!!) This film effectuates a noteworthy devotion to an unintentional and sordid sexual authenticity!! Sundance is a network for the non-conventional..""Sex Lies and Videotape"" is testament to the fact that what appears gray flannel is not always the panacea people would like to believe it to be!! Marital upheaval is all about emotional affliction in this movie. Latent reactions are a manifestation of psychological insecurity. You are never going to get what you want out of a relationship because you don't know what that is!! This was the summon substance of what the film ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" was all about!! This film had a personal dedication to it as well!!A very well made film, I give it 5 stars!!!","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
52,quinimdb,"Sex, Lies, and Videotapes",8,14 April 2016,"The first thing to know about ""Sex, Lies, and Videotapes"" is that it's a film about sex that doesn't have any nudity. Well, it's more about the psychology of the characters and their various viewpoints on sex, than the sex itself. It's almost like watching a very intimate therapy session involving 4 people, but way more entertaining than that sounds.The characters viewpoints in short are that one doesn't care about sex and thinks it's not a big deal, two do it all the time and it seems they do it for the thrill of sneaking around, and one is impotent, but thinks that it brings a person significantly closer to another. All of their viewpoints change by the end of the film, most of them finding a sort of balance in sex. Basically it can mean something if it's with the right person.There is a lot of tension in this film, but all the tension comes from the psychology of the various characters and who each character trusts. By the end of the film we learn just as much about them as they do about themselves.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
53,cosmorados,John and I used to be very much alike.,9,27 June 2008,"Ann is having a crisis of confidence. Her therapy is going nowhere as she hides from her own sexual problems using everyday insignificant issues, however as her husband John has invited Graham and old school friend from the town to stay for awhile she has other things to think about, and immerses herself in preparing for his arrival. When he finally does show and is charming and pleasant and not a shameless go-getter, Ann is surprised. While she entertains Graham however, John continues his ongoing affair with Ann's sister Cynthia who is free from all of the sexual hang-ups that her sister suffers from.As time goes by we learn more about Graham, the big thing being that he doesn't lie, he also carries with him a secret, his secret being that he cannot maintain an erection in the presence of a woman, choosing to reveal this to Ann, although as he does so he is not sure why? He also has a secret he does not reveal which is that he tapes women talking about sex in order that he gets off.This is the mix that Steven Soderbergh combines to create an amazing film that sucks the viewer into this strangely disturbing, yet, beautiful world as the different elements come together to form a very different picture of relationships and the human condition that goes with you after you leave the cinema.The music is, well, not really music, more like a concoction of sound to go with the mood at a particular moment, but it captures the mood more elegantly than any attempted tune could. The performances by Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher are great as the couple whose relationship is just a concoction of lies, while James Spader is immaculate as the quietly disastrous Graham who has found a unique way to push women away while getting close enough to them to feel sexually close to them.A great film that I sadly see in a lot of bargain bins because, like so many films of the eighties, it's association with this period of cinema, makes it regarded as somehow less than it is, when it is so much more than the sum of the era that spawned it.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

The plot is interesting but I think it could have been better developed specially the parts of the character of Graham.Ann and John are a young married couple who doesn't have sex anymore and John is cheating Ann with her sister Cynthia. One day Graham, a John's old friend, visits them and changes their empty lives with his videocamara which records women talking about their sex experiences .......6.5 stars = regular +","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
56,CinefanR,Interesting approach,10,2 May 2013,"It's about sincerity and closeness, and how this closeness is achieved through conversation, not necessarily sex. The main attraction here is James Spader and his enigmatic character. The mystery around him is enough to keep you watching, and Spader's performance is captivating as usual. This actor has a sort of surreal edge that makes him fascinating. All the others are memorable in their roles, especially the younger sister.Special credit must be given to the outstanding score, which emphasizes the dramatic build-up. It's discrete, mysterious and it's in the right places, and puts a neat finishing touch to Soderbergh's project. Because the movie does look like a filmmaker's personal project. It's very close and personal, with documentary-like sequences and private conversations filmed indoors. Everything clicks - acting, script, direction, and there is a satisfying simplicity to it. Soderbergh is known for his daring, smart experiments (""Schizopolis"", anyone?) and this is one of his best.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
57,MagicStarfire,Splendid performance by James Spader,10,31 March 2006,"Ever since I saw James Spader shampoo Maggie G.'s hair in Secretary, I've been a BIG fan.Spader is definitely in my top 5 of all time best actors. Nobody can portray a sympathetic oddball the way Spader can. He doesn't just play a character in a movie, he inhabits the character and makes it 3 dimensional.Once again - Jimmy Spader delivers in this very entertaining film.John, a lawyer, (Peter Gallagher - who really ought to consider tweezering his eyebrows just a tad), thinks he's got his life pretty well in hand. Oh, his wife, Ann (Andie MacDowell - very pretty but shows too much gum line when she smiles, and should dye her hair auburn), isn't interested in sex with him, but John makes up for that by rolling in the sheets with Ann's sister, Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo.) Cynthia is everything Ann isn't - which might have a lot to do with why Ann has some of the hang-ups she's got. Ann is in therapy but she's not really making much progress.Then Graham (James Spader - looking like he's about 17, with beautiful hair down to his shoulders) comes breezing into town. A former school chum of John's, he has been invited by John (who didn't bother to get Ann's agreement) to stay overnight at John and Ann's house.Graham isn't very good at typical social chit-chat, as Ann quickly discovers. He is, however, quite intriguing and far more honest than anyone she's ever met before.Graham is definitely different. For one thing he has a collection of videotapes of conversations/interviews he's had with various women on the topic of sex.Ann is somewhat horrified when she discovers this about Graham, shortly after helping him find an apartment. Cynthia, however, is highly intrigued, when Ann tells her about it.Soon everyone's life is turned upside down, all because of sex, lies and videotape.I gave this film 10 stars.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
58,Supachewy,"A Pure, Raw, Emotional Film",8,20 August 2010,"Sex, Lies, and Videotape is a modern day drama from director Stephen Soderbergh starring James Spader, Andie MacDowell, and Peter Gallagher.The film starts off with Anne (MacDowell) in her therapists office telling how her husband (Gallagher) has invited an old friend, Graham (Spader), to stay at their house without her permission. She reveals to the therapist that her marital life is poor and then there is a cut to her husband having an affair with another woman who is later revealed to be Anne's sister. When Graham arrives he is not the old friend that John remembers because he changed quite a bit. Anne is instantly attracted to him because the fact that he is impotent and she feels that society as a whole values sex too much. It is then revealed that Graham videotapes women talking about sex and that is when all the sex, lies, and videotapes truly begins.The writing for this film was truly original and deserves the Oscar Nomination it received. The script for this film has so much depth, you understand how the minds of the characters operate and that only happens rarely in films. The plot was intriguing the whole way through and the film had a sense of purity about it. The only thing I didn't like was the ending because it wasn't very memorable but for a film like this one it is about the ride it takes you on.The acting in this film was quite good, MacDowell was excellent as Anne. She finely portrayed the qualities of innocence that Anne had and was easily the most relatable and sentimental character. Spader gave a solid performance as Graham also portraying innocence and an odd feeling about him. His performance could have been better, but he did just fine all the same. Gallagher gave a good performance as the husband having an affair, it is not an unusual role for an actor to have to play, and he did a good job at it but nothing extraordinary.The direction of this film was very good which shows why Stephen Soderbergh is one of the biggest directors in Hollywood today. He had many complex shots and did a great job of letting the audience get to know the characters. He truly put together one of the greatest first feature films of any director.The score for this film was outstanding, it was right in all the right places. It was sentimental, suspenseful, it was truly magnificent.Overall I would give this film a solid 8/10, definitely worth watching just because it is Stephen Soderbergh's first feature film. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to watch genres or films with pure, raw emotion.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
59,canadude,"Lies and Videotape, but mostly talk",7,31 May 2004,"Yes, ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" is about sex, lies and videotape. And, while the sex is mostly served in dialogue-form and not a single shot of nudity is present, there is some graphic lying and some explicit videotape. Kinky, right?Well, not really. ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" is Steven Sodenbergh's first film and it's not a bad one. It's just not entirely worthy of the praise it received, at Cannes for example. The situations in the film do create a fair amount of tension that moves the story along. But then, it'd be hard not to have some tension in a film about a woman whose husband is cheating on her with her sister, while she starts interacting with a stranger who is the husband's old college roommate and has a strange videotape fetish and may or may not be a pathological liar. (How do you believe someone who just confessed to having been a pathological liar to not being one anymore? The film doesn't really riddle that one for us.)Clearly, these characters clash together. But it's not as heated or interesting as it was in later Sodenbergh's films like the spectacular ""Traffic."" The dialogues in ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" range from good to incredibly awkward. But the real strength of the film is the actors. While James Spader clearly stands out - I have never seen him deliver such a subtle performance where every scene simply works for him - Andie McDowell is phenomenal, Peter Gallagher playing the scummy, treacherous husband yuppie lawyer type is great and Laura San Giacomo as the vulgar sister / lover is fabulous. Their performances make the script work, which, under normal circumstances with inferior actors would have seemed rather silly.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
60,thehappychuckler,Great Acting Shines in Dialogue Friendly Drama,8,17 September 2019,"A great little film written and directed by Steven Soderbergh. In fact this was his first film which garnered him an Oscar nomination for the screenplay. Now, if you are into action movies or need to have lots of excitement on the screen this film probably is not for you. It is dialogue-driven and certainly about the characters on the screen. In fact the first 10 minutes of the film I was not into it and was questioning if I should just skip the film entirely. I stuck through it though and am glad I did.It's the story of a hubby John (Peter Gallagher) who spends his day working as a lawyer. When not in the office he is cheating on his wife Ann (great performance by Andie MacDowell) with her sister Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo). An old friend of John's named Graham (wonderful performance by James Spader) comes to town. I could see it coming about 1,000 miles away by Ann and Graham start a relationship together that blossoms, I don't want to give too much away but along the way she like us the viewer she learns more about Graham and the videotapes that he has and what exactly is on them.I am really glad I watched this film and will need to view ti again, but it may be one of those love it or hate it type of movies.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
61,MyDarkStar,Soderbergh shows genius early,8,3 April 2002,"For all intensive purposes, this is Steven Soderbergh's directorial debut. That fact is never apparent once throughout the movie - not once. Soderbergh applies his great touch to this movie in very discreet ways. I think the most effective is in the way he sums up an entire relationship by showing quick sequences which feature exchanged glances or small, but revealing, interactions between two characters. That's what I mean about ""discreet"". He never gets up in your face with this film. He gives the viewer more of a fly-on-the-wall type of point of view. Which is perfect for the subject matter.Soderbergh also wrote (and was nominated for) the script.With all that said, I don't want to overlook the four great performances here by the main cast (James Spader, Peter Gallagher, Andie MacDowell, Laura San Giacomo). For all four of them, I feel it is their best performance ever. Each one of them really nails the character. This is especially true for Spader. At times he's confident, and self-righteous. At times he is desperate and pathetic.Great movie.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
62,Aphex97,Spader is amazing!,10,8 November 2001,"Spader's character was the reason I enjoyed the film so much. I could identify with him and his dilemma. It seemed he felt like a stranger in an even stranger land. Who were these humans that seem so happy in the same world he could not find happiness within? What is this life we live? More importantly, what is the point? Why bother? His great battle with existence was a philosophical one. He, like myself, felt infinite sadness over the knowledge that are no concrete answers...The movie is also interesting because it attacks the main sexual organ, the mind. Graham while trying to distance himself from the human experience by capturing sex confessionals on videotape, perhaps unwittingly became more intimate with his ""partners."" Roger Ebert points out that the films' argument is that conversation is better than sex.Personally, I think the movie is about trying to find happiness with another person. Some Modest Mouse song lyrics come to mind. ""And it's hard to be a human being/ And it's harder as anything else/ and I'm lonesome when you're around/ I'm never lonesome when I'm by myself"" Graham finds it hard to be a human being and live in this human world full of values that he finds strange, confusing, and most importantly unfulfilling. What do you do when your ideology and needs don't mesh in the society you live within? How does one deal with feelings of loneliness in a society that spurns him?  This movie is about one man's way.James Spader does such an excellent job as this character. In fact, great acting all around by the entire cast and excellent writing and directing by Mr. Soderbergh. Go see this movie now!","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

But lies also bring pleasure, don't they? Look at John's indulgence. The videotape is the need to express, and it is an another more real outlet.

65,Pelagia,Intriguing Character.,10,12 May 2000,"*** Warning *** Contains Spoilers ***Much of the life surrounding the initial three characters (Gallagher, McDowell, and San Giacomo) plays out like a tv soap opera; they are stereotypical 30-somethings caught in a hollow world dominated by sex and social status.  At the center of this love triangle is McDowell, the frigid, introvert hausfrau that suffers from the affair between her husband and her extrovert sister.  Basically, there is not much going on here to take note of.Then comes Spader, the old college buddy.  Its obvious from the sexual tension that pervades the early dialogue between Spader and McDowell that he is the dark stranger who will eventually release her from her loveless marriage.  Big deal.But wait.Out of nowhere, Spader reveals he is impotent.  Hmmm.  Then he reveals an even stranger tidbit about himself.  He has a particular fetish of videotaping women engaged in explicit conversations about their sex lives. Wow.  Suddenly I have become drawn in to his character, and surely enough, all 3 of the other characters have become drawn in also to the enigmatic Spader and his fetish.As the sexual hangups of the other 3 characters eventually cross paths with Spader, who seems to want nothing to do with them, the role of his character comes into question.  There seems a subtle crafty intelligence here, something that slips underneath the tough exterior of San Giacomo and somehow convinces her to a sensitive, not at all contrived videotape interview with Spader.  Spader seems a sort of psychoanalyst, his videotape fetish a form of new therapy.Spader's character is what makes this movie so brilliant.  Everything about his dark personality leads to the final psychological battle between himself and McDowell.  Although it seems a bit rushed, we learn a bit about Spader's own sexual hangups, a slight glimpse into his past, and feel sorry for him, he seems so complex, so unlike the stereotypes of the other 3 characters that one can only fall in love with him.  He is what drives the movie, what makes it so brilliant.  Without him, the movie fails to be anything more than cheap daytime tv material.10 out of 10.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

70,Radiant_Rose,Hidden Depths,10,7 February 2011,"I was disappointed by this film the first time I saw it, but for some reason I gave it another chance. And now it has found its way into my affections as my favourite film.On the surface, it seems that nothing much happens. Apart from Graham (James Spader) slowly running out of the ingredients for iced tea ... Yes, the characters talk a lot and there is some sex, but compared to most films, everything is rather humdrum ...(I believe that a rival director described the film as being about a man ... masturbating.) But if you look more closely, all sorts of things are happening. Cynthia (Laura San Giacomo) is an atypical 1980s heroine: she knows what she wants (financial independence, sex, her artwork, her plants) and she goes for what she wants. And gets it. She even ends up on reasonably good terms with the sister with whom she has clearly had problems dating back to their childhood.Ann (Andie MacDowell) is an unassertive character who ends up taking back some of the control over her life which she handed over to her husband John (Peter Gallagher - good in a rather thankless role).And writer-director Steven Soderbergh has such an unusual twist on themes. You hear the words ""sex, lies and videotape"" and think that a lot of films contain those three ingredients. True, but how many also contain blackmail? Almost all of them. It is the presence of the items, minus the expected element of blackmail, that makes this special. Plus, what do you think when you hear a film is about a man who is impotent (unless alone) and has no job? Were you thinking it was a grim British film, probably set up North somewhere? I would have been.Although the film is well-written and well-edited, there are still some small mysteries for fans to pore over. Where does Graham get his money from? Do he and Ann have full sex on the occasion when she decides to seduce him? I rather like the hints that Graham may have experimented with his sexuality (reference to being impotent in the presence of another person, rather than specifying a woman; saying he preferred taping women to taping men).There are lots of little mysteries about the accessories: Cynthia and Graham each own a dart board. Does this mean anything? Is so, what? (Spader's then-wife was one of the people who decorated the set.) Really, my only quibble is that we never find out what Ann does in the job she ends up with. Does she, perhaps, recycle the garbage that allegedly concerned her when she was a rather desperate housewife? I would like to think that the job meant more than just a pay cheque, and maybe it does.That is such a tiny point. Spader and San Giacomo are both, in my opinion, very sexy in this film, and that would be reason enough to watch it over and over again.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

74,SandyLiz,What I think,10,21 April 2006,"I finally saw the movie after hearing about it a long time ago! It was on TV, IFC. I think James Spader is a magnificent actor--still is on Boston Legal. I didn't ""understand"" the movie right after I saw it. It had to sink in first. I think the key is the title...it's about sex AND lies and the videotape of course. But the most important part is observing these four people and determining for yourself which are lies and which are not lies. I thought at first maybe Graham was in love with John in college and that's why he came there to haunt him. But NO that's not it. Near the end, Graham tells Annie that he is a pathological liar. I was married to a pathological liar and one of his kids is also one. They just lie to lie, even when the truth is no trouble at all. They would rather lie. (The make good compulsive gamblers, too.) And is Graham's statement (being pathological liar) also a lie, too? What else was a lie? I think (and I may be wrong or may change my mind) that Graham knew that John had had sex back in the old days with Elizabeth and he came to town to get revenge on John -- because John was basically a ""successful"" lawyer, and also a liar and a cheater...etc. He came to expose him for being the cad he knew John was underneath his proper lifestyle. So Graham came back to muck up John's life and he also came to have sex with John's wife. I think the impotence was a lie, and he set it up to get Annie to willingly offer to have sex with him. I think he achieved his goal. I don't think he was planning to get romantically involved and stay in town after the end of the movie. He was vindicated, maybe at his own cost. But he brought everybody down, didn't he? The characters hurt each other/helped each other and basically changed their lives by bouncing off of each other. AND, did you see in the bar when Annie came to give her sister Charlotte a birthday gift (after she was divorced from John at the end?) She was wearing the pearl earring of Charlotte's that she found in the bedroom. Perhaps to remind her not to fall for lies anymore from anyone in the future? Did you notice the pay of black and white in the houses, walls and clothes of everyone and also addition of reds and pinks? This was an important part of the movie. AND my gosh, was James Spader good-looking and sexy back then? Yum. He's so great in Boston Legal.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

He may be social outcast but his feelings are so genuine that can deviate the route of routine. True love and affection is the outcome of this peculiar human adventure. More than love, affection and tenderness. The moment that Ann removes the camera and comes close to Graham is one of the most heartwarming in the story of cinema.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
76,davidec23,Didn't live up to the expectations,6,5 April 2013,"I heard a great deal about this movie from some of my friends and having seen some of Soderbergh's more recent works, I must say I was kind of let down. The story in itself is kind of interesting but the characters (and the actors) aren't. Most of the characters felt superficial to me ie. the successful lawyer having an affair, cheating sister, repressed wife etc. I just think Soderbergh should have built the characters a little more. Other than that it is quite a decent film. Especially the different perspectives this film gives you on infidelity and dishonesty (and fetishes I guess). Not a movie I would watch again though... I'll just stick to Soderbergh more recent work (Traffic was brilliant).","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
77,evetston,Revisited,8,24 May 2016,"I watched this movie for a second time this evening, the first being at least 25 years ago. I had forgotten the details of the story, and I didn't find myself trying to fill in the blanks like I sometimes do when memories are revisited in an extended session (whatever the running time of the film). It impressed me that I simply wanted to watch the performances and experience the flow of the film. I think it has aged remarkably well. Some of that is due to the acting, which is really quite good, but there's also not much of the story that is rooted in time. If anything, having such video footage is probably more commonplace today.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
78,judithturner-50577,Steven Soderberg's foray into cinema is a work of art.,7,12 August 2018,"Sex, Lies and Videotapes took the film world by storm on release- It won the top prize at the Cannes film festival that year and shot Steven Soderberg to fame and glory- and to be fair he deserved it. He's only grown better with each film, one of the true auteurs of the modern age of cinema. Special mention to James Spader who is excellent as the troubled lead. Every actor is exceptional and that is down to the director again. You should give this film if you like edgy independent films.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
79,orly-yahalom,"Sorry, not convinced",6,10 August 2010,"The film has some moments of interest and good acting, mainly by Andie MacDowell. However, all in all, I felt disappointment and boredom, which increased as the movie progressed.The main idea in the movie is the dramatic change which the characters go through once Graham enters their lives. Well, I could not see anything about Graham that could drive such a change. Why is the introverted Ann suddenly opens up to this eccentric stranger? Why is her sister so keen to meet him, knowing basically nothing about him, and why does this meeting drive her to make a significant change in her life? As for the Graham character itself, by the end of the movie we still know little about him, which makes it a bit awkward when Ann confronts him about his life. However, I didn't feel any interest in knowing more about him. The same goes for the other characters. Cynthia has been particularly shallow and didn't seem to have any motive in her life except resenting her sister. I guess that the idea of talking about sex was sensational at the time, but now when it became trivial, we are left with a pretentious movie that gives little of what a good drama should.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
80,Robby-17,A personal favourite.,8,29 November 1999,"The first time I watched 'Sex, Lies and Videotape', I was amazed at how a film that was so lacking in sexual explicitness, could still be so erotic. I watch the film often and it still amazes me as to just how accurately it taps into the viewers conscience. The eerie music, that rings and whirrs throughout the movie is the subtlest focusing device I have ever seen in a movie. The way in which relationships are analysed and conversations that in any other screenwriters hands would have seemed clumsy, come to life on the screen in front of you. Never before or since has James Spader just seemed so right in a movie. While Andie Macdowell and Laura San Giacomo are both brilliant in their portrayals of the complex female siblings they are in this movie. Time often seems to melt away in this film, as the viewer becomes unsure of what is voyeuristic and what is merely the viewing of the film. Even in the small details, such as Spader's wardrobe - all black shirts and blue jeans; or Peter Gallagher's whiter than white suit at the end, even though we know what a liar he is. Even the comic value of the bum, who is constantly trying out cheesy chat-up lines at the bar where San Giacomo works, is spot on. All in all this movie is one that grows in stature, everytime it is viewed. A magnificent, candid masterpiece. Watch it, if you haven't already.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
81,cesetevi,one key theory,8,9 October 2018,"Four persons life somehow interconnected even if 9 years already passed.Graham's one key theory tells his all misery which is similar to Ann's life.Johns backstabbing rage ends up with Graham's Elizabeth who is all about what happened Graham through all those years. John is a kind of key to connect all those 3 people to tell their story. Soderberg dives deep in humans nature when Cynthia tells her perverse thrill when she wants to sleep at her sisters bed and again John's guilty regret when he tells Graham he had an affair with Elizabeth that he would not know this much damage would do to him. Graham's one key theory is Ann's unhappy marriage, this key is literally a key that tell unhappy story of those people. And guilt.Even Ann has that guilt which is lightly covered with lies, even if those lines are told to yourself. Soderbergs movies have always a dark side to human nature which we see all day around and that weird guy in the bar makes those conversations which are not dull at all. Sex is chosen because I guess it is most controversial and repressed issue which makes it darker and needless to say makes part of human nature.By the way videotaping or just recording is something you should try, even with talking to yourself or to someone else.It is revolutionary.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
82,CarBohm,A work of pure unadulterated Genius...Magnificent.,10,13 May 1999,This movie captures the human condition like no film ever made.  I was transfixed by the honesty of the characters as they maneuvered through the landmines of self hatred and deprivation.,"Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
83,wellgamertutos,"This film resembles the expression ""better than sex"".",10,27 September 2020,"The film itself is about sex and all its consequences as an instrument of pleasure, power, philosophical, etc. Here sex, be it the act or its simple verbalization, is the way for the self discovery of the four central characters, whether destroying or resuming social relations, sex is always the starting point for the development of the plot and the inhabitants of that particular world . What is striking is that in a movie about sex it is never explicit, which demonstrates the incredible genius of filmmaker Steven Soderbergh in his first feature ...
All the technical aspects were orchestrated in the right measure, music, editing, sound, they are all examples of how to do something subtle and powerful, the highlight being the light design, the first sight for anyone who doubts the capacity of the film's cinematography, because it is not an explosion of colors, but it is subtly grand, better than adjectives and remembering the scene in which the two sisters confront each other at a distance, one looks like an angel wrapped in peaceful white, while the other is in an infernal red environment, this is how to develop characters.It is worth mentioning the small cast, as everyone is stupendous and convincing in the role of people, that if under bad interpretations they would be false.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
84,AnnaBeth,Film Reflection,9,29 May 2002,"Was not sure what to expect.  I think Andie M and James S gave brilliant performances and one couldn't enjoy watching them more.  Andi as Ann did a great job of seeming lost yet strong.  Spader as Graham gave me the chills, he was so vulnerable, open, and endearing.  I loved how he refused to hide his true persona.  As for L. San Giacomo she was alright, worked well with the material she had, ditto for Gallagher as Jon.  See this first Sodebergh film and you won't be disappointed.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
85,catherine_stebbins,"An astounding achievement in writing, directing and acting in a film that feels just as fresh in 2010",10,22 July 2010,"Steven Soderbergh's debut feature from 1989 revolutionized the independent film movement making way for 1990's low-budget American film to flourish. It also won the Palme D'Or at the Cannes film festival. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the film is that it still feels as fresh today as it must have over 20 years ago. All of the performances feature actors at the top of their game with Andie McDowell and especially James Spader (who also took home the Best Actor Cannes prize playing against type) giving their best performances. The editing is incredible, condensing the different information we learn visually and audibly in a more effective manner. The characters are all really well fleshed out as well as their relationships. It manages to be about sex without showing any yet still maintaining the frankness any graphic sex would have achieved through its dialogue. The film uses a style that is more on the minimalist side of things with little music and a slow steady flow with only four major characters. It delves into the relationships between husband and wife, men and women, sisters' and more. While Steven Soderbergh has always stuck to his avant-garde tendencies with low-key projects in between the big budget ones, he should be writing a lot more than he does and experimenting with character driven material from his own hand more often. The interactions between everyone are carefully observed. The way he handles the climax of the film is ingenious. Traffic may be the more impressive achievement but this is easily my favorite Soderbergh film.www.cinemaenthusiast.com","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
86,praneethmendu,it is not about the plot,8,10 July 2014,"I believe my review should help u figure out if this is your kind of movie or not. This movie is known for being the first independent movie make it that big. All that asideCharacters are gooood, acting too, and the feel of the movie (photography, production....)is fresh. Really, even in '14 still good (stark). its minimal soundrack, sharp editing (often creative),sense of mystery is maintained, oh! and the dialogues!! they create the mood so well, thats their priority . For most part its a lot of charged but paced conversations that are subtle and lifelike. its not just that its a good movieoverall . But its not about the plot its more theme based.hope it helps.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
87,titanicflint,Yuppie garbage,2,24 January 2007,"It's films like this that give repulsive, self-centered yuppies a bad name! Pretentious, unfocused and boring it's beyond me how this film managed to get made in the first place. The fact that it managed to win all kinds of awards and even develop some kind of a cult following is even more baffling. For starters the plot(for lack of a better word) is totally incomprehensible, so I won't even go there. The characters are even worse. Not one of them is even half-way close to being sympathetic. A good psychiatrist wouldn't touch any of this crew with a 10-foot couch. Bluntly put they deserve each other. Nuff said. It was more than a decade after sitting through this before I would willingly watch an Andie McDowell movie. As for the rest of the cast well... I left the theater feeling that the filmmakers were having a big laugh at the audience's expense. Avoid this one like the plague! Unless you're having a bad case of insomnia.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
88,danmaskell,Excellent performances - absence of soundtrack adds to uniqueness,10,2 December 1998,"James Spader gives an excellent performance.  Much of the communication in the film is through body language, particularly the eyes.  The intensity with which Spader looks into the eyes of the other actors shows how the integrity of his character contrasts with the phoniness of the character played by Peter Gallagher.  I particularly like the effect created by an absence of a soundtrack.  Low-budget filmmaking at its finest.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
89,thepeej,Monumental Debut from Soderbergh,9,20 February 2002,"I owned Sex, Lies and Videotape for almost a month before I finally watched it and it has grown as one of my favorite movies.  There really isn't alot of great cinematography, but the actual plot, and the music is astoudingly perfect.Although some may find it a bit strange, or even threatening that our protagonist Graham must film the women he meets in order to achieve any sexual satisfaction...even those who don't agree with his ethics will find themselves cheering for him, and hoping that he can overcome his Problem. ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I've ever seen.  10","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
90,ghanti,"Exquisitely crafted, honest, minimalist and an almost perfect product",8,23 September 2008,"It is a film about relationships, dilemma, courage and more. What works in life and what does not. Honesty does and (crudely speaking) at a very basic level that is the message. At the very heart are the three protagonists who are stuck. The therapist is spectacularly wrong in his interpretation to the apparently frigid wife: 'If you think about it ...you are obsessed about things you have no control over'. But she demonstrates at the end that she did have the control. All she needed was a better, more 'intimate' therapist; a catalyst : Graham ; who ends up uncluttering the cheating sister in law's mind and forces the husband to confront his problems in the process. It is a remarkably optimistic film in its content and therefore perhaps slightly unrealistic.It is a film about masterful use of contrasts; the two women and the two men could not have been more opposite in every possible respect. In a way Graham is also a perfect contrast to the imperfect Psychoanalyst. This helps the director bring out the message clearly. The whole film is crafted in a minimalist way, flows smoothly and does not carry much 'garbage'! Music, camera and the narrative are almost perfect in that they are almost invisible. So are the actors, especially James Spader and to a large extent Andie MacDowell. Gallegher is probably less than perfect but very good nonetheless. Laura Giacomo portrays a rather difficult character really well. It treats the audience with respect as the message is subtle and very personal, as it should be. My only grievance is the last office scene involving Gallegher was probably unnecessary.Sex and the videotapes are incidental to the storey and perhaps misnomers therefore.It is like reading a rather well written short storey and I would recommend 'Days And Nights In The Forest' (perhaps slightly more realistic and understated than this film) by Satyajit Ray to those who have enjoyed this film.My rating 8/10.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
91,roger.nelson,Excellent film!,10,10 February 2001,"Once in a great while a motion picture comes along that surprises me. sex, lies, and videotape is one of them.  10-years had passed between the release of this picture and the time I saw it.  Then another 2-years before I decided to write about just how wonderful it is.  My only regret is that I didn't get to view it on the big screen.  My commentary on this film will be terse and the reason for this is I admired the film so much that I could go on-and-on about how really good it is.The first thing I noticed about the characters of Graham and Ann is that they are drawn to each other without realizing it.  During their first scene together, I could tell there was some attraction between them.  Ann is a sweet, innocent, very intelligent woman who is unfulfilled, yet doesn't realize her dilemma and is, therefore, in therapy.  At first I thought my instinct was wrong in this incidence, but came to realize how right I had been when Ann arose to go upstairs just to look at Graham sleeping. Neither of them have a clue as to what is transpiring between them, but their future together seems set and often that can be the best kind.Andie MacDowell is absolutely wonderful as Ann.  She owned that role.Graham is the character in search of closure to his past, which he regrets, probably due to his new-found moral code.  His attraction to Ann isn't evident to him because most men seeking a higher moral plane don't think of other men's wives in that regard.  Yet he openly discusses his impotence with her in a diner while the two of them are apartment-hunting for him. It's true that they are sharing secrets, but why something so personal a nature?  Ann tells Graham that she thinks sex is overrated and gives him her reasons why.  So, we have two comparative strangers, who had only met the day before, discussing things about their lives that they normally would keep to themselves and it is because they are comfortable with one-another and are still unaware of the deep-rooted attraction they share.James Spader is one of my favorite actors and turns in his usual outstanding performance.The character of Cynthia (Ann's sister) is the opposite of Ann.  She knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it, even though it's her sister's husband.  She doesn't want him on a permanent basis -- just when she needs him.  Sort of like a light switch that you can flip on and off.Good performance by Laura San Giacomo.The toughest character to write about is John.  Here is a guy on his way up the ladder of success who lets his hormones affect his job performance. He isn't entirely to blame, because he is in a loveless marriage and he doesn't realize the fact that he doesn't hold the key to Ann's heart.Good performance by Peter Gallagher.Mr. Soderbergh did an outstanding job of directing the four main characters to achieve the proper mix.  Without his superb direction this would have been just another film, but it is so much more than that.  I look forward to more of his writer-director creations, but sex, lies, and videotape will remain one of my all-time favorite films.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
92,ThatFilmDude42,"Sex, Lies and Videotape and a Review",5,21 October 2020,"Sex, Lies and Video tape is a 1989 film which directed by Steven Soderbergh. Other works of his Is; Behind the Candelabra, Contagion and Oceans Thirteen. Sex, Lies and Videotape tells the story of a relationship that has turned sour and how desire can drive you to dark places. The story follows a couple who is in a bad relationship as John the husband who is played by Peter Gallagher (The Underneath 1995) is cheating on his wife Ann played by Andie MacDowell (Groundhog Day 1993) Je is cheating on her with her sister Cynthia played by Laura San Giacomo (Pretty Woman 1990) . When Johns old friend shows up Graham played by James Spader (Avengers: Age of Ultron 2015) Graham is not as John remembered him and Graham has a dirty little secret of his own.The story is well crafted it adds in twists and turns to always keep you interested in the lives of these dysfunctional characters. The settings are smartly designed for each of the different characters and how they feel throughout the movie and as it progresses, they along with the characters change. The sound design was poorly executed in this movie because whenever a character was talking to another character on a phone the voice was sounding like it was coming out of the screen and not the phone. It was like there was no depth in any scene and to be honest it pulled me out of the movie experience to be honest.The editing was minimalistic it was just shot reverse shots. Which isn't bad and is normal for a drama that is basically a character study of relationships and how they can go wrong. But for me the build up was big but then just fell flat. In conclusion this is a slow burning movie with a great story and a satisfying end (despite the dissapointing closing) it has rich interesting characters and great dialogue.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
93,deepfreezevideo,Soderbergh's Debut is Strong,10,8 April 2005,"The average viewer might see this film expecting a salacious treat for the prurient interests but the disappointment disappears rather quickly when they realize that they are watching an expertly crafted (TRANSLATE: HUNGRY!) script turned into a compelling photo-play. Sex, Lies and Videotape takes marital infidelity and sibling rivalry and turns the mixture into dynamite, with one James Spader as the fuse. The tiny cast is rock solid and perfectly matched and the dialogue is efficient and witty. Indeed, there are some lines in this film which will make you either guffaw, get hot and bothered or both at the same time and the process is repeated throughout. Peter Gallagher and sultry Andie McDowell are the dysfunctional couple, with McDowell's character a delightful study in Southern Belle turned frigid neurotic. Add one sly, sultry and slutty kid sister played magnificently by the luscious Laura San Giacomo and the story quickly reaches critical mass when it becomes apparent that hubby and kid sis are getting a little on the sly because wifey spends her time obsessing about suburban minutae and recoiling from her husband's amorous advances. Spader is the old college buddy who arrives in town on a mission to regurgitate the mess that was his past love life which he now uses as the canvas for his self-analysis via a videotape fetish involving a parade of women from coast to coast.To say that he has ""an effect"" on the trio is more than an understatement!Sex, Lies and Videotape is a classic example on how to properly make ""a film"" tell a story. It is utterly without nudity or special effects and yet you will feel like you've been rode hard and put up wet after seeing it.See it with your best girl.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

I saw it an actually liked it. It seemed to me like a play with four main characters who just talk. I also saw it as a perverted love story. From the gist of it it is about a husband and wife John (Peter gallagher) and Ann (Andie Mcdowal?) who unsatisfied with their marriage, John is having an affair with Ann's Sister and Ann has never been sexually satisfied. Graham, John's old school chum comes to stay with them and Ann becomes interested in him and learns that he too has a sexual problem, he is impotent. She and the audience later learns that the only way he....gets on is by watching tapes of him asking women questions of their sexual history. After that everything unravels.For you to go see. SPOILER: But I liked that under all these weird circumstances they (ann and graham) find each other and eventually end up together and overcome those problems they had. I again, am very surprised on how good this film is. check plus for steven soderbergh.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"

99,Lieve-2,yuppie vs weirdo,9,4 May 1999,"It is really funny that James Spader, who has made a career of playing yuppie bastards, got an award for playing Graham, an anti-yuppie, a weirdo (the yuppie bastard here is played by Peter Gallagher, whose perfect performance is too often overlooked). This is Spader at his very best, as you never saw him before, if you had noticed him before, that is. Although, when you look back, Spader always seems to have given his characters a little freaky edge (something about his dreamy look, or his slow drawl); one of my favourite scenes in this film is the one in which Graham explains his one-key theory to his one-time buddy over dinner, and you sense that they have really nothing  in common any more. Graham stands next to Hippolyte's Girardot's character in Eric Rochant's ""Un monde sans pitié"" and J.P. Belmondo's character in Godard's ""A bout de souffle"" for me; even next to Holden Caulfield; he is unique and real; I just like him, and not just because of the sound his shoes make while he walks to the bathroom (false alarm) on his first visit to Ann.","Sex, Lies, and Videotape"
