0,TheLittleSongbird,"Daft admittedly, but great fun besides",8,22 March 2010,"If you are looking for a daft but entertaining film, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids fits that criteria like a glove. True, some parts are a little slow and sappy, and there are a lot of daft moments. Nonetheless, it is great fun, thanks to the in general fast pace, and the breeziness of the film. The camera work is well done, the soundtrack is pleasurable to the ears, I loved the clever animated opening credits sequence and there is a cheerful spirit here that have been absent in films like this(ie. Problem Child 2, Home Alone 4, Beethoven's 4th). The acting is not bad at all either, Rick Moranis especially is wonderfully nutty and likable as Wayne while Matt Frewer is hilarious as ""Big"" Russell"" Thompson. The kids do give appealing performances too, and the special effects are well above average. Overall this is a fun film, nothing groundbreaking or anything like that, but it did something right; it entertained me. 8/10 Bethany Cox","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
1,Leofwine_draca,Nostalgic family favourite,6,6 January 2013,"An amiable family adventure yarn from Disney. I usually make a point of avoiding anything and everything remotely associated with the studio, but I'll make an exception for this childhood favourite.The story is a simple, child-friendly spin on THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN, although the production it most readily brings to mind is that cult '60s TV show, LAND OF THE GIANTS, with its adventures involving giant-sized threats. Rick Moranis, a crazy inventor, accidentally shrinks his kids, who then have to try to make him realise what he's done.This movie adopts a straightforward action-adventure format in which a gang of children tackle a series of threats, mostly involving the family garden which turns into a gigantic, perilous jungle. The calibre of the special effects is strong and adds to the immersive experience. Huge bees, ants and scorpions are brought to splendid life with plenty of thrills and spills along the way.I've always been a fan of Rick Moranis, and his manic presence here is a solid plus. Kudos, too, to Matt Frewer as the put-upon neighbour. The kids fare less well, coming across as rather bratty rather than brave and intrepid, but nonetheless the film works well as a whole and serves as a fitting slice of '80s nostalgia.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
2,SnoopyStyle,sincere charming Disney family fun,8,12 April 2015,"Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is a hopeless inventor working on a new shrink ray. It's getting into the way of his marriage to Diane (Marcia Strassman). She's taking a break. His next door neighbor Big Russ Thompson (Matt Frewer) is annoyed. While all the adults are away, Ron Thompson hits a baseball knocking off the shrink ray. Little Russ Thompson forces Ron next door to apologize. Russ actually likes Amy Szalinski. The shrink ray miniaturizes all four kids. Then Wayne returns and sweeps everybody up. He throws the kids out into the yards before he realizes too late.The silly title hides a fun little family movie. It is a cheerful, joyful adventure. It's sincere. It's old fashion Disney and that's the charm of it. The special effects is charming and never gets too scary. It has a few thrills. There's even a giant cookie. The kids are not the greatest actors but that also has a charm of its own. Rick Moranis hones in his dorkiness. This is simple family fun.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
3,Hitchcoc,It's a Fun Hour and a Half,6,5 January 2017,"Rick Moranis is an absent minded inventor. He makes things that are harder to handle than the simple devices he tries to replace. He hopes to make the world easier to live in, but the clean up of his messes takes more time and effort than doing things the conventional way. I'm not spending much time on this because it was never intended as a work of art, but the special effects are good, the Cheerios scene is pretty cool, and we all know it will work out in the end. Moranis is the perfect Schmuck who always seems to stay positive no matter how bad things get. Remember his small but significant part in ""Ghostbusters."" His family always stands by him, no matter what. And his neighbors continue to see him as a nut. Oh well!","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
4,gavin6942,A Disney Blockbuster,7,18 August 2014,"The scientist father (Rick Moranis) of a teenage girl and boy accidentally shrinks his and two other neighborhood teens to the size of insects. Now the teens must fight diminutive dangers as the father searches for them.The project was originally brought to Disney Studios by Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna. Gordon was hired to direct the film and Yuzna to produce. The film was written as ""Teeny Weenies"" by Stuart Gordon, Ed Naha, and Brian Yuzna. Tom Schulman was later added as a screenwriter. Gordon originally prepped the film but had to drop out as director shortly before filming began due to illness. Joe Johnston, who was formerly known as the art director for George Lucas, was brought in to replace him for his directorial debut.One has to wonder what would happen if Gordon had been given the job and was able to follow through. His previous work was ""Re-Animator"" and ""From Beyond"", so it is not unusual he would write a science-gone-wrong story... but was he someone who could make it for kids? (Maybe. Or maybe it would have been nice to see a more mature view, as there are obviously scary elements.) Roger Ebert is rarely flat-out wrong, but this is one of those times, as he wrote, ""The special effects are all there, nicely in place, and the production values are sound, but the movie is dead in the water."" Other critics and the audience disagreed, making this one of Disney's biggest successes and most memorable films.Besides the film itself, the score from James Horner is quite remarkable. He came into some issues later on for borrowing elements from other music, but this remains among his most distinctive scores.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
5,lee_eisenberg,one way to remember kindergarten,7,19 April 2007,"I remember how during summer school between kindergarten and first grade, we would often watch ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" on video. It's the sort of thing that can easily appeal to kids, as family man/inventor Rick Moranis creates a machine that's supposed to make inanimate objects tiny, but a snafu makes the machine turn his kids and the neighbor's (Matt Frewer) kids tiny. So, most of the movie has the kids traveling through the now giant front yard trying to get back to the house and having many adventures, ranging from fun to weird to scary.Yeah, I guess that it's hokey family stuff. But it's still fairly fun to watch. Now that I think about it, the sprinkler rain scene was actually sort of sexy. When I watched ""Ghostbusters"", I was surprised that Sigourney Weaver's neighbor was the guy from this movie. Speaking of which, what ever became of Rick Moranis? All in all, pretty entertaining. Still, I can't believe that in summer, 1989, this movie out-grossed ""UHF"".","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
6,jboothmillard,"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids",7,20 June 2005,"From director Joe Johnston (Jumanji, Jurassic Park III), this used to be one of my favourite family films, and whenever I watch again it is still fun. Basically slightly mad, but completely lovable and clever father, Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is trying to invent a shrinking machine, and so far he has failed in making it work right. That is until next door's Ronald 'Ron' Thomson (Big's Jared Rushton) shot a baseball through the attic window, activating the machine, and when they go up there to get the ball, they (along with a chair and couch) are victim to the shrinking machine. The kids, Ron, his brother Russel (Thomas Wilson Brown), and of course the Szalinski kids, Amy (Amy O'Neill) and Nick (Robert Oliveri) are now a quarter of an inch tall, and thrown out in the trash to the end of the yard, they now have to find their way back to the house through the jungle of the long grass of the yard. Soon enough, Wayne, and wife Diane (Marcia Strassman), as well as the Thomson parents, Russell (Matt Frewer, aka Max Headroom) and Mae (Kristine Sutherland) are all getting worried where they are. The kids journey sees them facing everything now big for them, including dog pee rivers, bees, water drops from the grass sprayer, scorpions, a lawn mower, and much more. Eventually they make it to the house, and are back to normal size when the machine is fixed, so a good film with some good early development into what special effects can do, and Moranis is a lot of fun. It won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. It was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Very good!","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
7,ccthemovieman-1,"The Good & Bad Of 'Honey, I Shrunk The Kids'",7,6 October 2006,"BAD - In the first half of the film, the kids were annoying at times, picking on each other; the teen romance was slightly sappy, and all three fathers in the film were pictured as stupid nerds. That's PC bigotry. They never picture mothers like that, only the fathers.GOOD - At least those nerdy parents were loving parents who cared about their kids. And, at least they were together, unlike most Hollywood films in the past 35 years. The little kid with the glasses was neat. Some of the special effects were good. The sight of parents trying to find their kids in the backyard while suspended in the air was funny. Matt Frewer had a great line, while observing Rick Moranis: ""What a waste of skin!"" The film had a nice ending.OVERALL - Nothing super, but overall was an enjoyable, lighthearted, non- offensive movie.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
8,BA_Harrison,Backyard safari fun (but no David Bellamy).,7,17 January 2009,"Whilst watching Honey I Shrunk The Kids on DVD, it occurred to me how much things have changed in the last twenty years: records and typewriters, which feature in the film's opening animated credits, no longer exist ('what are they?', asked my bemused 7-year-old daughter); spectacles have got a lot smaller (the one's sported by the youngest kid in this film are enormous!); computers are now everyday household appliancesnot just the play-things of crazy inventors; telephones are a lot easier to use now they don't have cords; Rick Moranis is no longer a box-office draw; and special effects look a whole lot different now we have CGI (not necessarily better, just different).One thing that hasn't changed, though, is this film's ability to entertain: Joe Johnston's directorial debut is just as enjoyable today as it was when I first saw it two decades ago.Rick Moranis stars as crazy inventor Wayne Szalinski, whose latest creation, a miniaturisation ray, has one major teething problem: it tends to make things explode. After the machine is whacked by a stray baseball, it finally begins to function correctly, but accidentally shrinks Wayne's children, pretty blonde teen Amy (Amy O'Neill) and chip-off-the-old-block younger son Nick (Robert Oliveri), plus Russ and Ron, the neighbours' sons, to microscopic size. Oblivious to the fact that his machine is now working, and that it has miniaturised his kids, Wayne destroys his machine, sweeps up the pieces (scooping up the four tiny children in the process) and takes the trash to the bottom of the yard.Now, if they are to have any chance of being returned to normal size, Amy, Nick, Russ and Ron must make a dangerous trek through their yard, facing a variety of dangers on the way.Utilising detailed oversize props and sets, plus an impressive (for the time) combination of blue screen technology, matte paintings, and stop-motion animation effects, director Johnston creates a string of spectacular set-pieces that sees the children being bombarded by giant water droplets from the garden sprinkler, taking a flight on the back of a bee, being attacked by a scorpion, and befriending a baby ant. Johnston's younger cast members all give credible performances, whilst Moranis does what he does best: acts nerdy and looks worried a lot.Of course, this being a Disney movie, there is the obligatory happy ending, which sees Wayne finally perfecting his invention and returning the kids to full size. And this being a Disney film, everyone involved learns a valuable lesson in how to get along with others, despite their differences. Which is nice.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
9,paul_haakonsen,Wholehearted family fun...,7,29 December 2015,"I was initially settling on a rating of six stars out of ten, but upped it to seven because this movie is one of those movies that truly withstands the test of time. It was great family entertainment back in 1989, and it is still equally good today.The story in ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" has something for everyone in the family. It is about an inventor who has invented a shrinking ray device. And when his son and daughter along with the two neighbor boys are accidentally shrunk, they are on an adventure of big proportions in an attempt to cross their own backyard and get back to the lab.Taken into consideration that the movie is from 1989, then the effects are still okay for today. Of course not able to match the incredible CGI that we have in movies today. But back then it was fabulous, and it is still sufficient by today for what it was supposed to do.The cast in the movie was good, as it usually is in Walt Disney movies. Rick Moranis is, as always, great on the screen, as were Matt Frewer. But actually the whole cast were doing good jobs with their roles and characters.As mentioned earlier, this is a wholesome family movie. And if you haven't already seen it, you should take the time to sit down and watch it, especially if you have a younger child in the family.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
10,Coventry,"A Mighty childhood classic, forever in the heart!",8,24 May 2019,"There are a number of films, childhood favorites, that I will forever hold dearly in my heart because they were largely responsible for triggering my passion for cinema that still continues to expand today! Films like ""Dark Crystal"" and ""Return to Oz"" sparked my interest in fantasy universes. Movies like ""Watcher in the Woods"" and ""Something Wicked this Way Comes"" ignited my bizarre habit of always rooting for the most evil and villainous characters, and titles like ""Innerspace"" and this ""Honey, I shrunk the Kids"" opened up the fascinating world of special effects to me. Seeing this film again, a good twenty years since the last time and now in the company of my own 9-year-old son, literally fills me up with joy, especially because the majority of visual & special effects still solidly stand today!Only now I discovered an additional fact that pleases me. The original story came from Brian Yuzna and Stuart Gordon! The latter was even set to direct at one point, apparently. Both men rank amongst my favorite horror masters, and it's hard to imagine that the creators of gory and absurd 80s horror classics like ""Re-Animator"" and ""Society"" were also going to helm a Disney flick!Nobody could have been cast better than Rick Moranis as a batty scientist, Wayne Szalinski, who works in the attic of his typically suburban house on a revolutionary shrinking machine that never functions when it is supposed to. When the machine gets messed up by an incoming baseball, though, it suddenly does function, and it shrinks Szalinski's own offspring, as well as the two boys from next door, to the ridiculously small size of six millimeters! When they then get swept up and taken out in a garbage bag, the foursome is forced to find their way back to the house via the garden. But, of course, due to their size, a walk through the garden is the equivalent of a trek across the Amazon rainforest, with multiple lethal dangers and unforeseeable obstacles.""Honey, I shrunk the Kids"" contains a handful of wonderful and legendary scenes that I have never forgotten. There's the magical flight on the back of a bumblebee, the slow-motion fall into the giant flower, the insects' battle, the close encounter with the lawnmower and the deep-dive into a bowl of cereal. The F/X are still amazing enough to deeply impress my son (and kids nowadays are certainly used to high digital standards) and underlying morals regarding parenting and friendship are heart-warming whilst not being shoved down our throats like in other Disney flicks.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

12,Boba_Fett1138,A small adventure of grand proportions.,7,31 December 2007,"Basically this one great and fun adventure movie, for kids especially. It's a Disney movie, so it's most definitely kid orientated, which means that it doesn't have the most complicated script, drawn out characters, or other mind boggling elements but it more than serves its purpose.What is the most appealing aspect of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" are its adventures elements. It was a great move to let the movie for most part be set in the backyard of an ordinary house, of a not so ordinary family. The shrunken kids have to overcome all sorts of dangers in the backyard, such as 'giant' insects, water drops, muddy rivers, lawnmowers and of course avoid being squashed by humans. A new adventure and obstacle awaits at every corner, which makes sure that there is always something happening in the movie and makes things flow well.The movie is perhaps more adventurous and fun than really funny. The most comical aspects of the movie mostly come from the adult cast, from actors such as Rick Moranis and Marcia Strassman as the parents and Matt Frewer and Kristine Sutherland as the neighbors. They mostly make sure that the movie is a perfectly enough watchable and entertaining one for adults. Rick Moranis of course suits the role very well as a nutty scientist. He is perhaps also known best for his roles in the ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids""-movies than any other one.The movie is well made and Joe Johnston shows himself again a capable director. I have always liked him as a director. He never made any really great movies but his movies are always entertaining, which always make a Joe Johnston movie a pleasant one to watch. This movie was his directorial debut and he could had done a lot worse.The movie has some good effects, also especially considering the time it got made. The movie uses all kinds of effects. Mostly of course consisting out of over-sized sets and objects but also stop-motion effects, mechanical effects and some early special effects. Especially the over-sized objects aren't really convincing looking and are obviously made out of light and non-nature materials but I don't know, this seemed sort of right and a suiting style for a kids movie such as this one. The musical score by James Horner is also a perfectly fine one.About as good and entertaining as a kid's movie can get, though there is also plenty left to enjoy for adults.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
13,view_and_review,What a Fun Movie,8,24 December 2019,"Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an inventor who is tirelessly trying to create a shrink ray. He hasn't gotten past blowing up his targets when he quits for the day. While he's away at a conference one of the boys next door hits his baseball into Wayne's attic, activates the ray gun, blocks the laser from the ray gun, and shrinks the kids. From there it was an adventure only tiny people could have.I saw this as a kid and loved it. I always liked playing in the backyard and could only imagine playing in my backyard if it were a forest.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
14,FlashCallahan,Oh French class..... Tee hee.....,5,4 April 2013,"Wayne Szalinski is a scientist who invents a miniaturising machine so powerful it only blows things up. When the kid next door hits a baseball through the window and it lands in the path of the machine's laser, it begins working. Wayne's two kids plus the two kids next door end up becoming tiny. Wayne accidentally sweeps them up and puts them out with the garbage, so the kids then have to travel through the thick grass back to the house, while braving giant bugs, sprinklers and a lawn mower......This film is basically Jason and the Argonauts for little kiddies, and its a complete sell out that Moranis gets top billing, because he is nothing more than a special guest star in this event movie.And it really hasn't stood the test of time. The idea is sound, and some of the practical effects and sets are really amazing, but its so full of troupes, it just begs to be mocked.The competitive dad, Moranis being laughed out of a meeting, boy fancies girl next door, crazy comedy dog, and wise cracking youngster are all here and present.But it's bright and breezy and really doesn't bother the grey matter. I guess I'm not thirteen anymore, as it was perfunctory stuff then.It's ripe or a remake.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
15,Aaron1375,"I didn't like it, but I can't really say stay away from it.",3,16 October 2003,"In 1989 you knew Rick Moranis was going to be in one of the top movies of the summer, but most would probably have said that it was going to be Ghostbusters 2.  Well they were wrong it was this rather bad adventure movie for the kids.  That isn't entirely fair for me to say, it just did not work for me, but other kids may like it.  I was also 14 or 15 when I saw it so I just did not enjoy this family film.  First of all it came with a really bad Roger Rabbit short.  This was when they were still trying to make him into something, but that ended thankfully.  After that we are treated to a rather unfunny comedy adventure about an inventor who develops the most useless of inventions...the shrink ray.  Well I guess it does have some uses.  Well suffice to say Rick Moranis is the only person in the movie that got off a few lines I chuckled too, but other than that this movie is a pretty standard shrink movie.  Reminded me of the old TV show ""Land of the Giants"" I think it was called.  The kids end up outside thanks to some house cleaning and there is where some stupid things occur such as befriending of an ant and the deadly scorpion...an insect that isn't all that common in the back yard of most homes unless this movie took place in Arizona or somewhere else west.  There is also a bee ride and this makes up all the insects in the entire yard.  Just not very realistic and I am pretty sure you can't befriend an ant.  Like I said, I really did not care for this one, but it might be good for younger children so don't totally dismiss it.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
16,Mr-Fusion,Watch out for the guy with the giant laser in his attic,7,16 January 2017,"""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" was a childhood favorite. Between this and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", I'd gotten serious mileage out of the family VCR; which is why saying it still holds up is a genuine compliment (and this is a Disney movie; I tend to steer clear of those). But there's a lot about this that really works. It's a grandiose adventure (had to be fun designing those giant sets), the cast is great and it's got that well-engineered family movie feel to it. It's classic Disney, to me.Trivia has it that the Wayne Szalinski part was written for Chevy Chase, but he would've been best suited to the physical comedy rather than the absent-minded professor end of it. Rick Moranis proves an inspired choice for this; he nails both facets.7/10","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,I thought it was cute,6,30 March 2004,"I mean, it's nothing spectacular. But just a light hearted little comedy about a crazy scientist who is inventing a machine to shrink things. When he just about gives up on it, his kids and the next door neighbor's kids accidentally step into it's path, it works! They are shrunk. When Wayne, the scientist, thinks it's completely broken without knowing what it did the kids, he trashes the machine. When he cleans up the mess he made and accidentally throws the kids in the trash. They end up making a big journey through their back yard to get back home and be big again.
Over all, it's a good movie. Definatly worth a watch. 6/10","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
18,MovieAddict2016,Charming Late-Eighties Comedy...,8,3 December 2002,"Needless to say, the sequels were not.Rick ""Moran""is plays another wacky nerd, this time named Wayne Scalynsky. (probably spelled that wrong-sorry.) Wayne is an bumbling inventor, whose latest invention, a shrink-machine, proves a misfortune as the device accidentedly shrinks Wayne's poor kids, along with some neighbor's kids as well. You could accuse this film of being manipulative, but I found it charming and amusing, because it isn't often a shrink machine is based in a film, and when it is, that particular film is often a horrible example of filmmaking (The Incredible Shrinking Woman).So if you feel like a good escapism comedy, watch Honey I Shrunk the Kids-the title alone causes you to emit a giggle. 3/5 stars-JOHN ULMER","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
19,OllieSuave-007,An adorable kid adventure for the entire audience.,7,25 July 2014,"This is an adorable kid adventure that is fit for the entire audience; a story about absent-minded scientist Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) accidentally shrinking his kids and his neighbors' kids to microscopic sizes with his shrinking machine. What results is a wild adventure as the kids must navigate through the now humongous everyday items like household objects, toys, garden tools and insects to get Szalinski's attention to restore them back to size.It is an amusing plot device to see the usual everyday stuff like a lawnmower, tools, Lego toys and cereal bowls become huge obstacles and used for new purposes for the shrunken kids (i.e., using a Lego toy as a couch). All these epic proportion objects are highlighted in some great and believable special effects, especially the kids befriending an ant and one of the kids hitching a ride on a bee. The kids trying to escape a lawnmower in the yard is also an exciting scene.Moranis is likable as Szalinski and Marcia Strassman is zany as his wife, Diane. The young actors who portrayed the shrunken kids did a decent job and don't try to be too childish, though, the filmmakers should have left out ***spoiler ahead*** the sappy little romantic fling between the two teenagers, which I didn't think was necessary. In addition, the filmmakers should have left out the Scorpian vs. Ant scene, which I thought was too intense and depressing for a children's movie as it really brought down the mood of the film. ***spoiler ends*** Overall, it is a mostly entertaining film from start to finish, but the story does drag a little towards the middle and does lack some action. I've seen family films with more adventures and fun, but this is a typical, innocent and feel-food Disney movie that people should see at least once.Grade B-","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

22,A_Different_Drummer,Comfy as a pair of old slippers...,9,10 December 2013,"What the other reviews do not mention is one salient point. The film works. It starts up like an old reliable VW Bug and just keeps going. If you think that is easy, try to remember how many films you have seen where you were looking at your watch by the 30 minute mark. The key is the chemistry between Rick Moranis and Marcia Strassman, both under-used actors, both used to perfection in this vehicle. The child actors were great, but what fun would this be without Moranis, cool in the face of difficulty, methodically searching every inch of grass on his lawn trying to find his kids...? And selling it -- you could actually believe that this guy felt he had everything under control. And Strassman, of WELCOME BACK KOTTER fame, is just under-used, period. The film is sit-back-and-enjoy it fun. No special awards. No special buzz (except for the spinoffs, which were never as good). Just entertainment. What more do you want?","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
23,Bored_Dragon,"If you liked ""The Goonies""",7,19 October 2020,"A goofy inventor accidentally shrinks his two and two neighbor teenagers to the size of insects, and then throws them out with the garbage in front of the yard. Our miniature heroes now have to return through the front yard, which from their perspective is a wild jungle that stretches for miles, and small everyday things that we usually don't even notice are now insurmountable obstacles to returning to the security of the home.As a kid, I loved this movie, so I decided to rewatch it with my family, and I have to say that it didn't age badly at all and that I really enjoyed it. This amusing SF adventure has diverse, quite well-built characters, an interesting story with subtle life lessons, a good pace that does not slow down for a moment, and effects that took your breath away in the eighties, and even today have not lost much of credibility. This is a children's movie in every respect, but I warmly recommend it to all ages, especially for family viewing with kids.7,5/10","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
24,ironhorse_iv,Size Does Matter. I like this intense little movie. It's a lot of fun!,7,30 April 2016,"This movie is a great family-friendly adventure film that deserves another big look. Directed by Joe Johnston, this live-action Disney film tells the story of four kids, Nick Szalinski (Robert Oliveri), Amy Szalinski (Amy O'Neill), Russ Thompson (Thomas Wilson Brown) & Ron Thompson (Jared Rushton) whom, are accidentally shrunk to the size of bugs by Nick's father, Walter Szalinski (Rick Moranis)'s inventions. Being mistaken for trash, they must journey from the trash can on the curb of the street, through the backyard of Nick's house to reach their parents, so that they can bring them back to normal. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I know, a lot of critics back in the day, has criticize, this movie for being too violence and intense, but as a kid of the 1990s, I found this film to be, very entertaining. After all, I found films with children fighting for survival, realistic, and ballsy. This movie doesn't sugar-coated the action at all. I'm still mourning the death of the Ant from this film. The backyard of your house is indeed a jungle full of danger. I love all the little action set pieces, ranging from animal attacks like vicious-looking scorpion, loud-buzzing honey bee to man-made items like nearly drown by a Water Sprinkler, or getting nearly slice in half by a lawnmower. While, this movie was originally written to appeal to more child demographic called 'Teeny Weenies' by screenwriters, Stuart Gordon, Ed Naha, Tom Schulman & Brian Yuzna, the film tone was change, to appeal to a more mature audience, after kids films like 1984's 'Gremlins' & 1988's 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' became a big hit, due to its amazing visual effects. Due to this, Joe Johnston was brought in to replace the original director, due to his design and special effects background. In my opinion, this movie wouldn't had work, without him. The great set pieces and practical effects really made this movie, wonderful to see. Heavily influenced by 1957's 'The Incredible Shrinking Man'. The use of rear projection, forced perspective, split screen and model effects all help convey the children's dwindling size. It was all very remarkable at the time, even if some of the visuals look a bit dated now. Even the cartoon opening sequence was pretty cool. The title coming down on the cartoon characters with some simple 3D effects was impressive at the time. The music that went along with the film is outstanding. Inspired by the music work by composer, Raymond Scott, composer James Horner added some really needed speed to the original music, 'Powerhouse' to make a new genius and genuinely special brand of intensive. However, since Horner didn't pay royalties or providing attribution to the original song, Scott's estate threatened to sue Disney after the movie was released. After prolonged negotiation, they settled. While the on-screen credits were not changed, cue sheets for the movie do note the use of Scott's piece. Another fun fact about this film, is the fact that the animated short 1989's 'Tummy Trouble' was released theatrically with this movie. Many credit the success of this film towards audiences wanting to see more of Roger Rabbit. Although, for me, personally, I came to want to see this movie for Rick Moranis. I really hope, that he returns back to acting, one day. He's greatly missed. His acting in this film was amazing. He really capture that nerdy, misunderstood inventor father feel. Even the supporting actors that played the other parents, weren't that bad. Matt Frewler as Walter's redneck neighbor, Russ Thompson Sr. was lot of fun. Much of the humor of the film, comes with the relationship between Russ and Walter. I like watching two polar opposites trying to work together for a common ground. The child actors that played the children in the film, were alright for the most part, too. I kinda like, that each character had a part to play in the kids surviving their own ordeal. Still, there is one thing that particularly bugs me about the shrinking effects. The kids' sizes are portrayed inconsistently. They are sometimes bigger than ant, and other times, smaller than them. It's a bit jarring, to watch, as there seem to be no sense of scale. Another thing that got me puzzle is how the machine honestly works. Let's say, that it works by sucking empty space out of a given object, but leaving its mass unchanged, as the main character says. If you were to shrink, down, wouldn't you end up with weight that you have in normal size, similar to 2015's 'Ant Man'? So, how are they able to be sweep up, in the beginning of the film? Similarly, how are they able to breath or digest food? The air would be too thin. I know, the movie isn't supposed to be science accuracy, but it's somewhat noticeable, but I'm willing to look past that. This movie is indeed a bit nostalgia for me, so I might be a littles bias. However, I do see some of the film's faults, but it's nowhere near as bad as other critics make it out to be. The several follow-ups are much, much worst. 1992's 'Honey, I Blew up the Kid' was mediocre at best. 1994's 'Honey, I Shrunk the Audience' was a surprise hit 3D video ride when it opened at Walt Disney World's Epcot Park in 1994, running until 2010 there. However, it did get somewhat dated toward the late 1990s, with the kids actors outgrowing their kid couther parts. Last, but not least, 1997's live-action direct-to-video 'Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves' was very forgettable. Another thing, the whole running gag with Diane Szalinski (Marcia Strassman) fainting in each movie is a little harder to watch now, since the actress death in 2014. Despite that; overall: the first movie was pretty good, but it was a little short for great. Still, it's worth checking out if you got the time. So go see it!","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

The likable cast is headed by Rick Morranis as the inventor Dad, Marcia Strassman as the Real Estate Mom and Amy O'Neill as the popular teenage daughter. Matt Frewer and Kristine Sutherland are the neighbours whose kids are shrunk along with Morranis's kids.The story is filled with the standard elements, the feuding neighbours, the next door neighbour boy who has a crush on the daughter, the intelligent son who is bullied by the neighbours kid, the workaholic parents who learn the error of their ways and of course the happy ending but the movie is anything but standard.Some of the special effects are a bit dated, but that does not stop your enjoyment of it!!

Well, you've come to the right movie!For a basic plot summary, ""Honey, I Shrunk The Kids"" begins with eccentric inventor Way Selinsky (Rick Moranis) crafting a machine to shrink objects to minuscule proportions. After an unfortunate baseball-through-the-window accident, the two Selinsky children (and two neighbor pals) are shrunk down and thrown out with the trash. The rest of the film focuses on their quest back home through a grass jungle, swarms of bees, giant ants, and the dreaded lawnmower.There are few movies that can be enjoyed by both old and young simultaneously. Usually, the jokes either use childish situations as a conduit to adult humor, or pander to the kiddies with enough syrupy sap to make adults nearly wretch. Fortunately, this film succeeds in both areas. The characters and drama are children fare, but the crazy adventures and touch of heart are enough to keep seasoned viewers tuned in for the duration.Is this little adventure flick an all-time family classic? Not necessarily...I don't know if anything starring Moranis truly can be. What it is, however, is a fun, quirky, 93-minutes filled with laughs, thrills, and even a bit of emotion thrown in. Avoid the sub-par sequels, but at least give this one a look for its originality and spectacle.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

This is one of them. It is a rather entertaining family comedy where a very distracted scientist creates a machine that, inadvertently, shrinks his children until they are smaller than ants. Of course Disney is behind this idea. The lead role is the scientist, Wayne Szalinski. Played by Rick Moranis (who played an unforgettable role in ""Ghostbusters""), he's basically a super-stereotypical goofy nerd. In fact, the whole movie is loaded with preconceived ideas, but this is not bad since this is a comedy and the idea is to laugh. And the film succeeds in that very easily, without recourse to easy jokes. It's not a brilliant movie, it's far from a good movie, but entertain, it's great to watch with the whole family on a weekend or holiday. And that's what matters here.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

This is unusual for me to say, as I watch movies over and over, but for me, this one loses its charm after the initial viewing.Otherwise, the child stars were competent; not talented, but competent, in their roles. This is not an example of talented child actors, beautiful sets, great story, etc. Basically, this is a modernized remake of the absent-minded professor, without Flubber, enigmatic characters, great writing, ingenious story, compelling dialog, or even benefit of talented thespians. The one great thing about this work was Rick Moranis, but you got too little of him and too much of the stiff, cardboard-cut-out kids.I was disappointed.

It has enough in the way of adventure and fun to appeal to all age groups, and it knows how to keep things clean without dumbing them down... and that is something that a lot of family films do NOT know how to do.It has enough where, the only people that don't like it are the people that need everything deadly serious, and they aren't going to like much","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

While the kids are having their miniature adventures the film can be a lot of fun, but it spends too much time in the full-sized world and takes too many breaks from the action to peddle its message about parental neglect. Some ingenious effects (director Joe Johnston is a former ILM technician) and a young cast pulled straight from the Sherman Oaks Galleria make the film a perfect summer diversion for idle kids with short attention spans. And, as an added attraction, it was preceded by an all new Roger Rabbit/Baby Herman cartoon, 'Tummy Trouble': seven minutes of nonstop mayhem which, for fans of old Warner Bros. classics, will only reinforce the sad truth that nostalgia isn't what it used to be.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
34,CubsandCulture,Cromulent family entertainment-but nothing more,7,26 December 2020,"I use to really like this film as a kid but re-watching it the other day took a lot of the nostalgia shine off the film. The effects haven't aged all that well but they lack the charm of creaky, dated effects work ala Clash of the Titans (1981) or The Thief of Bagdad (1940). The effects are caught between being too well realized to be campy and being to obvious too work as photo-real. The mixture of stop-motion and animatronic sticks out badly. In a film that is a effects spectacle that is a big problem.Fortunately the film does have some virtues remaining. The story is quite streamlined and there's no cloying fat present. The moralistic messaging is kept to a minimum. And the kid actors are pretty good as far as those sort of performances go. The film's humor still lands pretty well. All things considered this is a fine way to waste a rainy afternoon.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

Time would strip the joy from this and leave me with the desecrated husk of my childhood.Imagine my delight when I found this movie totally holds up. It's funny and moving.

Part of that is that it's what establishes all the characters as everyday people in an extraordinary situation: I wouldn't remove a single one as the main story interrupts them causes relatable, redeemable characters.The practical effects were top at the time and I dare say they (while dated) are better than some CG effects we see on 2020. They're believable, they're detailed and the actors can play off of what they can see and touch instead of just make believe.There are certainly a lot of faults, but watching this reminds of the quality we used to have in our movies that we now replace with explosions.If you like ""Goonies"", ""Ant-Man"", or ""Jurassic Park"", then definitely give this a try.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
38,Beta_Gallinger,"Not to sound cliché, butmeh",5,3 August 2009,"At the time of this movie's release, I was just under three years old, so I didn't hear of it until a few years later. In the early primary grades, I remember seeing it at an assembly in the gym. That was when I was introduced to it. I guess I saw the entire film, even though I could only remember little bits of it. I wasn't familiar with anyone in the cast at the time, but in recent years, I've become familiar with Rick Moranis, a comedian who played various roles in the Canadian sketch comedy series, ""SCTV"", as well as roles in several movies, including this one. Finally renting ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" the other day, I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but was hoping for a mildly amusing film (at least mildly amusing thanks to Moranis in the starring role). Sadly, I didn't even get that.Wayne Szalinski is an eccentric scientist with a wife named Diane and two kids, Amy and Nick. Russ Thompson, Sr. and his wife, Mae, live next door with their sons, Russ Jr. and Ron. Wayne has invented a machine which is supposed to be able to shrink objects (or living beings) significantly, but it doesn't work. Instead of shrinking things, it blows them up! However, one day, while the scientist isn't home, Ron Thompson accidentally knocks a baseball through the attic window of the Szalinski house and it lands on Wayne's machine up there! When the two Thompson brothers are sent up there to get the ball, they are zapped by the machine, which has been activated by the baseball, and now actually works. Both the Szalinski and Thompson siblings are shrunk, and when Wayne comes back up there, he accidentally sweeps them up and puts them out in the garbage! They manage to escape from the bag, and find themselves in the grass. With the kids missing, Wayne eventually realizes what has happened, and goes to look for them on the lawn. While he does so, the four find themselves in various types of danger, including insects, which are now giant to them! When it comes to humour, I've seen much worse than what I saw in this movie, but I still kept a perfectly straight face for the most part. I barely laughed or smiled at all. (I'm not sure if I ever actually laughed, and if so, it was very slight.) Wayne Szalinski, played by Moranis, did tickle my funny bone a little around the beginning, and so did the Szalinski son, Nick, played by Robert Oliveri. I was hoping it would improve along the way and get funnier, but it didn't. The scenes with Wayne and eventually Diane searching for the kids on the lawn while suspended in harnesses are supposed to be funny, but they failed to amuse me, just like most of the other gags. The lack of humour isn't this movie's only problem. None of the characters really stood out for me, and I was also indifferent to the plot. A film like this is obviously going to have a rather simple plot, but to me, it seemed even simpler than usual here. If the film were actually funny, it would be able to make up for that, but I'm afraid that's not the case.""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" was a commercial success. It spawned more than one sequel, and even a TV show. Less popular family movies have been made, but despite this one's success, there are definitely more appealing ones out there. Clearly, some people like this film, but I personally didn't find anything in it to keep me overly entertained. For that reason, I obviously don't intend to watch the sequels or TV show, none of which are as popular as this original movie. However, I'm not saying this 1989 family flick should be avoided by everyone. I'm sure it can be very entertaining for kids, even though I couldn't remember much of it from my childhood. I would suggest adults skip it, but I guess many would disagree with that, so I don't know. Maybe it's also good for parents to watch with their kids. It is lighthearted, innocent family fare, so I can at least give it credit for that, but compared to ""The AbsentMinded Professor"", an earlier Disney film about an eccentric scientist, it's fairly weak.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
39,vip_ebriega,An imaginative Disney comedy with a welcome old-fashioned feel.,7,15 February 2007,"My Take: A fine family entertainment with some neat special effects. I grew up watching and enjoying this funny, fast-paced fantasy adventure. But when I watched it back then, I always seemed to start it on the part with the scorpion and the ant, so I only watch a few parts. But I finally found it on DVD and watched it from the beginning. And I really enjoyed it. It's really a fantastic fantasy, with elaborate special-effects and lavish ""enlarged"" sets.The film is quite like the fantasy films filmmaker Steven Spielberg produced, like ""Back to the Future"" and ""Innerspace"" for instance. It depicts the adventures of average people, thrust into an adventure of a lifetime, and then must find away to get back safely. That's kinda like the premise of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"", a group of neighborhood kids get shrunk to size by a weird machine crazy inventor Rick Moranis invented. Disney triumphs in creating an enjoyable fantasy that's sure to be a charm. The stop-motion effects are still impressive, even if special effects in the 80's have certainly moved on. It's one of the best live-action Disney efforts and a fine fun for the entire family.This film is followed by a sequel ""Honey, I Blew up the Kid"", which is not quite as zany and imaginative as its predecessor.

40,DarthBill,Fond memories of those summer days when it was too hot to go outside,9,9 April 2004,"Leave it to Disney to give us a friendly mad scientist in the form of Rick Moranis, who plays an affable, amiable absent minded professor family man by name of Wayne who's latest invention, kept in the attic, is designed to shrink things down. Alas, he's not having much luck with it, as his initial test subject, an apple, gets blown up. Later, one of his neighbor's sons, Ron, hits a baseball through Wayne's window while he's out at giving a science presentation and when Ron's older brother Russ sends him to fetch it with Wayne's son Nick they get shrunk thanks to the baseball whacking the machine. When Russ goes up with Nick's older sister Amy they get shrunk too, along with a chair and Wayne's thinking couch. Unfortunately, a frustrated Wayne, unaware of what's happened, comes home and demolishes his machine and accidentally throws out his kids and his neighbor's (Matt Frewer of TV's Max Headrome fame) with the garbage. It is not until Wayne starts cleaning up the attic that he discovers the shrunken couch and chair (which he steps on) and realizes that his missing kids were shrunk by it and that he threw them out with the trash. So while Wayne embarks on a series of unsuccessful attempts to find his kids without stepping on them, the kids must make a dangerous trek through the uncut back yard, encountering ""giant"" toys, food, bees, ants, lawnmowers and, strangely enough, a scorpion (someone's escaped pet?).Good fun, and a lot less cynical than a lot of today's youth oriented adventure films. And of course, the message of family values and how it's important for dads to understand their kids in addition to spending time with them, is also present, but never overly preachy.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

43,Atreyu_II,A very strange adventure/comedy motion picture,7,1 March 2008,"""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" is a quite unusual adventure/comedy film, one of the most eccentric movies of all time. It's one of those live-actions films produced by Disney's studios.The movie's title refers to Wayne Szalinski, a stereotypical nutty/mad scientist. He invents a machine with the ability of shrinking objects to a size even smaller than ants. This character is portrayed by Rick Moranis, the perfect actor for a role like this (with his intellectual looks).Rick Moranis is funny as Wayne Szalinski, Matt Frewer is hilarious as the impatient and temperamental ""Big"" Russell Thompson. The kids also do a good job: Thomas Wilson Brown as the clever ""Little"" Russell Thompson, Jared Rushton as the paranoid Ron Thompson and Robert Oliveri as the nerd Nick Szalinski. One of the funniest parts for me is when ""little"" Russell forces his brother Ron to confess that he broke Szalinski's window with his baseball.The Szalinski kids (Nick and Amy) and the Thompson kids (""Little"" Russell and Ron, the Szalinski's neighbors) are accidentally shrunk by the machine and thrown into the garbage by accident. Because they are so tiny, they live a big adventure full of dangers and nightmares (from insects to a remote-controlled lawn mower) until reaching their house, something which would only take seconds on their normal size.The story becomes a bit odd and of a somehow discussable taste, but it also makes the difference... for good and for bad. However, I must be fair: at least this is a thousand times better than those stupid ""Problem Child"" movies. Not that they have anything in common, but... Overall, nothing extraordinary, but amusing, hilarious, great fun, entertaining, original, bizarre and with some funny lines («French class» is just one among many others).

Along the way, they meet up with giant insects and learn how to stick together to help each other out of the situation. The scale of the sets were amazing. (They meet a large ant, fly on the backs of bees, eat from a giant cookie, and see giant Lego toys lost in their front yard.) It's an innocent film made just for children, and it does capture the essence of the typical Disney film.

Strong in delivering memorable sequences even if everything is skin-deep and dated; however, for a 1989 film, the reality sets and effects are top-notch. Moranis is perfect as the goofy struggling inventor—a role originally offered to Chevy Chase and John Candy, the latter of which recommended Moranis—while Frewer and Sutherland are quite likable in their supporting roles as the neighbors. The four shrunken kids all deliver well enough, but never seem to get fully fleshed out; and Strassman, unfortunately, has very little to do at all.

48,Min111,An adventure in the backyard,7,8 October 2018,"I remember Honey, I Shrunk the Kids very well. I seen it on video tape, and I would always play it back to myself. It's the best movie of the series. It almost felt like you were part of their adventure (in the backyard by the way) too. That's where the fun starts unless you're those kids. There were four them. They also happen to be next-door neighbours. They don't usually get along. Two of the children's names are Amy and Nick. Their father happens to be an inventor and scientist. The father's name is Wayne. The mother's name is Diane who happens to be sweet. The other two children's names are Ron and Russ. Their parents names are Mae and Russ. They're the Thompson's. The story is simple. One of the kids, Ron, accidentally hits his baseball, and smashes it into the window. The baseball lands on the dangerous machine, and causes the machine to activate and work. The children are shrunk by the machine, and suddenly find themselves at the backyard along with the trash. It was an accident. Can they find their way home? Can they turn back to normal? You need to see it to find out. This is where their adventure starts - out into the backyard. It's a challenge to get back home for these kids. I like the boy - Nick. He's smart, and he looks just like his dad. Amy and Nick quickly become friends with Ron and Russ during their journey. They realise they have to work together in this if they're going to make it home. The kids also became friends with an ant they met during their journey. I thought it was cute. It was sort of like a pet. I was upset what happened to the ant afterwards. It didn't have to be like that, and I feel that was a mistake from the producers. Wayne, later, discovers that his couch has been shrunk, and soon finds out that his machine finally works. He's happy, but it was short lived because he now knows what happened to his kids. He, along with his wife, Diane, sets out to find them. Let's not forget the dog called Quark who plays a big role towards the end. I like that adorable dog by the way. I like the part where the kids find a Lego block in the backyard to camp for the evening. However, they get into trouble, but you have to see the movie to find out what trouble they're in. I can't believe how small they actually were. There's no way someone such as Wayne could see them even with those glasses. I also like the part towards the end where Wayne was having his bowl of Cheerios. It's an adventure movie. It's a comedy movie. It's a family movie. I don't know if it's exactly a Christmas movie, but the movie feels and looks better to watch during Christmas. There also happen to be two sequels which followed this movie. It's an adventure out into the backyard.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

50,jhaggardjr,Wildly entertaining Disney picture,9,3 March 2002,"""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" opened in theaters back on June 23, 1989. This was exactly the same day the first ""Batman"" movie opened. While ""Batman"" exploded to an opening weekend record (at that time), ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" opened in the #2 spot and it held its ground very well through the rest of the summer finishing as the surprise sleeper hit of the summer of 1989. And what a surprise this film turned out to be. ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" is a very funny, wildly entertaining comedy/fantasy about a nutty professor who's working on a device to make objects shrink. In the beginning, all this machine does is blow things into little pieces. But thanks to a little fate, the machine starts operating the way its supposed to, and four kids find themselves in the path of the machine. They are shrunk to the tiniest of sizes, end up being swept into garbage, and have to find their way back home by going through the backyard which to their point of view looks like a large jungle. ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" has alot of special effects. Some of the effects look good, other effects look really fake. If this movie had been made today the effects would have been more elaborate. But who cares if the effects look fake when the movie is so much fun. ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" is lots of fun. The performances are terrific. Rick Moranis is perfect as the nutty professor who has to find his two kids (as well as the two kids from next door) and fix up this mess. Marcia Strassman shines as Moranis's wife, and Matt Frewer is hysterical as Moranis's next door neighbor who's big plans for a weekend fishing trip go down the drain when his kids suddenly disappear (of course his two kids are two of the four kids that are shrunk). The four young actors playing the shrunk kids are all terrific, and the movie really belongs to them. Those kids are played by Amy O'Neill, Thomas Brown, Jared Rushton, and Robert Oliveri. Haven't seen much of them today, but they're all excellent in ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"". This is a Disney film that I could watch over and over again because it's so much fun. And I'm not a child. Kids should like it too. I don't think it's too scary even though there are a couple of scenes with the kids in perilous situations. Nevertheless, ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" is a movie for the whole family. Skip the two sequels ""Honey, I Blew Up the Kid"" and ""Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves"" as well as the TV series of the same name. They don't come close to matching this one for all out fun.***1/2 (out of four)","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
51,DavidSim240183,A wonderfully entertaining Disney film.,10,10 October 2004,"When it comes to Disney films, I normally find them trite and mawkish. There are only a handful of them I can watch. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is one of them. Its a film of tremendous assurance and confidence. And a terrific directorial debut from Joe Johnston.Inventor Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis), is one of those inventors you would find in a Rube Goldberg cartoon. In other words, he makes inventions that are supposed to run like clockwork, and half the time they usually don't.His latest invention is a machine that shrinks things down. But he hasn't figured out how to get it to work properly. When the Szalinski's neighbours, the Thompsons, accidentally break their attic window with a baseball, it activates the machine, and absorbs some of its power. Suddenly, the machine starts shrinking things, including the Szalinski's kids Amy and Nick, and the Thompson kids, Russ and Ron.Wayne unwittingly sweeps up the kids and puts the rubbish bag in the back garden. So begins the kids odyssey of trying to get back home through the jungle of their own garden. It is an uphill struggle to say the least, with the kids having to contend with dive-bombing bumblebees, killer scorpions, and runaway lawn mowers.I love the way Joe Johnston applies the connotation of a jungle to the Szalinski's overgrown garden. The blades of grass now resemble a rainforest, water sprinklers are like a thunderstorm to the kids, and the ants, bees and scorpions they encounter are like the local wildlife. This film is a great deal more clever and inventive than most Disney films.Its just one adventure after another, with our four heroes just trying to survive, and the adults trying to find a way to restore them to normal. Rick Moranis is likable enough as the befuddled scientist trying to straighten out the mess he's made. Marcia Strassman is great too as his wife, who has a nice chemistry with Rick Moranis.Matt Frewer and Kristine Sutherland add good support as the Thompsons. Matt Frewer gives one of his more endearing performances, and he's quite comical when he seems more interested in the state of the Szalinski's lawn then his own children. He is like one of those fathers out of a Jean Shepard novel, i.e. frequent camping trips, sticking to schedules, no understanding of his children at all, etc. Kristine Sutherland would eventually go on to find fame as Joyce Summers in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.The film is refreshingly clear of the over-sentimentality common with most Disney films. The only time when it does feel trite is when the kids befriend a baby ant, and it ends up being killed by a scorpion. I did think that was a bit unlikely that a scorpion would be in their garden, but that's only a minor fault. The fight between the scorpion and the ant is well done, and is fairly reminiscent of classic sci-fi creature films.There are many memorable scenes such as Nick and Russ riding a bee, the aforementioned ant-scorpion fight, and the kids caught in the middle of a storm caused by sprinklers. And who could forget the blackly humorous moment when Wayne almost devours Nick inside of his own breakfast cereal. Bit sadistic that for a Disney film!There's a nice sense of camaraderie and teamwork from the kids and the adults. I never get tired of this film. Its far superior to the sequels, consistently entertaining, fun, and quite lively too. Roger Ebert thought it had no fun, which just isn't true. Fortunately, he was proved wrong. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids was a huge success, grossing over 150 million dollars at the box office.A hugely enjoyable film, and one that both kids and adults can get a kick out of.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
52,roghache,"Ridiculous, cute, and fun family entertainment",8,14 April 2006,"This is a fun movie for the entire family. Well, of course, it's ridiculous but the kids will love it and you can laugh right along with them.The absurd tale revolves around around a nutty scientist & dad named Wayne Szalinski who is working on a machine to miniaturize objects. When his two kids plus their two neighbouring friends (the Thompsons) wander into his lab, Wayne inadvertently shrinks the four of them. Then he accidentally tosses them out in the garbage, so the poor kids have to brave the dangers of the lawn to get back to the house. And can the well intended but crazy scientist figure out how to bring the youngsters back to full size again? (Personally, my favourite aspect of the movie is the nutty father.)The story has plenty of adventure and danger as the teensy weensy younguns brave the perils of the jungle (actually their lawn). They face thunderstorm like risks of potentially drowning in the lawn sprinkler or being attacked by giant ants, bees, & other bugs. Not to mention the lawn mower!Avoid the TV series of the same name, but this movie has some good family messages involving the two sets of parents (the Szalinskis & the Thompsons) as well as the kids. And of course there's lots of hilarity and adventure. It should be rated higher than it is and fully deserved its popularity at the time. This film put the phrase 'Honey, I shrunk (or whatever) the kids' into people's everyday vocabulary!","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
53,DavidYZ,Very good sci-fi comedy film,8,23 April 2017,"This is a great family film about a scientist whose invention inadvertently miniaturises each of his two children and two neighbour kids to a quarter of an inch in height.

After all, it is Disney.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
56,Gubby-Allen,Not as good as I remember,6,13 January 2013,"Watched for first time in over 20 years. Not as good as I remembered - I certainly didn't recall it as being almost entirely about a trek from one side of the back garden to the other.It drags a lot in the middle but rushes the end, from when they are found it's all done in 10 minutes.You could also be quite pedantic on their sizes which didn't always correlate.Still good fun though and one of the better 80s or 90s family films and some amusing moments.About 5.5/10.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

58,reddragonhero17,small problem........GIGANTIC FUN!!!!!!!,10,2 March 2017,"There are some movies that stick with you throughout your life that has a special magic that has you coming back again and again, and this is one of them. I've known Rick Moranis since Ghostbusters and seeing him in this amplifies the magic wackiness this film possesses, but it doesn't stop there. As soon as the kids are shrunk, that's when the real fun begins. The special effects of the insects pay homage to the monster movies of the 50's, plus a little homage to Ray Harrryhausen's creatures with the battle between the Ant and Scorpion (the ant's death still gets me to this day). Finally add in a touching theme about the reality of parenting and this is one that stands the test of time.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
59,abrafocus,Really good!,8,9 March 2006,"Being a somewhat big fan of Rick Moranis, I had high expectations when I first saw this movie. I must say, I was not disappointed. The acting was terrific.***Spoilers*** Wayne Szalinski (Moranis) is a nutty scientist who invents strange things. One invention, a shrinking machine, just makes things blow up. At first. Then, a next door neighbor, Ron Thomson, (Jared Rushton) hits a baseball in Wayne Szalinski's lab- in the attic.Soon, four kids are the size of a grain of sand. Only a quarter inch tall, they make their way home. They have many adventures in the backyard, which is a jungle to them. The adventures include encounters with swarming bees, an ant, a lawn mower, and much more.After a near misadventure with a bowl of cereal, the kids are found. Wayne fixes his machine, and the kids are enlarged back to normal size.Later, both the Thomson's and Szalinski's are in the kitchen. On the table is a turkey the size of a piano.This is a well-made movie. It may be a little scary for some younger kids, but it is well worth watching more than once.My Score: 8/10","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
60,charlieoso,Nice Disney Family Fun,7,5 May 2020,"I remember when I was a kid a lot of the kids on our street went down to the local theatre and watched this on a Saturday afternoon when it was new. We seemed to really enjoy it and the crazy antics that happen.Rick Moranis plays super-nerd Wayne Szalinski who is working on his newest invention that can shrink things. After a baseball is hit into the upstairs window where the contraption is kept by the next door neighbour Ron (Jared Rushton) his older brother Russ (Thomas Wilson Brown) brings him over to apologize and get his ball back. When Wayne's two kids Amy (Amy O'Neill) and Nick (Robert Oliveri) bring the other two upstairs they find the machine is in perfect working order. They are shrunk right down to miniatures, end up in the trash can at the end of the driveway and must get back into the house and have Mr. Szalinski get them back to regular size.This film has some very cool effects and they were quite big at the time. Some of the effects still seem to work well due to the fact that a lot of them are in fact practical and director Joe Johnston did not rely on a computer to CGI up the effects. I mean it was 1989 so those effects were very primitive in today's standards, but that works for the film.I do think the kids should really enjoy this and my own wife loves it and it is one of her favourites. Also starring Matt Frewer as the Thompson boys' father Big Russ. Screenplay by Ed Naha and Tom Schulman. Based on a story by Naha, Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
61,superboy478,A Box Office Blast!,10,8 March 2002,"Honey I Shrunk the Kids is by far, one of the best movies Disney has produced. The special effects are incredible, the screeenplay is wild, and the directing is fabulous!When scientist Wayne Szalenski (Rick Moranis) fails to get his shrinking machine to work, he decides to retire from it. But, when the kid next door known as Ron Thompson (Jared Rushton) accidently hits his baseball into the Szalenskis attic window, it ends up giving the machine power to work that it ends up shrinking Waynes furniture up there. So, when Ron goes to the house to get his ball back, he and Wayne's son Nick (Robert Oliveri) end up going up there not knowing the machine is one and ready for fire, but, they end up getting shrunk to the size of ants.When Nick's sister Amy (Amy O' Neil) and Ron's brother Russel (Thomas Brown) go upstairs looking for them, they end up getting shrunk too! So when Wayne comes home, he destroys his machine, and cleans up the parts which ends up getting the kids put in the garbage! So now, the kids escape the garbage bag and end up falling in the backyard. They find out, that the only way they can get home is by going through the backyard!The Thompsons (Kristine Sutherland & Matt Frewer) become suspicious along with the Szalenskis. Because now, the kids are faced into incredible suspense with yard being like a jungle. The face lawn sprinklers, a giant lawn mower, a big bee, a gigantic scorpian, and Cherrios cereal.I don't want to spoil the rest.Directed by the Academy Award-winning Joe Johnston (Jumanji, Jurassic Park III) and starring Rick Moranis (Ghostbusters I & II), Marcia Strassman (Another Stakeout), Jared Rushton (House Arrest, Big, Pet Semetary II), Thomas Brown (Pearl Harbor), Robert Oliveri (Edward Scissorhands), Kristine Sutherland (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Matt Frewer (Supergirl).Honey I Shrunk the Kids is absolutley fun and awsome and is a definitley a movie for kids and parents.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

I'm going to say, that this movie was absolutley incredible. I loved the way it was photographed, the way it was directed by Joe Johnston, the way the special effects were created, and the producing by Jon Landau (Dick Tracy, Titanic) was abslutley top notch. Any critic that disrespects this movie is out of their mind, because the whole time that you are watching this movie, you will be 100% entertained and not bored at all. I recently heard this movie will be released on DVD without any special features! If you ask me, this movie deserves to have a special edition with a ton of features. I would for sure love to see how the special effects came to life. So if any of the producers or financers at Disney read this, please post pone the October release to a later one so that you can work on a freakin special edition.

63,AsifZamir,He's still a better dad than most!,10,21 November 2013,"You must have watched this movie by now. Honey I Shrunk the Kids is a highly entertaining family movie. Wayne is a bit of an eccentric inventor and invents a machine, that blows objects up, as well as shrinks them. The machine is still in the works when his children and the children of neighbour Russ Thompson Sr accidentally shrink themselves. Wayne leaves to go to a meeting to see if he can attain funding for his project and by the time he gets back, the kids have been accidentally shrunk. Russ Sr and his wife leave ahead to go on an extended trip they had planned and Russ Sr lies about his children missing, insisting they were going to be grounded. After the kids have been accidentally shrunk to less than half an inch, Wayne returns home and doesn't realize what has happened right away. He goes to sit down on his couch, which is no longer there, and not cluing in he starts destroying the machine because he is frustrated from the meeting he had earlier which didn't go anywhere and everyone walked out on him. He sweeps up the mess and sends the kids out to the trash. They then embark on the mission of trying to get back to the house, which is miles away to children of their size, and the journey they take is full of mishaps. Nick is picked up by a bumble bee, and Russ Jr jumps onto the bee to try and save his friend, where they become divided from the other two. While battling sprinklers, and Amy nearly drowning in mud, battling a scorpion and being thrown by a lawn mower they eventually return home. Honey I Shrunk the Kids was produced by Walt Disney Pictures. It was Joe Johnston's Directorial Debut and was produced in 1989. This action comedy will keep you on the edge of your seat. I still remember Moranis saying ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids."" The way he said it was so original and it instilled a sense of panic with 'oh no' what happens now? Honey I Shrunk the Kids was one of my favourite movies as a child. Okay, so the dad shrunk the kids, but at least he's active in their life.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

They escape from the bag and have an adventure going through the yard and get back to the house on two of the kid's dog. They are able to be turned back to normal size by the machine.

67,Bing-18,Disney.,6,27 January 2000,"This movie is what you would expect from Disney away from animation, though it is better than its usual offerings in this area.Rick Moranis has been trying to escape this role ever since, with two inferior sequels and a Disney attraction short, he has found it almost impossible to show his undoubted talent as a comedic actor away from this franchise.The rest of the cast is largely made up of Disney house actors who crop up in attraction shorts and other Disney movies best left forgotten while their contract runs and so do nothing more than say the lines.Moranis' neighbour is the only other comic highlight in this movie and so this is children's fluff and, apart from the special effects, not much more.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

I also really liked the dad, Dwayne, for some reason, I just found him very likeable. As well as the mom Diane. Both good, and they feel like they have legit chemistry as husband & wife. The movie is also very well paced and engaging. However one flaw I have with the film is that the titular 4 kids are very boring. They're all such dated cliches and I feel nothing towards them and their ""character arcs."" But they're all acted well enough and work completely functionally as protagonist so it doesn't ruin the movie at all.So yeah... good movie. I'd give it 84%","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

The best episode as far as I am concerned was the Morpheus episode where the daughter is afraid to take a test and the boy is afraid of dissecting frogs. I don't want to be accused of including too much plot so I won't say anything more but this particular episode was one of the best written shows ever to appear on TV.

Oh man, does it ever!Director Joe Johnston (Jumanji, Captain America: The First Avenger, Jurassic Park III) is a former visual effects artists – and his strengths derived from that background are on display full force here. This film is absolutely gorgeous. The production design, miniature work, and creature effects are all extremely effective, and hold up far better than I ever expected them to. It's not just a visually stunning film either, it's pure fun. From start to finish, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids maintains a thrilling, fast-paced sense of excitement and adventure.

Rick Moranis (who is one funny guy) invents a machine that scales down objects in its path. Unfortunately things go wrong, and the kids get shrunk (hence the title). Basically most of the film is spent focusing on the kids as they battle through the garden (which, viewed from their eyes is like a forest) trying to find their way back home. Classic moments include the water sprinkler being turned on - you see the kids running away from the huge water drops - and the kids riding on the back of an ant.

Of course, I am using a Telivision with FRAME right issues sometimes...but I still caught 99.9%. It was a FLASH scene of light that did it. Its a model with a different light projector which didn't function 100%. Its one of the models well, they were trying to invent HD TV's. Anyway, so what was the point? The movie not the TV. Right. Sorry, I am kinda like the TV Dad, I tear in different directions trying to solve a number of problems or getting tied up in 1. Its a cross. Anyway, the movie and not me...right. I loved watching this movie...again. It took me back to my childhood. Gosh. It took me a few reviews, but someone did review it as a retrospective, but they fell into the drama of the comedy of Steven Speilberg. They...um mentioned...they mourned the death of...the ant. Enough said. Its comedy, and shoot, this comedy is much better. I love nothing more than finding these movies. Anyway, the movie? Who can say a word against it. its full of action, and its slap stick comedy. Join the adventures of household of two kids trying to journey back threw there unkempt backyard as the adults realize there kids and neighbors kids are MISSING and its because ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"" so now there making mistakes in trying to search for them.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
85,primarilycritical,Questions and Ideas...,7,24 March 2014,"How realistic is the bee sequence?So, I don't know about all you fine people, but I for one bought into the whole idea of the shrink ray. So we're going to put that to the side and call it. Realistic.Now, on to the bee. At some point during the film, our crazy group of youngsters find themselves at odds with a bee. The bee is very big, and drags two of the party away for a trip around the yard. It is subsequently hit with a baseball bat, while the kids are on board, and crashes. But it doesn't just crash anywhere in the ""three mile"" yard, it crashes right next to where they left. Let me re-iterate. Two 1/4 inch kids, were hit with a baseball bat, survived. Then plummeted toward the earth, landing in dense jungle (equivalent), survived. Then, as though lighting struck the same place twice, they return to their friends completely unscathed.It seems to me they could have simply had Wayne run away, and had the bee return to the flower that it abandoned. That would have been waaaay more believable. you know, given that this movie is already unbelievable. Why push it.Why are the parents so calm?Big Russ seems to be the only one who is emotionally invested in the outcome of his children. Yes, he's a douche, but all the other parents seem to have some kinda nonchalance. Wayne and Diane find time to repair their failing marriage. Diane only seems to be worried that her daughter ""behaves"" with the neighbour boy. Mae spends all her time trying to rein in her husband, and his exuberance. But that night, everyone sleepsSleep?Call me crazy, but this might be an extreme situation. How could anyone sleep one day after the fact? I know, Wayne stays up to complete the repairs, but he does fall asleep. Idiot. And really? Who would take a club to years of hard work? He trashed that machine without much provocation. Even if it never worked, he could have sold it as a death ray..Alternate plans.Build a signal fire. Stay with the garbage. Travel on pavement, or along the fence. The parents could have instructed them. (Guided them, given them options, done something other then look through a spyglass) Call the authorities, (I'm sure they could have gotten the attention of someone with real clout. It's a shrink ray for gods sake, anyone would pay to see that work) ConclusionIt was a spectacle piece, and the only reason I wanted it to make more sense, was because I liked it. It was fun.http://www.primarilycritical.com","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
86,frigginsweet80,Simply wonderful,10,21 July 2019,"How do you give this movie less then 10 stars 🌟? This movie is so much fun and full of heart. We all have imagined this happening to us and if you say you don't then I say to you, ""we've grown up Peter Pan and lost your way""","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
87,aditya-nathan,Good children movie,5,5 December 2015,"If you ask me ""is this a good movie?"". No, not at all. But its a movie for kids so i guess it is meant to be ridiculous. In fact it's ridiculous in a good way.I've seen this movie a few times when i was a kid and i enjoyed it a lot. I mean, who doesn't want to ride an ant, sleep in a lego, or swimming in a bowl of cereal while trying to save ourselves from being eaten by our own dad? Though i prefer its sequel (or prequel i forgot) where the baby became big (forgot the name)With that being said, its a fun kids movie that probably can be enjoyed by parents too. (But i doubt it)","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
88,rdmingham,"Brilliant, fun adventure",8,12 July 2009,"I hadn't seen this film for about 10 years, and on a whim my younger brother and I watched it last night (we are now 18 and 19), and I have to say it's still an absolutely fantastic movie.There is comedy, adventure, and some fantasy close calls. Just what a family needs. Albeit the Nick character can get a little annoying with his 'over-nerdiness' but that's forgivable. This is most definitely a must see movie for all. At least to have seen it once.Looking through the other reviews I must say I'm rather confused as to why people are voting 'on a child basis' and also on 'an adult basis.' Films are written, produced and targeted at a specific target, and this is clearly for kids, family and any adult who is in a sort of relaxed and childish mood. Let me put it another way..... you wouldn't say 'well I thought 'the Hill have Eyes' was a brilliant film, so 8 out of 10 for me, but to be honest I don't think my 5 year old daughter would like it so from a kid's perspective I'd give it a 3/10.' Make sense? Seriously, have a laugh, and watch a film that is so memorable I guarantee you will recollect and remember it even 5 or 10 years down the line.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
89,babu5584,A Must watch fiction film with family values,9,5 October 2019,"I dont just regard this as a scifi comedy . Its about upraising of the children in late 80s , their life styles, and about what we consider probably as the existence of last generation of positive husband-wife relationships .
I watched this movie almost 30 years back, when i was a kid, in video cassette recorder and still could remember the thrill n excitement felt then.
I define a movie as an unrealistic depiction of a story or collection of events which can thrill the audiences . Honey....kids just thrills you with the content with full of emotions . The reason why i said emotion is just because -this movie carries the emotions of the youngest kid around 7 years of age to the mid-aged struggling scientist solanski straight in to the heart of the audiences ..
its a master piece !!!","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
90,nithinsunilthypparampil,"Honey, I shrunk the kids",10,27 April 2021,"Honey, shrunk the kids is one of the most watched movies in my list. It became a repeatedly watched movie because even after years the freshness is still in it. The movie was released in 1989 I missed theatre experience, but even in small screen it feel surprisingly great. A must watch movie.","Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"
