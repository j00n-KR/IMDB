0,TheLittleSongbird,Nightmarish trauma,8,5 August 2018,"'You Were Never Really Here' compelled me to watch it from the start. The fact that people were describing it as an unconventional thriller interested me, there are not many of those these days (speaking as a fan of thrillers), and then you have an extremely talented actor in Joaquin Phoenix in the lead role. The positive word of mouth and cool advertising added further to the promise.Seeing it, 'You Were Never Really Here' came over as very good and very impressive. Can totally understand why it is divisive here and it is not surprising that some were alienated by it and not used to a thriller being done differently. It's hardly the first or only divisive film from 2018 so far, 'A Quiet Place' and 'Hereditary' were very different horrors that were critically acclaimed but polarising with audiences, personally loved both, especially 'A Quiet Place'. For me, that it was unconventional was a large part of why 'You Were Never Really Here' worked as well as it did. It is not quite a masterpiece and it just falls short of being one of my very favourite films of the year (though it is still towards the top).It is not perfect. 'You Were Never Really Here' does have moments where the story could have done with more clarity, the vagueness did cause a little confusion at times. Would have liked much more development to the supporting characters, while the protagonist is splendidly drawn the rest are sketchy.However, there is so much to like about 'You Were Never Really Here'. The production values are extremely stylish with some very creative shots and film techniques, the rescue is particularly gritty and purposefully grainy in a security camera way. The minimal dialogue was a good choice, it let the atmosphere fully sear and the uncompromising brutality and unsettlement ensures plenty of deliberately slow-burning tension which helps make the story absorbing.Lynne Ramsay directs cleverly, with a keen eye for visual style, letting the atmosphere speak for itself and never letting the deliberate pacing to become dull or self-indulgent. That's personal opinion, just to make that clear to anybody who will vehemently disagree. 'You Were Never Really Here' is successful in avoiding clichés and having the action scenes brief, not frequent and mostly off-screen provided to be a bold and good move. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent in the lead role, the intensity dripping off him at every turn. The rest of the cast do well but not to the same level of Phoenix, but only because he is something else. Altogether, very good but so many great things. With better fleshed out characters and more clarity in some of the plotting, it would have been even better. 8/10 Bethany Cox",You Were Never Really Here
1,Leofwine_draca,A yawner,3,22 October 2019,"YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE did interest me at first, until I found out that the director was none other than Lynne Ramsay, who made the overrated WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN. This one's even worse, a loose reworking of TAXI DRIVER made on a tiny budget with very little in the way of originality or plot to make it work. Phoenix gives a believable performance in the lead role but is too understated to be entertaining; he's no De Niro. The film gets tedious very quickly and goes down the arthouse route of dragging every scene out a little bit too long so that it becomes boring, and needless flashbacks and the like slow it down further. Genuinely suspenseful revenge films such as BLUE RUIN or even the comedic I DON'T FEEL AT HOME IN THIS WORLD ANYMORE are much better.",You Were Never Really Here
2,SnoopyStyle,some good work from Joaquin,7,7 March 2019,"Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) is troubled living in New York City caring for his elderly mother and asphyxiating himself for comfort from a troubling past. He is hired to recover State Senator Albert Votto's runaway young daughter Nina from an underaged girls brothel. He buys a hammer and smashes his way through his crusade. He saves Nina but are confronted by murderous corrupt cops. It's the tip of a dangerous conspiracy leading all the way to the governor's mansion.The first thirty minutes is a bit rough. It's an artsy meandering slow disjointed slice of life into Joe. I get it but it could be clearer. It does give a feel for the guy. It would be great to have a more complete flashback to his military or policing days instead of short flashes of everything. Once he gets hammering, the movie goes like a freight train with Joaquin driving hard. He delivers a great performance as usual. There is a shock ending which I don't like. Indies like to punctuate the end of their movies with a gunshot. It's a bit cheap and feels amateurish. Overall, there are some great work with a few flaws.",You Were Never Really Here
3,Hitchcoc,Taxi Driver Redux,8,6 January 2021,"I can appreciate the artistry of this film. Phoenix is near the top of most lists these days. His character is damaged and deranged. Like Taxi Driver, it is hard to be positive when the subject matter is so disgusting. The abject cruelty of all, not just Joe, is awfully hard to watch. Usually, you see some endgame for these, some hope. I suppose his relationship with the girl will at least bring a bit of sunshine, but the brutality is so much.",You Were Never Really Here
4,Horst_In_Translation,Ramsay and Phoenix at their most devastating,6,3 May 2018,"""You Were Never Really Here"" is the most recent English-language movie written and directed by Lynne Ramsay and based on a novel by Jonathan Ames. If we don't count her BAFTA-winning short, it is Ramsay's first filmmaking effort since 2011, so a pretty long break. For the main character, a disillusioned hitman whose only purpose in life it is to care for his mother, she got one of the finest out there, namely Joquin Phoenix. Roberts and Doman are maybe actors you have come across in other works, but really it is all about Phoenix. It's not a very long movie in slightly under 90 minutes even, but a pretty shocking one at times and also very brutal with implications and graphic depictions. The protagonist receives a new job when he is instructed to free the daughter of an influential politician from her captors that seem to intend to sell her as a sex slave. This core plot already tells you that it's heavy stuff. But there is a lot more to that and nothing is what it seems as eventually tragic things happen to our ""hero"" that may very well result in a bloody path of revenge. This film is one that needs to be seen several times and still isn't entirely understood then I guess because there is really despite all the graphic action so very much going on under the surface that it is even difficult to really identify core plot developments. The ending is the best example. Is he no longer able to suppress his pedophilia in the face of him losing his mother and he goes away with the girl and starts a relationship. Or does he actually die at the end and join the girl who died earlier and all we see at the end is fictionalized with the waiters not really seeing the suicide because he was never really there as a reference to the title. If it was the latter, then you can also discuss when exactly he died before that. In general I think it is a good film for discussion and it's always nice to see quality material like this with very brutal scenes from a female filmmaker. A bold approach for sure.This is a film that I definitely want to see again at some point a few years, or maybe even months only from now. The more I think about it, the more I like it. But that of course really also has a great deal to do with Joaquin Phoenix as he is a definite contender for my number 1 favorite actor. He is once again really impressive and there seem to be no limitations to the roles and shades he is able to pull off. He is the epitome of vulnerable combined with physically ruthless in this one. It would have been amazing to see him get more awards recognition, but Cannes isn't too bad and honestly I am not surprised at all that the film itself and everything that goes with it really isn't Oscar material. The other actors are good too though with what they were given. I mentioned the running time earlier already, but I think it's good they did not drag the film for the sake of making it to 100 minutes only. It's very essential. The only ones who should not see this are those that disliike Phoenix because honestly he is the movie (but why would you) and those who cannot stomach graphic display of violence or heavy subjects like pedophilia. Everybody else should want to give this one a go and it is close to making my favorite list for 2017, maybe on rewatch. Go check it out. One final note: I reviewed this movie and I cannot make any references to the book it is based on about similarities, differences, quality comparisons etc. because I didn't read it. But you definitely don't need to in order to like the movie.",You Were Never Really Here
5,claudio_carvalho,Overrated and Boring,3,19 April 2018,"Sometimes it is difficult to understand and believe in the IMDb User Rating. The disappointing ""You Were Never Really Here"" is one example of an overrated film. Professional critics are opinion makers that serve as models to viewers that follow like sheep their opinions. This attitude might explain the IMDB User Rating. With regard to ""You Were Never Really Here"", the storyline is confused; the lead character is poorly developed; the screenplay is awful; the pace is boring. Therefore, it is hard to accept the 7.1 rating. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""You Were Never Really Here""",You Were Never Really Here
6,nogodnomasters,"Say it ain't so, Joe.",4,15 April 2018,"Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) is a troubled vet who works as an unlicensed private investigator/fix it hammer for hire while he cares for his frail mother (Judith Roberts). His next job is to rescue a New York state senator's daughter from sex traffickers. He has trouble with reality and flash backs as he goes about his job. We see a lot of scenes and then must surmise what happened. Joe was rather boring, spending much of the film in a cab and public transportation instead of a sleek Audi. Then the bad guys take it to Joe and I failed to feel any intensity, simply wondering if it was real or a flashback and why should I care.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",You Were Never Really Here
7,kosmasp,How to ...,8,31 August 2018,"Many things - one of them to explain this or the way it takes. I couldn't put my finger on a couple of things after the first time I watched this. So it warrants more than one viewing if you are into it of course. Phoenix is really good and the movie itself delves and stays in the mystery realm. There is a reason for that title, the viewer has just to find out which it is.It also has a pace some might find problematic. But this was not aimed to please large crowds. This was made for a specific audience and they will get it. That doesn't mean it's good or bad to feel one way or the other. Different tastes and all that, which is good, because otherwise what would we argue about, right?",You Were Never Really Here
8,classicsoncall,"""Let's go. It's a beautiful day.""",8,21 July 2021,"A compelling blend of reverie and reality confronts the viewer in ""You Were Never Really Here"", and at times it's up to the viewer to decide which is which. The only thing certain is that Joaquin Phoenix once again challenges with his bizarre and penetrating performance as a world weary bounty hunter for missing teenage girls, those most often abducted for an illicit sex trade. When his most recent assignment calls for the rescue of a state senator's daughter, the trail leads to an even higher government official who's influence threatens Joe's (Phoenix) very existence. Multiple flashbacks of Joe's tortured upbringing foreshadow his insistence on dealing harshly with his targets, with a unique predilection for the use of hammers while dispatching those within the scope of his wrath. A final scene threatens to unravel the success of his final mission until fortunately, he's brought back to reality by the young woman he saved. Fans of unconventional thrillers will almost certainly find something of value in this offbeat effort by Phoenix, who with his more recent film roles, appears to have taken up the mantle once largely worn by Johnny Depp.",You Were Never Really Here
9,lee_eisenberg,Joaquin Phoenix's most intense role,8,18 November 2019,"Over the past twenty years, Joaquin Phoenix has proven himself to be one of the finest actors in the US, with roles in ""Gladiator"", ""Walk the Line"", ""Don't Worry He Won't Get Far on Foot"" and others; basically, he has the career that his late brother River could've had. But probably Phoenix's most intense role is in Lynne Ramsay's ""You Were Never Really Here"". He plays a damaged war vet who rescues trafficked girls. But when he has to rescue the daughter of a state senator, he finds out something that could upend people's careers.It's not a masterpiece - certainly not ""Taxi Driver"", to which people have been comparing it - but worth seeing. Not one that you're likely to forget any time soon. Indeed, you might end up feeling as though Phoenix's character just used his hammer against you.So yes, angel baby, come back home.",You Were Never Really Here
10,jboothmillard,You Were Never Really Here,5,29 October 2019,"I heard about this film quite a few times during and after its release, mainly praising the lead actor, at the time I had seen him be brilliant as the Joker, so I was most interested to watch him in this, directed by Lynne Ramsay (We Need to Talk About Kevin). Basically, Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) is a traumatised and suicidal former soldier. He is haunted by memories of brutality during the Gulf War and of his violent father abusing his now frail mother (Judith Roberts) who he is living with and looking after. He also has fantasies of killing himself which disorients his concept of reality. Joe now uses his military skills working as an unflinching hired gun specialising in recovering missing teens. These abducted girls have their families not wanting to involve the authorities, so Joe embarks on blood-drenched rescue missions. Joe realises, following an assignment, that he has been seen by Moises (Vinicius Damasceno), the son of Angel (Frank Pando) who acts as middleman between Joe and his handler John McCleary (John Doman). Joe tells McCleary that Angel knows his address and may pose a security risk. Joe's latest contract is to liberate the teenage daughter of New York State Senator Albert Votto (Alex Manette). The politician has offered a large sum of money to discreetly rescue his abducted daughter Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov) who has been trafficked into a brothel. Joe stakes out the brothel, kills several security guards and patrons, and rescues Nina. Joe and Nina await Votto's arrival in a hotel room, but a television news broadcast reports that Votto has committed suicide. Police officers kill the hotel clerk after gaining access to the room and take Nina. Joe kills one of the officers and then escapes. Joe finds out that government agents in search of his address have killed McCleary, Angel and Moises. Arriving home, he finds two agents who have been waiting for him, and they have murdered his mother. He kills one agent and mortally wounds the other, who reveals that Governor Williams (Jurassic Park III's Alessandro Nivola) is directing the authorities to cover up the trafficking, and that Nina is Williams's favourite. Joe gives his mother a water burial. He then attempts to drown himself, but as he sinks, he has a vision of Nina, and swims back to the surface. Joe follows Williams to his country home and fights his way in but discovers Williams already dead with his throat slit. He searches the house and finds Nina sitting down with a bloody straight razor. They rest at a diner, there Joe has a violent suicidal fantasy and passes out. Nina wakes him, saying, ""It's a beautiful day."" He agrees, and they leave together. Also starring Joker's Dante Pereira-Olson as Young Joe. Phoenix does give a pretty good performance as the man unafraid of violence and prepared to go to any measures with a job that spins out of control, there is a fair amount of bloodshed and violence (most being offscreen), the story is a bit vague and confusing at times, but it is intense and unsettling enough to keep you going, a relatively interesting psychological action thriller. It was nominated the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film of the Year. Worth watching!",You Were Never Really Here
11,george.schmidt,Derivative kissing cousin of 'TAXI DRIVER',7,17 April 2018,"YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE (2018) **1/2 Joaquin Phoenix, Judith Roberts, John Doman, Alex Manette, Ekaterina Samsonov, Alessandro Novola. Derivative kissing cousin of 'TAXI DRIVER' with Phoenix (who excels) as a veteran who finds employment in saving exploited young girls for a living ultimately meets his match when an assignment goes awry leading to a dark downward spiral of his inner demons at play. While filmmaker Lynne Ramsay - who adapted the screenplay based on Jonathan Ames - displays a keen visual and sonic sense of character and plot - such as it is - there is very little to go on outside the threadbare schematics at hand (haunted vet plagued by a violent past unleashes hell at any cost). Somewhat disappointing in the long run but worth watching its star go from implosive to explosive.",You Were Never Really Here
12,evanston_dad,Gets in Your Head and Stays There,9,11 January 2019,"Lynne Ramsay's mesmerizing fever dream of a movie, ""You Were Never Really Here,"" is the kind of film that burrows into your head and stays there for days.I recognize Joaquin Phoenix as a good actor, but I've stayed mostly resistant to him because.....well, because he's just so gross. But that actually works to his advantage in this role, that of a deeply damaged hit man (maybe there's no other kind?) who's hired to rescue a government official's daughter from a sex trafficking ring. The film is set in the same nocturnal nighttime world as films like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Mulholland Drive,"" where even scenes set during the day have the tinge of a nightmare. Ramsay takes her time, but the film never feels ponderous or lugubrious, and the whole thing is driven by a sensational score by Johnny Greenwood.The ending of the film felt reminiscent of another of this year's best, Paul Schrader's ""First Reformed."" Both films offer a choose your own adventure of sorts to cap off a horrifying narrative, and hang the fate of the main character on the individual viewer's belief in happy endings.Grade: A",You Were Never Really Here
13,ferguson-6,Brutal and wonderful,8,12 April 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. Scottish director Lynne Ramsay doesn't shy away from tough material. In fact, she seems to thrive on it. Following the emotional turmoil of WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011) she delivers her latest, which can best be described as brutal. The brutality here is not the on screen violence - we get mostly the aftermath or only see the 'edges' of terrible deeds. No, the brutality here is in a world that needs a man like Joe.Joaquin Phoenix plays Joe, a former military man who lives with his mother. Joe has a particular set of skills that fit into the narrow career niche of rescuing kidnapped girls and ridding society of their captors. Rather than a hired gun, Joe is a hired hammer ... ballpeen hammer being his sentimental and strategic weapon of choice. Joe is also a bit mentally unstable, likely suicidal, and haunted by inner demons. Yet he is also patient and kind with his elderly mother (Judith Roberts). Joe's most recent job is to find and rescue a State Senator's daughter (Ekaterina Samsonov) from an underground sex ring run by some powerful political types. The job is a success right up until it isn't. It's at this point when Joe finds a reason to live ... vengeance. It's also when Mr. Phoenix becomes a legitimate contender for an Oscar nomination. His hulk of a man with a lumbering gait experiences and dozens of body scars. He has these flashbacks which are so short spurts, at times they feel like mere teases. Soon enough we assemble the pieces to know the baggage from a traumatic childhood event, and the front lines of a horrific war, have created this shell of a man with his own set of principles.John Doman and Alessandro Nivola have minor supporting roles, but this one rides on the battered and no longer symmetrical shoulders of Joaquin Phoenix, and the creative stylings of filmmaker Lynne Ramsay. It is imagery combined with performance and the result is spellbinding. If you can handle it, the film provides a cinematic journey to depths not typically reached.Best not to fill in many of the film's specifics, but the comparisons to TAXI DRIVER are apropos. I found myself wondering if Paul Schrader was consulted in the adaptation of Jonathan Ames' source material book. The city streets and dank hotel rooms scream gritty 1970's thriller, and the recurring shots of plastic bags over the head emphasize the claustrophobia Joe experiences. This is doubtless meant to be commentary on politicians and the corrupt power they wield, but it works less as that and more as a glimpse at one man's darkness. Add to that the pulsating score from Jonny Greenwood, and the creepy use of ""My Angel Baby"" by Rosie and Originals, and only one word can describe Ms. Ramsay's film ... brutal.",You Were Never Really Here
14,morrison-dylan-fan,Really Here.,6,11 March 2018,"Going to do some shopping for Easter in Birmingham,I decided to take a look at what was screening at the oldest cinema in the UK (The Electric.) Previously hearing about her from the infamous walk-off on the interesting Western Jane Got A Gun,I was intrigued to find writer/director Lynne Ramsay's new title being screened,which led to me finding out if you were really here.Backed by the unsettling, screeching hum of Jonny Greenwood's Industrial score,writer/director Lynne Ramsay & cinematographer Thomas Townend wash the filth from the street in grainy digital, that gives the movie a visceral grubby atmosphere, as Joe searches backstreet buildings covered in grime,and the short,sharp shots of violence burn in dried red. Tracking Joe's shattered glass mind, Ramsay reflects his past in jagged flashbacks, with the rough edges strongly suggesting,but not fully revealing,what was there in Joe's childhood.Caked in a scraggy beard, Joaquin Phoenix gives an excellent performance as Joe,whose Noir loner outlook is fuelled by Phoenix giving Joe a dead to the world gaze,which strikes with each hammer blow he gives to the scum of the earth. Finding an empathetic connection with Nina, (played by a very good Ekaterina Samsonov) Phoenix allows Joe to express care for Nina,whilst always remaining aware of the tar-pit they are trapped in. Taking the wheel from Jonathan Ames's novel,the screenplay by Ramsay aims to examine the psychological side of Joe,but misses the mark with consistent ""borrowing"" from Taxi Driver. Suggesting that Joe is a damaged war vet,Ramsay is unable to avoid drawing from Taxi Driver's child prostitute,pimps,loners and corrupt politicians in the most empty manner possible,with Ramsay failing to give any additional depth to the themes explored in Taxi. Weaving flashbacks to Joe's abusive childhood, Ramsay's attempt to give Joe a psychological depth disappointingly fails to fully alight, due to Joe's fight to protect Nina not becoming fully thread with his own past,which was never really here...",You Were Never Really Here
15,bombersflyup,I wish I was never really here.,2,14 October 2018,"You Were Never Really Here is an underwritten film of nothingness.I'm at a loss as to what I'm suppose to get out of this. There's almost no dialogue, if you take out the song lines. It's not annoying in any way and Phoenix's fine in the limited role, but the film has little to offer. I mean really, what makes this better than any random Steven Seagal flick. At least there's some amusement in those.I see a lot of reviews saying mostly negative things and yet still rating it highly, the rating should reflect the review.",You Were Never Really Here
16,deloudelouvain,A missed opportunity. Very overrated movie.,3,2 May 2018,"I really really tried to like this movie. It's totally a movie that I would go for normally. A guy hunting down peadophiles and bashing their heads in, I think it's awesome. And the movie could have been awesome if only there was a line in it. Now the movie just hops from one scene to another without any explanation, and half of the time it doesn't make any sense at all. Very pretentious from Lynne Ramsay if she thought she would get away with it. The filming wasn't bad, the violence was on top, and the acting of Joaquin Phoenix was good, but the story was a major letdown. This movie is the perfect example on how to bomb a movie that could have been good. They should use it in classrooms to show the future directors how to not make a movie.

17,christopher-underwood,looks more than a little pretentious by the end,7,3 January 2019,"This begins in sensational manner with invigorating and imaginative cinematography, exciting and pounding score and a prowling oddball and ruthless central character, played by Joaquin Phoenix grabbing our attention at once. There is some mumbling, indistinct narrative flow and Phoenix is off, hammer in hand to get a job done. However after what seems mission accomplished things go a little awry for Phoenix within the slender storyline and for us in a muddled directive style, hampered even more by Phoenix's incoherence. At one time he is mumbling to some unfortunate who cannot speak properly and I cannot understand what either of them are saying. None of this would matter if the director had a firm grip and knew where she was going but this is all over the place and looks more than a little pretentious by the end.",You Were Never Really Here
18,namashi_1,Doesn't Hit The Hammer Entirely!,5,26 April 2018,"Lynne Ramsay's 'You Were Never Really Here' is a film, that wants to disturb you and also creep you out. This is a brutally violent, psychologically graphic film, about a traumatized man. And while some of it is undeniably powerful, some of it, is also uneven & the narrative's predictability disappoints. 'You Were Never Really Here' Synopsis: A traumatized veteran, unafraid of violence, tracks down missing girls for a living. When a job spins out of control, Joe's nightmares overtake him as a conspiracy is uncovered leading to what may be his death trip or his awakening.'You Were Never Really Here' begins hauntingly & some of the unexpected brutality here will make your heartbeat race fast. And the film is great for its first half hour. But once the protagonist gets on the mission to save the girl & realizes a conspiracy behind it, the plot wears thin. The narrative, which is beautifully unpredictable in its initial reels, suddenly turns into a revenge saga of sorts. And that aspect doesn't really work. You know exactly thereon, on what's gonna happen & how things are gonna play out. Its like watching two films here, one being an unpredictable one about a man with serious baggage, and the other, about a man out for vengeance.Based on the book of the same name by Jonathan Ames, Lynne Ramsey's adapts the story to so-so effect. Ramsey's Writing is partly engrossing & party disappointing. The predictability wears you off. Ramsey's Direction is excellent & deserves credit for creating an absolutely bleak atmosphere. Cinematography captures the madness & the violence, to detailed results. Editing is pretty crisp, as the film culminates under 90-minutes. Art Design, Costume Design & The Choreography of Action-Sequences, are pretty solid.Performance-Wise: Joaquin Phoenix can never be doubted. The versatile, fearless actor portrays the traumatized protagonist with conviction. Although far from his best performances, Joaquin still puts up a good show of his talent. Ekaterina Samsonov is very effective. Judith Roberts is wonderful. John Doman leaves a strong mark.On the whole, 'You Were Never Really Here' needed to be stronger.

Starring Joaquin Phoenix as Joe a man who's an ex war veteran with apparent emotional and mental problems who now has a life of looking after his mother. Yet get this on the side he tracks down missing girls for a living. Slowly yet surely his life starts to spin out of control.

20,lasttimeisaw,"You were never really here and I've never been to me, either!",8,12 November 2017,"Fourth feature from the button-pushing Lynne Ramsay, YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE pits Joaquin Phoenix's emotionally blocked veteran Joe against a sordid child prostitution ring, meanwhile he is also seeking an outlet from the besetting trauma of his checkered past. It is a gut-wrenching story on paper, but Ramsay configures sundry conceits to present a ""reductive"" diorama of the events, and the most prominent one is the viewpoint, which never deflects from Joe, hence signifies that there will be no lengthy flashback sequences to inform us what he has experienced (as a child, a soldier, etc.), only through the transient fragments of memory incessantly penetrating into Joe's heads, audience can piece it together proximately, but never the full picture, because for once, we don't need to know it, what is at stake here is its traumatic after effect. Secondly, Lamsay flags up a bloated/beefed-up Phoenix's body metamorphosis, which brings about the corporeal testimony of what he has been suffering from, transferred through Ramsay's hyper-real observation (scars, bruise, etc.). Joe's knee-jerking coping mechanism towards the bane is self-suffocation, a leitmotif repeatedly wielded to induce our own gasping response, resounds hauntingly with the self-initiated count-down of Nina (Samsonov), the girl whom Joe is hellbent on rescuing from her pedophiliac abusers. Phoenix won BEST ACTOR is Cannes (along with Ramsay's script win), deservedly, his performance is arrestingly measured, profoundly unaffected but deeply affecting, because he invites us to care for Joe, a laconic, middle-aged, mom's boy, a damaged good whose weapon of choice is a hammer, he makes good as a brutal enforcer, using violence to repress his disturbed state, which is caused by violence/abuse itself, it is a vicious circle he cannot outrun, and we can pour out our sympathy to him when a bereft Joe decides to end his life in the lake (with the sublimely beauteous underwater stillness) before thinks better of it or near the denouement, a startled figment of his imagination prompts a perversely comical/shocking combo. Last but not the least, it is about how Ramsay choose to present its action of brutality, and she ingeniously points up its ""aftermath"" instead of showing the actual execution (during his first rescuing attempt inside a high-end New York apartment building, Joe's action is entirely captured by the fuzzy security camera), violence itself is ephemeral, what lingers behind is its aftermath, tangible, grisly and immutable. When Joe finally loses it after seeing what Nina has done (a big letdown to fans of Alessandro Nivola though), it is a scathing brickbat towards the state of affairs without the help of conventional verbosity, and inaugurates Joe's mental ablutions of his own existence. In the event, Ramsay's clean-cut, existential thriller owns to a lucid consciousness of its sensitive material, brilliant aptitude in its visual and sound literacy, also the film allows humor (a sprightly Judith Roberts as Joe's dotage-afflicted mother, sharing meta-PSYCHO joke in communion), and psychic vision (that moment when Joe realizes who is the culprit in his mind-scape) into the play, the main takeaway for me is the unexpected tendresse between Joe and a hit-man he has mortally injured (Price), lying together on the floor, humming along Charlene's '80s one-hit-wonder I'VE NEVER BEEN TO ME on the radio, and holding their hands, is the song really the answer to the film's English title? You were never really here and I've never been to me, either. Touché!",You Were Never Really Here
21,Hellmant,I was pretty blown-away by it!,10,4 May 2018,"'YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE': Five Stars (Out of Five)The critically acclaimed thriller from writer/director Lynne Ramsay, and based on the book (of the same name) by Jonathan Ames. The film stars Joaquin Phoenix as a former FBI agent, and military veteran, suffering from sever PTSD (and horrific hallucinations of his past), who now works as a hitman for hire, that also rescues trafficked girls. It costars Ekaterina Samsonov, Alex Manette, John Doman, Judith Roberts and Alessandro Nivola. The movie won Best Screenplay and Best Actor at the 70th Cannes Film Festival (where it premiered as an unfinished work in progress), and it's also gotten nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics. I was pretty blown-away by it as well. Joe (Phoenix) is a former FBI agent, and military vet, who now suffers from severe PTSD and disturbing hallucinations. He lives with his sick elderly mother (Roberts), and takes jobs killing people for money, as well as rescuing trafficked girls. His latest assignment is to save the 13-year-old daughter, Nina (Samsonov), of a New York Senator, Albert Votto (Manett), who was also abducted by very powerful sex traffickers. This latest job turns out to be excessively bloody, and dangerous, and it might finally push Joe over the edge into total madness.The movie is really intense and graphically violent. It's also a seemingly realistic (and pretty disturbing) look at what it's like for someone suffering from PTSD, and currently living in a very violent/bloody world. The film is masterfully directed by Ramsay, and Phoenix once again delivers one of the best performances of the year.

23,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Not a waste of time, but still fails to really make the most of its potential",7,1 August 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningJoe (Joaquin Phoenix) is a former war veteran, tormented by nightmarish visions of a past he's struggling to come to terms with. Lacking any real direction in his life, he's offered a shot at redemption when the ambitious Senator Albert Votto (Alex Manette) hires him to track down his missing daughter who's been dragged into the sex trade. However, despite accomplishing his mission, he finds himself plunged into a deadly game of revenge that plunges his already fragile mind over the edge.In a Hollywood landscape still recovering from the recession, we still find ourselves bombarded with 'franchise' movies dominating the multiplexes, either long dormant or presently in the cultural consciousness, a safe bet of making a box office return that justifies the budget. We still find more abstract, independent works being shuffled to the side lines, as seems to be the case with this effort from writer/director Lynne Ramsay, a dark, moody effort with little in the way of humour, and a central plot with plenty of potential that sadly never really engages you the way it should.In the lead role and truthfully as the only character of any real substance, Phoenix fits the role perfectly, gruff and stone faced, and looking like he's put on a few pounds and could do with hitting the gym, and indeed it's a dark, brutal thriller he inhabits, as is the case these days, brutal and pulling no punches, with some graphic, unflinching violence typical of modern cinema. It's trying to stand out as a film by being deeper and more pseudo-intellectual than your average thriller, and in doing so drowns itself in an arthouse vibe that ends up leaving you further absconded.It's too well made and intriguing to be a waste of time, but Ramsay leaves it all too ambiguous and uninvolving to really do it justice. ***",You Were Never Really Here
24,paul2001sw-1,If I had a Hammer,2,8 March 2021,"I don't usually like to put spoliers into my reviews, but some films are so incoherent that it's almost impossible to generalise about them. In Lynne Ramsay's 'You Were Never Really Here', Joaquim Pheonix plays a depressed man, who doesn't talk much (no helpful exposition here). 'Taxi Driver'-style, he resuces a teeage girl from a brothel (armed with a hammer!). Someone steals the girl from him and murders his mother. He lies on the floor of his kitchen, singing 1970s pop songs with the dying killer. He carries is mother's body into a lake while wearing a suit. He resuces the girl from an exquisite country house in a state of half-undress, armed once again with his hammer. In a diner he shoots himself, but nobody notices. The last bit at least transpires to have been a dream. The sountrack is consistently arresting but primarily due to its arbitrariness. Of what is supposed to be going on, I have absolutely no idea.",You Were Never Really Here
25,MOscarbradley,Another extraordinary film from this remarkable filmmaker,9,3 May 2018,"I've seen Lynne Ramsay's ""You Were Never Really Here"" compared to both ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Oldboy"" though stylistically it doesn't resemble either of them which is par for the course with Ramsay. If the plot isn't all that far removed from that of ""Taxi Driver"" that's about as far as it goes as Joaquin Phoenix's traumatised veteran goes in search of a senator's daughter who appears to have been kidnapped by a gang of paedophiles. However, Ramsay doesn't make it easy for us. The film is incredibly visual but is virtually wordless with the narrative being split by flashbacks to Phoenix's past, particularly to a violent childhood, apparently at the hands of his father.It is an extremely violent picture though mercifully most of the violence happens off-screen. Needless to say, Phoenix is terrific and won the best actor award last year at Cannes as did Ramsay's screenplay, adapted from a book by Jonathan Ames. It wasn't a commercial success and consequently was ignored by Oscar. It was also Ramsay's first film in six years and was only her fourth feature in 18 years. Let's hope we don't have to wait so long for another film from this remarkable woman.",You Were Never Really Here
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Dark, intense and immensely gripping; as discreet as it is devastating.",8,11 March 2018,"'You Were Never Really Here (2018)' is a dark, disturbing but discreet piece, one that's as off-kilter and uncomfortable as it is subdued. It's this remarkable restraint that allows its undercurrent of explosive violence, seedy deviance and childhood traumas to be all the more shocking and genuinely effecting when they erupt from the relative calm on the screen. It's an amazingly atmospheric and difficult watch that doesn't hold your hand, so that if you aren't always fully engaged then you may not wholly grasp the almost exposition-less plot. The explicit, brutally jarring flashes of a past narrative paint a picture of an incredibly wholistic implicit story, without filling in every blank, in an incredibly gripping way, leaving you to wallow in the head of a severely damaged individual and think about the experience for long after the credits have rolled. 8/10",You Were Never Really Here

Well, after seeing this film, it may be better suited as the 21st century Version of Taxi Driver. Lynne Ramsay did a marvelous job directing this moody & disturbing take on a veteran trying to find meaning in his life as he tracks down missing girls for a 'living'. It's full of nuance, contains absolutely haunting music, and a visually brutal revenge-thriller story overall.

We get glimpses of the trauma a hired gun (a chonky Joaquin Phoenix) has gone through, and gradually understand his strange life of bouncing between being his violent job and taking care of his elderly mother. It felt a little like it needed more fleshing out in all directions (past, present, and future), though the bare bones approach from director Lynne Ramsay was clearly an artistic choice, and I respect it. Still, it was hard to believe the trail of bodies, including those of high-profile people, wouldn't be more problematic, and the ending felt rather abrupt.",You Were Never Really Here
29,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,16 July 2018,"You Were Never Really HereThe best thing about killing people for a living is that you get to wear whatever you want to work.Mind you, the hit-man in this thriller enjoys doing it as an outlet for his anger.After the army, mentally unbalanced Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) now makes his living hammering heads of anyone he's hired to eliminate as a means to sustain his ill mother. But when he's paid to rescue the daughter of a Senator from a sex-traffic ring, Joe's actions lead to even worse consequences for him. Fueled by hallucinations, Joe risks everything to save the teenager from threats real and imagined.A gritty, unflinching look at the sad life of a lost veteran, this art-house take on the New York anti-hero has it's moments of touching brilliance thanks to Phoenix, but also many bouts of bewilderment and boredom.

Jokes aside, this movie even reminded me (sometimes) of ""Taxi Driver"" - regarding some story similarities. But eventually ""You Were Never Really Here"" does not know what it wants to be - mystery / noir / thriller / drama or whatever - but at the running time 1 h 25 min it started to drag more and more near the end.Overall, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is a messy movie. It is bloody, violent and not by a book thriller - but that does not make it great. This is not a bad movie by any means, but i was disappointing at the end and couldn't care less for a main character - maybe that was the point?

A stereotypical hook for this type of film genre. Tool of choice - a hammer thus a bit bloody, but little shown. The movie's plot is, unfortunately, an exploitation of a subject not to play film-making with which is the sex exploitation of young females (ironically, Amazon who backed this film in it's new venture is making money off of exploiting this topic). Interesting song choices as background used to parallel the storyline. So, with that in mind to Amazon and it's monied destruction of it's once beautiful host city I offer this song parody:

33,tomgillespie2002,A 90-minute punch to the gut,8,23 April 2018,"In the latest offering from the great cinematic filmmaker Lynne Ramsay, Joaquin Phoenix stars as a psychologically scarred combat veteran who dishes out his own particularly brutal brand of justice without blinking an eye. With his massive beard generously flecked with grey and straggly long hair tightly pulled back into a man-bun, he hasn't looked so dishevelled since his faux-public breakdown for Casey Affleck's mockumentary I'm Still Here in 2010. His clothes look like they haven't been washed in months, and there's a redness look in his eyes that hints at a lack of sleep or a reliance on prescription medication. He is packing a bit of a gut and a lack of definition, but he carries himself like a fearless UFC fighter bounding into the ring, ready and eager to destroy whoever is thrown in with him. His character, Joe, is a modern day Travis Bickle. Yet while you would cross the street in fear that Bickle may say or do something weird, you would flee from Joe just in case he bashes your skull in with a hammer.You Were Never Really Here, based on the novel by Jonathan Ames, is an incredibly violent, unflinching picture. But Ramsay is an intelligent, thoughtful filmmaker, way more interested in characters and mood to be distracted by the many horrors on show. She doesn't dwell on the violence, and instead views it through the eye of a security camera, or a half-seen reflection in a mirror. Sometimes even the sound alone, combined with Jonny Greenwood strange and hypnotic score, is more than enough to creature a vivid picture in your mind of what is transpiring. Ramsay simply isn't interested in visualising the bloodshed, and this shrewd approach skilfully makes the many horrific acts committed by Joe all the more wince-inducing. Her focus rests purely with Joe himself, beginning with a portrait of a man long pushed over the edge, before journeying even more inward and downward.Joe earns his keep by hiring himself out for covert missions that may require action not necessarily permitted by law. A purposefully confusing and violent opening sets the tone: Joe is simply not to be messed with, and does not flinch at the possibility of violence. He has a reputation for brutality, which is precisely the reason he is paid by frustrated parents to find missing kids, usually those kidnapped for sex trafficking purposes, by man-in-the-middle John McCleary (The Wire's John Doman). In his downtime, he also cares for his elderly mother (Judith Roberts). Ambitious young New York Senator Albert Votto (Alex Manette) wants Joe to locate his missing daughter Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov), and carry out whatever it takes to make her abductors suffer for their crimes. Joe accepts the job, and it doesn't take long for him to find the shell-shocked teenager. What happens next would be venturing into spoiler territory, but Joe is sent down a dark path to redemption, unravelling a conspiracy way above his pay grade.Despite what many critics have said, You Were Never Really Here isn't Lynne Ramsay's best film, and will surely be her most divisive. Some parts just don't work: Although it is by no means integral to film's themes and focus, the revelations of Joe's investigations may have attracted Liam Neeson with a vastly different director at the helm, and the final scene, which touches on fantasy, clashes uncomfortably with what came before. But these issues don't affect the film's sheer impact. At its best, You Were Never Really Here is pure cinema, dragging you through the squalor by the neck and plunging you into the mind of a truly damaged soul. I haven't felt so beaten up - in a good way - by a movie since the first time I saw Elem Klimov's Come and See. As Joe, Phoenix has probably never been better. He is a ticking time-bomb, favouring the use of a hammer against his enemies. In one of the film's finest scenes, Joe is asked by a young girl to take a picture of her and her friends. He mumbles and agrees, before a close-up of the girl reveals her to be crying. Is this a hallucination, or has she seen the pain etches across his face? Reality and dreams are melded together into a 90-minute punch to the gut, and Ramsay proves once again why she is one of the greatest working filmmakers.",You Were Never Really Here
34,eddie_baggins,Phoenix shines in this dark thriller,7,17 September 2018,"The fourth film of Lynne Ramsay's critically acclaimed career that has spanned over twenty years, You Were Never Really Here is the Scottish filmmaker's first feature since 2011's stunning We Need to Talk About Kevin and is another highly original and likely polarizing experience that will divide viewers between those that love and those that hate Ramsay's examination of PTSD and the demons that can plague one's mental state.Adapting Jonathan Adams book, Ramsay cares little for making Here a typical cinematic experience and while the trailer's for this Cannes winning experience would make it seem like something of a typical gruff criminal turned kind-hearted human caring for the well-being of a child, Here is anything but an experience that can be easily summed up.In a turn that has won many critical plaudits and the award for best actor at last year's Cannes Film Festival, Here focuses its attention on a bearded Joaquin Phoenix as the tormented Joe, an army/FBI veteran who now spends his days tracking down missing girls and enacting violent revenge attacks on the perpetrators with his trusty hammer and Joe is a complicated and layered creation that allows Ramsay to give Here a fever dream like state of mind as we follow Joe down a dark path that leads him to a life turning run in with missing politician's daughter Nina Votto.Guided by Ramsay behind the camera and accompanied by another haunting and untraditional score by Radiohead band member Johnny Greenwood, Here never once falls into a mood or vibe that will make you as a viewer feel comfortable with where things are at and it's clear that Ramsay didn't want us to ever get lulled into a sense of security with where things are going in this otherworldly like journey.Phoenix is brilliant in his role as Joe, a man we learn little about but a man we gather through brief and deliberately confusing flashbacks had both a troubled and violent childhood and some traumatic experiences in his time in the army and FBI and his commitment to his craft can't be faltered here, even if comparisons for his role and the film as a whole to Taxi Driver feel a little over the top considering this is a hard film to gel with emotionally.Doing so much right you do begin to wish around the halfway mark of Here's runtime that you felt more of a connection and attachment to the characters within the film and while Ramsay was no doubt uninterested in creating the usual feature film fair, further establishment of Joe and in particular his brief relationship with Nina would've been highly beneficial to a film that is both hauntingly beautiful and captivating when all clicks at once.Final Say - A confronting, raw and honest examination of the traumas of PTSD and mental demons, You Were Never Really Here is another fine addition to the Ramsay filmography and the continued good work of Phoenix but with its cold delivery, the film fails to engage on an emotional level that would've made it something very special indeed.3 ½ water burials out of 5",You Were Never Really Here
35,TheMovieDiorama,"You Were Never Really Here, simply put, is a stunning piece of cinema.",10,10 March 2018,"Warning: this review will excessively use the adjective ""phenomenal"". Phenomenal. Absolutely phenomenal. Phenomenally directed, acted and written. This phenomenal indie thriller will leave you breathless. An incredibly rare achievement to leave me hypnotised long after the credits roll, but Lynne Ramsay's latest intrusive yet intimate character study did that and then some. Centralising on Joe, a war veteran suffering from PTSD, who accepts a job to retrieve a politician's kidnapped daughter from a brothel. However in doing so, he risks the safety of his mother and his own life. This showcases Ramsay's supremely defiant directing style. Every scene, every camera movement and every little detail is a finely tuned mechanism to a large machine. The entire picture exudes confidence, such bold directing choices that elevates this above other indie titles. The visceral violence and bleak events that occur create several thrilling moments, but the palpable tension is illustrated through the character of Joe. A damaged man addicted to pain killers to deal with his hallucinogenic illusions that tamper with his sanity. Ramsay's screenplay never belittles him into an unlikeable state, the behests he accepts actually retains his humanity whilst portraying the excessive violence. All phenomenally played by Joaquin Phoenix who many consider to be one of the best actors working today. With this, I completely agree. Dialogue is kept to a minimum yet the amount of expression just from his face and body language was phenomenal. Jonny Greenwood's unsettling and intrusive score only adds to the heightened state of mind that the narrative conveys. Just utterly enthralling. My eyes never left the screen once. The ambiguous ending was the icing on the cake, solidifying its indie origins. Beautiful and horrific simultaneously. A perfect juxtaposition that illustrates the themes and technical talent conveyed through this phenomenal film. It gets the second perfect rating of the year. Cannot recommend this enough.",You Were Never Really Here

37,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Taken"" for the serious arthouse crowd",8,9 May 2018,"In ""You Were Never Really Here,"" writer and director Lynn Ramsay takes what might have been a more conventional revenge thriller or lone wolf battling his inner demons story and gives it a more harrowing, artistic edge. Think ""Taken"" but for the serious arthouse crowd.Ramsay, who last brought us the supremely dark and unforgettable ""We Need to Talk About Kevin,"" proves herself to be one of cinema's bravest voices working today with this film, about a war vet named Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) working as an enforcer/hired muscle who specializes in recovering missing children and exacting brutal revenge on the captors. It's a role that's big and roomy but internal and dark - perfect for a method actor like Phoenix - and the results are chilling.Ramsay is not gentle to the viewer at all in both the direction and adapting of Jonathan Ames' book. Although she leaves most of the violence to the imagination, what we don't see proves as compelling as the few calculated angles she does give us in any one take. What would be a traditional action sequence in a genre version of this story has a more haunting feel when Ramsay decides to tell it using only security camera footage of the premises where the action takes place. Add in Johnny Greenwood's score (seriously, is any film composer more interesting these days?) and a clear, compelling tone is set.The story also has no standard movie fat on it, forcing us (and Phoenix) to do most of the work in terms of making sense of what we seen on screen. We do get enough cutaways to flashbacks and sudden visions that piecing together Joe's personal narrative eventually becomes less laborious, but they are quick and abrasive, conveying the trauma and pain in a way that someone with Joe's troubled past might actually experience it. This storytelling approach to trauma feels unique considering the abundance of films in the 21st century that have dealt with it. ""You Were Never Really Here"" asks tough questions, chief among them being whether a deeply wounded person like Joe can find relief or peace in the work that he does. It's a conversation happening in the dark corner of a larger conversation about mental health, which is part of its strength and allure as a story.Some audiences will doubtless find Ramsay's film inaccessible; she has a way of denying audiences some of the core satisfactions of a traditional story. Some will also find it too dark and off-putting - similar criticisms were lobbed at ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" for broaching the uncomfortable territory of the mind of a mother trying to figure out what went wrong in the wake of her son committing a massacre at school. As provocative as it may be, Ramsay's voice is an important one that film, on the whole, could use more of in these troubling times.~Steven CThanks for reading!

39,imseeg,I truly think I have just witnessed the birth of the best film made in years...,10,4 May 2018,"Baffled. I am completely baffled at the end. And overwhelmed with goosebumps. A release of emotions followed right after and during the extra ordinary endcredits, because this movie really struck me head on. Was watching it in mounting amazement. Almost suffocating suspense. And it was all released at the very end. What a thrill...Sometimes a film comes along that streches all the boundaries of movie making. Anyone familiar with ""The Shining"" and ""Blue Velvet"" will know that these movies stretched story telling in a direction never seen before. If you dont know these titles, YOU GOTTA SEE them. I use those masterpieces as magnificent examples of surreal story telling wherein fiction blends with reality in an extremely suspenseful way. ""You were never really here"" comes close to those classics in sheer bewilderment and dream like storytelling. This movie is maybe NOT suited for popcorn lovers who want a straight action movie with a comprehensible storyline.This desorientating Lynn Ramsay movie is as serious, heavy and mindboggling strange as can be. You definitely wont feel cheery at all after seeing this, that much I can promise you.The story: Joaquin Phoenix plays a mentally deranged hired muscle who retrieves lost children that have been kidnapped. His latest job is to find the daughter of a senator. Will he find her? And at what cost? The trailer was really violent, which initially put me off. Couldnt imagine Joaquin Phoenix playing a stereotypical blunt hired muscle, because the man is such a refined quality actor. Blunt violence is usually reserved for the likes of dumb B-movie actors. But none of that cheap commercial blunt violence is to be seen in this movie, so I was mislead by the trailer. However the movie is very violent, BUT the violence is shown in a particular way I have seldom seen: often leaving out the actual act of violence itself, only showing the attempt at it. Very estranging, but in a fascinating claustrophobic way. It even makes the violence MORE terrifying when you do NOT see it. 
You just gotta see it yourself to believe it.I am still shaken by it. The movie only lasted 90 minutes. But it felt like an extremely intense thrilling ""trainwreck"" that lasted 90 minutes.

40,paul-allaer,Towering performance from Joaquin Phoenix,7,28 April 2018,"""You Were Never Really Here"" (2017 release from the UK; 90 min.) brings the story of Joe. As the movie opens, we see Joe cleaning a hotel room (for reasons unclear to us), and leaving through the emergency exit, setting off the alarm. Joe returns home, taking care of his elderly mom. Then Joe meets up with McCleary, who tell him that his next job is to rescue the trafficked teenage daughter of New York state senator Votto. All Joe has to go on is a street address... At this point we re 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Scottish writer-director Lynn Ramsay, whose previous movie was the excellent ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"". Here she adopts the book of the same name by Jonathan Ames for the big screen. I haven't read the book so I cannot comment whether the movie differs from the book in any way. What we see on the big screen is a gritty urban crime thriller the likes of which I haven't seen much recently, While the first half of the movie is fairly straight-forward (Joe on a mission to rescue the trafficked girl), the movie's second half is anything but (I shan't say more...), but the glue that keeps is all together is of course the towering performance from Joaquin Phoenix. He is big and bearded, looking much older than his real life age (43), and muscles his way through a number of tough scenes. One can't help but be transfixed by his presence from start to finish (Phoenix is in virtually every frame of the movie). Beware: this is a very intense movie, and not one for the faint at heart. Last but certainly not least, there is a delightful score by Jonny Greenwood, yes, the guitarist of Radiohead (on the heels of his Oscar-nominated--and very different style--score for ""The Phantom Thread).""You Were Never Really Here"" premiered at lat year's Cannes Film Festival to immediate acclaim, with Joaquin Phoenix winning the festival's Best Actor award. The movie opened last weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (5 people in total, including myself), and I really can't see this playing a long time in the theater. For that, the movie is too dark too and too gritty. But if you are in the mood for a dark and gritty crime thriller, you could do a lot worse than this. I encourage you to check out ""You Were Never Really Here"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",You Were Never Really Here

42,jtindahouse,So focused on its characters that it dismisses a potentially great story,6,2 October 2018,"I saw someone describe this movie as ""Taken if it were an arthouse film"". That's pretty apt I have to say. For me arthouse is very hit and miss, and more often miss than hit. It requires two things: the audience to ""get it"" and then for the audience to relate to it. Not always easy to pull off. But it's the reason why they are often very polarising films. 'You Were Never Really Here' found itself somewhere in the middle for me. I wanted to like it more than I did, but the film is its own worst enemy at times. It sets up a very interesting plot and then just as quickly completely dismisses it. I understand that they wanted the focus to be on the character, but surely the best films can juggle both. The film is very short at less than 90 minutes. This surprised me because usually these types of films like to take a bit of extra time to pad everything out. For that reason it does feel a little rushed (although I would still describe it as a slow-paced film for the most part).Joaquin Phoenix in the lead role was great. He always commits himself to a role and is fascinating to watch on screen. There are also some great suspense scenes and the violence in the film was handled very tastefully. I couldn't recommend this film to just anyone, most will know whether it is likely to be their sort of thing going in, but all I could say is there's a chance you will love it and an equal chance you will hate it.

However, it loses its way from the midway point. It fails, for me at least, to set up everything around Joe.I feel they needed to make the world and what Joe was entering come alive. There wasn't much emphasis on the bad people involved, we discover the main enemy as quickly as they leave. Obviously what's happening is atrocious, but it would've been better to get that feeling from the film itself as opposed to what we know about the subject matter in real life.",You Were Never Really Here
48,lukem-52760,A DARK & DISTURBING VIGILANTE DRAMA,8,24 January 2020,"Joaquin Phoenix is an extraordinary actor who totally becomes his characters as we know from the massive critical success of ""The Joker"" & here he gives another excellent & gripping performance as a very troubled & tormented ex-soldier turned hired Gun, basically a hit man who specialises in finding kidnapped girls, his name is Joe & he suffers mental issues due to have seen horrible stuff as a soldier & his own childhood abuse!!! Joe uses a hammer to beat the vile pedos to death & i loved it & totally agree with his actions as these monsters should be hunted down & killed.
Now this movie could've gone the Liam Neeson way of his ""Taken"" with lots of action & fighting but this story is on a much more smaller scale & more a personal emotional character drama with some disturbing flashbacks.
Professional killer Joe gets a job to go & rescue an under age who has been taken to a big house where vile pedos can pick a girl to abuse & Joe turns up with a hammer in a fantastically raw & brutal sequence seen from cctv cameras, once saved we find out there's more to this mission of his & the drama runs deeper.
I won't spoil anything or go on about, just watch a powerful piece of character driven Drama & Vigilante Thriller with an excellent, raw & powerful performance from the great Joaquin Phoenix.
Now it's not perfect or a masterpiece yet? As at times it is slow & very artsy & i would've preferred more brutal action but it's a good solid movie with a good music score.
Will probably become a Cult Classic.",You Were Never Really Here

Running a slim but fine 90 minutes, this film (as close to an American equivalent to Old Boy if there wasn't Spike Lee's Old Boy remake to contend with) feels more like violent think piece rather than a standard action yarn we're usually fed. W/dialogue to a minimum & characterization given through small dollops of flashbacks (his stint as a grunt wielded some heavy psychic damage), our anti-hero tries to maintain a positive face to his violent calling but when a politician engages his services to rescue a daughter from pedophiles lair, he finds himself in the middle of a double cross which causes the deaths of everyone near & dear to him w/only his past experience & his laser straight guidance to propel him towards saving himself, the girl & hopefully his soul.

52,peterp-450-298716,A film that really gets under your skin.,8,14 August 2018,"McCleary said you were brutal.
I can be.
I want you to hurt them.It's not just the fact that defenseless young children are victims of unscrupulous people who use them in networks for pedophiles. The most disgusting aspect of this is that these circuits are visited by people who occupy important positions in daily life. Individuals who show a respectable and neat appearance to the outside world. But once they show up in this nauseating business, their fortune is their entrance ticket so they can abuse these innocent children. Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) is someone who wants to set things straight. Armed with a heavy hammer, he beats those perverts from their victims. But ""You were never really here"" is not just about the existence of children's networks. The film also tries to paint a picture of the person Joe who is daily tormented by his own demons.Every time Joe gets on screen, you just feel that heavy burden on his shoulders. He's suicidal and exposes a murderous resentment. And this because of a youth full of violence, which is sporadically portrayed in haunting flashbacks. But also because of his war record. His scarred upper torso is probably caused by these events. And perhaps mentally there are even more profound wounds. Hence his fatalistic attitude. A ""Je mon fou"" posture which makes him walk into a lion's den without hesitation. And as a result, he also carries out life-threatening or self-mutilating actions. Pulling a plastic bag over your head isn't exactly something normal functioning people do on a regular basis. It's clear that PTSD also has something to do with this.Are you expecting to see explicit violence? You'll be slightly disappointed. Violence is abundantly present but is always kept out of the picture in a strategic way. There are a modest number of bloody scenes, but predominantly the violent and repulsive images are kept out of sight. But don't doubt it. Joe is an aggressive and insensitive (At least at that level) disposer of persons of poor moral character who'll split the skull of these persons in two without hesitation. However, his last intervention sets an influential mechanism in motion where he himself threatens to become a victim.Perhaps for some, it's a tad too arty and the speed of the film a bit too slow. Yet Lynne Ramsay knows how to make a stylistic revenge film. The entire film is filled with dreamy (almost hallucinatory) fragments and perfectly framed snapshots. A child's voice counting down softly. The sinking of a human body into the water. A close up of dripping wet hair. Joe staring into the distance. The biggest part of the film is also filmed in a dark and murky set-up. Probably as dark as the deformed and pained spirit of Joe. The interpretation by Joaquin Phoenix is breathtaking. Maybe rough around the edges, but deep inside a softy. A man without too many words, with a raw personality and with an impressive beard. As he strolls through New York, he looks like a homeless bum on his way to the soup kitchen at some community center. In reality, he's a man with a well-defined mission.""You were never really here"" certainly doesn't belong in the list of boring uniformity that's lately being produced in Hollywood. The film is more a character study than simply a revenge film. It's the kind of film that gets under your skin. I was a fan of Joaquin Phoenix anyway, but because of his undeniably fantastic acting performance in this film, he rises a bit more into the leading group of actors who are unmatchable in terms of acting.",You Were Never Really Here
53,aidanratesmovies,"Feels empty, but with some good performances",7,23 March 2019,"Joaquin Phoenix stands out in an otherwise dull and emotionless film about a man who finds peoples kids for money. The concept sounds more interesting than the film proves it to be, and it relies more on artsy film making rather than focusing on it being a work of art itself. Though the potential of the film can never be what it could have been, it does prove to be an interesting quest and pins us with some intriguing questions you may have never thought of before. Missed opportunity, maybe, but something new indeed.

55,EdgarST,Blow of the Hammer Man,5,18 February 2019,"«Blow of the Hammer Man» could be a good alternative title for this hyperviolent story about trafficking of adolescents in the upper echelons of power. A few months ago «La danza de las fieras» was released in Panama and it won the first prize at the BannabáFest Human Rights Film Festival. The Mexican film is comprised of six segments, three of which are about the same theme, told with better results and in less time. They also take place in everyday environments, among people that we see in the market, the church or the bank, but never imagine that they lead twisted lives. This approach does not divert attention from a generalized problem in all societies, in which women are the most frequent victims.
In the case of «You Were Never Really Here», the opposite occurs. The hit man who is involved in the trafficking case and tries to save the teenager who has been kidnapped penetrates the world of politicians. In his task, the tormented war veteran, who lives with his senile mother, becomes a sullen and brutal criminal who hammers left and right to cleanse the crime world of ugly people. What a task.
The director Lynne Ramsay, who received so much praise with the family drama «We Have to Talk About Kevin"", adapts the homonymous novel by Jonathan Ames and again refills the cracks of the story with fake blood. She also tries to clarify the facts with images of the murderous past of the killer, of his childhood abuse (perhaps sexually molested by his father too); of his participation in war and of the number of people he has killed. At times, the recourse reminded me of the repetitive flashback that was so effective in «Catch-22», whose plot always returns to Snowden's dying body in a bomber plane. With the difference, that in Mike Nichols' film, the reiteration has meaning and reason that shed light on the behavior of Yossarian, the escapist pilot.
Here the retrospective images only add more fuel to the fire, to the already singed figure of the assassin, played by Joaquín Phoenix. When he becomes a kind of Travis Bickle (the protagonist of «Taxi Driver»), in search of his own Lolita, the film does not recovers, not even with the (ridiculous) scene in which the murderer and a dying colleague, lying on the floor of the kitchen, begin to sing.

Starring Joaquin Phoenix, Judith Roberts, Ekaterina Samsonov, Alex Manette, Alessandro Nivolo, John Doman. (R)Bleak, brooding thriller is like a character study that can't be studied beyond a gnarl of pain festering just beneath dark eyes and bushy beard; barely-coherent flashbacks provide hints but nothing remotely tethered to a path for closure. Phoenix is a thuggish hired hand who utilizes a ball peen hammer and likes to rescue abused victims of trafficking. Scant narrative, even less dialogue, the film is primarily a series of movements and images committed to representing Phoenix's scarred psyche and volcanic purpose; slow-moving at times, especially in the early-going, self-indulgent even, with little to cling to besides the simmering but stunted lead performance. But those who are prepared for its lean but fierce gut-punch and have a willingness to coldly embrace an unconventional twist on the genre standard should appreciate its intense bite (truly ""liking"" it, however, may very well be impossible).69/100",You Were Never Really Here

He also is often driving a car without a given destination. Sometimes he is on bed. Soetimes he attacks other men or is attacked. There are not full dialogues or conversations.

This again proves you may be able to fool some of the people, some of the time. I'd suggest the producers, B.F.I., Amazon Studios, etc, would have lost considerable sums of money with this pretend movie. As this overly convoluted maze progresses it makes you wonder how Joaquin Phoenix and other cast, managed to keep a straight face (might have been interesting to have seen their faces while they read the script) There's a strong look as if the editor and director threw some footage in the air and spliced it together in the order it landed - then, attempted to copy Kubrick during one of his worst moments. In one scene, Phoenix jumps into a country lake and proceeds to endlessly sink into the deepest abyss (a-la Atlantic Ocean) who makes these foolish 'technical' decisions? The graphic violence (whether on or off screen) is as off-putting as the snail pacing and lack of worthy script - what sparse dialogue is uttered, is so poorly recorded and articulated most is unintelligible.Director/screenplay writer Lynne Ramsay has to shoulder much of the blame for this morbid failure to connect with a thinking audience - in preference to appealing to a nebulose, artsy bunch. While there may have been some stylish photography much of it looked like the operator forgot to turn off the camera between takes - with someone then thinking it looked so trendy they used it several times over.Mostly for those who want to read more into each scene than is articulated on screen or simply want to justify what they 'think' they understood, otherwise, a miserable experience that stretches its 85min R/T into tediously grotesque boredom and wastes a Phoenix performance.",You Were Never Really Here

I kept waiting for something to happen as the beginning of the film rolled past me like a horrifyingly boring catechism class. There is literally about six minutes of action in the entire film, the rest is tedious nonsense. Would it have killed the director to throw us a bone somewhere before the movie is one third of the way over? Flashbacks to nowhere, taking care of the old and feeble-minded, and lots of slowness, very slow. Someone needs to learn about pacing.When we finally get to the heart of the matter--and it takes forever and doesn't last long--the camera is third rate and the action is fuzzy because the director is trying to make some sort of art film from ultra-violence which is a little like playing classical music with a kazoo.Just because an actor is fat, hairy, and mumbles doesn't mean he's putting in a stellar performance: just because the viewer has no freaking idea of what is going on doesn't mean the director is doing something admirable. It's not that we're too stupid to understand what you're trying to say; it's that we don't care. Once again, a director seems to have forgotten that films are supposed to be entertainment.

But, plot twist: here, in 2018, we learn that he was Never Really Here! We've been living a lie; there's nothing inside!Director Lynne Ramsay's fourth film in nearly 20 years shows her increasingly on track to Terrence Malick territory - in more ways than her lugubrious output. You Were Never Really Here is a curiosity: on paper an action thriller (you can practically smell the schlocky Nicolas Cage B-movie romp a less ambitious director would've coughed out), but shot like an arthouse drama, complete with a pace so meditative it verges on somnambulant. Initially, it's a slog, as Ramsay takes us through the worrisomely overfamiliar stagnant misery of sad sack hitman Joe (Phoenix)'s life at a snail's pace. We try not to fidget and frown, as we wallow in déja-vu, as Ramsay's film doesn't so much as nod at Scorsese's Taxi Driver as stop just shy of having Joaquin monologue at a mirror. Yet, what starts as torpid quickly imperceptibly slides into crackling and hypnotic, as the content is buoyed and overpowered by Ramsay's deft telling. You Were Never Really Here is, unexpectedly, one of the most cinematically vibrant films of the year. Tom Townend's kinetically feverish, constantly askew cinematography trudges alongside Joe, sharing his dogged, bleary stupor with a grizzled, vividly dull aesthetic that suggests an Instagram filter of 'Bloodshot.' Jonny Greenwood's score perfectly accentuates the nerve-fraying fever pitch, a throbbing, fascinatingly disconcerting blend of Nine Inch Nails industrial belligerence, and mesmerizingly faux-peaceful Arcade Fire eeriness. Not much happens in Ramsay's film, but the editing ensures that you are damn well never ready for when it does. You Were Never Really Here festers in a maddening ambiguity between hallucination and reality (not helped by the fact that crucial members of the supporting cast look so similar it can be difficult to tell friend from foe, assailant from victim - a blurring that is likely accidental, but fascinatingly effective). Then, when least expected, it blindsides the viewer with gruelling PTSD flashbacks and bursts of creatively grisly violence, and scenes that linger, serenely still, only to violently swell and collide with the chaotic unpredictability of a surging sea. It's a punishing but rewarding watch, and, as flinty and disengaging as it can be, filled with moments of unexpected beauty and emotion - plus a beard mighty enough to make Travis Bickle's mohawk jealous. Still, as engrossing as Ramsay's cinematic trickery is, the film is unquestionably hung upon the slumped shoulders of Joaquin Phoenix, and he does it proud. Pumped up to the brawny, pudgy physicality of a sad bear and looking like he's been awake for years, and seen too many things along the while, Phoenix is an astonishingly physical actor, etching each ounce of Joe's trauma, defeat, and dogged, belligerent hope onto his leathery skin, and using each twitch and crinkle of his face to speak volumes with a nearly wordless script. He's in almost every scene of the movie, and seems to singlehandedly keep its heart beating, his hangdog anti-charisma propelled by an infectious, furious resolve. Similarly, Ekaterina Samsonov shines in her few scenes as an abductee who, increasingly, shares more with Joe than his silence, and Samsonov keeps her performance brittle but rock-steady, as, increasingly, the film's real beating heart. Doomed to always being billed as 'that one with the guy with the hammer - no, not Thor!', Ramsay's film takes its place as one of the most beguiling, sleepy sleeper hits of the year. You may struggle to stay invested or remember it, but fleeting moments - big and small, disturbing, beautiful, and disturbingly beautiful - will remain seared into your brain for ages to come. Though it may seem a flickering fever dream, I assure you: You Were Really Here. And your life is - curiously, grimly, and unexpectedly - better for it.-7/10",You Were Never Really Here

Every time this movie locked into that kind of story I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what Joaquin Phoenix would do next. He does a good job of playing the emotion of this character, and you are quick to get invested in his battle against those who oppose him. Perhaps the most poignant scene was when he returned to his mother's home later in the movie and had to deal with what went on there. That's when I was most locked into the emotions of this character.Sadly, the whole film did not engage me as well as some of those select scenes. You Were Never Really Here is a rather quiet film where you are supposed to fill in a lot of the gaps of the story based solely on minor flashbacks and odd behavior from the protagonist. I don't need my hand held through the story, but it just felt like there were a lot of vast empty spaces in the script that could have been used in order to develop the story and characters more, rather than sitting in silence.

70,maurice_yacowar,You Were Never Really Here - Review,10,21 April 2018,"The film is framed with montages of apparently overheard conversations, chat with no apparent purpose, theme or coherence. If there is meaning to that collection it is elusive, especially when so many phrases are indecipherable.
 That also describes the film, a powerful but elusive narrative centred on a compelling, damaged hero. Ex-GI Joe completes a mission to retrieve a senator's 13-year-old daughter Nina from sexual enslavement.
 But it's not quite a character study and it is too enigmatic for a clearly defined thriller. I'd call it an expression of the spirit of the age, especially as it references today's callous nexus of sexual and political exploitation in America. It's the perspective of Scottish writer/director Lynne Ramsay.
 A governor seeking re-election wastes many lives to recapture his favourite sex slave, the underage Nina. That corruption costs the lives of his supportive senator friend (Nina's father), along with Joe's boss, Joe's contact, Joe's frail mother and several incidental thugs. 
 While sensitively caring for his mother, Joe slips in and out of memories of his traumatic past, both as a Gulf War soldier and as the victim of an abusive father. His physical scars point to his psychological.
 His bare-chested scenes show Joe to be a massive physical presence, not muscular but bulky. His build is augmented by the bulk the beard gives the already intense Joaquin Phoenix. It leaves him virtually no face to read. Joe's physical bulk is the opposite to Nina's pre-pubescent frailty. 
 But they share a common absence. Paradoxically, the very physical Joe is ""never really here."" He is emotionally detached from his existence, paralyzed by the past traumas which he has attempted to flee in self-asphyxiation. Similarly, Nina retreats into the silence and removal of a drugged stupor so she is ""never really here"" either. Both Joe and Nina count backwards as if their retreat from consciousness were anesthetically induced. 
 Telling details abound. In a miniature of Joe's emotional confusion, he finds a green jelly-bean, his favourite, then crushes it. Buried in a lake, his mother's long white hair escape the bag and float elegantly underwater. To bury her, Joe - suit and all - fills his pockets with rocks to deliver her to the bottom of the lake. 
 The pedophile governor fingers the furnishings of a toy dollhouse, even setting in motion a rocker (like the one he's off?). His luxurious mansion has a classical painting of a seductive woman with one breast exposed. The classical art is a cover for male-centred pornography, as the exposed woman is a cover for his obsession with the flat-chested girl. 
 The violence is both ubiquitous and tempered. Most of Joe's assaults are off-camera or shown obliquely through a security system. But we see him rip out a painful tooth, bloodying himself. As they chat, his agent litters his desk with tissues bloodied from his nose. In this world breathing means blood. 
 In this lawless America the only police we see are the ones who steal Nina from Joe, killing the hotel manager and Joe's connections. The governor has the power to commit and to hide his corruption. An elected government official assumes he is above the law - and his officials support that warping. (It's only a movie. Right.)
 If the villainy is current America so is the trace of hope. The big macho hero doesn't save this day. The small abused teenage girl does. This is Me Too with a vengeance - and a political impact. After Joe entertains the despair of suicide, she returns trim and possessed and takes command: ""Let's go."" 
 The last shot is of the diner table Nina and Joe vacated. It's an image of calm, symmetry, a pallid assurance a world away from all the film's splattering. The victims have survived, escaped, saved themselves. As America yet may.",You Were Never Really Here
71,aciessi,Lynne Ramsay's Best Film,10,15 September 2020,"You Were Never Really Here is the inverse of Joker. Phoenix plays an unstable loaner who's reached his breaking point and explodes into violence. However, instead of using his mental collapse to spread chaos, the character here uses it as a force for good. He goes undercover to rescue underage girls held captive for sex trafficking. Joe is the classic unlikely hero, who's methods of doing good are ethically debatable. But just when you think you're on his side, Joe and the world around him begin to bend and hallucinate. By the film's end, we aren't sure what is reality or Joe's broken imagination. Has his vigilante conquest gotten the better of his mind? However you interpret it, You Were Never Really Here is a dark and nihilistic masterpiece. That's because it's helmed by Lynne Ramsay, the only person who could have handled this material properly. Since Ratcatcher, she's proved time and again that she can make a compelling and watchable story from the deepest recesses of our depraved reality. She revels in her unlikable protagonists and pushes the envelope as far as she can. Now that's a director. Give this woman her due!",You Were Never Really Here
72,rockman182,You Were Never Really Here (2018),7,7 April 2018,"This was actually my most hyped film of this weekend. Not familiar at all with Lynne Ramsay's filmography but was sucked in from the trailer. I'm a fan of Joaquin Phoenix and think although he's had ups and downs, he's always amazingly consistent and still underrated. Having now seen You Were Never Really Here, I will say that it meets expectations. The film is heavily boosted by its technical aspects and its strong lead performance.The film is about a man named Joe, a former war veteran with PTSD, who is hired to find a young girl who has been abducted. Once he digs into trying to find the girl he realizes that the girl is being trafficked, and that rescuing the girl is not as easy as it seems. This is because her kidnapping has ties to something bigger and more corrupt than what it initially seems. He must deal with the dangers that arise and his own mental health. The film also stars newcomer Ekaterina Samsonov, who plays Nina.Phoenix is typically great as is standard. The basis of the film is light and simple, however its delivered in a cold and unforgiving manner. There's a few grizzly moments in the film and the subject matter is dark. I think the editing of the film was excellent. There are rapid cuts throughout the film that flash back to Joe's past during war and the abuse he endured as a child. There are also cuts in scenes of the present day events, which adds a unique element to the presentation to the film.The film has slow and brooding moments but it always remains atmospheric. A discordant score also provides you with the perfect mood for the films plot. I also liked the sparse dialogue in the film and the varied cinematography that follow the lead's journey.

74,cultfilmfan,You Were Never Really Here,9,10 June 2018,"I definitely need to get caught up with Lynne Ramsay's body of work. I saw her first film, Ratcatcher back when they played it at my local university film series back in 2000 and even though it has been close to twenty years since I saw it, I still remember the film and the impact it had on me. The film was done in Scotland, but within the first few minutes you will notice that there are English subtitles throughout the film and you might be wondering why as I did myself at the time mainly thinking that a film spoken in the English language would have no need whatsoever for subtitles that would also be in English. Within a short while within the film you will see that the dialect and accents of the characters are so thick and they will often use some slang, which I guess is more familiar to the residents there than it was to my Canadian ears. The film also showcased and brought to attention the sometimes downright grimy and filthy conditions that the characters were living in as well as the poverty that went with it. In many ways, Ratcatcher was an eye opening film because of it's frank and sometimes startling look at these all young characters who are living in slum like conditions and trying to make something of themselves and I remember being slightly disturbed while watching it and yet at the same time I could not keep my eyes away from it and even at the most uncomfortable, or disturbing scenes, I still found it to be a rewarding experience and a film that I will probably always remember even if I do not ever have the chance of giving it a repeat viewing. Ramsay has done only a handful of films since this marevellous breakthrough motion picture and I hate to say it, but the only one I have seen since is this new film, You Were Never Really Here, which certainly has a lot going for it as well, so if and when I get the chance, or find how available her other work is, I will for sure have to pursue it because she is certainly a gifted filmmaker whose talent has not worn off from her initial first outing of Ratcatcher, just shy of twenty years ago. You Were Never Really Here, is a different film altogether and comparing this to Ratcatcher, would be the equivalent of comparing water and oil, but the one thing that is consistent is the style of both films and what Ramsay does as a director which certainly takes a story that could very easily have gone wrong had this project ended up in the wrong hands and she gives us a film that is not just a film to see and forget, but more than anything else it is an experience and one that will touch you on several different levels and the professionalism of Ramsay and how she accomplishes this is truly nothing short of amazing for the previous film and this one too. This is a film very much in key with how to make a film that certainly will target not only your senses, but your emotions as well. Whether it be to the opening few minutes with it's powerful and hypnotic music score to the dark night street scenes that evoke a sense of unease and yet mystery and intrigue all the same. This is a wonderful example of a film that has a lot of style and yet does not lose it's substance in the process. It has a lot to offer as a visual experience as well as giving your brain a good work out and leaving you with plenty to chew on after the film is over. The storytelling style steers away from anything remotely conventional which to me was a refreshingly different take, while others will definitely lose patience and most likely interest in the whole thing, but your filmgoing audience who is after something more substantial and a break from your usual Summer fare will be much rewarded for sticking with a film like this. The style of storytelling certainly is unique and at the same time it never gives us easy answers for what we are seeing and there are times when what we are seeing we are not sure are real, or not, or possibly just an illusion, or hallucination. I commend the film for giving us something to contemplate and reflect upon rather than being a sell out and trying to downplay everything to appeal to a wider audience. Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the lead character is in my opinion one of the best working actors today and his performance here is often quiet with few words spoken, but what he converys by body language and behaviour is so expressive and we can tell that this is a character with much pain and torment inside him and he is truly fascinating not only to watch, but to study as well. The cinematography is beautifully captured by giving us shots of sometimes brutal, or unpleasant things to look at, but it was truly one of this year's best shot and looking films which also goes to the overall style of the film that comes across right away. This is an unconventional film that certainly has a lot to offer from a very gifted filmmaker whose other work I need to get caught up on and a cast and crew who truly do their very best and the result is pure movie magic.",You Were Never Really Here
75,dave-mcclain,too derivative and odd to enjoy,2,8 May 2018,"""You Were Never Really Here"" (R, 1:29) is a drama-mystery-thriller which arrived in U.S. theaters in April 2018, following a series of European releases in late 2017 and a prestigious festival run in places like Cannes and Sundance. It's directed by Lynne Ramsay (""We Need to Talk About Kevin""), who also wrote the screenplay, adapting Jonathan Ames' 2013 novella of the same name. (Ramsay won the Best Screenplay award at the Cannes Film Festival.) The movie stars multiple Oscar nominee (and Golden Globe winner) Joaquin Phoenix whose work won him Best Actor at Cannes. Prestigious... but is it good? Joe (Phoenix) is a man with skills - and demons. He's a former FBI Agent and combat veteran with PTSD. He funnels his anger and uses his experiences in his self-appointed role as a savior of missing girls. But he doesn't just save the girls, he takes revenge on their captors. He's Batman, Dexter and Rambo all rolled into one. (The movie also feels like a combination of the ""Death Wish"" and ""John Wick"" movies.) When Joe is hired by a New York State Senator to track down his missing daughter, Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov), Joe finds himself fighting all the sex traffickers and corrupt politicians he can handle.""You Were Never Really Here"" is compelling, but too weird to enjoy. Joe seems just short of being a superhero, but not an appealing one. His cause may be just, but his excessive use of violence makes it hard to empathize with him. The choppy edits are also distracting. The film compares well with the aforementioned characters and franchises, but can't manage to be entertaining on any level. The comparisons with Robert De Niro's ""Taxi Driver"", are more fitting regarding subject matter and characterization than quality. Phoenix turns in another singular, raw, compelling performance, but he can't make the character sympathetic, and the excessively disturbing images only make things worse. Watching this movie is more difficult than worthwhile. ""C-""",You Were Never Really Here
76,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Story is about the life of two abused and tortured souls,9,20 February 2019,"The story is about the life of two abused and tortured souls revealed from opposite ages and genders. Both Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) and Ekaterina Samsonov character have been victimized by society. Joe bares the physical scars by his abusive father who wanted him to become a straight male by beating his homosexual preference out of him. Then there is Ekaterina who has been sold as an underage sex slave to the wealthy and powerful sexual deviants such as top politicians. Joe is still trapped by the mental cell his father has left him with. He takes on ""manly"" jobs such as a hired gun to support himself and his elderly Alzheimer afflicted mother who is completely unaware of what he does for a living.Joe is eventually hired by a wealthy man to find his kidnapped daughter and bring her back. But a twist in the film reveals he wasn't aware of the total circumstances behind her kidnapping. He finds himself being hunted.Joaquin Phoenix does what he always does best. He becomes the character to the point it no longer feels like we are watching an actor play a role in a film. He really wraps himself up in the character and provides a fabulous performance. He does the subtle nuances of a man in strong conflict with his himself and the image his father had tried to project on him. The film does have a slow pace, but that is intentional. Phoenix takes his time to develop the character very well on screen. This is his hallmark and what makes his film so great. He puts in the hard work to make us understand Joe. Unfortunately, many of today's instant gratification generation don't have the patience to experience real storytelling. I wish more actors took this art form to the heights that Joaquin Phoenix does. He is truly one of the best actors in Hollywood.",You Were Never Really Here
77,redrobin62-321-207311,Bizarre.,6,2 February 2020,"I think this is the first time I've used a one-word description for a film - bizarre. ""You Were Never Really Here"", a title that has nothing to to with the overall movie, definitely fits the bill. In essence, it's a crime drama/thriller, but it's delivery is so off-beat that it falls squarely in the experimental/surrealistic films category. If you want a straight forward narrative, ""You Were Never Really Here"" will disappoint. If you don't mind intermittent, or frequent, flashbacks and fake scenes, this film will fit that bill. It's easy to see why it didn't find an audience. Another word that comes to mind, by the way, is challenging, because that's what this Joachim Phoenix vehicle will do to you.",You Were Never Really Here
78,bob-the-movie-man,Joachim Phoenix delivers a standout performance in a violent tale of crusading.,9,27 July 2018,"Joachim Phoenix (""Her"") is a very intense actor, and fits perfectly here into the role f Joe. For he is a hired thug, available to do over anyone you think deserves dispatching or giving a good telling off. His weapon of choice for this task is a ball-point hammer, bought each time from a local hardware shop. He is a ghost, who drifts in and out of his jobs, face concealed by a hoodie and emanating an air of menace that automatically deflects enquiring eyes. When hired by a Senator (Alex Manette) to rescue his wayward daughter Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov) from the clutches of a paedophile gang, Joe delivers on the job with gusto, and - you sense - a degree of satisfaction. But then things go from bad to violent worse and Joe is drawn into a deadly high stakes game. As things get more and more personal, Joe embarks on a personal crusade for justice and retribution.The real joy of this film is that Joe is such a nuanced character. Yes, he's a brutal thug, but is still living with and loving his aged and demented mother (Judith Roberts), even though she drives him to distraction. He's also clearly damaged himself, with a high degree of OCD behavior exhibited. Via clever flashbacks, we get hints to the route that led the boy to become this damaged man. As a sociopath, when things go wrong he could just say ""F*** it"" and walk away. But he doesn't. Is this altruism? A sense of professional pride? Or is it the sight of a path to redemption? Although you could strongly argue that revence kicks in to reinforce his decision, Lynne Ramsay's screenplay leaves things deliciously vague. Ramsey also directs expertly: she previously did 2011's ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"".""I don't like gory films"" you might say ""so this doesn't sound like one for me"". Me neither, but actually, the trailer makes the film seem worse than it is. The violence is more alluded to than shown. Most of the ""hammer action"" is done either in long shot or seen on CCTV cameras, and you don't get to see much of the outcome. There is only one really gory bit that I remember (shut your eyes where Phoenix answers the knock at the hotel door if you are squeamish!). This doesn't mean that it's a comfortable watch though. It's an insanely tense film since you're not sure the direction it will go in next (think ""Get Out""), and it has more than its fair share of ""WTF"" moments, especially in a dramatic closing scene. There are some memorable cinematic moments as well: a young girl in a nightie in the paedophile den blankly observing Joe's handiwork being one that stays with you.It's a standout film, winning Best Actor (for Phoenix) and best screenplay (for Ramsey) at Cannes. It will be in a strong position to make my films of the year list. Highly recommended.",You Were Never Really Here
79,kjproulx,An Emotional Roller Coaster,9,24 May 2018,"Normally when I feel like recommending a movie to someone, it's due to the fact that I feel it will either appeal to a specific audience or just please everyone on a board scale. Quite honestly, although I'll be praising this film as I go along, I'm not quite sure who the audience will be for this movie. You Were Never Really Here is based on the novel of the same name and while I haven't read it, I believe this film is a nice representation of it, as it's simply a great film overall. Yes, the imagery is bizarre and the performances throughout the film may seem a little too realistic that they become off-putting, but these are all things that I found to be fascinating about it. If you're up to the task of watching a movie like this, here's why I think it's terrific.You Were Never Really Here follows a man in Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) as he is both haunted by his past and trying to straighten out his current life. Tasked with a job of looking for missing girls and taking down anyone in his path, this brings up memories that he's not too fond of. Told in a linear manner while also flashing back through weird visuals or direct scenes, this is a film that asks you to be entranced by it from start to finish. If you think imagery is just imagery when it comes to a director trying to express certain emotions through the camera, rather than dialogue, then this movie definitely isn't for you.Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent as Joe and quite frankly probably the best I've seen from him in years. From his subtle facial expression when a scene with his mother is taking place, to the very notion that he truly cares about everyone in his life, no matter how evil he may seem at times, Phoenix was able to present many emotions throughout the course of this movie. Not that I related to this character, but his thoughts on just wanting to do the right thing felt very relatable for many viewers to attach themselves to.From its visuals to its performances, I was blown away by this film, but this is where I draw the line of possible issues. You Were Never Really Here is the sort of film that gives you many amazing things, but also showcases a few too many depressing sequences and the visual storytelling gives you everything you need upon first viewing, at least in my opinion. This is a must watch movie in my eyes, but I can't see myself ever needing to revisit it. I also appreciate a film that's well-shot and well-edited, which is exactly what is provided throughout this movie, so that was an added bonus that had me applauding every few minutes.In the end, You Were Never Really Here is a fantastic piece of independent cinema and the perfect example of a movie that not enough people can get into or even come across, due to the overabundance of blockbusters in theatres these days. Whether or not you have read the source material that this film is based on, I highly recommend checking out this film if you can stomach a few brutal images, some very sad representations of the real world, and a huge wake up call throughout the final act that brought me to tears. You Were Never Really Here isn't for you unless you're into auteurist filmmaking like I am at times, but it's a great story to invest yourself in regardless, which is why when considering everyone, I think I nearly loved this movie.",You Were Never Really Here
80,kuarinofu,Artsy and pretentious,5,12 August 2018,"This is a very basic story (done in around 30 minutes) hidden behind an hour of pretentious visuals of walking, driving and staring. 
Noir elements were lacking, and it got really tedious after the first 30 minutes. It was obvious what was going to happen, but it took the movie a really long time to actually get there.
This movie always tried to look smarter than it actually was. This looks like a case when the creators thought they were very intellectual and the people watching wouldn't possibly be able to get that rich emotional phase the main character is going through so they felt the need to overload the movie with obvious symbolism which I'm sure they were taking very seriously.
They were probably just spilling their ego all over the place or they simply tried to make this look serious and complicated to make less experienced movie goers feel like there is something cool and important going on they don't understand and this means that the movie is very smart and cool.
It's not.

81,AhmedSpielberg99,This film is PERFECT!,8,9 April 2018,"Joaquin Phoenix gave such a powerhouse performance. He was the best choice to play the character of Joe who is devastated and traumatized but also very gritty and ruthless.The use of imagery is just incredibly magnificent. I really can't remember any filmmaker who used the allegory that good in maybe the last 5 years like Lynne Ramsay did in this movie. that was so clever and intelligent, and the most important thing is that I haven't felt the metaphors were stilted or something, they were very important to the character development and therefore the story itself; as this movie has a character-driven plot. The strange thing that it seems that the problem I have with this movie maybe has something to do with the use of imagery. I wanted to be more invested in the movie, and as I tend to dramatic themes, I think more engagement was required from me to be 100 percent interested in the characters and the story in such a film that relies heavily on imagery, especially with the slow pacing. That being said, sometimes the movie hit me right in the core of my heart and even almost made me cry! The cinematography and is mesmerizing and beautiful despite the dark atmosphere it has created, and Jonny Greenwood's score is captivating as usual, but the editing, especially the sound editing, is what makes this movie even more special; it is actually plays a vital role in the part of storytelling. I don't want to ruin anything for who haven't seen the movie yet, but all i can say is that the editing in this movie is a requisite tool, nay a technique!Here's something else great about this movie, it paid homages to Taxi Driver, Psycho, No Country for Old Men and maybe other movies, and I have never felt they were forced to the movie or something. Actually all these homages were professionally merged with the plot. (8.5/10)",You Were Never Really Here

Good thing that I forgot because I was able to rewatch and appreciate the darkness and lightness of this movie.This movie was so dark that it didn't have to try to add any music or anything special to confuse and terrify me. Every time Joaquin Phoenix leaned his head out to the train or tried to drop the knife on his leg, I became more unease. It was clear just how traumatized his character was, and the backstory on how he got to this point was mostly suggestive with some flash shots. However, that's enough to understand his character.Also just as dark was the main story that exposed the harshness of life, as well as showing another broken character that had seemingly brief interactions with Joaquin's character. Despite this, the movie still managed to show how people can impact each other, showing some light emerging from all the darkness.Overall, it's disturbing, yet somehow beautiful. 9/10.",You Were Never Really Here
83,RJBurke1942,A tormented veteran on a rampage to render justice?,7,29 April 2018,"Having been quite impressed by Lynne Ramsay's directorial effort with We Need To Talk About Kevin (2011), I watched this movie recently, expecting an equally stimulating viewing experience. I wasn't disappointed.While there have been many movies - too many to list - about mentally disturbed war veterans, this is the first one, I'm aware of, which bucks the trend: this veteran is, apparently, a hired killer, a hit man. And he doesn't use a gun; he just beats them to pulp with a ball-peen hammer. So, he's an equalizer for sure, and then some.But wait - this veteran has heart: his specialty is rescuing young women and girls from the depraved clutches of parents, families, pimps, drug and girl traffickers, you name 'em. It's all the same to Joe (Phoenix), a relentless killing machine in the flesh - unflinching, phlegmatic, unstoppable. Except in his dreams, which are nightmares every time they flash across the screen: war scenes, images of an abused boy (probably young Joe), an angry male (Joe's dad?) with a hammer, and many more, are intermittently repeated as Joe goes about his 'business'. It's all he can do, sometimes, to block them out, to get on with the job today: a daughter, Nina (Samsonov) of a powerful politician, is prisoner to a drug and pimp boss in the city. Joe is hired to get her out; and this time, he's ordered to hurt the bad guys bad ... real bad.Joe gets to the pimp's dive, quickly and brutally dispatches two security bozos, finds Nina, carries her out without any further resistance, takes her to his ""safe house"" - a quiet hotel. Next thing we see are two hit men - dressed up as NY cops - behind the janitor at the door, blood spatters all over Joe from the janitor, one killer grabs Nina while the other attacks Joe in a fight to the death....From that point on, the story then becomes an exercise in deciding what's really going on. Were those men real cops? Is Joe marked for a hit, and why? Who set Joe up? Why has his employer been hit also? And where is Nina? Most of all, a while later, why has his aging mother, for Pete's sake, with whom he's lived for years, been savagely shot through the eyeball? The horror and uncertainty just keeps getting worse, reminding this viewer of some David Lynch movies with their dense plotting and false trails. Add to that are some plot points that just don't add up, being impossible or illogical, especially for a hired killer like Joe. So, just where does reality start or even end in this outing?I can tell you, I was puzzled to the very last scene between Joe and Nina in a coffee shop. That seemed to offer a solution. Still uncertain, I decided to search through some of the reviews here and, eventually, I read one which confirmed my comparison with Lynch and provided additional insights to resolve, for me, the whole story. So, most of the foregoing you've just read is not the real story (although it is a compelling fantasy that can suck you in).To get to the nitty-gritty, and if you've already seen the movie, read the analysis by FrostyChud (FC) who rates the movie at 7. If you haven't seen YWNRH yet, be aware FC reveals everything, categorically; and I reckon it's the only solution that makes sense.Overall, it's clear Ramsay is developing into a director of real note. But, I think she has a way to go before she catches up to David Lynch. And while I think the editing in this movie is somewhat abrupt, and the spoken dialog often muffled and/or inaudible (but obviously both deliberate techniques for this story), it's still worth a solid seven out of ten.Recommended for mature adults only. And I look forward to more from Ms Lynne Ramsay.April 29th, 2018",You Were Never Really Here

To begin with Phoenix's character resembles an icy Liam Neeson 'Taken' character, but slowly we see flashbacks that imply he had an abused childhood, the character and story skilfully develop to only ever be implied. But not only brutal violence, Phoenix also shows some emotional, tender moments when highlighting scenes involving his mother.I like dialogue heavy films, but Phoenix gives an intense performance of a character with very little to say.

You really need to get used to Lynne Ramsey's style. I am a fan of her imaginary and the atmosphere she creates. I am not such a big fan of he unlinea artsy style. The story was extremely interesting and if the film had a bit more linear, it could have ranked among those character dramas such as Taxi Driver. Phoenix' Joe is such an interesting character and I had loved to see more of his past and what motivates him. Now of course I can sort of interpret it which is also interesting. But anyway, I know most love and adore Ramsay , and I really like her for the stories and characters she creates, I just would hope she would give them a more appealing depiction. 
But dont get me wrong, I really liked the film, the first half more than the second. Besides Joaquin Phoenix' Oscar worthy performance the film ha a great cinematography and a wonderful score by Johnny Greenwood.

93,ronakkotian,An unconventional way of telling this story,7,10 May 2020,"We Need To Talk About Kevin was one of my favourite films of 2011 and it clearly showed me Lynne Ramsay's talent. I don't like this film as much but its way of storytelling is admirable.You Were Never Really Here is about Joe, a man who tracks down missing girls and saves them.By hearing the plot, this film seems like a normal, basic story that's been done numerous times but it's nothing like how you'd expect. Lynne Ramsay's construction of a story like this is extremely unconventional and it won't be to everyone's liking. Some may call it pretentious and others will claim it's ""artsy-fartsy nonsense"". I found it to be a very creative way of showing a broken person's life.The presentation of this movie is fantastic. The atmosphere and tone is filled with darkness and despair. It leaves a disturbed and unsettled feeling within you. I love the ambiguity Lynne Ramsay left in many scenes of this film. Rather than having scenes explaining what's going on, it's great for the audience to try to piece things together and make our own judgement of what's taking place. I found it very interesting how the film focuses on the psychological parts of Joe. It helped me get a better grip on who he is and what he's gone through. The pacing will be the largest issue for people as it's very slow. Personally, there were times where the film paced too slow for my liking.Joaquin Phoenix gives us another powerful performance. It's a very nuanced portrayal of a man dealing with past trauma and Phoenix is completely convincing as Joe. The missing girl played by Ekaterina Samsonov could have been better in my opinion but everyone else did a great job.You Were Never Really Here was very unique. I loved the direction Ramsay took with this story and managed to make it very different in comparison to films with a similar story. I cannot wait to see what else she makes as I find her to be a very remarkable director.",You Were Never Really Here

Both films are about disillusioned war veterans, moving through the urban jungle, loathing the decadence of modern society, and rescuing a young girl from a brothel. Also, both films feature an aspiring politician during an election campaign. It's simply impossible to ignore so many similarities. But it's extremely difficult, not to say impossible, to make a film that can stand up to the iconic Scorsese classic.Joe, a silent war veteran played by Joaquin Phoenix, specializes in difficult operations like rescuing young girls who have run into trouble. So he doesn't hesitate when an influential politician asks him to search for his daughter. The man doesn't want to involve the police, because he fears for his reputation.Finding the girl turns out to be remarkably simple. But after having saved her by violently eliminating everyone standing in the way, things go wrong. There is more violence, more blood and more killing. In the end, Joe seems to emerge victoriously, but there is nothing to be happy about. 'Where do you want to go?', he asks the saved girl. 'I don't know', she says. 'I don't know either', is the desperate sounding answer.Lynn Ramsay explains Joe's state of mind by inserting lots of short flashes, sometimes almost subliminal. It adds to the general mood of darkness and looming danger. All kinds of unpleasant things are going on, but Joe nor the viewer know exactly what. The only way to deal with it, is with ruthless violence.But is this one man rescue mission enough to carry a whole film? I have my doubts. The first time Joe rescues the girl, the action is filmed in a very original way. We see everything happening through the images of the surveillance cameras in the building. This is exciting cinema. But at the end, Joe is filmed in a conventional way while slowly moving through a large villa, suspecting danger around every corner. This is a scene like so many similar scenes from other movies.After leaving the cinema, I felt I had seen a bit too much violence and too little storytelling. But without doubt, this is a personal feeling: perhaps the lack of story elements is what makes this film stand out from others.",You Were Never Really Here
95,davidgee,No stranger to violence - or Weirdness,6,23 March 2018,"Directed and scripted by Lynne Ramsay, no stranger to weirdness (she brought us WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN a few years ago), this film is disturbingly shot: extreme close-ups and low-angles on noisy streets and murky corridors. The soundtrack is a mix of teeny-bopper pop-songs and traffic noise. Joe has flashbacks to a violent childhood of his own and scenes of carnage from his military service (was this Vietnam or Afghanistan?)Joaquin Phoenix, looking and acting disturbingly like Dennis Hopper in one of his more psychotic roles, is the key to the movie, but I have to say I was really never sure what the point was. A paedophile sex-ring in high places was hinted at, but in the end it came over more as just another kidnap movie, albeit at a deeper and darker level than Lian Neeson's adventures in the same arena.",You Were Never Really Here
96,andrewroy-04316,"Ramsay and Phoenix are a wonderful match in this tense, if not completely satisfying, gritty thriller",7,23 September 2018,"Lynne Ramsay and Joaquin Phoenix are both people who give their all to each movie they are a part of, and bring thoughtfulness and originality to each, so to see them paired up was extremely enjoyable. The comparisons to Taxi Driver are apt, as the success of each rests in the psychologically complex protagonist struggling with the world around him. Phoenix brings the depth you would expect to this performance, and Ramsay has great success with gradually showing you what's going on in Joe's mind. At its core, You Were Never Really here is a movie about trauma, primarily with Joe and his ability to complete his tasks despite the vast trauma in his mind, but also Nina's trauma. The plot elements work well, as they did in Ames' novella, and Ramsay of course nails the dark tone caused by filtering everything through Joe's point of view. The scene that completely blew me away was the scene in the water - the cinematography was absolutely gorgeous, and seeing Joe's thought progression in letting his mother go and preparing to go himself, and then seeing a girl needing his help and coming back to the surface, was moving and brilliant. 
The big thing that kept this from being a movie I loved was the ending. What I had come to appreciate as the single thing that separates Ramsay from all other filmmakers (in addition to the dialogue-light, artistic, character-driven style that is also evident in all 4 films) is her ability to emotionally tie up the plot and characters in her endings, as well as bring back some larger theme as a takeaway. The ending here was fine, but it just felt like another part of Joe's story and didn't really confront the things he had been struggling with. Joe was never really challenged in person, and was just figuring out what was going on and then physically doing whatever it takes to save Nina. The flashback shots throughout the movie were brilliant, but I wanted more closure and a clear thematic message in the ending. Instead, we get a neutral ending with Joe and Nina figuring out what they'll do next. Not a problematic ending, but also not one that impacts the viewer the way her last 3 endings certainly did, and it kept the movie from having larger overall emotional weight. 
Ramsay and Phoenix certainly don't disappoint in bringing intensity and intelligence as you would expect from them, but the film doesn't provide much more than a well-done gritty tone and a good character study focused on trauma.",You Were Never Really Here

98,bgar-80932,Really wanted to like it,3,20 November 2018,When I saw the trailer I thought this was going to blow me away. It didn't. The plots great and everything but just the way it's filmed doesn't really fit. Phoenix is a veteran with PTSD seemingly from war and his youth. Flashbacks keep showing I assume his father abusing him and his family. He has a lot of suicidal tendencies but he's taking care of his elderly mom and I think that's why he didn't do it. In the meantime he helps find missing girl by any means necessary. He takes up a case where way too young girls are being used in a brothel and things go awry after he takes her away. The rest of it is him trying to get her back basically. Sounds like something I'd love especially with Joaquin Phoenix in it but for whatever reason it didn't really work for me.,You Were Never Really Here
99,PyroSikTh,A Story of Trauma Encased in a Plot of Brutality,9,14 March 2019,"You Were Never Really Here is a slow and meandering film, and its lure is not in its story, but in its main character and his experiences, and how they shape him as a person. Joe is an abused child, an Afghanistan war veteran, and an ex-FBI agent who now earns his way by saving young girls. He's spent a life watching women around him get mistreated, beaten, and murdered, and he takes it upon himself as an anti-hero vigilante to fix the wrongs he sees in the world. But this is no superhero tale. Joe is deeply traumatised, and everything he does is to drown out the PTSD flashbacks he suffers from. He's morbidly depressed, alcoholic, and addicted to violence.But You Were Never Really Here does a couple of things to stand out from the clichés of the violent vigilante genre. First and foremost is it never actually shows the violence, at last not in graphic detail. The focus is on the preparation and the aftermath. We see Joe study his targets and plan his assault, we see him purchase gaffer tape and a new hammer for every job, and we see bodies lining the floor in pools of blood after he's done. Even when he wields a gun, his targets are off-screen when he pulls the trigger. Secondly it makes a real effort to truly humanise Joe. The first act solidly establishes him as a mummy's boy, caring for his decrepit mother as she slowly grows senile and frail. They share a charming relationship that's hard not to be endeared into, reminiscent of a real mother-son relationship. There's also a moment later in the movie where Joe comforts a dying hitman, lying next to him, singing with him, and holding his hand as he passes on. Anger and vengeance make way for sympathy and kindness in a heartbeat.The movie is as much about who Joe is as it is what he does. He is deeply haunted by his PTSD, and it takes every opportunity to disrupt his everyday life. Taking a picture of a group of teenage girls on the street reminds him of a lorry full of corpses he uncovered working with the FBI, and every quiet moment he gets is punctured by flashbacks to his father's abuse or the death of an Afghan girl during his service. Amongst the usual coping mechanisms, he finds comfort and safety in auto-asphyxiation, damp towels over his face, and knife-play, showing us how truly broken a man he really is. In the film's closing and most powerful moments, he finds himself surrounded by people oblivious to his troubles and the horrors around them, imagining himself committing suicide and no-one even noticing.While the story is a little unoriginal (uncovering a grand conspiracy of wealthy white men taking advantage of underage girls), the way it's shot and edited together is entirely captivating. I've already mentioned how the violence is barely ever shown, but the one time it is, it's through black-and-white CCTV footage, concealing much of the graphic violence that occurs. His PTSD struggles are filmed close-up in claustrophobic framing of his face, and cuts are sometimes jarring and sudden making the film unpredictable to watch, but also showing how fractured Joe's mind is. Some scenes are just beautiful as well, like Joe sinking in the water, or the use of mirrors and shifting focus to force your eyes to certain places on the screen.The other big ingredient to this is the exquisite sound design. Silence becomes deafening at various points, amping up the tension uncontrollably, while other sequences are drowned in ambiance so much that they become overwhelming. The use of background voiceovers does a huge amount to establish what's going on in character's heads without being cheesy. Usually it's a simple countdown to help focus, calm nerves, and deal with trauma, but sometimes it's conversations around them, or memories resurfacing in sound. Some important points even happen off-screen in the sound design. And this is without mentioning Jonny Greenwood's fantastic score that's both unsettling, endearing, and heart-pumping. He uses a marriage of orchestra, synthesisers, and a dash of electric guitar to conjure all the emotional cues of the film, but is never overbearing enough to take away from the movie's own sound design. The sound and score work perfectly together in harmony.Finally, Joaquin Phoenix is spectacular. He's always played the quiet guy really well, letting emotions and motivations simmer under the surface, and Joe is no exception to his other great performances. He's a broken man to his core and it's hard not to empathise with the sheer pain he goes through every day. There's one scene in particular at the end when he finds his target already dead, and he goes through a bit of a mental breakdown, either through being robbed of vengeance himself, or through the realisation that he wasn't really needed in that situation after all. While the book's title was in reference to Joe's methods on the job, ensuring he never left a trace, the film instead applies that title to Joe's mental state of mind. The world goes on around him as if he was never really there. Everyone around him is so wrapped up in their own lives that they don't pay Joe any mind at all, as if he wasn't there. And ultimately he finds he wasn't the saviour Nina needed after all, as things turn out reasonably fine without him. He is a void, a black hole, an absence in his own life.You Were Never Really Here is a flat-out fantastic film, no doubt about it, but it's not one I would recommend blindly. It's slow, and requires a little piecing together, but is extremely well-made. The sound design, the score, the cinematography, the editing, they all come together in this perfect little package harmonising and supporting each other. Joaquin Phoenix offers the performance of a lifetime, and the character he's given offers so much scope and freedom. The choice to shy away from the violence was inspiring, and oddly made the aftermath so much more important and powerful. I give You Were Never Really Here a very, very solid 9/10.",You Were Never Really Here
100,jordan2240,Kind of wish I hadn't been there while this was playing,5,7 November 2018,"Watched this because of Phoenix. He usually plays some oddball or psycho, and is at least interesting to watch. Wasn't disappointed in that respect, but the movie itself never presented what we (the wife and I) could glean as motive for anything that happened. No idea why the government (or so it seemed) came after the main character or the girl. Not even sure if the Senator and Governor characters were the same person (i.e. was the Governor impersonating the Senator when he sent 'Joe' after the girl) or not. Very little development as to why 'Joe' was so messed up and whether or not the girl was involved in a sex ring or was specifically sought after. And why did so many of the characters associated with Joe have to be killed?If you find this review confusing, don't even bother with the film. Not satisfying in the least.",You Were Never Really Here
101,ethanbresnett,An extremely well executed dark thriller,8,20 June 2020,"You Were Never Really Here is dark, disturbing and sombre tale. Telling the story of Joe, a former soldier who now works for hire, teetering on the edge of existence. The plot is very contained, taking place over only several days, in a small geographical span, and with very few characters. It is also contained in it's length. With only a 90 minute runtime, You Were Never Really Here zips along with the pace of a thriller, but also delivers the emotional impact and catharsis of an epic. The fact that it manages to deliver this impact with such a limited and minimalist script is a testament to the performance of Phoenix.You Were Never Really Here truly demonstrates how talented Joaquin Phoenix is. In a film of so few words, his performance had to be absolutely spot on for this to work. Unsurprisingly his performance was sublime, with so much pain, torment, defeat and anguish coming through in his portrayal of Joe. It was a truly haunting performance which will leave you transfixed. I'm struggling to think of an actor working today who can perform with such gripping intensity as Phoenix, I couldn't imagine anybody else embodying this character.What I also liked about this film was how, despite the violence at its core, it was never gratuitous. You Were Never Really Here displays its violence in a semi-hidden way, never detracting from the ultimate message as its core, which isn't one of violence. Despite the content and actions of Joe this is a tale of internal pain and suffering rather than violence and retribution.Lynne Ramsay's direction of this film was beautiful. It was so considered and thoughtful in many ways, presenting a truly sombre and tragic protagonist. There were some fantastic tracking shots, lots of creative camera work and angles, and some great set design in enclosed spaces.You Were Never Really here is a must watch for film buffs. While it might not garner mass market appeal, its a film with so much to take away, remarkable really for its 90 minute runtime.",You Were Never Really Here

103,david-meldrum,A Haunting And Brilliant Film From One Of Modern Cinema's Most Essential Voices,9,12 June 2019,"A strange, brutal, brilliant and beautiful (yes, all of those at the same time) from British director Lynne Ramsey. Whereas her brilliant We Need To Talk About Kevin looked at the issue of violence - in that case, a school-shooting style atrocity - from the point of view of the mother of the perpetrator, this film tells a rather different story. Joaquin Phoenix is predictably superb as a troubled army veteran who specialises in rescuing girls from sex trafficking and isn't afraid to be especially brutal in doing so. The story - taken from a novella - centres on one job he takes on that soon spins out of his control with worrying implications for him. This is a man whose past trauma leads to him toying with self-harm even while he stands outside his ageing mother's bathroom whilst she showers; even so, he is not without tenderness. There is a real bond between him and his mother, with whom he lives; even if we're troubled in a film this cine-literate to find several unhidden references to Psycho in the portrayal of that relationship.There is much that is brilliant here: the sparse, precise script; the disorienting cinematography and sound design forcing us to continually question what's real; Jonny Greenwood's remarkable score. The film constantly references other sources - classic movies or a variety of genre tropes, but frequently subverts them. It's a short film, but one during which the viewer is never sure of her footing, never quite able to rely on anything for a reliable point of reference, right up to the strange ending which doesn't quite work. That ending is a small and rare weak point, though. As a film which is centrally concerned with memory and the aftermath of violence as opposed to the violent act itself, this is a haunting and brilliant film from one of modern cinema's most essential voices.",You Were Never Really Here
104,stevenrotherforth,No bells and whistles needed here!,6,15 November 2018,"You Were Never Really HereLynne Ramsay's film about a traumatised gun for hire who gets well in over his head is a movie that burns slowly.
Perhaps too slowly for some.
A film that is carried by fine direction and a supreme performance by Joaquin Phoenix as hired gun Joe.
There's certainly no bells and whistles on Ramsay's picture.
A grounded movie that portrays violence in its most simplistic form.
Joe is a ticking time bomb.
A troubled man trying to put things right the only way he knows how. Usually with a Ball-peen hammer!
As a character in the film asks ""They said you are brutal!""
To which Joe softly answers ""I can be.""
This is no 'Taken' or any other hyped up but poorly executed Actioner that Hollywood usually churns out these days.
This is a strongly driven character piece.
A film that doesn't rely on dialogue. Phoenix conveys the torture of a troubled man with pure body language.
This makes his character much more frightening than any of the cardboard cutout heroes of today's bland action movies.
Violence is handled expertly. Much of it off camera but this makes it no more less effective.As I mentioned earlier this film may be a little too slow for some. But if you can relish in the performances and the Psychotic soundtrack, then there's much to write home about here.
Ramsay has delivered a film that isn't really comparable to anything else out there.
For that it must be commended. The hardcore action fan will want more from this movie but it isn't trying to be that type of film.

107,bob_meg,"Brutal, jaw-dropping, yet artfully made with only the grit Ramsay could bring",10,26 January 2020,"You Were Never Really Here is a challenging movie, almost completely non-verbal in it's execution. It gleefully dumps the job of piecing together Joaquin Phoenix's backstory and a number of other outlandish, unsettling details of the plot, a plot that gets sicker and more twisted (and thanks to Ramsay's spartan touch, more compelling) by the minute.YWNRH's 90 minute runtime works to it's advantage, ripping open it's tawdry underbelly in such devastating fashion that you are overwhelmed much like Phoenix's character, an ordinary ""Joe"" who exploits his own abused past with the efficacy of a laser as a for-hire assassin working for a Fixer of dubious background. Joe doesn't really know or *want* to know much about why he's suddenly summoned to a senator's home to retrieve his underage daughter from the clutches of a posh east-side townhouse where pedophilia and bondage occur on a daily business at the behest of a variety of walk-in sleazebag clientele. But there's something vaguely ""off"" about Senator Vollo's request --- credit actor Alex Manette's brief yet ominous near-cameo.You get that verification when halfway into the movie, Phoenix achieves his goal with startling ease in a series of close-circuit camera shots with only Rosie and The Originals' 1960 classic ""Angel Baby"" playing in repeat on the soundtrack (try listening to that without cringing in the future) . It's at this point that lesser directors and actors would simply abandon ship and allow the film to devolve into a soulless bloodbath, but instead Ramsay and company go in for the choke, diving deeper and deeper into its cast of complex characters, forcing you to go where they do, in real time, to try and make sense of the senseless horror.In the second half of the film, you get scenes that should be pathetic howlers, as when Phoenix and one of his foes lie exhausted on a kitchen floor mumbling along with Charlene's ripe 1982 pop platter ""Never Been To Me"". It shouldn't work, but because of the insurmountable situation, you can taste both characters longing for all the madness to disappear, even for a minute.Ramsay's films have always been about making you analyze the nature and root of intrinsic evil --- We Need To Talk About Kevin was just as compelling and squirm-inducing --- and demand actors whose forte it is to communicate tomes without saying much, if anything. YWNRH is an awesome compliment to Phoenix's career tour-de-force in Todd Phillip's ""Joker"", another superb character study approached from a polar opposite, even extroverted standpoint, to equally shattering effect. Phoenix might be about 80 pounds heavier here, but the heft he's adding is way more than dead weight.Yes, this film is not exactly air-tight but it doesn't need to be. Ramsay's crack pacing and Phoenix's engulfing performance negate much of that, along with a sound mix that could be more clear at times (I was switching to subtitles more than once), but it's an unforgettable experience, one I'd gladly take again soon.",You Were Never Really Here
108,markgorman,Phoenix's best yet. Lynne Ramsay provides a directing master-class.,10,20 March 2018,"First. A gripe. Why does everyone (reviewers, pundits, friends) call Joaquin Phoenix, Joaquim, with an M. That's not his name.It's important, because he is.He is about to assume a place at the altar of greatness, and this is the start of it, thanks to the high priestess of film making, Lynne Ramsay.I have followed Ramsay's career with close interest given that she is Scottish and I was privileged enough to be invited to the world premiere of her debut, Ratcatcher in 1999.That particular movie met with dismay with one of my fellow guests, the Marketing Director of VisitScotland, who was despairing of the Scots' film industry's penchance to make depressing (his word) movies about my home country, and his product.The journey has had few stops in the intervening 19 years. A movie every half decade has not make her a household name. But if you care even a jot about cinema she must feature high in your list of the greatest living directors. Every frame she has committed to celluloid is crafted perfectly and Morvern Callar (an astounding book given a 10/10 treatment by Ramsay), We need to talk about Keven (ditto) and the aforementioned Ratcatcher (her own original screenplay) are all simply great movies.Every single one of her films (and two short films) have been recognised at Cannes - reflecting her status as auteur in the cinematic world.You Were Never Really Here is no exception, nominated for the Palm D'or, it is a continuation of Ramsay's faultless performance. What will catch the headlines (small as they may be) though, will be Pheonix's performance, as Joe. It's highly redolent of Javier Bardem's in the Coen Brothers' magnificent No Country for Old Men in which they both play mysterious hitmen with little to say.His pursuit of justice for the young victims of a New York paedophile circle is cold blooded. Some of the extremely violent acts of retribution captured in this would turn your stomach were they committed to screen, but Ramsay opts instead to deliver them via a series of quite original set ups (for instance on CCTV) or chooses instead to share the aftermath and not the moment (think Tarantino in Reservoir Dogs in which you think you see, but don't, the ear removal to Steeler's Wheel, never to be the same, Stuck in the Middle.)Phoenix is frankly, awesome in this. His, often topless, performance reveals an ageing body, moobs and all, that tells a million stories. The scars, bruises and lumps are each the souvenir of some untold act of revenge in which he escaped less than Scot-free.His back story is told in tiny scraps. Clearly he suffered an abused childhood, protected by his still living, and loving, ageing mother. The trauma has shaped his career and although the back-story is never revealed in detail, only suggestion, we get the point that it has traumatised him so much that he often has to breathe into polythene bags, covering his head, to replace his panic-attack-driven hyperventilation with a dose of CO2. The auto suffocation this suggests is not so. It's his way of coping. Of living.The narrative of the story revolves around the rescue of a New York Governor's abducted daughter - the beautiful Ekaterina Samson (Nina), whom he rescues from a Chelsea apartment in a trail of blood. Stupefied with drugs, she has little more to contribute to the proceedings than Phoenix, and this becomes the start of a gig that's about to go awry.Really, the story is not that important. We get it, but it's tricky to follow as it pursues a complex narrative (not that there's much spoken dialogue) structure.What matters is that Phoenix's delivery from his personal hell is increasingly tied to Nina's own safety. His mother too (a lovely performance by Judith Roberts) features heavily in the plot as she appears to be the only real love in the callous Joe's life.Ramsay has delivered yet another perfect movie. Hideous, beautiful, cold but engaging. She might not be box office gold, but she'll keep her fans baying for more.Roll on 2023.",You Were Never Really Here
109,W011y4m5,Fantastic,8,3 April 2019,"Lynne Ramsay somehow manages to create a very brutal & dark, deeply disturbing & uncomfortable film with genuinely surprising moments of pure beauty & tenderness; it's a masterfully & meticulously crafted film - as you'd come to expect with her at the helm - that feels like a mature & grounded take on an action genre movie (or a deconstruction) like John Wick for instance - but without the sensationalism of graphic violence; it's not stylised or choreographed to be aesthetically impressive but is instead shot & edited in an incredibly effective & simplistic manner which makes each punch feel like it hurts when it lands upon watching...
For her to have found & included profoundly moving sequences in scenes which would have otherwise been unoriginal is testament to Ramsay's talents - both providing deeper meaning & humanity at times when it felt as though it had been temporarily lost or forgotten & also subverting expectations.
The cinematography is impressive yet understated, as is the lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix.
All of these things culminate to create a brilliantly / competently shot & executed final product that makes for a rewarding viewing experience. It's not a masterpiece but it is undoubtedly worthy of admiration.",You Were Never Really Here
110,dr_clarke_2,Ramsay's astonishing direction is matched by a brilliant performance from Phoenix,10,26 September 2021,"You Were Never Really Here is Lynne Ramsay's 2017 adaptation of Jonathan Ames' novella about a traumatised mercenary who specialises in finding trafficked girls and is hired to find and rescue a politician's kidnapped daughter with bloody consequences. On the surface, it sounds like just another psychological action thriller, but in the hands of Ramsay - director of Ratcatcher, Morvern Callar and We Need to Talk About Kevin - and with a blistering lead performance from Joaquin Phoenix, it turns into something very special indeed.Ramsay adapted the novella and in keeping with her previous films it is light on dialogue, with the story instead unfolding through the visuals and the actions of the characters; thus, the opening scene tells us a great deal about Joe before he even utters a word. Joe succeeds in rescuing teenage Nina from a brothel, but she is soon taken from him when it turns out that she is the favourite underage prostitute of a New York City Governor Williams, who sends men to kill both Joe and his loved ones. This sounds like familiar film territory, but Ramsay's idiosyncratic style means it doesn't unfold quite like that. Usually, when violence occurs, we see it but don't hear it, as music or news reports play over the top. Ramsay shows Joe's rescue of Nina from the brothel via security camera footage. Later, there's a remarkable scene in which Joe fatally wounds one of the men who killed his mother and then lies beside him on the kitchen floor, listening to music with him as he slowly dies.Having decamped to the USA, Scottish director Ramsay shot the film and around New York City, where the story is set. The film shows New York City at its most seedy and grim, a world of child prostitutes and corrupt police and politicians, and Ramsay works with cinematographer Thomas Townsend to get menace from lingering shots of a hammer and close-ups that speak volumes about Joe's state of mind. The film's visuals create a dream-like, disturbing quality obviously designed to reflect Joe's detachment from a world with which his only occasionally and brutally interacts. The mood is further enhanced by the score composed by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood (a frequent collaborator of Ramsay's fellow visionary directory Paul Thomas Anderson); it is dramatic but slightly discordant, creating a nerve-jangling air of constant, pulsing tension.The result is a paradoxically beautiful film about a very ugly world. Ramsay's skill as a director is matched by Phoenix's skill as an actor: he is almost unrecognisable as the scruffy, mumbling Joe, who is troubled by flashbacks to a dark past and occasionally suicidal. Phoenix is utterly convincing as a man who loves his mum but who has built a reputation for brutality in his work, as demonstrated by the fact that his weapon of choice during the raid on the brothel is not a gun but the aforementioned hammer. The other cast members appear but briefly, with the exception of Ekaterina Samsonov, who gives an impressive performance as Nina, a victim who ultimately proves capable of defending herself without Joe's help when she slashes Williams' throat and the calmly eats a meal. The final scene, in which Joe briefly fantasises about committing suicide in a diner before Nina tells him that it is a beautiful day, suggests that it may be her who has saved him, rather than the other way around.Lynne Ramsay is one of the best directors of her generation and it is shame that she hasn't been more prolific. Nevertheless, her body of work to date is impressive and You Were Never Really Here is a perfect example of her talents.",You Were Never Really Here

He gets the poop beat out of him but is running and jumping in the next scene. Laws are broken and guns are fired but no cops in this city I guess. Really, just a sad, confused little movie that the critics will love because it makes no sense, so it's ""

114,kaptenvideo-89875,"It's dark and artistic, but is it great? Its up for discussion...",6,6 May 2018,"Here's little something for artsy thriller crowd, if there even is such a particular audience. I hope there is, because ""You Were Never Really Here"" feels special, even if it doesn't reach the level of quality the creative forces behind the project surely had in mind.Lynne Ramsay (the director-screenwriter) and Jonathan Ames (screenwriter and the author of the original novella) have not tried to be our friends to help one understand what's going on here.The central character and his journey can best be described in ambiguous terms, leaving most up to the viewer to interpret.I would only say that in the beginning we have a loner with a shady past (Joaquin Phoenix) who tracks down missing underage girls for a living.From here... they don't offer much in the way of explanations, storytelling or even dialogue for that matter. There are only hints, including flashbacks, and heavy atmosphere hanging over everything like a death cloth.Following the events may produce a variety of reactions in audience, from fascination to boredom. Which is probably the best an artsy movie can aspire to.The morbid atmosphere is actually the movie's biggest strength, and Phoenix can be thanked for its success (not that I'd expect less from this serious method actor).Yes, the director has been too much invested in showing how cool and tormented Phoenix looks, which makes the story feel lethargic during the first third (or at least 30 minutes).But there's no denying that he's given his best as a mysterious loner, coming across as both creepy and sympathy-arousing - all tormented and on the verge of breaking down for reasons left largely unexplained.Who is he, really, and what personal hell is he going through? There are probably comparisions to made to modern classics such as ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Ghost Dog""...You'll probably be intrigued enough to at least want to search possible meanings online. For this, I'd heartily recommend FrostyChud's user review at IMDb.com who offers something resembling Freudian interpretation of the movie.Shortly, it sure is artsy, dark and violent. It probably wouldn't sit well with a person looking for just some entertainment. Joaquin Phoenix doesn't really ""do"" regular movies anymore, he seems to only appear in intellectual or vanity projects now. ""You Were..."" is both, but leans more to the vanity side if you ask me.""You Were Never Really Here"" has enough good stuff to keep one invested but it doesn't quite form a satisfying whole. Some more action or just proper storytelling would probably shake up the stylish but lethargic approach.BTW, the same director made 2011's great ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"", which is also dark and artsy.",You Were Never Really Here
115,WalkdenEntertainment,"Don't wait to see Joker, Joaquin already brought his ""A"" game!",8,14 November 2018,"Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) is a man you hire to track down missing people. Joe is also a skilled ex veteran who is permanently traumatised by his dark past. When Joe works, he walks around with confidence and has no problems using violence in order to get the job done. After getting the job done and collecting his pay, Joe comes home to his elderly mother who he takes care of.After completing a recent job, Joe is soon offered a new mission from a New York senator. The mission is to find and rescue the Senator's 13 year old daughter who may have been captured.I enjoyed the fact that Joe as a character is no 007. It's clear that while he is skilled, he's also a man with a horrible past, but in the end... he is very capable for any task. To the audience, we feel Joe does what he does to distracts himself or perhaps occupy to his thoughts from dwelling on his own personal hell.The film is loaded with tension, but to my surprise it's also all shot beautifully. When Joe is on a mission, we don't do see the smashing and bashing. The director here gives us enough understanding to know what Joe is doing each step of the way without needing to show us every single detail. Other scenes are filmed creatively, allowing us to see Joe's mind and thoughts. These scenes can come across like a dream sequence and viewers might possibly find this slow and boring. Others may lock into what we see of Joe's world and be thankful for how much we get to see of his personal life. For me personally, I loved how creative this film was. Showing different camera angles and Joe's mind in depth only helped me to gain greater understanding of the situation and the characters. Naturally it's these types of moments that also build the suspense!From a performance level I loved Joaquin Phoenix. While I understand the actor has kept himself busy on screen, I personally enjoyed his work here more than anything else I've seen of him recently. The actress of the 13 year old victim (actress Ekaterina Samsonov) also acts incredibly and provides perfect screen chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix's character. I personably enjoyed seeing these two work together as the story built up.Overall, I found this film rather surprising in a positive way. The film is dark, gritty and loaded with tension as it progresses, but we also gain a greater understanding to Joe's thoughts and his mind. We are given plenty of creative detail thanks to the awesome work from the director. That being said, I feel many will enjoy the film's creativity while others might start to look at their watch during the film. For me, I loved it, and it was great to see something new and fresh in 2018 with yet another solid performance from actor Joaquin Phoenix. Worth a look!8.2/10

116,darkreignn,Masterclass,9,29 August 2020,"I didn't watch a single trailer for this movie. Literally the only reason I wanted to watch it was because it starred Joaquin Phoenix. If he's in a movie, that's enough convincing for me. I didn't know what the movie was about, or even the genre, but I assumed it would be an action film simply because the cover of the DVD had Mr. Pheonix gripping a hammer. And in fact, I assumed that this movie would be like the 2011 art-house action film ""Drive."" But you know what they say about assuming.The soundtrack, the hammer, the troubled, violent, mentally ill antihero. The fundamental ingredients of a ""Drive""-type story are there. But the story is much deeper and more layered then the story of ""Drive"" was. ""You Were Never Really Here"" deals with awful themes such as PTSD, child trafficking, political corruption, abuse, the call of the void, and much more. This is a bleak film, no doubt, but underneath it's dirtiness lies the beauty. At its core, the film is kind of sweet, though to get to the sweetness you do have to sift through the dirt. I don't want to spoil much about the plot, so I won't; instead, I'll mention some things that I loved about this film.For one thing, the action sequences were marvelously directed, and I would even hesitate to even call them action scenes because you hardly ever get the catharsis of seeing the bad guys get their much deserved punishment. Almost every time Mr. Pheonix goes to bludgeon someone with a hammer, the action is obscured. Want to see him beat a child trafficker to death? Well, you will, but you'll see it from the point of view of black-and-white security camera footage, or from the reflection of a cracked ceiling mirror. The action scenes are almost always never clearly displayed, which I found genius and incredibly impactful. This is no ""John Wick."" Joaquin's character clearly has a lot of pent up aggression, and though it would be satisfying to watch him unleash it on criminals, the director seems to understand that violence is violence, no matter the shape or form. Because of that, us as an audience never get the emotional release of clearly seeing the violence take place. I thought this choice was very clever, as it was kind of like the director was teasing us. Because rationally, as humans, we know that all forms of violence are wrong, whether it is abuse, murder, or whatever. It is natural, and perhaps even primal, for us to want to see people get punished for their wrongdoings, but the director never satisfies this bloodlust in us, instead making us wonder why, if we detest one form of violence, would we want to see another?It's an interesting commentary, to say the least. I am not saying the director is condoning what the bad guys are doing in this film, because obviously what they are doing will hopefully send them to the deepest, darkest, hottest layers of Hell where they will have their skin burnt off over and over for all eternity, Amen. But what I'm saying is the director is not saying one form of violence is wrong while the other is right. Instead, she seems to be saying that all types of violence is wrong, even if one is for a good cause. We want to see bad people get punished, and we never get to, meaning we never get the emotional release we would get by watching, say, ""Taken,"" for example.Granted, this could also be because the character Mr. Pheonix plays most likely also does not feel an emotional release from the havoc he is wreaking either. He is a very disturbed and hurt man, plagued with PTSD and suicidal thoughts. In my eyes, he kept hoping the pain he was inflicting on others would help him heal from the pain inside of himself, but obviously, it does not. He doesn't get a sense of satisfaction from his violence, and so neither do we. It's a brilliant move, and one I haven't seen done before.Of course the acting is all incredible from every one. Mr. Pheonix is one of the best actors of all time. Anytime he is in a movie, you best believe I'm going to watch it because he gives his all in everything. He seems to be very selective in the roles he takes, and it pays off because he was mesmerizing, sometimes subdued, sometimes explosive, and always sexy (did I say that outloud?). Also, Ekaterina Samsonov, who plays the little girl in the movie, also gives a heartbreaking and brilliant performance, and I wish she was in the movie more than she was.""You Were Never Really Here"" is a masterclass of filmmaking. It's an action movie that obscures all action, it's a character study of haunted people, it's a social commentary on the impacts of violence, it's a story of love and redemption in the face of violence and abuse, and above all, it's simply a damn great film.",You Were Never Really Here

Indeed, if all you were here for were the superb acting jobs of Joaquin Phoenix, Ekaterina Samsonov, and the rest of the stellar cast then yeah; all the overblown hyperbole fits. Sadly, great acting does not excuse or gloss over a weak plot, poor script, or bad action sequences in what is being promoted as a revenge thriller.At Cannes the director admitted to having no clue how to stage an action scene. It shows. Not that I was here for the wham bang, but if that had been part of the film, the rest of the overtly artsy and poor pacing moments may have coalesced a bit more.The best scene was at the lake.

His past torments him and he has hallucinations and experiences a distorted sense of reality. He contemplates suicide but doesn't do it, but does practice it with a plastic bag over his head and pulls it away at the last second.Remind me next time a Joaquin Phoenix is in a movie to really check it out before sitting down with it. He seems to revel in the Artsy movies, very slow with constant screen shots of his face. Okay his character is tormented about his past, lives with his mother and uses a ball peen hammer as his weapon of choice when confronting those who harm children. He goes about his business in a very calm manner killing those in his way. The title is so that when he kills someone he cleans everything up like he was never there. His next assignment is to free Senator Votto's (Allexl Manette) daughter Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov) and he does, but there is a twist about all this and you won't like it. This is very slow going and we never know what avenue Joe will go down next and for we in the audience this is somewhat annoying. Joe doesn't talk much. Scenes jump around a lot. All along in this we see flashbacks of his time in the war. Also the music never seems to fit.Notables: Frank Pando as Angel, Joe's first handler; John Doman as John McCleary Joe's second handler; Judith Roberts as Joe's mother.NOW consider that all this is a fantasy that Joe has about everything and nothing is real except in his mind. He was never in the war. He fantasizes about saving Nina who is really his mother, who he very close to, but he is the one who kills her; and in the diner at the end Joe actually does commit suicide and that should have been the last scene, but it wasn't. The very last scene has Nina coming back from the bathroom and says, ""let's go as it's a nice day out there. So maybe he didn't commit suicide. See? I don't. So you decide. As for me I will be more careful about Joaquin Phoenix movies. Don't care for Artsy movies as I never really understand them. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

119,Hallelujah289,"Painful, tortured, cathartic art house psychological drama",8,7 May 2019,"Dark, tormented Joaquin Pheonix delivers a familiar but far more extreme, suicidal experience, which manages to be believable and cathartic in his hands. ""You Were Never Here"" is a full length Prime Original film, but despite its hour and a half run time it still feels like a short film. Here, Pheonix is emotional and silently brutal, crushed and suffocated, and while there is not much support him because of the way the film is edited and images transposed on each other you still get a sense of Pheonix's backstory and his emotional arc. His internal emotional arc is the real plot of this film, which makes for quite a surreal, dream like and sometimes thin movie watching experience. But by the end you do get a sense of the superficial plot of the film (find missing girl) as a kind of metaphor for whag Pheonix is going through, and there's something of a meaningful helpfulness in all the bizarre cruelty. But this isn't a great, blockbuster film as much as a desperate will to live and to recognize emotional atrocity by intense violence. Effective, and honest, and there is something there. Although I asked myself what was happening a lot of the time I still got a sense of what the film was and wanted to be. However there isn't as much action as Amazon's synopsis might entice you to expect--i would say this movie is more of a true psychological drama more than anything. If you can approach the movie that way then you won't be disappointed. If you can stand many images of self-torture then you can watch this film. Not super graphic when it comes to brutality of other people but you do get an idea, but from a distance or in the aftermath. Achieves a watchable balancs.",You Were Never Really Here
120,daniewhite-1,I could never really hear,5,15 March 2020,"Unusual film with a distinctively edited structure and protagonist and a strong unconventional musical score but a sadly variable sound design with inconsistent sound recording which seemed to be at cross purposes with a ""subjective hearing"" sound mix approach at certain stages of the narrative.As a mood piece it certainly extracts it's maximum yield from well edited and paced suspense scenes and a fully embodied central performance.The only point at which vagueness and obscurity peal away is possibly a hanging question about the nature of 'saving' as a dramatic convention; where so often the saviour is, themselve's, finding salvation from their act.Otherwise this film is definitely going to appeal more to viewers who like to interpret stimulus in a personal and individual manner but probably not so much so to those wishing to view and evaluate the film makers art.As such I found 'You were never really here' to indeed live up to the suggestiveness of it's title although perhaps the better description would be that the film is never really here but rather the interpretation that it leaves.I interpret an interesting, if frustratingly inconsistently audible, 5/10 rating and I recommend to any viewer looking to fathom meanings from obverse sources but rather less so to viewers seeking a completed act of story and film making.",You Were Never Really Here

Unfortunately, You Were Never Really Here doesn't quite meet the expectations that the trailer promised - more of a slow-burning, passive crime film that doesn't ever satisfy the viewer. The film starts with a bang, immediately giving insight into Joe's (Phoenix) murky life as a pseudo-hitman with some dramatic and gruesome violence. From this point on, the initial highs are then never reached again - the plot becomes formulaic, and the characters do not evoke emotion as they apparently should do.Artistically, this movie does push the boat out: camera angles are used effectively, with long sweeping shots accompanying the use of sound for a more complete experience. Colour is also vivid, with scenes suitably reflecting the dark tones constant throughout the film.

And the one case the film focuses on, turns out to be very sinister indeed. Joaquin Phoenix is intense as Joe, a man unafraid of violence, but extremely tormented by his past. Definitely worth a watch. (Side note: If you watch it, towards the beginning of the movie Joe exits his house, you can hear in the background a small dog barking like crazy.

129,Jared_Andrews,Brutal and Reality-Blurring,5,11 May 2018,"Joaquin Phoenix stars in, You Were Never Really Here, a movie that beckons memories of Taxi Driver. It's an apt comparison since the two movies are deep character examinations, and Phoenix's character in this film, Joe, certainly shares similarities with Travis Bickle, Robert De Niro's famous taxi driver.  The two men both have traumatic pasts that inflicted irreparable damage on their mental health, and both men currently live unsatisfying lives. The main difference is that Travis Bickle attempted to make an honest living driving a taxi for a time before he, well, you can watch the movie and find out what he did. But, Joe's way of making a living is unlawful from the beginning of the film. However, he did initially attempt a lawful career years before the film's opening scene. I'll get there. Joe is a hired gun whose job is to hunt down missing girls, bring them back, and punish those that captured them. It's work not for the feint of heart. When asked if his methods are rough, Joe replies, ""I can be."" He's being modest. Joe brutally disarms, injures, and kills anyone standing in the way of his missions. His preferred weapon: a ball peen hammer.  Despite all the killing, he's not a bad guy. He cares for his elderly and often confused mother. The work he does, while often gruesome and heavy on killing, is for what most would agree is a good cause. Few could retrieve the girls the way Joe does and even fewer would be willing to do so. Joe takes no joy in any of his work. He takes no joy in any of his life. He continues forward out of some sense of duty. He fantasizes often about suicide and attempts on occasion, only stopping when he remembers his mother or the girls in need of help.  He often experiences vivid flashbacks and fantasies that blur the lines between what's real and not. The audience doesn't always know, and Joe doesn't always seem so sure either. He's constantly haunted by memories of his past as a child, a soldier, and an FBI agent. Each phase of his life left him scarred physically and emotionally. 
Phoenix is one of the most enigmatic, fascinating, and excellent actors of the past 20 years. It's hard to imagine other actors pulling off a performance like this one. He deserves commendation for his work, as does director Lynne Ramsay. Fair warning: the movie is occasionally brutally violent and is often very confusing.

The first is getting a lot of press, and I will admit Joaquin Phoenix is totally amazing, and puts in an Oscar worthy performance. I really loved his performance in this really confusing movie. I read a few reviews to see other's reaction, and several bring up ""Taxi Driver"" which happens to be my favorite movie of all time. Yea, Joe is a veteran of the Gulf War, and Travis of the Vietnam War, and each one is haunted by their military service. Joe is a hired gun, that goes after teenagers kidnapped into the child prostitution racket, and is hired to go find the daughter of a politician that has been kidnapped. He does that, but then he loses her again, after some hoods take her back, From there on, is totally your interpretation, and it certainly varies from viewer to viewer. Is all this just going through Joe's mind, as he is plagued by flashbacks, and illusions, or is some of it reality, as he appears to go rescue the teenager girl again? None of that is explained, and the movie gives you no help at all, and the ending is about as ambiguous as you can get. It's actually closer to a David Lynch type story, than anything else, IMO.

He tries to find a meaning in his life by professionally taking on the cases of missing or kidnapped girls and women. The film has an understated, almost melancholic and serious tone, there's little dialogue or humor, but the conclusion is for me rather cathartic and uplifting. It is definitely brutal at times.

Well they do and as far as the selection composed for this score does horribly with on beat off beat riffs and clanging. Sometimes it verged on the point of annoying and that is a no no.Acting - Was pretty on par with good to excellent rating but the writers wasted scene after scene trying to be so mysterious this film moves slower than a sloth and no cohesion is developed which may have been there goal but to a viewer waiting for 90% of a movie to look up mad and realize theres only 10 mins left.Special effects - Well if you consider turning away from the camera every time he goes to punch or swing or pan to cctv lens so it just looks like 2 grainy figures then yeh it had terrible effects. Pacing - Was terribly terribly executed and i'm being nice with that assessment. Borderline waste of time.. Storyline Comparisons - I guess this film would be the drunk nephew of "" Man On Fire "".So without further adue.. I say this film is PRETTY BAD

His total lack of fear and killing machine mindset make him good at his job, but his survival skills are tested when he gets more than he bargained for in trying to rescue the young daughter of a prominent New York politician from a high-end prostitution ring in Manhattan.What this film does differently is show very few scenes of violence per se, but instead depict the quiet power of violence with one brutally-finished victim after another lying horribly eviscerated. It has a cold, baroque score that amplifies the grim storyline, but sometimes the background noise and pregnant stillness can provide the film with a sterile sense of dread as well. It aptly portrays a tough guy's severe psychological demons coming back to haunt him in the face of sudden uncertainty. Some admirers have described this as a new version of ""Taxi Driver"", a comparison I have no issue with, but I also believe that it stands quite well on its own.I imagine a film like this is not going to become immensely popular because it's one of those low-key thrillers that does not rely too much on conventional moviemaking devices to keep tension going or to move the pace along. Even so, if you find the time to watch this startling film, you will come away with quite the impact. Strongly recommended.",You Were Never Really Here

142,OneAnjel,psychological thriller is the genre,10,23 February 2021,"10 stars for the tremendous acting and mind-bending presentation. It seems to move slowly but it does so with great intention. It's meant to be sipped slowly and deliberately because there are many morsels that will be missed if you look away. It should be listed as a Psychological Thriller. I've not seen anyone mention the title -- yes, it appears in a song early in the film, but it's not about the song. These kind of unsung heroes are what the military refers to as ghosts -- they get the job done but are never publicly acknowledged because what they do is so covert; they can never be credited, as if they were never really even there. No, he's not doing this for the military, but same premise. One review dissects Joe as having been molested by his mother and veers into an inaccurate perspective based on that erroneous conclusion. I thought it was very clear that Joe's father was extremely abusive and eventually took his own life. In that situation, a mother and son would bond over their shared victimhood and lack of ability to trust anyone other than each other. The film, in my estimation, tells the story of a boy who was severely abused and has PTSD as well as a constant death wish, which he stifles because of his sense of obligation. The adult born of this kind of suffering will try to perform heroic acts just to quiet his own mind. The film itself is almost mute except for the carefully chosen songs and lyrics that guide us into a certain atmosphere -- painted with sound instead of dialogue. It also has Joe and Nina counting in their minds over and over, which is a classic tell of a child who is severely abused or adults who endure torture. As much as sound, the Director also uses visual art in a profound way rather than just aim the camera at the actor and say 'action.' This film does not drop clues and then reintroduce you to those clues; you must keep up or the film may seem disappointing and disjointed. But if you enjoy psychological thrillers and unsung hero films, you will enjoy this film. The ending is hopeful. Great film.",You Were Never Really Here
143,bastille-852-731547,"Stylish, Slick, Slightly Undercooked Crime Noir",7,7 April 2018,"Joaquin Phoenix stars in this tense, noir-style crime drama as Joe, a vigilante figure with severe PTSD who helps rescue young girls from sex trafficking. I had been looking forward to this film for a long time after it won awards and received rave reviews at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. (It probably also helps that I'm a huge Joaquin Phoenix fan as well.) Viewers first meet Joe as he is heading to New York to visit his mother in Queens upon completion of a job in Cincinnati. He is soon called in to track down and save a state politician's daughter, who was abducted in Manhattan.Phoenix gives a powerful and wholly commanding lead performance. He works wonders by using gestures, actions, and expressions to communicate and develop his persona, as his character has relatively little dialogue. The film does depict his PTSD in a thoughtful manner, although the fleeting flashback scenes of Joe's past and/or nightmares come a bit too frequently. The film's cinematography and sound design are both outstanding, as the film's detailed and slick shots are expertly crafted and the sound design skillfully replicates a highly intense atmosphere of creeping dread one might envision headlining an excellent horror film. The film does have a critical misstep, though: it simply has less substance to its narrative than it would like the viewer to believe. While the film's plotting thankfully does not stoop low or settle into cliches, viewers may still feel slightly ""empty"" upon absorption of the film in its brief 90-minute runtime. Still, though, this is a very intense and generally solid crime film. It's not the next ""Taxi Driver,"" but those who like Joaquin Phoenix will certainly be able to appreciate it. 7/10",You Were Never Really Here

Third wave feminist woman-director of Scottish origin clearly has some sickness to her head, as also evident from her other, more successful efforts, like ""We need to talk about Kevin"". So this movie, ultimately, is a nasty, female pipe dream version of Braveheart, in the era of Jeffrey Epstein and #me too, crossed with ""I spit on your grave"", where bi gotry of Mel Gibson is substituted by ultra toxic bi gotry of the she-director, and the weapon of choice is not hammer, but boredom, with some psychosis spilling in straight from the she-director's chair. Lead actor bears surname Phoenix because he emerged from a real, pe do cult from which his family escaped when he was little, too bad he returned to the New age occultism in his adult days, and is lending his talent here for nefa rious purposes of boring you sick.

153,rcolgan,If Taxi Driver and Blue Velvet had a baby...,10,30 July 2018,"You Were Never Really Here is the story of an ex-FBI agent turned hired gun named Joe (Joaquin Phoenix). He has been hired by a senator to track down a 13 year old girl who was kidnapped and to inflict as much pain on the kidnappers as possible. But in his attempts to track them down, he seems to fall down a rabbit hole which leads to nothing but more violence and pain. However this story is rarely the focus and instead offers Lynne Ramsay to explore who Joe is and the horrible memories that plague his mind. As a hit-man he's very effective, taking down his targets with nothing more than a hammer, some duct tape and a plastic bag. But as a person he is a fractured individual who is unable to escape the demons from his violent past.This past as rarely talked about, but instead we have to piece his past through brief glimpses of the person Joe has become. We see this through the physical scars on his back, dark memories of an abusive father and sudden flashbacks of the horrors he witnessed whilst working as an FBI agent. There are often times when Joe will be doing something as mundane as waiting for a train, when we'll suddenly get the distinct impression that he's seriously considering jumping on to the tracks. In spite of having relatively little dialogue, Phoenix's performance sits alongside the greats like Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver or Christian Bale in American Psycho as a portrait of a man who is unable to escape the dark thoughts which are plaguing his mind. His constant detachment to almost everyone around him mixed with his look of pure anguish shows the hard life he has put himself in, whether he deserves to be there or not. Oddly enough, in spite of how much death and violence happens in the film, we rarely see these acts of violence on screen. Instead we are often left with the visual aftermath of this violence, along with the physical and emotional scars that Joe carries with him. It distinguishes the film from other detective thrillers and mixed with Jonny Greenwood's pulsating score perfectly capturing the rhythm of the films hypnotic imagery. But the main thing that shines through the film is Lynne Ramsay's vision of this painful life. She never relents on the cold atmosphere of violence that Joe seems to be trapped in and through this creates a powerful feature showing a damaged life, but still somehow leaves enough light at the end of the tunnel to make us think that some kind of redemption or release could still be possible.",You Were Never Really Here
154,isaacsundaralingam,How was this movie not as good as I wanted it to be?,4,23 October 2021,"This movie has been in my watchlist for a long long time, and finally when I had some time to spare, and that too on my birthday, I decided to watch it. And man, was it such a disappointment!You Were Never Really Here is well acted and well filmed. The movie looks absolutely gorgeous. But that's all there is to it. 'Gorgeous' is enough to grab your attention, but not to carry a movie. Everything besides the acting and the visuals were so pretentious it makes me nauseous. And I'm more than willing to blame it all on the writing, cos the writing in this movie just straight up sucked. It was like the whole movie was on its knees begging us the audience to believe that it's some sort of overly sophisticated work of art.When you have a plot that ends up being so stupid with even the slightest bit of examination into the specifics, with a main character written to have literally every art-house 'tormented individual' cliche, and with dialogue like ""Let's go because it's such a beautiful day"" uttered with a straight face in any context and expected to be taken seriously... Yea, that's where I'm comfortable disregarding this movie altogether. No amount of long shots, silence, close-ups and deadpan facial reactions can make something appear ""deep"" when there's no meaningful substance to back it up.And this so disappoints me, because I was really hoping for it to be amazing. I've heard nothing but good things about this movie, and I never would have thought it would be as pretentious as it was.

His nonchalant way of dealing with very serious scenarios makes for this movie to have a cool sort of atmosphere to it. It was shot extremely beautifully. I actually really enjoyed the whole, not showing the action sequences. It allowed the viewer to complete the scene in their head and I really dug that, plus it's a creative way to save some money.The real downfall that I had with the film is that the plot seems to not really have any depth. I mean, I get it, and I appreciate the lack of exposition that took place in the movie, I'm an adult and I can piece things together, but I feel like there were too many moving parts that they glossed over.So, the Governor is apart of this whole thing...and it's just sort of accepted by all of his security guards and things like that?

157,cappiethadog,Hell is for children,10,20 July 2019,"Mom(Lyubov Agapova) met her savior, a Russian-American, nightclubbing in Estonia, and is moving to the states ahead of her. Lilya Michailova(Oksana Akinshina), the mother promises, will be sent for, once she gets settled in with her new husband and country. During the interim, Lilya doesn't resort to prostitution like her schoolmates, who are also jobless and living in poverty, even though the 16-year-old girl has an inkling that she's been left behind. It's only after Lilya's slow-motion orphaning becomes official, when she learns from social services that mom has made her daughter a ward of the state, does she join the other reluctant lolitas in a parody of nightlife that unmakes their former selves. Lilya is a desperate girl, not an easy girl; a victim of glasnost and perestroika that turned the former Soviet Union into a capitalist state, which led to a disproportionate circulation of wealth just like any western country. The discotheque is a meat market, crawling with middle-age cretins, flush with money, on the hunt for desperate children they know are at their wit's end, and don't care. At the bar, Lilya looks like a doe caught in the proverbial headlights. The crashing of bodies is imminent. She's terrified. Lukas Moodyson, to his credit, in ""Lilya-4-Ever"", de-eroticizes the loveless lovemaking between child prostitute and john by keeping the camera tight on the girl's face in unbroken shots. Moodyson blinds the male gaze; the fantasy of ravishing an underage girl is blown to smithereens because he shows the agony it causes the fetishized object. The man hears Lilya's quiet sobbing; he gives little kisses on her cheek, an empathetic action of self-awareness that his amoral carnality is doing the girl, perhaps, longtime psychical damage, and yet, the barbarity continues. Now her body is a commodity. She runs in the snow, bleary-eyed, and stoops over to throw up. It's a steep price to pay; your very soul, in exchange for money to buy groceries at the small market and a basketball for her young friend Volodya(Artyom Bogucharsky). Night after night, Lilya returns to the scene of her debasement, until she meets the devil, a handsome young man sitting at the end of the bar. Andrei(Pavel Ponomaryov) promises her a job picking vegetables and a paid apartment in Sweden. Volodya, just 12, knows that Lilya is being duped. He knows how men are. Volodya is one of them, even at his tender age. Earlier, the boy fakes suicide, having pretended to swallow a handful of pills, resulting in a kiss under false pretenses. Volodya crossed a boundary. Lilya forgives her young friend, who, after all, is just a harmless boy with a crush, but she doesn't learn the important lesson that he imparts: Everybody wants a piece of her. That is how Lilya ends up in Stockholm, working as a sex slave, not prostitute; a working girl gets a cut; she's a prisoner. Witek(Tomasz Neuman), her pimp, pays Lilya in fast food hamburgers before returning his property each night to a lonely room after another night of blood, sweat, and tears.Nina Votto(Ekaterina Samsonov) holds a photo in her hands, the same one that Joe uses to ID her, on a double bed in Hades. Similar to Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"", the audience gets a second chance to reexamine a picture, some detail we originally glossed over. In the film's coda, after Carol(Catherine Deneuve) is carried out of the apartment by her sister's boyfriend, the camera pans throughout the living area until it freezes on a family photograph, previously seen from afar. The camera zooms in. This time, the camera focalizes on Carol as a young girl, staring not at the lens, but some man, an uncle, maybe, seated in a lawn chair, looking terrified. This man molested Carol; he is the cause of her catatonia. Lynne Ramsay, ironically, pays homage to Polanski, in ""You Were Never Really Here"", when a closer look at the photo that Nina's father gave to Joe, shows the girl employing the universal gesture for quiet; the bisecting of pursed lips with an index finger. We get it. Nina disobeyed her father and told mom. That's why she killed herself. The implied secret, a dirty one, explains why Nina watches with indifference as the television reporter brreaks the news about her famous father's sudden death. Senator Albert Votto(Alex Manette) in an apparent suicide, met his purposeful demise by stepping off the ledge of a skyscraper top. No words. Dry eyes. Nina is in a safe house, safer than her childhood home; a hotel room she shares with Joe(Joaquin Phoenix), who seemingly out of thin air, rescued her from an upscale brothel with a Manhattan address. Again, we get it. Joe gets it later on. The father was part of a sex trafficking ring, going so far as involving his daughter in exchange for political capital. Did he molest her, too? Back at the parking garage, the prepubescent girl shows no emotion towards the prospect of being reunited with her father. Even more telling, Nina reaches for a medicine bottle, when Joe tells the girl: ""I'm taking you home to your father,"" as if overdosing on pills would give her greater comfort. It's near-empty. She looks disappointed. This child, robbed of her innocence, has to relearn how to give and receive affection from adult males. Out of gratitude, she hugs him. And then a kiss, her lips lingering on Joe's cheek several beats too long, past the point of chasteness. He gently pushes Nina away. ""You don't have to do that,"" Joe says, then locks the passenger-side seatbelt on her. As a test, Nina tells her savior that she has to ""go"", this virtual stranger whom she just met an hour or so ago. After being surrounded by depraved men for so long, Nina can't afford to trust any male unconditionally, even dad. So she pees, in privacy, free of spectacle, and that's how the girl knows for sure that she can count on Joe. She sees, and we see, that he's not looking. The camera stays focused on Joe. He is standing behind a girder. The filmmaker recruits the audience, in a sense, to monitor his behavior. The ex-Marine needs to be perfect. He is; he doesn't try to sneak a peek. This sequence is no throwaway moment. For the girl, so accustomed to perverted behavior, it's a relief that Joe redraws the boundary of what's acceptable between adult and child. Her emotional age needs a reset. Using the bathroom becomes a normal activity again. Ramsay infers that back at the ""playground"", clients paid top dollar to watch, or worse. It's probably been ages since she felt the touch of an adult male, free of lechery. At the brothel, as they make their escape, Joe carries the girl on her back, walking past bodies the special ops expert immobilized with a ball-peen hammer. Joe has no children; he just saves them from people who exploit them, which is, in this instance, better than being a father.In Jonathan Ames' novella ""You Were Never Really Here"", Lynne Ramsay saw a chance to rework Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"", a bona fide masterpiece, for sure, but a flawed one, in the context of how changing social mores forces the modern viewer to reexamine consent, as it pertains to representations of men and young women in the seventies, the distant past. Joe and Travis Bickle(Robert DeNiro), both, are former Marines; both, save preadolescent girls from sexual deviancy, but Iris(Jodie Foster), unlike Nina Votto, displays the classic symptoms of Stockholm Syndrome and doesn't seem all that keen on being rescued. Iris needs to be convinced by the taxi driver that her life is ugly. She defends Matthew(Harvey Keitel), at a diner, over lunch, when Travis lectures the girl about the vileness of her pimp's outlaw vocation. But she loves him. In Iris' room, over light jazz, they slow dance. The young girl has both arms wrapped around the older man's waist, and likewise, he mirrors her clinch, as he whispers sweet nothings into her ear. Because Iris doesn't find this show of intimacy objectionable, ""Taxi Driver"" makes the argument that mutual love outweighs the profound imbalance in their respective ages. When Travis liberates her from the tenement cathouse, Iris screams when he shoots the security man, whereas Nina watches in silence as Joe hammers the playground guard into submission. Iris has no choice in the matter; she's going to be rescued because Travis determines that the girl needs rescuing. ""You Were Never Really Here"" challenges the Paul Schrader screenplay which floats the idea that a prepubescent girl would choose prostitution over a normal life. Ramsay sets ""Taxi Driver"" on fire. More than likely, Iris is in hell. A woman would know this. When Joe loses Nina to crooked policemen and has to save her again, this time at the governor's mansion, Ramsay throws gasoline on the fire. By the time Joe reaches his charge, Governor Williams(Alessandro Nivola) is dead. Nina slit his throat. Joe sits on the bed, laughing, because he realizes that the little girl saved his life; he could have been at the bottom of a lake, weighted down by rocks. As it turns out, Nina is stronger than him. He discovers Nina in the dining room, a cool customer, eating her dinner with bloodied hands. She recognizes in Joe, a Desert Storm veteran who specialized in retrieving lost girls, a kindred spirit. ""It's okay, Joe,"" Nina says. Who is saving who? Joe needs Nina just as much as she needs him.Lilya isn't that strong. She jumps off a bridge. Instead of going to heaven, she spends time in perdition with Volodya, another suicide victim, playing basketball on Estonian tenement building rooftops, with angel wings.It's a sin to take your own life.No exceptions.Even in death, there is no escape from the patriarchy.If only God was a woman.",You Were Never Really Here

This was all fake of course, as documented in the mockumentary 'I'm Still Here'.Watching 'You Were Never Really Here' (coincidence that the titles are so similar? I think not.) I got that same kind of feeling, that this was a pretend movie and soon Joaquin would rip off his false beard and wink at the camera to show us that this tedious mess was nothing more than a feature length joke.Alas, the more the film went on, with its incoherent excuse for a story and 'arty' camerawork at the expense of anything of interest, I realised to my horror that this was 100% a false hope.The horrible truth dawned: this was actually supposed to a serious attempt at cinema, and all the pointlessly convoluted flashbacks and the pretentious nonsensical flourishes were meant to be taken at face value. Oops.This being the case, what a atrocious piece of... cinema! For most of its length, we just see Joaquin silently staring at nothing in particular, as though to highlight his internal 'struggles'. Though not surely as much of the struggle of the unfortunate viewer to watch this unremitting tripe.The people he kills along the way we either don't see the deed being done or we get a quick edit of their brutal slaughter, as though any highlighting of their murder would distract from the movie's own sense of worthiness. So the one possible respite we could get away from the tedious navel-gazing is denied to us as well.

167,filmtravel101,This is NOT even close to Taxi Driver - Pointless Story yet well directed. 5 stars,5,8 April 2018,This film is a pointless story that has so many holes it feels like a glimpse of several stories that never really come together but very well directed and DP/Music work is very well done - and of course... Phoenix acting is fantastic but too bad the story just falls apart in so many places. Not sure what movie the critics watched to give it such a high rating yet maybe some people dont care about the story and are desperate for just cinema auteurs. Reminds me a little bit of Refn's Neon Demon mixed with a Schizo Taxi Driver.. great style but lacking in substantial story line to bring it all together. The double ending was almost laughable once again... sane or blow your brains out insane. Best to just call it whacky art film. Better luck next time as lots of potential for Director just sad to see story gone haywire. I agree with many on here.. it is a 10 for directing and acting. But without a good story i can only give it a 5 and not even recommend it except to film lovers.,You Were Never Really Here

176,Ansango,A generic action flick trying too hard too be artsy!,4,15 September 2018,"You were never really here is really a pretty peculiar kind of movie. While sure it contains a powerhouse performance by probably the greatest actor alive, the always reliable Joaquin Phoenix, it also contains a pretty generic story-line which can easily be summed in couple of lines.The pace is really really slow and it's a pity that even at 87 minutes, the films seems too long. Direction is pretty middling. While at times, it's pretty fantastic and distinctive, it also becomes quite tedious and muddled at times. The camera captures enough detail to manifest the inner and outer chaos of the lead character. The films claims to be a violent saga, but most of the violence is done off-screen, and well it might be an interesting cinematic choice and somehow helps in intensifying the ambiance and overall aura of the enigmatic protagonist, it also diminishes the overall mood of the film. The backstory and violent past of the lead character is the driving force of the film but it hasn't been exposed properly, hence the whole attempts seems less of a cinematic choice and more of a half-baked attempt at gaining some artsy points. Weird camera angles also don't help too much in this case. The whole film wears a gloomy tone over itself, it's just that it's a boring gloominess rather than a cinematic gloominess.There are literally 2-3 pages of dialogue throughout the entire course of the movie, so no point of talking about it. The story is so generic that you can't help but feel really weird while watching the questionable editing and cinematic choices made in the movie. The film is nothing more than a boring meditative drama coupled with a few off-screen violent scenes. The main core of child-sex trafficking is never fully explored and adds nothing to the value of the film. It's just there to shock the audience, and fails completely in the task.Joaquin Phoenix was wonderful and it's a revelation to watch him in this role. He literally becomes so much engulfed in the role that you don't see him at all, all you see is a violent recruiter with a traumatic past. The way his chemistry has been developed with his mother is truly heartwarming and it's really shocking and the most heart-wrenching scene when we see her killed.All in all, a typical traumatic-past veteran flick with too much overshadowing and a lot of focus on visuals and emotions rather than a good story.

Moronic directors/producers and writers have forgotten that the intent of a 'good' movie should be to ENTERTAIN. Thin plot with a LOT of senseless killing. Okay, he was hired to track down a girl who was the 'favorite' of some perv...then they (who probably could've found her themselves) kill all of his friends and mom. ...yeah, right. THAT'LL work for a story....run credits.I don't know where producers get the kind of money it takes to make a movie, but here's a secret... listening? If you want to NOT piss your money away, invest in some decent writing. An A-list actor ( not in my book) won't carry your movie or guarantee a return on your investment. This is just another one of those movies that'll fade quickly. Streaming services might try to push it a few times to see if any money can be made from it, but it doesn't take long to see that THIS MOVIE IS A LOSER in ALL respects.I could spend more time explaining all of the plot holes, but I already wasted my time watching this piece of trash - yes, it IS that bad.

Sadly, the movie films overlong even at 90 minutes, and a better director would have surely made a masterpiece out of it.Watched with my gf and best friend at an independent cinema, and although all three of us are very much movie buffs and lovers of art house films, this was simply underwhelming.

The music matches the emotion, at times jarring and annoying, similar to the war memories our unlikely hero endures throughout his search for a missing girl. The filming is excellent. Speak less, show more is the mantra of this film, and while long camera shots of his face can sometimes seem boring, it really forced the viewer to sit in the same spot as the main character ... one minute seeming like a lifetime while in a moment of pain. This role is worthy of Joaquin Phoenix and he should win an award for it. I've loved him forever and any time he takes a role, I'm eager to see what he'll do with it.

More importantly though, there is no mystery, and no suspense, the two key things you need in a mystery-thriller, if you're even going to be able to call it that. There's very little dialogue as well.There is no action either, and I don't know what some people are talking about when they say it is violent, you don't get to see any graphic violence what so ever, since in the only few cases where someone has suffered brutal violence, they are already dead. You don't actually see it happen. In other cases, some violence is shown, but they don't show any of the effects, or it is shown off-screen, or even through an in-movie surveillance camera...There is one short struggle between two people, and one instance of one guy shooting two people (which is shown off-screen, though the effetcs are shown afterwards), and one instance of one guy headbutting another guy. That's it. Everything else is, like I said, either off-screen, seen through a surveillance camera, or it's just an instance of coming across someone who has already been killed.With no suspense, no mystery, virtually no action, very little dialogue, and a very slow pace, this becomes very boring very quickly...There is a little bit of drama at least, but I can't fathom why this movie is rated so highly...Must be because of the topic and morals that are being looked at in the movie I guess...I guess movie critics don't want to be entertained when watching a movie, they just want a movie that has a message or a resolution they like, not caring how the movie gets there, or what happens along the way...I'm not sure what rating to give this movie, so I'm not going to give it one.

You may have heard something about this film being a modern ""Taxi Driver,"" but you are wrong (and those who made those lazy equivocations are wrong as well). If you are still with me, ""You Were Never Really Here"" is one of more interesting films I've seen in recent memory. It tackles a lot of very heavy subject matter in one go, though it does so in a rather oblique manner - like stealing glimpses from the corner of your eye because you dare not look directly at the thing. You have to think a lot to keep up. Some will get left behind. Some reviewers have called the film slow, but it seemed to be coming at me at a lightning pace. The violence of the film comes in rapid bursts - over before you know what's even going on. Like in real life, the blanks are filled in after. The film got me onto edge, such that I had no idea what was coming - a rare feat, these days.

197,realalexrice,Misunderstood by some,9,8 June 2021,"So rarely do I stay through a movie's credits because of the score but this utterly hypnotic accompaniment by Jonny Greenwood (of There Will Be Blood, Phantom Thread, Children of Men, and a billion other excellent scores fame) continually kept my attention upon this rewatch.While the movie is an atmospheric and moody genre piece, Lynne Ramsay's approach to violence is undeniably unique for the genre she is playing into (and against). Just as with We Need to Talk About Kevin, she is all about this idea of post-violence (that's not my idea, I'm not that smart), mainly because the director herself had said she'd never interacted with a gun before this. Through this post-violence is where the brutality of the movie really comes through, whereas in the second half when the film shows Joe being more brutal on camera, it comes off less convincing as Ramsay was trying to figure out how to choreograph and shoot violence, something she'd never done before.While I guess it (the violence and the pacing and the quick flashbacks and everything else anyone criticized) didn't work for everyone, I found it effective because of the performance by Joaquin Phoenix. We all know he is one of the best actors today so I won't waste time saying anything else. But, through his performance as Joe, it's relayed to me that I really don't want to see the violence, as Joe tells Nina to close her eyes before he does away with the child offender in the ""playground."" Not only does she not close her eyes, she doesn't look away, and is obviously not better for it. In fact, it could be partially what drives her to eventually murder Governor Williams when he kidnaps Nina shortly after Joe and her just got to safety. Joe's face is riddled with a life of uncompromising and unrelenting violence, whether from his childhood home life, military background, or FBI work, he's seen the worst of the absolute worst and Phoenix displays it immaculately. He's stuck in such a vicious and unforgiving cycle that even when he does a good thing like saving Nina, he still wants die. And without Nina there, he just thinks about the next time violence will sprout in his life as it's seemingly all he's ever known. They need each other, not in an intimate way (like she initially thinks when he saves her), but in a human way. By being with one another, there's an understanding just in their glances they share, and that's enough for them while they heal for now.",You Were Never Really Here

None of the characters have any depth besides Joe himself, whom we see glimpses of as a child, resulting in a simple story with mostly empty characters.This film is like an action movie with a hint of character drama in it - but there isn't enough to make the whole film a character drama, because Joe simply isn't explored enough. Most of the focus seems to be on pushing Joe into brutally violent scenes in order to save Nina. Why? Not sure.With some tuning, this movie could be greatly improved.

212,i_ianchev,You were never really here,10,15 April 2018,"A movie with particularly clear and finalized title, which I was expecting to be very good. It actually amazed me...This performance by Joaquin Phoenix is truly astonishing, as he really immerses in the character. The lead indeed deserved to get the best actor won at ""Festivalle de Cannes"". I saw so many shades of human fright and terror in him, so much humane aspects, that I really now admire his traits. I had some reservations before, but he has brought the craft to perfection.And with such a beautiful and unique script, this thriller can't really be avoided.
The used before ""hitman rescues a girl"" trivia is known to us, but the direction by Lynne Ramsay has quite the perfect execution of every small detail. I believe you can't really be spoiled, as the structure of the movie follows some well known patterns by ""Taxi driver"" and ""The Professional"". What really depressed me in a good way were the pacing (the movie is only 1:30 hour long), the finest details (those hallucinating episodes!!!) and the overall weight of the film. I cannot really stress out how much I enjoyed seeing two human beings, who were enemies a moment ago, singing the same song! 
The cinematography of this masterpiece is very diverse. The shots aim from various angles, always pointing out both important and contradicting emotional values. I liked very much the use of music in this movie. There are a lot of messages about the current American culture and what it is obsessed with, and they are enhanced by every word in a song in the background. We have a nice mix of old time hits with modernistic sound.I liked also the homages to Psycho and other easter eggs in this small, but full of matter film. Movies have to be inventive, but also have to show that the craft has developed from and been influenced by other masterpieces.Character development is important, steady and fulfilling. The audience craves for a moment to breathe and it gets it only with the last words in the film.
When I start to compare this movie with others, I can only say that every inch of it is genre perfect and the last bit of spice which I always need to give a film 10/10 is there. You cannot anticipate it, you cannot think of it, you just feel it. A perfect movie about human beings, which are capable of utmost violence and at the same time crazy-incidental altruism. Much like nowadays hurry-to-grave lifestyle on our 7 billion planet.
The cinema of last two-three years has steadily grown its reconciliation branch. We must talk to each other about every possible problem between us. Every possible way that we can. Every time that we can. Time is important, we don't have that much of it.",You Were Never Really Here

I see my review more as a fair warning. To prove my point, just check the Metacritic reviews, they loved it big time, as in Cannes Film Festival too. Unlike most of the users of this site, they feel the same way as I do.First of all, I must be clear on my 1 star, it's not my actual review, but IMDB won't let me give a 0. This piece of so called ""movie"" is a whole mess up since the very beginning. It seems like an experiment from a bored child who's trying to get attention from ultra artsy audience. Extremely boring, baffling and pretentious. In a nutshell is a plotless idiotic attempt of a thriller drama. If you haven't seen it yet, avoid it at all coast, throw away and bury your curiosity and don't waste 90 minutes of your life. You've been warned. P.s. please also ignore the false advertising on this movie about being as a modern Taxi Driver or a Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive type of film. It has nothing of it, not a bit.

I suspect that I am supposed to be feeling histrionic waves of emotion during the long, drawn out scenes of Phoenix standing and grimacing while mood music plays in the background. He's on a train bridge, emoting. He's standing in a dark room, emoting. He's sitting on the shore of a lake, emoting. I imagine that some of the audience would feel this, but the film leaves me uninterested in the subjective life of the character. I can't care what he's feeling because I just can't find anything to care about.I also found some of the scenes to be amateurish and superficial. He is asked to photograph a tourist and her friends and he has a flashback, for instance. I think some people would enjoy this type of exposition, with jump cuts and jarring juxtaposition of imagery.

So I wasn't rushing out to see this one.But I am a fan of Joaquin Phoenix; I think he's a good actor and fun to watch. So I gave it a chance, and I'm really glad I did. This movie was a lot different than the others I had mentioned before. The pacing and tone of the film were both perfect. And the story was fairly unpredictable, which is a good thing. There were moments in the film where I had no idea what would happen next. Even having seen the trailer several times (I feel that trailers far too often give away too much of the plot) I was in for a few surprises.The violence was done tastefully and different (better, in my opinion) than most films. And there were at least two or three scenes that felt totally different than anything I remember seeing in any other film, which is rare. To top it off, the performances were great all throughout the film. It looked like Joaquin may have even hit the gym in preparation for this role.The story was great; nothing felt over-explained and it all felt pretty real. It never got too corny or unbelievable. The music and camerawork were both very well done as well, and at less than an hour and a half it wasn't a bit too long.",You Were Never Really Here

223,dreamingescapist,Joe also has some specific set of skills.,9,12 September 2019,"Joaquin Phoenix boasting a Fidel Castro beard and staring intensely at people or stuff. 'You Were Never Really Here' is kind of movie that you either hate or love. I loved it, and I believe that it raised Lynne Ramsay into my favorite directors category. In recent years I we have seen so many films that are all great (well, at least good, or watchable), but we already know the story. This movie is nothing new in the storywise. But Lynne Ramsay shows us that there are so many visual tricks to tell worn-out tales with the breeze of freshness. I know, many people call this piece artsy-fartsy pretentious crap, but there is something in this movie. And not only Joaquin Phoenix's powerful performance. 'You Were Never Really Here' is very complex way to tell simple, already known story. We are given only glimpses of the background of the story, yet everything is clear what is actually going on. Little bit more attention to the details and nothing is confusing. I also like the way the violence was depicted - brutal, but noting overly explicit (not that I mind gore, but it is nice to see something refreshing every once in a while). The ending (that is almost a twist) is quite clever social commentary, and at the same time it closes the circle of the whole movie's dreamlike atmosphere.'You Were Never Really Here' is basic revenge story that is not your basic revenge story.",You Were Never Really Here
224,fbmike,Holy Smokes!,1,2 May 2018,And I didn't mean that in a good way. This is what happens when you smoke too much weed. You make a movie like this. A Jumbled mess that only a stoner could appreciate. Then he wouldn't remember it afterwards anyway. Probably was the producer's plan all along. This was a WTF hour and a half of my life. Joaquin Phoenix can be good at times but the dude is one strange bird. Don't know if he is a stoner but what do you think? I heard he spends all his time in Colorado and he is not there shopping for shoes. So many worthless scenes that should never have made it this movie. It's like they had a certain amount of time to kill so they just put anything in there to fill the time. What's worse is this actually could have been a decent flick if everyone would have been sober. They all got to smoke and all I got out of the deal was a few bucks taken out of my wallet. They probably all got paid in bag of weed and Joaquin headed off into the mountains. Some critics out there who wouldn't know a good movie if it shot their mama. This movie should have been called Jeez!,You Were Never Really Here
225,iamjacksmoviechannel,Taxi Driver...sort of,6,24 April 2018,"Lynne Ramsay's movie ""You were Never Really Here"" is being compared to ""Taxi Driver"" and yeah, when you have a scene where a vigilante lays waste to a prostitution den of underage girls you're going to get that comparison. Otherwise the movie is more subdued. Joaquin Phoenix is Joe, an Iraqi war veteran who often needs to put a plastic bag over his head just to escape the major anxiety he feels. This is a violent man but he tries to make up for it by caring for his old mother and being an avenging angel.He's called upon to save an underage girl and what follows is gritty, violent, and intense, with a few devastating surprises thrown in. But there is also a slowness here, that may be off-putting to some, deliberately there so we consider the film's significance. Unfortunately that point-that violence begets more violence to a suffocating degree- feels like it's been done far too many times to really call it a study.So this won't be a movie for everybody but if you like brooding performances, you'll love Phoenix's introspective turn. With only flashbacks for character development and few words spoken, he brings out Joe's turmoil nicely.If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more",You Were Never Really Here

How much of what you hear about a film before you see it actually impacts you eventually liking it. Maybe we hold this thought as it requires analysis and research but cinema with too much hype has a higher chance of failing. Now coming to this film. You were never really here got a seven minute standing ovation at Cannes and the critics have loved it. So you might go in with an expectation of seeing a kick ass film. But then Cannes while often sets the standard of great cinema irnonically also is the benchmark of pretentiousness and pseudo intellectulism. You were never really here fits the latter profile. As for the expectation - that is a cheque that the story of YWNRH simply cant cash. Lynne Ramsay who made the stunning and frankly underappreciated we dont need to talk about kevin. Comes up with another troubled character study. This time with a much more hollywood premise but arthouse treatment. Joe played by a beefy and bearded Joaquin Phoneix is a PTSD suffering contract killer who saves girls from human trafficking. His character is a traumatised one having had an abusive childhood, war PTSD and then trauma of having seen 20 dead girls in a room as an FBI agent. His relationship with his loving mother is the only thing keeping him alive. Soon his latest job quite predictably puts his already troubled persona in a complete spin. He is hired to save the underage girl of a senator from human traffickers and soon gets embroiled in a gubernatriaol conspirancy, crooked FBI agents and lots of violence. The story is one dimensional and crap. It could have been told in 20 mins. The treatment is boring boring boring. The pace slow and lacking narrative. There is scene after unnecesary scene that does no value add to the plot (maybe because there isnt any). The dialogues are mumbled so that the movie can pretend it has depth. The topic is of paedophilia nad violence disturbing so the movie can preted to be serious. The acting is self indulgent and the scenes are unnecessary so the actors and the story both can pretend that they are the shits. But after sitting through just 45 minutes of pointless, boring, slow artsy fartsy sequences where Joaquin shows off his acting prowess and Lynn shows off her direction (you can never completely see the act of violence of being commmitted except one), you begin to wish that you were never really here either. The only saving grace is the cinematography and tghe music of Johnny Greenwood (of radiohead and there wil be blood) but not enough to save the film.

However, this movie's unrelenting violence is gruesome and sick, and I'd like to warn away those who do not want to subject themselves to graphic scenes of brutality. Unfortunately in lieu of drama, Ms. Ramsay simply turns up the volume (I'm being literal here) so that many of the horror scenes are preceded by almost ear-shattering decibels of sound effects and, possibly, music (I had to stuff my ears with tissue to ward off the pain). Her idea of art is apparenty the many designs a cinematographer can make with blood, blood and more blood throughout the entire film. The fact that many metacritic reviewers gave this film 100 has made me very sad over how our culture has come to accept violence as entertainment, in films, in local TV news, in reports of almost daily shootings throughout the country.

243,zippyflynn2,A Knight in Bleeding Armor,9,26 May 2018,"Joe, brilliantly underplayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is a man who has a long, nightmarish history of extraordinarily savage trauma. From an appalling, abusive childhood, to his career choices as a battle-weary soldier fighting in Afghanistan, as an FBI agent witnessing the worst of human trafficking (all brought to the screen via adeptly placed flashbacks), to his present occupation as an effective and brutal retriever of runaway, lost, and abducted young girls. Joe's life is one series of horrific events after another, each one capable of breaking and shattering many people beyond hope. There are times Joe seems hopeless himself, as he toys, fantasizes, and dreams of suicide, yet always drawn back into the world of life by those who need help, trying to bring hope.  The most significant person in Joe's life is his mother, who was either always a child emotionally and mentally or thrown back into the state by the ghastly abuse and torture at the hands of her husband. Despite what many are tempted into concluding, Joe's relationship with his mother is neither incestuous nor of any Oedipus/Freudian nature but rather is taking devoted care of his beloved mother whom he couldn't rescue as a young, terrified, brutalized boy. Joe's vicious, prolific physical scars were mostly from his monstrous father during childhood, as we see in flashbacks. But we don't see the acts that caused them, which is one of the film's best strengths, to omit material that makes the viewer's imagination uncomfortably inquisitive.  This movie is not for the faint of heart: merciless, ugly, savage, and doesn't deliver any possibility of happy endings for just about everyone involved. Yet, despite it's somewhat fantastical feel, it raises many important though savagely brutal topics and questions. Perhaps the most brutal person is Joe, as he wields a ball peen hammer - interestingly, a weapon of torture that had been used by his father - in ways that are excruciating, deadly, and without any hesitation when he deems necessary. Joe is nevertheless sympathetic, a man whose life has been a long, extraordinary horror and is doing his best to do something that is good, sometimes by being kind and tender, other times by murder. This film will make you uncomfortable, even when you think about it later as it is important and well done in its depiction of awful yet mundane horrors, nightmares that people survive, witness, and experience, sometimes with sublime hope.",You Were Never Really Here

There is literally about six minutes of action in the entire film, the rest is tedious nonsense. Would it have killed the director to throw us a bone somewhere before the movie is over one third of the way to the lights coming back on? Flashbacks to nowhere, taking care of the old and feeble-minded, and lots of slowness, very slow. Someone needs to learn about pacing. Just because an actor is fat, hairy, and mumbles doesn't mean he's putting in a stellar performance: just because the viewer has no freaking idea of what is going on doesn't mean the director is doing something admirable. It's not that we're too stupid to understand what you're trying to say; it's that we don't care. Once again, a director seems to have forgotten that films are supposed to be entertainment.

Most of the scenes are cut to the aftermath of the violence.The overall plot of the movie is intentionally kept ambiguous to keep it centered more around Joe and what he knows.

Lots of bad composition and very choppy camera work. The amount of times lighting was out of continuity was distracting. The jump cuts are jarring and serve as a pretentious purpose to try to make violence as non glorified. This director does not understand how to use violence. Not showing violence or showing violence, it all depends on the tone the violence is presented in. Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most overrated and talentless actors in existence and this proves he is another incompetent actor who does nothing. His performance is awful and annoying. The score was constant noise as this is no surprise from a horrible composer like Jonny Greenwood who has composed many pretentious work for awful director Paul Thomas Anderson. This is another irritating soundtrack from failed guitarist of mainstream era music boy band Radiohead. There is no story, but it rather copies everything Taxi Driver did. Focus on the psychology nature of this man who was once a war vet. Word for word and even visual for visual copy of Taxi Driver. The only twist is it tries to be French New Wave full pretentiousness. Lynne Ramsay has crafted another awful movie alongside a really bad thriller called We Need to Talk About Kevin, Morvern Callar, and Ratcatcher.

I also found it to be one of the most intensely atmospheric films I've seen in awhile. I'm still thinking of this movie four days after viewing it. I read a good deal of the negative reviews and I understand the legitimate reasons why people disliked this film. The subject matter is not for everyone and the film is a bit surreal/speculative, leaving some aspects up for the viewer to interpret. Many people who gave negative reviews were frustrated by some of the more opened-ended aspects of the film and were obviously expecting an action/thriller with a more straight forward narrative. People enjoy different types of movies but this is in no way a ""bad"" film.

It works well with the way Joaquin play his lead character. A broken man, who does the dirty work that no one else is up to. Does he do it because he wants to, or is it because he needs to? Its not clear. The subject matter of human trafficking and enslavement is uncomfortable, and his role is one of revenge and rescue. But somewhat surprisingly, most of the violence is muted by fuzzy focus, and offbeat camera angles. This is welcome, and in my view, enhances the focus on his brooding psychosis, not the ""action scenes"". Clever, IMHO.In the end, it comes across more as a story of his redemption.

271,FrostyChud,Not what it appears,7,29 November 2017,"If you thought this was a film about a disturbed loner avenging an innocent, you got snookered. The only way to understand YWNRH is through a Freudian lens. The theme of this film is not father-daughter incest as it appears, but rather mother-son incest. Joe has an incestuous relationship with his mother. ""Stay with me a little longer,"" she says when he puts her to bed. In the next scene, she is trying to cajole him into coming into the bathroom where she is naked. The multiple references to PSYCHO are not a coincidence: this too is the story of a man transformed into a serial murderer by his obscene mother. The story proper is nothing is a paranoid delusion: hence the title of the film and the mysterious ""invisibility"" of the main character.The true story: Joe, as a child, is dragged into an incestuous relationship by his mother. His father, whose job ought to be to prevent this regressive fusion, does not have the authority to separate them. He is too violent, too weak, or too absent: we never find out. All we ever see of him is a hand holding a hammer. This scene must be understood as a metaphor. Father discovers their relationship and explodes; as he rages impotently with his hammer, mother and son exchange a complicit glance under the bed. Translation of the mother's wink: ""He's impotent. You're still MINE."" On mother's credenza is a photo of her as a young and beautiful woman and a photo of her son. Father has been eliminated from the picture. Joe rescues abused girls. This is a fantasy. No abused girl ever existed, only an abused boy. Joe invents the story of a girl abused by her father as a displacement of the true abuse: a boy by his mother. What actually happens in the movie, and what is fantasy? What actually happens is very simple. Joe murders his mother. Joe commits suicide. Perhaps the homosexual encounter in the sauna and the drugs are true. Everything else is a delusion that he creates to escape from the horror of the truth. In Joe's fantasy, he is a powerful man and not a victim. He has a benevolent father figure (McCleary). He makes ample use of the hammer which appears to be the only trace of a paternal legacy. The Nina character is how Joe sees his mother: as a beautiful, innocent, prohibited object of desire. Joe's delusion is simultaneously an attempt to understand the truth and an attempt to flee the truth. David Lynch uses this technique more explicitly in LOST HIGHWAY, MULHOLLAND DRIVE, and TWIN PEAKS. It is very effective on film and Lynne Ramsay is right to exploit it. In Joe's delusion, the father (represented by the two- dimensional Votto and Williams characters) takes ""illegal"" possession of his daughter. In reality, this is how the young Joe perceives his father's possession of his mother: as an unbearable crime that must be punished. Did Joe murder his own father? It is possible. Note that in all of Joe's traumatic flashbacks, women are being murdered, not men. These flashbacks are not real. They are irruptions of Joe's deepest fantasy: murder his mother. He never went to Iraq.One day, like Ed Kemper, Joe finally kills his mother. He is the one who shot her in the head. To exculpate himself, he flees into an unbelievable political conspiracy fantasy in which all symbolic fathers are pedophile criminals. Why is Joe so protective of his mother's privacy? Because he doesn't want anyone to find out what is going on between them. I wasn't sure the director understood her own story until the moment she replaced Joe's sinking mother with Nina. Here she could not be clearer: Nina is just a fantasy screen for Mother. In reality, Joe really does shoot himself in the diner. The fantasy of a happy future with Nina is just a screen. I have read Jonathan Ames before and the theme of maternal incest is often implied (his fascination for transsexuals is further proof of an Oedipal thematic). Good movie.",You Were Never Really Here

The scenes jump alot which gets somewhat confusing, I even dozed a bit. His mom his shot execution style but I dont understand why unless it has to do with one of his jobs. Not sure who did it but the reviewers have you believe joe did it. Then he wraps her in a bag and takes her to the lake to dump. Why does he not call the police? Probably due to his line of work.

A picture paints a thousand words and deeds speak louder than words spring to mind when recalling this movie as it is more about physical acting than any great dialogue. It is impactful and memorable for what the actors portray rather than any great diatribe performed by any one particular player.There were certain elements that almost swayed me not to like the film so much but that could just be my personal preference such as the use of the mood setting music and noises but without it due to the lack of dialogue the movie would probably have seemed fairly quiet.Also with the title being what it was and the main lead being a deeply troubled man I had reservations as to whether it would all be in his head and it would turn out he imagined it all; thankfully the story does not unfold like that although ultimately its up to you to decide quite how the movie ends.,You Were Never Really Here

It is definitely without studio interference which is perfect. The photography is very well shot, lighting and camera angles are better than most with only one or two predictable sequences. The only reason those sequences stand out was their being well below the exceptional standard set by the rest of the film. Very obersevational, dark and suspenseful. It starts out at a comfortable metronomic slow pace and that doesn't really change throughout the movie. Tension and drama are created by the soundtracks volume and mostly by the story itself.

After these notes, it's interesting to talk about the story, and it was really good enough. This movie is about psychology and mind problems, so it is clear there is not anything regular inside, the man kills, kills, and kills, but there is no police to arrest, arrest, arrest,... it looks people do not have any identity.

I read a little about psychology, about 6 months. So i can sit and watch this movie, but i think people wont like to spend their time on it.

287,isaacj02,Lynne Ramsay delivers full force in harrowing psychological thriller,10,15 July 2019,"Lynne Ramsay has shown herself to be an especially powerful voice in cinema, a filmmaker who prides upon working on her own terms and telling stories she wants to tell. The slight disadvantage of Ramsay's selective methods mean that we see only sporadic offerings from her... yet when we do get to feast our eyes on a Lynne Ramsay project we're not in for disappointment. You Were Never Really Here is the writer-director's fourth film, a favourite at Cannes at 2017 and starring the exceptional Joaquin Phoenix. Based on a novella by Jonathan Ames, this is some of the finest work we have yet seen from Ramsay; harsh, bruising and raw, You Were Never Really Here is the psychological thriller as it's meant to be done.
Phoenix plays Joe, a brutal yet efficient gun for hire who specialises in finding and rescuing missing teens. We first meet Joe in the opening shot as he attempts to asphyxiate himself; it's an uncompromising and harrowing image that sets the path of what is an uncompromising and harrowing film. Joe is ravaged by thoughts of suicide, tormented by memories of childhood abuse and wartime tragedy. He is hired by a Senator whose daughter has been kidnapped by a sex ring; it seems easy work for Joe until everything starts to go awry in a violent tale of mystery and trauma.
It is tough to think of any way to adequately respond to this film other than to applaud it. Lynne Ramsay crafts a measured thriller, reeking with tension and thematic richness. It runs at a brief 90 minutes though doesn't feel rushed; truth is, there's no trimmings here... every shot is painstakingly rendered, every flickering look and every burst of remarkably contained violence reasoned and impactful. It's a film of few words and this is absolutely to its credit- we understand so much more about Joe and his fragile mental state in that cruel silence. On the outset, one expects an action thriller, a Taken revenge story, but Ramsay turns all expectations on their head. You Were Never Really Here is a pure character study of a deeply troubled man. It's a testimony of grief and mental torment and prefers quiet moments of tension over bloody gore. The film rests entirely on Joaquin Phoenix, who like Ramsay is delivering some of the most compelling work of his whole career. Phoenix utterly immerses himself in a character that is tragically believable and bolstered by an understated performance from the Oscar nom. However stupendous Phoenix is, Ramsay is the true maestro here. Her direction in this film is enough to quench any sceptics of her skill, a daring approach that lingers on moments of profundity but equally gives the audience no time to breathe. Though there are moments of alarming violence, this is not the focus of the film; we're distanced from Joe's 'work' (one certain sequence is viewed through the prism of a security camera) yet the fractured flashes of Joe's damaged psyche are as real and horrifying as anything. In this brutality however there's something eerily beautiful about You Were Never Really Here; it's a film full of gorgeous and shocking visual poetry that takes an unnervingly surreal approach and blurs the field of reality- how much of what we are seeing is real and how much of is actually the tormented dreams of our troubled protagonist? It's one of many interesting questions that is raised... but pleasingly never answered. The sparse dialogue here means there is a relieving lack of exposition; Ramsay isn't leading you by the hand but rather allowing you to sink into the world she creates and form your own perspective. It's a world conjured in an illusionary style by Thomas Townend's judicious cinematography and elevated with unsettling vigour by a superbly atonal score by Jonny Greenwood.
There's something remarkable about You Were Never Really Here; lacking in ornamentation, everything on show here has some effect, every seemingly trivial shot meaning something more than it does on the surface. It's a challenging watch but this is part of what makes this and the rest of Ramsay's filmography so enthralling. Some will walk away asking deeper questions, others will walk away simply satisfied by an intense thriller. Either way, you'll appreciate the raw craftsmanship behind it, every aspect perfectly aligned to create an eerie and mesmerising piece of cinema.",You Were Never Really Here

At some point some director was sitting bored out of his mind at home and he saw literally the most mundane thing imaginable and he was like ""hmm... I could make a movie about that"".Why would I care about a guy cleaning his bath? What is the story there? What's the point of that scene? What's the point of any of the scenes? I don't care that your fridge is disgusting. Give me something that even remotely resembles pacing. Nothing happens in movies nowadays.

It is literally that captivating. I am not some brilliant reviewer but some words that come to mind are visceral, brilliant, ephemeral, mind blowing, guttural and mesmerizing. The screenplay, direction, cinematography, music and acting are all beyond words. Whoever this Ramsay chick is we will be seeing a lot more of her I am sure. Despite how violent it is or rather alludes to, there is a tenderness, a serene quality that is utterly captivating. The relationship Joe has with his mother is beyond exception in depth and was brilliantly orchestrated. Judith Roberts was also amazing. I would have given it a 10 but I was a little thrown by the ending. Its not a bad ending but I was confused at times what was 'real' and what Joe might have been imagining. If you are a lover of really really good film, not just a movie goer, you must watch this without interruption. I can see in this film Phoenix is building his acting muscles to meet the demands and skill of Joker. Bravo!

This one is no different. i had high hopes for this film,knowing that Joaquin Phoenix was in it,and how you can feel this strong bond between him and the little girl made it more interesting. But it's truly disappointing how the director Lynne Ramsay who also wrote the screenplay,chose to bring it that way. I can hardly even understand what each actor is saying, and the fact that each one only speaks few words fro start to finish is so strange. I have'net read the book,but i hardly think it's with no dialogue like the film!! The lead character played by Phoenix is so torn apart and confused,that you can't even imagine that he's real. The first 25 minutes,you are struggling to understand what is going on, and you barley understand by the end,given that no one actually talk. The performance of Phoenix and the little girl was great,but it didn't save this movie from the poor narrating style and the lack of dialogue. i really wonder how it might be like,if it was directed differently.

299,Frame-By-Frame,Stylish movie that will provoke both praise and criticism,8,12 April 2018,"Joaquin Phoenix stars as Joe, a traumatised gulf war veteran who tracks down missing sex trafficked girls for money. His past has made him unafraid of violence. This makes for an almost Tarantino like unstoppable hammer yielding contract killer. Things start spiraling out of control when he takes on the case of a New York Senator's missing daughter. This is probably sounding like a typical action movie so far but it's far from it.
Joe is also caring for his elderly sick mother. All through the movie the writer plants clues through flashbacks and scenes that the viewers may interpret differently. Look out for the clues about family abuse. Sometimes it's hard to know whether scenes are real or whether Joe is hallucinating. This style of cinema makes the viewer have to work hard.
The soundtrack is fantastic with excellent use of atmospheric music to emphasis what is actually a visual movie with very little dialogue. Though that's not something you necessarily notice whilst watching it because the movie is also highly engaging. I particularly liked the way some of the sounds were elevated to an almost neurotic level. It gave a heightened sense of realism to the focus of the scene through a kind of detachment.
If the movie succeeds then it's because of Joaquin Phoenix's stunning performance in what could be described as an artsy neurotic film.
My rating 8.5/10
Can I recommend it? You'll see the reviewers are split on this. It's far from a movie where everything's handed to the viewer on a plate. The viewer has to work hard to make sense of it. It's violent. It's visually engaging with not much dialogue. Consequently some may find it boring. Movies like this can make you feel cheated by the end if you've misinterpreted or missed the clues throughout. But that can be a joy and make you want to watch it again. Strangely I think if you're a fan of Mulholland Drive then you'll enjoy the style of this one.",You Were Never Really Here
300,yutko2004,"good acting, bad and disturbing movie",2,14 July 2018,Let me say what I liked about the movie. The acting was very good. Joaquin Phoenix was convincing portraying a disturbed veteran and child abused. The kidnaped girl Nina was very good as well and I was really worried what this roll would do to her future mental state. The storyline was interesting although we have seen movies about the subject. What I didn't like about the movie were the undeveloped characters. we have glimpses from Joe's past but never seen the conclusion to what happened to his father. The movie was too slow. 2 stars for the acting.,You Were Never Really Here

To me he's one of those actors that once he's played a part, I could imagine no one else in the role...Freddie Quell in PT Anderson's ""The Master"" was just brilliant and I don't think anyone could have matched PS Hoffman in that film the same way. In this film he's the hero, but not like we're used to seeing heroes portrayed in most played-out vengeance movies with bodies that took 12 months prior to filming to sculpt, or Special Forces Navy SEaL backgrounds. Instead his background represents trauma, pain and regret, which has been the subject of films many times before, but the lack of flashiness works in this movie because I think it makes his role more believable and realistic.

309,pooz_the_gun,Unconventional fresh take on a run of the mill story,8,18 April 2020,"Let me start off this review by saying that this movie is carried by three main components:
The Direction,
The Score,
and the Acting by Joaquin Phoenix.This movie is certainly not for everyone, because its main appeal can be also the primary reason for people to dislike it. It's its handling of delivering a story that we've seen similarly a thousand times in mostly mindless action movies in such an innovative and truly unique way.The Director, instead of shouting all the storylines and motives into our head, subtly tells us what is going on without being too cryptic about it. She gives us time during the longer scenes to absorb the previously seen and think about it.
And through this we have a highly emotional movie masked by a cold hearted murder spree. Every decision to convey the violence and action seemed fresh and right, even though there's not a lot to see in this movie.It's a movie consisting of basically 30 minutes of story, but instead of having overdrawn shootouts you get into the psyche of your main character portrayed so well by Joaquin Phoenix.The cherry on top is the score, which is quite scarcely used but everytime perfectly for the situation.The negative side of doing such a movie is of course the lack of an innovative story. Even though the dialogue is poignant and fitting it's definitely not a focus of the film.All in all, a highly enjoyable, intense and fresh movie.",You Were Never Really Here
310,sugar_n_spice_makes_ever,Overrated hype of trying to be something it wasn't,1,11 November 2019,"I appreciate the approach to this movie & what they were TRYING to portray to the audience, but my god, it's the most tedious style of direction & ones self story telling that I have ever seen; It's repetitive in more ways than one. Every new scene you await for is just dulled out with silence & close up camera shots, there's absolutely nothing fascinating about that when there's zero to learn from. The director, she was clearly trying to make this movie ""stay with you"" by using scenes of intensity & past traumatic stress from Phoenix, but what she hasn't realised is, the audience will not connect with the story telling or the lead person if the movie does not unravel itself or explain the reasons to what we do not understand. I swear to god, I was waiting and waiting for answers and literally nothing happens. I felt this movie was trying to be something that it wasn't; it just didn't work. There wasn't a slight crack of self-reveal. It was all really stiff & stale. I hate to admit it as Phoenix is such a brilliant method actor who brings so much depth to the screen, but no, this just wasn't it for me; something was really off about it? I really don't understand the whole talk on ""beautiful cinematography angles and shots"" I mean, really? Come off it, guys? I am a HUGE movie buff, but this doesn't even come close to the real deals. I am not one to slate movies and I try my best to enjoy them without being too picky and pointing out the little things, but again, its just some self indulgent story telling with no actual purpose. I did not once connect with 'Joe' I was waiting for it and literally, more than half way through the movie, still nothing. Joes character development was massively underdeveloped; there were some scenes where we had the chance to see that he was clearing suffering with mental health issues, but instead of feeling sorry for him, I just thought it was weird? Because again, the story telling wasn't at a good pace, it's jumping backwards and forwards, scenes did not fit each other. Not my cup of tea. At all.",You Were Never Really Here

312,augustkellerwrites,Vivid Masterpiece,10,4 June 2018,"There comes a point when a film is so elite in so many ways that it must be called a masterpiece. The absolutely electrifying gifts that both Lynne Ramsay and Joaquin Phoenix give us in You Were Never Really Here unite in such a way that is rarely seen in any medium. This work of art does everything it sets out to do and more; every shot is a painting, every sound is carefully chosen, and every moment brings the audience along in a way that knows better than we do. You Were Never Really Here is a film that doesn't mind being misunderstood on a surface level because it penetrates its viewers so deeply, it cannot be denied.From the very beginning, You Were Never Really Here displays its artful cinematography and disorienting sound as it takes us through the life of a broken man. Joaquin Phoenix disappears into his role and makes the viewers feel genuinely empathetic and completely terrified at the same time. The seamless and creative editing allows the audience to soak in his ugly life and feel his disjointed reality. This precision in every frame (artfully crafted by Ramsay), in each performance (all paced by Phoenix), and in each sound results in an experience that is unparalleled. I expect You Were Never Really Here to be in the discussion for Best Picture of the Year all year.Writing: 10/10

316,aileselfhallucination1981,The desire for suicide and life,8,30 September 2018,"The Scottish director, Lynne Ramsay, made a very quiet and disturbing film.
Most of Lynn's movies have that quiet side, as in a movie, ""We need to talk about Kevin"". and that's what gives her films a magical visual character, and make you enjoy it. this film talk about the ""Joaquin Phoenix"" the killer hack, who tries to save a little girl, and lives with his old mother, and very fun.
The basic story of the film is simple, but beyond the details, colors, and tranquility, there is another world of psychological and historical exhaustion suffered by Joaquin. the stages of his childhood, which was somehow harsh, and created this man. Joaquin swung between the desire to live and suicide for salvation, and it lasts for the duration of the film, even the last scene, Ramsey's making a moment, that Joaquin shoots his head, then we find out he was fancy dying.

Instead of a plot, what you have is a series of disjointed fragments which you try desperately to make sense of, but the task is hopeless.

It's a five stars only from me because it does have deep emotions and delicate contemplation into suicidal act/mentality from Joe. But that's about it.It's supposed to be a film where the villain pulls hatred from the audience (which it didn't do very well), which made it fairly weak when Joe punish them back with brute force (which was not much either). The camera seemed to be dodging all the necessary contact and it was really weird to watch (like if you don't want to show violence or sex you should probably avoid this topic). Joe's childhood was like a glimpse as well, not much detail was given (broken pieces here and there).The only memorable and powerful scene was the part where Joe's mum was choke and shot in the eye which was really infuriating and sad to watch because she didn't even take her glasses off and Joe had to remove them for her when (which brought back the good memory where she tricked him)..

The movie played on a variety of extremely bold themes that I found fascinating to explore, none of the characters were very deep but the script seemed to surround mostly Phoenix's character and his mother, so it makes sense nobody else would get much development. I really loved the way PTSD and the resulting mental degradation of it being left untreated were represented visually and through the main characters choices. I love how the only action scene in the movie was shot statically from voyeuristic angles and fit in the world of the movie, not handheld and shaky like you'd see in any other action flick. It ended on a depressing and unsure note, I really appreciate how the extras in the final scene were directed and written, it definitely sold the surreal and anxious feeling I imagine was meant to be expressed.

This works best during scenes of violence, where the director really conveys the feeling of violence: its randomness, intensity and ugliness. She does so rather artfully without an excess of gore - There are no Walking Dead headshots here. The same feeling is conveyed by the character's flashbacks, which are so clipped, sudden and striking as to leave us with a sense of PTSD. Except, I do wish they had dug deeper into Phoenix's background for a meatier reveal. The scenes in between all this increasingly suffer from prolonged shots of the character lost in the abyss of trauma past and present, his appearance increasingly disheveled, eyes locked in thought, to the point where we want to give the man a bottle of whiskey, a massage and a night off.

This is not a fast paced film and nor should it be, so if you love marvel and thats your go to, then don't waste you time with this film.
It is funny in a sad way that anyone could give this 1/10, they clearly have no idea that films can be art as well as entertaining.

339,John-564-342449,"Stylish art film damaged by lazy writing, choppy editing, boring music and an incomprehensible plot",5,17 June 2018,"I was very much looking forward to see this film, because I like Lynne Ramsay's work and was waiting for her masterpiece. In spite of the hype created by the critics after the Cannes 2017 screening and the 2 awards it won, this is actually one of her weaker films and - I hate to say it - it doesn't really work. Did the Cannes audiences see a different and better version? It was shown there as a work-in-progress, I read, but I don't know what was changed before the release. Seriously, how could this win 'Best Screenplay', if the story is nearly incomprehensible and suffers from lazy writing in some spots ? I understand, that Ramsay tried to tell her B-plot in an abstract and elliptical way, but this is no excuse for presenting us a basic plot, that is so far-fetched and so hard to understand, that I still have no real idea why all the murders happened. It's something about perverted politicians trading their young daughters like sex slaves and killing each other by using police units - or whatever. I didn't read the novel its based on. Wikipedia only offers a movie plot description that contains an obvious mistake, so that writer didn't understand it either... But it's not only the plot, that doesn't really make sense or satisfy in a dramatic way. The main character's actions don't follow any logic sometimes: 
He is characterized as a professional hitman with experience and an eye for detail at the beginning. He cleans up the blood and mess carefully and is very suspicious of everybody, because he doesn't want to get caught. So far so good. But why does he throw then his murder weapons and other evidence right outside of his room into a cleaning woman's garbage bin ? Because he's such a pro and so careful ? It doesn't make any sense. This pattern of stupid behavior, that no intelligent hitman worth his money would engage in, also happens later, when he is rescuing a young girl from a brothel. How does he do it ? He just buys a new hammer, doesn't care at all for the surveillance cams, doesn't use different clothes and doesn't even try to hide his face - he just walks in and hits multiple tough guys on the head and walks out with the girl. That's it. So, why should we believe that this man, who was characterized as a careful pro, would ever behave in such a foolish way ? And what was the purpose of the surveillance cams, if nobody tried to stop him ? Nothing of this makes sense and it's not justified through the character himself.Apart from these serious plot and story problems, the editing is so choppy
in the violent scenes, that the movie appears like a censored version of a much longer and much more brutal film that had to be cut down by an 
inexperienced editor. The cuts are sometimes jumpy, harsh and irritating. The editing doesn't succeed in creating an organic flow of images. The music is equally choppy and doesn't help in creating a film that feels like one coherent piece. The music styles and instruments are all over the place, but only some of it is compelling. The electronic music is uninspired and a boring cliché now. It's like Ramsay was trying to appeal to the same crowd that loved the 80's style of the overrated, but much more satisfying ""Drive"".Without the strong, but not perfect, cinematography, the creative sound design, the intense lead performance by Joaquin Phoenix and some poetic moments, this movie would be a total failure. It doesn't really work as a character piece or a thriller or a drama or an experimental art film, because it tries to be all of it at once, but is not really interested to explore anything of it in depth. The main character and story stay enigmatic, but not in a fascinating and satisfying way like in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"", which is an obvious reference point for Ramsay's painterly style. This film just feels unfinished and rough like a student work. I never 'bought' the criminal underground world that Ramsay showed us, because it doesn't look detailed and gritty enough. Comparsions with ""Taxi Driver"" are ridiculous, because this movie has none of that authenticity or realism. It seems to me that Lynne Ramsay either didn't do any research on her subject or simply wasn't too interested in a realistic portray of today's sex trade underworld. Older films like Neil Jordan's ""Mona Lisa"" or Paul Schrader's ""Hardcore"" offer much more gritty realism.Even the crude make-up effects look as unconvincing as in a student film. I can't remember the last time, I saw movie-blood looking like strawberry marmalade. Or slashed throats like they were created by a school theatre group. It's sub-par work and took me out of the story.All in all this was not a very entertaining experience and I can't imagine any audiences loving this movie. It has a few impressive qualities and plays in its best moments like a visual poetry clip, but it fails so totally as dramatic storytelling, that it could be used in film schools as an example of the limits of coherence, when you want to tell your story in more abstract ways. Similar movies like ""Léon, the Professional"" or ""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" are more traditional, but they work, while this is unfortunately just a failed attempt to create high-art out of pulpy material.",You Were Never Really Here

341,vladhxh,"A plus for cinematography, not much else",3,29 July 2018,"A movie almost uniformly loved by the critics. A movie that feels much longer than its 1hr 30m run-time. A movie, in which an ""assassin for hire"" plot is rehashed almost verbatim from countless other movies, although the story makes very little sense. It doesn't really matter though, as the director wants you to marvel at the beautiful (though empty and cold) scenery and feel for the tormented soul of the protagonist.Joaquin Phoenix seems to be able to play stoned, aggressive, inherently good but fundamentally broken types with his eyes closed. You can see that the guy in film is on some pretty strong anti-psychotic drugs, but it still feels like he is just massively stoned on a medicinal MJ. I really like Mr. Phoenix even if he plays a stoned, permanently depressed character who seems to feel deeply tortured even by simple stuff like cleaning a bathroom or just walking or driving. However, even his charisma cannot hold this movie together.What's definitely missing is a story that makes at least some sense. A congressman's daughter has gone missing. But somebody sent him an sms with a precise address of the hideout. The guy goes to a hired gun instead of police. The reason is sort of explained by the fact that he runs for office as a second guy to the current governor. Well, Joaquin, being a reliable workhorse, kills everyone and rescues the girl. And then all hell breaks loose, everybody around him violently dying. Here's the twist - the governor runs an underage brothel and actually kidnapped the congressman's daughter himself. Yep, it makes zero sense, even if you think that all politicians are evil creatures eating babies for breakfast.Apart from a deep neurosis of the main hero and a strange relationship with his mother, which is a result of a family trauma (and I think you can guess what the trauma is -- a deranged and violent father, how original!) -- there is nothing else in terms of a story.You can marvel at the cinematography, as the movie does look beautiful at times, and the soundtrack is often brilliant.

Phoenix is mesmerising, his past having shaped him into what he is today, but deeply buried residual decency along with his all consuming guilt / torment propels him towards saving Mina at all costs. It seemed he had found another being who had suffered like him and might understand him......I was touched they both counted backwards when they retreated into themselves at times of trauma.

Phoenix's skills with his hammer-of-choice speak to both his internal motivations, and the man he has grown to be, whilst in at least one sequence resembling a lo-fi echo of Old Boy. As the linear plot goes off the rails for anti-hero Joe, an unpleasant to watch film becomes even more so, and with all the fascination of watching the sterling work on the character the need to turn away becomes more and more.

No, Phoenix does the job for sure and will probably get a nomination for something or other by tapping into that darker side of his.
Overall, the movie reminds you of Taxi Driver crossed with The Professional watered down by, well, dullness. 
The monotony begins about halfway through the film as you begin to wonder when the will character buildup end and a story begin. 
A story that would be filled with exciting accounts of imaginary people and events told for sake of entertainment. Our entertainment after we have paid the price of admission.
Nope, You Were Never Really Here has none of that.
Wrong unless of course you are Mrs. Phoenix, a huge fan, or close relative of Joaquin Phoenix. Someone who exists for the purpose of glaring at the actors face on endless close-ups.

What a waste I thought. What a waste of a fine actor playing a really brutal bad guy, helping a good girl escape numerous well connected really bad guys. 
American viewers love a good contradiction right? The movie the Professional had it deadpan and held that idea until the credits rolled, but not here.

This picture is a ravishing gem, one of this year's best movies, and a personal favourite, simply because it paves the way for a new unprecedented genre: the dominant opinion inside an already polarised critic community is to classify this movie as a psychological drama - thriller, but this is a subject of controversy for me because of the flactuating nature of this film. At some points during this movie you would feel disattached, not by disinterest but by confusion, but at other times you can not get a hold of yourself watching this impressive movie. A true visual masterpiece and a breakthrough in the thriller genre, ""you were never really here"" probes into the twisted life and memories of joe, a ruthless new York based hitman who knows his ways through the city's juvenile brothels in order to search and retrieve missing girls. This very specific task that he masters brings him in conflict with major figures and puts him in the middle of a conspiracy that involves dishonesty, dishonour and inhumanity in a complex blend that adds to the exquisite action of the film a more refined sense, especially since all of the action scenes that were intentionally -due to budget cuts- hidden from the audience, leave a subtle feeling of unspoken violence and fear that infest the viewer's imagination making it a frightening experience and adding more to this film's intense suspense.However tempting this would be, talking only of the craftsmanship of this picture, it's elevating fright and it's wonderful cinematography would be a mistake of the highest orders, because Joaquin Phoenix's performance and his performance alone would made this movie transcend into a higher dimension of artistic innovation: Joe is one of the most complex and dark characters that were ever depicted on screen, a man of a tormented past and agonising present, someone who leads a quest of redemption after years of guilt-ridden ventures in shadowy governmental organisations and finds solace in dwelling inside new yorks' filthiest boroughs to retrieve the innocent and the unlucky. Such a man, with such a dense background and ambiguous intentions would be of the utmost difficulty to portray, and this is what made mr.Phoenix's performance so moving and so iconic, an acting worthy of all my lauding and by far the year's best performance! Cruel though it may seem, this picture is also a heartwarming film about forgiveness, reform and compassion and even though it encompassed all sorts of violent and gloomy twists and metaphors, it is a must see for anyone who would love to watch a good movie, one that discusses problematics that reside in the heart of our sinful and greed laden society, that delivers its fair share of masterful action and exhausting anticipation and shows once and for all that Lynne Ramsey is unarguably one of Hollywood's finest directors: as a pioneer in a new enthralling genre, she deserves more than recognition for its greatest work, yet",You Were Never Really Here

We the viewer must watch and sometimes interpret what is happening since the film has little dialogue but I believe that great film try to show visually instead of relying on dialogue creating a well balance between the visual and the dialogue.Now cinematography, some shots are beautifully shot like the scene where he walks out holding the little girl or the scene where he is under water even when a character has a bag over their head trying to suffocateJoaquin phoenix does an excellent job portraying Joe as a man with a traumatic past. His physical appearances fits well with his character. The contrast between the dark emotions and his caring attitude towards his mother gives him a third dimensional feel.The filmmakers were not scared to make bold choices by raising the stakes to the maximum.

It festers in your subconscious that you can't help but think about it more and more until it finally bursts and you came to a conclusion on what it all meant...until you hear a theory that makes sense that you go mad about if your interpretation is right or if the other person's interpretation is about! That is definitely a high compliment!Joaquin Phoenix gives a great performance. I won't go as far as to call it his finest work, but he does carry this movie and understands a lot of this character and what the film is getting at. Phoenix is like a chameleon whenever he takes a role. You buy who the character is instead of seeing Joaquin Phoenix, and I bought such an interesting and unique character. Lynne Ramsey also deserves a lot of credit. This is the first movie I seen from her, knowing her from her previous film We Need to Talk About Kevin, one that's been on my watchlist for the longest time.

Every shot in this film is crisp and polished, and you get transported in what feels like another world, one that is alien-like but also intense and eerie. There's an atmosphere in this film that is just so off-putting you can't help but be sucked in. A large thanks to this goes to Radiohead's Johnny Greenwood working on the movie score (although it doesn't beat his work with PTA), benefiting with the other worldly score composition. All of which benefits from the brain chewing story where you aren't truly sure what is going on. Like mentioned before, there are so many layers and theories to mull over that it just entices you to truly learn more about what exactly is going on, which makes for a great watch that will surely benefit the more you watch it.There are a few issues I did take with this film. For one, the first act is pretty sluggish. It takes a while until the movie really gets going, but the first act of the film feels more like a slog to get through. Another issue, and admittingly this one is more nit-picky on my end but I know some would take issue with this, is that it is obvious when people aren't being hit.Overall, great movie and definitely one I'll be thinking about for a while now. I know this isn't a movie for everyone, so I will say is that if you are interested in watching a slow but interesting psychological crime thriller that will make you ponder, then give this a watch!",You Were Never Really Here

It's nearly impossible to believe this movie is LESS than 90 minutes because it seemed to go on forever and it just wouldn't make its POINT!90% of the violence of this movie is implied and/or shown after the fact. We don't really see Joe pounding people's heads in. We see them lying on the floor with a reddish hole in their head and maybe some blood on the floor.Nothing is explained. We have no idea HOW the people who need Joe find him. We have no idea why or if the Senator initially ALLOWS the governor to molest his kid. We don't know and are never told how DEEP the sympathetic father is into this sex trafficking. We have no idea WHY a pedophile would choose to become a sitting governor, given the inherent risks in such a predilection, nor why his sworn detail would not only enable him, but murder on his behalf.You have to have a seriously dark opinion of not just elected officials, but every facet of our society.To avoid going on and on, I'm just going to say, the entire world created by this screenwriter and director is patently unbelievable and a disgusting place I would never choose to visit again.My two stars are too generous!",You Were Never Really Here

375,raphaellecat,"""an unconventional revenge thriller""",8,2 October 2018,"Not having seen any of director Lynn Ramsay's work, this film might seem at times peculiar and odd, but whilst the story itself is a rather common one, the way it is told veers in a very unorthodox pattern. Joaquin Phoenix plays Joe, a hired bounty who tracks down missing girls. His brutal techniques makes him a desirable agent, but when the next job unveils a massive conspiracy, his path is split between suicide or awakening. A thoroughly damaged and flawed character, Joaquin Phoenix portrays Joe with such relentlessness, giving him even deeper complexities and outweighing the film's abstract narrative to give a truly defined performance. What Lynn Ramsay accomplishes here, if not for her own take of a revenge thriller, is how she depicts violence on screen. The common thread for illustrating brutality in film, in a simple manner, is to show it, however, to do it effectively, is not to show it. Lynn Ramsay meticulously stages sequences that would seem horrific to the viewer's eyes, but leaving it to the viewer's imagination causes a far more violent picture.You Were Never Really Here is a concoction of very particular ingredients and is likely not to be everyone's cup of tea but it does leave it's mark, giving us one of Joaquin's finest performances to date, and for that reason alone, it should be indulged.",You Were Never Really Here

380,Vlasios_Tzomos,"Pros and cons of ""You Were Never Really Here""",7,5 July 2018,"Pros:
Direction 8/10 (Ramsay made a brutal, grim and dark thriller... you have a sense that you are inside Joe's head... and Ramsay doesn't manipulate how we are supposed to feel about her antihero... in my opinion one of the most significant British directors)
Joaquin Phoenix 8/10 (Another peculiar character portrayed well by Phoenix... he is at his best lately)
Music 7/10 (Greenwood's score creates an atmosphere of dread)
Production 7/10 (The producers gave creative freedom to Ramsay)
Cons:
Scenario 5/10 (Sparse dialogue, lack of traditional narrative structure and disjointed edits are giving points to those who are complaining about a boring movie... It also reminded me of Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"", war veteran who cleans New York city from criminals and a saviour of teenage girls, who gets involved in a political scandal)",You Were Never Really Here
381,hudson-todd,Grimly Beautiful,8,10 April 2019,"A film that manages to be grim and violent while being visually beautiful at the same time. Intentionally minimalistic in terms of dialogue, it instead relies on visual storytelling to great effect. Director Lynne Ramsay deserves recognition for this. Joaquin Phoenix is at his charismatic best (he emotes on such a subtle but powerful level) and young Ekaterina Samsonov mirrors him well, both of them portraying the flattened affect of the traumatized with hints of tenderness in their connection with one another. Greenwood's score is appropriately ethereal and contemplative.",You Were Never Really Here
382,Whoah10115,The film of the year,10,15 March 2019,"Comparisons to Taxi Driver are understandable, if not wholly accurate. The film is more literal, which shouldn't lead you to believe it's literal, because it's not.Greenwood's score is intense and paranoid, and it's loud. Therein lies the main difference between this film and the aforementioned classic, which constantly bubbles beneath the surface, to the point of near overflow.Ramsey's film is more ostensibly focused, beaming with unbelievable intensity thru the eyes of one of our great actors, Joaquin Phoenix. A hunk of mass in this film, sludging around and carrying the weight of something so poignant and deeply felt. His eyes, more forceful than ever (see him when he makes his way), leads to one of the best performances of the decade.The film moves thru the violence and thru violence. There is no sentiment, but rather weariness, and a somber that reveals quiet dignity and an existential nightmare that never ends.I haven't written anything close to a review in a long time, so I'm struggling to write this better; I've struggled more to forget this film.Certain things cannot be escaped. You Were Never Really Here stays with you.",You Were Never Really Here
383,DocEphraimBates,You Were Never Really Going Anywhere,1,23 April 2018,"I like artsy movies. I like movies that make me think outside the box a little. I was hoping this would be one of them. However, at the halfway point of the movie I really, REALLY had to talk myself into watching the second half of this flick. Sometimes bad movies have decent endings a la Den of Thieves. I was hoping for that with this one.
NOPE!You Were Never Really Here seemed to go on longer than the extended cut of Dune, but it was less than an hour and thirty minutes. I even sat through the credits because I thought there might be something else at the end. Whoever wrote the review ""It leaves you wanting more"" hit the nail right on the head. I was definitely wanting more...like a plot and some acting and something remotely faster than the crippled snail's pace that this movie offered. I went through here and read a lot of the reviews, and almost all of them were 3 stars or less, so I'm not sure how the overall rating on this thing is a 7.1?? Yeah, I really lost 90 good minutes of my Friday night.On the upside, I will say this: If a doctor ever tells me that I only have 90 minutes to live, I'm going to watch this movie again...because it lasts FOREVER!",You Were Never Really Here

389,anishchari,Decent thriller hampered by Art-House style decisions,6,15 July 2018,"With a cryptic title and an artsy cover, you would be rightly suspicious that You Were Never Really Here isn't going to be a traditional Man on Fire/Taken/John Wick movie.
Joaquin Phoenix is certainly intimidating in his best Karl Marx expression, but much of the on screen violence is off screen. He'll approach a guard with a ball-peen hammer, then they'll cut away and return to the collapsed and bleeding body on the ground. It's not an action movie really, more of a thriller involving a pedophile ring and a prominent politician. However most scenes are punctuated by flashbacks from Joaquin's troubled childhood and past. None of this is gone into detail, and the director tries to let the visuals do the story telling. But these frequent interjections detract from the story to the point I had myself thinking this movie has been going on for an hour and hardly anything has happened. There are plentiful long, still takes of Joanquin sitting down; pondering and agonizing. It's emotive but can slow things to a crawl.You Were Never Really Here is too artsy for its own good. It tries to be a decent thriller but overloads the script with too much innuendo and art-house to make for a compelling movie.",You Were Never Really Here

This has to be one of the best crime thrillers I've ever seen.The plot was amazing, even though before I'd seen the movie I was very worried it would quickly digress to the typical Hollywood reliance on gruesome shock value and a misuse of a purulent visualization young girls. There was none of that.Violence was there for sure, but it was dealt with in a much more Hitchcock directorial way. Kudos to the director, who did not rely on the typical blood and gore. Also, it was obvious what the young girls must have been going through, none of us needs to visualize any of it to know it was horrible, especially survivors of abuse.Joaquin Phoenix is a very remarkable actor and pulls off an Oscar performance.

For what its worth, the abrupt ending left me wanting more, although a circle had obviously been closed (still, there was plenty of more to see in the character, now that he was... ""really here"" and actually conscious).Phoenix is absolutely brilliant as the disillusioned protagonist who is tormented by his past, and now hits back at the cruel and violent world that haunted him. He should get an Oscar nomination at the very least.""You Were Never Really Here"" is a great mix of reality and delusion, driven by the central character's recurring past traumatic experiences. Perpetuation of violence in a cynical world is the main theme, and it's depicted in a very inspired and original way thanks to the top notch direction and spectacular photography (some stylish scenes are able to convey powerful feelings and messages in a far more effective way than a conventional narration would ever do).When the tension escalates, this slow-burn psychological/revenge thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat; the skillful use of editing and music really help on that aspect.Ramsay was fun, down to earth and answered many questions afterwards.",You Were Never Really Here

I felt the pre-release/promo Taxi Driver nods were a little unnecessary but I guess people were going to make that association themselves given the content, so it made sense to put it out there early. Comparing YWNRH to Taxi Driver will leave most people underwhelmed however & that would be unfair to a film that, imo, has a lot of heart & speaks a lot of truth.

He's found a niche - albeit one that feeds his dysfunctional coping lifestyle - in the form of a ""hired gun"" whose job it is to retrieve young girls from the depths of hell in the form of child sex trafficking. The film is compelling. The issues are relevant. Explored, also, are the sometimes sickening disconnections between public achievement and dangerous personal traumas.I wish the film would have provided a bit more commentary on how Phoenix' character went on to process the madness, but, as with other decisions in the film, those realizations were only subtly told to the viewer as images or intimations.All in all, this is a solid film.

On the other hand, while the way this movie was filmed did manage to maintain my attention for the most part, especially with the scenes in which Joe roams the house to save the girl, the ''unconventional'' cinematography and directing end up stretching the film out and, in the end, together with the really weak plot, they might probably make you feel bored.

But there so much violence and yet so much non of it. And props to the directing monster Lynne Ramsay whose eyes finds intersting ways to place the camera just to take the best possible emotion out of it (ex. the hallway raid).And the score (jonny greenwood) is marvelous, forever altering so it can match or pose an antifasis to the ongoing events.It's a must see for 2018.",You Were Never Really Here

438,lm_meireles,A new Phoenix,9,5 January 2019,"We hear a man aggressively speaking to someone else, with the voice-over of what seems to be a girl counting backwards. We can't see nothing yet, only dark. The man, then, begins like the girl: ""43, 42, 41, 40, 39, 38, 37"". ""You must do better. You must do better!"": he says. I guess he could only be talking to himself.The first thing we see is the creepy image of someone desperately breathing inside a plastic bag. A flashback of a child hits. A man burns the photograph of a girl and throws it into a bucket together with a bible, takes off a plastic of a fire alarm, cleans up the blood of a ball-peen hammer and collects small items laying in a bed into a white bag (we can clearly see a necklace similar to the one used on Ramsay's Morvern Callar (2002) and duct tape). He hesitates before leaving the hotel room where we were until now. If you read the synopsis, by now, you already know: his job's done for today.We get some hints of what he looks like, but not before he leaves a guy spitting blood on the floor. He's brutal. He takes a cab down to the airport, whose driver ironically sings the movie's title. There, he calls his boss, John, and confirms what we have guessed right away: ""It's done."".When he returns home, a kid notices him and tells his friend to hide. Our man noticed him too. He lives with and takes care of his old demented mother, who calls him by the name of Joe. Scars are seen all over his body: we learn his tormented past. Flashbacks hit again.He reaches the local grocery store where his contact, Angel, works, in order to pick up last job's payment and to warn him that his son saw him. He surely doesn't want to be known.By the time our plot gets started, the camera shows the half hidden bruised face of a woman, starring at Joe, while both wait at a train station.He's about to meet with his nose bleeding boss, who tells him about how his deceased woman loved flowers. ""Angel's out."": they agree. Like a little boy, he eats candy balls while lying on the couch and complains about not founding green ones, the ones he likes the most. When he finds one, smashes it with his fingers: is Miss Ramsay trying to tell us something about him? We'll find out later on.His new job involves a Senator's daughter, who's been missing since her mother killed herself: how tragic are the lives of our characters? Although he looks distracted, Joe tells his boss he's listening, while he's dissecting the job's details. When John starts talking about leisure and futile stuff, Joe turns off: he's the kind of guy that only focuses on his work, but does he care about the morals of it, though? Is he able to understand (or even relate to) the pain of those who he's saving? Does he care about his own brutality on the disgusting pedos?The director intelligently takes us back to the station. We suddenly remember about the mysterious woman. Who is she? Maybe she was never really there...What we ultimately get is a movie about a sad, mentally unstable, traumatized man, whose self-inflicted pain never seems to be enough. He has a very close relationship with his mother and from there comes what, personally, was the picture's core emotional side. Joaquin Phoenix plays an important role, as he captures the essence of that man on a (well, another!) masterful performance. Will he ever free himself and turn his days into ""beautiful days""?I won't reveal the plot, but I can say that not much happens, at least in the eyes of those who like complicated double-crossing type of stories. This is a much sophisticated movie - forget about cliché talk and twists -, although some have the courage to call it ""garbage"".I really enjoyed how the director used such an anxious score and rough editing (constant flashbacks are heavy part of it) to makes us, too, nervously engaged with the story and characters.When I first watched this, I wasn't yet aware of the Taxi Driver comparisons (yes, we can all see the similarities). It didn't really hit me that way, though, maybe because I was too distracted thinking about other movies, e.g., Drive (2011) - essentially given the protagonist's silent but masterful introduction - or No Country for Old Men (2007) - resembled by Ramsay's thrilling action and clever way to hide most of the movie's shocking violence. Also, I was clueless about Lynne Ramsay's work, so I went on after to see her other features.When I further read the self-indulgent/pretentious comments regarding Ramsay, I laughed. She likes to put personal elements in her cinema and possesses her defined style: isn't she in her own right?I can't humbly understand those who complain about the ""slow"" pace throughout the movie: I felt like it wasn't slow, that if I'd blink, I'd be missing something important. I've seen myself stuck to the screen, mostly because Miss Ramsay made me feel obliged to do it.We had Morvern, Eva - We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011) - and now we have Joe. It is quite fair to say that Lynne Ramsay is a master, and she might just be the master of the traumatized ones.",You Were Never Really Here

Was that his dad? How did he and his mom escape that attack? Was it a one time thing or was is an on-going thing?Lastly, they make him ex-military and then give him some damaged body parts, specifically his shoulder.

446,DoctorKingSchultz,Character Study in the Truest Sense,8,14 April 2018,"You Were Never Really Here is a film whose marketing and narrative might have gotten the better of it. The promise of Joaquin Phoenix as a brutal lone wolf on the tail of criminals, and promotional imagery and hype speaking to the film's hardcore violence (""#DropTheHammer"") might propose 2018's Man on Fire (2004), or even the year's arthouse thriller, a la Drive (2011.) Disappointment among some of the entirely-negative reviews on IMDb find the film boring, or slow, or both, or incomprehensible, or whatever it might be. To say these opinions are ""wrong"" would be illogical, instead, they're more misguided than anything.Phoenix's Joe is a man who, we've heard it before, is haunted by his past. Lynne Ramsay, the film's director, fleshes the damaged hero archetype out to extremes rarely seen or felt, and for that reason alone ...Really Here deserves attention. Joe is an avenger, a righter of wrongs, but his is a sad existence. Through flashbacks verging on horror film snippets, we see Joe to have been the subject of verbal, physical, and perhaps sexual abuse by a brutal father, or father figure. Daddy issues a cliche? Sure, but the way Ramsay jolts the audience with abrasive cries for help or flashes of domestic horror, you're truly transported into a sort of nightmare, one that isn't excessive, visually or sonically, but rather one that is ever-present while we trudge the streets of downtown New York and some of the city's deceptively-residential burroughs, passing the sort of people one passes on the streets. Ramsay populates her locations with believable people, leading believable lives.""Believable"" is perhaps the best way to describe Phoenix's performance, and the Joe character. He has a heavy walk, not a slick one; his clothes are baggy and unfashionable, the kind of person you see who isn't homeless, who is able to eat and has a roof over his head, but is checked out of this plane of existence, pushing forward out of stubborn nihilism. And that's ultimately what the film is about; a man who perseveres through a personal hell for no discernible reason, looking for some grip on his existence. Joe's been guided by exterior forces his whole life: His abusive childhood leaves him with deep emotional scars, evident in his suicidal tendencies (scenes of Phoenix asphyxiating in an attempt at some sort of high are horrifying); his family's military history, briefly hinted in the form of a uniform in a closet during a flashback, sets him up for that career; the war-fighting, and what seem to be subsequent jobs (police officer, maybe? security of some sort?) leave physical damage and even more horrible images, seared into the mind; and then at the end of the film's episode, in an attempt at some catharsis, he can't even receive the satisfaction, the closure, of killing the man we've come to be decide as responsible for the events of the film. Joe is strung along from abuse to abuse, though our final moments with him are, ultimately, optimistic.I've avoided explicit detail of the story, though I will address the alleged difficulty some have with following it, whether because of the abrupt editing or Phoenix's mumbled dialogue. You Were Never Really Here presents a story that serves as more of a background we can frame Joe against. It provides the underworld hellscape and plot devices (shady contacts with money in envelopes, brutal sex traffickers, corrupt politicians, etc) we're familiar with so that we have a context for Joe's world and experiences. While not irrelevant, the story is there to serve the idea of Joe as a person, rather than string the audience along. In what feels like too long a review, I've not even mentioned Thomas Townend's cinematography (it looks good, though is nothing mind-blowing) or Jonny Greenwood's terrific score, varying between synth pulses that will instill the hardcore crime genre, as well as more soothing, traditional chords. I've not mentioned the soundscape and layering of dialogue, between the flashbacks and Joe's walks through the bustling streets. The relationship between Joe and his Mother (Judith Roberts) I've left entirely undiscussed, and that too is a crucial pillar of what makes the film worthwhile (to this I say, read someone else's analysis!) I've ignored all this in a minor attempt to help some understand that the film isn't particularly exciting; the violence is brutal yet detached, the major events of the story don't surprise or intrigue, they simply occur. Lynne Ramsay's film is literary in the way is subjects the audience to a perspective and tries, subtly, to have them understand what breaks a man and pushes him to being capable of violence. And in this I'd say it succeeds.",You Were Never Really Here
447,tim-arnold-987-145031,I Was Never Really There Either,2,10 April 2018,"I realize it was going for the Taxi Driver for a new millennium, and I suppose from an art film perspective it probably did it for a lot of people. I just found Phoenix's portrayal to be a little tedious. It's probably just me, but films with minimal dialogue tend to make me want to check out almost as quickly as films with subtitles. In foreign language films, I grow weary of having to read dialogue and feel like I cannot focus on the visual aspects of a film. In a similar vein, minimal dialogue films force me to closely study the smallest incidental visual aspects of a film to winnow out storyline and character development. Joaquin Phoenix alone should have been a warning to me that this was going to be an oddball film, and it certainly delivered on that level. However it was just slow and exhausting in my opinion and left me bored 30 minutes into the film. Sort of glad IMDb got rid of their review response threads.

451,arminbilefield,You Were Never Really Here,9,8 April 2018,"Contains Spoilers:What a beautiful piece of art, the good goes against evil in this film. The good being Joe and the bad being a lot of other people. The film has a lot of similarities with Taxi Driver, but while it carries the similarities with itself, it delivers it's own original identity in a flawless way. Lynne Ramsay's script put together with Joaquin Phoenix's performance and Johnny Greenwood's absolutely superb soundtrack, delivers to you one of the most beautiful movies of the decade, for your own and this movie's sake don't jump to conclusions with this one and give it time; for me the movie really took life in the water sequence where Joe tries to commit suicide while drowning his mom's body, but as he is in the middle of drowning he suddenly sees Nina, drowning with him. Noticing that drowning himself would automatically drown Nina too, since she has nobody to save her, and thinking she isn't strong enough to do it herself. He goes back for Nina, he kills the security guards goes inside but sees that Nina saved herself, what he may not notice at that moment was that he was the one who gave her the power to fight back and save herself, but he thinks that he just added another not-so pleasant event to the girls life making her kill someone but she assures him ""It's okay Joe, it's okay"". Because Joe might not notice it but Nina seems to notice that Joe is a nice guy, actually he is a sweetheart, he holds the hand of the guy that killed her mom when he's dying and is scared, for christ's sake.
Both leaves the house not knowing after all of this disturbing events will they be able to just get on with their lives? that thought is seen in the diner, where Joe shoots himself in the head while shedding two tears (a reverse type of De Niro's famous scene at the end of the Taxi Driver where he has a smile on his face a few moments before his death). If the movie ended there, Ramsay would imply that in between all of this darkness there is no brightness, it can't be found. But the movies tricks you, with Nina coming back we understand that Joe's asleep and that scene was simply just a dream, and with Nina's dialogue ""Let's go, It's a beautiful day"" Joe wonders, maybe it is a beautiful day, maybe he can put the disturbing past of his childhood with his abusive dad and the incidents of his work away. And when he sees that even if there is all of this darkness in this world you can still see the light, because you are the one who has the power and you are the one who chooses and understands without all of this darkness, the brightness would not have any meaning; and he confirms Nina, ""It is a beautiful day outside"" creating one of the most beautiful endings of cinema.

454,kitcatch,A Disturbing Work of Art,9,3 April 2019,"A fantastic, beautiful, and disturbing look into the mind of a deeply traumatized man. If you haven't experienced or studied the effects of ptsd and depression some of this movie will probably confuse you. The film is an incredibly accurate and powerful representation of what it like to live with that suffering. The silent pain that you live with every second of every day that is unrecognizable to even those closest to you, the suicidal thoughts that come into your mind constantly throughout the day to the point you don't even think about them anymore, the struggle to find a reason to keep going. All of these are feelings are presented to you unfiltered and unexplained, so if you don't know what you're looking at then you'll probably end up thinking this movie sucks. Trust me, it doesn't.In the early parts of the film we are shown quick little slices of what made Joe this way, they aren't flashbacks though, they are his thoughts at any given moment. He is constantly tormented by the traumatic experiences he has endured. The quick subway platform scene in particular really stood out to me, here Joe is just going to work basically, a normal every day task and the thought of ending his life just pops into his head, it doesn't even faze him, he almost joking plays with the idea and then moves on.The best and also most beautiful scene in the movie was the scene in which Joe lays his mother to rest in the river with the intention of dying beside her, but then he remembers the girl and changes his mind. In that moment Joe has lost his reason living, he had to be alive to take care of his mother and if he killed himself, it would end his suffering but it would be the cause of hers. Also, he nought only lost his reason, he failed at it, he was supposed to take care of his mother, instead she was murdered because of him. He had nothing left and was ready to die when he remembered the girl, he latched onto that thought and found a new reason.Then we get to the end of the story and Joe finds that the girl has saved herself and doesn't need him to protect her, that thought completely breaks him. He takes the girl to a diner for breakfast and he fantasizes about shooting himself and no one even noticing but the girl asks if he is alright and it snaps him out of it and makes him realize someone does care about him and he still has a reason to live.",You Were Never Really Here

Although, It had a similar slow artsy pacing about it, the dialogue, plot, and pacing were far more interesting than this movie.",You Were Never Really Here
466,ebamovies,Artsy and boring version of Taken??,3,27 January 2020,"Here is a movie idea:
Someone is thinking of making a tea- show this for 3 minutes with extravagant shots of surrealist cinematography
Person decides to make the tea and starts making it. : close up of the kettle and the smoke.
He stirs the tea gently but with full of thoughts and contemplation of life that him stirring this tea is just like life stirring him around and round. Close up of everything. Maybe a shot of totally random guy walking the street. Mailman. Dead bird.And then a simple story of something totally irrelevant....do I get a mention at the Sundance or Cannes because I used close up shots and I make a movie that is not a blockbuster????Whoever praised this movie and brought it to 6.8 obviously have done so just to make sure that it's level with marvel and Disney films.
This is a boring take of a life that is a vigilante. And we don't get to watch him do his best work. We don't get to hear him talk that much. We don't even really understand what happened. But it happens with very looooooong shots of one thing...literally one thing every 5 minutes. The movie is 100 minutes and first 30 of it we just don't get is he suicidal or sick or both?It's the prequel to Joker of 2019 that nobody asked for. If Terrence Malick(close enough) and Terry Gilliam(close enough) made a love child director, that director hired an assistant to take notes and then that assistant lost those notes. Someone found those notes and decided to be a director. She used the notes for papier-mâché without reading them. That person directed this project.
This is what I think of this movie and the director of it.",You Were Never Really Here

However, my belief that most anything with Joaquin Phoenix in it( with the exception of ""I'm Still Here"" ,mostly because I cannot stand Casey Affleck and he was part of that charade ) is usually a decent film reeled me in. 
 To be fair, if I would have paid full price for this movie , I would been ticked. Since it was only a renta, I didn't walk away from the screen feeling like someone had stolen my money . 
 Having said that, the movie was just ok ,in my opinion . There was enough suspense and twists to keep me guessing. Joaquin Phoenix was excellent ,as usual, at making me have compassion and empathy for someone who brutally kills people for a living . 
 The music kind of stressed me out , which is probably what it was meant to do , so props for that. 
 All in all , fans of Joaquin will probably find this worth the rental ,even if you are not into abstract murderish stuff.
 I can't say it profoundly changed me ,or even entertained me. It did ,however ,make me think about those who do horrible things for a living. What makes them ok with doing that kind of thing? Is it extreme violence in their past ? Or does being at War further desensitize people to killing and make it easier to go there? Especially when they are going after ""the bad guys ""? Is there any hope for these people? Or for those who love them? Where do they all end up?

476,blankme,Unsatisfying,5,5 October 2019,"Where to start? The acting is the best part of this but what there is of the plot has too many holes. I can buy that the main character could become a vigilante of sorts whose raison d'etre is rescuing young girls from traffickers albeit this wasn't entirely for altruistic reasons as he was paid. Joe is then engaged by a US Senator to rescue his daughter and return her from where she is being prostituted after being kidnapped. Now if you were in such an important position as a US Senator and your 13 year old daughter had been kidnapped and you knew where she was would you A) Involve FBI or B) Hire a vigilante?But it gets more real because our hero Joe rescues the girl only to learn on TV that this Senator has apparently killed himself right before security forces come knocking on the door snatch the girl back and attempt to kill him which he dodges.. He then tries to get in touch with several contacts who all been mysteriously killed until he ends up home where he finds his mother has been killed also but the killers are in the house still. He shoots both of them but one is still alive conscious and quite talkative ans informs him that senator Williams snatched the girl back because she was his favourite. So off Joe goes and manages to get into Senator Williams property where he finds the senator with a slashed throat and the girl with blood on her eating dinner. They then ride off into the sunset together.No one apparently missed the daughter of the senator and no one questioned where she was not her school, friends or family and there were no security people at Senator Williams house either or CCTV alarms etc noting this couple leaving his property.

The plot feels like it was chosen by a dice or a ""random plot generator app"".
The film consists of awfully long shots in which nothing happens (e.g. Joaquin Phoenix staring out of a bus window for 5 minutes).
If you want to display mental illness then focus on the character. If you want a movie about pedophilia then chose a string plot.

It pulled me in front the start and didn't let go till literally the last minute. It moves very slow but felt frantic at the same time. The score was epic, fitting every scene perfectly. The music throughout spanned all spectrums of my emotions. I felt everything from rage to empathy and everything in between. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was brilliant. Arguably his best performance ever. Despite the minimalist character development it felt like I completely knew and understood the pain and emotions behind the character Joe. His character was so dark in such a satisfying way. The young girls character in the film was perfectly acted making you feel sad for her but also hopeful. She spoke very few words but each word was intelligent and well crafted. The violence was brutal and heavy but it never felt like a violent movie. The cinematography created an underlying tone so dark yet made me feel so at home in the darkness. I found myself without an ounce of remorse wanting to see everyone involved get brutally murdered.

497,ajwh-53593,Hypnotic but forgettable,7,17 March 2018,"A very, very good film; unsettling, dark, provocative, great acting and cinematography. But would I watch it again? I'm not sure I would.Herein lies the problem: this film didn't leave a lasting impression on me, there were no real lingering emotions. Understandably it's been compared to Taxi Driver but I didn't feel this film had the same raw, explosive energy and intensity. It's just a very accomplished and stylish film. There's nothing wrong with that, that in itself makes it a film worth seeing, but often critics applaud style over substance, so I'm not sure it's fully deserving of all the praise it's been receiving.There's no doubt that Lynne Ramsay has done a superb job and there were several scenes I loved for their cleverness, detail and originality. Phoenix is astonishing and squeezes out every last dust particle of Joe's shattered being. I've heard Ramsay say she saw Joe as someone with a head full of broken glass, and that's certainly conveyed in the film. But I felt there was a bit too much inner turmoil. It felt a little bit too drawn out for me. It could've done with more changes in tempo and a greater range of emotions. There was dark humour but it was all a bit too glum. Yes, I get the film deals with very dark subject matter but I want films to put me through the ringer, play with my expectations, take me on a roller coaster ride. Although this had lots of emotional depth to it, it was one-note. The last scene didn't alter that for me.You Were Never Really Here will be loved by cinephiles and there's a lot to admire about it so it's definitely worth watching, but ultimately, it falls short of a masterpiece, as some have proclaimed it. I liked it whilst I watched it, but after exiting the cinema, it felt like I'd never really been there either. 7.5/10.",You Were Never Really Here

501,lempkecoleton,Ignore Negative 5 and Under Reviews,7,28 January 2019,"I saw mixed reviews for You Were Never Really Here and it made me put off watching this film for 2 years. That was a mistake to say the least. YWNRH is a fantastically shot, gripping stray away from your typical blockbuster crime drama. While this movie isn't perfect, most negative reviews I've seen for this movie are nonsense. This movie is more than worth the hour and a half runtime regardless of whether or not you're typically drawn to the genre. Without spoilers, this review will tell you what you can expect, give you pros and cons, and debunk the faulty overwhelmingly negative reviews some people gave it.Don't believe the reviews saying there is a ""nonexistent, boring plot"". The people who think that are the people who need a plot spoon fed to them with in your face exposition and unrealistic, unnecessary character dialogue so they can follow along without having to pay attention. Not only is the plot very clear, it's also very well written. While I'm not sure I would call this movie a thriller, it is a gripping, gritty, crime drama. The plot, despite not being battered into the front of your brain, is straightforward and easy to follow. A man suffering from several traumatic life experiences bides his time finding, and avenging missing girls in an attempt to find peace within himself. Initially, you are left in the dark regarding the main character. His character is developed throughout the story via fragmented displays of flashbacks chopping up his daily life. Through this you simultaneously gather information regarding his daily life, his occupation, his past, and his motives. I believe the way these flashbacks are used are why some people incorrectly believe there is a weak or incomplete plot, but to be frank they couldn't be more wrong.The use of flashbacks in this movie is not only masterful, but incredibly unique. They are not given to the viewer in their entirety, and they are not meant to give us the entire picture on Joaquin Phoenix's background. They give you enough to understand him, but serve to convey a more important point. The use of these choppy, fragmented flashbacks seen from the main characters perspective convey the hardships of daily life for someone suffering from traumatic experiences. Constantly being reminded of something they'd like to forget, but can't. The seamless and uncontrollable drift from present to the past triggered by random occurrences encountered in day to day life that takes a toll on a person. The director did a phenomenal job conveying this with her technique, while also creating a complete character.This film is also incredibly well shot. While I'm sure someone could reference several influences this movie draws from I was taken aback at how unique each scene is in how it is shot. This movie strays from the norm and does it extremely well. This individuality not only creates very powerful, gripping, exciting scenes, but makes it easy to focus on less exciting, build up scenes as well. If only based on cinematography I would give this film a 10/10.While the pros of this movies far outweigh the cons, no movie is perfect. One critique I have is that some of the audio during Joaquin's flashbacks is so quiet I would've completely missed it had I had the subtitles off. Because, as I referenced earlier, the flashbacks are incredibly fragmented each second really counts when establishing the main characters background. Without subtitles, while the quiet, layered audio creates a nice effect to describe the feeling in the main characters head, you lose some relatively important exposition to truly help you understand his past. It's not major and doesn't take away from anything, but it's a critique nonetheless. Same goes for dialogue in a few important character interactions. You really can't fall asleep for a second during this movie if you want to get every detail. I had to rewind another scene that wasn't a flashback just because I missed someone's name. Again, not a deal breaker, doesn't change the plot, but would slightly change your understanding if you missed it.Overall I give this movie somewhere between a 7/8 out of ten. The only thing holding it back from a 8/9 or a 9/10 was a few minor plot holes at the end. Nothing major, especially when compared to the gargantuan plotholes most Hollywood blockbusters ignore these days, but I'm nitpicky and watch too much CinemaSins on YouTube. Great movie I would highly recommend to anyone.",You Were Never Really Here

Phoenix's and Samsonov's performances are spellbinding, Greenwood continues his streak of stupendous scores, and the editing is so strong that the film probably wouldn't work with a lesser effort. The cinematography is excellent as well, providing several shots that work incredibly even just as stills.The character writing is superb and, along with the violent set-pieces, form the meat of the film. If you enjoy Nicolas Winding-Refn, you'll like this film quite a bit.

The characters are bland, their relationships are unexciting, large parts of the story are left unexplained, JP's character doesn't offer much in terms of someone to root for and the direction of the movie comes across as pretentious as opposed to artistic due to the glaring failures with the rest of the movie.

He is more suicidal and sad than angry, while trying to rescue a girl, that has been captured in a world that unfortunately really exists. 
Child trafficking is a serious issue worldwide and often involves people, you and me might be looking up to, but that is only one hidden message.The scene at the end contains a second one.

Even though it had a 6.8 rating I went with it just because of Joaquin Phoenix. Straight up this movie is slow from start to finish it picks up for about 30 seconds. You don't why anything is going on, you hardly know anything about the protagonist, you don't know anything about the antagonist or ""opposing force"" but quite frankly half way through you'll stop caring if you haven't already turned the movie off. 50% of the screen time is made up of Joaquin Phoenix walking around and the other 50% is him holding a bag over his head. They show maybe two deaths on screen, for the rest they do the old cut away for the kill or just kill people off screen and hear their last shriek before their demise while we stare at an empty room. Honestly I think they didn't have the budget for the extras cus they don't show the faces of the extras except for 2 sort of. And in one of the dumbest scenes I have ever seen in a movie after he finds his mother dead he shoots two guys obviously off camera but then lays next to the survivor holds his hand and sings a song with him, why idk.

537,meganlynntaylor-44607,Definitely interesting and artistic,7,23 January 2019,"I feel like the movie tries hard to be artsy while still vamping up the tension, of which it succeeds. In part I'm to blame for not paying better attention as I watched it because I was a little lost. Towards the end, when he has to save the girl again, I felt like there was something more there. Of course he's still underneath a good person so he doesn't want to just leave her. But also, I think it was an unconscious effort to save himself like he couldn't do when he was little. The girl and him share such violent upbringings, he wanted to make sure she got out unlike himself. But then when she did, he saw that she was fine. She did what he couldn't and moved on. Idk I'm a little confused if he did or didn't kill his father.I found all the flashbacks to be beautifully placed throughout in places to spike the tension but also to spread Pheonix's charcter and see his layers. Pheonix is such a good actor, this is not a role I expected to ever see him in but now that I've seen it, I felt like he was the only person who could have done it. He carries with him such weight and emotion, I wonder if he ever has to try to act at all.And I must note the music and sound choices, using violin strings and pounding to amp up the scene even when nothing seemed to be going on. In horror movies I think they do stuff like that a lot, it worked well here. Music wouldn't have worked the same. And then to play lighter older music from during the diner and kitchen scene, was really well placed. Additionally, the color palettes in various scene really made the mood pop (i.e. the pastel colors and light woods in the diner, the bubblegum pinks with feathers in the bedroom, the girl's dress and bow while she sat at the lace table, etc).So in some ways I enjoyed the movie, playing out cinematically how it might feel inside the head of someone abused, the edginess and saddness.

545,ciorobealaur,Wasn't Even Worth the Energy Needed to Power My TV During the 1.5 Hrs of This Movie,1,3 January 2021,"In terms of narrative, the actual plot and action of the movie is literally all showed in the trailer - this is all you will get, literally all the engaging scenes add up to 3 minutes and are presented there. And the extra that they show in the movie is poorly choreographed, often off camera (does not feel like it's implied to let your imagination run wild, but more like they didn't have the budget to film it) and badly filmed (e.g. CCTV scene).Now, before you judge me for not getting the message of the movie, yes, I understand that this is a character study driven by visual imagery and that the plot is almost secondary.
The guy is clearly disturbed both by his time in the war and one of his cases as an FBI agent (see his cap in one of the flashbacks). Him and the little girl are both shells of people and are linked from the beginning of the movie through their countingWe spend half an hour of this movie with his mom because that shows his humanityScenes like them polishing cutlery mirror those of him whipping his hammer, to show his dual natureWe see him self-harming to show that he is stuck in a loopHe gets pleasure from this as illustrated by the warm light and close-up shots to show that he lives in guiltBy contrast, scenes of violence towards others are shown off camera or through in-world lenses (e.g. CCTV) to depersonalise the actionWe know from his scenes with his dad that he almost became what he hated and that he always had a role of protectorsHe sings and holds hands with the man that killed his mom because at that point, with no one to have to take care of, they were both deadHis suicide by drowning was only prevented by the need to protect othersetc.That being said, it remains a boring movie where nothing happens. You could have cut this all into a 30 minute short film and it would've had more of an emotional impact, and the fact that the main characters lost his way to live is no excuse to make moviegoers lose theirs as well.

553,XanRules,"A Dreary, Stumbling Mess",1,29 April 2018,"Joaquin Phoenix groans, grunts, and whines for ninety minutes, no doubt from the exertion of laboring in vain to save this sorry film with glacial pacing, an incoherent script, thin characters, and a weak plot.Plot and set details are introduced and immediately discarded. Scenes either drag on twice as long as necessary or are cut before they can be resolved or explained. Flashbacks, hallucinations, and symptoms of illness all come and go as the director pleases, either as padding or to artificially build tension.A characteristically excellent score from Jonny Greenwood is constantly drowned out by bizarre sound design choices such as overly loud mouth sounds, random snippets of irrelevant background chatter, and bursts of background music that overpower what precious little important dialogue the movie has.If you want to see a very-close-up Joaquin Phoenix grunt and mumble with his shirt off for an hour and a half while an action movie full of political intrigue happens offscreen, this is the film for you!

The acting is 10/10, the cinematography and camerawork is 10/10, but the plot is horrible and boring. Take blade runner 2049's slow (but awesome) pacing and slow it down, throw in an uninteresting predictable repetitive recycled plot we've seen a billion times which could have been told within 20 minutes, give the main character psychological traumatic issues and show us random crap that's going on in his mind, and you have this movie. It brings nothing new to the table and is done in a way that simply bores you. I love dramas, I know this movie is one, an art drama film, but there Wonder, no suspense, no clever conversations, no anything really.

In a nutshell this film is a drama with your typical basic story line with phenomenal acting that you will forget within a couple of days.

555,georgetdavies,Lynne Ramsey's best film. By a strong margin.,9,11 March 2018,"I feel the term 'speechless' is used a little too often. Only a handful of films have left me speechless. This is one of those films, obviously. Meet Jauquin Phoenix's Joe. Life has thrown everything at Joe. Brutality beyond imagine. He's highly disturbed but within him is a child, a scared child. Working as a hired gun (or hammer), Joe tracks down kidnapped children. He's good at his work although not particularly happy in it. The story follows him as he tracks down the daughter of a senator, Nina, who's been taken to a brothel for underage girls. There's no glamour in the story nor in the execution of its telling.The film is hard to watch at times as it's ultimately a story of abuse. Lynne Ramsey, a master storyteller flexing all her ability here, finds enomournous warmth and catharsis in the midst of the films lost souls. Comparisons have been made to Taxi Driver and these are well earned. Joe is a marauding beast in the concrete jungle, adorned with scars from past beatings, both physical and emotional. The camera echoes this animal instinct, peering round dingy corridors, waiting with sinister placement in dark corners. Unsettlingly the films central feeling. In stark contrast, the scenes with Joe and his ailing mother are filled with warmth, provoking a smile at times and even a laugh or two. These scenes bring both a necessary restbite but are also the anchors to which my emotional involvement depended on. Joe is a lost child, playing silly games with a knife, slurping the last of his milkshake, giggling at himself in the mirror. On a technical level I'm struggling to think of a fault. The sound design is incredible, klaxons, screeches, grates, synths, whispers, both diegetic and non, fill the sound space. And who pops up with a fittingly brilliant original score but Mr Johnny Greenwood, with his best work since There Will Be Blood. Ramsey is one of the best filmmakers working today, this film makes that apparent. I think the making of this kind of film, of this calibre, has been within her powers for a while. Flashes of similar brutality can be seen in her debut feature Ratcatcher. The stakes are not so high but the cruelty is still jarring. It's a lean, tight, scarred muscle of a film. I'm not sure I'll see a better film this year and I don't know whether to be happy or sad about that. It demands a rewatch and this will review will be mostly incoherent but it's some film. It's fantastic. I loved it. I don't really know what to say.",You Were Never Really Here

I could say that Joachim was well directed and delivered some intense yet silent acting... But after all what I can remember is that I lost what, 90 minutes staring at a movie which, cutting all the dead moments of Joachim walking around, sleeping, staring at whatever he was staring to, should have 15 to 20 minutes...
And don't get me wrong, I like slow paced movies, but the story must have much more juice and intensity... It's like in this movie everything was forced, fake, directed with the purpose of impressing...

Just like you don't enjoy this and find it boring, the main character, Joe does as well. Joe does not find any of this enjoyable, and when he has to kill the Senator he needs this. So, when he finds the Senator dead, like us being disappointed, he is severely; Joe breaks down.

His mother is beautifully conveyed and the largely unknown supporting cast are good. The film is well shot. the music is fascinating and the premise of the story is good. However, the flashbacks are somewhat confusing and do not give the viewer a clear picture of his early life or motivation. Perhaps if the storyline had taken a slightly more mainstream path (cf. Taxi Driver), the film would have been a much more enjoyable experience. As it stands, it is good without being exceptional - one I would see once but no more.",You Were Never Really Here

You Were Never Really Here is not really a film to be enjoyed. It is a depressing story that needs you to fill in gaps and to be open for it.

Yes, its not an action movie with Diesel or car chasing etc. This was beautiful, relevant, and pure genius. Just the soundtrack in itself is worth most of the movies out here... 
The scenes, the minimal details telling a thousand words! The importance of the subject- a tragedy going on under our noses and a few people notice (as the final scene, where the waitress, covered in Phoenix's blood says 'Have a good day').
It mesmerized me, made me think and moved me. How many movies nowadays can do that?? Yes, it might have been slower, yet if you let it, it will pull you in and keep you engaged.
Feminine, powerful and detail oriented touch of Lynne Ramsay, met with the raw, fearless nature of Phoenix's character. Bringing alive a subject we need to acknowledge.

Now I will respond to FrostyChud's review, ""Not what it appears,"" and say that Joe does *not* have an incestuous relationship with his mother. Yes, he stays with her when she asks him to, after he puts her to bed. He's a caring son. Also, he doesn't get *in* bed with her -- he sits at the end of the bed. No, his mom does not want him in the bathroom with her (~12:17). When Joe says he's coming in, she says, ""No, no, no!"" At no point does she ask him to come in. No, his mom is not giving him a complicit wink while she's hiding under the bed (~55:40). Firstly, there's no wink. Secondly, she's under the living room coffee table, not a bed. You can see a bit of the table leg, plus the table and rug are the same in the present (visible next to / under the dead guy). Thirdly, the dad is raging because he's an abusive a-hole, not because he discovered something. Mom has blood on her head and hand and is clearly terrified as she hides under the coffee table. Joe has flashbacks to his dad belittling him. In conclusion, there's no maternal incest, implied or otherwise, in this movie, and FrostyChud is completely wrong.",You Were Never Really Here

The comparisons to ""Taxi Driver"" are fair: the performances, the director's vision and exectution, the understated script..... those are some of the similarities. The major differences, for me include the depth to which the protagonist's trauma is not played out for us to view as observers, but drip-fed in increasing doses, often from a first-person perspective, which in my watching felt more like we were experiencing Joe's trauma with him, rather than seeing it played out for us. The film also has a lot of relevance to current discussions of modern masculinity, and here the gendering of social roles is presented very much more as a question than a statement.If you prefer to finish watching a film with your friends and be able to agree pretty much without discussion on what it was about, then I suspect you might find this film pretentious or light on plot.

But it brings you into the mind of Joe - a veteran with many demons, haunted and entirely stoic. At the same time, in all his reticence, Joe (Joaquin Phoenix) does an amazing job in portraying this lost soul. The movie itself is creative enough to bring you into his mind and quite dramatically tells it through his eyes and feelings even though you don't know all that much about his past. It's Taken on a different, more creative and haunting level. There are no real fight scenes even though many people die at Joe's hand.

600,paul738,90 minutes I'll never get back,2,23 January 2020,"I cannot believe someone suggested watching what I can only describe as the strangest, nonsensical waste of 90 minutes I have ever had the misfortune to endure.The best part of the while film was the intro credit animation for Film 4 and Studio Canal. The fact the film was produced by Amazon studios yet is showing on Netflix should have raised suspicion, nevertheless I stuck with it.The first 37 minutes was something out of a weird sexual fetish involving asphyxiation for kicks with images of his childhood self, thrown in for good measure mixed with his contempt yet kindness for his slightly deranged mother.When the action finally started what could have been the films saving grace actually involved black and white CCTV footage showing nothing but a pair of shoes attached to what I could only presume was a dead body lying off camera round the corner.After this 10 / 15 minute disappointment the film returned to the earlier flashbacks of childhood which made no sense. The only scene which may have possibly made me feel empathy towards the main character was when he buried his mother, however instead of this being a scene of laying to rest the woman who gave him life, he decided to wrap her corpse in black bags, drive to the lake and weigh her body down with rocks so she can become fish food.This scene was made even stranger due to him managing to figure out how many stones he needed in his pockets so he could hover underwater at a pre-determined depth.After this, the film could have been redeemed as the protagonist went on a mission of hell bent bloody revenge, instead who I can only presume was the main villain, was seen playing with dolls furniture before being found with his throat slashed.This then cuts to the end scene of him in a diner with the young girl but it wasn't clear if she was really there or not after the image of him blowing his own brains out only to find that wasn't real either.If you like revenge films, this isn't for you",You Were Never Really Here

608,brady1803,An incredible film. Definitely not for everyone.,10,7 May 2018,"I feel it is necessary to understand that this is not a film that is trying to be loved by all. If you are a movie viewer that needs a certain amount of big thrills or set pieces to keep you hooked, this certainly is not a film for you. This movie is very deliberately designed for audiences that want to see a portrait of a character, and don't mind having questions left unanswered (In fact, it helps if you prefer that). It doesn't have a typical pacing structure for a film, and really has a uniquely Lynne Ramsay style.Now, obviously, I loved this film. Every minute of it. It has everything that I want in an action movie (a human lead character, and a lean plot that brings out real emotion from that character), and cuts out everything that I can't stand (Namely, a screenplay that holds your hand every step of the way, and boring action sequences full of fighting).Joaquin Phoenix gives maybe a career-best performance, or at least gives Freddie Quell a run for his money. Lynne Ramsay really moves the picture at a great pace, making the most out of the relatively short runtime, while still letting the movie feel methodical.The thing that really makes this movie incredible is that it has the emotional density and subtlety of a full-blown character study film, but still manages to integrate a plot throughout. The movie doesn't give you a lot of plot information, and lets the audience ponder so many questions. So if this sounds like something that you won't enjoy, don't see the movie. You won't like it. But if you like the sound of something that's closer to a piece of art than a traditional thriller film, give it a shot. It really is quite an experience.",You Were Never Really Here

611,mkcoopers-74-511578,I loved it,10,30 October 2018,"I don't understand why the bad reviews say so little except basically ugh. While the good reviews actually are excellent and go into real details presenting things in ways that I missed in the film. Which means it is excellent.I thought I would not like it because of the child sex theme. But, it was portrayed in a way where the girl gets the revenge needing only to be shown the way. And nothing graphic making you feel that you are contributing to it-or I would have stopped watching. Yeah! Our hero's remourse for Nina's lost innocence pulled me right in. As much for the abuse heaped on her by her father, the governor, those who allowed it to go on long-term (she was his favorite the dying government man says) including her suspiciously suicided mother all combine to form one loss of innocence. That clearly adds to the burdens of our wounded hero Joe. But also when she kills. He did not want her to have to take that burden on.
But. After all she has gone through, I think revenge is her due. And her calmly waiting for Joe to show up shows her understanding that he may be the Only good person she has ever known. And she knows it.Not only does he show her how to kill-look away-and she does not-he expects nothing in return from her, which she clearly was not used to receiving.Both are clearly in shock and bond over their coping mechanisms. I was Very impressed with her acting out trauma by focusing where her brain could handle things-the car windows, lights, her hair, counting. All ways her brain is protecting her from the horrific reality around her that certainly irl many young girls have experienced.The fact that the female director did not dumb down the heroine and put them both in an equal though separate light of strength-just who is rescuing who becomes a theme at the end, adds to the many dimensions my brain will be pulling apart for a while.The subtle acting and directing are what made it rise above. This film did not cater down and make it all easy and simply violent and heavy-handedly deal with these big issues with graphic unthinking brute violence-and I greatly appreciated that.I am neither a film reviewer or a critic. Simply someone who looks for good immersive cinema that makes me think of the world beyond mine and also touches on darker subjects of which I do have some experience.The connection of ptsd to both characters from very different origins sheds light on the bigger picture of ptsd and how early childhood trauma makes most people susceptible to it.

The violence is quick, intermittent and often distorted in one way or another (SPOILER: In one scene we witness an assault on a building through the lens of security camera). By my estimates only about ten or so minutes of the run time are the sort of violence one might expect to receive entering a film about a hired gun who's known for his brutality. Despite this, the tension built by focusing on Joe's psychological struggle - which is explored in a tactile and often confronting manner - left me feeling like I'd just witnessed torture of a most raw and merciless kind. It was funny because when my mate asked me afterward if I 'enjoyed' the film, I just couldn't say that I did, as much I wanted to.

618,knoxsw,"Mind-bending, Beautiful, Heartfelt.",10,22 April 2018,"The first half hour of You Were Never Really Here was confusing, quiet, and brooding with a sense of menace. As time went on, the film explained itself not by telling you, but by re-contextualizing those early sequences. The way the viewer is fed information in this film is amazing. One can learn much about Phoenix's character simply by quick scene transitions. Phoenix's character isn't completely explained, his motives not entirely told, but that's where his menace is derived. Even as the protagonist, his mystery and his unpredictability both made him terrifying to watch. You will be confused in the beginning, but you become content with that confusion and as you come to terms with the events unfolding, every piece of context and framing feels like a gift.
 You Were Never Really here's greatest strength, alongside Phoenix's performance, is its stellar execution and cinematography. Lynne Ramsay and Thomas Towsend (the cinematographer) make a point not to show the violence most of the time. Instead, you're left to imagine the aftermath, while seeing the attack, making it that much more thrilling and painful. Many of the transitions, pans, and uses of camera movement are rare, unusual, and beautiful. The way the camera works is its own thrill ride, and it definitely deserves a repeat viewing for that element alone.The heart. This film has a huge beating heart. There's soul exuding through this movie, into Phoenix's character. His shallow motivations and inconsistent morals make him seem real, and the reality in this movie, for me, is incredibly disarming. It almost enters the uncanny valley for me, as there's a concerted effort to tie the subject to reality, rather than remove it.The film has been paralleled with Taxi Driver, and to an extent, this is true, but it really only shows in the third act. Thematically it's similar, and the protagonists are similarly moral in one aspect and amoral in another. A better parallel, stylistically, would be last year's Good Time. However this film is much more affecting and powerful, with a focus on themes of love over Good Time's experimentation with morality. The soundtrack by the marvelous Jonny Greenwood, the power and menace of Joaquin Phoenix, and finally the beautiful direction, writing, and filmmaking all make ""You Were Never Really Here"" a profound, memorable piece of art.",You Were Never Really Here

Before everyone gets all uptight about that statement let me summarize.For me this is one of those ""Emperor New Clothes"" films. A few art students turned critics views it as a masterpiece. Making anyone that feels differently as if they missed something, or aren't ""smart/savvy enough to understand ""great"" cinema. so everyone marches in lockstep saying how powerful, intense and beautiful this film is.The acting is very good, (Joaquin is very, very good), and the settings are sufficient to the plot. The cinematography is very good as well. The problem lies with the pacing. I read a review about ""no fat"", ""intense throughout""...sorry...if it were any slower a Baseball game would break out. All kidding aside, at the 45 minute mark it finally seems as though the film is going to switch gears, and it does for ...a small bit before going back to the plodding nature of the first part of the film.There are much better examples of films taking time to slowly discover the character, creating a tense environment, and enjoyable show, Blue Ruin comes to mind.

635,dwrevans,"Leon: The Professional, but made very very real",9,16 June 2020,"The Parallels to Luc Besson's León run as deep as the premise for the story- a lone hitman going on the hunt to save a young, recently fatherless, girl embroiled in in deep government corrupt coverups. Yet where Reno and Portman's relationship is playful, endearing and ultimately heartbreaking; Phoenix and Samsonov's attachment is necessary, moulded by trauma and for me crushing.Flashbacks and visions play a major role in the film but are deftly managed whereby the aforementioned link between the central characters is subtly introduced at an early stage. Our obsessively off the radar hitman is more than the cliche stereotype for his character, having a sometimes strained yet loving relationship with his mother, possibly rooted in their own troubled pasts - he is pretty human for someone whose seen a lot.Glitches in reality and visions from the past nod to these links yet don't bash you over the head with them. A mix of post-military service PDST and a drug dependency keeps reality just loose enough to masterfully weave these flashbacks and jarring images into the narrative without giving the rules of the game away.Joaquin's character in particular is the most truthful realisation of this kind of hitman I could imagine and as usual the subtleties of his performance carry real depth, especially in moments like the apparently improvised duet. Touching on that moment, the soundtrack really must be commended. For me the use of old americana classics during some scenes highlighted the madness, not just of the government corruption but of the personal experiences of Joe and Nina. Additionally Johnny Greenwood's soundtrack was a perfect match in tone and tension.Phenomenal ending, really just bringing your own sympathy for Joe and Nina, for both their past and present situations, to the fore; coupled with a quiet optimism that a film this dark should probably have. 'If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake' and if I knew that was coming, well it just wouldn't be the same - avoid any spoilers and just take the dip.Hats off to Lynne Ramsay.",You Were Never Really Here

641,ndenquelectric,Incredulous Filmmaking,10,7 April 2018,"This film is a metaphorical journey. For those of you that just saw an angry man seeking vengeance for a missing girl let me enlighten you.This film digs deep using visual metaphors. It's not just a movie about a man, his mother, and the girl he saves but is actually about a down-in-the-gutter dog becoming the good boy we all know he is. Joaquin Phoenix plays the physical manifestation of a dog, bearded and scruffy he seems to be on an everlasting journey to be redeemed, petted, and taken for a walk. It is a story about finding your owner.The story starts out with Joaquin digging in the dirt, ruining the flower beds. There are a lot of flashbacks to when he was a young puppy, having to deal with the torment of his owners, and abusive father, a reluctant mother.Joaquin needs the comfort of all domesticated animals but has trouble achieving it. He suffers from a Pomeranian complex that has him working against his natural hound instincts to sniff out the truth and drag those in danger to safety while, like a wolf, digging deep into the throats of those that seem malevolent.The hammer represents a choke chain collar, used to hold him back, create a shield for him in these stressful situations, perhaps a trick used by his owners.The film is beautifully shot and edited even more wonderfully because, as with a dog's natural instinct to attack, we cannot hold Joaquin responsible for his actions which is why we never see the violence head-on, just as an aftermath ""it was my instinct i'm sorry I pissed on the carpet and dug holes in the new couch.""Finally Joaquin comes face to face with his owner (in the film portrayed by his mother) who dies and it is up to him to bury her in the lake, as would a dog bury a bone, to be fondly remembered and visited later. And just as a dog shakes himself off after emerging from the water Joaquin has that dense curly beard which holds no moisture.Finally he realizes that he is not defined by who takes care of him (anyone can look after a stray animal) and he emerges from within those puppy dog eyes to become protector of his new owner, represented by a young girl in the midst of unthinkable trouble yet it is her who finally gives Joaquin the recognition that he deserves.He is, in fact, a good boy.Okay movie, excellent film.",You Were Never Really Here

Joe takes his mother to a lake to bury her in the water and maybe to kill himself. He doesn't and again tracks the girl down. When he finds her, she has killed her kidnapper/pedophile/rapist herself. He takes her away.

643,tmaly-55351,Ignore the bad reviews,7,28 May 2018,"I feel like I have to write a review just because there are so many off-the-wall bad reviews. I have no idea where they are coming from. Anyone who calls this film boring is a movie snob and clearly has nothing better to do with their lives. It's not trying to be some Liam Neeson action flick or a Marvel superhero movie. It's slower paced than any of that - to give us the opportunity to really empathize with the main character's psychological/emotional struggle. Personally, I don't fuss so much about cinematography, story, style, etc..... what I want in this case is a movie that makes me feel what the characters feel and leaves an impression on me in the end. He's dealt with some serious trauma and has become a vigilante to help save kidnapped girls (I dunno about anyone else, but sexual trafficking of underage girls is more disturbing than 'boring' in my mind). At the same time, he a tortured soul, and we get to see just enough flashbacks to moments in his traumatic past, done in such a brief flash similar to how he might be reminded and then try to suddenly repress it. There is deliberately not much dialogue so we can get the opportunity to actually empathize with him. Less talking/thinking, more feeling. Anyone who says that nothing happens in the movie must have seen a different movie. The plot is pretty simple - starting out with an introduction to his work and his relationship with his mother, and then taking on an assignment to find a senator's teenage daughter. He finds and saves her, and then some men come and kill everyone he knows, including his mother, and kidnap the girl back. He contemplates and attempts suicide several times (a chronic issue in his life), but being reminded of these helpless teenage girls gets him to change his mind. There's a level of delusion where you don't know what's actually happening and what he's imagining in his mind. It's creative, I wouldn't call it ""confusing"" like other reviewers - it's all the flashy action films that have dumbed people down I suppose. I'm baffled also to read people bickering about whether the movie is violent or not. There is a lot of violence, maybe not in terms of on-camera gore - but there is a lot of blood. It's still pretty gruesome and it's de-emphasized enough so it blends pretty well with the psychological turmoil of the main character.There were a few reviews that seemed to psychoanalyze the film either as some sort of ""Mulholland Drive"" type delusion or suggesting some sort of Freudian complex with his mother where him saving the girls is really him saving himself.... But honestly I didn't notice any of these layers of perception. Other than his momentary flashbacks, moments of vengeance or contemplations/fantasies of suicide, I saw it pretty much to be taken literally. I saw his mother as psychologically damaged herself, but more so as the victim of trauma than perpetrator. There was at least one brief flashback (not lasting more than 10 seconds) where it was clear that her younger self was being assaulted by her husband and the main character as a child was hiding to stay safe. But I saw no psychological manipulation (despite the Psycho references) between the elder mother and the elder son. Overall, the movie is very unsettling, if that's the kind of thing you're after in a very intense drama type of movie. I don't see it fitting in with other action, drama or thriller movies and I think that's a good thing.",You Were Never Really Here

Unfortunately, it feels unfinished because it's so disjointed hopping from past to present and everywhere in between.
Mind you, this isn't the time hop styling of a Tarantino piece, no, this feels raw. Like someone took the rough draft version of their screenplay edited it twice and called it done.
In short, it needs finessing.
The actors are all believable, the dialogue is passable but it could use more substance for dialogue, the foley good, lighting great, art and makeup direction passable, musical score is fine as well.
It's the overall flow that really needs help.

There is no history (if there was any in the book they simply chose to show almost none of it), no plot, no dialogue, there aren't even any real characters. The only good thing in this movie is Joaquin Phoenix's acting. But even his character fails to get somewhere, as the flashbacks that he keeps having seem like they are getting there but they don't or that they are telling a history but in the end they are not.

In the first part of this film I found myself questioning the films moral compass, starting to wonder about flashbacks that I felt were too confused, too forced, I didn't really appreciate what I was being subliminally primed to reflect on. Then Boom......it starts to form, the pieces begin to fit and the picture that plays out is one of depth, drama and a stark take on what I consider is a sobering message about what really goes on in our world. An understanding of every shot and scene that seemed to be extraneous in the first half floods the movie - every character, every situation, every interaction comes together to give this movie an ending that is both satisfying and leaves you with a flood of possibilities. Not one performance lets this movie down and that goes for both on screen and off, the entire ensemble comes together in a movie that juxtaposes everyday commonalities we can all relate to with scarily realistic tangents mingled together to form the snow-globe of society we stumble along in.

I wish I had never bothered wasting my time or money on a ticket to see this film as I will never get those minutes of my life back.The back story to the protagonist (Pheonix) was very weak and not all of the flash backs to his past were relevant or made any sense as to why the character was that way or as to what he was doing. The story line for the movie is pretty much non existence. It is near impossible to understand why 2 key actions were done by the characters candidate and his daughter and the flow of the movie is missing large chunks of story line and there isn't even the ability to make a leap of faith in trying to connect the story for something to click later in the movie - it makes no sense, if someone can explain all the things then I am open to listening.On a side note to the director - I attended this at London Film Festival and if you are too shy to talk to the BFI staff on stage to introduce the film and fail to return to a promised Q&A then don't bother showing up and walking off before answering any questions.",You Were Never Really Here

Mr. Phoenix makes a wonderful job and outstanding performance from his part - I have to admit I have only seen him in the Gldaiator, I think - and he stole scenes but there too - but here he really OWNS it. Marvolleously <3
But what caught me the most was the feeling of being an abused child and the anxiety it delivers through ur life, and Joaquin he nailed it - of course cudos to the director and scriptwriter too, but I think without Joaquin Phoenix it wold have been a lesser film.
I think Mr. Phoenix in in almost every scene with actors - so to say the leat he carries it totally.
For me this an Acadamy Award performanes and I will indeed contnue to watch Mr. Phoenix future and his past accomplishments.
The sound and the editing was also to my liking - and I think it must be both a fright and a joy for a director to work with a proffesional and so intense actor as Mr. Phoenix must be.

745,brayanflores-24287,You Were Never Really Here - But You Were a Masterpiece,9,8 August 2018,"If I were to describe this movie in as little words as possible, I would say this is a bleak, brutal, slowburning masterpiece. What Lynne Ramsey has crafted is a character study unlike any other.
Our protagonist is named Joe, he's a war vet who's constantly fighting with his own personal demons which we see through small flashbacks throughout the film, these never really get explained nor do they show very much, but what we do see is enough to tell us why he's the way he is. He's a hired gun who hunts down missing girls and their captors to save them and punish those who have done the unspeakable deed. He takes a job that's no different than any other, but so quick does it become something he's never dealt with. 
The movie plops you down into Joes world almost immediately, showing us the care he takes in his craft. Also showing us that he is a very disturbed man in the same intro. The movie is almost like a day in the life as it has a very loose plot line that is fairly simple once you understand, and only takes place through a couple of days, but it doesn't take away from it at all. 
The star of the show is Joaquin Phoenix, as he's the only character that says more than 10 lines, his performance is one of the best of the decade so far as he portrays this broken man unlike anybody else could. The cinematography is beautiful yet bleak in its portrayal of the dark underbelly of New York, even in the scenes where it seems more safe. Ramsey's direction was amazing, this being her first time dealing with such violence, she nailed it. And what sends it all home is the perfect score which is worth listening to even if you have yet to see the movie.
Overall in my personal opinion, it's the best movie to be released in 2018. What Lynne Ramsey has made is a dark, thrilling experience which is unlike anything I've seen put to screen.",You Were Never Really Here
746,andrewrmontoya,A commentary about Violence,9,27 September 2018,"I love this movie. I see people mentioning a lot of psycho sexual themes. Honestly it either went way over my head, or it's not there. I'm inclined to believe the latter. I think the true and most relevant theme of this movie is about violence.Yes i can see how this movie can appear to be boring to people, but boring doesn't mean bad in my book. *spoilers kind of maybe*The lead is a massively tortured soul with a massive amount of darkness in him. given the few snippets of his background we know that he was abused by his father, maybe possibly his mother(maybe). And is also haunted by the horrors of war. despite the darkness within him he seems to want to use that darkness to do some good in the world, first with joining the military, and second with his new job of tracking down kidnapped girls. The scene when he is going through the Brothel, it is filmed in a style of a horror movie. It was fantastic, unsettling and appropriate. As violent as the lead can be, the distinction that is made be tween him and the antagonists is that Joe is never more violent than he has to be, and he's not filled with hate, anger most likely, but not hate. One of my favorite scenes ever is the scene where he lays on the floor next to the guy who possibly killed his mother after mortally wounding him. I was sure that he was going to kill him in a horrific way, but the scene took a harsh right turn when a song comes on the radio and they both sing it together as the guy dies. That scene brought about a self reflection on me that a movie hasn't done in a while. I would have killed the guy in a horrific way, and i haven't even been abused, nor am i angry the way joe is angry. I would have wanted to be more violent than would have been necessary. We all like to think of ourselves as the good guy, but in that moment it mate me realize the darker parts of me in a way that no other movie has. The way that Joe still sees this guy as a person and doesn't dehumanize him was breathtaking. I think that it's something that is incredibly relevant in this day and age, when we tend to want to dehumanize people just for having a difference of opinion. I think the movie has a powerful statement on violence, that it is sometimes necessary, but cruelty is never necessary.",You Were Never Really Here

Ramsay made great thriller with great character played by the master Joaquin Phoenix. His character is full of difrent emotions. We are studying Joe's life during the movie.Movie starts slowly, Joe is in work, meaning dirty job like beating up some people or saving people from the bud guys hands. We are following his steps and watching how the life of veteran with painfull past is going. Is there any chance for Joe to make his life better? Maybe.Movie is full of violence but it's not only about it, for me the movie is about carrying on the life we don't like, but if we don't want to do anything for our selves, we always can do it for the other people, Joe picks option number two, save the little girl.After movie when I went out of the cinema I was wondering about this movie for a long time.

759,themohamed-14671,"""Scary, alive, violent, sexual.""",9,24 January 2021,"Written and directed by Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay and based on a novella of the same name by Jonathan Ames, You Were Never Really Here revolves around Joe, an ex-soldier and former FBI agent suffering from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) who is now a hammer-wielding hired gun who tracks down and rescues missing girls.While on the surface it may seem like a hybrid between Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive, it's actually both much more and much less. What You Were Never Really Here does that the other two movies didn't, is that it explored what's going on inside the protagonist's head, and it did this so vividly. This is not a movie about what this man does, it's about what he feels and thinks while doing what he does. And for that reason, You Were Never Really Here doesn't bother with action sequences. Unlike Drive's stylish approach to them, You Were Never Really Here either skips those sequences or shows them as if they're not important. This resulted in more focus on the headspace of Joe as well as some unique action sequences.It becomes obvious almost halfway into the movie that You Were Never Really Here is a character study of Joe, a man having a mid-life crisis and suffering from PTSD. This is made clear through showing how Joe interacts with people and with himself while constantly being haunted by disturbing memories of a troubled childhood and burdensome work experiences. Joe is violent and brutal, but broken. If Taxi Driver's Travis Bickle was the disturbed loner who wanted to stand up against the scum and Drive's Driver was the cold-blooded stuntman who risked his life to protect the woman he loved, then You Were Never Really Here's Joe is the traumatized hired gun trying to be useful to the world while battling his inner demons.Ramsay said that she wanted Joaquin Phoenix for the role all along because she believed that ""he could give a vulnerability to this character, and it wouldn't be that six pack guy who is invincible"". And she was absolutely right. Phoenix gives a breathtaking performance. I don't think I've ever seen someone deliver a performance as a broken man as genuinely as Phoenix in You Were Never Really Here. And the way he balanced the character between brutality and softness is amazing. It's a beautiful haunting performance that will stick with you long after the credits roll, which is what Lynne Ramsay aims to do with her movies. In an interview with Tomris Laffly from Roger Ebert, Ramsay said ""I love going to the cinema. I go in, sit in a film. When I walk out of the cinema, I feel like I'm still in the film."" In You Were Never Really Here, you will go in, sit in the film, walk out of the cinema and still be in Joe's head due to Phoenix's memorable performance and Ramsay's immersive visual storytelling techniques.What's so unique about the movie is that it shows what it doesn't need to tell. Joe's character is presented mostly through his PTSD. We learn about his past through the flashbacks he gets. We learn about what he's feeling through his self-destructive behavior and the severe anxiety he suffers from. We see his brutality through shots of what he had done on a mission or how he's preparing for the next one. We see his gentle side through his interactions with his mother (Judith Anna Roberts) and the center of his latest rescue mission, Nina (Ekaterina Samsonov), and these interactions aren't always verbal, sometimes they're just looks or physical contact. And not only Joe's character, but even major plot points are presented solely through visuals, and that's where my only issue with the movie is. Sometimes it gets too vague for its own good. It's nothing big, but it might cause some confusion.Another factor that contributes to making the movie as immersive as it is, is Jonny Greenwood's score and Ramsay's use of it. Ramsay stated that she thinks about sound and music when she's early on in the process because of what they do the viewer's subconscious. The music ranges from brutal and intense to melancholic and sweet, just like our protagonist's mind.You Were Never Really Here is an experience. Ramsay said that she wished the synopsis for the movie only said ""Enjoy the trip."" And I agree, because the movie is a trip into the unstable mind of a man falling apart. It doesn't guide you or manipulate you, it simply shows you and lets you feel and think.The best description of the movie was by Samantha Morton (who played the titular character in Ramsay's Morvern Callar) who described it as the movie equivalent of a Francis Bacon painting. Ramsay embraced this comparison and said that like Bacon's paintings, the movie is ""Scary, alive, violent, sexual.""",You Were Never Really Here

762,febinboogeyman,A pulpy noir thriller which hits you in the head real hard,10,9 April 2019,"In her fourth feature film, ""You were never really here"" Lynne Ramsay touches on a topic few other female contemporaries have done, making a pulpy noir exploring the psyche of a broken man.
The movie received a 10-minute standing ovation at Cannes and the accolade for the best actor as the nuanced details of this humble indie film is taken forward by the sheer force that is Joaquin Phoenix (Joe), with inordinate help from Ekaterina (Nina).
References to ""Psycho"" and ""Taxi driver"" are made throughout, with the movie being based on ""Jonathan Ames"" . It revolves around ex-militant Joe who reveals the cruel world and unspoken emotions of a traumatized man, battling PTSD and on the verge of insanity. He meets Nina in rather unfortunate circumstances in his arduous and troubled journey and therein shows the soft side of an otherwise callous and ruthless man. Characters in the film share anguish and victim-hood and moments of Joe's thinking are sometimes absent from the film since we are inside his head.
It's the kind of movie that moves with you, a visual narration that may look like that of a hitman movie but instead rends the idea and provides a sui generis outlook of it. No shot or cut here is idle or extraneous and it shies away from the lurid ways of action sequences.
The brilliance of auteur filmmaker Lynne Ramsay takes up a physical manifestation through the movie as it provides a visceral and visual effect with its perfect scene transitions, angled shots off mirrors and innuendos.
Joaquin Phoenix, with the reputation of being a chameleon in his roles (""Her"", ""Joker"") brings up his method acting abilities into Joe, improvising most of the scenes in the presence of a deliberately incoherent script.
He, at a point of the movie, sits with a dying victim, gently singing along to Charlene's ""I've Never Been to Me.""
Townend's calm, crisp camerawork and Bini's editing are commendable and praise to Jonny Greenwood (Phantom Thread, There Will Be Blood) for a thrilling score that blends its beats with the chaotic noise of the streets - a pulsating tempo that drives the plot forward.
The movie is a study in damage and barely lasts 90 minutes, but trust you me, there's so much going on in each second that in the end you'll never know what hit you.",You Were Never Really Here

And as the movie advances forward, the craziness of Joe's mind gets worse, and all the hallucinations, voices and flashbacks becomes more frequent; and in the end the line between what is real and what's only in Joe's disturbed mind gets so blurred that you don't have any clue of what to believe...In conclusion this movie is one of the best made films of this decade...

771,seamus-11964,I created an imdb account just to review this,1,17 June 2018,"I love arthouse films. I don't require lots of 'things to happen' to enjoy a film. I have a Master's Degree in English Literature and a PhD in Sociology and have been stunned by the critical reception of this film. Where to begin? The film was a mess - it seemed the film-maker had no idea what kind of film they were trying to make. Mainstream films usually follow a genre since, by signalling that genre through certain cues, the audience is primed to 'read' it in a certain way, making it quick and easy to produce meaning (of a limited type). Brilliant films often knowingly manipulate different genre expectations to not only produce more novel meaning but to draw attention to this very process, creating a postmodern ethics based on critiquing old mythologies and the naive acceptance of narrative authority. Directly conversely, bad films that try hard but are a mess often find themselves manipulated by different genre expectations, producing different meanings seemingly without the film-maker's understanding. This film fits that category. The film initially signals it will have something to say in a realist tradition about the psychology of trauma. Fairly early in the film I grew wary, since as soon as you have a bad-arse single-handedly taking out teams of guards the film is signalling that it doesn't really belong in a realist mode, but is something generically closest to a teenage action flick with its lead a requisite card-board cutout of masculine potency. I found myself asking - why am I watching at a film festival a movie that's as meaningless as any action flick (but without any of the fun)? The film had nothing to say about trauma, men, masculinity, women, politics or society. The characters were fantasy representations of certain stereotypes - the bad father, the good mother, the good son, the damaged soldier. No doubt in reality there are all too many abusive fathers and the worst abuses, such as running pedophile rings, certainly emerge from power that is political, economic and masculinised, but the film reduces such issues to fantasy caricature, as when the dirty work of the pedophile politician is carried out by his official security detail, replete with US flag pins, which is - even for the happily conspiracy-minded - just silly. More problematically, not only are the causes of such abuses (here, the Bad Father writ both personal and political) simplified, but the consequences glossed over. Victims of pedophile rings become empowered bad-arses able to slit throat and throw out one-liners. Male victims of male abuses become damaged or broken, but still, in the most old-fashioned, conservative ideal, must be bad-arse killing machines, tempered by a sense of justice and compassion, but never actually show fear and never lose potency and empowerment. This mythology is conservative and deeply problematic, especially in a film that at times signals that it is a realist psychological portrait, not a winking, self-knowing homage to multiple mythologies, a la Tarantino. As the film ends it seems to have no idea what it is trying to do. A desperate male-female duo sit at a diner booth, as the audience wait for all hell to break loose. Sound familiar? Yes, it's a rip-off, not an homage, since it adds nothing to the film, except trying to all of a sudden signal that bad-arse attitudes are a key part of the film. I have problems with political-ethical aspects of Tarantino's films, but they are brilliantly executed and brilliantly manipulate genre and audience expectations. Tarantino knows exactly what he's trying to do, and has no interest in the political-ethical issues that I do, which is fair enough. This film, though, channels one of Tarantino's worst traits - the tendency to titillate the audience by showing monstrous characters being tortured or mutilated - but instead of taking on Tarantino's cultivated disinterest in politics and ethics, this film signals its interest in such issues and then devalues them by moving further and further towards unrealistic and aestheticised violence and bad-arse attitudes, which here seem lame and forced, neither realistic nor stylised and fun. What has prompted me to write this is not how bad the film is, but the critical reception, as I despair if this is what we take a 'good film' to be in the 21st century.",You Were Never Really Here
