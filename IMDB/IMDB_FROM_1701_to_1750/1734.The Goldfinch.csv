0,SnoopyStyle,flawed,5,31 October 2020,"A terrorist bombing explodes at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. 13-year-old Theo Decker's mother is killed and in the confusion, he steals a small painting. It's an important painting from a lesser known artist and everyone assumes that it has been destroyed in the explosion. Theo is sent to live with family friend Mrs. Barbour (Nicole Kidman) and her family until his problematic father Larry (Luke Wilson) and girlfriend Xandra (Sarah Paulson) show up. They take him to a desolate suburban community where Theo befriends troubled teen Boris (Finn Wolfhard). He runaway back to NYC to antique dealer Hobie (Jeffrey Wright) and his young charge Pippa who survived the bombing. As a young man, Theo (Ansel Elgort) starts working for Hobie.This is adapted from a book which won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize. It's apparent quite early on that it's book. This is beautifully shot by Roger Deakins but it's told by a high school C-student struggling to write a book report. There are things right off the bat that is murky for no good reason. It rushes. There is a lot to stuff into the movie and it intends to stuff it all in there whether it fits or not. At a certain point, I come to the conclusion that the structure is wrong and the material may not fit a movie which is already too long at over two hours. Despite all the talent involved in this project, this is fundamentally flawed.",The Goldfinch
1,Hitchcoc,Disappointing,6,24 June 2020,"I have a hard fast rule. Never compare a movie to the book on which it is based. This, of course, is impossible in many ways. But one needs to accept the limitations of the silver screen. Little introspection, detail, character development, and so on. Obviously, with good direction and acting, we have a new telling of a tale. I really enjoyed the book here, but was astounded that a movie was being made of it. The dull portrayal of the cerebral nature of the plot doesn't stand up well. It kept my interest only in a how-are-they-going-to-show that kind of way. There is something so drab here. We are asked to glean all kinds of information from close-ups of the protagonist and Nicole Kidman. Connections fail. Suspense is non-existence and contrived. Some books just weren't meant to be movies.",The Goldfinch
2,nogodnomasters,He gave me the ring.,4,9 December 2019,"Theo Decker (Ansel Elgort /Oakes Fegley ) grabs the Goldfinch painting when a museum blows up, one where his mother dies. He is subsequently raised by Nicole Kidman, his father Luke Wilson and Jeffrey Wright, an antique dealer. The incident defines his life and the finite amount of boring flashbacks. Oh, and the red-haired girl.The film was a boring drama done in an artsy style to avoid bad reviews like the Emperor's New Clothes.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Goldfinch
3,kosmasp,Paint me a picture,7,18 August 2021,"I might have intended that pun - though I did not plan to do so - as in it came to me a few seconds before I wrote it down. Now being able to react and do certain things quickly ... not always are these decisions we make and actions we take in our best interest ... certainly not in other peoples best interests ... something you will encounter here. And just a side note in case you don't like the pun in the summary line.The acting is quite solid and first things first: I am not very versatile when it comes to paintings and art of that kind. So while I do appreciate something pretty (viewed through my eyes and my sensibilities), I could not tell you about techniques and other things that people may detect in paintings. Luckily enough, while the title is sort of a hint, this is more of a drama about growing up and making decisions .. ""good"" and ""bad"" ones.Story is ok, with the time lines and all that. Was not as engaging for me as I did hope for. Still more than a decent movie overall.",The Goldfinch
4,classicsoncall,"""I lost something that should have been immortal.""",7,28 October 2020,"I was not aware this movie was based on a novel. The story opens with the main character contemplating suicide over the events in his life that began with a fatal bombing that took place in a museum which took the life of his mother. There are some parallels in the story that coincide with the after effects of the tragedy for a girl named Pippa who was also present with a mentor, who made eye contact with young Theo, but who's recollection was dimmed because of her injuries. Both Theo and Pippa suffer guilt over the death of their companion that day, Theo because he and his mother were visiting the museum only because they were early for another appointment; Pippa because she asked her mentor to accompany her for an audition taking place elsewhere. The title of the movie comes into play relating to the name of a painting by Carel Fabritius, signed and dated in 1654. In it's own way, the story of the bomb blast in the film mimics a gunpowder explosion that killed the painter Fabritius, while the painting survived all the way to the present day.What I just learned after the fact is that upon close inspection, the goldfinch in the painting is chained to the mantel that it's perched on. This was not visible in the movie, nor was it alluded to by any of the characters. Perhaps the novel mentioned it, but doing so in the film would have gone a long way to explain how both the young and adult Theo found himself trapped or 'chained' by circumstances that affected the decisions that came to circumscribe his life. Taken in by an adoptive family for a time, he's eventually reunited with a father who's principal interest in his son was how he could benefit financially from the arrangement. As the story progresses with it's chronologically challenging time line, characters move in and out of the picture in a manner that makes for some confusion.What was somewhat difficult to understand for this viewer was the concept of the painting being used as collateral by diverse parties in the art world for significant financial transactions. That just didn't make sense to me, even if a summary explanation was offered by the character Boris in the story. The real painting now resides in a collection at The Hague in the Netherlands. I would like the viewing of the picture to have been a more entertaining and worthwhile experience, but the affect it left me with was somewhat ambiguous. I imagine, as other reviewers have noted, that the idea of compressing an eight hundred page novel into a movie, even if it sits at two and a half hours, was a bigger challenge than the film makers expected.",The Goldfinch
5,CinemaSerf,"It does require a bit of concentration, but is worth it in the end.",8,16 November 2019,"I really don't see why this got quite such a kicking from the critics. Ansel Elgort, Jeffrey Wright and Nicole Kidman put a good effort into a tale that hinges on the impact of one single, tragic, moment in time and of the subsequent consequences. The characters visibly evolve throughout the film and it flows in an interesting and absorbing fashion. It is a wee bit too long and perhaps some more judicious pruning of the original - rather lengthy - book might have been in order. That said, the screenplay does hold true to the book in all the essentials and really this is well worth a watch.",The Goldfinch

7,ferguson-6,circumstances such that,6,13 September 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge after watching this movie is deciding whether it needed more time or less. With a run time of two-and-a-half hours, that may seem like a ludicrous question, but Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize (fiction) winning 2013 novel was almost 800 pages long, covering many characters and spanning more than a decade. What to include and what to omit surely generated many discussions between director John Crowley (the excellent BROOKLYN, 2015) and screenwriter Peter Straughan (Oscar nominated for the fantastic TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY, 2011).13 year old Theo (Oakes Fegley) is visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art with his mother when a bomb explodes leaving Theo dazed in the rubble and his mother dead. An encounter with an injured stranger causes Theo to take a painting and flee the museum. Theo proceeds to hide the artwork as the family of one of his schoolmates takes him in. The painting is ""The Goldfinch"" by Rembrandt's pupil Carel Fabritius. In the first of many parallels separated by time, we learn Fabritius was killed (and most of his work destroyed) in an explosion. In fact, it's these parallels and near-mirror-images are what make the story so unique and interesting ... and so difficult to fit into a film.When Theo's long-lost drunken shyster father (Luke Wilson) shows up with his equally smarmy girlfriend Xandra (Sarah Paulson), they head to the recession-riddled suburbs of Las Vegas. It's here where Theo meets Boris (Finn Wolfhard, Richie from the two IT movies), a Ukranian emigrant living with his dad (yet another parallel). The two boys become friends, partaking in drugs, alcohol, and shoplifting. Another tragedy puts Theo on the run. He finds himself back in New York, where he takes up with Hobie (Jeffrey Wright), the partner of the stranger from the museum.All of this is told from the perspective of young adult Theodore Decker, played by Ansel Elgort. We see him bunkered in a hotel room contemplating suicide. The story we watch shows how his life unfolded and landed him in this particular situation. And it's here where we find the core of the story. Circumstances in life guide our actions, and in doing so, reveal our true character. Theo carries incredible guilt over his mother, and his actions with Hobie, regardless of the reasons for doing so, lead him to a life that is not so dissimilar to that of adult Boris (Aneurin Barnard, DUNKIRK) when their paths cross again.Other supporting work is provided by Ashleigh Cummings as Pippa, the object of Theo's desire, Willa Fitzgerald (played young Claire in ""House of Cards"") as Kitsey Barbour, Theo's fiancé, as well as Denis O'Hare, Peter Jacobson, and Luke Kleintank. As a special treat, Oscar winner Nicole Kidman plays Mrs. Barbour in what feels like two different performances. When Theo is young, she is the cold, standoffish surrogate mother who takes him in; however when older Theo returns, her own personal tragedies have turned her into a warm bundle of emotions in need of pleasantry. It's sterling work from an accomplished actress.The segments of the film that resonate deepest are those featuring Oakes Fegley as young Theo. Fegley was so good in the criminally underseen WONDERSTRUCK (2017), and here he conveys so much emotion despite maintaining a stoic demeanor. It's rare to see such a layered performance from a young actor. Of course the film is helped immensely by the unequaled work of cinematographer Roger Deakins. Mr. Deakins finally won his first Oscar last year in his 14th nomination. Trevor Gureckis provides the music to fit the various moods and the two time periods. All of these elements work to give the film the look of an Oscar contending project; however, we never seem to connect with the older Theo, which leaves a hollow feeling to a story that should be anything but. Instead we are left to play ""spot the parallels"" ... a fun game ... but not engaging like we would hope.",The Goldfinch
8,phd_travel,Surpisingly interesting and unpredictable story,8,19 September 2019,With some concentration this is a touching and different movie that kept me quite interested throughout it's length. A young boy loses his mother in a Met Museum bomb (what a horrid idea to put in people's minds). Nicole Kidman plays a kind mother of a friend who looks after him for a while. He has a drunkard father played by Luke Wilson who comes back for him and takes him to Las Vegas. The horror. From a cultured gentile upbringing with art and music he goes straight into White Trash Land with a versatile Sarah Paulson as a Vegas step mom from if not hell then Vegas. In Vegas he meets a Ukranian boy who gets him hooked on drugs. At the center of this complicated story is a rare Dutch master painting he salvages and hides and a nice furniture restorer who looks after him.The young actor does all the heavy lifting. Very moving performance. Ansel looks suitably outwardly unscarred as an adult. Doesn't have to act too much. He's not the most emotive actor but it's okay for this role. Nicole does an odd UES lady. I don't know the book so don't know the reason for her Stepford nature.This is an interesting story with children facing the most horrid adults and some nice ones. Unexpectedly engrossing.,The Goldfinch
9,gradyharp,Life as Art,10,1 January 2020,"Donna Tartt's enormously successful novel THE GOLDFINCH has been successfully transformed for the screen by Peter Straughan and as directed by John Crowley (Brooklyn, Boy A, Closed Circuit) it becomes an engrossing, very long, richly detailed composite of art, classical music, antiques, and life - as travelled by a young lad into adulthood.The time frame is from childhood to adulthood and the extremes of roles as played by the actors is noted here (child actor to adult actor). Theodore ""Theo"" Decker (Ansel Elgort) was 13 years old when his divorced mother (Hailey Wist) was killed in a bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. During the bombing Theo is cautioned by Welty (Robert Joy) to save his daughter Pippa (Aimee Laurence > Ashleigh Cummings) and an old painting, and Welty's partner in life and antiques - Hobie (Jeffrey Wright) - cares for Pippa after the bombing. The tragedy changes the course of his life, sending him on a stirring odyssey of grief and guilt, reinvention and redemption, and even love. Through it all, he holds on to one tangible piece of hope from that terrible day...a painting of a tiny bird chained to its perch. The Goldfinch. Theo is taken in by the wealthy Barbour family (Boyd Gains, Nicole Kidman, Carly Connors > Willa Fitzgerald, Jack DiFalco > Luke Kleintank, Collin Shea Schirrmacher > Austin Weyant) until displaced by his alcoholic father (Luke Fisher) and girlfriend (Sarah Paulson) and moved to Las Vegas where Theo is befriended by Boris (Canadian actor Finn Wolfhard > Welsh actor Aneurin Barnard) until Theo flees back to New York to join Hobie in his antiques restoration business - and the complex life that follows.The tenor of the novel is very well captured by the fine cast, the exceptionally fine musical score, the stunning cinematography, and the sensitivity to all forms of art. The prolonged enactment of this near inextricable story allows the viewer to grow with the characters - and discover valuable insights as to art and life and their intersection or conjunction. Highly recommended on many levels.",The Goldfinch
10,deloudelouvain,"Good story, excellent actors, deserves a higher rating on here.",8,3 January 2021,"I have no clue what those people are on about stating the story is confusing or that there's no story at all. To me it all made perfect sense, in fact I thought the storytelling was sublime, going back and forth in time, between the young and adult characters, it was all very easy to follow for once. The acting was excellent and that from the entire cast. The Goldfinch definitely deserves a higher rating on here. It's one of those movies I would watch again in the future. I wasn't expecting much of it to be honest, as the drama genre isn't really the genre I enjoy the most but this one stands out from the rest. A captivating story, excellent acting, very high quality of cinematography, I really can't write anything bad about The Goldfinch. Good job from the whole production team.",The Goldfinch
11,JamesHitchcock,Jumps from flashback to flash-forward to yet another flashback,5,22 October 2019,"Let me state from the outset that I have never read Donna Tartt's novel, so my criticisms of this movie are not those of the ""loved the book, hated the film"" school of thought. A woman named Audrey Decker is killed in a terrorist bomb attack at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The film is not about the terrorists- we never learn who they are or what their motives are- but about Audrey's thirteen-year-old son Theo. He is with his mother when she is killed, but survives, and staggers out of the museum holding a painting, ""The Goldfinch"" by Carel Fabritius. (Tartt chose this painting because of its history. Fabritius was killed in a gunpowder explosion in 1654, which also destroyed his workshop and many of his paintings. ""The Goldfinch"" was in the building at the time, but survived).Audrey was divorced from her deadbeat alcoholic husband, Larry, who never showed any interest in his son, so Theo is placed with the Barbours, the family of one of his friends. He takes ""The Goldfinch"" with him and keeps it in his room; the museum authorities never make any attempt to trace it, assuming that it had been destroyed in the bombing. He bonds well with the family, who share his interest in art and antiques, and they consider adopting him, but before they can do so, Larry and his girlfriend Xandra reappear, reclaim Theo, and take him back to their home in the suburbs of Las Vegas. While living there, Theo makes a friend in Boris, the son of a Ukrainian immigrant, who will play an important role in his later life. After Larry is killed in a car crash, Theo runs away from Las Vegas and returns to New York, where he is taken in by Hobie, an antique dealer and restorer whose acquaintance he made while living with the Barbours. Theo's love of antiques increases, and when he becomes an adult he goes into the antiques trade, becoming Hobie's partner. ""The Goldfinch"" will play an important part in all his subsequent adventures.The critical consensus on the Rotten Tomatoes website describes the film as ""Beautifully filmed yet mostly inert"", but the word ""inert"" does not seem to me to be appropriate. The above synopsis is arranged in chronological order, but this is not the order in which events happen in the film itself, as its timeline has a particularly complex structure. The word I would use to describe it is not ""inert"" but ""frenetic""; it jumps all over the place, from flashback to flash-forward to yet another flashback, making the story difficult, and at times near-impossible to follow. My synopsis also simplifies the plot considerably, omitting as it does Theo's two romantic attachments and the confusing thriller-style ending which involves Theo and his old friend Boris tangling with a drugs gang. (Don't ask why).The film does have some positive aspects. There are also some interesting contrasts between two different Americas, the world of the Barbours, literate, cultured and metropolitan Manhattanites and that of the philistine Larry and Xandra who live in a largely deserted housing development on the edge of the desert, a long way from anything that looks like civilisation. Director John Crowley seems to be using the emptiness and barrenness of the desert landscapes as a metaphor for the emptiness and barrenness of their lives.The ""beautifully filmed"" part of the Rotten Tomatoes verdict strikes me as accurate, and there are some good acting performances, especially from Oakes Fegley as the young Theo Jeffrey Wright as his mentor Hobie and Nicole Kidman (a star whose undoubted talent for acting is not always matched by a talent for picking the right films) in a supporting role as Samantha Barbour, the woman who almost becomes Theo's adopted mother and who nurtures his interest in the arts. (I was less taken by Ansel Elgort as the adult Theo or by some of the other actors). The film's few virtues, however, were never enough in my opinion to compensate for its manifest faults. 5/10",The Goldfinch
12,blanbrn,A film of memory and painful flashbacks as life changes and expands.,7,16 September 2019,"""The Goldfinch"" is one long drawn out in depth drama film that's a journey of life and time of one young man who has been affected by tragedy and family. Based on an award winning play the movie is a coming of age story as it leaves the world of a New York City bombing in an art museum. Look for good supporting turns from heavyweights like Nicole Kidman, Sarah Paulson, and Luke Wilson. Overall just an okay drama journey that's moved along by time and flashbacks.",The Goldfinch
13,MOscarbradley,A wonderfully solid 'epic'.,9,5 October 2019,"Firstly, I haven't read Donna Tartt's Pulitzer Prize winning novel so I can't say just how good or how bad John Crowley's screen version is in comparison but purely as an epic piece of cinema with a multi-layered plot and a host of characters, (the book has been described as 'Dickensian'), this film is very good indeed. For anyone still unfamiliar with the story, it's about a boy who survives a bombing at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in which his mother is killed. The Goldfinch of the title is the painting they were looking at when the bomb went off.The film covers a number of years. Two actors play the film's central character, Theo Decker; as a child he is played by the remarkably gifted Oakes Fegley and as an adult by Ansel Elgort. They are both superb, particularly young Fegley who gives an Oscar-worthy performance. After his mother's death he is initially taken in by the Barbour family in which the dominant figure is the mother, (a superb Nicole Kidman). This is at least until his up-to-now absent father, (Luke Wilson), and his mistress, (Sarah Paulson), drag him off to the very fringes of Las Vegas where his only friend is a young drug-taking, vodka-drinking Russian who might also be gay or at least bisexual. Then there is the 'alternate' story where he is also taken in by a not wholly legitimate antique dealer and furniture restorer, (Jeffrey Wright). I did say there was a lot of plot.Much of the criticism levelled at the film is that Tartt's book was basically 'unfilmable' to begin with but if that was the case then let me say that screenwriter Peter Straughan has done a remarkable job of drawing all the plot strands together and in juggling the leaps back and forth in time. All the performances are excellent and Crowley shows great skill in handling the younger performers. Yes, it takes its time and yes, it does require a good deal of commitment from its audience but this is an adventure well worth taking particularly if, like me, you are unfamiliar with the book and can simply enjoy this marvellous film for what it is.",The Goldfinch
14,ThomasDrufke,"Not a Disaster, But Certainly a Disappointment",5,21 September 2019,"It's always disappointing when a film releases one of the best trailers (and I thought marketing campaigns overall) this year and then film comes out and bombs the way The Goldfinch did. And it doesn't help that the film itself isn't all that good to begin with. Packed with solid acting, gorgeous cinematography, and a story that should be extraordinary to tell on the big screen, The Goldfinch has every part of the process down for success, except for the execution. It was one of my most anticipated films of the back half of 2019, and sadly it's one of the bigger letdowns of the last few years. But it's also far from the atrocity some critics are making it out to be. It's certainly watchable, but it's far too long for repeated viewings.5.9/10",The Goldfinch
15,westsideschl,Special Features,7,22 December 2019,"Positives:
1. Liked the special features where the museum housing the painting discussed its history & location.

Negatives:

2. Why the bombing & what happened after.
3. The home placement & then replacement seemed stretchy & not too believable.

17,Dr_Coulardeau,Slightly far-fetched,8,6 March 2021,"It is the strangest film you can imagine. A 13-year-old when his mother is killed nearly next to himself in The Metropolitan Art Museum in New York by a terrorist attack of some sort that is not really explained, steals a small painting and goes away with it. This painting will lead him into an extraordinary ""adventure"" in crime country, though it is not very clear what could interest any drug dealing mafia in this painting of a simple bird on a simple box. The painting will eventually be stolen from him and he will have to run internationally to recapture it and return to where it should have been all along.Apart from this plot that is for me weak as suspense because hardly sustainable, the film has some interest for completely different reasons.On the day of the terrorist attack, Theodore Decker, the boy, makes eye contact with a girl his age or so, and the man with her will be killed by the bombing. That will lead Theo to look for her and he will thus be introduced to the business and personal partner of the dead man. The business of the two men was antique dealing. Theo will become the assistant of the survivor of the couple and even his associate at some point along the line. There is some emotional content there but that is rather simple.The next interest is the acting of the actor who is playing this 13-year-old boy. The acting is complex and complicated to express the trauma as well as the going over this trauma with, along the way, some events that will remain in his mind and yet will not lead him anywhere, like his very short relationship with a Russian boy, Boris, slightly older than him he met in New Mexico and then leaves behind when he decides to go back to New York, still at his early teenage time.This Russian youngster, when Theodore is an adult, will come back into the picture to help him solve the problem of the disappeared painting. As a Russian by origin, he is in contact with the Russian mafia, and through this connection, he happens to know who has the painting and he suggests going to Amsterdam in order to buy the painting from the criminal circle that has it. But it turns into a trap.Then everything gets confused but ends well with a few dead people on the ground and a few wounded people too, on the run, among others his Russian friend but Theo develops a sense of guilt and tries to commit suicide, but he is saved by his Russian friend. Back in New York, he gets ready to get married, and yet the old relationship with his Russian friend is still active and the end is not clear at all, though as usual, the hopeful will imagine the two friends of their teenage time will become friends again in their adult time. But that might be wishful thinking because normalcy is so attractive, and it may become a real chain tying you down in your seat.It is just interesting but not really outstanding.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Goldfinch
18,eddie_baggins,A squandered adaptation,4,2 March 2020,"Somewhere there's a great story to be told cinematically in the adaptation of Donna Tartt's critically acclaimed and best-selling novel The Goldfinch, but that version of the tricky to bring to life tale is not to be found in John Crowley's dull and overwrought feature film.One of 2019's biggest commercial and critical disappointments, Goldfinch's troubles are hard to pin down exactly but the crux of this troubled adaptations problems stem clearly from a lifeless and tiresome execution, one that squanders an able bodied cast and narrative potential in two and a half hours of screen-time that will see you looking at your watch tick by on more than a few occasions.Crowley has previously proven to be a fine dramatic director with films such as Brooklyn and the underrated Andrew Garfield vehicle Boy A, but from the opening 20 to 30 minutes you sense the filmmaker is in a bit of bother as he struggles to find the heart of this tale of young boy Theo and his transition into young adult life as he tries to overcome a tragedy that killed his mother in an art exhibition.Much of the films run-time will have you wondering why certain scenes are even in the film, as Theo feels like a passenger to countless scenarios of setups and potential, yet while young actor Oakes Fegley delivers a strong turn and Ansel Elgort zombies his way through his role, we never feel much of a connection to Theo or the underwritten supports that surround his story.There's star power aplenty as the likes of Jeffrey Wright, Nicole Kidman, Luke Wilson, Sarah Paulson and Finn Wolfhard show up through Crowley's tale but none of them ever come to a place of fully formed creations as they help trudge Theo's story along.From countless moments of unbelievable chance encounters (in the bustling streets of New York nevertheless!) through to unearned friendships and relationships, nothing in The Goldfinch comes to a place of well-rounded fulfilment or interest, never more so evident than a bizarre final section that feels as though it's from a whole different film entirely.Luckily for Crowley he had the likes of DOP Roger Deakins on board behind the scenes, as while Goldfinch will leave you cold and empty emotionally on a human level, the craftsmanship on show in a film-making sense is of an extremely high quality.Final Say -The Goldfinch source material could make a great film if the stars aligned but this version of Theo's unfortunate life is not that movie, as John Crowley struggles to breathe life into his emotionally empty epic.2 pieces of antique furniture out of 5",The Goldfinch

20,subxerogravity,Well told story,7,17 September 2019,"The Goldfinch was made by the same guy who made Brooklyn, John Crowrely. I thought Brooklyn was an excellent work of filmmaking. Just technically perfect so I was curious to see what he would do with this film.
Brooklyn was a movie that could have been real boring in the hands of a lessor director but this Crowley made the simple story truly energetic.
The Goldfich starts out that way but one difference is that he had a lot of star power to keep us intrigued (past his filmmaking skills). It definitely helps to have some known faces like Nicole Kidman to keep the story going.
Second, the Goldfinch is not as mundane a story as Brooklyn. It's got a good story arch and a lot of dramatic tones built into the story. Although the characters' motives seemed other worldly to me, the universe this kid comes form just seems very different from mine so relating was odd.
Yet still I did like the story and I never got bored of watching it so very good.",The Goldfinch

I didn't know much about this movie before seeing it. I had heard that it was based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel. I had seen the trailers-but I couldn't tell much about it, having not read the novel. Oakes plays a 13 year old boy that is at an art museum with his mother when a terrorist bombing kills his mother-they were in separate rooms at the time of the explosion. The Goldfinch is a picture that Oakes was looking at when the bomb went off. The painting is presumed destroyed in the blast or pilfered by someone. Luke plays Oakes' father, who ran off with another woman before the tragedy left Oakes an orphan. Nicole takes Oakes under her roof and tries to give him a home but Luke pops back into the picture and wants Oakes to stay with him and his new girlfriend. Ansel plays the adult version of Oakes. Jeffrey plays an antiques dealer that befriends and then later hires Oakes to work in his shop.

It's well done in terms of cinematography and mood but vague as a whole. Flashbacking and forward, I was just about to give up on it and then about 38 minutes in stuff finally started to happen. Following an explosion at the museum of art, Theo's mothers death, his theft of a noteworthy painting and brief adoption by a wealthy upper east side family in New York. Theo's dad Luke Wilson and girlfriend Sarah Paulson show up and take him home with them.Theo life changes, he hangs with his new friend, drinking and doing drugs. Still not great but at least holding my attention now. Drugs, suicide, a shootout, a twist, none of it really all that interesting. Powerful acting from all involved though and strange to see Luke Wilson as a bad guy, well at least a not so nice guy. Nicole Kidman's character is strange; aloof, detached, extremely proper, which is never explained.Ultimately this movie did nothing for me, I do remember the book being everywhere it was very popular",The Goldfinch

30,jadepietro,Winging It,4,18 September 2019,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: The Goldfinch is a well-intentioned but dull adaptation that remains earthbound.JIM'S REVIEW: I haven't read the popular book, a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Donna Tartt, and the source of inspiration for John Crowley's disappointing cinematic mush, The Goldfinch. (However, for what it's worth, Carel Fabritius' gorgeous 15th century masterwork is remarkable and I would rather view that painting for 2½ hours than sit through this muddled turgid melodrama.)This is not to say the film isn't well made. It is. Production values like Roger Deakin's superb photography and Trevor Gureckis' lyrical music score give the film a fine pedigree. The acting is first rate as well. But despite everyone's noble intentions, the resulting film never flies. It is continually weighed down by a convoluted plot, sketchy characters, and a film structure that lunges back and forth in time that confuses rather than defines. It is as if huge chunks of the story are lost in translation with many scenes and various actions unexplained.The story revolves around the troubled life of a young boy named Theo who loses his mother in a terrorist bombing at a museum. His last vestige of memory, before this traumatic event occurred, is a small delicate painting of a chained bird which he later steals and covets as his symbolic final connection to his dead parent. His guilt remains overwhelming. As Theo grows up and grieves alone, he encounters many dramatic changes in his life: a semi-happy time with a wealthy but cold family, a sad lonely episode with his drunken father and floozie of a girlfriend, rampant drug and alcohol use with a Russian teenage friend, and some semblance of love and kindness from an antique dealer who befriends him. Yet somehow, this orphan leads a successful life as an adult. Although how he achieves the good life is only suggested, with no background or exposition mentioned or shown.That's a lot to cover, perhaps too much. With so much dense plotting, the film is a bit of a confusing slog, meandering from past to present and back again. Most of the characters lack depth and their motives and behavior seems enigmatic. A few figures are introduced into the storyline and later unceremoniously forgotten.The fault of this film's demise lies squarely in the mishandled screenplay adaptation by Peter Straughan. Rather than streamline or eliminate the many unnecessary subplots, the film's penchant for chance meetings are merely unbelievable plot devices that push along the action. The Goldfinch is overloaded with these contrivances and far fetched coincidences, all of which, never add up.As I said before, the acting is strong, but the cast deserves better. Ansel Elgort plays the older Theo and Oakes Fegley is his younger self and both are very good in their roles. One actually cares about them, unlike the other walking and talking cliches posing as characters. Also good are Anuerin Barnard and Finn Wolfhard as Theo's misguided friend, Boris. The remainder of the ensemble are caught in their stock characters. Providing fine support are such reliable actors as Jeffrey Wright, Denis O'Hare, Luke Wilson, and Sarah Paulson. However, Nicole Kidman never makes any sense in her interpretation of the distant but classy Mrs. Barbour. She is strictly one-dimensional, despite and/or because of, the material.As for The Goldfinch, I didn't like the movie much, but I sure did love the painting.",The Goldfinch

The VERDICT:The Gold Finch feels like an Oscar film primarily in the in-depth story and artistic presentation. It is super detailed, amazing character development and utilizes the movie magic of sound editing, cinematography, and music to craft incredibly emotional sequences. The acting further brings the world to life, again the young Fegley taking port, crafting a strong character and the keystone for keeping this story building. Despite all the story and character development though, the movie is dry, dense, and very drawn out that may not be in everyone's repertoire for a movie. In addition, after trying to build up for a finale to blow you away, the execution did not quite go the way I had intended, leading to a rushed finale that did not utilize the talents of the actors well, hit the full-on potential of the crime component, and thus fizzes out after so much time spent waiting. It's a movie that again feels like it should remain in book form, and thus is not going to be for everyone to view, reserved to those who are fans of the book, or looking for a deep, dark, nonfiction.My scores are:Drama: 7.0

33,eric262003,Had Potential But Greatly Failed,5,22 June 2021,"Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Donna Tartt, ""The Goldfinch"" is about Theo Decker (Oakes Fegley and Ansel Elgort) who's life takes an unexpected turn as his mother died in an explosion at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The cause of the explosion was an act done by terrorism. The tragedy of the events change the outlook of his life as experience heartbreak, grief, guilt, redemption and rebuilding. Through the course of this emotional roller coaster ride in his life, he holds with him a painting of the famous paining of The Goldfinch by Dutch artist Carel Fabritius.Under the direction of John Crowley, ""The Goldfinch"" succeeds in so many way, but it's not because it's a cinematic masterpiece. It's because it had so much potential to be one as the film goes by, sadly due to the badly done script, the film ends becoming convoluted and incoherent.Surely ""The Goldfinch"" had the rightful fundamentals to get the attention of the people when awards ceremony was around the corner. The direction from Crowley was very well executed. The cast featured top notch performers of well knowns like Nicole Kidman, Luke Wilson, Sarah Paulson, and relative unknowns like Oakes Fegley. And of course we can't ignore the brilliant cinematography by one of the best in the business namely Roger Deakins.There's a lot to appreciate about ""The Goldfinch"" no question about it. It was script that really ruined the making of what would have been an Oscar-calibre film. Donna Tartt's novel was met with positive reviews due to its intriguing story, remarkable characters, and moments that likely catch you off guard. But all the quirks that made Miss Tartt's novel fascinating doesn't seem to manifest well on the big screen. The dialogue feels drab and mundane and is just used as a tool to keep the film running. For a film with a 2 hours and 30 minute runtime, everything felt rushed giving little time to absorb with the characters and the plot.It's also a shame that the film has so many scenes, there's very little to remember. The material was there to make something great only to discover that in the end there was very little that came out of it. And sure it pays respect to the author and the scenes featured here are handled with care. But the emotional tug never fully materializes.I also found the editing and musical backdrops to be a bit eccentric and even at times it gets on my nerves. It's just that the quick cuts tend to become to frequent to the point where you end up in a bed of confusion.I had no objection with performances featured here. Ansel Elgort was especially amazing in his performance as the adult Theo Decker. In his young career as a performer, Decker has performed wonderfully in roles like ""Baby Driver"" and ""The Fault in our Stars"". Here he delivers equally impressive here. The other performers in the ensemble were also very good in what the material was given to them like Nicole Kidman, Finn Wolfhard and Sarah Paulson. It's a shame their talent was wasted on mediocre material.The real standout here comes from the cinematography from the legendary Roger Deakins. Whatever he touches turns to gold. He has been responsible for creating some of the most beautiful scenery in films like ""Skyfall"", ""Blade Runner 2049"", and ""No Country for Old Men"". He could film paint dry and make it look stunning in detail. The shots featured in this movie are quite tantalizing and there is never a mundane piece of scenery which is a relief on all cylinders.Aside from the great cast and the majestic cinematography from Roger Deakins, ""The Goldfinch"" is a plodding, boring film that for a two and a half hour film actually feels like an eternity. Also once the rolling credit ends, you'll forget about what you just saw.",The Goldfinch

I would not spare much of your time by wasting it on such hollow and bloodless mess as The Goldfinch is. The story - dragging slowly for 2 endless painful hours. The casting - Nicole, Sarah and Luke were okay, The rest is just a stale shade of the pale shadow.
The music is similarly boring, and the long shots only add to sepia-tones misery of a film.
My general impression was that of a yawning shock - wow, are you serious here, blokes. They are deadly serious by making this slimey slow sloth of a movie.

To my mind the source material was so poor it could never make a good movie so why was it made at all, why blow 50 million on this tripe. Some source material does not a movie make, look at Cats or David Copperfield, or indeed Death in Venice and yet Star Wars is only cinematic.

36,jromanbaker,Pseudo Dickensian,3,6 November 2020,"I have not read the book, and have had no desire to do so. Judging by this mish-mash of a film adaptation it seems to me obliquely related to Charles Dicken's novels. Of course the plot ( which is so convoluted it made me want to scream ) is not related to any, but watched closely, as I did the trace elements are there of Dicken's world. In fact Finn Wolfhard as a Russian could have come out of any Dickens novel you could name. He even looks as if he has come out of the 19th C. I will pass on the acting as even Nicole Kidman looked coldly estranged from the whole film giving a kind of zombie/Stepford wives performance. I like her as an actor but this to me was a performance going through the motions. The only parts that grabbed me were the war zone scenes set in the museum, all grey and blurred and savage in their barren feel and look. Other than that the film and direction was dull, concentrating on images that advanced nothing. In fact most of the characters seemed to be played in a zombie state showing ( for me ) little that I could hold on to on a psychological level, which means of course my lack of interest in them. In my opinion this is a near total failure of a cinematic experience on all levels; the drama drained to freezing points and when you are concentrating on the objects around the actors instead of at the actors you know a film is in trouble.
But for those who have read the book they will want to see the film. A 3 for the scene in the museum with the dying man in the debris and the tremendously powerful and realistic after shock of a deadly massacre, all too relevant for our current world.",The Goldfinch

40,rockman182,The Goldfinch (2019),6,16 September 2019,"When Brooklyn came out in 2015, I was mesmerized by the sheer beauty of the picture visually, the story, and the all around fantastic performance by Saoirse Ronan. It was a great effort by John Crowley. So when I heard of The Goldfinch I had high expectations seeing as Crowley set the bar high with his last film. I didn't really care for the trailers though I knew it was based on a well acclaimed book. What can I say, this film is overlong, has a messy narrative, and most definitely has to be losing the meaning and importance of the book because this film is not remarkable.The film is about a boy who loses his mom in a terrorist attack and then grows up in a foster home and then with his drunken and abusive biological father, followed by a friendly antique owner. The film goes through the protagonists struggle with identity, love, and the fact that he took a really expensive Goldfinch painting the day of the bombing, and this last fact comes back in to factor in different stages of his life. Even describing the plot just now was messy for me.The film looks quite nice. Crowley's works look grand and intricate but that doesn't really cross the finish line. The main issue with this film is that it has no heart and loses what I assume is a lot of the books importance. Its a meandering tale that doesn't go deep enough and I felt like the last twenty minutes or so were just bad. The relevance of The Goldfinch is just lost on me and its just a moving plot device in a film that doesn't know what it wants to do.I don't like to say it but The Goldfinch is masking around as Oscar bait but doesn't have a whole lot of quality. I didn't read Brooklyn either but the film feels magical and captures the era and aura of early 1900s Irish Brooklyn. This just feels like it sucks the main ideas of its basis and pastes it onto the screen. At a whopping 2 and a half hours, this film feels its length. Ambitious? Yes, but most certainly better left alone.6/10",The Goldfinch
41,spookyrat1,Picture Needs Re-framing!,5,31 August 2020,"As in life in general, certain filming techniques become extremely fashionable. Such an example is flashing back/flashing forward/jumps in time. Flashbacks have been in vogue since Adam was a boy, but generally jumping around in time, rather than straight linear storytelling, has really gained in popularity since Quentin Tarantino used it to such acclaimed effect in Pulp Fiction.Now for some strange reason, director John Crowley has decided his cinematic adaption of The Goldfinch from the popular 2013 novel of the same name by Donna Tartt, requires this sort of treatment. For the life of me, I just can't understand why. In my experience, it works best when used in the mystery/thriller genres; when providing unexpected surprises or twists to the storyline.But utilising it in The Goldfinch, which in spite of its flashy visual look, is just a drawn out, two and a half hour melodrama is just bizarre and a completely retro-grade step. All it serves to do, is to keep breaking up the continuity of narrative flow.The movie feels like we're watching a thematically organized, but disjointed drama that sometimes feels like three separate movies jammed together. It isn't a happy story although the style and approach of director Crowley and screenwriter Peter Straughan attempt to blunt the emotionally traumatic aspects of the story by these jumps in time, thereby giving the sense that Theo, our protagonist, at least survives some of his ordeals.As implied earlier, Roger Deakins cinematography is quite arresting and goes some way to rewarding those prepared to give up a fair proportion of their time to watch this slow-paced, Dickensian - flavoured, coming-of-age tale. Acting is solid without being exceptional. The standout in my opinion is Oakes Fegley, as young Theo, who loses his mother during a bombing at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. He fits nicely into the part of a young fellow, who has a heavier emotional load to lift than the normal Joe Citizen, growing up in varied family environments.The Goldfinch is at times plodding and it struggles mightily to retain the viewer's interest during its slower moments. I feel its story would have had more telling impact and sustained interest, if Crowley had employed a more traditional means of delivering it. As it stands, it's is an overlong, shallow production that seeks to be seen as more important than it is.",The Goldfinch

43,tm-sheehan,Read the Book instead,6,30 September 2019,"My Review/ The GoldfinchMy rating 6/10 (for the performances)This is a film that I think the trailer is better than the movie but it's a puzzle for me because at times in the movie I thought I liked it then some strange flashback or cut to the present time would interrupt the story narrative and Id lose interest.I suspect The Goldfinch as a novel by the American author Donna Tartt must be much better than its movie adaptation.
It won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and is a best seller . I haven't read it yet but will have to forget the movie before I do.I found the performances very good , especially Oakes Fegley ( he played Charlie in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on Broadway) as young Theo and Ansel Elgort as the adult Theo Decker The supporting cast is also very good especially Nicole Kidman as Mrs Barbour ( strange seeing lovely Nicole aged and frail) Sarah Paulson as Xandra the lush and Finn Wolfhard as young Boris.The main problem for me in this movie is the length of it 2 hours 20, The mood is very depressing as well as the dull score by Trevor Gureckis and most of all the editing it's all over the place .I like a story to flow not be disjointed unless it's necessary to the overall narrative, it may work in a novel where there's so much detail but not always on screen . This movie is more like a jigsaw puzzle that I put away after losing interest.

The problem with this attempt to dramatize the book is that each thread is too thin and the various threads are not woven together in a satisfying way. It all feels a bit random. I have to agree with those reviewers who are saying that this should have been a series, not a feature-length film. Let this be a lesson to those who would adapt acclaimed works of literature: best stick to short stories or single chapters. It may be impossible adequately to adapt a full-length novel.A more specific criticism of content (as opposed to form) is that the depiction of the Ukrainian/Russian character Boris is cartoonishly stereotypical.",The Goldfinch
45,Alexander_Blanchett,Way better than critics make it out to be,8,24 November 2019,"Now I really liked this movie. I dont know why it was abandoned by audiences and some critics. No, I did not read the source novel so I cannot compare it but if I look at the film itself it really worked for me and captured my throughout. The story was very captivating and so were the characters. I really did care for Theo and what he went though and was extremely interested in his development. Some critics discussed the structure of the film that was a bit... over the place... well I did not feel it that way. Maybe just when at the end it turns into a thriller and that flow did not really go well with the rest of the movie but other than that I though John Crowley did a great job, especially mixing past and present.
Acting wise I was really more than satisfied as well. Ansel Elgort did a great job in the leading role and was the perfect equivalent to the wonderful Oakes Fegley who is the true heart of soul of the film and proves himself once again as one of the greatest kid actors out there. Also Finn Wolfhard did a wonderful job. Besides the kids and Elgort there were powerhouse performances by Jeffrey Wright and Nicole Kidman.
Sarah Paulson totally left her usual territory with her role, and while it was good, it was sometimes a bit too cartoonish.
I really liked the music of it and the camera work by Roger Deakins was great. Another aspect that could have been executed better would have been to tie some lose ends when it came to the character relationships. I felt there was something left out and I can imagine the novel did better in that aspect. But still it is a very rich story, good acting cinema with many moving moments. I recommend it for sure.",The Goldfinch

The story tells itself in it's own way with it's own reveal. It had a satisfying resolution. some threads were left unraveled. which left it hanging, maybe not so in the book. I would say that 90% of the time, a film or TV show doesn't measure up to a good (or great) book. Iam not measuring this by how true to the book (whihch I ddin't read) but whether it entertained.for example, I dislike the Agatha Christies made from books. and never wanted to read her bec of it. trying to be true to the book, rather than make it something that plays on screen, may not always work.

48,sweidman-28016,Not As Bad As Critics Say,4,26 September 2019,"The Goldfinch Review:The Goldfinch is based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel following 13-year-old Theo Decker's life as it's turned upside-down when his mother is killed in a terrorist attack at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Confused in the rubble of the tragedy, he steals a priceless piece of art known as The Goldfinch. I've been excited for this movie for a very long time. Ever since I saw the trailer I thought this is a movie that will win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. That is until I saw The Farewell so I bumped it down. Having an all-star cast, director James Crowley, and the legend Roger Deakins as the cinematographer, this movie couldn't be bad if it tried. Then it premiered at TIFF and everything changed. To my surprise it was (and still is) rated one of the worst movies of the year. All the Oscar buzz died at that moment (except for Roger Deakins brilliant cinematography which I do agree is beautiful). Still I was curious to see the plot and why everyone just hated this movie. Now, I can understand why critics just bashed this movie. I agree with some of the stuff their saying. However, I honestly don't think this is a horrible movie. It's not as great as I wanted it to be, but it's not like I wasn't aching to leave the theater. The struggle really comes from the plot and narrative. Altogether the story is fine, it's just there was a lot of trouble keeping it consistent. Certain events seemed out of place, there was random jumps from present to past, and the third act felt like a whole different movie. If you piece it together yourself the story is mostly good. It jumps right into the story and just keeps going. I enjoyed the first act. I think one thing that hurt it was keeping the audience from experiencing the event of the bombing until the very end. I had trouble feeling much for the characters. Theo goes through so much as a child, played by Oakes Fegley who is the star of the movie, and it's tragic. He doesn't show much emotion when dealing with the trauma which I don't know if it's intentional or not. That didn't bother me too much. I wasn't the biggest fan of Amstel Elgort's portrayal. I guess it's because he had the story that was messy and didn't make much sense to me. For other standout acting, Finn Wolfhard was pretty good. He had some trouble with the accent at times but I liked his character. Sarah Paulson is good in this as well. Her weird crying actually does work in this. The rest of the acting was fine. The technical side of this was pretty good. Like I said the cinematography was beautiful. The score by Trevor Gureckis is good. Overall a good technical aspect. This is a controversial movie because critics are just bashing it and people don't think it's that bad. I don't think this is a bad movie. I understand the problems, but I can see myself watching it again. I think critics were a little too critical but oh well. I could just talk about the messy story forever. And also despite the title being The Goldfinch, the painting felt very insignificant to me. I didn't understand much of why he takes the painting but maybe it's better explained in the novel. This is a fine movie with not much to talk about other than the plot, but I've said quite enough. Not many will see this and I can understand. I've waited to write this for a while since I'm just looking at both point of views from various viewers. If you want to watch it and do so, I'd love to hear your thoughts.My Grade: B-",The Goldfinch

So, whenever a screen adaptation of a novel is announced, a segment of its readers will claim that to adapt it for the screen it's ""unfilmable"". The problems usually arise when directors attempt to film the novel, rather than turning the novel into a movie and that is happening here. The film is exceedingly long (149 minutes), continually cuts back and forth through time, and with it's dull narrative structure feels disjointed especially toward the end. It is also little bit boring and miscast (in almost every role) no matter that I did really liked Nicole Kidman's intensity and melancholy. On the other hand, the story almost never makes sense enough for viewer to truly figure out what and why it is all happening. The elements were all there but director missed the opportunity failing to deliver any kind of actual payoff in its conclusion. In the end, maybe you can read Donna Tartt's best-selling book to fill in the blanks left by the film.Rating: 6+/7- just because of Nicole Kidman and Jeffrey Wright",The Goldfinch
51,iamjamalwhite,Zzzzzzzzzzz,2,17 December 2019,"Most boring movie of 2019. Surprised this didn't have Meryl Streep in it! Wow, we made an hour before the wife was asleep and I tapped out. This is one of those books that is great but the movie is a snooze fest. Skip it!",The Goldfinch
52,cgvsluis,This was a nice tightly told story that doesn't dumb down for the common denominator.,4,19 December 2020,"This film is based on the Donna Tartt novel of the same name which gets its inspiration from an actual painting of the same title, painted by a Dutch golden age painter. This painting, the Goldfinch, was one of only a dozen paintings that survived by the painter Carel Fabritius who died in an explosion of the nearby Delft Gunpowder Magazine Factory. Carel Fabritius was probably the most promising of Rembrandt's students.
What an amazing true-life inspiration for this story, which Donna Tartt uses to take us on an equally interesting journey with lots of tie-ins to true life.
The film's backdrop is New York, Las Vegas and Amsterdam. The film is told in a slow but unapologetic style, that asks you to just come along for the journey. The actor who plays young Theo does an amazing job and is supported by some big name actors, a few who fall just shy of being charactures of a stereotype.
Heavy drug use and interestingly enough a lot of metal/psychological issues that never get dealt with...like I don't know any kid who goes through that kind of trauma who doesn't see a shrink?!?!
There were several smart choices for the film...like the multiple timelines and when we first see and hear the mom fully. Tying in antiques and antique restoration to the story added a really nice touch and I think helped the audience get in to the right frame of mind...appreciating the craftsmanship of the past.
Thoroughly enjoyed the film, highly recommend it. It inspired me to want to read the book!",The Goldfinch
53,W011y4m5,Is it just me who wanted The Goldfinch to be more gay?,7,26 January 2020,"I've no idea if the novel is more open & unafraid with its representation of the complex / potential LGBT relationships featured in this adaptation but to have two young male characters kiss - immediately establishing some level of romantic intimacy - & then to disregard this progression once we entered the adulthood part of the storyline - depicting their bond as purely platonic, refusing to continue with the development in their personal narrative felt jarringly distracting & regressive, bordering on shamelessly queer-baiting.How is one supposed to follow the plot if there's no consistency or coherence in the dynamics between characters? How are we - as an audience - meant to distinguish what sort of connection they have if the filmmaker can't even seem to decide amongst themselves either?The inclusion of a deeper implication - which is then subsequently back-tracked upon shortly afterwards seems cowardly, predictable & disappointing.I mean yes, the film's competently made & beautifully shot by the legendary Roger Deakins but unfortunately, the movie's mired by a reluctance to delve into the most interesting parts of its premise & that is ultimately what makes this a sadly wasted opportunity, if nothing else.",The Goldfinch
54,thebricks,"Nice throwback movie, terrible marketing though",10,1 December 2019,"I wanted to hate this movie. Everything about the film's marketing was pretentious and insufferable. The first twenty minutes, thirty minutes was insufferable. I just hated everyone. It definitely picks up when the film goes to Vegas and becomes a story worth telling.I see that the critics gave this terrible reviews but lauded praise on Ford vs. Ferrari and Knives Out? Seriously? Those were both absolutely terrible, sorry. Goldfinch was way better than both of those movies and I will challenge anyone to pick the better movie of the three themselves.Don't trust the critics this time. Marvelous story, haven't read the book but I had a great time. I see a lot of reviewers on here complaining about the length but I will chalk that up to ADD audiences that don't understand what nuance is. There was a lot in this film, some I felt that people just missed completely. Like Scorcese insinuated, comic book movies have done a lot to ruin film in that younger generations don't understand what a story is for anymore. Maybe that's why movies like Knives Out are getting spectacular reviews when it's lowest-common denominator film-making.It's a shame, give this a chance, thank you.",The Goldfinch

57,Hallelujah289,"Decent, but the ending is rushed",8,26 June 2020,"Never read the book. The movie has a lot going for it. It's one of the better Amazon Originals. It has a lot of mood and atmosphere. Some of it doesn't exactly pay off but I appreciated the thickness of the mood that was being created anyway. All the characters have a certain gravity to them which lends the film an air of something special and well made and considered. I think a lot of the middle is very good, mostly because it plays like a coming of age story. But the beginning and end were a bit too forced, like something out of a thriller, and was trying to compress too much in a few scenes. Despite these pacing and set up issues, The Goldfinch is a worthy endeavor with much that is well constructed about it. I think it has important things to say about things not lasting, even though I didn't totally buy the meaning of the goldfinch painting and why it was so important. I think was probably another aspect that made the actions of the final act a question mark for me.",The Goldfinch
58,ferdinand1932,Airless,4,20 November 2019,"Normally movies transfer average books into the medium. Good or even great books don't work so well for many reasons. The case here is that the book was overrated, contrived, smug and dull. It was the sort of book that does nothing for literary fiction; rather, it is deracinated and pretentious.At its heart it had a hero, a teenage boy, who behaved and thought like a middle-aged woman. He had no semblance to an adolescent male, not even a literary adolescent at all. And so it marched through the sheer tedium of its own arch complexity and literary affectation. The plot- not the story - underlines those defects; while the story is not sufficient to hold the eyelids open.The bulk of the novel was a necessary trick to convince that it was a work of substance. A sham trick, as ever. Making the film two and half hours is an arrogant touch. Shakespeare told most of his plays in that time and they have more vigor than this pastiche of a drama.It is not surprising that the movie has ironed out the entire work and made it stupefying and fatuous. In that respect it holds true to the novel but how something that narrates in prose could ever be seen as vivid on screen is a mystery.There are many better books and better films than this one.",The Goldfinch
59,danybur,A necessarily fragmentary character drama with a novelistic breath Fragments of a life in a character drama,7,25 December 2020,"In a hotel room, the young Theodor (Ansel Elgort) reviews part of his life from the traumatic moment when, at the age of 13, he survives an attack at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in which he loses his mother.Based on a novel by Donna Tartt, and being quite faithful to it, John Crowley's film may be too ambitious and somewhat scattered. This may be, in part, due to its temporal structure, which alternates between the adult Theo and events from when he was 13 years old (by Oakes Fegley), due to the truncated nature of certain episodes, due to the variety of topics covered and due to certain disconnection between them. But this fragmentary character is consistent with the situation that the protagonist lives in the hotel and because of the nature of the events in a life that is not linear at all and with quite bad luck. Suddenly, Theo, at age 13, must choose and make decisions at an age when it is easy to make mistakes and when it is the adults who ultimately decide. Choices and decisions that have to do with who you want and choose to be, the value of objects, the world of art, taking care of yourself and the search for containment.With some moment of action, the film goes ahead however because it is a drama of well-constructed characters, for its novelistic breath and for the interpretations, starting with the remarkable performances of Fegley and Elgort, with whom it is impossible not to empathize. They are accompanied by a great cast, starting with the infallible Nicole Kidman (composing another of the interesting mothers that he has already given to the cinema) and continuing with Jeffrey Whright, Luke Wilson, a Sarah Paulson sexier than ever and an overwhelming Finn Wolfhart as his friend in adolescence.",The Goldfinch

61,tigerfish50,A Goldfinch on Eagle's Wings,8,31 October 2021,"The film adaptation of Donna Tartt's novel 'The Goldfinch' disappointed the critics and was a flop at the box office - and it isn't hard to see why. The novel had a labyrinthine Dickensian narrative with multiple characters, which played out over more than a decade, and Tartt wisely told her tale chronologically. The film's screenwriter or editor made the poor choice to construct a fragmented timeline which created unnecessary confusion and diminished the dramatic effect of several scenes .The novel's opening sequence relates how an adolescent boy and his mother visit an art museum on the day of a terrorist bombing, and after the blast the traumatized youngster has a crucial encounter with a fatally injured victim in the ruined galleries. The dying man presses him to take a ring from his finger along with a famous small painting of a goldfinch which was lying in the debris - with consequences which ripple down through the following years. Capriciously the film chooses to break this pivotal scene - the origin of all subsequent events - into short sequences scattered throughout the duration. Despite the difficulties arising from this decision, the cast deliver performances which give the story a similar mythic weight to the novel. Somehow these exceptional actors - in both lead and minor roles - manage to rescue the story from incoherence, and produce a work of great beauty and haunting emotional resonance. Far from being a disappointment, 'The Goldfinch' is an immense accomplishment. That said - to do true justice to this remarkable novel with its complex character development would probably require a TV series.",The Goldfinch

However, this film was much better than I thought it would be going from many of the IMDB reviews.
I love a story that tells of how one event/error/decision can turn a life into something which it might not have been, otherwise and so this movie was intriguing for me and although it's long and does require proper watching so you know full well what's going on, I think it was a great way to spend 2.5 hours.
The ending is the only part that I didn't like... I don't expect pat endings but it's as if the story just said, 'Ok, done now, quick, wrap up, viewer will cope with forever wondering.' I believe, from book reviews, that is how the books wraps up as well.
Otherwise, I really did enjoy this movie. The actors were good, the twists and turns and convoluted turnings were fun for me and not hard to follow.

Amstel Elgort in particular is excellent, eventually breaking loose in a maelstrom of addiction, self loathing, and pain. The story ranges broadly across the themes of who we are, who we choose to love, and how we see ourselves. It's a story of love, friendship, mothers and fathers, addictions, and reconciliation. The emotional drama is anchored by a tale of intrigue and an object d'art.If that's not enough for you, grab some paper and write your own screenplay. See how far you get.",The Goldfinch

It thought the back and forth to piece everything together was done nicely. I wasn't confused or bewildered at any point. The story was told in its entirety, some films just stop and never compete the story. This story had a beginning, middle and an end! I was afraid the ending wouldn't be kind to the viewers, luckily I was wrong...well in the ways of love maybe it didn't work out but it could've been worse!! The love and friendship Theo has with Mrs Barbour, Hobie and Boris prevailed...Theo just didn't get the girl he really loved. But he has a family now, and one with millions of dollars, so yeah, I say happy ending! I think Ansel Elgort did an amazing job! But I really like him so I may be biased. I thought the story was engaging with lots of players to keep us interested. The flashbacks keep you engaged too. It didn't move too slowly for me, I didn't get bored or wish it would hurry up and that happens a lot. Mostly in the ""critically acclaimed"" films. I'm staring to realize critics and I are on complete opposite ends of the spectrum usually. Anyway... Jeffrey Wright, Finn Wolfhard, Luke Wilson, Sarah Paulson and Nichole Kidman were all really good! I really like the Boris character, he added fun and flare, both were much needed in young Theo's life. Well, when Xandra wasn't on scene haha! All in all it was a good story and well told.

Not really big on modern best sellers, as far as that goes, however.In 2010 I was given an iPod Touch. In 2012, I bought a MacBook Air. I bet I've read a total of 12 books since 2012. Thanks, internet.One book I did read was ""The Goldfinch."" On an overseas trip in 2015, I carted that book from the USA to Norway, but without reading it. I gave it away to my Airbnb hosts. The thing (hardback) just weighed too damn much for me to keep lugging it around. I hope the recipient enjoyed the book and passed it along to others.When I got back to USA, I got another copy off eBay. Glad I did. One of the smartest things I've done. A great read.

76,helenbassett,"The Goldfinch Film Review - John Crowley Directs A Beautiful And Tactile Film Starring Ansel Elgort, Nicole Kidman & Jeffrey Wright",8,24 October 2019,"Finally got round to the review, just in time fo the dvd release!, but first why would anyone steal a painting from MOMA or anywhere? Director John Crowley waits to tell us at the end of The Goldfinch. Maybe to my advantage I haven't read The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt, although of course I remember it being published. In that respect I could enjoy the film as written, without constantly referring to the book. Ansel Elgort stars as Theo Decker in an Amsterdam hotel room with blood on his hands and a story to tell.Oakes Fegley plays the 13 year old Theo 8 years before, alone after his mother dies in a MOMA bomb blast and brought to Nicole Kidman's lovely Upper Eastside home. Her son Andy is a schoolfriend of Theo, and the Barbour family take him in. I never felt particular warmth from her Mrs Barbour, and it seemed an odd but noble thing to do for a relatively unknown friend. But helping him in his new room a ring drops out of the coat Mrs Barbour is folding. It's an heirloom Theo says, but really is the start of his journey.With a name passed to him in the aftermath of the bomb blast Theo finds his way to Hobart & Blackwell's antique shop, and Jeffrey Wright's partner Hobie. Just where he needs to be in a story that gently guides us towards the Pulitzer Prize finale. Such a beautiful and tactile environment with Hobie passing on his love of antiques, and their secrets to Theo. And this life long love combines with Theo's life long love of Pippa. Another casualty of the MOMA bomb blast, she lost her Uncle Welty Blackmore, and is convalescing with Hobie. It was Welty who gave Theo the ring.Theo's potential new life with the Barbours is interrupted with his reformed alcoholic father, (beer doesn't count), and step-mother's arrival. Luke Wilson and Sarah Paulson playing a great Roald Dahl style couple of guardians. How different Theo's life might have been with the Barbours. And I guess the charm of the ifs and buts of life in the story. But he is taken to a middle of repossessed nowhere Nevada home, not quite near enough the bright lights of Las Vegas. I loved Finn Wolfhard as the Ukrainian who takes him under his umbrella, and calls him Potter due to the glasses. Both boys do a terrific job enjoying a hard drinking, drug taking lifestyle without boundaries. And all the while hidden is Carel Fabritius's 1654 Goldfinch painting. And never once does Theo ever look at this painting he kept. Even when he finally leaves Las Vegas and finds his way back to New York.As an opiod addicted adult Ansel Elgort has learned his trade from Hobie, and after living with this kind man I wanted him to be someone quite different. But still hidden is that damn painting. I suppose you get to the point that it's too late to reveal it. But during an antique business meeting it seems that it may have surfaced in a drugs deal. Not quite as it's in a lock-up with Theo's drugs.But in a city of over 8 million people Theo happens to bump into the elder brother of his old friend Andy. Platt, played by Luke Kleintank, has turned out a lot better than I expected given his early interaction with his family. And Theo reconnects with the Barbours. Grieving themselves this time. Here I did feel warmth from Mrs Barbour who is excited to see him and wants Theo in their lives again. And he becomes engaged to daughter Kitsey, played by Willa Fitzgerald. Both in love with somebody else. Theo still with Pippa who chose to move to London to escape their history, as Ashleigh Cummings older Pippa explains to him. Sadly for such an important part of the story I didn't feel too involved in it.And amazingly in this large city when Theo goes to score drugs, he bumps into Boris. In another great casting Aneurin Barnard plays the grown-up friend who has a secret of his own. And something Theo never guessed over the years, but eventually leads them to the Amsterdam moments.I cannot fault John Crowley's direction, the casting was spot on and the cinematography by Roger Deakins was just beautiful. The reason for Theo taking the painting was not that big a secret after all. To save it and remind him of his Mum. Maybe that was why he never looked at it. But sad that he would carry so much guilt for that fateful day over the years. The book probably explored all these more thoroughly than the film could. But to see the hurt in Hobie's eyes when he hears the truth from Theo about the painting was especially heartbreaking. No explanations required.In the 2h 29min run time the movie kept me engaged, and the tidy ending is prized out of the rubble of what happened so long ago, and The Goldfinch gets to lives again. As well as a Rembrandt or two.Both the younger and older Theo and Boris actors were particularly good. And I'm particularly looking forward to West Side Story with Ansel Elgort after this and Baby Driver. And Jeffrey Wright was excellent as Hobie in a beautiful idea.",The Goldfinch

While it may not appeal to action fans in an age of superhero movies there is a good audience for a movie like this I think.The story revolves around a young man and takes you through his life, showing key moments bringing his own story to light. In a world filled with tragedy he has had his fair share but really the movie revolves around regret of actions past and a story of growth to rectify those.The acting is decent though Nicole Kidmans understated acting still shines above all others in this film. The story is moving and has a decent premise carefully crafted into a well told story. My only real gripe of any significance is that it is overly slow at points, particularly in the beginning. On the one hand some build up was needed to bring the audience slowly into a realization of the history but it felt overdone and could have done with a little trimming there in my opinion.Still though a decent film well worth a watch I would say.",The Goldfinch

80,mharah,"Same narrative, different story",7,1 October 2019,"The book is not the movie, the movie is not the book.The Goldfinch (Donna Tartt's novel) is a first-person narrative, one of the hardest pieces of prose to convert into film. The book is divided succinctly into two parts - young teenage Theo and mid-20s young adult Theo. The structure is linear, and the narrative is young adult Theo's reminiscence of his life's journey. We first see him in a Dutch hotel on Christmas Eve, seriously contemplating suicide. The book is 962 pages - some critics have described it as less than that but still long - not a treatise which lends itself readily to a 2-plus hour adaptation.The Goldfinch (the movie) is the same narrative, and it sticks very closely to the source. At 2 hours, 29 minutes, quite a lot had to be omitted. Thus, the movie became the same narrative, as told by a second-hand, third party raconteur - interested but recounting after the fact with input from young adult Theo and a few of his on-the-spot, in-the-moment, after-the-fact recollections. Although the narrative is the same, the story becomes very different from the book. In short, the film lacks the color that was so much a part of the novel.For viewers who read the book - especially those who loved it - the movie may disappoint. To say much more will constitute a spoiler. The production elements are impeccable. The screenplay suffers from the same problem as the novel - it is convoluted and too tightly packed - not a catastrophe but somewhat inexplicable. The performances are first-rate, but don't expect the characters to be exactly the same as the novel; there isn't enough time to develop that. Oakes Fegley (young Theo) is breathtaking he is so good. Finn Wolfhard creates an amazing teen Boris. His accent is consistent and quite believable. (Forget the accent critics; trying to understand authentic non-natives tackling American English is mostly unintelligible - not suitable for a movie.) Ansel Elgort (young adult Theo) gives an excellent grown-up version of himself. Supporting turns by Nicole Kidman, Luke Wilson, Jeffrey Wright, Sarah Paulson make it obvious why they are stars. (And except for Kidman, I probably wouldn't have envisioned any of them for the characters as portrayed in the book.)If you loved the book, you probably won't like the movie.

The whole storyline is shattered like a broken glass, editing seemed to be very difficult since there're so many details omitted due to a long and excessive words stacking up without end and purpose. Typical female writers' weakness in writing, too many and too much descriptions of the original novel, so when adapted into a movie, lot of details were omitted, that's why it needed the leading character to blabbering on the sideline to narrate. This is a very slow going deadbeat movie and its very suffocating. If you need a good time for reading, this is not a good book for you, so the movie, likewise, is not good either. Don't like the kid actor who played the young Theo. Actually, all the actors in this movie felt half dead due to a lousy script adapted from an overly unnecessarily long deadbeat story.

83,clairelouise5,A classy film version of the book.,8,31 December 2019,"The movie was very well done in bringing the book to life. I thought it told the story beautifully. The cast were great, I enjoyed Nicole Kidman's and Luke Wilson's characters in particular, as well as the New York setting. The only thing missing was that melancholic and seedy undercurrent of depression, drug abuse and sadness that haunts you in the book- the Amsterdam hotel scene nearly ruined me. Some of the quotes from the book were heartbreakingly beautiful, I thought there might be a narrative over some of the scenes as it would have packed a punch. It was primarily focused on the story of the actual painting but again, in the book, I found the painting storyline to be secondary to the mild despair of Theo and the unrequited love and tragedy of his life that eventually reaches it's crescendo in that hotel room. Still, I found it a very enjoyable watch.",The Goldfinch

I've never read the book and I understood the movie and the character relationships and the flow of events. I've come to realize that some people like an inane amount of detail to the books they read, I now a best seller that starts with twelve pages of the main character walking out the front door and another ""adult romance"" that hits page 97 before anything romantic happens.Bottom line if you can read between the lines you'll understand the importance of the relationships that form or end.

85,mc1382,Kinda Overhated,9,26 September 2019,"The Goldfinch is like a period piece on acid. What sells this is the story which is told in a straight forward fashion along with abstract elements that I really enjoyed. The film is a very intense challenging character study and had a lot of dark elements to it. The pacing definitely reflects Theos dark state of mind and appreciated that inclusion. Speaking of which, both young and old Theo did a good job. Don't know where the hate for Ansel is coming from.The other performances differ in quality but none took me out of the experience (Wolfhard as a Russian was so bizarre I couldn't hate it). The movie has it's flaws though. The pacing, plotting and characterization were inconsistent at points. Despite the muddled nature of the film's message and tone, I had a great time watching this.

You're better off just going to the museum to see the painting or Googling the painting.Theo Decker is fifty shades of screwed up. As a kid, his mother died in a bombing at the Met Museum. Theo barely survived but a dying old man encourages him to take the painting and old man's ring. He's sent to live at the Barbours, whose son, Andy, he is barely friends with. He searches for an antiques store to return the ring and to befriend the red-haired girl Pippa that was with old man at the time of bombing. Deadbeat dad shows up with white trash girlfriend to take Theo to Las Vegas with them. Theo befriends Boris, a Russian transplant with a knack for trouble and illegal substances. Deadbeat dad desperate for money tries to trick Theo into getting inheritance, but is blocked by family attorney, so deadbeat Dad kills himself, leaving Theo to run back to New York with Popper the dog, his late mother's emerald earrings, and what he thinks is the painting but is actually a textbook that Boris switched the painting with (Theo doesn't find out about the switcheroo till years later). Theo heads to antiques place and grows up to work at antique shop but his work life and personal life are a mess. He's a full blown addict, he's engaged to a woman he doesn't love (the late Andy's little sister Kitsey, whose also cheating on Theo), is in love with Pippa (whose engaged to a Brit), and is blackmailed by a customer for selling him a fake antique. Enter grown up Boris, a boring engagement party with Kitsey NOT wearing the emerald earrings, a trip to Amsterdam, an art deal gone horribly wrong, a murder, an overdose, and you are soooooo exhausted at this point that you wish they'd wrap it up already and when they do, it's just WTF was that?!?!? We don't know if Theo finally ends things with Kitsey nor do we find out if he makes amends with Pippa nor do we find out if he gets his life in order. Nope, we just get Theo returning to the store, walking with Mrs. Harbour, and MORE flashbacks to the friggin museum before the bombing. After two and a half hours, I expected a better ending than THIS.The book is waaay too long with too little chapters and in need of an editor. The movie is no better either. There's no character development, a protagonist that's basically a walking mumbling mess in need of therapy (and rehab), too many characters to keep track of, and too many storylines to follow. The movie and the book don't know what it wants to be. One minute it wants to be a coming of age film, the next a straight up drama, then a coming of age film again, then an art history lesson, then a mystery, then a crime drama, then a dark addiction drama, etc. Pick a genre and stick with it! The actors do their best and is beautifully filmed, but at the end of the day, you're better off going to your local art museum and enjoy the works of art in person. This film (and the book) will just leave you frustrated. I've never read Donna Tartt's previous books, and I think it'll stay that way.",The Goldfinch

Only a last act left turn into conventional thriller territory fails to convince in what is otherwise a highly impressive chunk of high-brow literary Oscar bait. The calamitous catalyst in Crowley's saga is a bomb explosion at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art that robs 13-year-old Theo Decker (Fegley) of his mother. Yet it also unites him with a priceless painting - the Goldfinch of the title - that becomes his talisman during the resulting rite of passage, which sees him taken in by a Manhattan grande dame (Nicole Kidman), whisked off to Nevada by his deadbeat gambler pops (Luke Wilson) and befriended by a Ukrainian punk with links to the Russian mafia (Stranger Things' Finn Wolfhard).

99,sherylchilders82,Cerebral movie about how people make decisions to survive in life,7,16 September 2019,"***SPOILERS***Ultimately, this is about mortality and the people we connect with (and lose) in our lifetime. But, it's also about struggling to survive, and why people do the things that they do. In particular, it focuses on bad decisions done apparently for naive and genuine reasons. Stealing the painting for a dying man's wish with an acute brain injury? Because it was his Mom's favorite. As complicated as the story is, it's really as simple as that.A touch too nostalgic for me (I wasn't even sure the time period until the girl brought out an old iPod). There is a subtle reference to 9/11. The bombing takes place in New York. Later, in the desert on the TV, you can see the World Trade Center towers still standing. Then, a flashback after the museum blast with characteristic ash settling and a pair of shoes in the mostly crumbled rubble. This maybe was an attempt to reference a shared traumatic experience for many people. Particularly touching was the bonding between the main character and his temporary caregiver, played by Kidman. There is a strong message of the idea of fate, that things happen for a reason. This of course is not an original theme, but it feels fresh and ok here, since things are not like a fairy tale.But, it was troubling to me that drug addiction and murder were minor problems, or harmless adolescent activities. This felt unrealistic and fantastical. A big time Russian drug dealer with a lifelong goal of getting back something he stole from a childhood friend? Because that type of person in real life doesn't really have a conscience, and even if they do - a childhood mistake would be buried in a lifetime of bad decisions that hurt others (even if he did love him as implied).Also, despite being a lifelong addict, the main actor seems healthy and socially stable, too. We're supposed to believe that he is really a good guy despite his selfish behavior. And what is the point of the unfaithful fiancé to the story? Why is he better than her? We are supposed to believe that stealing the painting (with innocent intentions) leads to a lifetime of mistakes, but each decision is made alone, not dependent on others. So, he chooses his life, especially once he is an adult. I feel like we're supposed to feel affected by this character, but I found him annoying and entitled. This type of stoic male character is not just unbelievable, but also old fashioned.I think an older generation will appreciate this, even though there are quite a few awkward and controversial scenes, but the mood felt unrealistic to me. However, the combination of controversial subjects with the nostalgic feel made this a unique watch. And despite being long, I never felt bored.",The Goldfinch

Although The Goldfinch book which won the Pulitzer Prize, was beautifully written I am in the camp of those who say at almost 800 pages it was far too long. Can a masterpiece of fictional literature be too long? IMO, yes it can.
The movie wasn't short, at 2 1/2 hours and it did a good job eliminating a lot of the parts that the book should have. For example the book dedicated way too many chapters to Theo and Boris partying and growing up. Also, the ending of the book where Boris and Theo go after the painting is exciting but again just far too long. The movie does a good job of editing what the book should have.

I expected an indie film journey and something mimicking the trailer, both were mistaken. This is a dark movie, it took a sleep to appreciate its subtleties. The film is about the lead characters fall from a solid family foundation. It pulls him into a downward spiral that includes drug abuse, fraud and deception. The titles artwork carries another storyline deeply intertwined with the first but presents a premise that art stewardship lives beyond our own mortality and needs to be protected. Finn Wolfhard does a good job of his role, the leads ambassador to the dark side, the leads nemesis and his own unique play of a physically abused kid just trying to survive his dark reality whatever way he can. Personally I prefer a storyline where characters are more in control, you are presented this tale as a kid who loses mom and then behaves erratically to keep her alive by his stealing the artwork. Expecting that evolutionary tale it swings wide and leads the audience stumbling to piece it together. A web of happenstance meetings between characters moves things along but you can't help but feel the main is a passenger along for the ride. It's a brooding long story, it's a little contrived with coincidence but life can be that way.

120,Mengedegna,"No, the critics were right. Alas.",4,15 September 2019,"Many of the commenters here and elsewhere have been saying things like ""Ignore the critics - it's a great film"", and I went hoping that they would be proven right.Alas, despite some fine acting from a few members of the cast (both Nicole Kidman and Sarah Paulson are excellent), the film cannot be recommended to those who, like me, were infatuated by the Donna Tart's novel. This seems to be due to the inherent tension between the screenplay's slavishly literal fidelity to the text, on the one hand, and to the choices it does makes (inevitably, given the book's sprawl), on the other.Where it diverges from the novel, it does so in big and, I think, quite damaging ways (damaging, that is, to a film that presumably seeks to elicit the kind of intense involvement from its viewers that the book demanded from readers). One of these is the episodic, almost random way in which so many sequences seem to have been sliced, diced and glued back together in what seems to be no particular order. Too many of these sequences appear to be perfunctory -- brief exchanges of dialogue that serve only to fill in the backstory or to advance the plot line (assuming, under these circumstances that you can keep track of it), without any deeper meaning being conveyed by the acting or the cinematography. Much of the film thus plays like an extended trailer, edited to achieve specific effects without emotional or character-driven context.
Even more damaging is the decision to portray the protagonist, Young Theo Decker, as younger than he is depicted in the book, in such a way that the Young Theo sequences are drained of much of their original meaning. In the book, Theo is portrayed as pubescent, and we are witnesses not just to events that he undergoes more or less passively, but to his sexual and emotional maturation. Oakes Fegley, the actor in question (who is not without talent - one could imagine him evolving into something along the lines of a Philip Seymour Hoffman), appears to be about that age, but, as is usual in American movies, the child he portrays is clearly meant to be younger. This unbalances and denatures his crucial relationship with Boris, the worldly-wise and thrillingly dangerous Ukrainian friend he meets in high school while exiled from New York to the outer fringes of Las Vegas. In the book, they are high schoolers; in the film, they appear to be more like middle schoolers, which distorts a lot of what is supposed to be going on. The film apparently got an R rating for its pervasive depictions of drug use and its brief episode of violence, but this is one of the ways in which, unlike the book, it stays far too safely - damagingly so - in PG-13 territory.The leap from Young Theo to Young-Adult Theo (i.e, from Fegley to Ansel Elgort) is thus too abrupt to fit the story's time-scale. And, if it was the production team's intention to portray Young-Adult Theo as a twit (which, in retrospect, is a plausible reading of the book, though not mine), it succeeded beyond its wildest expectations. As a result, Elgort's all-too-transparently artificial emoting in the climaxes misses the mark - they never feel genuine and are, in some cases, downright embarrassing. A central character in a stem winder like this should, at the very least, have some charisma, but Elgort seems to have been told (and been costumed and bespectacled) to cool things down. Cooling seems to be the overall point, and it follows that the movie departs from the book in lacking heat.Finally, a loud raspberry for the two Borises, Finn Wolfhard as Young Boris and Aneurin Barnard as the adult version. Both clearly had to expend a lot of effort on maintaining their would-be Slavic accents (which nonetheless slip in and out), to the detriment of their actual acting. No Russian or Ukrainian viewing this film is likely to believe in either character for one moment. This is customary in Hollywood, where the belief seems, absurdly, to be that dialect coaches can turn any actor into a credible linguistic clone. Far better to recruit genuine, in this case, Slavic actors (of whom there are plenty) and put the coaching resources into coaxing them into English intelligibility.All these elements mean that I felt none of the involvement that had kept me glued to the book. Just as the critics had warned me.",The Goldfinch

I enjoyed every second of it even though some of them were kind of painful.

The Goldfinch is an amazing unpredictable well written movie which had me interested the entire time. There were no filler scenes like when a song plays and a character stares at the ocean or a sunset. The story constantly added layers to the characters and they would reappear throughout the movie which is refreshing and unusual in today's offerings.Note: Not dissing The Blindside!

The cinematography was great as well as the directing, Oakes Fegley is a star in the making and this is his movie. The remaining cast was pretty good and Finn Wolfhard, despite what critics are saying, nails the Russian accent. This movie represents life and how just one mistake can change your future drastically and it's not a movie for casual film-goers (as I thought 10 minutes could have been trimmed).

Where was the dialogue ( had they forgotten to write some for some scenes)? Where was the fizz that the editor is supposed to add?

Several story threads in the movie could have been deleted without in any way negatively affecting the outcome. And there were a couple of continuity problems that really stood out that anyone who is thinking will find frustrating to see. Those faults might lie with the editor.

I saw that critics were very harsh with it, but I can't understand why. It's a phenomenal, beautifully done movie. The acting, by the young Theo (Oakes Fegley) was breathtaking. He is a natural if there ever was one. I will admit this movie was very triggering for me, without getting into the plot, because a lot of what happened to Theo happened to me, so it was tough from that standpoint, but I also have first hand experience that it was played, and written, extremely well. My heart ached for him, at many points in the movie. I do wish that drug abuse wasn't as prevalent a part of the movie as it was, but considering what he went through it's understandable. Sarah Paulson did a great job with the woman you love to hate, and I adored Ansel Elgort as the grown Theo!! He too was an amazing actor, who was able to convey a ton of emotions through just a look. The way that the film seamlessly wove the young and old Theo's together, and tantalizingly provided glimpses of how the past affects the future, was top notch. Please see this movie for yourself! It is well worth it, and in my opinion should be an Academy Award contender!",The Goldfinch

The plot of This film centred around a bomb explosion in a world-famous art gallery in New York (how they ever got permission to use their name was poor judgment on their part). You then had seven different stories unfold (this was nine stories too many) One story involved an orphaned boy whose mother had been killed in the explosion, who had been given inside the gallery a valuable oil painting by a dying man laid dying on the art gallery museum floor. or he had stolen it (how a bomb injured man would be able to remove this painting from the wall undamaged by the bomb and hold on to it, during and after the terrorist explosion was never explained - he died without ever explaining how it was done?) In this film we met at least four characters who were never introduced and all eight added nothing to the film or story, there was no art forgery, no artist at work, no wheeling and dealing, a Russian mystery kid showed up as the orphan's sidekick, a shootout in Amsterdam occurred leaving 2 or 3 dead but no Police appeared, then we had a botched suicide, it was awful.

These people make up the wonderfully portrayed characters in this film who shape the young man he becomes.Theo's grief is inconsolable, partly because he blames himself, and his only comfort is a package wrapped in a blanket that in it's softness over bone-like hardness is the physical as well as emotional connection with his lost loved one.His world goes from a privileged life in New York, to having to steal and cook his own food in California, to a career that uses his artistic eye for detail and a soul still struggling to find the sense of belonging he lost.Truly absorbing and moving.",The Goldfinch

Most of the reviews here are from folks who have read there book... which is cool, but I prefer a movie that is good no matter whether you read the source material or not. This isn't that movie.The acting was very good. But the chopped, convoluted plot made no sense, back and forth with no rhyme or reason. And dragged on about an hour longer than needed to make the point. A previous reviewer hit the nail on the head: you're left wondering how long until the end, begging for some sort of ending, anything to escape.Otherwise, the sound is muddled and everyone mumbles their lines... use your closed captions in order to better understand the dialog.Do yourself a favor and skip it.

Finn Wolfhard who played young Boris excelled in his performance and nailed his Russian accent. There was also strong backing performances from Kidman, Wilson, Paulson and Wright.

165,Roevivium,The Goldfinch is a masterpiece... which sadly doesn't translate well into film.,4,18 May 2020,"Donna Tartt's Goldfinch has sat on my bookshelf for a number of years, and I have even been known to call it one of my favourites. When I heard there was a film coming out, I was initially excited, then remembered the demise of similar beloved novels (The Time Traveller's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger; Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn) into abridged motion picture.That aside, I think if I watched this film without prior knowledge of the book, I would have found it fairly dull and unremarkable. The Russian accent attempted by both actors playing Boris (Finn Wolfhard and Aneurin Barnard) lent an unfortunate bathos to moments which were intended to pull at the heartstrings of the audience. The characters lack depth; the deaths seem sudden, and without any real attachment to the characters, it had little emotional impact. Whilst I can't fault Sarah Paulson's acting, I feel she was miscast for Xandra - Paulson seems a little too sophisticated here for a bar owner/gambling addict/druggie.As has been mentioned in previous reviews, the structure of the film is confusing. It jumps around the timeline of Theo's life, perhaps with the intention of cutting out some of the longer elements of the story which the writers chose not to include. All in all, I finished the movie feeling deeply unsatisfied and a little sad - perhaps it's time to go back to reading again.",The Goldfinch

I was so surprised to see Sarah Paulson. Essentially, the movie is about Theodore, a boy who is struggling with severe trauma. His mom dies in a museum fire and he feels as though it's his fault. When his mom died he was not in the same room, but in the room over. He was looking at a goldfinch painting, and he steals it. This painting is worth tons of money and will be a huge hassle for the rest of his life. He moves in with an old friends family, but eventually moves in with his father (who left his mother a while before she died.) his father is now in a relationship with a woman named Xandra(which is kind of a confusing character, so that takes one point away) He meets a boy named Boris at school and they become fast friends. Boris is effectively a 13/14 year old drug addict with an abusive father. Boris and Theodore are debatably in love with one another and there is a TON of ignored tension there. I do wish the movie/book would end with them getting together. But, alas it did not. Boris steals the painting from him and eventually Theodore goes back to New York. I have watched this movie 4 times and I love it but don't 100% understand the ending. Will have to watch it more or read the book, I guess.",The Goldfinch

It felt like the film-makers spent way too long trying to turn the story into a ""Gatsby"", or ""Talented Mr Ripley"".But this story was supposed to be about a painting and this painting didn't feature enough in the long-meandering journey for the payoff at the end.",The Goldfinch

On that same page it also described the bad reviews and weak box office the movie generated. But based on the synopsis, even with the spoilers, I decided to watch the movie and was not disappointed.

It's unfortunate that this movie did not do well in theaters as it is definitely worth seeing and stands on its own. And I am more motivated to read the book now.",The Goldfinch
175,azeemsaw,critic's are wrong,9,9 September 2019,"Movie is so good with amazing cinematography, music, acting especially young Boris(Finn wolfhard) the kid really give amazing performance , while the other things are also great , the production value is amazing too.

176,ababuso,Repeat after me....,2,22 May 2020,"Slow. SLOW. S.L.O.W. Two and a half hours of....""character development?"" Not even. If I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have had any idea what was going on; as it was I had to explain it to my partner throughout. What is wrong with writing a straightforward adaptation? The actual story is deep enough - all the back and forth mish-mash was tedious torture. Don't kill the actors, kill the screenplay!",The Goldfinch
177,kevsilverr2000,Stick with the book....don't waste your time on the movie,1,26 November 2019,What a colossal waste of time. I voraciously read the book. It was a masterpiece in storytelling and character development. I couldn't put it down. Best book I've read in years. The movie is a total disaster. Awful acting all around aside from Nicole Kidman (Mrs. Barbour) and Jeffrey Wright (Hobie). The young and adult versions of Theo were painful to watch. Theo's childhood in Las Vegas is an amazing part of the book but it's reduced to about ten minutes of confusion in the movie. It is hard to find two young actors who can accurately portray alcoholic druggies and the actors who played Theo and Boris failed miserably. I just didn't believe their close bond at all. If I hadn't read the book I would have been totally confused by this whole movie. Scenes just thrown together. Great scenes left out entirely. I was really looking forward to the movie and am so disappointed with the result. Better direction and a better lead actor could have made all the difference.,The Goldfinch

180,hankyank,Cinematic poetry.,9,26 November 2019,"Unexpected beautiful. Like with beauty it is hard to find words. Words somehow trim down on beauty.As with art we don't need to understand we just need to feel. Experience.The slow metronome pace of the movie. Slow but intense.The kaleidoscopic world. Richness and poverty. Addiction and control. Abuse and love. As life is in a grandiose scale.We will never grasp reality as we are meaninggiving animals. We lay a fantasy over the moving atoms that constructs reality.It makes us doubt what is what. Good or bad. Love or hate. What is real love? The rational between man and woman. Or the frienship between master and pupil.The betrayal that is always there. And will always be there.It reminds me of the Russian writers like Tolstoj and Dostojevski. Where we find consolation in the human extistence. The impossibility to control happiness. The randomness.It displays a deep love of life. Love. Our human incapacity. The poetic quality of memory. The visual spectacle if we dare to see.The discussion on the this movie shows the schism. We desire simplicity as humans. The complexity and ungraspability makes us feel uncomfortable. Nervous. We want to get out. Of the movie. Or the characters in life. It is essentially the same.Thanks for making this movie, at least you touched me.",The Goldfinch
181,xjamesourownx,Needed an extra half hour,6,23 November 2019,The Goldfinch was quite a special book full of atmosphere and suspense as well of coming of age. Its also a bloody big book so to make it work in a short film is quite difficult.That is the movies let down. The development of characters that is expansive in the book was lacking the space they needed in the film. Its still a decent enough flick but you just don't get drawn into the emotion of the people involved.,The Goldfinch
182,CarlosPintoLeite,The Shape of Future,10,12 September 2019,"What I found more fascinating in this story is how the main characters evolve and are molded, not so much by circumstances but by relatives, friends and other people that enter and leave their lives. And we all can relate with this. How different would our lives be if we had been born in another family, if our parents didn't get divorced and then someone else had not come to fill the void? If we hadn't been taught as young by an inspiring teacher or if we had met true friends to give us a piece of wisdom when most needed? In fact, each character in this story, as in real life, plays a part In redirecting and molding the path of life of the main characters. But ultimately it's our past and present choices that shape our future. Our choices have consequences. What happened for a naive kid to grow into a broken adult? What happened to us? The actors do succeed in getting us in their skin. And there's an irreprehensible Nicole Kidman. But even if she wasn't there, the movie would make its way anyway.",The Goldfinch

186,gogolooks,Lack of character development; this should have been a masterpiece,6,15 September 2019,"I loved the book like everyone else who went to the movies with the expectations of a great movie. Unfortunately, however much I wanted to love the movie, I did not. I also don't hate it either. I may have enjoyed the movie a lot more had I never read the book, but expectations fell low. First, the chronology of the film is not linear, so we do jump around the timelines, which is pretty cool. But this also caused the great distress for not getting to know the characters well enough before we developed any feelings for them or their connections to Theo. Some spoilers ahead. We know Theo's mom does right in the beginning, but the way she is revealed at the end is too late for us to know that relationship Theo ever had with her or the way the room was left unchanged when he decided to run home and wait for his mother. That sense of loss was, well, lost in itself for not allowing us to connect with her earlier on. I couldn't care more for the mom for as much as I should be. Each character felt brushed by. I felt I was introduced to the dad and not much about him made me feel anything for him, neither when he died, he tried to cheat Theo or anything. Mrs. Barbour is a character that would have maybe saved at least one of the whole charActer relationships in the film, but because of the timeline, we see Mrs. Barbour say goodbye to Theo on his way to Vegas, and ten minutes later we are out of Vegas and back in nyc 8 years later, seeing Mrs. Barbour. There was no sense of missing her because we go right back to her. So many scenes that could have played out in a more important manner and conveying emotions were lost. Puppy was developed ok, but I wished a slight more was seen. Her last scene with Theo at the pub was the most emotional connection out of all the other characters, but again it was shortsighted. Hobie didn't do much, but just dipped in and out of Theo's life.Little details were missing. I finished the book two days before the movie came out. One big scene that jumped out was Kitsey not wearing the green emerald earrings that she was supposed to wear in the book. Perhaps this decision was made becuase her character wasn't much in the film.
That said, the cinematography was astounding. The cast was great and this would and should have been a great maybe tv series rather than jamming a whole 600 paged storyline scenes into a two and a half hour film. The climax built greatly, but fell off pace as it felt rushed.
This would have been great.i still enjoyed the movie, even though I was hoping for a lot more.",The Goldfinch

I could feel quite well the diversity of the personalities in the movie whether it'd be Theo himself or Boris, his friend, or, for example, Xandra (Sarah Paulsen). I know it's an adaptation, and I am still to read the Donna Tartt's book. The goldfinch, a bird, symbolizes abundance, happiness and joy. And Theo did feel happy just preserving the 17th-century painting of a chained goldfinch (what a metaphor!!) that he'd happened to rescue during the explosion at the MOMA. Also, the idea that sometimes it's about playing a poor hand well that matters; or rather the idea that to achieve something big, something great or important, you might do something bad, was not at all new to me but, in this context, it did strike my mind.",The Goldfinch

The child and adult actors were perfect choices, and all gave phenomenal performances.

I feel like they skimmed over it too quickly.The whole idea of the painting and it getting away was lost to me. Not sure if we are supposed to feel bad or route for Theo but I could care less.Didn't see the depth and proufoundess the movie was trying to portray. Even so, the movie could have easily made things a bit more dramatically to fit in an 1 hr 130 vs 2 1/2 hours. Most movies over 2 hrs better have compelling stories and action to keep the viewer. I think we knew the ending before it happened and knew the direction even before the middle of the film. Underwhelming ending to say the least.Besides the boring plot and long running time, the acting and cinematography was good. Music was nice but I'm kinda picky when it comes to music placement.

I fear people will see this movie and find it boring or pointless but I highly encourage you to read the book or even look up quotes from it because her writing is beautiful! And it was really missing from this film.

230,carakinnick,This Movie Was Made for the Fans. Wolfhard & Barnard Shine.,10,16 September 2019,"I have been a fan of both Ansel Elgort and Finn Wolfhard for many years. When it was announced in January 2018 that these two brilliant young actors would be filming a movie together, I was over the moon. I picked up a copy of The Goldfinch shortly after the announcement and began reading the novel. If I'm being honest, it was not the easiest read, as I am not a person who is well versed in the world of fine arts and antiques. It took me a while to get through it, but in the end, it was a truly rich, moving and beautiful story that I fell in love with.Having very tragically lost a parent at a young age myself, I felt an immediate connection and protectiveness of young Theo. This emotion translated from page to screen beautifully through Oakes Fegley's performance. He was able to perfectly emote the pain and fear that Theo was experiencing after the loss of his mother and the theft of the painting. He did a fantastic job and his character was 100% believable.Finn Wolfhard stole the whole show for me. Boris was by far my favorite character in the book, so naturally, he was my favorite character in the film as well. He was such a breath of fresh air and unlike any other person that Theo had ever met in his life. He didn't care about art or antiques. The painting to him was simply ""Theo's picture"" and that was that. What you see is what you get with him. Boris was such a different role for Finn; he was the type of character I had never seen him perform before and I think that he nailed it right on the head. From his accent to every line, quirk and mannerism, he exceeded my expectations. He was the comic relief and he was the heart. His performance was truly brilliant and believe me, this is not the last we've heard of him.I went to see the movie expecting it to focus around Ansel Elgort and Aneurin Barnard who were both wonderful in their own rights, but really, this movie belonged to Oakes and Finn. As I mentioned before, I've been a fan of Ansel for many years, but Anerin's portrayal of adult Boris really blew me away and I wish we had seen a bit more of him in the film. I picked up the book in the first place for Ansel and Finn, but it was Finn and Aneurin who left the greatest impression on me while watching the film.I also want to note that Nicole Kidman, perhaps the most seasoned actor in this film, brought a warmth to Mrs. Barbour that I didn't quite feel in the book. She was simply amazing, and while young Theo in both the book and in the movie might have felt that she was stand-offish in regards to him, I could clearly see through Nicole's performance that Mrs. Barbour always very deeply cared for Theo.This was truly a movie for the fans. There are certain fine details about adult Theo's life that are left grossly unexplained in the film which I'm sure could be confusing for the average audience member who hasn't read the book, such as Theo's relationships with Lucius Reeve and Kitsey Barbour and how they came to be. And more. That being said, everything that I cared about, deemed important, or could have possibly wanted from the book was included in the film. As a fan, I was left completely satisfied with The Goldfinch and it's such a shame that more people didn't give it a chance.I don't think the critics were right. But perhaps I'm biased.",The Goldfinch
231,endphen,Disgusting,1,12 May 2020,"Prepare yourself every ""man"" in this movie is the worst kind of toxic masculinity imaginable.

I saw it with a friend who hasn't read the novel, and he really enjoyed it too. I highly suggest you give it a shot and form your own opinion.

233,miles_coombe,Before and After,4,11 July 2020,"I first watched this film before reading the book and scored it a 7, which is perfectly respectable I suppose. Then I read the book and discovered that they left out everything that made the book truly incredible. Indeed, Theo's tortured internal monologue is almost the entire point of the book, and so without this the film is almost pointless. I ended up at a 4 because there are some redeeming things about this film, but really it pales into nothing if you actually know the world that is created within the book. I urge you just to go and read it. You will not be disappointed.",The Goldfinch

237,nadia-36885,Critics are wrong,10,13 September 2019,"The performances were amazing, the cinematography was breathtaking, but the plot was a bit of a mess. They could've made flashbacks from old Theo to young Theo and that would be fine but the other way just didn't make sense to me. Amsterdam went by way too fast and it wasn't that enjoyable considering that it was my favorite part of the book. Biggest mistake of the film is that they do not show the actual explosion until the end of the movie. I think for the most part the movie was great, a bit pacing at times, but that's just how the book is. It had the books feel to me and that's all that i was hoping for.",The Goldfinch
238,leighanntobia,Superb Acting -- Unjust Adaptation,10,6 October 2019,"Watch this film for Oakes, Finn, Ansel, and Aneurin. Their performances are stunning.The film is frustrating because it is so short. 700+ pages cannot be consolidated into 2.5 hours. It can't be. The structure of the movie is in flashbacks, out of order-- this is jarring, taking me out of emotional moments. A lot of time is spent on the first part of Theo's life, making his adulthood feel rushed, which also took me out of the film.",The Goldfinch

It is hard to understand why this is receiving poor reviews; all I can think is that for those who did not read the book the plot could appear convoluted. It is a complicated story line that spreads out over decades. The three of us who saw this film did read the book first, and loved this movie.

The movie did not disappoint, it told the story the way the book did, left me on the edge of my seat even when I knew spoilers, and moved me. It's not told in chronological order like most films, and can get confusing if not paid close attention to detail. The movie follows the structure and storytelling of the book VERY closely, which can be satisfying for book readers and annoying to general audience. Overall I left the theater feeling satisfied being able to see my favorite story brought to life. Ansel Elgort, Luke Wilson, and Nicole Kidman did an exceptional job.",The Goldfinch

We were waiting for every character to appear on a screen, every single moment from book to happen. There were disappointments of course, as some dialogs and actions in the movie didn't actually happen or were different in the book, however, the overall feeling is positive.

This is a cheaply written, dollar store version of Donna Tartt's prizewinning novel, The Goldfinch. Completely missed the mark.Poor casting, hollow dialogue, distinct lack of chemistry between characters and poorly stitched together time leaps leave the audience confused and bored. Cinematography is often boring and predictable. The film is an absolute fiasco of rushed plot points and long scenes of embarrassingly unconvincing acting.Save your evening, read the book instead.",The Goldfinch

I saw reviews and bought the novel. A part of me is scared to read the novel and ruin the film. I thought it was interesting from beginning to end and while some feel it was all over the place, I personally liked the flash backs and flash forwards. I don't think they could have picked a better set of actors..I consider it a masterpiece but perhaps now that I know there's a novel and have it maybe I'll read it and return with a different opinion.

260,bodidly,"Great actors, disappointing script",5,26 January 2020,"The book, the Pulitzer winning novel by Donna Tartt, read like a movie, unfolding subtly, painting complex picture of life after a tragedy with just a hint of a crime in its background (yet enough of a hint to make one involved). Now, I have no idea by whose decision the script cut up the original plot into juxtaposed pieces, severing the intricate human avatars in the process and making a mess out of a perfectly composed, complex plot. Great acting, great actors and a disappointingly flat movie far from the exquisite original story. Wish, they didn't toy with what already was perfect.",The Goldfinch

265,maxfieldmaterne,"Too much ""and then this"" happening here",3,14 June 2021,"The story is told in a way that recounts events rather than cause and effect, interruption, and tension. What I mean, is that everything just happens in this movie. It's one event after another. Events are loosely tied together but rarely come together into a cohesive story line. It's rushed, and the ending especially suffers from this, hurrying to meet it's meaning rather than taking time to let it sink in, or marinate. I think this is wholly because of the previous 2:15 hours being rushed, losing the core thread of the story.As a reader of the book: I have read plenty of books that have been adapted successfully into movies and I often REALLY like them. They give an alternate face to a favorite character, visuals I hadn't imagined, it's usually a delight to compare versions. Unfortunately, this felt like it focused on too many elements of the story, rather than distilling it down into the key moments, the core themes, the important relationships. It tries to do too much.",The Goldfinch

I expected action but even the scene when Theo kills Martin is boring. The character of Boris is not showed as it should be.I know it's hard to adapt a film from more than 700-page novel but in some cases they have lost connectiona between the scenes. It's confusing what happened to Larry and who is Jerome, and so on.This film is my disappointment of the year.",The Goldfinch

There were parts cut from the book but it's like a 900 pg book so that's understandable. I wish it would have ended with Theo righting his wrongs because it seem like such an important part to his character. But I love how it ended with the moment that seemed to start the whole story in the first place, when Theo first saw the painting with his mom.",The Goldfinch
273,beverly_bolender,Beyond my expectations,10,14 September 2019,"Where do I start? All of the characters were amazing and so wonderfully written. Although the book was so much more detailed at 770+ pages, the movie did its best to bring it full circle. Both the main character Theo and his friend Boris had such messed up childhoods, and still they both found strength in each other. I loved their relationship as they both struggled for love. This movie is like none other, full of twists you cannot imagine. Nicole Kidman played her role perfectly, and so did all 4 actors playing the younger and older versions of Theo and Boris. Jeffrey Wright is especially memorable in this film as Hobie. Having just finished the book before seeing the film, I was very pleased with the adaptation.",The Goldfinch

But even before I saw the titular painting the film got me hooked. By showing little snippets of what is to come, it got me thinking about how the story will unfold. The plot was well-paced, the twist unexpected. There are slim chances that it could realistically happen, nevertheless, they exist. The cast is superb, no complaints there. They showed some real emotions, that got me to write this review in the first place. The only thing that could have bothered me was the slightly weak Russian accent. But it didn't. What did bother me was the criticism that I fail to understand, sure there exist films that barely pass the bar of mediocracy, but this one sure wasn't one of them.Conclusion: An excellent film, an excellent cure for a rainy/snowy day.",The Goldfinch

The biggest problem was that the film felt so disjointed with all the flash forwards and flash backwards.
The older Theo storyline for me was also the aspect of the film I was least interested in.
I was left wanting more of Young Theo and Young Boris and their time in Vegas.
What was reduced to what felt like barely 10 minutes could've lasted an hour or more and would have been SO much more enjoyable.I also agree with a another reviewer who wrote about the better medium to tell a story like this would've have been as a mini series or full tv adaptation.Shame.6/10 for me...and that's me being generous.",The Goldfinch
281,akngvn,Slow paced good drama,8,19 October 2020,"I think what makes this film a good film are a couple things, I'd start with atmosphere of the film firstly, the camera was used very good, cuts are awesome and the places it was filmed in are also good. I decided to watch this film after seeing its trailer which consisted a song from The National, sadly the song isn't in the film :(. Secondly the acting of the head actor is very well, this adds up to the atmosphere and to the story and creates a very good film. It is a long and slow paced film, we see both the childhood and younghood of the main character but this also makes the watcher dive deeper into the story rather than boring them. Family, the struggles of some kid who has family problems, Love, the struggles of some hurt child's love affairs and kind of a disability to express his emotions due to his past life are shown very well in the film. Overall it's a touching story and the filming locations and methods are awesome so I like the film and would suggest it.",The Goldfinch

Their performances were outstanding especially the last two scenes prior to Theo leaving Las Vegas.

288,Ajaxon0000,A young mans quest of purpose and coincidence.,7,1 June 2020,"This film really reaches out and shows the power of choices and how we (the audience) can think back to the events and decisions that shaped who we are today. More importantly, we are not always in control.The relationships we build, whether bad/good, can always come back and can save us or hurt us. And I feel like that was a reoccurring theme throughout the film. Even though there was many back and forth between points in his history - I never felt myself lost or confused on what point we were placed at in his past. However, the movie does go slow in some parts that I felt could have been cut. Seems like they start to lose you a little bit, but I did get pulled back.I think the performance by Jeffrey Wright was incredible. The guy can be so warm/inviting, but also really ominous at the same time. While watching him learn the news of the stolen painting, you can help but get that feeling of letting someone down that you never want to disappoint. All you can think of is how to right the situation.I know this movie, is hit or miss for most.

When I saw the movie today I was so badly disappointed that I couldn't resist writing a review.
A few points.
1.WHATS WITH THE IRRELEVANT CHARACTERS that go absolutely nowhere have no relevance to the story.
2. No emotional connection with the Barbours OR with the painting
3. Zero sense of storyline, very hard to follow as you are distracted with irrelevant characters, and story lines that end with no explanation?Disgusting editing and the book could of been adapted way better rather than literally translating every page.

292,sunilpanikker-67851,An unbelievably bad screenplay!,3,29 May 2020,"If you haven't read the book this movie is going to make very little sense to you as it trudges along for 149 minutes. For almost the first hour of the movie the viewer has no idea what the protagonist, Theo Decker is so traumatized about.
Unfortunately the screenplay seems to have been written with the presumption that the audience has read the book.
Jumping back an forth with snippets of a dust filled room is very confusing, just as much as the moving back and forth between old and young Theo.
The movie tediously drags along under labourious direction by Crowley, to finally breath it's last at an insipidly assembled ending, in contrast to the exciting climax of the book.
The book was enthralling. The movie is just as disappointing.

The movie missed the philosophy part. That was sad.When I heard The Goldfinch would become a movie, I was somewhat perplexed. The book is long. I thought it would have been a great Amazon / Netflix 10-part series. There was just too much to chew to make a meaningful movie.That said, I loved Luke Wilson, Sarah Paulson, Nicole Kidman and Jeffrey Wright. Also, both incarnations of Theo and Boris. I wished we would have seen more of Andy Barbour.The movie missed the luminosity of Audrey Barbour. That left a big void.At the end of 2.5 hours, I wondered if the movie would have been watchable if I hadn't known the story. If nothing else, I'm inspired to listen to the book again. The audio book is remarkable.",The Goldfinch

The book is incredible, obviously, and yeah the movie could've been a little more accurate to the story but I really enjoyed it! A lot of the stuff left out doesn't ruin the story without it and a lot of the stuff added in allows the plot to flow easier in a screen setting. It was also really beautifully shot! Just visually this is a great film. And the cast is incredible. Go see this movie in theatres because it is truly lovely, heart warming, and sometimes gut wrenching. So much love for The Goldfinch!!",The Goldfinch
