0,TheLittleSongbird,"The production values dazzle, the film overall disappoints massively",4,14 May 2017,"Expectations for 'The Tourist' were not particularly high. Despite having a talented cast, experienced writers (including talented Julian Fellowes) and a far from amateurish director, that it was negatively received by most critics and often cited one of the worst films of its year was a turn off.Seeing it for myself, as any film, good or bad and regardless of its genre, deserves, 'The Tourist' to me was nowhere near as bad as reputed. As far as films from 2010 go, there are far worse which are not worth mentioning. However, 'The Tourist', considering the talent on and off screen, could have been much better than it turned out to be and again from personal opinion one of the year's most disappointing. And no, contrary to what its defenders lead you to believe, nobody who disliked the film was expecting an Oscar contender. I myself certainly wasn't, wanted more than anything for the talent to be used to full potential and for the film to be at fun intriguing and fun.Its best asset are the production values and makes up 2 stars of my personal rating, due to them being so good. 'The Tourist' is sensuously photographed, the costumes are suitably elegant and the locations positively dazzle, Venice in particular look stunning.The supporting cast also do well with what they have, another strong case of the supporting cast being significantly better than the leads, Steven Berkoff in particular seems to be really enjoying himself and Paul Bettany is very rarely less than game. Timothy Dalton has fun in a rather underwritten role. Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie are admittedly great eye candy too.However, the two leads underwhelm hugely, and this is coming from someone who has seen great performances from both (Depp in 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood' for examples, and Jolie in 'Changeling' and 'Girl Interrupted'). Depp's performance is a mix of hamminess and being bored out of his mind. Jolie has an ice maiden femme fatale role and not only looks uncomfortable but gives one of the blandest and most annoying performances of this particular type of role in film history. There is no chemistry between them whatsoever either.That the characters are shallow and one dimensional works against the cast, and even more so the script. The script clunks even more so than cutlery being dropped on the floor, one can also really tell that there was more than one writer involved and there is a real sense of them working independently of each other rather than being a team.Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck clearly didn't have any idea what to do with the film, with the momentum and the way the story is told being all over the place. It's the story that dooms 'The Tourist' in particular, a lot of the time it barely goes anywhere and has a tendency to be told in a muddled and convoluted fashion with twists that are easily foreseeable, haphazard and ridiculous. It was very difficult judging 'The Tourist' for what it is, because it tried to be more than one thing (too many) and doesn't do much if at all with any of it.Overall, not a complete disaster but a real disappointment. 4/10 Bethany Cox",The Tourist
1,Leofwine_draca,Sappy,4,2 October 2013,"THE TOURIST is a commendable attempt to make a light comedy/thriller in the mould of movies from the '50s and '60s, usually the type starring Cary Grant or Audrey Hepburn. Everything about the style screams classic old-school Hollywood, and yet the end result is something far less impressive; a silly, way-too-slight and badly-written attempt at something different.On the face of it, Angelina Jolie looks the part of femme fatale, but there's something slightly artificial about her here. She's too good to be true, and way too thin, looking like she'll keel over at the slightest gust of wind. I also found her character slightly, unpleasantly smug. Johnny Depp is just as bad, as there's something faintly embarrassing about his fish-out-of-water turn.The film starts off strongly but lost my interest after the first half hour and never regained it. It does have some good actors in supporting roles, particularly Paul Bettany, Timothy Dalton and Rufus Sewell, but their talents are wasted in favour of having silly chase scenes and ridiculous twists that stretch credulity to breaking point and beyond. Sadly, THE TOURIST was a huge flop for a good reason: it's just a bad film.",The Tourist
2,SnoopyStyle,"stiff, cold",4,9 November 2013,"The mysterious Elise (Angelina Jolie) is being monitored by French police headed by Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) of Scotland Yard and also the Russian mob. They're after Alexander Pearce who stole $744 Million in illegal assets. She throws everybody off by cozying up to tourist Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp) pretending he's Alexander Pearce.Johnny Depp is completely miscast as the everyman tourist. He's freaking Johnny Depp. There are other actors who can fit the persona better. When Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie team up, there is one too many too-cool-for-school A-list star in the room.The other problem has to be the stiff acting style. These two have all the chemistry of two celebrities meeting for the first time on the red carpet. The detached mannerism really drains all the excitement out of the movie. It ends up as some very pretty postcards from Europe. It's 2 dimensional and not very dramatic.",The Tourist
3,mark.waltz,"What's it all about, Anjie?",2,18 May 2016,"Still trying to figure that out. An action style opening is very uninvolving and then nothing really happens for 40 minutes. Angelina Jolie, one of the hottest actresses of the past decade or so, really isn't as much an actress as she is a scandal sheet headline. She has every man practically drooling over her, but I find her to be an ice princess whose career seems to be melting around her. It may take time, but she's a lackluster personality with too much ecologin who just isn't all that interesting on the big screen. Certainly no Audrey Hepburn in ""Roman Holiday"" taking a weekend trip to Venice via Paris.She's involved in some sort of international intrigue, and by sitting with Johnny Depp on the train from Paris to Venice involves him in her caper, putting him in danger, a sequence which finally adds some action when he is chased atop Venitian rooftops by the bad guys and ends up in an Italian prison because of it.Any time that Depp appears on screen, this film manages to be raised a notch, even though his character seems to go from dorky buffoon to wised up and angry, and following Jolie all over in spite of her admission that she just used him.One dimensional bad guys mistake Depp for one of Jolie's associates, and this continues to involve Depp in her intrigue. This should have been much more exciting and fails miserably in its attempts to be a romantic thriller with Jolie yet another adventuress living a James Bond/Indiana Jones life a la Lara Croft. At least that mediocre series moved at a fast pace. This moves along like a snail and has little cleverness. I felt sorry for Depp, but as far as Jolie was concerned, it sludged her down my ratings scale.",The Tourist
4,claudio_carvalho,"A High-Budget, for a Popcorn Version of Anthony Zimmer",4,18 June 2011,"On 21 January 2007, I saw the great French thriller ""Anthony Zimmer"" with Sophie Marceau and Yvan Attal in the lead roles. The plot recalled Hitchcock's classic ""North by Northwest"", i.e., a man mistaken for another and pursued by criminals. Today I have unfortunately seen ""The Tourist"", a high-budget film with the expensive Angeline Jolie and Johnny Depp in the lead roles and fancy locations and costumes. However, despite telling the same story, this remake is a popcorn version of the original story and the director seems to be more interested in displaying the locations and the lead couple than telling the story.My advice: do not spend your time with ""The Tourist""; see ""Anthony Zimmer"" instead and enjoy a magnificent thriller. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""O Turista"" (""The Tourist"")",The Tourist
5,kosmasp,Attractions,7,20 January 2011,"The Tourist does not really know what it is. I am talking about the movie in general mind you, not the character, because that would be wrong. The movie though has quite a few flaws. It feels like if you did a trip to a land, but did not really plan much ahead. And while planning sometimes makes as much sense as not planning at all, it would be nice if the tone of the movie had one ring to it.Still there is much to enjoy on this ""trip"" (as in vacation/travel, not in anything else!) as the two main actors are obviously having fun. And who wouldn't have at an ""exotic"" location as Venice. Nicely and wonderfully shot, you might not even care that much about the story. It might either too predictable or too laughable (or both at the same time). But it still can be lots of fun. And while it might take some easy ways (out), it does have enough spark to ignite your interest ...",The Tourist
6,gavin6942,Better Than I Expected,6,26 May 2011,"Revolves around Frank (Johnny Depp), an American tourist visiting Italy to mend a broken heart. Elise (Angelina Jolie) is an extraordinary woman who deliberately crosses his path.I entered this film expecting it to be a pile of horse apples. I actually sort of liked it... sexy, intriguing, a bit of action and comedy. By no means is this a movie of the year or anything, but it is a fun film and the kind that might make a good date movie.I ma not the sort to kiss Depp's butt. He is a great actor, but he is not flawless. Yet, here, I think he was really expressing a range I do not often see from him anymore. A ladies man who is shy and nervous, the Depp of ""Edward Scissorhands""... back before he was the international superstar. I liked what I saw here.",The Tourist
7,jboothmillard,The Tourist,1,14 April 2011,"Director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck made his debut with The Lives of Others which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, against Pan's Labybrinth, and this follow up with two mega stars everyone thought could be a hit, if only that was the case. Basically English mystery woman Elise Clifton-Ward (Golden Globe nominated Angelina Jolie) boards a train in Paris being trailed by French police, the train is travelling to Venice, and she has instructions from a female colleague to find someone with her looks and build to fool the authorities into thinking it is her. Instead, she randomly selects a man on board, that being American teacher and tourist Frank Tupelo (Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp) who she quickly forms conversation with, and makes him think she is interested in him. Originally the police are fooled into thinking he is indeed her accomplice and lover, but Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) has his identity double checked, only to be disappointed to know he is not the person, ""Alexander Pearce"", they are looking for. However another police person in the department thinks they have found the right person and reignites the search to catch him, and meanwhile Elise makes sure Frank is still with her going to a hotel room together. The next day that is when there are some chases because of the false identity, of course he does not realise they don't want to kill him, but they are shooting as they are trying to kill Elise. Also wanting to catch ""Alexander Pearce"" is Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff) who Elise stole money from, and it just all becomes a big mess with the identity crisis and both mobsters and police chase them. In the end, after Inspector Acheson is brought back into action, everything seems to be sorted as Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) comes in to sort it all, and Frank has his identity proved, and gets with Elise to go off into the sunset. Also starring Rufus Sewell as The Englishman, Christian De Sica as Colonnello Lombardi, Alessio Boni as Sergente Cerato, Daniele Pecci as Tenente Narduzzi and Raoul Bova as Conte Filippo Gaggia. I was first surprised to see the critics rating before seeing the film, because the trailer made it look good, and not just because of the teaming of the two leads, like Brad and Angelina before. Depp is rather dull and only looks the part, and even with a sexy look and English accent Jolie is both boring and annoying, and the supporting cast members hardly do anything, the story with its attempts at twists and turns is ridiculous, it's trying to be like North by Northwest or something, but it just doesn't work, a terrible thriller. Poor!",The Tourist
8,ccthemovieman-1,Decent Homage to '50s/'60s Kind Of Film,7,6 April 2011,"Thanks to a lot of negative reviews, my hopes on enjoying this movie were pretty slim.....so I wound up pleasantly surprised that the film was, at very least, entertaining. Yeah, it was not hard to guess the ""twist"" near the end, but it was an enjoyable, mellow ride.This movie reminded me of old films, '50s and '60s-type spy films in which there is little action but the characters are interesting enough to make you pay attention and see if you can guess who's who and what's what. Kind or like the 1963 hit ""Charade,"" except this movie is much more low key. Cary Grant would have been ideal in Johnny Depp's role.Despite mostly dialog-driven, Angelina Jolie and Depp have star-power faces that will have you involved as does the great European scenery and photography, which is first rate on a Blu-Ray.All in all: a pretty good subtle film and worth a rental.",The Tourist
9,Tweekums,Fun if rather silly thriller,7,29 December 2011,"I didn't know much about this thriller when I sat down to watch it; just what I'd read on the DVD box and that is seldom the best source of information! As it turned out I rather enjoyed it. The opening got me interested very quickly; who was the mysterious woman being watched by French police and what had she done? It must have been serious as Scotland Yard are also after her. She gets a note from a man called Alexander Pierce telling her to take the train to Venice and sit next to somebody who looks a bit like him; she does this and meets American tourist Frank. He thinks he is getting lucky when he is invited to her hotel suite but doesn't realise the danger he is getting into Alexander Pierce has stolen a lot of money from a gangster and used a small portion of it to buy a new face; now that gangster thinks Frank is Alex! In what follows he will be shot at, chased over the Venetian rooftops, arrested and even dragged behind a speedboat, but even though it appears he has been used he falls for the mysterious Elise. Before the films climax there are a few more twists but I won't spoil them here.This might not be the most believable thriller ever made and the twists weren't the most shocking but it was good mindless fun; Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie do decent jobs as Frank and Elise, they are supported by several well known actors including Timothy Dalton, Paul Bettany and Steven Berkoff who are fine. The action is well directed and even though one must be willing to suspend ones disbelief it isn't too ridiculous. It helps that it is set in a beautiful city which provides some stunning backdrops but that is de rigueur in a film like this; after all it was never going for gritty realism. If you want something serious give this a miss but if you want some good mindless fun you could do a lot worse.",The Tourist
10,paul_haakonsen,The mediocre tourist...,5,21 February 2011,"The trailer for this movie was phenomenal, the movie, however, was just mediocre.As for the story told in ""The Tourist"", well it was quite nice actually, captivating and interesting, though it was was rather predictable. But still it provided good entertainment.The cast in ""The Tourist"" was nothing short of amazing. Of course, you know what you are in for whenever you see a movie starring Johnny Depp (playing Frank Tupelo). And his performance in this movie was spectacular. He was, in my opinion, the one carrying the weight of the movie. Angelina Jolie (playing Elise Clifton-Ward) also put on a good enough performance in the movie, but she was not up at the same level as Johnny Depp. It should also be noted that the performance put on by Paul Bettany (playing inspector John Acheson) was also quite good. And of course, though a rather small role, Timothy Dalton (playing chief inspector Jones) added some color to the movie. And Steven Berkoff (playing Reginald Shaw) was really well-picked for his particular role.I had expected more from this movie, so I was somewhat disappointed when the movie ended. However, if you watch the movie without having seen the trailers and without having any expectations, then ""The Tourist"" will prove quite entertaining.The movie is full of really good locations and nice shots, so it is a treat for the eye, at least. A shame that the trailer had hyped this movie up as much as it had. Not the best movie of the year, but far from a bad movie at least.",The Tourist
11,blanche-2,Lovely to look at,6,28 March 2011,"Two powerhouse stars, Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, team up to make ""The Tourist,"" a 2010 film directed and partially written by Florian Henkel von Donnersmarck, who directed the magnificent ""The Lives of Others."" He kind of misses the water taxi here.Jolie plays Elise Clifton-Ward, the girlfriend of mafia personal banker Stephen Pearce, who stole $2 billion from his boss, Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff). Therefore, everyone is after him: the British, who want the tax money they are owed, and Reginald Shaw, who wants his money back. Elise receives a note from Pearce, who has had $24 million of plastic surgery done in Brazil. He tells her to get on a train to Venice and find someone who is his same size and convince her followers that he is their target. She does so, happening upon a tourist, Frank, a math teacher from the U.S. There is an air of detachment about this film. Angelina Jolie is drop-dead gorgeous as is the city of Venice. Not only that, but she gets to wear some beautiful clothes. Mostly she walks around looking fantastic as people follow her. Depp, a fabulous actor, doesn't really register as the hapless Frank. Johnny Depp, who can do anything. He's just not really there. As far as chemistry, the two don't have any. So I have to come to the conclusion that this isn't very well directed. When two actors capable of powerful performances don't measure much on the Richter scale, there's a problem, and it isn't them. For one thing, the movie moves at too leisurely a pace for this type of film. For another, it's too disjointed. There are some good comedic elements, some drama, some adventure, but it's a hodge-podge. The police characters are better developed than Elise and Frank.A misguided attempt with a couple of good twists at the end. See it for the stunning Jolie, see it for her outfits, see it for Venice, see it for the twists. I don't have to tell you not to get too involved in the story or the lead characters. You won't.",The Tourist
12,Quinoa1984,"a breezy view for TV on a day with nothing better to do, not really to rush to see",6,12 December 2010,"Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, a big subway sandwich of a name, has become a major player in world cinema following his film The Lives of Others, an excellent drama on humanity in the face of Cold-War paranoia in the 1980's. One almost forgets he directs this though when seeing The Tourist. Maybe it's because, frankly, anyone by the look of it could have directed it. It's possible there wasn't a really distinct style in Lives of Others anyway, that he just made a good movie with a solid story that was professional if artful. This time he's making a remake of a French film starring two of the biggest heavyweight-command- 20+-million stars, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp (stars so major they could be referred to almost by first name), and it's a breezy affair. So breezy that it tries, somewhat admirably, to hearken back to the 1940's and 1950's star-vehicle spy thrillers that Hitchcock might make. 'Might' being the operative word here. He'd have a little more fun with the same material.Two meet on a train, a woman and a man, the woman after getting a letter from her (at the start we think) lover Alexandre, who says to meet a man on a train to make ""them"" (the Inter-Pol or whomever following her to get to the international criminal Alexandre) think it's him. Enter in Johnny Depp's Frank, smoking a not-real cigarette and reading a spy novel, a Math professor 'Tourist' (everyone who wants to make him sound less important just uses that last word and moves along), and then they get into some shenanigans. That is he does as a group of gangsters looking to get the umpteenth millions that is owed to them by this Alexandre person. But where is the ""real"" one? Where and when will he pop up in this glorious Venice backdrop.Why go on further about the story except to say that there are two twists in the film? Well, at the least I can tell you that I saw one twist coming, the bigger one, almost from the start of the film. It was a suspicion only, nothing more, though one that became clearer as it went along. When it's revealed I was almost disappointed there was not more to it, like a ""oh, yeah, whatever"". The smaller twist escaped me until it was revealed, though a slighter suspicion was held. I keep thinking about the potential twists in these spy thriller-things. Not as a means of really being drawn in by the story, but because of the cynicism built up over the years. If it were Hitchcock, to bring up his name, trekking with Cary Grant and/or whatever-blonde-star, that thought wouldn't cross my mind. This is a deterrent in a way, as it shows a lack of focus with the story itself. But it does make things a little more fun, just to figure when ""it"" will reveal itself.Oh, the stars? They do alright, more or less. We feel comfortable with these stars, who are first actors, and Jolie is certainly very fit for a role like this where she has to look sexy, confident, and sometimes lethal. She's like a second-tier version of her super-bad-ass in Salt (a real pretzel of a movie from this same year), but is fun to see with her gorgeous dresses and wide-saucer eyes. Depp is a little trickier to peg; it's not until halfway into the movie that I could figure on why he took on this project. One doesn't see him play these ""ordinary"" people too often, but then again it's part of the charm to see him acting all normal and quietly befuddled at the good strokes of luck of a woman as Ravenous (sorry, nay, Ravishing) as Jolie is, and then getting the fabulous digs he gets in Venice with her, and out to dinner no less. Their banter is good, if only in their delivery if not always the words, and the double-meaning of what might be going on kept me not always bored. The Tourist, as you could guess from my reaction, is pretty to watch and not too hard to think about. It doesn't offend with any super- pyrotechnics; it's innocent about its action through most of the time, even with its BIG villain who does older-than-old (or just revitalized?) clichés like killing the subordinate who screws up. But it doesn't go past its own basic strokes; supporting characters are passable like Dalton and Betany, but don't add much character to their characters either. Suspense builds intermittently, and then stops short when one sees where scenes are definitely headed. And the twist... it's silly, and it will tick a lot of people off. For me it went through the rest of the movie. It's a minor work of intended escapism by a filmmaker who should, and hopefully will, be doing better.",The Tourist
13,tavm,"The Tourist should provide some nice distraction courtesy of Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, and the Venice scenery",5,1 January 2011,"All right, I've just watched this throwback to the Hitchcock romance suspensers of the '50s with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in roles that might have been taken by Cary Grant and Grace Kelly way back then with my movie theatre-working friend in tow and while he may have had the time of his life, I admit I partly fell asleep during some of the beginning but managed to mostly keep awake when some exciting scenes came on. I guess it was partly because of my sleepy nature that I didn't find myself entertained at certain places or even getting what was going on but by the end, I knew enough that I was a little pleasantly surprised at the plot, even though the premise probably didn't make a lick of sense even thinking back about the whole thing. So on that note, I'd say The Tourist is worth a look if you're a fan of the two stars and you don't think too much about the story...",The Tourist

16,Theo Robertson,More Like A Tourist Advert,6,23 March 2014,"This has a couple of big names and lots of expensive location filming in Europe . Hopes might be restrained somewhat when you stop to consider just how many commercial mainstream blockbusters Johnny Depp where he hasn't played a pirate , ie not many . Here he plays a character called Frank Tupelo in a role that could easily have gone to Ewan McGregor . Actually when you stop to think about it Paul Bettany's police inspector could have easily gone to Christopher Eccleston . I'll leave it to you to make up your own mind if simple cast interchange signify you'd still be watching the exact same film One interesting point that people have picked up upon is how similar this is to these star vehicles from the 1960s where an American ( Usually played by a British born Hollywood star ) visits Europe , meets a local girl with a dark past and gets involved in all sorts of criminal intrigue in a sort of Hitchcock wannabe thriller . It's difficult not to spot what this is exactly what it's trying to be except it does do this very well . The pace is languid and the director wants to show Venice at its best , all most like a tourist advert and makes for a fairly boring film . That said it does have Steven Berkoff give an amazingly restrained performance so it does deserve some credit",The Tourist

18,zardoz-13,"""The Tourist"" Is A Sight That Isn't Worth Seeing!",4,5 January 2011,"Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp make a great looking couple in German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's crime thriller ""The Tourist,"" an elegant but anemic homage to Alfred Hitchcock movies about strangers who meet on a train and fall in love. Everything about the PG-13 rated ""Tourist"" looks great, too. ""Dead Poets Society"" lenser John Seale makes every shot of our well-coiffed heroine in control and our debonair hero in jeopardy around scenic Venice appear absolutely stunning. Aside from one scene where a man is strangled rather unbelievably with a tailor's measuring tape, the violence qualifies as standard-issue combat with nothing that particularly distinguishes it from ten-thousand other lackluster thrillers. In other words, the violence never escalates into the blood, gore, and more variety with blasted-off body parts or exotic forms of mayhem. Meantime, Donnersmarck and scenarists Christopher McQuarrie of ""The Usual Suspects"" and Julian Fellowes of ""Vanity Fair"" have contrived what amounts to a predictable potboiler about mistaken identities. The formulaic screenplay, sketchy characters, and the absence of anything masquerading as momentum undercuts this static picture-postcard exercise in suspense. Not surprisingly, the filmmakers try to be clever with a surprise ending that may pull the rug out from under some audiences while others may scoff at this sloppy trick. Aside from Seale's sensational cinematography, ""The Tourist"" boasts a top-notch cast that features Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, Timothy Dalton, and Steven Berkoff. The lack of substance in the storyline ultimately undercuts this fine looking film.Madison Community College mathematics instructor Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp of ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise) is on holiday in Europe when he encounters the hopelessly beautiful, Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie of ""Salt""), on a Parisian train bound for Venice. They strike up an acquaintance and then have a quirky one-sided romantic romp that absorbs the better part of the movie. Mind you, ""The Tourist"" qualifies as a helium-weighted, romance comedy with one abrasive scene. No, Frank's dark magnetism has nothing to do with Elise's decision to approach him on the train. She is a mysterious dame herself who has been under constant surveillance by the authorities in England and France. French authorities, particularly the Financial Crimes Division, struggle to be inconspicuous as they follow her around in a van decked out with all the latest surveillance technology. They arrest anybody that she talks to that may fit the description of a criminal who has stolen over $744 million. They arrest a bicycle courier when he delivers a message to Elisa at a café. Moreover, they stay in constant contact with Scotland Yard, specifically Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany of ""Legion""), who has been trying to catch Elise with a notorious Englishman, an international fugitive named Alexander Pearce. Pearce, its seems, appropriated his millions from the most evil gangster in Europe, Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff of ""Beverly Hills Cop""), who doesn't so much kill his adversaries but annihilate them and their families. He boasts at one point that he killed both anybody who made love to his wife before they met and everybody afterward. Essentially, Shaw sounds like Keyser Söze, the Turkish criminal mastermind from Christopher Macquarie's ""The Usual Suspects"" script.When the French authorities send Acheson a photograph of the latest Pearce suspect, a corrupt Scotland Yard administrative assistant leaks word to Shaw about Pearce. Of course, Frank Tupelo isn't Pearce. Indeed, Elisa strikes up an affair of sorts with Tupelo because the real Pearce told her to find somebody that approximated his height and weight and mislead the authorities into thinking that he was Pearce. Before long, our clueless hero finds himself dodging bullets from Shaw's Eastern Bloc gunmen. Later, he finds himself handcuffed in a boat trying to escape more of Shaw's incompetent henchmen. Shaw has little patience for their ineptitude. He strangles one with a tailor's measuring tape in front of the tailor as well as his own men. Shaw is the toughest character in ""The Tourist"" and the least likable.Acheson's boss at Scotland Yard, Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton of ""The Living Daylights"") has spent $8 million trying to track down Pearce and he wants no more to do with the man. Nevertheless, his insubordinate subordinate sticks with the case and even Jones believes that they have gotten their man. The showdown in Venice with a Scotland Yard sniper team proving their enviable expertise with telescopic rifles is about as good as ""The Tourist"" gets before it pulls its switcheroo ploy. As clever as it appears initially, this reversal lacks credibility. At the same time, the international fugitive proves his love for the heroine and Jones walks away gratified, even though Acheson doesn't believe a word of it!Angelina Jolie plays a seductress who can wear an off-the-shoulder gown and pick a lock with ease. She is at her most elegant and cavorts about in fashionable apparel and high heels. Johnny Depp is at his most vulnerable in a role that provides him with little in the way of mystery. He wears his whiskers with style and smokes an ingenious looking device masquerading as a cigarette. This mechanical cigarette resembles an actual filter-tipped cigarette except it delivers only nicotine and water vapor so user appears to be smoking. The glow on the end is furnished courtesy of an led. Keep your eyes on that cigarette closely if you want to really enjoy this sly but shallow film. The British supporting cast, including former James Bond Timothy Dalton and Paul Bettany, make the police look good. The most interesting but least seen character is another Englishman (Rufus Sewell of ""Dark City"") who skulks at the periphery. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directing is flawless, but the same cannot be said of the screenplay.

20,neil-476,Unconvincing tosh,6,16 December 2010,"Mysterious glamourpuss Elise (Angelina Jolie) picks up vacationing maths teacher Frank (Johnny Depp) on a train journey to Venice, apparently as a decoy - it appears that her equally mysterious (and unseen) boyfriend is being pursued by unhinged Interpol policeman Paul Bettany and vicious international business crook Steven Berkoff (not to mention the Italian police). And, of course, anyone and everyone may or may not be exactly who they appear to be. Or not to be.Sold misleadingly as an action thriller, this is more of a suspense/mystery thriller - there is some action, but it is relatively sparse. Although there is always something happening, which thereby holds your interest, much of what takes place is fairly implausible (in particularly, Bettany's Interpol officer is so rabid as to be completely unbelievable). There are times when things are clearly played for laughs, but they are so infrequent that you can't take the film as a comedy thriller. Depp and Jolie sleepwalk through their roles (Jolie does her Lara Croft English accent) and Bettany snarls his way over the top and down the other side.After various pursuits and revelations, there is a surprise denouement which is, quite frankly, the least convincing surprise twist I can recall for some time.

21,ferguson-6,A Downgrade from Room Service,4,11 December 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh, beautiful people in beautiful places. That's a good start! Throw in some amazing film blood lines: directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (The Lives of Others), writers Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects), Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park) and Jerome Salle. Salle wrote and directed the 2005 French film that this one is based on - Anthony Zimmer. The stellar cast is led by Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, and includes Paul Bettany, Timothy Dalton, Rufus Sewell and the always solid Steven Berkhoff. No way to mess this one up, right?? Somehow, despite all of that, the final product is a jumble of tired visual stunts, lame dialogue and a twist so obvious it might as well have been in the trailer. The aim was a thriller with involvement of mobsters, stolen millions, boat chases, rooftop shootings, crackling dialogue intertwined with dangerous settings and high fashion. The biggest failing is with the dialogue ... so many wasted moments. The give and take between Depp and Jolie is just outright lame. Where is the payoff for sitting through the endless string of stupid moves from Scotland Yard inspectors? The police tail on Jolie's character looked like something from the Pink Panther movies ... only it is played straight! Same with the interactions between the two stars. How about some playful banter? Did Depp's character need to be so dull? A math teacher from Wisconsin. Really? And poor Angelina. She is used as a flesh and blood Jessica from Who Framed Roger Rabbit. EVERYTHING about her is exaggerated! Yet, she still flashes her glances like her characters from Salt or any other action film she has upgraded over the years. It just doesn't work here.And I have to mention the absurdity of the chase scenes through the Venice canal. It's not very often a boat chase scene is limited to 4 knots speed. How could the shooters miss time after time? At least we were treated to some stunning shots of Venice. That's the only positive I can offer for this one.",The Tourist

Johnny Depp plays a professor whom is suddenly hooked up with Angelina Jolie. This sends him on the run when authorities mistake him for someone whom owes a great deal of money. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is backed with exquisite locations and photography as well as sets that compliment the era that it attempts to portray as well as the films that inspired it. Jolie is perfect as the mysterious woman whom enchants and fills Depp with wonderment. Both leads play out numerous plot twists before certain secrets are revealed. Both leads also transcend what made the old spy films so appealing. This film even contains a similar look, which works to greater effect. Paul Bettany plays the straight forward yet effective role of CIA agent foiled at every opportunity. Timothy Dalton as a gangster is the weakest aspect particularly his contrived conclusion. Depp is the modern symbol that was portrayed by Cary Grant in Charade, and Jolie gives off that mysterious wonderment that Audrey Hepburn gave off in the same film. The film is underrated perhaps because it doesn't follow the standard action formula and is better structured. It keeps viewers interested as well as provide several plot turns to complicate the mission. Its one big flaw is with the fact that the villains are about as interesting as cracked pavement. Otherwise it is a fine send off to spy films. Score: 8 ½ / 10",The Tourist

On the train, she talks to an American, Frank, suggests they have dinner, and, once in Venice, invites him to her hotel.The bait is set: the Russians think Frank is the man they want: Alexander Pearce, who stole billions from the mobster.Scotland Yard realises Frank is a just a tourist, but by now he's in danger, smitten by the mystery woman, and in their way....Seventeen years ago, Depp would have been replaced by either Cruise, Hanks of even Ford. Jolie would have been replaced by Roberts. It would have been released in the summer and would have been one of the biggest films of that year.But that was when we hardly had comic book movies, and summer blockbusters were sparse, and movies would make money on the star quality alone. But that isn't the case now. Arguably two of the most bankable stars in the world, cannot guarantee big box office, if the story and narrative is a little slouchy.And while the film is breezy, and fun while it lasts, you can't help but want a little more than Depp acting confused and Jolie walking around as if she was in some sort of perfume advert (everyone turns when she walks out of a room).Bettany does his best with his role and is easily the best thing here, while Berkoff has never seemed to switch off Maitland from Beverly hills cop.It's one of those movies that just happens, is okay while it lasts, and forgettable the next day.",The Tourist
24,gradyharp,A Thin Storyline Successfully Disgised by Gorgeous Cinematography,8,23 March 2011,"THE TOURIST has many flaws, not the least of which is the fact that it doesn't seem to be able to make up its mind whether it is a suspense thriller, a romantic comedy, or a travelogue. But despite all of its weaknesses, on the small screen in the home it comes across as an Italian delicacy well worth watching. Bouncing around from Paris to Scotland Yard and eventually to serenissima Venice the visuals (thanks to cinematographer John Seale's ability to capture the flavors of Venice so beautifully) steal the show. The story written by none other than Julian Fellowes ('Gosford Park', 'Separate Lies', 'Young Victoria', 'Vanity Fair', 'From Time to Time') with director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, Christopher McQuarrie, and Jérôme Salle (whose 2005 French thriller 'Anthony Zimmer' spawned this American version) is quirky by entertaining, and the musical score by James Newton Howard adds distinction to the film. Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie, dressed to the nines and looking like a mannequin) is on a mission: she is being closely followed on secret video by Scotland Yard Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) and Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) who expect her to meet up with one Alexander Pearce and gain back the money stolen from crime lord Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff). She eludes capture and boards a train to Venice where her instructions from Pearce suggest that she meet a man who looks like Pearce. Interpol is engaged and the Italian police - led by Sergente Cerato (the extraordinarily handsome Alessio Boni) et al - pickup the chase for Scotland yard. On the train Elise meets American spy-fiction fan and math teacher Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp) and manipulates his emotions and attention to the point that Frank follows Elise to Venice - and the mystery thickens. Amid interesting characters are 'The Englishman' (Rufus Sewell) and Conte Filippo Gaggia (the ultimate Italian leading man Raoul Bova, remembered for his important role in 'Under the Tuscan Sun') who add to the suspense and incidents of mistaken identity. To say anything further would rob the viewer of what little suspense the script contains. The very fine cast seems to be sleepwalking through much of the story, but they are still so terrific to watch that they make the film a fine evening's entertainment. Probably this film is better on DVD than it was one the big screen in theaters: the story seems more intimate and the relationships more credible. Grady Harp",The Tourist
25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Tourist,7,30 December 2010,"A lot has been said about how insipid this film turned out to be, even with the appeal of two of Hollywood's A-listers in Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie failing to lift this film from mediocrity. I'd beg to differ and wonder whether these blabbers have grown so accustomed to Jolie kicking ass as some sexed up alpha-female, and Depp being flamboyant under dark eyeliner, that they refuse to accept anything else should these two actors decide to take a break and play, well, ordinary Joe and Jane.It's a breath of fresh air to see them do absolutely nothing to reinforce their typical persona stereotypes. For once I don't have to witness Jolie being the action heroine, and Depp junking his quirky characterization, playing two folks who fall in love under extraordinary circumstances when they first meet on a Euro-train travelling from one romantic city to another - Paris to Venice - and for once felt a little helpless rather than almost always coming out on top. The courtship ritual is just plain hilarious even though the lines may appear a little stilted, playing upon the usual games people play in hooking up. Needless to say the twists and turns from the mid point to the last act isn't something that you won't see coming, and in some ways continue to play up to expectations of an average caper involving a major mistaken identity.An adaptation of the French film Anthony Zimmer, The Tourist was one heck of a troubled project to begin with, having revolving doors for lead cast and the director even, before settling for Depp and Jolie, with Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who gave us The Lives of Others, at the helm of this Euro-thriller. Jolie plays Elise Clifton-Ward, an elegant clotheshorse who is tailed by a Scotland Yard team managed by Paul Bettany's Inspector John Acheson, who is dead set on keeping a mark on this female target so as to chance upon any opportunity to capture her main squeeze Alexander Pearce, the enigma of this story who has embezzled money from the mob, as well as evaded government taxes.In a betrayal of Judas proportions, Elise condemns her new acquaintance Frank Tupelo (Depp), an American math school teacher on holiday whom she deliberately picked out amongst the passengers as instructed for his close physical resemblance to Pearce, to being marked himself by Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff), the man whom Pearce had stolen from and is looking to recover his money, pride and seek revenge, which leads this film into a cat and mouse chase involving both the cops and the robbers after our two leads, who soon find it difficult not to fall in love after pulling through the ordeal they're under. But for their good looks and individual charisma, sparks didn't fly and you're constantly left wondering whether they would, or won't, and if there's always more than meets the eye.Those looking for action in this caper will definitely be disappointed, as set action pieces are few and far between, looking very tame from a rooftop chase to a motorboat pursuit, which don't break any new ground. Attempts at comedy usually fell flat, and you'll get more fun from the string of recognizable cameos from Timothy Dalton to Rufus Sewell popping up from time to time. Visuals are absolutely gorgeous since it's set on location allowing for the capture of Venice's best side and angle, and made me reminisce my own limited time spent in the city, and fashionistas will likely go gaga over the designs put onto Jolie.While this film may be somewhat of a weaker cousin to all the spy versus spy movies out there, it isn't as bad as most would have said it was. It doesn't have any big explosions nor noisy gun fights, lacked a certain sharpness in wit in its dialogue which could be worst if not for the screen presence of Depp and Jolie, and a final twist that wasn't really necessary, something I felt robbed the show of its ultimate emotional quotient of the everyday, average Joe who had risked everything to dream of walking away into the sunset with the girl.",The Tourist

Of course for the lookers there is Ms. Jolie. Just imagine a spy getting the assignment full time of peeking as Ms. Jolie without risk of arrest as a peeping Tom. Well, we've got that here and then more.This film takes the classic Hitchcock film ""Strangers On A Train"" and twists the plot in an entirely different direction. Ms. Jolie is being leered at by detectives in anticipation of her meeting a certain wanted man who the folks are really after. She gets a note from him instructing her to get on a train and pick out a stranger that looks like him. In classic Hollywood fashion this guy she picks out happens to be Mr. Depp.There are tips to the ending which are subtle and telling. The main thing is the back ground of Depp's character is a middle aged teacher who is widowed for 3 years and traveling alone as a tourist in Europe. I wonder how many women would give their eye teeth to board a train in Europe & pick this guy out?While this film does pretty good at subtle fantasy, I can see where the two actors fans want more.

28,lasttimeisaw,The Tourist,7,14 February 2011,"The first foreign film I have watched at a Chinese cinema in 2011, I deliberately selected this out of TRON LEGACY (2010) and THE GREEN HORNET (2011), the reason is quite obvious, it's all because of Venice and Johnny Depp.Surely I have heard too many bad reviews and its nightmare North American box office, which could put both Johnny and Angie's fame in shame (including the ridiculous Golden Globe nominations). Plus it is a remake and I happened to watch its original French version ANTHOY ZIMMER (2005) many years ago, which was not so marvelous either (but I do remember the final twist). Therefore while harboring an expectation to be thoroughly disappointed, unexpectedly it turned out to be very entertaining both to me and my partner, maybe a part of the merit should be owe to the cinema's comfortable VIP room.There is no glint between this so-called the-most-sexy-man-and-woman-on-earth-pair and the evidence is certain, which has damaged the hearts of numerous fervent fans, however I gonna appraise Johnny Depp's low-key performance despite world condemnation. The ordinary-joe setting of his identity does splatter comforting senses to the spectators and surprisingly makes me feel more authentic towards his character. As for Angelina Jolie, this time there is no need of embodying herself as superwoman SALT, dressing elegant and talking seductive is her only task (it's just a piece of cake!). My sole regret is to Mr. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, he did his best to make the film watchable and joyful, but it just shouldn't been his job, please go back to Germany and use the money earned from Hollywood to fully wield your talent and make us another opus like THE LIVES OF OTHERS (2006). Also I think the genre classification should take the blame since if one doesn't look for an action thriller, this romantic-hauled comedy could be quite pleasing, and after all how could one doesn't fall in love with Venice after watching this film?

But decided to check it out since it has Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in it, since the movies they are in is entertaining most of the time. Even if the trailer to this movie didn't really grab my attention or interest. It's like they got two famous celebs and didn't care about the rest, angelina just has a constant smirk on her face trying to show she is cunning. But unlike what I expected there is hardly any cunning action sequences for her, just her facial expression comes off as cunning. Depp tries to sort of make himself not as attractive by gaining 10 pounds compared to the elegant looking Jolie, but he didn't really stand out or anything like that in this movie. I agree mostly with the negative aspects of this movie, the premise might have seem good but the execution is just done poorly. There is just too many flaws, the plot is very simple and yet doesn't really go anywhere and comes off very dull and just way too simple in a negative way. The romance wasn't even good in this, the chemistry just isn't very well done. The start was alright and although the 2 characters start off with a little potential and doesn't even come close to being used to their full potential. This is a very dull movie, including the dialogue. Almost everything about this movie is just very poorly written.

30,OllieSuave-007,Wooden and Bland.,4,21 February 2014,"Set in the beautiful city of Venice, Elise (Angelina Jolie) sits next to an American tourist Frank (Johnny Depp) on a train bound for the city. Scotland Yard and a mobster Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff) are searching for a man named Alexander Pearce, who is suspected to be Elise's lover and alleged to have stolen billions from Shaw. Elise makes both the police and the mobsters believe that random tourist Frank is the man they want, and what follows is a less-than-thrilling game of cat and mouse.The setting in Venice is probably the best thing I could spot in this movie. Everything else is pretty much bland - from the acting to the boring plot.Johnny Depp looked very wooden and stiff in his performance and there is virtually no chemistry between him and Angelina Jolie. Paul Bettany appeared he was confused and puzzled in his portrayal of Inspector John Acheson and Steven Berkoff, whom always play villains, seemed to put in overtime in playing a jerk of a character in his role. The only decent acting I see is that of Timothy Dalton (always nice to see a 007 alum). And, I have to say that the climax was pretty unpredictable and came as a surprise.

Such as it was, the story revolves around a case of mistaken (or at least uncertain) identity. Angelina Jolie played Elise, apparently some sort of British agent who's mixed up with a super criminal (played by Johnny Depp.) There are a small handful of humorous moments in this, and an even smaller number of exciting scenes, but generally speaking, this lacked any sense of energy from the very first moment - a flaw with the story that was mirrored by the performances of the cast, none of whom seemed especially excited to have been involved with this.

32,Hellmant,What were they thinking (other than what they were going to spend their money on)?!,5,11 December 2010,"'THE TOURIST': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Two of Hollywood's biggest stars (Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie) team up for this goofy spy thriller. It's a remake of a 2005 French film entitled 'ANTHONY ZIMMER' which starred Sophie Marceau and Yvan Attal. The American remake is co-written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmark who also directed the critically acclaimed German film 'THE LIVES OF OTHERS'. I have not seen that film but his writing and directing here is pretty weak. Pretty much the only good thing this film has going for it is it's two stars (and a decent supporting cast including Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton) but it really has me wondering what ever attracted the two to this film to begin with! Jolie plays Elise, the beautiful mistress of a mafia money-man who embezzled over $2 billion from a big time mobster (played by Steven Berkoff). The British police want the embezzler for it's share of the $775 million in tax money on the stolen money. They don't know what their target looks like though so they've been trailing Elise for a couple years hoping she'll lead them to their man. After receiving a note from her lover Elise sits next to a random American tourist named Frank (Depp) on a train hoping to lead the police into believing he's the culprit but she unwittingly gets him targeted by the mafia as well placing him in grave danger. Of course the two quickly fall for each other (despite the extreme lack of chemistry between the two leads).The story is pretty simple and routine but it does have a couple clever twists towards the end and the climax is enjoyable. There are a few funny lines here and there (mostly by Depp) but for the most part the dialog is less than impressive. The direction is uninspired and the film feels like a million other mistaken identity movies we've already seen before. Depp is funny though and Jolie looks gorgeous. Like many big star combinations in film the movie is a disappointment though. If only they had picked a better project together the combined talent could have made for a truly entertaining film. I expect more from Jolie and a lot more from Depp. I seriously don't know what they were thinking, other than maybe what they were going to spend their money on.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68YJe1yftWY",The Tourist

How can two great stars agree to such a bore as 'The Tourist' (1.5/5 Stars)? Besides the obvious ""free Venice vacation"" – in addition to being paid for it, mind you, I can't think of a logical reason. These two showed zero chemistry, had zero good lines and both led us to one of the most obvious conclusions in the ""trick"" of a finale. Sure, Angelina looked gorgeous (Johnny, not so much) and the scenery was crisp and absolutely breathtaking – much like Angelina, but both leads looked as tired and bored with the so-called script. In addition, it didn't seem to know what kind of movie it wanted to be: deep espionage? Beautiful romance? Kooky slapstick? Sadly, which ever the wheel of misfortunate landed on, the director/writer failed. Question: as much of a Johnny Depp fan I used to be, did the 'Pirate's movies go to his head so far that he feels he just needs to show up to sell tickets? I mean, unbelievably, this movie costs $100,000,000. WHERE DID THAT MONEY GO?!?

As a thriller, it's decidedly short on thrills, as a love story, there's absolutely no chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp and as a mystery...well I saw the ending from about 90 minutes back. I don't know if the director was trying for a sort of updated Cary Grant / Audrey Hepburn or Sophia Loren type sophisticated feature from the early 60's but if so it failed palpably. Depp, for one thing, drops into his stock nerdy geek persona as a supposedly ordinary average guy accidentally caught up in a sting operation to flush out a revenge-seeking English gangster on the warpath against the mysterious Mr Pearce, his former associate who's somehow managed to relieve him of $544 million. Jolie's impeccably dressed English glamour-puss is the conduit through which both the police and the baddies try to flush him out, having previously been set up by the police as an insider in their criminal operation but who inconveniently appears to have fallen in love with the mystery man.Got all that? Well this mission highly improbable tries to spice things up somewhat with some rather unconvincing action scenes in and around Venice, one the inevitable boat- race, the other finding Depp escaping across the rooftops barefoot and in his pyjamas, as you do. Jolie meanwhile purrs and sashays through scene after scene, like she's just walked off a catwalk. With shallow characterisation, contrived plotting and in truth some highly uninteresting acting, this touristic experience is one best avoided by staying at home.",The Tourist
36,dromasca,a tourist trap,5,16 January 2012,"I confess that I do not like at all Angelina Jolie. As an actress she does not seem to me to have done anything that uses more her acting talent than her looks, and her looks ... well, she is not my genre and I am probably not her genre, and I cannot care less about her romance with Brad or about their adopted children. On the other hands I deeply admire Johnny Depp, he made me watch even the pirates movies, and he is one of these actors who in my view cannot do wrong. So, I took a risk and pressed the Record button on the cable channel to record The Tourist and then the Play one to see it. Why? Maybe it was the name of the director who made me decide - it's Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and in case you believe it's a long German name just go to IMDb to see what his full name is - and the reason is that in his not too long record there is one of the best films in the history of post-Communist era films about Eastern Europe - The Lives of Others.The Tourist can not only be made by another director than The Lives of Others but could actually be produced on another planet. It's a tourist trap, and I fell into it semi-willingly. It's yet another thriller about hidden identities, with a story which starts in Paris to be continued in Venice via a high speed train, with much too many quotes from Hitchcock and his followers and too little real thrill and emotion. The bad guys look so cartoon-like that we feel no joy or sorrow when they are taken down in a few seconds.Would I recommend this film? Do I consider it completely wasted time? None of these actually. Angelina Jolie acts as I expected, in other words as a beautifully-shaped wooden doll. Depp is not at his best, seems slightly amused to be in the film, but at the end of the day he succeeds to save the film from total loss.

Scotland Yard, you see, under the direction of Inspectors Acheson (Paul Bettany) and Jones (Timothy Dalton), want money owed to the British government, by Elise's boyfriend, Alexander. They are convinced that eventually he will return to his beautiful flame. One day, it appears they are correct. At a cafe, Elise receives a note, which she promptly burns, leaving it on a plate while she heads to the train station. Amazingly, from the charred fragments, the Yard, using advanced tech, reconstructs the message. They all hop a train to Lyon and, from there, to Venice. But, Elise, sensing her trackers, makes friends with an American math teacher, Frank (Johnny Depp), who is likewise on a journey to Venice. Because they have no photo of Alexander, only a general description, the Yard assumes this is their man. Naturally, Frank is taken by Elise's stunning appearance and seductive manner and agrees to spend the night with her at a posh hotel. In the morning, she is gone. But, now the Yard is after Frank and they are not the only ones in pursuit. The British mobster, Shaw, who Alexander also robbed, in his role as a personal banker, is out to eliminate him, too. With his Russian thugs as companions, will Shaw get to Frank first or will the Yard? Or will Elise suddenly return to rescue Frank? This is a very entertaining little bit of cinema, somewhat similar to such movies as To Catch a Thief. First, the stars are dynamic, with Jolie and Depp true ""stars"" who command attention. Depp looks a bit scruffy, as his character is to be played as a non-descript Yankee, and that's a minor shame, given his handsome face. Jolie, however, looks sensational. Bettany, Dalton and the others do fine work as well. The sets are exotic, and the costumes are gorgeous, also. It's true, the story unfolds rather slowly and the direction is sometimes pedestrian. A better edit and camera work would have made a big difference in the overall presentation. But, still, if you are the type who adores a film which takes you away from mundane daily life, you will not be disappointed in this one. No, its not a tour de force but The Tourist is great escapist entertainment.",The Tourist
41,cosmo_tiger,A movie with a lot of bad reviews that doesn't disappoint. Lack of chemistry and bored looking actors. Not impressed. I say C,4,20 March 2011,"How do you protect yourself when everyone is after you thinking you are someone else. After meeting on a train Elise meets Frank. The police and the Russian mob assume Frank is the Alexander they are looking for and the chase begins. After all the bad reviews and the talk about this movie I was a little leery to watch it. Before I start I should say that I've never really been a fan on Angelina Jolie or Johnny Depp. This movie was about what I expected. Going in you would assume that with these two the acting would be great and carry the movie. Just the opposite was true. The chemistry between the two of them was so bad it was almost distracting. To be fair it was a little better then I expected, but I'm blown away that this movie was nominated for best actor, actress and picture and the Golden Globes.

43,tabuno,A Decent but Not Perfect Crime Thriller,7,18 January 2019,"2 January 2011. Not quite a CHARADE (1963) charm and sophisticated, best music protégé, nor a romantic, comedy, action thriller like MR. AND MRS. SMITH (2005), nor the sustained blockbuster action adventure like TRUE LIES (1994), or even this year's more light-hearted, summer action thriller DAY AND KNIGHT (2010) or the less sophisticated consistent comedy action thriller KILLERS (2010). This much more slower rendition focuses more on the CHARADE approach to deceptive criminal action, supported by a decent musical backdrop, and more of an emphasis on character and plot than action and thrills. Yet without the insinuating charm of Gary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, the movie's sustaining ability to completely engross the audience is strained, especially as the genre is suspect - without the comedy and without the serious focus on drama, this movie seems to have less of a compelling attraction. Nevertheless, a decent, entertaining, if perhaps somewhat predictable but enjoyable outcome. Perhaps, remake of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR (1999) doubled but without the involved sustained interplay and action is the basis on which to compare THE TOURIST.",The Tourist
44,Dr_Coulardeau,A Robin Hood sleeps in all our hearts,9,22 January 2011,"Don't expect a deep moral, ethical, political or religious meaning in this film. It is not an author's film , as they say in Paris. It is first of all a remake of the eternal Arsène Lupin or Rouletabille to remain French, or simpler Robin Hood to turn English, or William Wallace to lean towards Scotland. And definitely I am fascinated by these thieves who steal the money of the very rich for their own sake, with a few crumbs to the poorest. And here the very rich are Russian, making fortunes in casinos and brothels, so it is just right to steal billions of decent currencies from them, though it is bad to forget paying one's income tax to the British Treasury.The film is simple but effective. We kind of know from the very start who Alexander Pierce may be, but that's not important at all because what is essential is how that thief who nicely put several billions of some good currencies in his pocket directly from the coffers of a Russian Mafioso, will evade the police and escape from the real Russian gangsters.There is no depth in all that but there is a lot of fun and action. It is also so realistically critical of the world's polices that it turns funny somewhere. The English police are only interested in recuperating the income tax that was not paid. The French police are whipping other cats, as they say in French, and looking the other way. The Italian police are only attracted by the profit they can make out of selling their prisoners to the highest bidder. Only Interpol, or a couple of Interpol agents are honest, though some might already be too high a count. Only one in fact and as long as the game is funny and paid for by his authorities.The most difficult part is to convince the girlfriend that she is just doing what she has to do, according to the letters he has delivered to her regularly when there is a bend or turn along the way. Ha has spent one million dollars having his own face restructured somewhere in Brazil, or Latin America, and she does not know what he looks like any more. She is an Interpol agent and he can count on her being able to resist anything including violence and her being very creative in her actions. And she does not disappoint us, and probably not our Alexander Pierce.While she is going from one station to the next according to his instructions, he is getting close to her and observing her and getting the protection she can get from Interpol who are protecting and following her, just like a pack of dogs would follow the smell of a fox. In fact the scent is that of a vixen in this case since Interpol, or the Russian gangster do not know the scent of the fox since he has spent a fortune to change his physical parameters.And everyone will be happy. The Russian Mafiosi will be all dead, as dead as a bunch of door nails, though not enough nails to nail down their coffins. The British cops will recuperate the 744 million pounds of overdue tax money they wanted to get out of the business. The beautiful Elise will be reunited to her mysterious Alexander Pierce. Alexander Pierce will be able to sail away with no one on his tracks any more.That's a pure action film done in the best immoral tradition of the morality one can find in robbing the rich. It is their fault any way. They would not be robbed if they were not rich. Let them give everything away and follow Jesus on his way to Capharnaüm or Jerusalem. Unluckily today's rich people are not like the tax collector Matthew. They don't believe in giving their money away and they prefer losing their lives rather than not retaliating against some one who borrowed a few billions from their coffers with the intention of not bringing them back.

45,johnnyboyz,Curiously engaging procession of colourful locations and attractive stars whom are out-fancified by an uproarious narrative combining for a dumb-fun picture.,6,1 October 2011,"The Tourist is a fruity, frothy, colourful excursion into sugary Euro-centric pop thriller nonsense; a film made by a man whom appears to think he's a classical Hollywood film-maker at the peak of said era's star system employing fabulously glamorous folk to take part in extravagantly made genre pieces. It is complete baloney, but it's a good crack; a large helping of romanticism unfolding in a glamorous locale shot only like a tourist board video and consisting of two people of binary oppositions unrealistically (or is it?) attracting, coming to fall in love out of their respective differences whilst striving for a better situation away from great risk and the elements. In this sense, one could be forgiven for thinking one was watching some sort of ill-advised joke pastiche version of the 1966 William Wyler film How to Steal a Million; a film that took us to Paris and enjoyed combining romance, crime as well as danger between two affluent screen stars – The Tourist going one better and whipping us around to Venice as well as said French capital. In addition, we slot into getting behind the two lead characters, played by Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, much more easily; Jolie allowed to drive most of the proceedings and seeing her character, unlike Hepburn's in the aforementioned example, come to the forefront rather than settle back onto the sidelines thus rendering her presence superfluous as both she and her character's family's plight is on the brink of ruin.Speaking of Jolie, it is she to whom we are introduced during the opening scene; a woman named Elise under the watchful electronic eye of a surveillance van plus agents tracking her every move on this, a pleasant Parisian morning. German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck makes a point to stand Jolie out, her image and presence the unadulterated centre of the film's early sense of focus; her radiant white figure a sight amidst the greyed out, dull dress-sense of the other Paris based folk - the film using the surveillance truck to establish the scopophilic qualities Elise possess. As she walks down the streets, von Donnersmarck's 'invisible' camera is utilised so as to capture certain parts of her, legs and rear, to highlight attractiveness amidst sexualised slurs from those within the truck - at once confirming what we ought to find 'attractive' and what the consensus on the woman ought to be.At a nearby café, after an establishing of her bilingual abilities in the French and English languages, she receives a note delivered by a courier from that of a certain Alex, her long-time partner; a note informing her that she is being followed and is in danger, so must immediately board a specific train in order to find an Alex 'lookalike' and throw the authorities off the scent. Using skills of evasion, she does so – the train to the Italian city of Venice the one upon which she ends up and Johnny Depp's American high-school teacher Frank Tupelo the hapless fella' roped into having his holiday alone cut short so as to be forced into spending time with Jolie – oh, and get mistaken for a heister. Tupelo comes complete with long hair and a generally shaggy appearance, a far cry from the other suave and attractive complexion of the other men aboard the train – Tupelo seemingly a simple American lost amidst the culture, ritz and handsomeness of Western Europe; the insinuation being that he's well out of his depth.Paul Bettany plays an English Scotland Yard officer named John Acheson heading the case on catching Alex – a man already guilty of blowing eight million pounds worth of company funds on apprehending someone who's still at large. He is dismissed from the case by an angry superior, but brushes away his new duties when an assistant approaches his desk with files and papers in order to continue to piece together clues on where Elise is heading. For antagonism, look no further than Steven Berkoff's snarling, cantankerous villain; a man named Shaw, a man whom walks and lumbers around as if Frankenstein's monster constantly on some sort of pain killing drug. He gives demands; punishes those that are incompetent and enjoys throwing his weight around, a gangster who comes complete with a set of typically nasty, stock Eastern European henchmen - the likes of which he appears to have out on loan from Sean Bean's National Treasure baddie. The film spills out into the flash apartments, fancy hotels and gorgeous water-ways of Venice; cinematographer John Seale practically doing everything in his power to beautify a locale generally consisting of lapping water peppered by gondolas and the odd centuries-old bridge.The film is good fun, a thriller of some value eventually going on to resemble what might constitute as an episode in the life of that wily Japanese television serial/film franchise fan-favourite from back in the day, Lupin – a dogged character, a thief whose adventures and trials and tales would constitute the bulk of the piece. In this sense, you could say Bettany plays the Zenigata to Alex's Lupin; the guy always on his trail but never in the position to put him away, whereas Berkoff makes for a tasty, sadistic villain in the mould of the titular Cagliostro castle Count out of that respective feature. Jolie, to some extent riffing the Fujiko Mine character, is enjoyable and the connection we feel between both her and Depp works well. In spite of its generally cold reception, I found it difficult to get upset about The Tourist; a bubble-gum thriller inside of a fanciful looking wrapper which does not prematurely loose its taste.",The Tourist
46,filipemanuelneto,It could have been a great movie and it was not.,4,15 February 2017,"This movie could be so much better than it turned out! The story tells of a lonely American tourist who gets involved with a mysterious and beautiful woman, who will drag him to a police imbroglio in order to protect her lover, who is a wanted criminal. The main location of the film is the eternal and addictive Venice, with its beautiful canals and palaces. But a beautiful landscape does not make a movie. The two main actors were Johnnie Depp and Angelina Jolie, two consecrated and proved stars. But both he and her seemed constantly so theatrical, with modes and dialogues affected and literary, that never proved comfortable with the characters and the film. They looked like what they are: actors playing characters. I don't even need to mention that they were not capable of creating a romantic chemistry among themselves. Jolie still had an additional problem: the very elaborate and chic wardrobe she wore constantly. She was beautiful, its true, but she still seemed a lot like herself, not to mention that her clothes could catch our attention faster than the actress's talent (an indisputable talent, no one doubts it, she just could not use it, neither Depp). Can we blame the script? Partly. All film is very theatrical and forced, the script is naturally part of it, but the great guilty is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, director and screenwriter. He's not a very good director, he's not very experienced and he still has a lot to improve. I'm not sure what he wanted to do in this movie but he totally failed at whatever he wanted to see done.

47,leplatypus,A Tourist Year for Angie (screen),1,2 January 2011,"In french, to be called a tourist at work means that you are not very productive because you just don't care about your task (I was labeled like this by a previous boss but as she was really a pervert, I don't think it counts and above all, this isn't the story here...).In all cases, for Angie, 2010 was a blank year because her movies are really forgettable. ""Salt"" was idiot and ""The tourist"" isn't better. Now, i give my short list of disappointments: 1) Why do Hollywood stars don't let their body and look natural because the more they change, the more they are ugly? Here, Deep has his face stretched like a piano wire and Angie is close to anorexia (thus forbidding her new action movies like ""Tomb Raider""?) 2) Why do Hollywood movies kept focusing about rich people? I am tired to always see wealthy people, being happy with expensive clothes and jewels when they are just a little fraction of the people? I don't think that all American tourists visiting Venizia are dressed like Deep thus I can't identify with the character.3) Some facts are just plainly wrong: Living in Paris, you can never be stuck at the subway entrance; If Angie is so cautious to burn the paper, why does she left before its entire destruction? I am very doubtful that a burnt paper could be used to read after.4) I don't understand if the bad guy is Russian or English and why as usual, his hired men are dumb and useless to execute his orders? 5) It's very unlikely that the police are unable to identify the cheater (not a single picture of him?) and it's even more impossible that he can change his identity beyond recognition by his lover or past boss!Well, the magic of Angie is fading away at fast speed. The only good moment of the movie was the song ""Starlight"" performed by Muse .... but as it's at the end credits, it's a bit too late.",The Tourist
48,TheMovieDiorama,The Tourist contains light escapism in a convoluted pedestrian plot.,4,15 September 2018,"Mainstream short thrillers that do not require much concentration are fine for passing time, and can make for an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately for this star-studded flick, the tonal inconsistencies embedded within a ludicrous yet predictable story can't elevate itself above the rest, thus instantly becoming forgettable. Governmental agencies follow an enigmatic woman, who's beauty captivates all, as she attempts to fool them into believing a civilian is a world-class criminal. The inner and outer luxury of Venice is beautifully captured, with both the residents and architecture exhuming glamour and elegance. Jolie is mesmerisingly stunning as she activates Lara Croft mode for a mismatched British accent (again). Depp is a handsome fellow, with such a rugged poise and sharp smoulder that it would stop any Venetian in their tracks (even if he is doing his Jack Sparrow run across rooftops). The flamboyant score complements the idyllic scenery with such richness that it can only be best described as eating ""scampi risotto"" in a fine dining restaurant. Beautiful, just beautiful. All that beauty...for nothing. How best to describe this film? Is it a comedy? Thriller? Mystery? Drama? Romance? Perhaps all of the above? There are so many genre strands intertwined together, that the frequent shifts in tone make for a disorientating film. Then the primary focus on Jolie and Depp feels slightly self-indulgent as they hardly act at all, which feels frustrating when Bettany and Dalton deserve better. The mystery behind the plot can be quickly deciphered during the first ten minutes, which makes the final reveal underwhelming. Considering the film relies on this twist, it is therefore deemed as a failure in whatever genre you choose to put this in. This is even without mentioning the one-dimensional characters and non-existent development. So it does provide light escapism amidst a beautiful city, but that's about it. You would be better off touring a different thriller.",The Tourist

50,jzappa,"That's Fine, Mr. von Donnersmarck. Isn't That Pretty. Now Clear Up Your Playthings and Get On With It.",6,7 January 2011,"Imagine if Alfred Hitchcock had not died in 1980. Imagine he'd lived 30 years longer. Don't imagine The Tourist is a masterpiece by a long shot, but that Hitchcock---so utterly confident in his formula of streamlined suspense, an everyman ensnared in a web of intrigue, a statuesque mystery woman, a clockwork thriller plot constructed out of chases, procedures, deceptions and glamorous locations, offset by a tongue-in-cheek vibe---not having changed his tune with the times in his final working days, would've simply continued making his brand. That's The Tourist. It's not just Hitchcockian. It's Hitchcock.It starts right off with the police chasing Grace Kell---er, Angelina Jolie, as she deceives her way onto a train and seduces Cary Grant a.k.a. Johnny Depp into being an unknowing decoy in her complex plan to elude the authorities and a mobster that spans a chase through Paris and Venice. Hitchcock loved his Wrong Man heroes to be unlikely everyday joes, salesmen, musicians, dentists, and Depp is a milquetoast math teacher from Wisconsin, the accommodating, smitten straight man who finds himself compacted into somebody else's predicament, delivering bone-dry humor in his attempt to reason with authorities and villains, the role Grant invented.The film's rife with clichés and predictable at every turn. Both leads exert themselves gracefully in pursuits over the rooftops of Venice, casino scenes, designer gowns and a chase through the canals with Jolie at the reins of a motor taxi without smearing their makeup or mussing their hair. Their relationship goes where the script instructs. All actors are masked in the shade of their prototypes. The music swells in romantic scenes that reek of corn, cheese and syrup. But there's an unapologetic tone to it all. It winks at us rather than implying that we're supposed to be taking any of it seriously. Jolie and Depp meet on a train virtually wearing signboards reading ""NORTH BY NORTHWEST."" Perhaps on the back, they say ""THE LADY VANISHES."" The script in general is nothing more than a retread of The 39 Steps or Saboteur. Some have argued it's the up-to-the-minute counterpart of Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief, which can't say it isn't.It bothers me when critics say a plot twist invalidates their emotional investment in a story when they earlier impart that they were uninvolved in a soulless, phoned-in film. If movies with inside-out plot twists insult audiences so much, why do audiences love these films and critics don't? I think it's critics, who seek professions designed to imply that they're so intelligent that they're who we must refer to for information and counsel, who perceive plot twists as slights against their self-image of wisdom.The icing on that rather unattractive cake is that this particular case-in-point is the precise opposite of a film for which you must remember to bring your brain before going in. It merely drifts with bemusement above the absurd. However where I do agree with this film's critical bashing is my disappointment that in a year of mostly frivolous trash that makes no effort to earn unproblematic commercial success and a handful of fantastic films that fight tooth and nail for your attention, an assembly of endowed actors and filmmakers collaborate at the peak of their capabilities and generate something of such pure froth as this silky, sweetened, amusingly vain prance.You'd never suppose that von Donnersmarck also helmed the Oscar-winning The Lives of Others. Not just in subject matter but in quality. It's imitation where it should be clever, ineffective where it should be sexy. It dawdles while watching extras watching farcically plastic-fashion-doll gorgeous Jolie do her runway swagger, her famed lips puckered just so. She's so frigid that she appears more like an uncannily elegant space alien. And above all, the movie's soundtracked within an inch of its life. All that aside, it's all quite commonplace as far as filmmaking goes. Perhaps except for that von Donnersmarck, who shot so claustrophobically in The Lives of Others, does know how to shoot wide to portray splendor and richness as well as action.I probably sound like a hypocrite, having done a 180 from praising its perpetuation of the unsullied Hitchcock chase thriller to censuring it for being disappointing and dull, but the truth is that viewing it as a pure Hitchcock thriller is the one way I can imagine being entertained by the film. As is the consensus, it's a romantic thriller on the more frivolous side, worthwhile enough for those disposed to play along, but those disposed are either Hitchcock fans or extremely generous to what they make it to the theaters for. Like the unrelentingly aforementioned Hitchcock thrillers, it's escapist fun for rigorous times, but unlike those films, it has none of the technique that keeps you riveted and excited nonstop throughout and instead functions like a wind-up doll that only has the personality you expect it to have on the most rudimentary level. And considering its director's previous work is a masterpiece of subtle building up of details, layers of emotional texture, presenting a decisive mastery of tone and character transformation, and that its writers are both deserving winners of the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for such tours de force as The Usual Suspects and Gosford Park, that is quite understandably depressing to those who go to movies seeking more than watchable if unremarkable exercises and elaborate sundaes, brews of sugary pleasures and barren calories.",The Tourist
51,robert-temple-1,Lavish Venetian locations and well-crafted entertainment film,7,27 April 2011,"This amusing and entertaining film was directed by a German count named Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, famous for his previous feature film, THE LIVES OF OTHERS (2007), and who is six feet eight inches tall! Even allowing for the fact that German aristocrats are traditionally very tall, and I have met several of both sexes who are six feet three or four, Henckel seems to have over-done it. No wonder the Romans had such a hard time fighting the ancient German warriors! They could not reach high enough to try and chop their heads off! Henckel is a highly sophisticated man of the world, who speaks many languages, and such expertise shows in his use of Venice as a location for this film. I have never seen Venice so well exploited cinematically. Venice is a notoriously difficult place to shoot, not only because of the astronomical costs and charges, but because of union troubles, the usual Italian corruption, and countless bureaucratic and other obstacles. So despite being the world's most beautiful city, it has always been greatly under-used as a film location. The Danieli Hotel seems to have offered itself as a location gladly, and this must have increased their clientele enormously. We are even informed in the dialogue that the Doge's Suite, where Angelina Jolie stays, was the home away from home of Marcel Proust and Honoré de Balzac when they were writing their novels. Come on, Henckel, that's showing off! Johnny Depp plays a hapless mathematics teacher from Wisconsin (yes, that's right, Wisconsin!) whom glamour gal Angelina meets on a train from Paris to Venice when she is searching for someone the same size as her lost lover, to make police spies think he is her lover following his plastic surgery. (The lover has stolen $2.3 billion, so is quite a player.) Depp is superb at looking baffled and pathetic, which brings a wonderful touch of humour to the proceedings. Angelina is her usual commanding presence, with one detail gone wrong this time. In this film, her eye makeup is simply too much! Talk about over the top! Either the makeup girl should be fired, or Angelina insisted on this herself because she believes too much in mirrors, but whoever is to blame the German warrior should have said no to it. After all, when you're six feet eight inches tall, you can get your way if you try. Angelina should never have been allowed to let herself look like that. And her lips were too glossy as well. Someone needs to tell her this is all over-kill and she should cool it. This false note grates against the nerves, when one is appreciating all the good taste of the sets and locations and Angelina's otherwise stately progress through this story, as she carries herself like the perfect grande dame, confident in her appeal. The story is of course nonsense, but is meant to be. Nothing is convincing, and the very outrageous and improbable nature of every plot element is all part of the fun. As we watch this film, we are not disturbed by its impossibility at every turn. Instead, we follow the nonsense with perfect equanimity and appreciation, just sitting back and drinking it all in like a glass of good vintage burgundy.",The Tourist

53,jtindahouse,Tripe and these two know it,5,13 August 2011,"I'm a huge Depp fan. I'm a huge Jolie fan. I however, can not stand The Tourist. Just so very little going for it. At no stage, and even now, are we even sure what the point of the film we're watching is. Are we supposed to be rooting for Jolie and Depp's romance? Or are we just hoping all characters involved survive all the attempts at their life by the people searching for Alexander Pearce? Are we just trying to work out who Pearce is? Or is it all of the above?The problems start with the complete lack of chemistry between Depp and Jolie (what the entire film basically relies on). I read that Jolie quoted about this film that she did it because it was to be a ""quick shoot in Venice"" which I took to mean her heart wasn't really in it. And it shows. Depp's a great actor and he brings his natural charm to this film at times but it's not enough to save what is, put simply, a dull character with not much going for him. I was shocked when I learned that they'd both been nominated for best actor/actress at the Golden Globes. So you can imagine my even greater shock when I realized it had been nominated for best film as well. What exactly went on here I wonder? There's obviously a plot and a story which I won't bother to go into, suffice to say it's predictable, seen a thousand times before and boring quite frankly. The reason I won't bother to explain the problems of the plot is because it's not what the film relies on. They thought they could carry a substandard plot with big A-list actors. They were wrong.The Tourist fails in all aspects. It can't even get away with being a guilty pleasure because it's dull. It's a shame really because these two, had they committed, and with a better script perhaps could've made something really enjoyable to watch. Maybe they'll collaborate again one day, though probably not, and we'll get to see what they were really capable of. But for now we'll just have to wonder what could have been.",The Tourist
54,Turfseer,Clever twist ending is not enough to save suspenseless Venice snoozefest,4,2 September 2021,"Since his 2006 Oscar winning The Lives of Others, Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has come out with two additional features. One of them was his epic drama from 2018, Never Look Away. The other is our film under discussion today, The Tourist in 2010. Why did von Donnersmarck decide to get involved in such a poor film in contrast to the two other critically acclaimed ones?The first thought that comes to mind is that he simply did it for the money. But according to von Donnersmarck, he was quoted as explaining that he wanted to do something a bit lighter to get away from the intensity of his first picture.The Tourist has as its template a James Bond film. But it's nowhere as suspenseful or witty as some of the better Bond entries. Director von Donnersmarck claimed that he was more inclined to classify The Tourist as a comedy than a straight suspense thriller. I'm not sure if that's correct because they're really aren't any amusing bits here either.The plot isn't that complicated. Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie) is being pursued by both the police from Scotland Yard led by Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) and a brutal gangster Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff). Both men believe that Elise (who was in a year long relationship with Alexander Pearce who stole $2.3 billion from Shaw and owes 744 million pounds to the British government) will lead them to Pearce.Act I begins with Elise receiving a note from Pearce while dining in an outdoor café in Paris, instructing her to take a bullet train to Venice, Italy, meet up with a stranger on the train and let the police believe she's meeting Pearce. Elise selects an ordinary schlub, Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp), a mathematics teacher at a Wisconsin Community College. A principal caveat is that no one knows what Pearce looks like because he paid millions to a plastic surgeon to alter his appearance.Act 2 is really one big extended chase scene after another. Along the way there is a twist: Elise is actually an undercover police officer working for Scotland Yard. Frank is first pursued by Shaw's men after fleeing the fancy hotel room where he was staying with Elise in Venice. After he is captured by the Italian police, a corrupt inspector turns him over to Shaw's men, but Elise rescues him in a speedboat in one of the Venice canals (interestingly enough von Donnersmarck was not permitted to do a high speed chase in Venice, so he changed the script to have Elise drag Frank while he's chained inside another boat and through the canal itself!).The second half of Act II is set at a ball where Frank proclaims his love for Elise but is taken into protective custody by the police in order not to interfere with the sting operation to capture Shaw. Elise ends up in the clutches of Shaw who demands she open up a safe where he believes Pearce has placed the purloined billions.Naturally Frank is able to escape from police custody and shows up to save Elise. When Shaw threatens to disfigure her with a knife it looks like Frank is doomed since he appears not to have the combination to the safe. Acheson, expecting Pearce to show up anytime, nixes his snipers from killing Shaw. But at the last minute, Acheson's superior shows up, countermands his orders and has the snipers take out Shaw and his goons.The Tourist is almost saved by a clever twist ending where we discover that the man the police thought was Pearce is an ordinary British tourist being paid by the real Pearce to impersonate him. Instead we discover Frank is actually Pearce as we see that he was able to open the safe, leave a check for his tax debt, make off with the balance of the money he stole from Shaw and ""ride off into the sunset"" with Elise!It's a film that virtually has no character development with the director and producers believing that the scenic shots in Venice are enough to compensate for any limitations of the narrative. Unfortunately the Venice vistas aren't enough to save this virtually suspenseless ""comedy"" thriller.I fail to see why people so admire Angelina Jolie given her horrible makeup and stiff acting (I suspect that her acting is stiff because of the way she carries herself-there is nothing soft or gentle about her; rather she exudes a confirmed aura of rigidity). Not much can be said for Depp either whose role as a lovesick puppy dog impersonator fails to impress.The Tourist is a remake of the French film Anthony Zimmer. I'm curious to see that one. Meanwhile who will remember the remake at all? I suspect very few people, as it has already been relegated (I believe) to the dustbins of cinematic history.",The Tourist
55,DarkVulcan29,Surprisingly entertaining,8,13 December 2010,"Okay it was not has good as this summers Knight and Day. But I was amused by the unique story it was trying to tell, Johnny Depp and Anjelina Jolie chemistry was not that great, I mean in some scene it was there, other scenes it wasn't. It was like those spy thrillers of yesterday like North by Northwest(1959) and Three days of the Condor(1975). Co stars Paul Betthany and Timothy Dalton don't disappoint either. If you are in the mood for a charming spy thriller, then give The Tourists a look.The story begins with a beautiful British socialite Elise(Angelina Jolie) who is living in France, who is in love with thief named Pierce, who is on the run after stealing money from a big time gangster. And is being tracked by the mod, and by a police captain(Paul Betthany), one day while at a café, she gets a letter from him, telling her to take a train, finds some guy who is the same height and build, in hopes to throw the cops and the mob off. She finds that within Frank(Johnny Depp) a math teacher who is a tourists. And what happens next, you'll half to see the movie to find out.",The Tourist
56,ebiros2,Clever Story,7,4 February 2012,"The story without giving it away, reminds me of Thomas Crown Affair, except that the focus is not an object but a person. And I liked the two main protagonists in this movie more than either of the TCA movies.The movie is bit boring in the beginning because you don't see the clever plot that it's setting you up for. You'd be thinking ""Where is this all leading to ?"". Then as Frank (Johnny Depp) gets more involved with trouble, the story becomes more interesting, until Pierce finally appears in person.The movie is beautifully made, and shot in Venice. Angelina Jolie looks beautiful in this movie. The production is first class with beautiful scenery at every turn.Perhaps the low rating is due to the impatience in the audience's part not to see it to the end. Watch this movie til the end and you will be pleasantly surprised at the outcome.",The Tourist
57,dfranzen70,"Pretty, but tortuous and unsatisfying",5,1 January 2012,"The Tourist, to be blunt, is malarkey dressed up like the belle of the ball. The first hour or so seems to move quickly, until you realize that nothing has really happened to further the plot in a coherent manner, and it quickly devolves into a quagmire of overcomplications and double crosses, culminating in an ending that strives to be all things to all people and fails at being much of anything. It's a pretty film with pretty actors doing a pretty good job, and that's about it. Johnny Depp plays Frank Tupelo, the titular traveler who has an ""accidental"" interaction with a femme fatale named Elise Clifton-Ward, played by the ever-luminous Angelina Jolie. Thankfully, for once Jolie doesn't play a Lara Croft character who is Just Plain Awesome at everything; her Elise is certainly more worldly and in command than Depp's Frank, but she's not necessarily a superwoman/robot, if such a thing existed. (I think it does.) Elise involves Frank in an intricate spy-versus-spy plot in which he's unwittingly being tapped to impersonate her husband, who's wanted by gangsters, Scotland Yard, Interpol, and probably his local library. Because Elise is so outlandishly gorgeous, Frank just dumbly goes along with it. I don't blame him for it. He follows her around, does what she says. If Angelina Jolie told me to come with her to an expensive hotel in Venice, I could definitely see myself giving it careful consideration, for sure.Unlike many other movies in which the protagonists race around wildly from gorgeous locale to gorgeous locale, pausing only to make out a little bit here and there, this one has the twist – using that loosely – that Elise's husband hasn't been seen in a long time and is presumed to have changed his appearance through extensive surgery. So you can see how Depp can just step in and fill his shoes.If you watch this movie, you'll be enraptured with the lead performances and little else. Depp plays clueless rather well, and Jolie is probably the Elizabeth Taylor of her generation. Taylor always seemed to be known first as a pretty face with unbelievable violet eyes and then as a damn fine actress. Jolie's the same in many respects. I don't think she knows how to phone in a performance. Okay, maybe The Bone Collector. Anyway, at least she gets to don several beautiful, expensive outfits.The ending just doesn't feel right, either. It sort of makes you feel as if you've been had, and that's the worst kind of ending: a gyp. These spy movies can be complex, wheels-within-wheels ordeals, but that can work if the little details you overlook at first add up to something in the end. If you get a complex story that winds up being made out of papier-mache, then it's a sad, unfit ending. This is the kind of movie whose ending makes you slap your face with a ""Oh, THAT's what I get?"" That's not a compliment.",The Tourist
58,PWNYCNY,Lots of fluff but entertaining.,8,11 December 2010,"Of course, for obvious reasons, the top billed stars for this movie are Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, and their performances are wonderful. Mr. Depp is suave and at times amusing and Ms. Jolie is, as always, absolutely ravishing. She is stunning. The movie contains repeated close-ups of her face. The movie is about her. Yet, the real star of this movie, the person who generates the energy to carry this movie through, is Steven Berkoff. Mr. Berkoff's performance alone is worth the price of admission. This movie is a virtual lesson on how to play a villain. Whenever the movie is on the verge of dragging, Mr. Berkoff's energetic presence keeps the movie on track. Although the story is transparent and there is little to suggest anything other than fluff, still the movie is entertaining and sustains enough interest to keep an audience engaged. As a comic actor, Johnny Depp definitely excels and although teamed with Ms. Jolie he succeeds in maintaining a screen presence. As for Ms. Jolie, she is charming, beautiful, and a delight to watch.",The Tourist
59,st-shot,"Pretty faces, pretty lame.",2,10 December 2010,"This ugly little piece of slam dunk marketing featuring present day reigning sex symbols Angelina Jolie and Johnnny Depp in a tepid suspensor revolving around missing cash is a clunker from the get go. It's all face time for the hotties which I surmise are supposed to turn up the heat based on their good looks alone since the vapid plot and predictable pursuers lack even a scintilla of originality or suspense. It is a cynical cash grab by all involved. As Fats Waller would say ""all that meat and no potatoes.""Woman of mystery Elise Ward (Jolie) boards a train bound for Venice where she enlists Frank Tupelo (Depp) as a useful idiot to help her elude the law and the mob to rendezvous with an accomplice who has made off with an obscene amount of money. The chase is on but the pace along with just about everything else is off.Jolie has a mega fatale look but her dialog is trite and she delivers it with a comatose inflection that more or less says, with a face and body like this whose listening? She's more runway model in the middle of a show than character of intrigue morphing at times into a stunning and stilted statue. Depp looks bored and non-committal with his rube appointed resume (Wisconsin math teacher) and scruffy look that suaves up in time to get into a clinch with Ms. Jolie, nearly matching her lifelessness. Director Florian von Donnersmark is a major disappointment. The Tourist is his follow-up to one of the finest films of this early century, Other Peoples Lives and the drop off in cinematic skill and suspense is equivalent to falling off of Everest. Lives, a sober but suspenseful crafted work dealing with the dreaded Stasi in drab East Germany was everything this sloppy escapist drivel isn't. Bad career choice or one hit wonder von Donnermark has only this to show output wise over the last four years and it's downright ghostly. The Tourist is one bad trip of a movie that smugly attempts to overwhelm you with its stars and locale while paying cursory attention to story, detail and substance. It is a callous, bland product example of producer condescension for an audience that will settle for the crumbs of something that looks great but runs lousy. It should do just fine at the box office.",The Tourist
60,estebangonzalez10,I was entertained with The Tourist,7,30 December 2010,"¨Why is everyone trying to kill me? ¨ The Tourist hasn't had a very good reception with the critics so somehow I went into this expecting it would be terrible. I had heard Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie had real bad chemistry together, but I was surprised that I actually enjoyed this film quite a bit and thought their performance was great. I can't recall one bad movie Johnny Depp has made lately, he seems to always bring a new and different look every time and his charisma always comes through to make him likable or at least give the viewers an entertaining time. Angelina Jolie was as beautiful as ever and not only turned the head of every person in the movie, but also left the viewers awe struck. I guess many people were disappointed because they expected more from such a talented cast, but I got more than what I was expecting and was very entertained throughout the film with the action and comedy. Depp and Jolie weren't terrible together and I thought their chemistry was very believable. The main problem with The Tourist is the plot and screenplay (written by von Donnersmarck, McQuarrie, and Fellowes) which is very unbelievable at times, but the actors and the beautiful European scenery make this a very entertaining film. I wouldn't have nominated it as Best Movie in the Golden Globes, but it isn't terrible either. I'm pretty sure it won't win anyway, the nomination was a bit too much, but the awful criticism it has received is way too unfair.The plot is pretty simple and as I said before it isn't the strong point of the film. Johnny Depp plays Frank Tupelo, a widowed math professor from the States who is visiting Venice on his own. During a train ride he runs into the lovely Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie) who hits on him right away. The catch is that Elise has an agenda of her own. She has a romantic affair with Alexander, an accountant for a mobster who has stolen over two billion dollars from him and has disappeared for the last two years. The Interpol and the mobsters are searching for him and they know that Elise is the only person who can lead them to him. After two years of silence, Elise has received a note from Alexander asking her to meet him in Venice and on the way choose someone about his height to mislead police officials; hence Elise seduces Frank so officials think he is Alexander. Frank ends up getting into trouble running from the Interpol and the mobsters who are set to kill him, and Elise realizes things have gone too far so she decides to help him. The movie mixes comedy with action and it does it very well thanks to the cast and not the material they have to work with. There are several plot twists that may result a little unbelievable, but the movie still makes for an entertaining time. I have to admit the scenery also helped quite a bit.The plot may sound a little familiar for some people, especially if you have seen the 2005 French Film Anthony Zimmer, staring Sophie Marceau (ex Bond girl) and directed by Jerome Salle. The Tourist is actually a remake of that movie and they're usually not well conceived in Hollywood so maybe that is one reason why critics hated it so much. The other reason might be that a lot more was expected from director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who was following up on his highly successful German Oscar award winning film, The Lives of Others (which ranks at number 57 in the IMDb top 250 films of all time). He had set the bar very high, because that film was truly a masterpiece and The Tourist can't even be compared at that level. Do not expect too much from this movie, and if you do so you might just end up enjoying this film for its star power, but be warned the plot and screenplay are very week. I have to admit I had a very good time with The Tourist, the last film of the year I will see.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Tourist

The movie was shot in the beautiful city of Venice and the great cinematography has added to the beauty of the location but movie still doesn't offers much.Acting is the only and the most strongest department of the movie.

62,kluseba,The power of charming art and tranquillity,8,24 December 2010,"This movie is nothing very intense or groundbreaking, but a very entertaining and easy to watch film with amazing footages, a very good acting and a well developed plot that is a little bit predictable but still entertaining.The best thing about the movie is without a doubt the way it is filmed. I really loved the footages of the movie. The director has a very talented way to capture landscapes, surroundings and place its actors into the whole scenery. If you are interested in European style, clothes and culture, this movie has some beautiful fashion, some beautiful buildings and monuments to offer.Concerning the acting, I think that the smart and soft relationship between the shy and silent Johnny Depp and the dominating femme fatale Angelina Jolie is very credible. Usually, I think that Jolie is an overrated actress and I also think that she didn't do an extremely profound or talented job once again in here, but she works well in combination with Johnny Depp who is much more credible and fits this role.The story line seems to be a little bit confusing in the beginning but in the end, everything is explained in a very logical, romantic and twisted way. I think that the big twist in the end was easily predictable but that didn't do any harm to the charm and entertainment of the movie. There were some average action scenes, a little bit of tension and a little bit of humour that created an very entertaining and diversified mixture and concentrated on a charming atmosphere like in an old fashioned romantic bourgeoisie movie. This movie is something for expert of arts, experts of old fashioned romantic movies with some slightly crime influences and fans of Johnny Depp. The force of the movie is its decent and shy tranquillity. But you should not expect an intense thriller or tragical drama. It is more a character or footage movie with a beautiful acting. It is easy to consume and very entertaining but nothing innovating or groundbreaking.I really appreciated to watch the movie and got a perfect entertainment. But I admit that the combination of Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie could have created something more intense and profound that would have been worth an unforgettable blockbuster. But that's clearly not what the writers, directors and actors wanted and this unconventional and alternative style is a fresh breathe and can be seen as a positive or negative surprise. To me, it was a positive event. It's up to everyone to judge if he likes that kind of movie or not and I think that my critic is neutral and descriptive enough to give you an idea of what you might expect.",The Tourist

This movie had really good visuals, as far as costumes and sets, very elegant. I personally thought the dialouge was pretty intelligent. The ending was a big shocker, one of those that made you step back and question the entire movie. I'm not going to give away what is in store, you'll have to find that out on your own.

64,3xHCCH,Unexpectedly Entertaining - It's Not That Bad!,6,1 February 2011,"There had been so many bad reviews about The Tourist, I did not want to watch it at all despite the unprecedented partnership of Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie. I did not want to be disappointed, especially after those snide remarks about their bribed Golden Globe nominations. However, when I actually heard a good review from someone, I decided to give it a chance to see what the real score is about this film.The first thing you notice about The Tourist is it's slick shiny look. It was like a James Bond film with extra shine. Angelina Jolie had that unreal femme fatale look as Elise Clifton-Ward, with her ultra-glamorous dresses and hairstyles. She is being tailed by the police in search for a man named Alexander whom we would surmise is her lover. As instructed by Alexander in a note, Elise takes a train to Venice to meet him. However, to distract the police, she should first pick a person on the train with Alexander's height and built. That is where Wisconsin professor Frank Tupelo (an worn-out looking Johnny Depp) comes in, setting up this twisty story of action, comedy and romance.I can't say that I did not see the final twist coming, and yes, the plot is quite shallow. But you know what, since I watched this film expecting it to totally suck, I actually enjoyed its preposterousness and sense of humor. Sometimes the stars are too big, or the director is award-winning (in this case, Florian von Donnersmark of the amazing ""The Lives of Others"") that we get unrealistic expectations. That was why The Tourist disappointed so many people. I liked the elegant locales and the very good-looking cast. It is not above poking fun at its stars, like those scenes where all the bystanders staring in awe as Angelina passed by. I thought Johnny actually deserved his Golden Globe nomination here, instead of his grotesque turn in Alice in Wonderland. It isn't that bad. You may actually be entertained, as I was.",The Tourist
65,EUyeshima,All Glammed Up and No Place to Go But Venice,4,21 January 2011,"I get what director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (""The Lives of Others"") is trying to achieve with this stylishly ludicrous 2010 romantic thriller. It's an homage to the glamorous movies that Stanley Donen directed back in the 1960's like ""Charade"" (Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn) and ""Arabesque"" (Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren) which featured two attractive film stars at the peak of their allure in games of deception usually ensnared in an even bigger web of espionage. Perhaps because of his musical comedy background (""Singin' in the Rain""), Donen had a light touch that worked perfectly to set the tone of those classics. On the other hand, von Donnersmarck in only his second directorial effort displays a far more literal style that is anything but frothy, and sadly seems at odds with the soufflé touch this film badly needs to make it true escapist fare. He co-wrote the twisty, preposterous screenplay with two masters of the mystery genre, Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") and Julian Fellowes (""Gosford Park""), and the film boasts the requisite star power with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie.But something just doesn't feel right about the whole venture, and it may be a case of too many cooks in the kitchen waiting for their paychecks. Looking every inch the glamorous movie star, Jolie plays a mystery woman named Elise Ward who is being trailed by the French police working in cahoots with Scotland Yard. She receives a note from her former lover Alexander Pearce at a sidewalk café instructing her to take a train to Venice, find a stranger that looks just like him, and convince the police that the stranger is Pearce. Elise finds Pearce's doppelganger-to-be in Frank Tupelo, a meek math teacher from Wisconsin, and the chase begins in earnest as Elise reveals to Frank that Pearce stole two billion dollars from a surly gangster and is wanted for tax evasion by the police. The film feels like a series of heavily orchestrated set pieces meant to dazzle but only succeed in sputtering into incredulity, especially a sluggish boat chase in Venice's Grand Canal, the water of which looks ridiculously pristine. The ending is basically on par with Pam finding Bobby in the shower at the end of Season 8 of ""Dallas"" and just as convincing.Dressed to the nines by Colleen Atwood and immaculately made up, Jolie looks stunning and acts as best she can like she is the star of one of Donen's movies, but Depp is strangely at sea in his Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart everyman role. Without a layer of makeup and his standard set of eccentricities, the actor flounders in an oddly blank-faced manner that makes Elise's attraction to Frank all the more puzzling despite his blind acts of puppy-dog devotion. A strong supporting cast has been assembled but given little to do beyond looking exasperated or confused - Paul Bettany as an inspector obsessed with capturing Pearce, Timothy Dalton as the chief inspector, Steven Berkoff as the merciless gangster, and Rufus Sewell as the mysterious stranger the police try to trail. Venice looks as inviting as it did in David Lean's ""Summertime"" through John Seale's lens, especially the glorious Hotel Danieli where Frank and Elise steal a kiss that sets the police after him. It's too bad that the chemistry between the two stars playing them is so wan.",The Tourist

67,Samiam3,Lost in Venice,5,18 March 2011,"I don't think anyone involved in the Tourist has any idea of what kind of exactly it is they wish to accomplish. The studio probably wants to make some hot s**t, but director Florian von Donnersmark, seems more interested in keeping it refined and subtle. Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, just go wherever the contrivances of an underwritten screenplay take them. Perhaps if Brad Pitt was in Depp's shoes we would have gotten something good. Blame the movie on whoever you want, but the Tourist fails mostly because nobody seems to care.The lack of enthusiasm involved is astonishing. Why for instance is a speedboat chase scene through the Venitian canals moving at five miles an hour, why is there no chemistry between two leads. Considering their talent (not their stardom) is is unacceptable that they won't bother to even fake it. When they play to the cameras, you can almost sense that the two of them openly hate each other in the way that two high profile stars sometimes do when they have to share top credits. Jolie is Okay, but Depp is dreadful. Perhaps it's just too strait and tired a role for the guy who was born to wear gold teeth, or scissor hands and do wonders.the plot is dumb from the beginning, but the ending is almost offensively cheap. then again it's hard to be offended by something you never really cared for to begin with.

Pitting together two of the most iconic modern day actors in one movie and having them deliver a performance which is so devoid of chemistry and fire, as if the both Depp and Jolie were in a freezer during each scene they play together. Shocking! Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (of ""Das Leben der Anderen"" fame) delivers a veritable train-wreck, which fails to get going due to some absolutely terrifying disconnection between our two main protagonists.Now separately Johnny Depp is quite good. And even manages to deliver some funny lines, but irrespective of that this is by far his poorest performance to date. But at least he remains credible throughout and never dinks below a certain distinguishable level. Unlike Angelina Jolie, which delivers several lines with cringe-worthy ineptitude. Secondary characters don't really up the ante, as they fit into the cardboard cut-outs without conviction to deliver some unmemorable performances. Apparently the tourists on this movie were the combined cast.Not all has to be blamed on the cast, as the scriptwriters had a couple dozen too many off-days, delivers several indisputably poor moments throughout. One of them key (regarding the choice of Frank Tupelo) to making ends meet. The movie throughout lacks consistency and the plot twists in the final scenes are just poorly constructed and - although relatively predictable - collide with previous scenes of the movie.

74,Troy_Campbell,How is this not cinematic gold?,4,18 December 2010,"You would be extremely hard pressed to name two stars bigger than Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp working in Hollywood right now. Jolie's long been known as the sexiest actress on the planet whilst Depp features at the top of both fans and critics' lists alike, mine included. So their partnering up for a lusty, European-set thriller noir could only be cinematic gold, right? Sadly not. This match made in heaven turns out to be a complete and utter dud.Somehow these two Tinseltown heavyweights share zero chemistry. When they're together the fireworks go off about as much as they would if Martin Short was getting it on with Rosie O'Donnell. Separately they retain their natural charisma to a better degree. Mrs Pitt could play the femme fatale in her sleep and her role as Elise requires nothing more than seductive glances and looking ravishing (or ravenous as Frank puts it in one of the funnier moments) in an assortment of evening gowns. Conversely, Depp's maths teacher is a subtler, more grounded version of Captain Sparrow, complete with naïve kookiness and affable charm.The romantic spark between the leading couple isn't the only thing missing though. Smooth direction, witty dialogue and decent supporting characters – Paul Bettany and Stephen Berkoff are reduced to one-dimensional stereotypes – are all non-existent. The man in charge, von Donnersmarck (who made the critically applauded The Lives of Others), handles the action with a mood-deadening approach, turning potentially tense chase scenes into lack-lustre and shallow sequences. Even aerial shots of Venice miss the mark, one particular shot features a nice large crane at the centre of it. Would it have been too difficult to remove the crane utilising CGI? David Fincher perfectly recreated the Port of San Francisco (in Zodiac) that only those with better than 20-20 vision would've noticed wasn't real, so surely digitally removing the crane wouldn't have busted the budget.It's with no surprise that I learn von Donnersmarck also wrote the screenplay, apparently his clunky direction began long before the cameras even rolled. The dialogue constantly misfires and the plot unravels predictably and pretentiously. How the character of 'The Englishman' (curiously played by Rufus Sewell) is written into the story is downright pathetic and lazy beyond belief. What I was completely bemused by though is that Christopher McQuarrie was also on scripting duties. There's absolutely no sign of the cleverness he displayed in his Oscar winning screenplay for The Usual Suspects.I left the cinema scratching my head. How the creative team behind this managed to make a dull and derivative movie with two of the hottest stars of our generation is a mystery.2 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Average, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",The Tourist

Although Von Donnersmarck and his co-writers have won Academy Awards for their skills I'd say this time they failed to show danger, suspense, and intrigue, which are instrumental and (all) basic elements of a truly effective thriller. But there's no danger over here, no suspense either, but a ridiculous ""twist"" spotted so early. And the whole intrigue is weakened by the quantity of disbelief the audience has to put up with. The most beautiful thing is the impressive location, a postcard scenery of Venice. However the impressive views are not enough to build something believable.",The Tourist

I admit it won't win movie of the year but is still equal to or better than many films I see. Depp and Jolie are good, Jolie's English accent is very good, but she speaks too slowly.

77,areatw,The pretty Venice setting is about as far as the positives extend,3,15 July 2018,"It seems the entire budget for 'The Tourist' went on recruiting Depp and Jolie, because almost everything else about this $100 million production seems to have been put together with minimal effort. Even Depp and Jolie themselves are a disappointment, with Depp looking bored out of his mind most of the time and Jolie never really taking to her role. Although given the material they were working with, you can't really blame them.Everything about 'The Tourist' is terrible. The plot is plain silly, the characters one dimensional and shallow, and the dialogue between them forced and unnatural. The only positive to speak of is the beautiful Venice setting and scenery, which offers a welcome distraction from what is a truly awful movie all round.",The Tourist

But the action, actors, environment, details do not looks that convincing, interesting, and real. Feeling of boredom still dominates. Worse than most movies, including ones of Angelina Jolie. It lacks confidence, reality, action, and convincing. Somehow too lame, stubborn, amateur, slow. Lack of speed can be sensed too.",The Tourist
79,classicalsteve,Pure Old-Fashioned Hollywood Fantasy Like the Grant-Hepburn-Kelly films of the1950's and 1960's,7,8 March 2014,"""The Tourist"" is very similar to some of the Hollywood escapist fair of the 1950's and early 1960's with the likes of Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly. In several films during this era, Grant played an American in European exotic locales dealing with espionage in relatively light-hearted plots. The classic films of this ilk which come to mind are ""To Catch a Thief"", ""Charade"", even ""Roman Holiday"", taking place in Monte Carlo, Monaco, Paris, and Rome. In ""The Tourist"", Depp plays a Cary Grant-like character and Angelina Jolie has the long dark hair of Audrey Hepburn with the demureness of Grace Kelly. The action begins in Paris then moves to Venice.The best thing about the film is the opening. The viewer is plopped right into the middle of things without any background or knowledge. A demure mystery woman (Jolie) arrives at a café in Paris near the Champs-Elysees and orders her usual, which we learn is already being prepared. She's a regular. A mysterious note is given to her and provides detailed instructions concerning exact steps she's supposed to take right after leaving the café. While she is reading the note, we learn she is being staked out by government officials. Part of the instruction says ""...pick someone with my height and build and make them believe it is me..."" She burns the note and makes her way to the central train terminal in Paris. Part of the fun of the story is that we don't know who wrote the note, and part of the mystery-fantasy is a gradual revelation regarding who the unknown letter-writer is. (The voice-over for the note is Jolie, which is somewhat confusing at first, because the writer is male.) On a train to Venice, she meets a clueless American tourist from Wisconsin, Frank, played by Johnny Depp. Depp (who doesn't exactly seem like a clueless tourist from Wisconsin) acts flattered that a woman who just walked out of Vogue Magazine would sit by him on the train. And so begins a rather fun, if somewhat improbable, misadventure. Depp appears to be someone ""with my height and build"". Two factions are on the trail on the unknown ""letter-writer"": Scotland Yard authorities who believe he has not paid back taxes on a transaction worth several billion British pounds, and an international mob run by an older baddie who would kill not only a man who cheats on his wife, but he'll kill his wife too, and all the members of both families. He would even kill the man's doctor, just for good measure. The mob boss lost billions to the mystery man who was once a trusted part of his organization. Part of the plot is the tried-and-true ""mistaken identity"" device in which the authorities and the mob appear to be confusing the clueless tourist with the unseen letter-writer. Everyone is sure the man they want is Depp.A fun fantasy which combines elements of romantic-comedy and international espionage. There are a couple of obligatory chase scenes and even a romantic interlude or two, with the compulsory ballroom and casino scenes. What makes it work are the fine performances by Depp and Jolie. The ending is pretty interesting, but there are aspects during the film which don't quite mesh with the information presented previously. But if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and let your imagination run wild, ""The Tourist"" is a fun treat, sort of like a nice bowl of vanilla ice cream. French vanilla of course on Viennese China.",The Tourist
80,vitaleralphlouis,Take this film for what it is.,7,19 April 2011,"More of a romantic comedy than a serious movie, the pace might not please the 9-year old's who dominate the box office in 2011, but adults will enjoy this one. Although not bloodless, there's 90% ;ess gunfire than in most recent movies.Angelina Jolie is usually more attractive, more down-to-earth, not so model-perfect and therefore sexually dis-interesting; but I'm a nice guy and I can cut some slack for the most beautiful woman in the movies. Her team-up with Johnny Depp is not fired-up but it's easy to watch.Also easy to watch are the stunning location shots in Europe; particularly Venice. They check into the stunning Danieli Hotel into a deluxe suite with Grand Canal view. I suppose as international agents they can afford 4,100 Euro a night ($6,000) without comment; but I would have asked the front desk for the suite in the old section. Same price, much more class. The Danieli has three wings (Danieli, Royal and Excelsior). In the Danieli wing your suite is in an actual 16th Century royal palace, with ancient creaky wooden floors (no longer flat) and true antique furniture (except for the flat screen TV's).Not to give the story away but Depp does not eat the breakfast Jolie ordered for him. Too bad. It would have cost $45 to $60. Such things you notice in this kind of movie.",The Tourist
81,dglink,Ravishing Jolie in Clever Intelligent Entertainment,9,30 December 2014,"In a glamorous role that would have suited Grace Kelly in another era, Angelina Jolie is ravishingly elegant in a series of stunning costumes and coiffures as a woman of mystery in ""The Tourist."" Although Johnny Depp is the tourist of the title, Jolie dominates the film, and every eye is upon her whenever she is on-screen. From the outset, Jolie is under surveillance, but by whom and why is only slowly unraveled over the course of the film. She distracts her pursuers with a chance encounter with Depp aboard a French train and, thus, entangles him in her mysterious predicament. Depp is a disheveled math teacher from the States and visibly dazzled by Jolie and her seemingly unlimited funds. Depp accompanies Jolie to Venice, where they stay in a palatial hotel that once hosted Marcel Proust. Always an eye-popping sight, Venice is a city as ravishing as Jolie and becomes the third star of the film under the capable eye of cinematographer John Seale. Like the plot of a Hitchcock film, everyone is pursuing a McGuffin, whose importance is almost irrelevant to the fun involved in chasing it.""The Tourist"" is slick, clever, and entertaining; the film is intelligent and leads to surprises that are truly surprises. However, the well plotted and literate script is no surprise given the award-winning credentials of its three collaborators. Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for Robert Altman's ""Gosford Park"" and Emmys and Golden Globes for ""Downton Abbey,"" brought a touch of class and wit to the writing. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, best known for the Oscar-winning ""The Lives of Others,"" both helmed and co-scripted with Fellowes and with Christopher McQuarrie, who won an Oscar for ""The Usual Suspects."" Although Paul Bettany, Steven Berkoff, and Timothy Dalton are able support, this is a Jolie star vehicle, and even the often scene-stealing Depp lets her shine. Colin Jamison is credited with Ms. Jolie's hair styles and deserves special mention, as does Colleen Atwood for the costume design. When Jolie walks, or perhaps glides, down the street every eye turns her way, and no viewer doubts that her captivating sashay and appearance merit the attention. Not since Grace Kelly in ""To Catch a Thief"" has an actress so embodied glamour, grace, and elegance on screen. Herein, Jolie evokes the golden age of Hollywood, when screen goddesses like Garbo, Crawford, and Dietrich literally glowed on the silver screen ""The Tourist"" is that rare treat, sophisticated, light adult entertainment with romance and intelligence, but without glorified violence, explicit sex, or gratuitous nudity. A terrific script, well paced direction, travelogue locations, good cast, and a stellar Angelina Jolie make for an unqualified recommendation.",The Tourist
82,jon.h.ochiai,"""The Tourist"" is beautiful to look at...",7,23 December 2010,"Standing in French couture upon a motor boat in Venice, Italy the stunning Angelina Jolie says, ""Jack, come with me!"" Now what man would pass that offer? Not Johnny Depp's bewildered and bewitched Frank Tupelo. Jolie is the mysterious femme fatale, and Depp is the apparent random mark in Director/ Writer Florian Henckel von Donnersmack's remake of ""The Tourist"". The upside: The screen's most gorgeous actors, Jolie and Depp, star in this cloak and dagger adventure in spectacular Venice. The downside: ""The Tourist"" is deathly slow in passages following a rather ordinary story of mistaken identity, intrigue, and espionage. The narrative twist works in ""The Tourist"", because of the quirky chemistry of Jolie and Depp. A couple friends hinted this to me, so I was able to discern about half way through. Jolie is gorgeous and effortless—playing to her strengths. Depp is brilliantly nuanced in a way that keeps one guessing.More uncertainty and surprise could have evolved ""The Tourist"" into something great. Screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes's revision of original work by Jerome Salle is less than inspired. However, their narrative is functional in patches leveraging Depp and Jolie charisma. ""The Tourist"" received nominations from the Golden Globes, which is puzzling. At best this is entertaining, but not distinguished work. Admittedly the cinematography of Venice is magnificent, capturing the radiance of light and energy of the city. The wardrobe like its stars is gorgeous. In one scene Jolie wears a stunning red gown to a royal ball that is breathtaking. Unfortunately, the seductive eye candy of ""The Tourist"" does not completely salvage its breezy languid exposition. The end almost justifies the frozen pacing.Elise (Jolie), a rogue operative, in Paris guards the whereabouts of Alexander Pearce, the man who stole $2 billion from mobster Reginald Shaw (charismatic evil Steven Berkoff). Scotland Yard and intrepid Inspector John Acheson (intense Paul Bettany) are tracking Elise in attempt to recover $740 million in owed taxes. None too pleased Chief Inspector Jones (amazing Timothy Dalton) expects expedient results. Apparently, Pearce has altered his appearance to avoid capture. Elise is the key. In a letter, Pearce arranges for rendezvous. He instructs Elise to take the train to Venice, find someone who has his build; because he knows he is under surveillance. That would be unsuspecting widower Wisconsin high school math teacher Frank (Depp). Here Depp's reactions and goofs make interesting the normal film noir homage. The web of intrigue begins.The highlight of ""The Tourist"" is really Venice itself. The cinematography is so rich. Venice is spectacular under gorgeous sun or at night along the canals. ""The Tourist"" is pretty to look at, and that is about it. Jolie and Depp fuel enough chemistry to sustain our attention. I would not rush out to ""The Tourist""; although, I might book a flight to Venice.",The Tourist
83,gkeith_1,Depp a slob; Jolie beautiful.,10,14 October 2016,"I don't like Depp as a slob, but here it was important. He was supposed to be an unkempt math teacher, presumably high school. I didn't like his light eyebrows or terribly unkempt hair in the early scenes. Later, I realized that this was his calculated appearance in order to appear rather incognito.In Finding Neverland, Johnny doesn't ""get the girl"", but here he does, in the end. Johnny has been in a lot of quirky nonromantic parts, including Edward Scissorhands and Willy Wonka. Here, it is more of an adult role which even includes fantasizing about a beautiful woman.Angelina is beautiful and ravishing. She wears beautiful clothes. Her black outfit reminded me of when she was in Maleficent. She has excellent hairstyles. I especially liked her updo at the ball. Despite what detractors have said, I liked it. It was very elegant and sophisticated.It was hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. I had to watch it twice, in order to figure some things out. Look, there's a James Bond, Timothy Dalton, playing a secondary/tertiary part. This is rather shameful, but I realize that ensemble acting does hold a film together. He was the one, near the end, who authorized the shooting of the chief bad guy and all of his goofy minions.10/10 Great.P.S. Depp was reading a spy novel in his opening scene. This must have been a harbinger of the coming storyline, since all I saw later were a bunch of crooks, criminals and villains each trying to grease up their mustaches toward a nifty conclusion after we were kept in suspense a long time.",The Tourist
84,ajs-10,"Suffers a little from 'Style over Substance', but still worth a look",7,14 November 2011,"Although this was never going to be a film that would win any great praise from the great and the good (professional film critics to you and me), I found it still had some good points. I remember it getting a pretty Luke-warm reception when it came out and so I was never tempted to part with my cash at the box-office. So it was a TV viewing for me, which was adequate enough for a film that suffers slightly from 'style over substance'. More of my thoughts after this brief summary.Interpol are watching the beautiful Elise Clifton-Ward in Paris. She is being watched because of her association with one Alexander Pearce who is wanted in several countries. Elise receives a note from Alexander telling her to board a train to Venice and find a man of his height and build so the police would follow him when they got off. She chooses an American tourist, a mathematics teacher called Frank Tupelo. They get talking and have dinner together and when it comes time to leave the police already have his picture Also hot on Alexander's tail is a gangster he stole money from, Reginald Shaw, and he's not one to be trifled with I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be distributing my picture across Europe.It's all beautifully shot, but with locations in both Paris and Venice you can hardly fail to get some great shots though. The performances were all pretty good without anyone particularly standing out; Johnny Depp was pretty good as Frank Tupelo, as was Angelina Jolie as Elsie Clifton-Ward. Paul Bettany as Inspector John Acheson and Timothy Dalton as Chief Inspector Jones also did a decent job. Finally, Steven Berkoff was suitably intimidating as Reginald Shaw.There was a bit more humour than I was expecting with the best one-liner being given to Timothy Dalton at the end (sorry I can't put it in the review it might give too much away). Of course there also has to be a little slapstick from Johnny Depp; a chase sequence that wouldn't have been out of place had he been wearing a pirate uniform springs to mind. I guess where the film falls down though is a rather weak plot that doesn't really tax the little grey cells too much. I must admit I expected more from a stylish thriller of this type. As far as the music goes, well there's not really much to talk about until the closing credits where they use a song by, the rather excellent, Muse. Over all though, a little too much style over substance OK for a TV viewing but I wouldn't spend any cash on the DVD or Blu-Ray.My score: 6.6/10 IMDb Score: 5.9/10 (based on 57,046 votes at the time of going to press).",The Tourist

It's a weird cocktail right from the start and the film feels totally out of place - there's no rhythm to it, no bounce, no feisty chemistry, it's all just mostly off-putting and badly made. Johnny Depp (looking like a wet hang-dog) and Angelina Jolie (who's obviously according to this film the planet's most beautiful creature) feels like a weird pairing anyhow, and together they are stiff and behaves clumsily around Venice while somebody are out to get them. The plot feels thin, and the twist is so obvious that mostly everyone sees it coming half way through, and this makes the viewer drag his way through something that somehow pops along effortlessly and carelessly.

Both Depp and Jolie give decent performances—it's not their best work, but both of them have good chemistry on screen. The other actors do good jobs as well, particularly Paul Pettany and Steve Berkoff. The story doesn't bring anything new to the table—it's another mysterious, spy film type, but with fewer action sequences and more humor. However, there are a couple of good twists that I didn't see coming which suits the mysterious plot perfectly. The cinematography, set design, and score are all well done.

Well I did not; I know what are and how to spell 'knockers'. Knock-off in this case, is what a $15 Rolex or $20 Tag Heuer are, fakes. Yes this movie is not original in the least. It is a remake of the perfectly good 2005 French movie titled Anthony Zimmer.You will love ""The Tourist"" if you like going to McDonald's in France, if you think wine bottles with no labels in Italy are to be avoided and if you think a movie can't be that good if it ain't got Americans starring in it. I take back that last cynical snippet as an exception because I am one of a few who just loved ""The Good Thief"", but I digress. Anthony Zimmer was a straight-up action drama, no funny stuff, no building up the suspense with a profusion of special effects, just the right amount of required special effects; too much special effects is bound to result in reality stretching that distracts from the story.Don't get me wrong I like Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp but Sophie Marceau and Yvan Attal are no lesser actors. You should rent and watch ""Anthony Zimmer"" and see for yourself why the 2005 French movie is rated higher than the 2011 knock-off. I enjoyed both for the story, the performances and the sites, but watching The Tourist could not possibly make me feel the magic of the original. Like the first kiss from the love of your life, that kiss cannot be replicated even by her (or him depending who is reading my review), it's just the way it is.

I'm afraid I may ruin something. But i'll give you what you think the plot is. Depp plays Frank, an math teacher who is traveling to Venice to mend his broken heart. While there, he meets Elise(Angelina Jolie), and she doops him.But thats not the actual plot.I didn't like this as much as Knight and day. I will admit that its smarter.

Rooftops, ledges and other sources of acrophobia abound, as do mistaken identities, a mysteriously ephemeral woman, and various nameless menaces. Notably missing, however, are Hitchcock's intimate touch with characters and the frequently light romantic moments which punctuate the action. As a result, neither Depp nor Jolie are particularly engaging, and the proceedings are on the whole conspicuously lacking in romantic charm, a curious thing in a romantic thriller. Depp and Jolie are watchable enough individually, but never create a real on-screen spark. The production looks good and I liked how plausible the action sequences looked; after years of watching the action genre escalate into the realm of the wildly improbable, this was a welcome choice.

The police have been following Elise for over two years waiting for her to contact her lover, who embezzled over $2 Billion from a mobster. The British Economic Police want to collect its share (taxes) of over $775 Million to be paid on this money. Frank, a math teacher, and Elise must evade the police, and also the mobster who's money was stolen.(My Comment) This movie is unlike many that Angelina Jolie has played in, in that she is involved in very little action. Johnny Depp has a few minor action scenes. Most of the time Angelina walks around looking beautiful, and Johnny is like a lost puppy, almost as if they phoned in their parts. It isn't a totally bad movie; because it only has a little action and a poorly written dialogue for these talented actors. The storyline is not complicated; the mobster's money man steals a large amount of his money, and he is now on the run for his life, plus the police want him too. The movie contains some beautiful panorama scenery of Venice. Overall, the movie is not what you would expect, but it kept my attention, and it is a little entertaining.

94,davidgee,Venice has been rebuilt!,6,16 December 2010,"Wow, Venice has changed since I was last there. They've moved the train station to where the church of Santa Maria della Salute used to be so that Angelina Jolie can have a view of St Mark's Square when she gets off the train. AND they've moved the airport some 20 km closer to the city, so that when she drops Johnny Depp off there's still a lovely view of the Grand Canal in the background. I've never stayed at the Danieli Hotel (seriously pricey) but I'm pretty sure that too has been moved so that Johnny can run along some handy rooftops.Venice is well known to enough people (even in the US midwest) for these liberties with the geography of 'la Serenissima' to leap off the screen. They would be forgivable if this was a better movie. It's from the school of CHARADE, with the male star in peril for a change. Mrs Pitt looks even better than Audrey Hepburn (there's more of her - but not too much) in a series of Givenchy-ish frocks, but Johnny Depp is almost as grungily dressed as he was in SWEENEY TODD. We're meant to believe that his character, Frank, is an ordinary Joe (sorry, Frank) caught up in a series of dangerous situations because Elise (Mrs P) has mistaken him for her crook-on-the-run boyfriend. But Johnny Depp can't seem to do ordinary; Frank doesn't seem bewildered so much as bored. Cary Grant he isn't. And the director's no Stanley Donen.The 'surprise' ending can be seen coming from a mile off (say, about where the airport now is in relation to San Marco!), so despite a few chases around the canals of the world's most beautiful city, there's a fatal lack of suspense. Timothy Dalton and Paul Bettany are wasted in thankless supporting roles. Even Steven Berkoff has a skimpily written part as the chief villain. All in all, a big disappointment.",The Tourist
95,ridi-arahan,What's more charming than a charmer putting his life at risk to convey his regards,7,31 August 2020,"What worked:
The movie is set in Europe , mainly Venice so as a viewer, we get some glimpse of the beautiful city, ambiance and the tone. It's a jolly movie with some good original set, Venice, light humor and enjoyable journey. Also, Angelina and Jonny came together , it's a treat.
What did not work:
screenplay; the movie has a very simple screenplay which worked against themself considering the cast, budget and the possibilities that the crew could have brought to the table. The twists are unconvincing, lame and often unexpected in a bad way. Many scenes are not well written, leads are confused at times, and the narrative has plotholes making it not so much a complete movie. One of the reasons for the movie to have harsh criticism is because the movie with its scale could have been way better if only screenplay and the scenes were well written and choreographed. Even the lead characters especially Angelina seemed to be trying too much to put on the aura of sophistication and glamour which I think did not work on her favor. One of the conclusion of a suspense thriller is the revelation part, this movie fails to convince the viewers with its reveal, if they're any. At times, it's predictable, and at other times it's confusing, unreal and below average. With all being said, the movie is not as worse as it has been said about but it definitely could have been better with some plot amendments.Final verdict: watch Europe and enjoy the view",The Tourist

The action is sparse and the thriller projects it's so that you can guess the ending without even thinking about it. Angelina looks great as usual and most of the film is just scene after scene of her in beautiful clothes.

Call me silly, call me naive or say any other negative comment that occurs to you but the film was, for me at least, hugely entertaining and a marvelous way to spend a late afternoon on a warm Perth evening.Digging my hole deeper, I would go so far as to say that the script was a pleasant combination of thriller and geographic eye candy (both have received dubious criticism); the thriller aspect was not as tightly drawn as with other cinematic classics but I truly did feel that Venice enveloped the viewer with gorgeous visions of the planet's most beautiful city. I found the script contained some interesting turns and some interesting characters and Jolie and Depp played believable roles against the background of this incredible city. I thought that the director had used the city as almost a third character when setting his shots and as I have already said, the city looked beautiful. Depp and Jolie have been criticised for wooden performances but we were watching a movie not a documentary. The visions before us need not be as true to life as that documentary; it can just be enjoyable and be judged by that standard and by that standard I thought it was an excellent film.",The Tourist
101,AvidClimber,Boring and unimaginative at best,5,15 June 2013,"The Tourist is a flop despite using good actors.The good. Nice views of Venice.The actors. They all have done better work than this. Angelina Jolie is playing her role too cold. Johnny Depp is boring with only hints of interesting.The bad. In the train, she's sitting on the edge of her seat all the time. Poor story. Shallow characters.The ugly. How can you tail a small boat with a bigger boat barely a 50m back? Not to mention tailing that boat with an other bigger boat and in an empty canal... Disastrous.The result. Not worth seeing unless you have really nothing else to do and are a huge fan of Depp or Jolie.",The Tourist
102,BrnzReviews,Incredibly Made & A Great Ending!,8,19 July 2021,"This movie was such a great one, being a big fan of Johnny Depp i knew I'd like it. I really felt entertained the entire duration, and the beautiful Angelina Jolie is also in this which is an even bigger bonus, the story is very interesting, the type that keeps you engaged enough that you really feel you have to keep watching to find out what's going to happen to the character we've enjoyed to see.The reason I'm so fond of Johnny Depp is that he is such a versatile actor who can branch out and become completely different in the role, when a man or woman can do that, its just pure talent, an incredible watch that you should definitely check out.Highly recommend such a grsat experience it was watching this, ignore the haters this is great!",The Tourist
103,AishFan,Unrealistic and clichéd,5,13 December 2010,"The Tourist boasts of big stars, foreign locales, and a gripping script, but the film just ends up disappointing. Angelina Jolie has overdone her plastic surgery and doesn't look that attractive in this film. The mafia don, surrounded by his Russian henchmen, is so clichéd, it's not even funny. There were too many trite, over-the-top sequences in this movie, such as the protagonist rushing in against all odds to save his lady. The movie simply seemed too unrealistic and predictable to be an effective thriller. Venice, a breathtakingly beautiful city that has been captured magnificently in other films, is not exploited well-enough. A few unappealing shots taken there are repeatedly shown to the audience. There is a twist at the end, however, that makes up for some of the film's weaknesses. Angelina gives a good performance; Johnny Depp is not bad.",The Tourist
104,jamiedarlow-37510,"A very entertaining, fun and romantic film",6,12 February 2020,"Depp and Jolie are a great pairing and the romance between them was the part I liked most. However, the ending very nearly ruined it. Without giving too much away, it also makes Depp's character slightly less memorable than he was during the rest. Nevertheless, it had me smiling all the way through (particularly the first half hour) and although it's a bit forgettable, it's still worth seeing for a bit of fun!",The Tourist
105,dvc5159,"A light, swift, yet somewhat uneven comedy/thriller but far from being the atrocity that critics claimed it to be",5,5 January 2011,"I absolutely hate it when movies get bad marketing. ""The American"" last year is a perfect example of horrible marketing to a fantastic movie, leading to wrong audience expectations and thus a poor public reception (to their credit the film did open at no. 1 that weekend, unfortunately proving that such a deceitful gimmick works).""The Tourist"" from that same year suffers from the same marketing problem. Meaning, it is a comedy/thriller caper which was marketed as an espionage action flick judging from the trailers alone. Yeesh, when will proper marketing come? So it's little wonder why critics bashed this film a lot seeing that it's actually a light, breezy comic thriller with two Hollywood megastars phoning in their roles amidst some beautiful scenery, lavish production design and a nice variety of European supporting actors to boot.The film, a remake of Jerome Salle's French thriller ""Anthony Zimmer"" with added comic zest, is a fun way to waste an hour and a half, presumably with a date. For those expecting a thrilling action adventure, look somewhere else. The film moves along at a fine breezy pace, the Venitian scenery looking gorgeous as ever as per Angelina showing of her beautiful looks, Johnny Depp being his Jack Sparrow character again albeit grounded in reality and less talkative and more careful, and the music by James Newton Howard all segues in quite nicely.However, the screenplay is quite uneven. At times sharp and at others clichéd, the script sometimes forgets whether it is more of a comedy than a thriller and vice versa - and there are some confusing moments too. Another complaint is that Angelina and Johnny Depp look like they're just acting instead of being the characters - at times it seems like they have no interest in the roles, and their chemistry is quite off. However, I did like the very interesting choice of supporting actors - and we got a very talented bunch here - Paul Bettany as the incompetent and vain Interpol agent with James Bond 007 himself Timothy Dalton as his boss. Bond villain Steven Berkoff plays a sly villain well (with Indiana Jones henchman Igor Jijikine among his Russian goons) and there's Rufus Sewell as a mysterious ghost-like person as well. Among all of the actors, it is Dalton who steals the scene here, despite his very brief screen time in the film.Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who helmed the superb German film ""The Lives of Others"", takes a step backward with this film, but manages to give a very classy and elegant European feel to the film. He also shoots the humorous moments in a very subtle way as opposed to the crude slapstick or dark humor preferred by many movie audiences today, making it easy on the brain, eyes and ears to boot. His direction gives the film an old-school European feel. If only von Donnersmarck can give the same focus on the main actors as well.So overall it's a nice time waster with some off moments, but definitely not the disaster critics are making it out to be. See it, laugh, forget about it afterwords. Keep in mind that this is a COMEDY and NOT an ACTION film.Overall rating: 55/100",The Tourist

108,bluesman-20,Johnny Depp and Anglina Jolie in a thriller that thrills.,10,29 December 2010,The Tourist isn't for everyone's tastes. But given that the movie has the cast it has plus Two of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the moment you can't help but like the movie. The Story is a little clichéd but it has been done since North by Northwest and it doesn't disappoint. Angelina Jolie plays Elise Ward a mysterious woman who is being watched by the police agencies of Europe. The reason is clear soon enough. She is the girlfriend of a mysterious thief named Alexander Pierce whom it seems just hi jacked over 7oo billion dollars of a gangsters money but it seems since he is a British subject he is being chased for taxes owed. Now Pierce has disappeared and the cops and the gangsters are on the lookout for him and their only lead is Elise. Pierce gives her messages with directions on what to do next and one message instructs her to get on a train and find a stranger with his build and his height. she meets Frank Tupleo a math teacher struggling with a broken heart and travelling all over Europe to find ways to cope. Elise and him meet and they become friends of a sort. But the deed is done the trap is sprung and Frank is targeted by everyone who assumes he's Pierce. The movie has a good build up solid acting and a rarity for a movie these days a actual Plot a movie that is actually depended on it's story and the characters and the build up and not special effects. This movie is not for everyone. Just to make it clear but I liked it and my wife liked it and we passed a nice afternoon watching it and when we left the theatre we sere still talking about the movie and how much we liked it and what we liked. Angelina Jolie is a class act and Johnny Depp Steals the movie not a easy thing to do with the cast involved . But you can see they had fun filming it and it shows.,The Tourist
109,yris2002,rather boring and unimpressive,6,30 December 2010,"If you want to see Angelina Jolie's or Johnny Depp's face shot a thousand times, and always in the same expression, you will probably get satisfied by this movie, which may indeed be considered as a slide show of pictures of the two actors, moving slowly with a boring soundtrack, and nothing more. The story sounds only at the beginning a little intriguing, but not so much to commit the Christmas public too much, the ""action"" shots are something dèjà vu and not so involving, the script really boring, and the overall effect unimpressive. The story seems to be stretched, with long and boring scenes, as to come at least to a 90 minutes timerun, and the attempt at some ""fun"" does not get to enliven the overall dullness of the whole picture. The only merit, the picture does not give in to the easy temptation to make the two characters fall in bed, and to portray their relationship without any vulgar hints. The only kind of consolation: also the charming Angelina and the handsome Johnny get older and suffer the mercilessness of time!",The Tourist

111,rollernerd,Amazing scenic views but terrible story,6,24 August 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**
Today's movie review is the mystery thriller - The Tourist (2010) starring two A-list starts including Angelina Jolie and the ever versatile Johnny Depp. The movie has the feels of a Hitchcock thriller where Depp can be seen playing a Cary Grant role and Jolie as Grace Kelly or even Audrey Hepburn. The locations are set in beautiful Venice and Paris where Jolie plays an elegant proud woman of mystery who is under surveillance and soon receives word from her top international criminal lover, instructing her to travel to Venice and make friends with any guy with his approximate height and build which can be a smoke mirror where this charade will convince the cops that it's him in heavy disguise. So Jolie gets on the next train up a bedazzled tourist - a long-haired, goateed maths teacher played by Johnny Depp. She intends to get rid of him once he's served his purpose. But they find a special park with each other and pair up to be in a dangerous espionage escapade.What can I say about this film?? The above premise sounds great and appealing but the plot and acting was off. The facial expressions of both actors seems robotic and they never change or show real emotion. For example when both are being shot at or chased across loose-tiled rooftops by gangsters or through the rivers of Venice you expect some kind of emotion..but nope. Jolie seems stiff and only has this mysterious smile as if doing a commercial ad for a perfume fragnance where the Maybelline logo may appear in the bottom. And Depp...he plays his familiar awkward quirky persona who appears to be over-his-head. His role feels familiar and offbeat. The only scene he does really well and the only scene where I felt entertained and engaged was the chase sequence where we see Depp running across roofs and jumping down balconies in a pyjama suit while being chased by a gang of gun trigger assassins.A plus side of this film was the picturesque setting including the Venice waterways and the crème of the top interior hotels. Other than that the movie's plot feels muddled and really lost interest which can be a fault to the writers of the movie. Overall the movie feels lost where some instances it feels intense and dark then soon transitions towards a more chilled outing along with the little spark between the two leads where it may seem both are holding back - 5.8/10, disappointed.",The Tourist
112,dy158,Hunting for a man in disguise,6,17 November 2013,"In the beginning, it did not make sense why Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie) is being followed. The French Police along with the Scotland Yard led by Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) are on the trail of Elise on a regular basis, where Elise would receive instructions from her lover Alexander Pearce in a letter at a Parisian café before she burned the letter after reading it.By the time Elise had boarded the train to Venice, the police had managed to piece together the burned letter in terms of what it contained. They would come to board the same train Elise would be on. Elise would come to meet a mathematics teacher from the United States in Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp) on the train and the two along the route to Venice seemingly starting a romance. When they arrived in Venice, Elise invited Frank to stay with her at her room at the Royal Hotel Danieli where she would further receive written instructions from Pearce.Even if Elise is revealed to be an undercover agent with Scotland Yard but being under suspension for suspected sympathies with Pearce but is together with Frank whom she is using as a ruse to distract her employer, they have been led to initially believe that Frank is actually Pearce. It did not stop Acheson from trying to hunt Pearce down in Venice, regardless whether he is actually there or not. But the mobster Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff) whom Pearce had stolen $2.3 billion from is also in Venice as well.On the surface, the film does have the usual elements of a thriller. But instead of the car-chasing, it is through the boats as the hunt for Pearce takes place in Venice. But there is also the elements of the romance as well, before it is what happened towards the climax where there is a twist over the real identity of Frank.The backdrop which formed the basis of the film does make a pleasing spectacle, in terms of taking place from Paris to Venice as the chase for Pearce takes place. It does also have its tense moments apart from the romance elements. It is best not to view it as just simply a thriller, given of what is the overall plot.",The Tourist
113,jb_campo,OK flick but seems to fall flat much of the time,6,20 April 2014,"This was an OK film that failed to really ignite much of anything, hence my 6/10 score. Shots of Jolie walking here, there, with men just dropping their jaw, kind of were, yeah, stupid. Elegent scenes in Venice should have been doable, but again, no real sting to them.Johnny Depp looked fat faced. What was up with that? Was that on purpose? He looked about 20 lbs overweight too, again, on purpose?Most of all, as I read in another post, there was zero chemistry anywhere in the movie. I must say, this therefore was miscast, or misdirected, because it could have been a good story. But the longer it endured, the more you could start to get a hint for what was what, so in the end, there were no real surprises. You were just surprised that 1\ you spent 2 hours watching this, and 2\ anyone would believe that real police behave the way these departments did. Failure to excite, miscast, thin plot. I guess I should have rated it lower, except that Venice by itself rates a 6. Good luck with this if you choose to watch it.",The Tourist
114,nicolechan916,"Not a well crafted story which made it predictable, but acting was good.",6,11 January 2015,"It was pretty interesting at first with the development of the story, but it kind of drifted along for the rest of the film. It wasn't boring to watch, but it was disappointing overall. Also, the ending was way predictable. With the development of movies nowadays, it isn't that easy to fool the audience or wow them any more. This certainly failed to do so.The acting though was pretty great. Well you can't expect anything less from two A-list stars. They managed to get into their roles well, and Depp always just looks like Depp to me, regardless of his character. The chemistry between the two was somewhat superficial though, and felt more like ""because the script says so"". Also, the fact that they objectified Jolie's character and her body is horrendous. All the males turning their heads to follow her just makes me want to slap them, or the director. On top of that, she can take care of herself throughout the whole film, but at the end she just needs to be the damsel in distress. Pourqoi?However, the setting of the movie complemented the film really well. The visuals were pleasing and wonderful. The addition of the Italian culture (boats, language etc) was cool, and makes me want to go there and visit.That's basically all there is to the film. The story went up and down, and got really predictable and cheesy at the end. The acting was great but the chemistry not so much. The setting of the film and its landscape was the best thing in this film.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",The Tourist
115,badajoz-1,How to Make a Plodding Movie!,2,28 May 2013,"Dear, oh dear - a failed attempt at a Hitchcock movie - and does it plod ever so slowly. Plot is simple - a mysterious Englishman owes a lot of money to HMRC in UK, but nobody knows what he now looks like. The money is part of what he stole from a mobster, who kills people without thought. Now how could someone owe the UK government tax on money stolen from a hood!!!!!???? The tax authorities and the gangster (played to the hilt by Steven Berkoff) are tracking the thief's ex-girlfriend ( a well dressed Angelina Jolie) to see when she will meet this mysterious Mr Pierce. To throw them off the scent, Miss Jolie pretends that a passing tourist Math teacher from Wisconsin (Johnny Depp) she meets on a train from Paris to Venice, is the man they are all after. Complications and twists ensue before all is resolved.The script has its' moments but they are few; the direction is ponderous and lifeless (deliberately so, I feel, to distance the film from the likes of 'Fast and Furious!'); the acting perfunctory ( and I'm being kind): the action turgid; and the spark between the stars barely flickers - they should have returned their whacking great salaries! It is a plot made for Cary Grant and Grace Kelly in their prime, where the wisecracking dialogue would carry the soufflé of the plot, but, no, instead of sparkling lines, we have Johnny 'I can't really act' Depp plodding unconvincingly through a charade of a performance that does not convince on any level. A wasted opportunity - the participants should be ashamed of themselves.",The Tourist
116,geminiredblue,"Nice Scenery, Not Much Else",2,3 May 2011,"I went into THE TOURIST thinking ""Okay, will this be another case of mistaken identity, or perhaps another BOURNE movie?"" The synopsis makes it sound like another one of those international thrillers, like Hitchcock used to make. Unfortunately, as the movie started to play, I realized early on that aside from the beautiful scenery, and gorgeous actors, there really isn't much else to it. I only made it about 30 minutes before I lost interest and turned it off. All the right pieces were in place, the movie was just so boring. It's like the filmmakers deliberately tried to draw out the movie. Not a good idea, see my upcoming review of ""The Touch of Satan"" for more info! When filmmakers are deliberately slowing the pace down, you know there's not much material there. Sad to say, I think this is Johnny Depp's least-compelling performance. Angelina Jolie's role seems to be reduced to looking pretty all the time. Take my advice, don't waste your time with a film that deliberately wastes yours!",The Tourist
117,Jerique,Decent...,7,3 April 2011,"I was told by a friend that this movie was not very good due to the fact that Depp and Jolie phoned-in their performances. However, I feel different.Johnny Depp is not quite the over-the-top star in this film like his roles in Pirates of Caribbean. He doesn't dominate the screen, but more so takes a backseat to Angelina Jolie.Jolie plays a woman, Elise who is trying to pawn off a random tourist, Frank (Depp), in order to get a debt scratched from a big-time crime lord.It's an intriguing story but it is very predictable. I had a feeling about the ending early on. However, they both do a good job of playing their characters who are on the run. Depp plays the 'confused innocent' for awhile. The supporting cast is not too bad, either. Plus, the locations, whether real or studio are beautiful.I won't say that it's a great movie but it is at least decent enough to watch a few more times. I wouldn't mind showing it to a friend or something, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a fan of Depp, Jolie or a secret agent movies.",The Tourist
118,ScottDMenzel,"""The Tourist"" leaves its audience feeling a bit of jet lag",6,13 December 2010,"In ""The Tourist,"" Angelina Jolie stars as Elisa, a woman who has been assigned to hide the identity of her lover Alexander Pierce from the FBI and the mob. Elisa is told in a letter by Pierce that she is to board the 8:22 train to Venice and find someone who she can use to pose as him. On the train ride to Venice, Elise eyes a random American tourist named Frank (Johnny Depp), who is traveling alone as a way to forget about the death of his wife. This is where the plot thickens as Elise decides to use Frank as the perfect impostor for Pierce, who has no clue to what he is about to get himself into.The storyline for ""The Tourist"" was actually based on a previous film called ""Anthony Zimmer,"" which I never saw nor heard about before this past week. I originally thought ""The Tourist"" was an original film but it was in fact, a remake. I found that ""The Tourist"" lacked suspense and I found the story to be almost too simplistic and obvious. My fiancée Ashley, also known as my movie partner in crime, didn't find the film as obvious as I did but actually found the film lacking action. I would have to agree with her there as well. There just wasn't enough action for a film of this caliber. Also, some scenes went on too long where they could have been better if they were cut in half. On that same page, I also have to point out that the film itself was very slow moving and could have been cut down to an hour and a half to make the film flow better.I won't deny it for a hot minute that I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp and I have seen every film the man has put out over the past 12 years or so. I think Depp is one of the biggest names in the Hollywood along with one of the most talented actors of this generation. Depp seems to be able to play a large array of roles from ""Donnie Brasco"" to The Mad Hatter in ""Alice in Wonderland."" It seems Depp can conquer all roles no matter how odd or straight laced they are. With that being said, Depp is comical in ""The Tourist"" and he uses his charm on the audience to really make him the most enjoyable thing about the film. The one thing Depp can't do however, is find chemistry with Angelina Jolie. Their relationship in ""The Tourist"" was probably one of the weakest links in the film. For some reason neither Depp or Jolie seemed to connect with one another. Maybe the idea of putting two of the most beautiful people together in one film should rely more on chemistry than $$$. I don't really know why Depp and Jolie lacked chemistry could it be because of the director? The story? Or maybe it was just simply the two actors didn't really feel that deep connection with one another on the set. I don't know why per say but the chemistry just wasn't there.As for Jolie, she plays the typical role that she has played before in multiple films. Many will argue she adds little twists to her characters so they aren't 100% the same and I will agree with that statement. However, Jolie plays the same sexy woman of mystery who everyone is trying to kill in this film . At times, Jolie almost looked bored and uninterested in the film. She also lacked facial expressions, which I found odd. As I mentioned above, her relationship with Depp wasn't believable nor did the two have chemistry. As I said about Depp, I don't know if the characters she played lacked that special something because the script lacked or if it was just the bond Depp and Jolie had with one another. I just couldn't get over the fact that these two A-listers lacked that much on screen.It may seem that I am really attacking ""The Tourist"" but the truth is I liked it but was just expecting a lot more from it. It was one of those films which, when I heard about it, I was extremely excited to see it. What I got was a film that didn't live up to the hype I created for it nor that most people had created for it. It's not a bad movie at all it's just incredibly average, which is the ultimate problem with ""The Tourist."" Everything from the story, the direction, and even the acting, is just average. Nothing really blows you away and that's why so many people are leaving this film disappointed. It's not that its horrible or hell even a bad film, it's just a disappointment, plain and simple.Depp is hands down the best part of the film and without his involvement even though he lacks chemistry with Jolie, the film would probably be really really bad. His charm, subtle comedic gestures, and just the oddness of his character really saved the film from being below average. I would recommend the film but probably more as a matinée or DVD rental instead of a night showing at the local multiplex. It's a shame with the amount of talent involved the film that it couldn't breach out of average territory.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Tourist"" is a 6 out of 10. A decent film for Depp fans but Jolie and die-hard Depp fans will surely be slightly disappointed.",The Tourist
119,TheMovieMark,Director von Donnersmarck needs to be Donnersmacked,4,10 December 2010,"Considering the fact that Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie are two of the biggest stars in the world, you may have at one time flippantly claimed, ""I'd pay $10 just to watch them read the phone book!"" Well, if you decide to ignore my advice then you'll have the chance to put the equivalent of that theory to the test if you lay down your hard-earned dinero to see The Tourist.Displaying the focus of an attention deficit schizophrenic, The Tourist weaves its way through an odd mixture of romantic, comedic, and mysterious elements. I have no problem with a film that embraces multiple genres, as long as it can do so effectively. The problem with this film is I was never sure what type of reaction the film wanted to evoke. The romantic orchestra soars one moment, we're treated to a few slapstick shenanigans the next, and then comes the brooding minor key to remind us that there's a mysteriously mysterious mystery afoot! I would not have been shocked had Rowan Atkinson made an appearance.Plus, the ""climactic"" twist isn't as clever as it thinks. I suppose one might be forgiven if he or she finds it cutesy, but even if you do fall for it, by the time it arrives your interest will be too detached to care.Eliciting little more than a few chuckles and a whole lot of apathy, The Tourist makes its mark as one of this year's most pointless and useless films. I can't single anything out as being truly awful, but neither can I think of a single reason why you should consider spending $10 a pop on a film that offers absolutely nothing new to the cinematic universe. The Italian backdrop is nice to look at, and Jolie and Depp are adequate, if not dynamic in their chemistry, but it takes more than the visual image of Depp traversing rooftops barefooted and in grandpa's pajamas to be deemed worthy of my time.Entertain, engage, educate, or humor me. That's all I ask. The Tourist decided to go with ""none of the above,"" therefore I encourage you to think twice before making this your selection.",The Tourist
120,perkypops,Perhaps it can't keep a secret but The Tourist is fun!,7,12 November 2011,"It would be quite wrong to compare this film to the magical classic ""Charade"", but it does have a light, fluffy touch with a big hint of tease in the action. And there are some gorgeously overacted moments in the film in an attempt to distract us or, perhaps, to make sure we get the point or even the plot. My first guess was accurate enough although I did have to almost change my mind a couple of times, but then I am just fickle. Now in the magical ""Charade"" I guessed right first time but then went through serious doubts..... but I did want Audrey Hepburn to survive, oh yes I did. And I can say the same about Angelina Jolie who just keeps getting better. And what can I say about Johnny Depp that has not been said already? He just does what he does so well.The cast do their jobs so well and even a veteran James Bond manages to make the film very British which is why it works. So forgive it the lapses into comedy if you wanted something more serious, The TOurist is a great way to enjoy two hours in a cinema seat, it really is.Seven out of ten, but worth more if you get my meaning.",The Tourist
121,colinrgeorge,Tourist Trap,6,13 December 2010,"2010 has been a year glutted with mediocre spy fare. ""The Tourist"" joins the dubious ranks of ""Red,"" ""Knight and Day,"" and ""Killers""—and that it might be the best of the lot isn't saying much. Anchored by arguably the strongest cast, including stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, ""The Tourist"" moves at a more relaxed pace than its blockbuster brethren. Then again, ""Red"" was plenty slow, but still wound up nigh incomprehensible.I understood ""The Tourist,"" which is a complement, unfortunately. The Venetian caper keeps its audience in the loop, with a story thankfully straightforward enough to follow. Jolie plays Elise Clifton-Ward, the squeeze of a master criminal who's lifted two billion pounds from a no-nonsense English gangster (Steven Berkoff). In order to keep the identity of her mysterious lover secret, she employs the aid of an unwitting proxy, American tourist and self described ""math teacher,"" Frank Tupelo (Depp).Maybe the most impressive part of Depp's performance is that it feels like the first human character he's portrayed in years. Leapfrogging from roles like Willy Wonka to Sweeney Todd to John Dillinger, surely nobody doubts Depp's ability to consistently transform himself. After watching him ham it up as Jack Sparrow in three consecutive ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies however, I was surprised by how charming the man can be without his usual flamboyancy. He's hardly brilliant in ""The Tourist,"" but by scaling back the theatrics and focusing instead on playing an actual person, he reminded me of something I had since forgotten—I actually really like Johnny Depp.Jolie is less interesting as his seductive captor. The actress has recently whittled herself down to little more than a skeleton with full lips; her sharp inset cheekbones and sickly pipe- cleaner legs make many a male head turn in ""The Tourist."" Thanks but no thanks, the double- digit weight doesn't do much for me. Jolie is playing beautiful, elegant, and sexy, but she just looks malnourished.Her physical appearance doesn't detract from the performance, however, and her chemistry with Depp is what makes ""The Tourist"" sail, though the plot is eventually blown in an unexpected and unwelcome direction, after which the film struggles to stay afloat. The silly twist undoes a lot of the goodwill the film has going for it, and its final minutes feel as though they're unraveling rather than unifying what came before.Directed by German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (""The Lives of Others""), ""The Tourist"" is a decidedly marginal success, but a success nonetheless. It makes a few interesting decisions to distinguish itself from its middling colleagues—unlike ""Knight and Day,"" von Donnersmarck casts Jolie, his female lead, as the savvy spy and Depp as the smitten Joe Average instead of subjecting them to more conventional gender roles.This review may be full of half-compliments, but ""The Tourist"" is played so down the middle that there's next to nothing to say about it to begin with. It was admittedly a pleasant surprise keeping in mind the critical reaming it received via Rotten Tomatoes. In competition with any of the other mediocre to outright terrible espionage films mentioned above, I would recommend ""The Tourist"" without hesitation—taken alone, it receives a significantly less enthusiastic endorsement.There is, however, one 2010 spy flick to which ""The Tourist"" doesn't hold a candle (and coincidentally, another film about traveling abroad): Anton Corbijn's ""The American,"" which arrives on home video December 28th.

If you see any of Jolie's films this year watch Salt instead of this one. A complete bore with a storyline we have seen a 1000 times before. Sorry but nuff said about this one! Cannot believe Hollyweird charge us big bucks to see this garbage! Johnny Depp one of the hottest and coolest movie stars today , I would think would be Little more careful when selecting scripts.

123,Irie212,I never thought I'd say this about Angelina Jolie,5,12 June 2011,"I saw The Tourist because of the director, von Donnersmarck. His only other feature, The Lives of Others, is so subtle, so moving, so pitch-perfect that no number of damning reviews could have steered me off this, his next effort. That puts me in a minority, no doubt. Most people paid to see Depp and Jolie, separately or together. Depp doesn't disappoint (nor does von Donnersmarck), but Angelina Jolie sinks this movie.She's not the only problem, of course. The plot is harder to believe than the Old Testament. It's saved by the setting in Venice, and the moments of wryness in the dialog (almost all Depp's), and the talent including von Donnersmarck, Depp, Paul Bettany, Steven Berkoff, Christian de Sica, and, fleetingly, Rufus Sewell as a bemused plot device. (No, I haven't forgotten about Timothy Dalton, whose acting chops escape me.)Jolie is omitted from that list. Though she's a gifted actress, as she proved once and for all in ""A Mighty Heart,"" she doesn't even attempt to act in The Tourist. Throughout the film-- except, briefly, when she's in a baggy sweater on a boat-- she reminded me of film critic Dwight MacDonald's description of Brigitte Bardot at the height of her freakish popularity in 1960: ""Bardot has become a grotesque, a product of biological overspecialization like a borzoi, her face has been reduced to the sexual essentials... those huge staring eyes, the great thick-lipped toothy mouth, the cascades and whorls and fountains of hair."" Fifty years later, Jolie has out-Bardoted Bardot. She seems to have glued fur or perhaps dead caterpillars to her eyelashes, and her make-up is so thick I wondered if the crew didn't have to check it periodically with a dipstick. More forty-weight foundation here!The freak factor could be forgiven, but where has her talent gone? Depp seems miscast, but he carries his role with his usual light comic touches and his unselfconscious ease, a characterization enhanced by the fact that he seems to have spent less than a minute in a make-up chair, none of it with a comb. He's real. In contrast, Jolie is a Colleen Atwood-clad mannequin with (as MacDonald wrote of BB) ""no lightness, no verve, no womanly softness, no change of pace."" Her performance is a series of posed stills. It is disheartening to see an actress sell out both her natural beauty and her notable talent for a career that seems to be based wholly on glamor and celebrity. I find myself wondering if Ms. Jolie, with her ample tattoos and numerous adoptions and heavily publicized liaisons, isn't the Hollywood equivalent of an opera diva. I think they're called narcissists.",The Tourist

It was decent enough as a film to get away, but beyond that, a DVD rental at best.You would think with Depp and Jolie in the leads, there would be chemistry aplenty. However, there is very little spark between the two leads. They have been excellent with other actors/actresses in the past, but together, it is almost like they are holding back. There are reports Depp's life partner was none too pleased with who his lead actress was and made sure to be a presence. Whether that is true or not, it would be a possible explanation for the restraint. Whatever it was, the lack of chemistry keeps the film from being all it could be.The story is pretty straight forward, or so you think. It does take some detours here and there. I don't want to give too much away for that do what to take in the film. There is some real intrigue created the first couple of acts. You are giving tidbits here and there to keep you guessing just what really is going on. Jolie ends up being more than what you are led to believe from the first two acts. In what has to be one of his most ""normal"" roles ever, Depp plays the role of fish out of water excellently. It is a fun film to watch, but the lack of chemistry really affects everything else with this film.

Now that I've seen him in just about every guise, I can confidently assert that the man would look suave in a bin liner. Ditto Angelina Jolie. In a previous age, men would have gone to war over her. 'Creative differences', i.e. rows that previous actors and directors attached to this film had allowed these two beauties to unite for the first time. Scotland Yard pursues Jolie, as she will lead them to Alexander Pearce, who is on the run for stealing billions from a British gangster. Jolie receives periodical missives from Pearce, which detail his moves. She is instructed to stay with a man resembling Pearce until they reunite. She (obviously) chooses Depp, a bland but suitable maths teacher from Wisconsin, who happens to be holidaying in Venice. I would not dare give away the ending, but what made me guess the final twist 45 minutes in was my observation that the film's boringness would have multiplied exponentially had it not been what I suspected. It's doubly annoying when first-rate actors give second-rate performances but Oxford graduate, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck can be blamed for directing this film (with such a stupid story, what room could there have been for 'creative differences'?).

Mysterious plots, an exotic city of Venice and promising Director as well, everything looks just fine, what could go wrong? But unfortunately, what you are about to experience is no other than ""Being a Tourist and Eventually Got Misguided"". The movie is based on Luc Besson and Sophie Marceau movie entitled ""Anthony Zimmer"" in 2004. An American tourist Frank is approached by a mysterious girl Elise (who can deny the beautiful girl like Angelina Jolie anyway, can't you?) in a train on a journey to Venice, Italy. In the beginning, Elise has a hidden intention to use Frank as a decoy from the hunt of police and Russian mafia. Now everyone thinks Franks is her long-lost fugitive lover and intelligent thief, Alexander Pearce. Actually, the basic material is very promising with some twists and turns in development. But in the process, they could not get a precise romantic atmosphere. The interaction between the two main characters is stiff and awkward. Frankly says, there is no chemistry here. Even though, Johnny Depp has always been my No. 1 favorite Actor (I have all of his movies, all!) but unfortunately in thiz movie he looks too childish to be next to Jolie. You can see there is still a little bit of ""Capt. Jack Sparrow"" in Depp's character. He looks charming, but most of the times he becomes so uncomfortably clumsy and lazy. On the other side, for me Jolie more looks like ""A Supermodel Walking throughout Her Catwalk"". Yes, with the smile like that and her sharp eye gaze, beautiful elegant dresses, who can resist the whole eye candy package. But I have to say, it could be the most boring appearance of Angelina Jolie of all-time. What she does here just keep smiling all the time, without doing exploration for her character. Jolie is doing what I called ""Robotic Performance"". Too much smile, too much pride, and too much eyelashes. A better performance comes from Paul Bettany as inspector John. The other Supporting Cast members are Timothy Dalton, Rufus Sewell and the memorable one Reginald Shaw who is very convincing as a Russian mobster boss named Berkoff. The Director of thiz movie is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. I find myself enjoying his latest creation a lot more which is one of respectable German movies in 2006, ""The Lives of Others"". It's supposed to be ""Ravishing"", but instead it happens to be ""ravenous"". In the end, if you came to the theater to see some good looking faces. Well You were part of the plan!

132,jburtroald95,So much fun!,8,27 December 2010,"A vivacious, adventurous, crowd-pleasing comedy-action flick such as this is always welcome amongst the heavier adult fodder in today's world of cinema – the snappy, witty dialogue; the stylishly captured espionage; the wildly-conceived plots: we just lap it up ravenously. They are especially easy to love when they happen to feature a host of Hollywood favourites in highly entertaining roles.Here we have, firstly, a gorgeously immersive Angelina Jolie taking on the role of a captivatingly charismatic femme fatale named Elise. Once a top government agent, she has turned criminal in order to save her rebellious bank-robber boyfriend Alexander Pearce from police capture. As part of a tactic to throw the fiercely determined Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany) off the scent, she travels to Venice and picks up an Alexander lookalike on the way to accompany her.The man she chooses, Frank Tupelo (played wonderfully by the unbelievably talented Johnny Depp) is an effectively complementary character with a shy, imbecilic air about him. Their early interactions are propelled and dominated almost completely by the strong-willed Elise, with Frank struggling to keep up and childishly accepting all of her forceful cavalier statements and actions.Although when the plan is complete and it's time to for her to ditch him, they have of course fallen in love and his new firmness fuelled by his deep longing for her certainly complicates things. No matter how many times he is pushed away, he will persistently return to her side, soon finds suddenly severing their bond much harder than she had anticipated, however deceitfully it might have been forged. It is a timeless and always promising sort of scenario, the likes of which have appeared in all manner of previous romance movies from 'Moulin Rouge' (2001) to 'Titanic' (1997).Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and co-starring Steven Berkoff and Timothy Dalton; splendidly decadent, impeccably engrossing and unexpectedly hilarious, The Tourist is, in the end, really only let down by two nigglingly unsound plot points. Firstly, a sappy, sluggish lull surfaces in the middle and threatens to be the usual pathetic attempt at pathos, but thankfully is much more short-lived than we feared. Secondly, the conclusion comes with a disappointingly far-fetched and anti-climactic sting in the tail that almost completely shuts down all that had been so brilliantly set up before; but not in an awe-inspiring, intelligent way – it is so lacking in believability that one doesn't quite understand what the writers are getting at. However, these two flaws hardly detract from the overall enjoyment.",The Tourist
133,thomvic,I'd rather just go to Venice myself and be my own tourist.....,2,24 December 2010,"For one thing, if this is meant to be a comedy, I didn't find this very humorous at all. If it is meant to be a thriller, well there weren't many to begin with. So what is it trying to be? While I am a fan of Angelina, and she looks absolutely gorgeous in this, she is pretty much flat out boring. There was practically no chemistry with her or Johnny Depp, who I found Depp extremely dull as a character.So what is the plot? Well Angelins plays a British woman named Elise, who is out to set up a lucky or maybe not so lucky unsuspecting male in order to lead the cops astray. She is in love with a man called Alexander Pearce, and then deliberately chooses Frank (Depp) in order to make the police think he is Alexander, who has stolen more than 700 million in tax evasion money.The plot is a bit stupid and I did not feel any warmth with the performances of Angelina or Johnny. I honestly felt the twist thing at the end was laughable, because it feels so unimaginative or plausible for that matter.The main problem I think is that I was not convinced with how Depp's character ends up falling for Elise. Depp gives a really wooden performance, and he almost looks uncomfortable, as though he really is overwhelmed by Angelina's beauty and he feels somewhat subconscious being alongside her. For such a terrific actor, I really wonder what made him pick a role such as this when there is way better material around.Oh and the ending - hahahaha. That was one of the most ridiculous endings I've ever seen. It just opened a lot of plot holes up. I won't reveal it here but that ending pretty much ruined everything for this film. Talk about absurdity!I must catch the original version with Sophie Marceau who probably would be more interesting to watch in this movie, though if the plot is similar (which it probably is) I don't know if I can endure it again.",The Tourist
134,littlemartinarocena,Something To Be Learned,2,12 December 2010,"Millions, two huge stars, a director with a reputation and a fictional sounding name, and of course, Venice! Nothing works, nothing! The chemistry between Depp and Jolie is virtually non existent. She is dressed in ridiculous, supposedly elegant, gowns but she looks as if she's wearing costumes. Remember Audrey Hepburn? She was never worn by her dresses, she was ahead. The dialog is not to be believed - Julian Fellowes is listed among the writers but, I can't believe it's true. The meet-cute on the train, done so beautifully in th past by a variety of directors and stars, falls flat here, flat! Johnny Depp is one of my favorites but here he looks puffy and detached. How can anyone managed to make Depp look bad? I don't know but they did. Jolie is a big star but here, she seems unused to wear dresses. I couldn't believe her walk through Venice. ""Hot to Trot"" comes o mind. Imagine, Audrey Hepburn walking purposely through Venice in a ball gown. Or Carole Lombard, or Grace Kelly, or Loren or Deneuve, Gene Tirney, Kay Kendall... I can think of dozens. This was really bad. The only saving grace a running joke that has Depp's character, not speaking Italian, speaks Spanish to the Italians and the Italians respond in Spanish, specially the scene with Christian De Sica (son of Vittorio) in which De Sica replays ""De nada"" So, the lesson learned is the eternal cliché.

135,georgioskarpouzas,uneven and unrealistic story redeemed by charming actors and scenery,6,19 January 2011,"The critics were negative on this film, which was difficult to believe given the couple of protagonists who were two individuals among the most pregnant with star quality in Western Cinema. When I saw the movie I gave credit to the critics- it is not a good movie:the story is unrealistic and twisted, the finale is bamboozling and implausible, the presentation of characters and nationalities is full of stereotypes of high-school level. Something is missing in this film by all means. It is hollow, superficial, far-fetched and many characters are not real people but caricatures to be found in comic-books and cartoons for adolescents.But I will not tell you to avoid this movie. Despite the impossible plot, it still has two very charming protagonists. The low key performance of Depp as the understated schoolteacher makes a fine antithesis with the super-glamorous presence of Angelina Jolie as Ms Cliffton-Ward. It is a sort of Princess and Pauper combination that works well. Also the scenery is fine. Venice, canals, luxurious hotels and palazzi, TGV, cris-crafts, cafés in Paris- as if you were reading a life-style magazine with Angelina Jolie posing as a supermodel.Does all of the above amount to a good film?-no it does not. The cast and the director may have created great expectations that have not been met-but the result is not negligible either. There may be a totally caricature villain in the person of the mob Baron with his Russian bodyguards, a persona of unredeemed evil who expresses himself through platitudinous pseudo-philosophical dicta which manifest his nihilistic world-view, buffoonish Italian carabinieri or corrupted Italian police inspectors. A whole gallery of mindless nationalistic stereotyping-but still there is a feast for the eye, as for example in the dance scene of Jolie and Depp in a Venetian palazzo, encircled by a glamorous coterie of men and women in fabulous clothes or in the French high speed train advancing through the Italian countryside and many others...There is also the presentation of French, British and Italian policemen of various levels of authority and competence. Paul Bettany has switched alliance from the role of the law-breaker Sillas in ""The Davinci Code"" to that of inspector Acheson, an ambitious, if hesitant and occasionally bullying Scotland Yard officer.There is an effort to present British policemen as overbearing towards their French and Italian colleagues, the last of whom get the worse press in this movie.Everything is tinged with hyperbole both the darkness of the evil as well as the glamour of the positive characters. Still if you are not much of an austere critic of art and you accept the implausible in order to be redeemed from the prosaic conventions of everyday life and attain the feeling that empathy with larger-than-life characters offers,this is a movie for you.

Right from the start its obvious that this is a cat and mouse game, with diversion and confusion, Elise is told and she knows that she is been followed as she is part of it all, she deliberately leaves a trail to be chased to tidy up the loose ends and start afresh. Clues are abound in this film for use observer to wait for the penny to drop and not to wait the final seconds of the movie. The other clever part of the movie is the ""Plot Device"" which is shoehorned into most movies either as a voice over, flashback or letter to explain any other information such as back story to help get you up to speed. The ""plot device"" here is yet another clever diversionary tactic. Remember the answer sometimes is just staring you in the face.

The Tourist is 90% Angelina Jolie looking stunning. Johnny Depp looks surprisingly paunchy, reminding me of a bearded chipmunk, sleepwalking through his role. The rather implausible plot invites dissection after viewing, as numerous gaping holes exist. The action/chase scenes are rather uninspired, feeling like outtakes from a lesser Bond installment. Still, the audience gets a taste of a locale seldom seen in American movies and there's some cute humor regarding Depp's inept choice of languages (although one might ask why he's not mistakenly reverting to Portugese vs. Spanish, another question best left alone until the lights come on).

147,jonnyhavey,A Relaxing Walk Through The Park,6,11 December 2010,"""The Tourist"" is a relaxing sometimes-bland romance flick with minute amounts of action and not the other way around. The film is much more like a classic 1930s romance movie than a modern action film today (but not as good). The love affair is between two of the biggest stars of Hollywood (Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp) in this classy mystery driven movie. Jolie plays the part of a mysterious British woman named Elise Clifton-Ward and shows off her sexy feminine flare. While in Paris, Elise is constantly being watched by a couple different groups of people when she receives a letter from her long lost love Alexander. Alexander is a wanted man by these groups of people and tells Elise to get on the next train heading to Venice to meet him. The letter also tells her to sit by a man on the train to buy some time and make the people following her think that it's him. Depp's character Frank Tupelo is an American tourist on his way to Venice for vacation after losing the love of his life. Elise picks him on the train entangling him into the affairs she is in. Frank falls in love with Elise in Venice and runs with her from the people hunting them. There are some surprises along the way as they answer to the question; who is Alexander? One of the most important decisions in movie making is choosing the cast. With this being said, ""The Tourist"" could not of done a better job casting than it did. Tom Cruise was originally cast as Frank followed by Sam Worthington, but in the end Johnny Depp was undoubtedly the best choice. The movie is all about Depp and his cheeky subtle comedy mixed with his acting talents. Not many actors or actresses are able to match up with Depp in a film unless he is casted alongside the beautiful and talented Angelina Jolie. This is not her best role and the chemistry between the two isn't the best, but their star power matches up very well. This is almost enough to make the average film into a decent film. Also, even though the film lacks action there are enough plot twists that keeps the film enjoyable and relaxing.The film does not live up to the hype that it has received in the past few weeks, but it does not deserve all of the bad rap that it has been getting since its release. The film is very slow and lacks action sequences. The film was misadvertised as an action movie causing many audiences to find themselves bored and disappointed. This is a love story causing a lot of the action moments to lack the flare found in an actual action movie. A lot of scenes just do not add up and are very confusing. A lot of the scenes don't hold any gravity in the overall out come of the film. The clever ending makes numerous scenes in the film very questionable as the entire story is turned on its head.The film suffers from the snowball effect causing its ratings to be very low. One person sees the film and gives it a very bad review and then another follows. It is harder to enjoy a movie once you hear that it is bad. The ""Tourist"" is an average film that had a lot expected of it because of its stars, but if you want a relaxing movie to see go see it in the theaters, otherwise you can wait for DVD. (Depp fans won't be disappointed)",The Tourist
148,montera_iulian,"Having a flat and boring script that should have went down the toilet, The Tourist is a complete borefest.",5,22 December 2010,"The Tourist? Maybe The Borefest! This movie is nowhere near being disappointing it just suck from start to finish. First of all, the story is full of clichés and bad lines. The characters could not make something remarkable thanks to the bad development. The dialogue in this film is not just poor but lame and forced. The pacing is also something that enrages the viewer. It really gets dull and boring. Too many scenes having nothing important to show but only pretty faces and long (could I say) stare-downs. At least Knight & Day had some decent action scenes to keep you interested in what was going on the screen. On the other hand, The Tourist tries to, somehow, give a twist at the end of this more than clicheic spy-film. However, the audience could predict the twist from the first 10 minutes of the movie. Isn't that marvelous? Speaking of pretty faces... What the hell was in Angelina's mind? This is one of her worst portrayals I've seen. To get what I'm saying I will ""characterize"" her performance by saying that half the movie she is continuously flirting either with the camera either with Depp and the other half she is posing for a magazine like Vogue. I mean, really? Not to mention Depp is in his mediocre days... I will admit that the characters were already bad written but still, they could have managed them a little bit better, some sort of passion and involvement were obviously not present in the making of this film.This movie however looks pretty good on film, too many close-face shots but overall it is really nice to see Venice like that. The problem though is with the music. Not only the movie looks boring but the music does not fit the atmosphere. It's either to tense for a scene which has no suspense whatsoever, or it tries to be too emotional for a scene which fails in being sentimental.Backed up by bad acting and a flat and boring script that should have went down the toilet, The Tourist is a complete borefest. This is like a MTV-Movie and I feel sorry for Depp wasting his time with this complete nonsense.",The Tourist

From the point that I figured out the ""twist"" I thought about how clueless this woman must have been to not recognize her lover's body, his private parts as supposedly he only got a new face(she did it with him while he was not quite frank 'Frank' and still didn't know?).

150,JaynaB,A charming film in the tradition of the '60s' great caper movies,9,10 April 2011,"This movie is beautiful visually, structurally, musically, with a plot as convoluted as any Helen MacInnes novel and stars who humanize the main characters gradually, easing us beneath their masks. Time very well spent if you enjoyed Michael Caine and Shirley Maclean in 'Gambit', or Cary Grant with Audrey Hepburn in 'Charade'.From the setup in the opening sequence through the final curtain, Angelina Jolie is radiant, a classic combination of strength and vulnerability with a distinctly 21st century style. As with Audrey Hepburn in 'Charade', I can imagine no other female star in this role. It is literally decades since I have seen a woman take the gloves off with such seductive grace.Johnny Depp is a masterpiece of bumbling charm as the tourist out of his depth. His comic turn on the rooftops of Venice is one for the ages. He changes mood and character with purely a shift in the intensity of gaze.Paul Bettany is firmly in character as the obsessed agent who will stop at nothing to get his man. Timothy Dalton's small role as his boss is most entertaining. The police in France and Italy are polished comic versions of the hapless agents in a Pink Panther movie. The villain is a dread villain indeed. Rufus Sewell looks fab in a tuxedo and I wish he had more screen time.The only reason I can think of for the lower rankings is that people expected to see lots of high-action sequences as in 'Wanted'. This is not that movie. The action is more Pink Panther than Jason Bourne.Venice is timeless in its elegance as usual. The lack of a gondola ride is a nice departure from tradition.All in all, a charming, beautiful movie that is worth rewatching.",The Tourist

Jolie played her role really well, she had such class and sophistication and it was great because at first you don't know if she is bad or not or if you should like her or not. Especially during the opening scene she had such a ""come and get it"" face which was interesting, she had a mystery about her which was intriguing. The plot was quite good, not hard to follow but not too easy or predictable, especially with the great twist at the end.

The Tourist's setting is somewhat wonderful, but it will be very useful if all the audience want to see is beautiful sceneries instead of a good developed story and fine acting.(Nominating Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie's performances for the Golden Globes is by far a great piece of evidence that the show just wants they stars to show up on their red carpet.)",The Tourist

I expected that they were going to do a flashback at the end showing Frank writing the note knowing that his arch nemesis would figure it out. (I've probably watched a little too much 'Leverage'.) If you let yourself relax and go with the flow you'll enjoy the movie but if you are expecting a Spy Thriller in the vein of Bourne Identity, you'll be disappointed.There were many CUTE little scenes that had me smiling, chuckling and sometimes outright laughing.

160,engelst,A pale shadow of the original,6,21 January 2011,"While watching The Tourist I discovered it's actually a remake of the French movie Anthony Zimmer. So this review will not be entirely unbiased, as I knew the plot while watching the movie.Comparing the two movies, The Tourist falls short in many ways.The biggest factor is the choice of main actors. Comparing Angelina Jolie to Sophie Marceau (who plays the main part in the original) is unfair because these two simply do not play in the same league. Jolie looks older than her age and is totally inept at transmitting the emotions that go with her role. Marceau, in a much simpler and less luxurious setting, was able to convey a realm of feelings. The gap between her and her ""random"" travel partner is in the first stages enormous because it is unimaginable that such a woman would fall for such a man. Gradually that changes, until we're surprised by the final plot twist. Here, however, the payload is not unrealistic but is carried by the performance of the actors, especially Marceau's. When it comes to Johnny Depp, an actor I consider to be vastly overrated, he actually makes something of the role and turns out not to be a bad cast at all. The biggest drawback is that the choice of such a big name somewhat spoils the plot because we are aware that there is more to him than we are told. He has to have an important role, and thus he's more than just a teacher from Wisconsin.Another flaw of The Tourist is its lack of humour. The original is funnier while at the same time having more suspense. I think this is because the director and the screenwriter haven't fully managed to develop the plot in the new setting, especially in respect to character interaction and timing.The Tourist left me with a bland aftertaste. So much action, so much luxury, a huge cast and so forgetful the end result.",The Tourist
161,sanddragon939,Definitely no masterpiece...but an enjoyable ride nonetheless!,9,31 December 2010,"In an era of 'intelligent' thrillers like the Jason Bourne films or Salt, one all too often forgets that the primary purpose behind a movie's existence is one thing and one thing only: Entertainment. And 'The Tourist' most definitely entertains.The plot is simple enough, yet its elegant treatment doesn't fail to intrigue the viewer. Elise Ward (Angelina Jolie) travels to Venice to rendezvous with her lover, Alexander Pearce, a banker who embezzled billions of dollars from his crimelord employer, and is now a fugitive not only from Scotland Yard's Financial Crimes Division, but also from Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff), the afforementioned crimelord. In order to misdirect Alexander's pursuers, Elise befriends Frank Tempello (Johnny Depp), an American tourist and her co-passenger the train to Venice, with the hope of convincing both authorities and gangsters alike that Tempello is Alexander and thus to throw them off the trail. Frank, the hapless schoolteacher from Wisconin, soon finds himself the target of numerous assassins, with his only ally the woman who got him into this mess in the first place. Elise, for her part, is torn between her loyalty to Alexander and her growing feelings for Frank. The two major plot twists are not entirely unpredictable, though one of them might be considered somewhat far-fetched, albeit laden with irony in retrospect.Where the film really stands out is atmosphere. The scenic beauty of Venice, its buildings, waterways and ballrooms is complemented by a score which, while over the top in some respects, is pleasing to the ear and does evoke the sense of exaggerated intrigue about this film. The main actors don't do too badly as well. Jolie's portrayal of Elise as a sophisticated, seductive and mysterious English woman is certainly one of the high points of the movie. Paul Bettany plays the hard-as-nails obsessively deranged Scotland Yard Inspector Acherson pretty well, and Steven Berkoff does stand out in his hilariously over the top portrayal of Reginald Shaw, and is somewhat reminiscent of James Bond villains from the 60's and 70's. Less impressive however is Johnny Depp, who is clearly better off sticking to comedic maniacs like Jack Sparrow and the Mad Hatter than he is with relatively serious parts like Frank Tempello. As he bumbles through most of the film, Depp's character ends up becoming no more than comedic relief, and not a very effective one at that. Indeed, Depp's inadequacies in this movie is one of the major setbacks 'The Tourist' faces.Still, this is definitely a movie worth watching if one has a quite free afternoon and wants to enjoy a thriller without the complications of having to figure out an intensely 'cerebral' plot.",The Tourist

163,GLanoue,Watchable but not memorable,5,27 March 2011,"There's a fine line between being cool and being catatonic, and Depp crosses it. There is nothing in the movie or in the back story to makes us believe that an alleged math teacher from Wisconsin, a Cheesehead no less, could play it so cool around a) Jolie, if not supremely beautiful then at least supremely desirable; b) Venice, certainly one of the great film locales of all time; c) Steven Berkoff and a bunch of Russian bad boys, who certainly look the part enough to make anyone rethink what they thought they knew about ""bad"". The problem, I think, is Jolie. Depp has certainly the charm and charisma to play against anybody, but Jolie poshes up too much. It's as if the director and producers don't really know what elite beauties look and act like. They certainly don't act like Jolie. Jolie plays it, or is told to play it, like how a beauty school dropout imagines the hoi polloi, a cinematic version of The Cosmo Girl, Sex in the City Carrie on steroids. Brief, she is simply not believable, nor is the script. Jolie conveys insufficient depth of character to make us believe that underneath all the shenanigans her character is playing to throw the police off the scent of her fiancé, she could in fact fall for supercriminal Alexander as well as super boring Frank the Cheesehead math teacher on vacation (but, what a twist, you'll never guess what ties the two together). And the script is stupid enough to sabotage her, since it has the dogged police investigator (well played by Paul Bettany, but this is becoming the unfortunate norm for these 100m dollar films, that the supporting cast outshines the stars) explain to Frank that Angelina/Elise falls in love with every man with which she spends more than a few hours. So she's in movieland fact a bimbo or an idiot, but certainly not Super Angelina woman of mystery/femme fatale/undercover agent. As usual, a bad script combined with the leads' inflated salaries means unmotivated acting and directing. Depp is not exactly dialling it in, but doesn't have enough narrative material to flesh out his character. Angelina is clearly chosen on the basis of looks and not nuance and, as I said, her interpretation of a high class beauty is almost a parody, on the verge of being akin to a little girl's wearing mommy's high heels to her ""elegant"" doll's house tea party (strangely, her natural beauty is not enhanced by the high fashion ensembles she wears throughout the movie; it's as if the clothes wear her, and not the other way around; a perfect mannequin, no doubt, but hardly credible here). A pleasant enough film, given the locales, good supporting actors, and occasional flashes of humour (""Buon giorno"", to which Depp replies ""Bon Jovi"") all mean that it's not entirely wasted time, but the sketchy plot and formulaic ending which most people can anticipate about ten minutes into the movie certainly don't provide a real challenge.

It was supposed to be a romantic/spy/comedy thingy and Johnny Depp was in it, and he doesn't really do that kind of thingy -- at least not in a straightforward way. So the movie and the premise was a little mocking, a little off kilter, a little slapstickish, and little straightforwardish, and overall entertaining because of it all. They stole bits and pieces here and there from some of the others in that genre from the 50's/60's/70's and ran with it. No, it wasn't Breakfast at Tiffany's (though Jolie's demeanor reminded you of it), nor To Catch a Thief (though there was thievery to be had), nor A Fish Called Wanda (though there was water and I'm assuming fish in that water). But it was still very enjoyable and moved along nicely. I was kept giggling without meaning to for a good part of the movie (and I'm not made to giggle by just anything, especially not by dumb than dumber storylines), while made to feel some consternation at other times, so I'm a happy camper. I'd give it a solid 7.4 out of 10 if I could, but only rounded decimals are allowed here.To paraphrase what some reviewers said, it was a tasty little piece of froth that slid down nicely.

165,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: The Tourist,5,5 June 2011,"Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie, star in this action romance as Frank and Elise. Whilst on a vacation to Italy to recover from a broken heart, Frank a maths teacher, is minding his own business on a train when Elsie sits opposite him. They strike up a bond and Frank thinks its his lucky day when he runs into her later. Unfortunately for him, this is not a chance encounter but rather a scheme by Elise to use him as a decoy as protection for her lover Alexander Pearce who is a wanted man.As no-one knows what Alexander looks like Frank finds himself in the middle of an intentional misunderstanding that puts him in the firing line of mobsters, from whom a large sum of money has been stolen and the British government for tax evasion led by Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) and Scotland Yard's John Acheson (Paul Bettany) The main flaw is that this movie contains the top A-list celebrities of Hollywood, director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck and is all set in the lovely city of Venice implying that it will be a feast to behold. The standards have been set high. Yet not only did I find the movie to be obvious in its direction- I was never sitting on the edge of my seat waiting or even wanting to see what was going to happen next but there was no chemistry between Depp and Jolie at all.It was good to see Depp as a 'normal' character and by that I mean he wasn't draped in make-up and he did not see to have any extreme character flaws or quirks that usually accompany his other roles. He was the one who kept the movie interesting for me. However, I didn't fully understand Bettany's character. Granted he has some sort of vendetta against Pearce but he just didn't seem believable and was overly obsessed to the point he would have been issued with some gross misconduct charges.The action scenes are well done and the settings impressive but you get the sense that the film hasn't worked out if it's a comedy, action or a romance. Yes a movie can be all three but The Tourist fails to seam them altogether leading to the viewer becoming somewhat detached from the storyline. And why they found it necessary to put Jolie in a stunning dress for every scene with people gawping at her is beyond me. Don't get me wrong, I like a bit of eye candy but it turned the movie into something more akin to a perfume commercial or catwalk show instead of a film.At the end, although I was reasonably entertained whilst watching it, I now feel no real desire to see it ever again. Venice and its buildings add a nice visual appeal to the film but I needed more than that to keep me interested. Wait for it's appearance on the TV if you have any desire to see it.For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com",The Tourist

Gee, I wonder if Jolie and Depp will end up together?It is such a shame to see this kind of money spent on a story not worth telling. Johnny Depp is trying so very hard to portray an 'average Joe' type American. In this effort he only makes a fool of himself. Its almost laugh-out-loud BAD at times. Watching him patter across a tiled roof in pajamas away from the baddies is very comical, but you are laughing 'at' not 'with'. It is around this time that the convoluted plot unravels. Money owed here, gangster there, and of course there are good guys undercover. It lurches from chase sequence to revelation, chase sequence to revelation ... wake me when its over. Underneath the subterfuge and plainly obvious love-story the plot is just a little weak. Something is a little off kilter with Depp in this film ... pasty complexion, dyed facial hair. There's just the slightest hint of formaldehyde ... is he starting down that plastic surgery path?Jolie is neither good nor bad; demure, poised, convincing accent and of course very attractive, but she doesn't steal any scenes.

168,lekgolah,Lacks the substance that would have made it worth while,5,20 February 2011,"The idea of casting Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp together is admittedly not a bad one, despite the fact it came more from financial reasons as they both manage to bring in big audiences with their films. Combining this with the location of Venice, this could have been a fabulous film to watch where it not for poor cinematography, sub-par storytelling, an uninteresting script, forgettable characters, the list goes on.Its fair to say that there is a lot that is wrong with The Tourist, a remake of a foreign film. Clearly it was aiming to be like an Alfred Hitchcock film, that is a given fact but I feel bad comparing a geniuses work with this, a painfully dull film that tries to be entertaining.The only real credit I can give the film other than an amusing performance by Johnny Depp is that the action never becomes over-the-top but maybe if it was then it might have been more enjoyable. There is only one real 'action' sequence that involves Johnny Depp in a boat while it is being shot at. There is also a light-hearted chase along the Venice roof-tops but the film isn't to be taken seriously. However if it isn't, then shouldn't it be more enjoyable?What really undermines the film is the script. Were it more lively and interesting, it would have made up for all of the films other shortcomings. There are scenes where had the script been on the level, the film would have felt alive and have become a pleasure to watch. Instead it is dull. There is nothing worth hating the film about but it plays everything too safe.The supporting cast are completely miss-used. Paul Bettany is a good actor and does a decent job here but there is one scene where he plays a joke on Depp's character, which felt pointless. His role amounts to very little but running around Venice trying to make sense of everything. Rufus Swell and Timothy Dalton appear in the film but there casting felt like an effort to build up the stars involved as they have nothing to do. I could dissect the film until their is nothing left but if you are in search of some light- entertainment, this is for you but I recommend that you rent it.

(No, he meant ravenous, actually, but he was to much of a gentleman to insist on the idea....)This is the classic story of boy meats girl, boy falls in love with girl. Which makes us wonder when do they find the time - in this case - because the Russian Mafia is after them. The police is after them. The Cosa Nostra is after them. The Hell's Angels are after them. The Second Presbyterian Order is after them. And finally, the Interpol is after everybody.The movie starts just like any good movie would start: with a stakeout. In Paris. Then it slowly (very, very slowly) proceeds to introduce everybody by name, rank and social security number. And by the time it finishes doing that, in Venice, everybody in the audience is bored to death and wondering what's for diner.The script seems to have been forgotten in a drawer somewhere, and would have been much more at home in another era. Or maybe it wanted to be a tribute to the work of the brilliant and famous - but sadly dead and therefore unavailable - Italian directors? Or was it the French ones? Anyway. The pace is slow and the dialog seems to have been left up to the actors hence... there isn't any.The scenery is beautiful, the colors are brilliant, the composition is fantastic, there isn't a speck of dust in sight, the skies are always clear (heck!, even the murky water of Venice is crystal clear), the music is OK, the camera work is good and the colors are pretty (wait, I already said that, never mind). The actors don't have much to do except look pretty, there are some wonderful glimpses of a rich and carefree world we don't see too often these days and... that's it!I still don't understand why they spent 100 million on this movie. Sure, Timothy Dalton and Rufus Sewell both have great little cameos but... they couldn't have asked for that much. Could they?The Tourist.

173,TourettesPersonal,Not A Thriller,5,15 January 2011,"What we know about ""The Tourist"" is it's a spy thriller starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. We would definitely expect a lot of action and suspense. But instead we get a romantic comedy. Well, the movie doesn't look too serious. It has no suspense. It barely has an action scene. So much humor coming along and the romantic story of Elise(Jolie) and Frank(Depp). I don't think Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is the kind of director who should be doing a thriller. I think the kind of movie he should make is romance or drama. ""The Tourist"" isn't bad. We just don't know what is the true genre. By the way if you are here for the stars then it's okay, but if you are seeking for action and suspense then skip this.""The Tourist"" is another movie I saw that has too much explained story, and very slow pacing and it could be boring if you are an action fanatic. Yes, there's nothing suspenseful about this film it's just a romantic comedy drama thing. Even if Donnersmarck tries to make a scene suspenseful it still fail. James Newton Howard's sappy music score also kills the suspense of this film. The climax of this film is very predictable, underwhelming, and dragging. But when Timothy Dalton (Aka James Bond) came to save the day, the scene becomes cool but it lasts too quickly.The good things I can say about ""The Tourist"" is the production design is quite fabulous. And the appearance of Timothy Dalton like I say, saves the dull unexciting climax. Playing Muse in the end credits also saves the ending. Prepare to be disappointed if you are expecting Angelina Jolie to kick-ass in this film because the only kick-ass thing she did in this film is kissing Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp is just playing an extraordinary innocent guy in this film and there is nothing bad about that.""The Tourist"" isn't terrible. It's just mediocre. Seriously I wonder who is expecting too much about this film. Maybe the fans of Jolie and Depp. If you are a fan of the stars in this film then you won't hate it that much. You will only hate it if you want suspense and something less absurd or you are an easily offended guy named Frank. I have to disagree with Golden Globes because this movie isn't special, or memorable. It's not great or bad. It's just another blockbuster released in our cinemas!",The Tourist

And if you haven't seen this badly misunderstood film once, go ahead and read this anyway.This film needs to be saved. If every professional reviewer had seen this film TWICE, not once, I think it would have been announced with very favorable reviews, and better box office. In a sense, this film is an argument for the asymetrcial non-linear final cutting that Quentin Tarantino is most famous for. If only the audience knew what the characters knew or didn't know at the time, they would see a different film. Think there's little or no chemistry between Jolie and Depp? Watch the film the second time, and whammo, there it is. Did you think the artificial non-tobacco cigarette was a distracting triffle, silly to the film? Not when you know the truth revealed in the ending of the movie. Think the Depp character was too nerdy to attract the gorgeous Jolie's attention? EXACTLY !! And it worked!Spoilers SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS But read this ANYWAY!!The never seen genius had to concoct a scheme to get the money, get the girl, kill the gangsters, and appease the police. In order to do this, the unseen genius had to re-invent himself as the ultimate nerd, so convincing, he would convince EVERYONE that he was the new image, and not the genius below. Everyone including the girl had to buy what he was selling. He wanted to be with Jolie to spend the enormous ill gotten gains with her, so he would find the meaning in life he wanted. The meaning that the character saw evaded the rich gangster, and the inflated ego driven Interpol agent after him. And once you've seen the film once, on the second time, then and only then will you see the genius at work. Because the genius not only sold himself as a nerd to the killers, the police and the girl, he sold the audience too. So everyone is wondering how can we believe the nerd can win a Jolie? And when will he get killed, being in so over his head? Watch carefully the second time, and you'll see every subtle move that Depp invents to push along his plot, and convince the others he's a nerd. The genius throws in just enough to reel in Jolie to his love, while still selling himself to everyone, including Jolie's character, that he's a nerd.Have you wondered why Jolie's husband Brad Pitt, with whom she has the greatest of screen chemistries, was not cast in the part? Simple. He's too damn good looking. Impossible for Pitt, I don't care how much make-up they apply to make him look worse, could come off as the nerd who still wins the heart of the girl. Depp can and did pull this off. And only those who see the film twice will see that.",The Tourist

They all had Cary Grant playing against actresses like Eve Marie Saint, Grace Kelly and Audry Hepburn. This one has Johnny Depp, which could probably have worked, except unfortunately he's up against Angelina Jolie. Now she may be a star, but she was never much of an actress. She starred in two movies based on a computer game, both of them cheap copies of Indiana Jones, where all she had to do was running round in shorts and tank tops and kicking ass. Then she made a movie with Brad Pitt, they got married, and now she was definitely a star. But in a movie like this it takes more than good looks to make it work and there's simply no chemistry at all between Depp and her. So the romance angle dies there. But there must be some fun and action surely ? Well we get Depp being chased over the roofs in Venice dressed in pyjamas and a boat chase in the Canals, where the bad guys on foot manage to overtake the boat at every bridge, and that's pretty much it. The plot is pretty simple although they try to make it seem complicated by throwing a few not too surprising twists into it. The script and dialogue are weak, and the director doesn't do anything to make up for it.

179,youngman44,"Light, Fun Fare - Could have Improved",7,10 December 2010,"I thought The Tourist was close to what I expected. Interestingly, a woman sitting near us after the film said she expected another ""Salt"" or ""Lara Croft."" But, that really wasn't warranted given the previews. This is a film, as one LA Times writer noted, in the vein of the old Cary Grant thief dramas. I like this genre. And, both Jolie and Depp were quite good in their roles. Paul Bettany, a quality role actor, played a character that was a bit too grading and not quite endearing enough. Depp was exceptional at communicating the vulnerability of the American Tourist. His acting skills are not lacking and the character was fairly well written. Acting - 8.5-9.0; Writing - 6.5-7.0. Jolie - was, as usual, gorgeous. She is among the most beautiful and elegant looking women in the world. Just showing up on screen with those lips and eyes is worth a 7 without a word uttered. Incomparable. But, she pulled off her role as a beauty who is confident, toying with vulnerable & insecure Depp, yet also not entirely in control of her circumstances. I do wish, without giving anything away, that things had ended just a bit differently. The final outcome - never really in doubt given it was essentially a two-character film with supporting cast - was what one wished. But, this film could have been improved with a different twist than the director put on the movie. It actually disappointed me a bit and knocked it down to a 7 out of 10 range. Had the writing been a bit more imaginative than it was - I think this would have been a film worthy of an 8 to 8.5 range film.",The Tourist

There really needed to be MORE dialogue between the main characters, and MORE WIT therein.But otherwise, I enjoyed watching Johnny Depp play a dorky tourist.

Remember watching all those clever Hitchcock movies in which, contrary to others of his, Ole Hitch would make a quirky, funny thriller? Well, this movie attempts to be that, only fails to clear the jump. We sit through an hour and twenty minutes of boring silliness only to end up with another 20 minutes of slightly less silliness. Depp is FAR from his best here, but is the only redeeming quality. Aside from seeing Timothy Dalton again (who,
incidentally, is incredibly under-rated as an actor due to his failure at Bond, James Bond), this was a yawner. Did you ever see the Three's company episode where there's a misunderstanding at the beginning and they all act stupid for 20 minutes? (There's a joke there - all 3's Company episodes were as such), well, this was the movie version. Sure, there's a plot twist or two, without which this could easily have been straight to video, or rather in these days straight to streaming Netflix or bargain bin on-demand. Too bad.....I hope Depp doesn't go the way of De Niro and start pumping out stinker after stinker. Note to Johnny: Your craft is up there with Daniel day Lewis, my personal favorite. Pass on these less cerebral ones and go quality - not quantity.

That's probably why a lot of reviewers thought this was a serious thriller--NO. It's a romantic comedy.Angelina was looking exquisite and her accent matched that of Elizabeth Hurley I thought. She is a fine actress even when she plays light-hearted comedy. Johnny Depp, looking overweight and gawky fits his character perfectly.There are giveaways: why doesn't he question her as soon as things start to go wrong? And that suggests a twist at the end (too easy to spot if you think romantic comedy).And what a location. Venice: I want to go there after seeing this and stay at the same hotel Ha ha ha! In my dreams. No really, it looks a lovely city -- foundered because people were scared of Atilla the Hun.In summary.

185,jgregg42,"""The Tourist"" Should Have Stayed Home This Year.",4,10 December 2010,"""The Tourist"" is a European romantic-comedy-action-espionage film starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. Taking a simple story the director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, focuses on too many genres. He adds in a plot twist that the average movie watcher will figure out within the first 15 minutes of the film. Beginning in Paris we watch as an entire team of Interpol field agents follow a graceful, mysterious woman, Elise (played by Jolie), from her apartment to an outdoor cafe to order her morning tea. This shot only took a couple of minutes and was comparable to watching paint dry. Elise has a secret contact who is wanted by both the Russian mob and Interpol. This secret contact, Alexander Pierce, has embezzled a large sum of money from the mob. It only makes sense that Elise is romantically involved with him. At the cafe Elise receives a courier message from Pierce ordering her to go to a train station. There she must find a man that looks similar to Pierce in order to throw Interpol off his trail. With about as much action as reading an instruction manual, she makes her way to the train station and loses her Interpol tail. Through surveillance wizardry Interpol finds out what train she will be on and already has agents following her. Once on the train Elise picks a random man out of all the passengers on this particular train and takes seat in his booth. Elise seductively introduces herself to Frank (played by Depp), a meek math teacher from Wisconsin who enjoys spy novels and smoking electronic cigarettes. Elise insistently yet seductively tells Frank how to talk to women and how to ask her to dinner on the train.Once they arrive at Venice Frank becomes a perfect decoy for Elise's plan. In the one evening they spend together Frank starts to develop feelings for Elise while they share a hotel room (don't ask why they didn't rent two rooms). The story line does have some class; Frank sleeps on the couch that night. The next morning Frank finds himself being chased over the Venice rooftops by the Russian mob as they think Frank is Pierce. He eventually ends up in the hands of a dirty cop. Elise reappears to save Frank through a slow boat chase. I have seen swimmers do the breast stroke faster than these boats move on the Venice canals.The couple parts ways but find each other at a grand ball. Frank shows Elise how assertive he can be, but at the wrong time because he destroying her plan to reunite with her old flame. They share a dance, and while they have an intimate conversation these strangers both know every dance step needed at this grand ball. Eventually the paths of Frank, Elise, Interpol, the mob and Pierce all cross paths in a hotel room. By the time the groups meet, the audience should already have seen what is going to happen about an hour earlier. Should you see this movie? No. The story refused to challenge the viewer. The acting was fine, unfortunately there was little on-screen chemistry between Jolie and Depp. You might want to see it if you have never been to Italy and want to see some beautiful shots of the canals and the architecture. But, you could also flip through a travel magazine to see those images.",The Tourist

I have discovered this is a remake of a European film and lately I have learned that other films I have watched are remakes of Euro films. All I can say is that there must obviously be great movies made outside Hollywood.And if you are going to relocate a movie made in mainland Europe, do not imagine there are British equivalents of the fiscal/tax police they have in Europe.And if there were, the rank of the officer in charge played by Dalton to try and recoup almost £740m would be considerably above Chief Inspector.

190,Ben_Horror,Johnny + Angie = some good old fashioned star power,10,13 December 2010,"Sometimes with the vast amount of special effects extravaganzas, monsters movies and super hero vehicles going around, you can't help but get a bit bored with them after a while. They have a numbing effect the brain and they can get very tedious. As viewers we need a break occasionally. That's why it's always nice just to sit back, relax and watch a straightforward story where good actors do what they're trained for: act. Without a CG creature in sight And that's exactly what we get here: two good actors having a great time with a slight, though still extremely entertaining and watchable story.Johnny plays a lonely guy called Frank who, while on holiday in Europe, is approached on a train by a mysterious and beautiful woman called Elise (Angie – who else). Little does he know, however, he's actually being used by her as a decoy to shift police attention from her lover - a financial 'whizz-kid' who ripped off a scummy criminal and now owes the British government over 700 million euros in taxable funds. In a case of mistaken identity, the angry criminals assume Frank to be her thieving lover and he ends up being plunged into a whole web of intrigue, pursued by both the cops and the robbers. At the same time, he's trying to battle his own increasing infatuation with the enigmatic Elise, who keeps ditching him at every turn, but who - in the grand tradition of romps such as this - keeps ending up being thrown into dire situations with him, despite her best efforts. This is a rather sophisticated and old-fashioned movie and its all the better for it. It would be easy to imagine this being made in 60s with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn starring in the lead roles. As Frank, Johnny Depp - who really does look about ten years younger than his actual age - once again shows us why he's one of the best out there. It's easy to imagine George Clooney – surely the aforementioned Grant's heir - playing this role, but Depp is more effective and brings a more earthy quality, able to play both plain and debonair at the drop of a hat. Similarly, Angelina Jolie is convincing as the conflicted mystery woman Elise, and puts in a nice understated performance while at the same time never looking better. The chemistry between them flows off the screen. In fact the interplay between them for the first 40 minutes is absolutely brilliant. You know something is good when simply the sight of two people conversing is keeping you entertained.It's a jet setter of a story, mixing a bit of James Bond with a dozen mistaken identity movies. It's lightly Hitchcockian, but in a good way, though it probably wouldn't have been as effective had it had been set completely in the United States. As with the Bourne movies, the European locales prevent it from being just another run-of-the-mill thriller while adding something romantic and unique to it. The photography is gorgeous and the film itself ends up being a good advert for European tourism as all the locations come off looking magnificent. The story moves along fast and there's plenty of engaging action sequences, the stand out being one involving boats. The supporting cast is good, though Paul Bettany has a somewhat thankless role that requires him to do little more than be grumpy while at the same time barking down a microphone at every available occasion. But it is good to see Timothy Dalton (the best Bond bar none) in an acting role again. Even if it only ranks as an extended cameo, he dominates the screen whenever he's on. Somewhat appropriately, he's even in the position his boss 'M' was in his own Bond movies - a guy who sits behind a desk handing out the missions and giving all the orders rather than taking them. It's almost like James Bond has been promoted to top dog! There's also another Bond connection (are all these intentional?) in another supporting player Steven Berkoff, who played a slimy Russian general in 1983's Octopussy. Here he plays a similarly depraved and ruthless criminal who's actually British, but surrounds himself with a pack of Russian heavies. He also has the most sadistic scene in a movie that can't really be classed as being overly violent.Even if it's not the kind of dark Euro thriller you might be expecting, this is still a very entertaining movie that will keep you hooked all the way. It's got everything: action, suspense, comedy and romance. And even if that's not enough for you, certainly the interplay between Depp and Jolie will be. They're really effective in this and display the kind of chemistry we haven't seen since the heyday of the movies, the most recent example probably being Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner. Based on this, hopefully they'll work together again sometime in the near future. Yes, it's all very old-fashioned stuff and you will feel like you're caught in a time warp to the 60s. It's also a bit lightweight and fluffy, but you know what? When you have a cast this good, just go with it. I enjoyed very minute of it. And if you give it a chance, you will too.",The Tourist

You get an award-winning director, two stars like Depp and Jolie (I'm a fan of both), and a successful French movie (Anthony Zimmer) to remake. Couldn't go wrong... but the result is awful! Depp is lame in every scene, as if he was thinking of something else. The timing of the cuts are often bad, as if the camera caught the actors off guard, or as if they picked the worst take to put in the final edit... Jolie looks artificial from start to finish, a ""Sophia Loren wannabee"". Loren can act (see ""Arabesque""), and so can Jolie, but it seems the director got it all wrong. He managed to get the worst performance ever out of both Jolie and Depp. OK, he's German (not the best comedians) and known for drama (""The Life of Others""). Not everybody can direct an elegant comedy like Stanley Donen or William Wyler. It proves that getting a bunch of talented people together and a good script is still not enough to make a good film... The people who liked ""The Tourist"" are lacking finesse. The film is supposed to be a homage to the elegant films of the 60's, but it lacks the elegance of the originals.

192,tokanac,Absolutely awful and unbelievable!,1,28 November 2016,"Let me start off by saying that when one of our local television networks was airing this (again), I was really excited to be able to see it, especially since I haven't seen it before, despite it being aired numerous times. I was thoroughly disappointed, though, as 'the Tourist' is one of the worst movies out there, containing a lot of badly shot clichés! Angelina Jolie was dressed in costumes, not regal clothes, and Johnny Depp's clothes weren't that much different, either. The film was badly cast; the two lead characters should be believable both as people and love interests, and Jolie and Depp met neither requirement. Jolie was not believable as a Brit, especially as she couldn't pull off the accent, even if her life depended on it, and she had absolutely no on-screen chemistry with Depp; they were both just conveniently (or inconveniently) put there, and they were going through the motions, not really believing what they were doing.I could tell that the resort scene was supposed to be the scene where Depp realises that he's falling for Jolie's character, and though you got the romance, the scene didn't really happen. Again, they're just going through the motions; no real emotion behind it.I didn't watch the entire movie from start to finish, as it was so boring and I was so tired; it wasn't worth staying up and losing sleep over it! I cannot believe that this movie managed to scrape up a rating of '6.0'; it's so not worth it!Let me finish by saying that I will not be watching the movie again; it'd be a waste of time! Sorry for the rant, but this is a truthful account of how I feel.",The Tourist
193,hendry-robert,Should have gone straight to DVD,1,29 January 2011,"Why Angelina still gets parts in any movie is quite frankly beyond me. I can conjure up theories such as being partnered with Brad Pitt, adopting half of Africa, and being some sort of ambassador for the third world. Her standing cannot be for her acting abilities for she has none. She neither has an ounce of on screen presence, magic, whatever you want to call it.Depp on the other hand had made many great movies and has bags of on screen magic. I'm particularly partial to his much lesser known work. I like Depp because he takes risks,and obviously cares for the art of film making. But a risk on this project has done him no favours at all. Perhaps the money was just to good to refuse, or perhaps he was concerned about being type cast as a Pirate. Who knows. But for sure he will be deeply embarrassed by this nonsense of a movie.I feel it pointless to describe what's wrong with it. Many others have done that already. Anyone who actually likes has no clue what a good movie is.It should have gone straight to DVD and given away free with the morning newspaper.Expect to see this movie in the bargain bin very soon.",The Tourist

Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp portray both a mystery and vulnerability as a couple cast together by possible accident.
Scenes of Paris and much of Venice star alongside as the film unwinds, much of the dialogue thoughtful and quiet. There's a baddie, and a few twists and turns--in the end making this movie a very entertaining evening's enjoyment.",The Tourist
196,Syxiepoo,What a stylish movie this is,9,17 May 2011,"Having read a couple of reviews, particularly the prime one above, I suppose I could have been forgiven if I'd chosen not to watch this film. That would have been a great loss for me. There are a good many conventional romantic mystery/action/adventure movies around at present, none of which I have found to be quite as enjoyable as I found The Tourist to be. It was elegant, it was amusing, Venice never fails to impress and the leads and supports were at times quite surprising, but always excellent.Some might say that I am undemanding. In fact, I am quite demanding of anything that will take an hour or two of my valuable time. However, I do simply want to be entertained well and this movie did just that for me. Added to that, of course, Ms Jolie was, as always, never less than magnificent.Please don't miss this very charming and engaging movie. You'll regret it if you do.Just watched this again and I stand by my first review. However, I'd now give it 9/10",The Tourist

The police have been following Elise for two years waiting for her to contact her lover who embezzled over $2 Billion. Not only will they need to evade the police, but also the mobster whose money he stole.First of all,I must say that this movie was entertaining.For big action starts like Jolie and Depp,it was that one thing that the movie lacked.At times I wanted to say ""Damn Jolie please just pick up a gun and shoot someone"" HOWEVER this is not the role either actors played.We must remember that both Jolie and Depp have a family and have done some of their own stunts for films.They aren't getting any younger so they will more than likely stray from the heavy action roles and into the roles which keep you thinking.That is another thing I loved about this movie.Besides the lovely views of Venice and Angelina Jolie looking damn stunning,the movie had really intriguing twists and constantly had you thinking about Alexander Pierse.I also think Angelina Jolie is great at the roles that keep you guessing and this movie did that very well.At times the movie would have seemed to be going rather slow but the music played kept it really interesting,so great job to the sound editor.The Tourist may not be an action packed blockbuster however it was entertaining and enjoyable to see Jolie and Depp step out of their comfort zone with respect to acting, and do very well in the other area.So screw the critics and go see this movie because there is a great plot and Jolie and Depp did very well.",The Tourist

I was surprised to discover her ""true"" character.It's great to see Depp portray someone other than a pirate or crazy person. I think he enjoyed the role and change as well. There is a shocker when it comes to his character as well (and that's all I'll reveal).Please I implore you to not prejudge this film based on what you've read from critics and other reviews on this site.

201,keith-w8888,Excellent vehicle for Jolie's ego,1,21 January 2013,"OK, so everyone knows it was a disaster, but it would be good to hear what the 'creative differences' were that caused Sam Worthington to drop out. He would have been better in the role than Johnny Depp. No disrespect intended because I like Johnny Depp a lot and he does such good comedy roles, and it's not that the he plays this badly, he doesn't, but it's the lack of director foresight that leaves you so disappointed at the end. There are no clues at all towards the 'twist' in the plot, but by the time it is revealed the whole thing has become so lame that it looks just like and ego yank for Angelina Jolie. It's as if it is nothing more than a succession of scenes which entails Jolie getting dressed up in posh frocks (designer dresses) so she can walk into the various rooms followed by the admiring glances of all the men in the room. In her dreams. And when the do have the opportunity to have all her clothes fall off in one scene, they don't bother, because to do so would be to reveal the saggy, middle aged carcass of a vain woman too lazy exercise. It's not too late for Cameron Diaz, her clothes can still fall off and without the use of a body double, she'd still look hot because she gym's it all the time and it shows. So Angelina, there's the challenge for you, Meg Ryan and Sandra Bullock embarrassed themselves and the public by stripping off long after the point, so we think it's time you did it as well. Go on, you're vain enough...",The Tourist
202,suicidalicecreamtruckdriver,Style over substances and thrills in this snore fest,4,10 March 2011,"The Tourist is the sort of movie that you would take someone who likes lush scenery and a picture- perfect backdrop. There is really nothing wrong with that- but all films need to show a degree of substance to be considered a film to be worth watching. This movie falls flat. It's far too focused on being viewed as 'old-Hollywood style' that it is a film with no action at all. But judging from the plot-involving spies and governments, it is reasonable to expect a couple of action scenes. It's dull, boring and has drowned in its own pretensions that it will only ever be seen as a 'nice' movie. It is occasionally funny and it's most interesting scene is a scene in which Johnny Depp's character is running, but apart from that it is a boring, dull film. Whilst one can say that the film shows signs of it being sophisticated but that does not save this film, which is a shame due to the talented leads. If you like nice clothes, nice scenery and acting by nice people, I'd recommend this movie to you. But a movie that is advertised as a thriller, it lacks any form of grit. Overall: 4/10",The Tourist
203,musanna-ahmed,Fans of the The Lives of Others will be disappointed. And the fans of Johnny Depp. Oh and don't forget the fans of Angelina Jolie too.,4,11 December 2010,"The Tourist is a remake of the French film Anthony Zimmer and is the second major film directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The first being the critically acclaimed German drama film The Lives of Others back in 2006 which was a remarkable debut for the director as it garnered just over 80 award nominations, winning 61 including an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and a BAFTA Film Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. If any of you fans of The Lives of Others were hoping for another masterpiece by the directorwell, this film did not live up to your expectations.The Tourist starts off by introducing Elise (Angelina Jolie) – a femme fatale who is having every move she takes watched by the French and British Police in their hope to have her meet with husband Alexander Pearce so they can then attempt to capture him. Pearce is not only wanted by the police for the $774 million he owes in taxes but also a mobster (Steven Berkoff) for his embezzlement of around 2 billion dollars. After receiving a letter from Pearce which asks to find someone of roughly the same height and same build as him, Elise goes off to find an alternate partner to conceal the real Pearce from the pursuing authorities. On a train trip one day, she sits down next to a random man who is introduced as Frank (Johnny Depp). They develop a relationship which leads to them staying with each other in a hotel. From there, it is presumed by the authorities that Frank is actually Pearce because of his actions with Elise (such as kissing her) and this leads to several games of cat and mouse between Frank and the followers, not stopping until they can finally seize the opportunity to interrogate him and get the money they are owed. Note that there is a bounty on his head too.The film has a slow-medium pace to it, with some of the second half being suitable for insomnia. The chemistry between Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp isn't done very well because of their characters personalities. Elise is a good looking woman who would stay with any man just after a single train ride with him (as we are told in the film) and Angelina Jolie plays this character well. On the other hand, Johnny Depp is known for his many different types of roles in films from playing a pirate to a demonic barber and this time a maths teacher from Wisconsin. Throughout the film he looks puzzled all the time and with this mystery of Alexander Pearce and his little knowledge of it, you can see why. Plus Elise is a dangerous character, suggested by the police watching her, yet Frank is willing to do anything she says. A confused maths teacher, he is. Not such an Edward Scissorhands type of performance this time. The supporting cast includes BAFTA nominee Paul Bettany as Inspector John, the leading agent of the London Scotland Yard squad watching Elise, Timothy Dalton (the man who played Bond in Licence to Kill & The Living Daylights), and Steven Berkoff (Rambo part II, Barry Lyndon). A splendid cast with the main two being internationally known but this is one of the bad choices they have made in their respective careers.The Tourist is similar to the recently released (at the time of writing) The Warrior's Way in terms of how the story is executed. The Warrior's Way did quite well in mixing a western action film with a fantasy. The Tourist does something similar, it combines different genre's – it is a romance film with quite a lot of elements of comedy and at the same time a thriller as you see how the crime story unfolds. The scenes in the film which result from building tension are quite predictable. One major negative point I have to make about this film is the dialogue. Lame lines which attempt to be funny just don't fit in. The script was written poorly with some dreadful lines such as ""That's a terrible name"" which you can see from the trailer if you haven't seen the film yet.Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's efforts of creating a film that is either meant to be similar to romantic comedy like Knight and Day or a romantic thriller like Duplicity fall short of being decent. So I guess two of Hollywood's biggest stars end 2010 in a mediocre movie.On an extra note, the ending of the film has a twist that I will not give away, but I will say that it was disappointing and ultimately made me gave the film 4 stars instead of the 5 it could have received.",The Tourist

The majority of critics writing about this movie are Bay-Bruckheimer juveniles who salivate over explosions and any CG crap that turns toys into gigantic robots.The Tourist has flaws. Name any film that does not. It has chunky exposition scenes - but so did Catch A Thief (directed by the master himself, Hitchcock).But the people moaning about this movie seem totally unaware that it was meant to be an old-fashioned, light-hearted romp.At the same time it acknowledges the present and has slick production values.Some critics are upset about the lack of 'chemistry' between the two leads. Hitchcock was lucky to have the unmarried (at the time) Grace Kelly. Joli has a well-publicized relationship with Brad Pitt and is the mother of how many? Ten kids. Joli and Depp could have faked the passion, but that would have required acting talent. Despite that lack, I say - see it!",The Tourist
207,bmrao1980,Would have been better with Sam and Charlize...maybe,7,26 January 2011,"Well, lets not start on a bad note. I loved the visuals, the cinematography, the pace, the plot, and of course, Venice. Some of the performances like those of Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton were pretty good. The rest of the supporting cast also did well. But, the two leads were a let down.I usually love the films Depp does but in this one, i felt liked he gave a little too controlled of a performance. It felt like he was never sure throughout the movie how his character was going to react to a situation. And the rooftop walk was so much like Pirates of the Caribbean that it felt totally misplaced here.I usually also love Angelina's movies. She is one actress who really knows how to do action scenes, and be the wild girl, very well. She has that feisty look which really helps her in her performances. But here she also was out of her character. She doesn't do the damsel in distress well, even when the character she is playing is acting like one. I guess the director wanted to create an air of suspense by leading us to believe that every time she was in a difficult situation we would get to see her kick-ass her way out of it...and i guess he has failed at that.Another problem with the movie was the make-up department. In some scenes, one couldn't help being distracted by the make-up applied on one or both leads. Angelina looked way too skinny (not a surprise since she is virtually anorexic in Salt) and had too much eye make-up.All in all, this is one movie where there is no question that the two leads were miscast. Makes me wonder how Sam and Charlize would have done, if the trivia are to be believed.",The Tourist
208,riva-910-797068,Wasted Star Power,6,3 January 2011,"I was quite disappointed with The Tourist. I like both Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp but this was not the best vehicle for them. First I thought Angie's talents were wasted. If she is billed as a mysterious woman/possible spy I am anticipating some action. She was just the sex pot in this movie. Her character could have been played by any attractive female actress. I missed the opportunity to see her cunning and strength.I don't know what they were trying to do with Johnny's character, make him less attractive? He is supposed to be just a regular guy but all I kept thinking is why doesn't he have a haircut? Will somebody please shave him? It is a given that he is a beautiful man it was distracting to have him looks so disheveled. The way his character was written does not make me think Johnny Depp. I believe it was miscast. Johnny is a strong dramatic actor as shown in Return to Neverland and of course his comedic and acrobatic/action chops are solid in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Here both actors were wasted.The story was o.k. But the most disappointing thing about this movie was the lack of heat between Angie and Johnny. When her character seems to fall for his it is totally unbelievable. My only thought was why? I expected fireworks on the screen between the two of them and I got nada.The most confusing of all was what type of movie was this? It has been nominated by the golden globes in the comedy category. Reallywhere? Yet the trailers bill it as an action, thriller. Neither category was done well in this case. It was not an exciting action movie or a thriller and definitely not a comedy. The screenwriters seemed to just throw a little bit of this and a little of that into the story to attempt to cover all the bases. Regretfully, it missed the base and I miss the price of admission I paid.www.rivareviews.com",The Tourist

213,narine_tevosyan,Review,10,30 March 2019,"This is one of my favorite movies because it has a breathtaking storyline, which is full of intrigues and secrets. Also, in this movie we see two greatest actors(Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie), which also attracts the viewer's attention.
The movie starts with the following of lady, whose name is Elise. The French police do that because their inspector wants to find her husband Alexandr Pearce, who owes huge money in back taxes and is believed to have received plastic surgery to alter his appearance. However, the intrigue of the movie starts from the moment when we see how Angelina reads a letter from her husband where he instructs her to board the train to Venice, Italy; pick out a man; let the police believe that he is Pearce, because they already know that he has done some plastic surgeries. Elise burns the note, however, the inspector manages to read the remains of this letter with the help of new technologies. So then we see how she chooses Depp, who plays there a mathematics teacher. As the police managed to read this letter, but only about the location, not about the ruse, they start to follow them. After that the intriguing and interesting moments of the movie start. Despite the storyline of the movie, where we as viewers don't understand how everything will continue, we also see a lot of beautiful scenes, because it is filmed in Venice.
And the most important part of this movie is its end, where the police already know that it was all a lie and they hopelessly leave them without any pieces of evidence for catching them and after that Jonny opens the vault and tells her that he is the real Alexandr. I didn't expect it, and it was a surprise for me, and it is all due to the intriguing storyline of the movie, which doesn't allow us to see and understand the end. I really appreciate the work that the screenwriters did for this movie.",The Tourist
214,Nefi,definitely not the disaster you are led to believe it is,7,15 December 2010,"Just over a month ago I finally took the time to see the French film Anthony Zimmer in order to be able to correctly review and evaluate its remake The Tourist when it would be released in cinemas. Now after having seen the remake I am completely astonished at how unnecessarily harsh its reviews are turning at to be.For starters everyone seems to be obsessed with its Golden Globe nomination under the Comedy/Musical genre. Sorry folks, there is no mistake about that. The film is definitely a thriller with heavy comedic tones. Johnny Depp spends the whole film with a perpetual clueless expression on his face that leads the viewer towards comedic feel against which Angelina Jolie's mysterious aura is intentionally contrasted. Those easily judging the actress' performance as robotic and one-note seem to have missed the entire point of her character's function. The story is actually a complete gender reversal of Charade which was also classified as a comedic thriller the last time I checked so anyone not objecting towards that film's classification should also keep their mouth shut when it comes to The Tourist.Antony Zimmer on the other hand is a totally different affair. The French original absolutely has no comedic approach to its dense crime story. It takes place under the bright sun of the French Riviera and has its protagonist on the run from the mob barefoot on the streets of Cannes in heavy sweat. Compare that scene with its leisurely equivalent in the remake this time taking place on the rooftops of a foggy Venice which culminates with a slapstick scene and the differences in both films really stand out. The French film was also shot with many quirky angles and close ups of objects and faces, effectively underlining the main character's helpless situation whereas the remake is bathed in gloriously composed anamorphic vistas of the canals. Also Sophie Marceau's leading lady is presented as a heartless and manipulative opportunist mercilessly making use of an unsuspecting man she spots on a train. The woman in the remake on the other hand has a kinder spirit. The original ultimately comes off as a gritty crime thriller but this remake is a deliberate attempt at recreating the lightweight atmosphere of a 60s era comedy thriller a la Charade or Gambit. There were many times during the film where I felt like I was watching a homage at those films, from the pace of the movements of the actors and the placement of camera to the heavy eye shadow applied to Angelina Jolie's utterly beautiful face, effectively elevating her already mesmerizing physicality to an even higher level appeal of, say, a 60s era Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren or Claudia Cardinale.At the end I must say that the the film is nowhere near the disaster it is presented as being. It is just a finely made and with two international stars, a beautifully and attractively cast adult entertainment. Of course it is no award fodder but don't we need this type of filmmaking every now and then to draw some breath among the flood of family entertainment hurled toward us at every opportunity by the Hollywood money machine? I for one am content with what I saw this evening.",The Tourist
215,kim_smoak,"Sad storyline, fair acting",7,20 December 2010,"I love Johnny Deppeveryone knows this. I went to this movie knowing that it was a flop at the movie theaters and had terrible reviewswhy? Well, I love Johnny Depps movies. What took me so long to see the movieI hate Angelina Jolie. To be honestthe movie didn't make much sense by the end of the movie, and it left me wondering why? This is not the actors fault, it was just VERY poorly written. Depp is funny and charming, while Angelina busts out with one of her worst performances since Tomb Raider. I'm sorry Angelinayour British accent is awful, and you sound like you're whispering your wordsI don't know if it's to be sexybut it was very annoying.Right off the bat, the movie starts with Angelina Jolie, and the whole first half of the movie was about how ""gorgeous"" she iswhich to be honest, in this movie she actually looked old (even older than Johnny Depp). The scenes of intimacyor what was supposed to be the ""spark"" in the movie where you see the two characters fall in loveya, it didn't happen. You're left standing there wondering why Frank (Depp) fell in love with Elise (Jolie) because she was so cold hearted to him. In the endI guess it makes more sensebut for nearly 2 hours of the movie you're wondering why Depp's character doesn't just leavethere was no spark! Overall, not my favorite Johnny Depp moviesadly it's really not because of him, but because of his co-stars and the writers.

216,jazebelle,Watch it if you want to fall asleep,2,1 January 2011,"I watched the first ten minuets of this movie and had no idea where it was heading.What direction it was taking, or where the story started. Considering it was all in a foreign language at the beginning only gave it leeway for the directors to cramp in as much crap as possible to lengthen the time for an intro to further lengthen any extra time which could have possibly salvaged the story line. No one would get the story line until unless they at least read a guide or synopsizes about it. Watch the beginning without hearing what its about, and its got disaster written all over it. Until unless you like sitting down restlessly and waiting for something to sum up from nothing, you might enjoy this flick.The two main stars had zero chemistry, Jolie looked like an older cradle snatcher compared to Depp.Anymore than 40 minuets of the flick, I would have wanted to throw myself off a moving vehicle.

Jolie has a sly smile when reacting to Depp's goofiness, and knows how to deliver her funny lines with a bit of disbelief, which makes them a bit more funny. Most of all, you get the sense Jolie and Depp are doing everything they can to enhance upon a bad script and a bad idea. You can't blame them. They almost save the whole thing but not quite. This was clearly a project not near enough ready to bring to the screen and may have benefited for a lot more work before doing so.

About as exciting as watching an all-day fashion shoot.

Jolie's character was strong and sympathetic. It wasn't too slow, it wasn't too fast, it had action and romance that didn't overpower and humour. Maybe it won't stay with me as long as other movies, but I think my time was well spent watching it.",The Tourist
220,HeirOfDorne,Better than people say.,7,19 September 2013,"To start out I would like to add that the number of bad reviews this got shied me away a bit. However, I figured since it had Johnny Depp in it that it had to be semi decent, and that it was. The story line was solid, but could have been better laid out. It takes a little while into the movie to learn why certain things are happening, but eventually things do play themselves out. I also heard from previous reviewers that the story- line was predictable. I for one didn't see what eventually happened happening. It was a surprise ending, that quite frankly I was fine with. There's not a whole lot of action in the movie, as it focuses largely on the acting of Jollie, and Depp. All in all it is a nice drama, that's worth checking out if you're a fan of either of the actors. It's not an award winner by any stretch of the mind, but it's a nice film for a rainy day. If you can get your hands on it for less than 10$ I'd say go for it and enjoy the ride, and the great scenery.",The Tourist
221,vladtopliceanu,A great romantic thriller,9,26 December 2011,"Good job. Good job to the director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Good job to Graham King, the producer who is best known for movies like The Aviator and The Departed. And not last good job to Christopher McQuarrie(Academy Award winner for The Usual Suspects) and to Julian Fellowes(Academy Award winner for Gosford Park) who wrote the screenplay along with the director. Why am I so pleased? Because I was not expecting anything from this movie, but I almost loved it. All of the people I mentioned did a great job in my opinion. I liked the action, I liked the plot, I liked the characters. And even though this is a romantic thriller I got the feeling of a comedy sometimes, and I really enjoyed that because it worked. I also liked the music, the cinematography and the editing. I know this should not surprise me because every single person who worked on this film is known for her or his success in their line of work. I even kind of liked the way that Depp and Jolie played their roles. The only reason this is not a 10 is that the chemistry between the two main characters...well, it didn't exist. As I mentioned, I liked their performances, but I just can't see the feelings in them.",The Tourist

I must admit, most of the time I just felt the movie was very boring. It seemed to be moving forward very slowly & be pretty predictable. Also I don't know if it attempted to feature real action and thriller components or otherwise appear as really dramatic, but instead I found it quite clumsy, comical, surreal, and kind of forced most of the time. The plot thickened a bit towards the end and made me want to watch it slight more than the first 3/4 or 4/5 of the movie. The final ending was a bit surprising, which saved a bit of what was left to save. You can watch this movie if you really don't know what to watch or have absolutely anything else to watch. Also of course if you're a huge Angelina Jolie and/or Johnny Depp fan, then I guess this is a must watch for you.The settings, stagings, and costumes pleased the eye quite nicely, so esthetically it was very pleasant to watch & even gave me some traveling ideas/inspirations.",The Tourist

No, this film is a fun relaxing movie and although predictable to some extent, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp do an excellent job playing their characters. The one liners are also enjoyable and the whole film is stylish, in a great setting and smooth. Nobody should brainstorm about the plot or this or that little details, that's not the issue in this film. It's just an enjoyable movie experience and I found it even short, ... I wished it would have gone on. After the many flops in the theater in recent months, it was refreshing to finally see something different, to relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Venice. Jolie comes across as the movie star that she is, ... no wonder Depp apparently had a crush on her. And Depp is funny as usual, it seems as if almost a little Jack Sparrow comes across in this flick.

228,bartireid,Romeo and Jolie,7,15 December 2010,"Stop me if you've heard this before in 2010: Hollywood A-list male and Hollywood A-list female thrust together in part funny, part romantic, part action-thriller movie madness. Ring any bells? Well cast your mind back to the summer where Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz teamed up in James Mangold's roller-coaster Knight and Day (2010). The Tourist appears to work along similar lines, most prominently we get another glowing partnership with co-stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp this time taking center stage, which in itself affords The Tourist slightly more potential due to Jolie and Depp's greater talents.Venice is the beautiful and idyllic setting for the story to take place, a labyrinth of Canals symbolic of the divisive narrative awash with twists and turns keeping both audience and subjects off balance. Elise (Jolie) is an elegantly poised English beauty, whose demeanour combines a fierce sophistication with near aristocratic sensibilities. Elise is attempting to rendezvous with a criminal love interest named Alexander Pearce, whilst simultaneously shaking off surveillance from international law enforcement hoping to track down the same person. Elise fatefully becomes acquainted with Frank (Depp) the American tourist a widowed Maths teacher. The plot then takes on a Keyser Soze-esquire dynamic which sees all parties including a sinister Steven Berkoff searching Venice for Pearce yet his identity nobody knows or even can be sure exists at all. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck it would seem has a difficult job to knead the ingredients into something worth watching, he manages to abstain from the wall to wall buffoonery of the aforementioned Knight and Day by focusing more on the aesthetic delights of his stars and scenery, allowing Jolie and Depp room to conjure up an at times engaging on screen chemistry. The viewing experience in the end is fairly satisfying as the tourist does little more than flaunt its good looks in an entertaining fashion that masks successfully its flaws.",The Tourist
229,mmphilip,Depp turns everything he touches into gold!,4,4 August 2011,"Even movies that are less than ordinary! The Tourist is not a fantastic movie, but very entertaining nevertheless, due mainly to Johnny's brilliance and gorgeous chick bones! Angelina Jollie is a beautiful woman, nobody can deny that, even though we girls hate her for this unpardonable sin, but she may have been better served by a catwalk rather than an acting stage.The Tourist follows the story of a woman leading an unsuspecting man to his own death, by luring him to lead the bad guys into believing he is the real deal.Johnny does a fantastic job with what he has, always! He is very funny and very charming in this movie, although maybe a little bit unchallenged, he's much better than this...But it's not altogether bad, the plot is a bit weak, but not terrible, the location (Venice) is always a winner no matter what. Angelina shines in her full glory, adorned in beautiful countless dresses, glossy make-up and the puffiest lips. Johnny is a joy to watch, if I can watch him drunk, stoned and bald for almost 2 hrs in Fear and Loathing, I can watch him in anything...Give The Tourist a chance. If you have noting better to do, it's a good entertainment on a wet cold night, with some nice cheese and a glass of wine to celebrate at least Venice, if you like nothing else.",The Tourist
230,viennashade,"Light entertainment, not high art",7,16 August 2014,"I'm not into either of these stars, though I admit Johnny Depp usually wows me when I do see him, and Angelina Jolie always gives a dependable performance. I figured it would be interesting to see Depp in the role of the hapless patsy. Well, I have always said that actors do their best work playing crazies, and this only confirms my theory. Something like Alice or Sweeney Todd comes so easy for him, but here as an average Joe he was competent though not dazzling. His character was so low-key (almost drab) there was probably only so much he could do with it.Jolie is ever aware of her beauty, seemingly thinking at every moment, ""How can I turn my face or hold my head to make me look absolutely the most exquisite?"" It's a wonder she manages to also act at the same time. (It does, however, seem to have distracted her from her ""British"" accent.) For every second of camera time I think there must have been 5 minutes of makeup and hair-arranging. Yeah, yeah, just jealous, I know, but I'd like to see what she'd be capable of in a plain-Jane role like Mariah Carey in Precious, or with a reverse nose job like Nicole Kidman in The Hours.My favorite scene with the two of them together was on the train when they met, with the little exchange about spy novels. But once Paul Bettany joins the ride (not literally), all my eyes were on him. Bettany is known for upstaging the leads, and here is another great example. In what could have been a rather ho-hum role, he makes his mark and never makes a wrong move. When Depp's character was detained on the boat, it was Paul's expressions I kept rewinding to see again and again, not Johnny's. And Bettany is not shaken being in the same room with Ms. Jolie; he has more important things to think about.Nothing revolutionary but overall a pretty entertaining film. Decent plot, dialogue, top-shelf production, comedy, romantic tension, spectacular sets and scenery, twists, not full of plot holes, and the ending was not unsatisfying, in retrospect. All in all, this was my kind of movie.",The Tourist

Seems as if the director has never even seen a Stanley Donen movie. Not a single moment of fun. Not one! Angelina Jolie behaves like a first time model wearing dresses that were meant for someone else. Atrocious is the word that comes to mind. I haven't been this embarrassed for actor since Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates in the remake of ""Psycho"" Her lines and her delivery are worthy of an amateur, and the script? Goodness, gracious, me! How can this possibly be? Even Venice looks banal. Depp manages a couple of moments but doesn't look well as if we were looking at the movie in the wrong ratio. 15 $ a ticket. I'm so mad! Glimpses of famous (in Italy) Italian actors including Alessio Boni (from The Best Of Youth) add to the depression I felt sitting through this.

Then the genre stated on the internet is wrong and viewers expect something different.I love a beautiful film but somehow Jolie in gorgeous gowns and jewelry looked extremely out of place.Depp is like a lost puppy during the movie and maybe that's the joke but I suspected the twist from the beginning and it still felt flat by too many foreshadowings (again, maybe that's the joke?).Overall, a movie I couldn't really focus on, so if you want a good spy thriller, watch Bond, if you want a good parody, watch The Man from U.

Absolutely not. So why was it reviewed like it was? I thought Johnny and Angelina were perfectly fine and even charming in their roles. I didn't find the film to drag at all and actually thought it was an entertaining and engrossing story that moved along at a good pace. Jolie is the most stunningly beautiful actress of this era and her beauty is even more magnified with the Venice backdrop. Yes if I had it my way, based on my personal tastes, I would have preferred a more serious thriller in the vein of Taken. Because of the tone of the movie I was never really concerned for the welfare of the characters. But it was the film makers' decision to make this lighter fare and it still worked on that level. I thought the subtle comedy in here was actually quite funny and sarcastic in a way and so did the other people in the audience. I know a lot of people complained about the predictable twist at the end but I can't comment on that as a couple of the reviews I read prior to seeing this pretty much gave that away. I will say though that I was more surprised with the twist concerning Elise, Jolie's character. My only real complaint is the score, I thought it got in the way at times and was a little too ""sappy fairy tale"" if you can understand that. Overall I think this was a fun, harmless throwback crime caper and really, a bit of a modern spoof on the genre. I loved the cheeky line at the end-- was that a wink at Depp's less than perfect looks in this movie? B+",The Tourist

And whilst this is not a masterpiece, I've seen far worse films that have garnered better reviews.Sometimes I think critics review on expectation rather than on what they see on the screen. Depp, Jolie, von Donnersmarck and stunning locations - surely it will be fantastic! Well it was simply OK.I must admit as I watched this film, I kept thinking of ""Charade"" with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn. Itself not a masterpiece, but an illustration of how good Grant was in this type of film. He could play charming and witty, but there was often something in the background with Grant that made you think that there was much more going on.Unfortunately, Depp, either poor direction or poor choices comes off as unsure on how to play his part. We know there's a mystery, we know there's a twist coming, but instead of helping us enjoy the journey, Depp's Frank seems too neutral a character to help give us any reason to become involved in the story.",The Tourist

To me, Angelina could have been replaced with a manikin without much loss in talent. And while I normally enjoy Johnny Depp's characters, this wasn't much of a stretch for him. My guess is that both he and Angelina wanted to go to Venice and that's why they did the movie. There isn't much in it, Johnny and Angelina have no chemistry and you really don't care.

I was perfectly fine with that -- I wasn't expecting the movie to be ""Summertime as a spy movie"" and I was fine with Jolie's character Elise keeping Johnny Depp's Frank Tupelo at arm's length and finding him to be amusing. There were points during the movie that you see that -- in how Tupelo is shocked that Elise would leave him and let he would find her again.What bugs me about the movie is the shift in tone it takes -- the movie can't decide if it's a light-hearted comedy or a Bond/Bourne spy thriller. Almost abruptly and about half way through the movie, Elise reveals that she's a spy and is going to turn Pierce in. The last 30 minutes is fine although a bit annoying by the final reveal. I somewhat wished that you still didn't know who Pierce was by the end -- that would make up for it and would make you wonder who Pierce really was (part of me wished it was Paul Bettany's character or Timothy Dalton's). I also wished that the movie didn't spend most of its time trying to be a romance and stuck with an ""innocent man caught in a spy network"" story that too was attempted.So if you see this movie, it's not bad. Venice is beautifully shot and makes up for the sometimes awful story. Some of the jokes and sight gags are truly funny. But the movie isn't that great either.",The Tourist

She drags him into a world-wind of an adventure and in the mist of it all, finds himself falling for her. With every gun-shot aiming for him and the faster they run, the faster their romance increases.Director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmark portrays romance as a dangerous game, just like the situation that the characters fall themselves into. Even though the storyline was a bit confusing and the ending was predictable, Donnersmark was very clever on how she would keep the storyline going, with the comedy.The unlikely duo, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, plays Elise and Frank, two people who fall in love during a dangerous chase that Elise gets herself into and unfortunately Frank too. Angelina shows a little bit of her 'Lara Croft' character in Elise because they both are strong willed and determined. They both are determined that they are right... nothing surprising there, right? It would've been better to see Jolie play a different character from her previous ones. Johnny Depp, on the other hand shows another side of him we have never seen before. We've seen him as the eccentric Willy Wonka, the brave Captain Jack Sparrow and the much loved Edward Scissorhands. In my opinion, I see all three characters in Frank, minus Willy Wonka.

But we agreed there was nothing wrong with checking The Tourist out, at worst there would be some eye candy.Once again, I'm glad I blew the critics off - it's not that the negative reviews are wrong, exactly. There ARE too many scenes of entire rooms of people turning around to look at Jolie, like a perfume commercial (or someone with toilet paper stuck to their behind). Characters and relationships aren't fleshed out enough, and it's a predictable film - North by Northwest is far superior.But. As one critic said, it's a frothy diversion, pleasant and fun. Thought the rumpled Depp was low-key and charming, and Jolie was gorgeous and a sympathetic character. There are some amusing twists, and our fairly full theater laughed a lot and was entertained by the film; at no point did any of us lose interest.

Me and my boyfriend only went to go to see this film because the one we wanted to see wasn't showing at the time, but we're both glad we dd see it. First off, the chemistry between Depp and Jolie was just amazing, it was lighthearted and flirtatious, the way it's supposed to be when you meet a good-looking stranger in a foreign country. Secondly, Jolie looked amazing on the big screen, as always, but it was nice to see her doing a more 'girly' role for one, but her performance didn't differ from any other film she's been in, she still lit up a room and carried herself off as an independent and strong woman. Thirdly, Depp, as always was just comical, he really added the fun value to this film, but still got serious when the time was right. Overall, the film had a bit of everything, romance, comedy and mystery and really made for a good watch. It's not chick-flick fluff, but it's not manly action, it's an in-betweener, with some great actors and fabulous scenery too.",The Tourist
258,scarlatov,"Lack of original story, just a good remake of the french movie ""Anthony Zimmer""",5,21 February 2011,"When I went to see ""The Tourist"" my expectations were really high, because I am a big fan of Johnny Depp and i believe his acting talent is admirable by any means. This combined with Angelina's feminine, posh and sexy contribution in most movies she participates in, was a reason enough to watch the movie. Unfortunately beside acting, nice locations and cinematography, for a good movie you need something very important - an Original Story!In this case there was no such thing, simply because ""The Tourist"" is a remake of the 2005 french movie ""Anthony Zimmer"" staring Sophie Marceau and Yvaan Attal...""The Tourist"" is an absolute replica of the french version and the only difference i could find is the venue (Venice in the remake and Nice in the original), as well as the faith of the local detective.I believe that the American public will love the movie because most probably a french movie did not have much chance among the English speaking audience in the past, so very few people are probably familiar with the script outside Europe.In brief i could say that the acting and cinematography were great, people that do not know the story will like it, though it is pretty predictable even if you haven't watched the original french movie.",The Tourist
259,benettfreeman,The worst movie I've seen in a long time,1,19 August 2016,"For a movie that is completely based around its so-called 'twist', this movie ought to have tried harder to stop people guessing the twist. I think I guessed it almost as soon as the movie started. There is a heavyweight cast going through the motions in possible the most formulaic script ever, but the whole time it was completely obvious where it was going, which made suspending my disbelief impossible.Looks like the Devil claimed Johnny Depp's talent from him during the filming of The Ninth Gate. He hasn't done anything good since.As for Jolie, she shows no emotion during the whole film, and could easily be swapped out for any of the 150 go-to 'good looking' actresses. Farcical.",The Tourist

I don't understand all the negative reviews. The movie had good action, a good plot, bad guys, great actors, lots of glamour, suspense, and a beautiful location (Venice!). The chemistry between Frank (Depp) and Elise (Jolie) was subdued but it was strong. The ending was a pleasant surprise. If you're looking for a romantic comedy, this isn't the movie for you. Yes, it had a few laugh out loud scenes, but I don't think the movie was intended to be a comedy. It's more a light drama - and a very enjoyable one at that.",The Tourist
261,KevinMariblanca,It was JUST okay,6,27 March 2012,I watched this movie just recently. The acting was fairly good. I mean with the likes of Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in one movie you would think it would be exceptional. But for the first half of the movie I was already bored. I was very confused as to whether this would turn out to be a full-blown action movie or a romantic film. I think the main problem of the movie was its complacency to the execution of both main actors. The story could have been better but it really fell short. One scene was very disturbing for me:Why did Angelina Jolie seem like she was a damsel-in-distress? I mean if she was an Interpol agent she should've at least shown some skills in defensive maneuvers but in the time where she was dragging Depp's boat she even squealed. It was annoying and weird.Overall I found this movie a failure.,The Tourist

Angeline Jolie is her usual beautiful self - self assured and mysterious. She plays a woman who has a dark past which is slowly revealed as we follow her from Paris to Venice. Johnny Depp is the poor fly caught in her web if mystery and intrigue. So many twists and turns, its like a maze - just when you think you have found the end - you are off on another tangent! Beautiful scenery, and I am not talking about Angeline and Depp! Venice as you have never seen it before.

At some point I was confused as to who was who but at the end everything made sense. It was also a fun movie that had a little bit of action in it. Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors because no matter what role he gets he always acts good. In this movie I really liked his character and how he was combined with Angelina Jolie, which I thought was really good combination. I also liked that it was made in Italy which is one of the few places I hope to travel to one day.

266,GaelicLass,"No ""To Catch a Thief"" Here!!",4,17 December 2010,"I have never rated any movie below a 5 on this site, but there is always a first time. I never thought it would be a movie starring one of the greatest actors of our time, and one of the most beautiful actresses around. It also starred some of my other favorites like Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, and Timothy Dalton. Sadly, we don't see enough of Sewell and Dalton.We decided to see this movie even though the critics gave it very poor reviews, trusting instead the 81% favorable user ratings on another site. I never thought in my wildest dreams that a movie with the credentials of this one might be bad....but, it was. Boring, in fact. Those 81% must be Angelina fans happy to be seeing her in anything or Depp lovers, even.By now you probably know the storyline about a beautiful, mysterious woman, (Jolie), who becomes involved with some mysterious goings on starting in Paris and moving on to Venice. She meets a man (Depp) on a train (an old plot ploy) and takes him to her hotel in Venice where she kisses him and then promptly leaves him to sleep on the couch. Then the real action starts..a gangster is after a man he think is some one who stole from him, instead finding a mild mannered math teacher, simply a tourist. The scenery in Venice is gorgeous and helps make up for some plot holes. The story is so muddled that the scenery doesn't help enough.Hmmmm....at this point I thought, OK, between the scenery of Venice and Jolie's beautiful dress in the opening scenes, this movie is trying to revive the international caper with gorgeous clothes, romance, and witty dialog genre that ""To Catch a Thief"" did so well in the 1950's, or even ""Charade"". If that is what it was trying to be, it missed it's mark! Depp can't hold a candle to Cary Grant's performances (in both movies) and Jolie is no Grace Kelly, even though she tries very hard to be the next ice queen...and never to Audrey Hepburn, a one of a kind actress who will never be matched, in style or wit.Nothing about this film worked well. The cinematography was just OK, the writing was terrible, and the direction was missing. In one scene what was supposed to be a long, slow romantic approach to each other was interrupted by a song that was far from romantic. In another, Depp's attempts at humor fall flat. The few times Jolie spoke, I wasn't sure what kind of accent she was trying to do, only figuring out through other sources what nationality she was supposed to be. Think what you will of Angelina, but I don't see her as a serious actress. She is just beautiful, and extremely frail looking in this role, not sexy at all. I love Depp but he has rarely gone for the romantic leading man role. He should stick to what he does so well, the quirky, character driven roles.I read somewhere that this was supposed to be a comedy. Maybe in Neverland! What was the Foreign Press thinking when they were giving nominations to this movie in the field of musical and/or comedy? And, for what...? They missed their mark, too!",The Tourist
267,abujug2,decent watchable film but predictable,10,9 December 2010,"The movie is definitely not as bad as others are saying. Johnny Depp fans won't be disappointed...in the trailer it might look like Depp is playing second fiddle to Jolie but that's not true cause Depp's role is of primary importance here. And Depp with his antics(electric cigarette etc) was very charming..even his one liners are awesome..his goofy style of comic timing lifts the proceedings of this film. The things that work in this film are Johnny,Jolie,their chemistry and interactions,locations The main drawback of this movie is the predictable plot and climax twist which is nothing new for Hollywood. Not a must watch film but definitely one-time watchable.

268,julielange-may,Miscast Romp with no fizz,2,21 January 2020,"I had trouble continuing to watch this film after the first scene where Angelina emerges in a weirdly formal frumpy dress with way too much makeup and bizaarely shelacked hair reminiscent of an aging country star about to receive a lifetime achievement award. She's getting coffee in a paris cafe... She's supposed to be ""cool."". She continues to appallingly over dress through the entire film and walks around like a stiff posthumous version of Mae West minus the sass since apparently we are to interpret this as ""femme-fatale."". Thats why so many people ""stare"" at her ""fataleness"" I suppose. The fake U.K. accent doesn't help either.
Johnny Depp is completely inocuous as the hapless tourist but perhaps this was his prime directive. I think we do need some evidence of personality though for either of these characters in order to care about what happens.
I gave 3 stars to this film for the scenery and the few funny moments of Johnny attempting Spanish in lieu of Italian. In truth this film needed different casting, definitely different styling, and a more action packed script to be successful.",The Tourist
269,3rd-row,Romantic caper movie,7,15 December 2010,"Lovely little movie. Good fare for a date night. A quiet mosey of adventure where a woman under police surveillance is told to catch a train to Venice and strike up a friendship with a random stranger on the train--a math teacher on vacation is the winner: dinner on the train, a parting of ways, a chance meeting and shared taxi ride. She is orchestrating, he is along for the ride. In Venice, mobsters in search of their stolen money join the hunt. It reminded me a bit of Charade with the roles of Hepburn and Grant reversed: Jolie as the one in control and Depp as the person in over their head, but trying to keep up.

I honestly ask how the actors could of signed on for such a travesty. Seriously how did such screenwriters (gosford park) etc. go so horribly wrong. Angelina Jolie changes dresses in mid-action on the boat, if that not tells you how poorly written and directed nothing else will. I am giving it a 3 and that is being generous.

Depp in role of a math professor seemed contained, I can't understand why not let him play more mischievous and playful character that he is excellent at playing.

As a result, you sit kind of empty-headed as to where the plot should go in order to get you from point A to point B. You fill in the gaps as best you can, but you only have the slimmest idea of what to do.In the case of ""The Tourist"" it shows. This movie goes absolutely nowhere during the middle of the film. As soon as the yucky song appears while Ms. Jolie is driving her boat, this film takes a major nosedive. The ""are they or aren't they"" idea is stretched very thin. Johnny Depp valiantly tries to deal with the material he has been given, but it's also apparent he doesn't know how to handle some of it either.

277,howard_Patrick,Poor directing is the movie's flunk,3,3 January 2011,"A lot of movie goers like great match-ups in movies, like Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw in ""Jaws"", Harrison Ford and Sean Connery in ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusades"" and Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton in ""Twister"". All o f these match-ups were put together because both actors are known to be in films that are action adventure, romance, dramatic or comedic. People want to see how work together while they throw their best acting cards on the table. The other reason they are put in the film is that each actor brings a different atmosphere to the film and the film maker hopes and believes that old saying, ""opposites attract"" and will lead to a great movie. The new release, ""The Tourist"" has a pairing that fans have been psyched about, since word of this movie leaked from Hollywood, the much anticipated combination of Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. Even though this is a great match-up, the ball was dropped by German director, Florian Henkel Van Donnersmark, with his flat and uninteresting dialogue that forced these actors to try and work what little tools they were given. The plot is about a beautiful mysterious woman named, Elise Clifton-Ward, who randomly sits next to an American math teacher named, Frank Tupelo (Depp). They are on a train heading to Venice, Italy and after a pretty mystic and sensual meeting, Elise convinces Frank to come to her Venice suite. After a sexual tease and intense night, Frank finds out that Elise picked him to distract Scotland Yard inspector, John Acheson (Paul Bettany), and a furious mobster from catching her lover. Alexander Pierce, who embezzled over two million American dollars from an English mob boss, Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff). As pages unfold, Frank realizes that everyone is after him because he is mistaken for Pierce, which then leads to a cat and mouse game through Venice. To start the film's flaws, the direction in every aspect ""The Tourist"" has to offer its action, mystery, thrills and visuals. Surprisingly there is hardly any action in the film, we probably have the trailer (which was misleading) to thank for that. Along with this criticism, the action wasn't that great and didn't really wow me all that much. An example of this apathetic action is the boat chase and fight that is performed by Elise, Frank and one of the Shaw's Russian goons. The boats are going down the Venice water ways at what looks like only 10 mph. The funny thing about it is while the chase is going on the remaining Russian's are scouring through the allies as quick as they can. I'm thinking to myself, you guys can speed walk and would probably be ahead of the boats. The mystery of Alexander Pierce that circulates through the movie isn't really developed that well. Whenever the character mentions something about Pierce it's always about his connection with Elise and how he stole two million dollars. To keep the audience intrigued with Pierce, Donnersmark should have given more back-story to him. The thrill of a chase in a film should have you on the edge of your seat and surprise you with some close calls. Here, on the other hand, it's a different story. I say the action isn't very good because he stunts that are done in the movie have been done in other movies and done better. There is a roof chase where Frank is running away from Russian agents on the roof tops of hotels. Much like the boat chase it seemed to be happening at a very slow pace. At the end of the scene Frank comes to the edge of the hotel roof and is stuck between the agents and then drops down to a market scene full of pedestrians. I have seen this ending before, he character must choose between being captured or a deadly drop, the drop is usually the choice. In this chase it takes Frank five minutes to jump off the edge of the roof even though you know he will survive. Lastly, the direction that Donnersmark took with the visuals of Venice was a generic and familiar path. I was hoping before the movie started that the director would shoot new shots of Venice that haven't typically been seen before. Once again, I was deeply disappointed with the shots was just of city water ways and Venice citizens eating at outside café's. Putting all of these criticisms together has the making for a pretty bad movie. The terrible direction is the films main loss of points and the dialog Bethany that makes each character uninteresting which leads to your basic ""yes"" or ""no"" answers. The only upside is that fanatic Johnny Depp fans will scream their heads off by just seeing his face and the guys (myself included) will be happy to see the sexiest current day actress, Angelina Jolie. ""The Tourist"" gets a two out of four popcorn bags.",The Tourist

For starts both the main actors Johnny and Angelina were very good and there acting was supper. The chemistry between them really made it feel more real. The action was really good and I really enjoyed watch the police or CIA agent running around. It was a different idea to most films I have seen and the twists in the movie made it more and more interesting as the film moved on. I have to say watching Johnny play a more different character to what he normally played gave me more reasons to buy it on DVD.

The best performance by far is Steven Berkoff, but all are defeated by the red flag waving script... or maybe it's unsubtle direction signaling every contrived twist and turn before it happens.

If you're like me and go into a film aware of such amounts of negativity you tend to view the film in, yes, a negative light and look for the things that are pointed out by the so called professional 'critics' which you otherwise may not have noticed otherwise. But I will not try to ruin what could be a perfectly fun viewing experience, you like it, you like it, you don't, you don't.Starring the wildly diverse Johnny Depp and the enigmatic Angelina Jolie, 'The Tourist' brings together two of Hollywood's biggest stars for what could be referred to as a quick film in between projects, that's if you believe IMDb Trivia.Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck 'The Tourist' tells the story of Elise Clifton-Ward (Jolie), a lovestruck English woman who follows the instructions of her illustrious lover who we know as 'Alexander Pearce'. The man pursued by Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany who delivers a splendid reference to 'A Knights Tale'), a driving force behind the operation to catch Pearce. It is when she is 'summoned' by the mysterious Pearce to fool the authorities into believing she is with him already that poor American, Frank (Depp) is pulled into a world of chase, gangsters, police and Italians with attitude against the beautiful backdrop of Venice, Italy.The film is what it is, and it knows what it is. Although it didn't sweep the Oscars (just a couple of Golden Globe nominations, Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress) it is an enjoyable movie experience and any fans of Depp or Angelina will surely get a kick out of it, especially at the end!

I was scared it wouldn't have any of the magic of his other notable films. Fans need not worry, however. This movie is an excellent add on to his collection of roles.

284,ffattahi,"Very good movie. Naysayers are unfair and, with all due respect, clueless.",7,16 March 2011,"I am writing this review after reading a lot of negative reactions on the IMDb forum from people who frankly missed the point. A very unfortunate product of our times of technology, the internet, and other conveniences is today's impatient audience who demands immediate satisfaction and movies that are over the top CGI filled action from the very first minute to the last climactic explosion. When a movie attempts to build up something it is accused of being slow and boring. Alfred Hitchcock would have been a Hollywood failure today because the first hour of most of his movies were slow, meticulous, and borderline boring while setting us up for the second hour of intrigue.For those of you who missed the point, this picture is an homage to the type of lighthearted but very entertaining romantic comedy/adventure/intrigue movies of the 60s that directors like Stanley Donen and Blake Edwards expertly put out. Those pictures almost always had Paris, Venice, and other European scenery as backdrop and the cute mismatched - only to be matched later - couple as protagonist. We were taken on a ride around Europe with the bad guys chasing the good guys while we were never sure until the end whether all of the good guys were really good. The audience patiently sat in their seats and were rewarded with a good feeling coming out of the theater. What's so wrong with that?When IMDb forum posters disappointingly ask if this was a comedy, my answer is go watch ""Charade"" and tell me if it was one!When they think the twist did not make sense I just ask, ""What if she chose Depp on the train by an unfortunate accident that Pierce hadn't counted on?"" When you think about it, the characters would have had a much smoother and less eventful life if it all had gone the way Pierce had planned.And finally when they call the ending silly or implausible, I just have one word to say: ""Chill!""..... OK, more words: ""This is supposed to be a somewhat silly, romantic adventure, not Hamlet."" As such, I think it delivered. I came out of the theater totally entertained, and if you are too young to have watched great predecessors of this genre, I highly recommend watching ""Charade."" I guarantee you will enjoy it and gain a better appreciation of ""The Tourist.""",The Tourist
285,bleu30,When it ends it feels like nothing happened,5,17 May 2014,"I think I chose the appropriate title for this review.I think 6/10 rating that it currently has is about right, but I gave it 5/10 because for me it's more of a 5.5 (but closer to 5).Let's start with the positive. The movie does have an interesting twist. Okay, I found it somewhat predictable but I think others might not. Other than that, it's filmed in Venice and has Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in it.Now the negative. I found the action to be unrealistic in that there was at least one scene where I thought there is no way that person would not be shot. Also, I found the action not to be particularly creative or interesting either. As far slow starts, I think this has one of the slowest starts I have ever seen. But the bigger problem is that even with all the action and chases, it still somehow feels, at least to me, slow throughout the entire movie. Another issue for beginning of the movie is that it is not completely clear what is going on and it remains so longer than the usual movie.Don't let the 5/10 or 6/10 rating keep you from watching The Tourist. These days few movies are worthy of getting a 9/10 or 10/10.",The Tourist
286,mush_disaster,Worst female character ever?,4,22 February 2018,"Honestly, the only positive thing I could see in this movie, apart from the beautiful scenery, was Johnny Depp's somewhat endearing character. The plot was boring and unconvincing. Angelina Jolie's character I imagine is supposed to appear quirky yet classy and alluring but I found her to be is dull, emotionless and annoying. There was no chemistry between Depp and Jolie and for the whole span of the film I could not fathom what made her such an attractive person in all the male characters' eyes. In fact, I think the main problem with the movie was Angelina's character. Without it ""The tourist"" would have been another mediocre try at a mystery-romance-action movie - boring but tolerable. But the lead female character was in, my eyes, so incredibly vexing that her mere presence in a scene made me want to skip forward. All in all, The Tourist was a major disappointment. I do not recommend it unless you're a hardcore fan of any of the actors as I suspect only fans can find any enjoyment watching this movie.",The Tourist

However there is nothing new with Johnny Depp. The characters he portrays in different movies have a strong similarity, proposing that he brings his own personality to them. Although this could be argued as a positive, it simply highlights Johnny Depp's lack of ability to resonate with different characters and personalities on screen.One of the highlights of The Tourist is the music. The various soundtracks by James Newton Howard fit in perfectly with the different scenes of the movie, be it comedy, romance or action.The storyline is, at times confusing and hard to understand.

The film doesn't disappoint in terms of showing the beauty of Venice. Having said that, the film disappoints in nearly every other way. I wanted to like the movie. But we've seen it all before, and it's been done better in a lot of other movies. Depp and Jolie have little to no chemistry, and most of the time he looks at her as though he knows he's way out of her league. It may be the character he plays, but it's boring. Jolie is just a beautiful model in this film--gorgeous clothing, nice hair and makeup, but her beauty can't help the film's lack of real plot and story. She too looks bored. Give me a James Bond film any day over this--for fun, intrigue, romance, action and plot. As fantastical as the James Bond films are, they shine compared to The Tourist.",The Tourist

Angelina is just waking around with her head held up high (the only pretty view in the entire picture), while Johnny is plain, with no interesting or entertaining features. If they were to make him goofy, Pirates of the Caribbean style (which i guess they tried to avoid), at least he would have a chance to save this movie.

The movie was missing a lot of important plot moments, and with those missing, it seemed as if some of the parts was missing half the story in order for a proper build up. There is no real humor, only one part if my memory serves me right, and come on, in movies which are made like this, we need some good jokes to keep us watching.I recommend you do not watch this one, and rent ""Anthony Zimmer"" instead, because that movie was great.I rate this ***",The Tourist

I felt thoroughly captivated as soon as I started watching, as if a magic wand had me glued to the screen. Jolie's presence was mesmerizing, projecting an uncanny combination of beauty, delicacy, fragility, elegance and femininity, in a way rarely seen on the big screen (or small for that matter). Combined with Depp's purity of presence and genuineness, there were some magical moments forming between the two that constitute true cinematic gems. Great attention was given to the little things which in turn allows the viewer to experience a greater level of participation As far as I am concerned, the genius of the director is felt every step of the way, and if you prefer a genuine mysterious interaction between people (and some riveting drama/action scenes) over a parade of special effects, then you are in for a wonderful treat.",The Tourist
293,mrheathcliff,"Not bad, but not that good either",6,11 February 2011,"Let me begin this review on a good note, I don't like Angelina Jolie. She is pretty and talented I must say, but she doesn't quite reach the standard that the media shoves down all of our throats and certainly not her own. She has way too many cameras forcefully and yes willingly shoved up her skinny backside to be considered a true humanitarian in this world. I don't care how many children from third world countries she adopts or if she's married to Brad Pitt. I am not her biggest fan. So it almost goes without saying that I really wasn't that interested in viewing The Tourist. If I wasn't such a Johnny Depp fan I wouldn't have taken my wife to see it.So let me attempt to put my biases aside for a moment to give a synopsis of the film..The Tourist is somewhat of a caper movie. Jolie plays Elise, an elegant and mysterious character that is being watched by international authorities while they seek to apprehend her former lover and thief extraordinaire, Alexander Peirce. From the beginning of the film, Peirce via mail carrier sends Elise notes advising her on what steps she can take for them to be reunited. The first step requires her to find a tourist who can serve as a reliable dupe for Pierce as the investigators don't know what he looks like. The dupe will either be arrested on suspicion of being Peirce. Oh by the way, the international police aren't the only ones looking for him. The thug nasty mobsters he stole from want their money and his head. Shenanigans deluxe ensue!Strengths: Johnny Depp of course! His character is charming, funny, and unsuspecting. The perfect dupe. The movie has some good action scenes and is entertaining most of the time. It also has a surprise ending that really saves the movie from being a ""dud"" overall. It would also make a great date movie.Weaknesses: Now it is time to bring my biases back. Angelina Jolie is the biggest problem in this movie. She is stiff and smug the entire film. She spends most of the movie swaying her hips with every step, showing viewers how much she likes herself. She probably should have concentrated on acting the way she is capable of. Her character is unlikable and she has no chemistry with Depp on screen. Another problem with the film, as alluded to above, is the pacing. It is really slow to get the ball rolling. The trailers for the movie would have you believe that there is non-stop action. In reality, the plot develops very slowly and half the film is over before you see much action. The police are incredibly stupid too. They spend the entire time running in circles while the criminals they are chasing make them look like idiots.Recommendation: This film is hardly a must-see. If you are a big Johnny Depp it is. If you are a big fan of Angelina Jolie you probably don't care that she sucks big time in this movie. The language isn't bad by Hollywood standards. There is no nudity. The action is of the non- bloody variety. It is pretty safe for most viewers with the exception of small children and they would probably be more interested in watching something more fun like Despicable Me (currently available to rent) or Megamind (soon to be available to rent). And as mentioned above guys, a good opportunity to take the wife or girlfriend to.",The Tourist
294,josecarlosamador,Not for Tomb Raider fans...,8,27 February 2012,"I don't know why so many bad reviews. It's hard to describe a movie like this... I'll try not to spoil it for you. Lets start with the characters: Do you remember those action movies where Angelina Jolie just goes out kicking and shooting everyone? It's not that sort of movie. Her character (Elise) is much more mature, and real than the ones in other movies. She is a shown as an intelligent, good-looking woman who hides a lot of secrets, softly disguising her doubts and fears, which only emerge in the final scenes. While she may not play this role as good as a certain Meryl Streep would, she sure did a great job at it. The only problem with Elise was the continuous sex appeal surrounding her for the entire movie (cameras focusing her body shapes, men staring as she walked by, etc.) and even the non-stopping mysterious acting, even in certain awkward situations, giving a tiring clichê aspect during the entire film.Johny Depp starts as a shy, clumsy teacher (Frank) who is stunned by Elise's beauty, charm and confidence. His traditional funny mannerisms that you see in movies like the Pirates of the Caribbean are in this movie used by the character to hide his awkward and shy behavior, as a graceless man that puts too much effort in looking like a hero. I believe this feature was, in some points, overreacted making Frank a childish and immature person most of time.In a short version: both play more serious characters then their usual, however, it lacked a bit more balance in certain situations for both. Still, both acted very good!About the script: intelligent, simple, mysterious. Certainly not an usual plot.Production: no big mistakes. There was a great concern regarding the visuals of the film. While the scenes were simple, without too much ""fancyness"", the details were carefully supervised.It's a more serious movie for both characters, while keeping the sensuality of Angelina Jolie, and the humor of Johny Depp. So, for me, this gets an 8/10.",The Tourist

To brush up my memory about stardom and directorship, seeing this gives myself a very good excuse to check out again 'Don't Look Now' by Nicolas Roeg, shot also at Venice and 'Thomas Crown Affair' by John McTiernan or Norman Jewison, shot at not as beautiful NYC with cops not as foolish and plots a little less predictable, if DVD are accessible.",The Tourist

It appears the only reason this movie was made was to give an anorexic Jolie a.k.a Cruella de Ville and an unflattering Johnny Depp some air time. A predictable plot, stereotypical roles which appear to be borrowed from Pink Panther.

I watched it in the TV, so I did not pay any extra.To me it was at least more interesting than the Santa film. Sure it has improbable plot parts, and not much Oscar quality acting. I still found it interesting enough to watch all of it, and I did not really figure out the twist before it happened. So I liked it but not enough to use words ""superb"" and ""flawless"" like one reviewer. Someone also asked who would not love Johnny Depp. I like him but I do not ""love"" him. For some reason when I first saw him in the train, it took some time before I was sure it was him. That must have had something to do with lack-lustre acting.

There is almost no chemistry on screen between Depp and Jolie. To my opinion, Jolie can only play one role and that's a hot mysterious woman who thinks modeling agencies are taking her picture in almost every scene of the movie.This woman can not act! This movie is like a fashion show for Jolie, overdressed in practically every scene and really, really exaggerates her acting as a mysterious woman with more than meets the eye. Depp disappointed me as well in this one, though he's actually nothing to blame because Jolie was the center of attention in practically every scene. The story is weak and dumb, the more attentive viewer may discover the 'big twist' quite early in the movie after which you just have to wait for the rest of them to find out. Nothing wrong with the setting though, Venice is stunning but they could have done so much more with it!A very, very big opportunity missed hopelessly.

304,costycyp,Good or bad? this is the question,7,26 December 2010,"""The Tourist"" is a European romantic-comedy-action-espionage film starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. Taking a simple story the director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, focuses on too many genres. He adds in a plot twist that the average movie watcher will figure out within the first 15 minutes of the film. Being a huge Johnny Depp fan, I admit I was nervous about this movie. It looks like a big blockbuster and he's playing a character that he's never tried before: the leading man. I was scared it wouldn't have any of the magic of his other notable films. Fans need not worry, however. This movie is an excellent add on to his collection of roles. If you disagree while watching, wait for the surprise ending; that will help you to see what he saw in this character. Should you see this movie? No. The story refused to challenge the viewer. The acting was fine, unfortunately there was little on-screen chemistry between Jolie and Depp. You might want to see it if you have never been to Italy and want to see some beautiful shots of the canals and the architecture.

It is, wholeheartedly, a comedy. Anyone who missed that must have been watching a different film, because it's funny - in fact, it's hysterical. But not because it's ""so bad it's good"". No, it's totally intentional. The lines are funny, the pauses are funny, the actors are funny... it's like a younger, slightly subtler, Venetian version of Red. What's not to like? We're all used to seeing Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in dramatic roles - Finding Neverland, Public Enemies, The Changeling, A Mighty Heart... and it's so easy to forget that they can be funny. But they are, both of them. Johnny shines, as he always does. Angelina Jolie looks glorious, and when she smiles, the screen lights up. They don't have chemistry, critics say. Oh yes, they do, I say. More importantly, they seem to be enjoying themselves.Johnny's Frank is delightful, touching and slightly mysterious. He has endless room to play around, and makes Frank memorable, and lovely, as only Johnny can. Angelina's role is more limiting, but she still makes it fresh and - yes - deeply amusing, parodying both herself and the genre in general. Watching her saunter around on her high heels, one can't help but recall what James Bond used to be like. This isn't Wanted or Salt: she has far more to do here than look cryptic and shoot people, and she does it very well.Add to that the utterly magnificent Paul Bettany, Timothy Dalton, a few stereotypically dim Russian gangsters (they speak actual Russian, for once, and their funniest lines aren't subtitled) and Rufus Sewell, and there's no way you can go wrong.Yes, there's a twist at the end - a twist that seemed to annoy most people. But does that take away from the film? No! It adds to it, because it's just so obvious, and natural, that it's all the funnier for it. This isn't an intellectual film. Nor does it try to be. It's a romp, a fun romp with two beautiful, endlessly talented actors, set in a beautiful city (which is shot so beautifully that it becomes like a separate character).

Angelina Jolie must have had it in her contract that every actor is supposed to stare at her as she passes. She constantly poses like she's in a photo shoot and waits for the cast to look longingly at her. Acting? Who can tell, Jolie was a statue. Her makeup was so heavy, I kept thinking about it. Not a good sign. When the movie is so slow and the makeup so heavy that you are wondering what kind of spatula they used to slather it on, it's not good. At one point, she is walking with so much exaggeration in her hips you wonder if she's joking. She's not. Nothing is funny or clever in this movie.Depp strangely does no better. Maybe he was annoyed with her too. Depp doesn't look like he wants to be there at all. The story? Barely there. It must have been written on a napkin over coffee; not even dinner.

I'm a big fan of Jolie and will watch any movie she's in. Not only is she a wonderful actor but also absolutely gorgeous to boot. To misquote Dr. K, my favourite reviewer, I could watch her reading the phone book dressed in overalls and not be bored.But - dear oh dear, what a shame to waste her talents on this - I just hope that she puts what she has earned to good use. The plot is rather lame and if you can't spot the likely outcome after the first 15 minutes, then you have probably left your brains at the ticket booth. The scenery is stunning. Ms. Jolie is always perfectly beautiful but her costumes seem a little overwhelming. The lack of chemistry between her and a haggard looking Depp is rather unfortunate and a result of poor casting.

311,postette,The Eyes Have It,3,2 January 2011,"There are two stars of this film, and it is neither of the leads; instead, they end up being the city of Venice and the makeup artist who did Angelina Jolie's eyes. The only people who will enjoy this film are the few who enjoyed Knight and Day, those that want to see Venice but can't afford to go there, and those who never get tired at looking at Angelina Jolie's face.This film is a visual treat for the viewer, but little else. I can't think of a film that has allowed me to see this much of Venice before and I am thankful for that extended glimpse at such a beautiful and unique city. As to Angelina Jolie's eyes, they are almost characters unto themselves, stealing the scene even more than her puffy lips (looking unusually dry and cracked). Yes, the makeup artist that did her eyes made her eyes very beautiful and Jolie used them to full effect here, glancing down and half-closing her eyes as many times as she could so you could see the smoky, heavily shadowed lids, heavily eye-lined eyes, and heavily-mascaraed lashes all the better. If only Depp's or Jolie's performances OR the storyline could have outdone those eyes, this might have been a better film. Depp and Jolie, instead, seem to walk through their parts. Oh, Jolie does a severely autocratic British accent well, with perfectly enunciated words, but it makes me wonder how many Brits actually speak like this. Maybe someone can enlighten me. In one scene, Angelina Jolie has large sunglasses on, her hair pulled back, and a black dress on. She may have even been wearing a pearl necklace, I've forgotten by this point. But, it struck me that she was being made to resemble Audrey Hepburn. This was very distracting to me during the film, as Ms. Jolie is no Audrey Hepburn. There are some humorous moments in the film, mostly from Depp's character and mostly of the stranger-in-a-strange-land variety. These moments are not enough to justify the Golden Globe nominations for the film and the actors in the musical/comedy category, though.I would like to know how the Golden Globes committee determine whether a film is a comedy. This film is as much a comedy as The Pirates of the Caribbean films are, or Knight and Day, or -heck - The Fighter made me laugh in several places recently, as did True Grit. But I don't consider any of them comedies at heart. Lastly, the storyline. Nothing new here. The fact that this film garnered any nominations in the acting and Best Picture categories is a bigger mystery than anything going on in the plot. There was only one moment in the film where I was surprised by a plot twist and this happened about three-fourths of the way through the film. By that time, I just didn't care. The characters weren't that likable, their romance not that believable, their chemistry non-existent. It pains me to say these things about this film almost as much as it pained me to watch it. And, believe me, I really don't like giving a negative review to a film that has the talent of Johnny Depp in it.",The Tourist

315,boyesbo,Great chick-flick -- had to go back a second time.,9,30 January 2011,"Rather than pretending that this is one of the all-time great adventure films, enjoy it for what it is: A remake of a classic crimi-lark, intriguing, romantic in a quirky Depp-ish kind of way, surprising, and just the movie to satisfy my need to Depp. Girls... this movie was made for US!!! And if you like a little subtlety in your films, you'll find it here. Maybe too subtle for some, but I had to go back and see the whole thing again once I'd gotten to the end. There was a shower of details that unfolded beautifully the second-time around. In fact, I'd have to say that Depp and Jolie are brilliant. Whether it was the director who brought it out of them, or the script, or actors themselves, I am liking this movie more and more (yes, I went back... again!).Once I have it, the DVD will go on my shelf in the ""Chick-Flick"" category -- movies that are very satisfying for a woman, and perfect for a birthday or shower. Especially if your women-friends are a little bit intelligent and like to be challenged.I seriously loved this movie, and would have given it ten stars except that there was not the continuity of style in the direction or editing that would have made it perfect. (Which goes to show how far a film can go on a good story, superb music, great chemistry and classy actors.) Hopefully Mr. Depp will not be smirking if he reads this review. Johnny, it was worth your time to have made the film. And Angeline was a perfect counterpart.",The Tourist
316,hussainmansoor81-827-583650,"Very predictable, very less substance in the story",5,15 January 2011,"The movie starts off in a slow pace, and goes on in the most predictable fashion, i came in to see some action however,there was none, a story which could have been told in 10 minutes is prolonged for a torturous 1.5 hours. Its about a private banker who snoops a gangster for 1.5 billion and disappears, now why would that have the British intelligence chasing him makes very less sense, the story claims its back taxes, but then how can he owe back taxes for a theft, utterly senseless. Regardless, as soon as i saw Jhonny Depp i knew for sure that this guy is the same conman, plastic surgeried himself into a new identity, and from their on was a no brainer whats coming nextif you can help it don't see this",The Tourist
317,ellibs07,Simply Entertaining,7,1 February 2011,"OK. Before watching this you have to throw out all preconceptions you might have about this movie out the door. Seriously!I have to agree it is not the best out there but i was not bored at all... I'd probably hate to admit it here seeing as to all the negative reviews i've seen here but DAMN! was i entertained. Depp and Jolie's characters although a bit dull, was portrayed as they should be. The two had quite a unique chemistry. Apart they're somewhat mysteriously dull but together they are quite entertaining.I just feel sorry for those who were really looking forward to some big explosions and lots of gun fights... but if you read the storyline ahead here on IMDb and as i've said thrown your preconceptions out before watching, i'm sure you wouldn't have been disappointed as much.At the early stages of the movie you'd have a pretty good idea of the characters' traits and background... and if you'd just pay attention you'd soon see why these characters had such commitment to the things they did.SPOILER ALERT!!! = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ""The ending would take you back to the beginning and that's where you realize the genius...if you know how to put two and two together and think if it were you, what would you have done?"" = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =I'm sure this movie is not for everyone, but it is at least for everyone that gets it...after all it would not have been nominated for 3 Golden Globes.Oh and if you're planning to, please watch it again and put those brain cells to work before you write your review.Overall, this movie is surely above average and i'd recommend it to anyone who'd like to relax and be entertained after a hard day's work.",The Tourist
318,suspekta_myself,i understand the bad reviews,9,10 July 2020,"This movie is not for all tastes. Wouldn't recommend to someone who loves action and likes predictable movies. This is more like a movie that needs all attention to understand it just capture you from the beginning, if you take your eyes of it , well you might just don't understand it. It has mistery , love, bit action and an unexpected ending ( for me) . I loved it and everyone who i recommended allso .",The Tourist

320,ArtHouseRoyalty,"Awful, Awful, Awful",1,6 December 2010,"I just returned from the premiere a couple of moments ago (it was on 54th street, I live on 57th). This must be one of the worst films I've ever seen.To think that this film was directed and written by the same writer/director of ""The Lives of Others"" just makes me sick to my stomach.It is one thing to see a terrible 3rd grade Hollywood flick in cinema with friends or family and another thing to watch it together with the stars, director and production company, all cheering and clapping to what is obviously a terrible movie.Everything about this movie is awful - the writing, the direction... even the cinematography - with some scenes lit as if it was a first year student film at NYU.But it really all boils down to the terrible writing and story - B movie jokes and gags, 3rd rate dialogue, a ridiculous last moment ""twist"", and a story that's far worse than the worst Bond movie.How bad is it? It ""reads"" like a Leslie Nielsen thriller parody. Wait... and even as a parody it wouldn't work.If I knew better I would think the script was written as an exercise by a 1st year student in some community college in Oklahoma.I'm devastated. This has ruined ""The Lives of Others"" for me, which up until two hours ago was one of my favorite movies. Everybody involved with this movie shouldn't be making films.It will be an awful flop at the box office and the critics will decimate it...Awful.",The Tourist

323,drosett,An old-fashioned star vehicle,8,8 July 2012,"Nothing more, nothing less. It's an anachronism, the type of escapist movie that Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn made in the late fifties and early sixties. It's supposed to have a silly twist at the end, all neatly tied with a bow.I just couldn't work up the anger and outrage that many reviewers have churned up about it. OK, so who would have guessed that Johnny Depp would be weirder playing someone normal rather than his usual weirdo roles? And who would really believe that Angelina Jolie would fall for an unassuming American math teacher? No one. That's why it's fun, folks. Just roll with it, taking in all the wonderful Venice scenery while you're at it. Seriously, this is an elegant film from beginning to end and it doesn't matter that it's more than a little preposterous.It's an escape, a European fantasy. Just laugh and enjoy it.",The Tourist
324,cestmoicestmoi,better see Anthony Zimmer,2,10 April 2011,"This film The Tourist could have been a pleasant half-thriller half-comedy on DVD for a cold Sunday morning in bed, with an eye on the newspaper, at the same time, breakfast on the way, a lazy mind and the will not to get worked up, with an actor whom I like a lot, Johnny Deep, and an actress pleasant to look at -even if seldom a great actress, Angelina Jolie-, when... I got that strange bad feeling,growing as the film was gradually unfolding -exactly what I was trying to escape from- ...Indeed I had seen the exact same story, but in a far much better film, which I loved, Anthony Zimmer, with excellent French actors, in particular Sophie Marceau -Yvan Attal also is great-, of which I have the DVD and have watched it several times since its release in 2005 -I loved the plot, the actors of Anthony Zimmer- ...Then the Tourist suddenly was becoming a very pale, even bad, copy of something which I liked... Suddenly Deep and Jolie were bleak, even-for once- acting poorly, badly... The copy didn't stand the comparison. I had suddenly shaving foam instead of Chantilly on my good ice-cream ! How come, that some Hollywood scum-bag without the smallest drop of imagination and talent also managed to copy so poorly a rather good French film ! I couldn't believe it ! So I log into IMDb in order to try to understand, to check if it was a coincidence, a little Hollywood writer reinventing ""by chance"" the same plot, or what ?! No, not at all, just a usual, official remake ! But worse, the vague bad taste in my mouth, became true bewilderment when I realized that the writer-cum-director of The Tourist is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, the German producer-writer-director of the marvelous Das Leben der Anderen (The Life of Others, 2006)... someone -a ""graf"" from a well-known noble family explains Wikipedia- who I discover here a is weird character; I had never investigated who was behind this wonderful worldwide success Das Leben der Anderen ! I discover here, that he almost never made anything else than these 2 films since 2002 (is film making a hobby for him ? does he benefit from a family fortune ? or a rich marriage ? Well, he now lives nowadays in LA -Ca, USA-, etc., etc.). The whole thing seems so strange ! IMDb indicates that The Tourist had an enormous budget of about USD 100 million, and made USD 67 millions ...IMDB ""forgets"" to mention the equivalent figures concerning Anthony Zimmer (?!), but its excellent little French brother www.allocine.fr mentions a cost of about  11 millions, so about 10 times less than its ""poor"" remake ! Roughly the box office for Zimmer was slightly below 1 million tickets sold in theaters in France; for The Tourist it was roughly probably (according to my own rough calculations) 10 times more worldwide ! All is said ! And Sony Pictures was the fat major behind The Tourist, at least contributing to the fat bank accounts of our two expensive lead actors Deep and Jolie ! Conclusion: after all The Tourist could possibly be a contribution to modern anthropology even if it is hardly more than another failure in the garbage bins and accounting books of Hollywood ! I was always bewildered by the intellectual and cultural weird need, state of mind and decision process of some Hollywood smart and rich asses every time (far too often) they decide to remake successful foreign (or old) movies with local (or younger) actors. At least with the remake of Cape Fear, for example, from 1962 to 1991 Scorsese brought the color on the screen and a true, more plausible and frighteing, ugly bad boy with De Niro, and modernity with a true modern family with a true young brat, a working mother and and unfaithful father... -and also the fun of using here and there the same renown actors-... Alas, here the Tourist, a very young and hardly justified remake, is a perfect example of these always tasteless and weird very expensive Hollywood cocktails without any imagination and talent, where in shaking apparently excellent and costly ingredients -plot, actors, maker, money- they once again end up with an extremely poor, tastelss if not bitter mixture, not even profitable ...just like, let's say, mixing and shaking an excellent old French bordeaux or burgundy, with warm Cola and fresh Orange juice, together with tons of fat milk !",The Tourist
325,lucgentet,Totally implausible,1,10 May 2011,"I can accept any premise to a movie. But what I expect is for the plot to unfold in a plausible way based on that premise. This movie fails entirely in that respect. There are so many things that could have gone wrong in the thief's ""masterplan"" that it's just ridiculous. For starters, who's to say he would be picked in the train rather than somebody else? Who's to say he wouldn't have been killed ten times over by the bad guys? How convenient it is for the head cop to come in at the last moment and order the killing of the bad guys, for no cop at all to stay behind afterwards so the thief is left to open the safe, etc... The twist is non-existent since anyone with half a brain has already guessed who the thief is half way through the movie. The acting by both Depp and Jolie is poor. And finally, the pace of this movie is too slow and makes the whole experience dull. Awful movie.",The Tourist
326,carinaoreyes,Grossly disappointing,3,25 April 2011,"Typically, you can still get some entertainment from movies with the likes of Jolie and Depp. This movie falls flat, way flat, so flat I thought I was going to fall asleep. I have no doubt that after Depp and Jolie watched the final edits, they took their money and ran. This movie will fall on that list you'd rather not claim in your hallmark of fame. Poorly scripted, poorly directed and honestly a bit disappointed with Jolie and Depp whose work I typically admire. It's not even worth $1.00 at Blockbuster. The climax, the ending and lack of action scenes left me wondering if there were any sense of direction. Must not see film!",The Tourist
327,gcfischer,Delivers About What I Expected,9,12 December 2010,"I found ""The Tourist"" to be an enjoyable jaunt... somewhat like another reviewer characterized it - a throwback to the Rock Hudsony sort of romantic, comedic, espionage action thrillers.Was it edge of the seat action? No, but it didn't seem designed to be, although it did have some satisfying turnabout-is-fair-play action moments. Was it deep, brooding, and introspective? No. That didn't seem to be its purpose, either.Overall, I'd say that the movie did a good job carrying a sense of romantic fun/tension between Depp and Jolie, illustrated in their increasing appreciation of each other - a good center for the alternately slightly bumbling, sometimes competent, but often one step behind, police and thugs.Finally, I'd recommend ""The Tourist"" for anyone who wants a beautifully photographed and satisfyingly interesting 104 minutes of entertainment without expecting it to be anything other than what it is, a solid romantic, comedic, action thriller.",The Tourist
328,unrightable,How could a person both love and hate the same movie?!,5,6 January 2011,"At first I was skeptical because of the genre and Angelina Jolie (yeah, I don't like her). Then I was willing to like it because of Johnny Depp. Then I started watching and hated it because of Jolie being so ugly and Johnny being so fatty and ordinary. And at last I kind of liked it because of the ending.So, finally, I'm not sure whether I like it or not... and I'm also frustrated by my not being able to decide.I find it a regularly lame movie - no interesting characters, no scientific fantasy, nothing special; just, as many say, Jolie's ass and lips and Depp's beard (not to mention he's so plump here that he's lost his hotness, I yet suppose that he's meant to look that way so as to resemble a math teacher). It's a peculiar fact that at the end when he opened the safe I thought that he's calculated the code somehow (knowing her + cryptography maybe). This was probably caused by the huge amount of Numb3rs episodes I've seen. Anyway...This ending was so unexpected that I ended up watching the credits with my mouth opened. Considering the fact that this is a remake of some French movie (which I haven't seen), the idea (which is the main ""weapon"" of this film) obviously isn't the movie-makers' credit.As I'm not a fan of this genre, it was an unusual movie for me to watch. Still, it's a great deal far from a masterpiece or something - I'm definitely not willing to watch it more than once.",The Tourist
329,viviandance,Too much of Jolie,5,5 February 2011,"Being a die hard fan of Johnny Depp, I could barely contain my excitement when I walked into the theater to catch The Tourist despite knowing the film was thrashed by critics. The appeal of the first time screen collaboration of two of the world's biggest A-list stars (their combined mega wattage could light an entire city) was too hard to pass on.The Tourist is classified as action, drama, thriller, comedy and romance. Many movies have found success with the fusion of genres but in this case, it seems like an unnecessary hodgepodge that rendered the underdevelopment of the movie itself. Although not a major downfall, but it left me feeling there is more to be desired. The plot of the movie is straightforward although there are many loopholes that could have crippled the movie in itself but are often overlooked in the beautiful scenery (excellent cinematography) and in the face of its stars. In fact, the supposedly clever twist at the end is clichéd and makes no sense in the play out of the story. At 103 minutes, it is not a long movie. It moves at a pace that is neither too fast nor too slow and is a good ride into the journey.Angelina Jolie is certainly ravishing (or ravenous ) but there are just way too many scenes of her walking into a room in slow motion where all heads turned to look at her as though she was in a perfume commercial. The nauseating, eye-rolling inducing overemphasis on her ethereal beauty made her surreal and hence difficult to relate to, not to mention did nothing to building her character. I suspect director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck created those scenes in hopes that the audience would be so spellbound by her beauty and not notice the contrived acting and dialogue.Johnny Depp is without doubt, one of the most sought after and versatile actors in Hollywood known for his quirky roles but in The Tourist, he looked dull (how is this even possible) and somewhat downplayed, despite being one of the two leads. His character injected most of the much needed comic relief in the movie and maybe it was just me, but there were traces of Captain Jack Sparrow in the funny scenes. I have to admit, I was surprised he was nominated for a Golden Globe for his role in the movie because although charming and absolutely lovable as he always is, it was not an award worthy performance.The biggest problem of the movie is perhaps these two megastars cannot share the limelight together. Putting Jolie and Depp in a movie together sounded like a genius plan hatched but instead of turning the movie into a golden goose, the film suffered at its own advertising of their stars. Both Jolie and Depp are extremely strong characters that can carry a movie on their own but together, it was a train wreck. It felt awkward watching them kiss. It almost felt incestuous. There is more chemistry between two rocks than between Jolie and Depp. One friend commented that Jolie never had chemistry with her co-stars but I pointed out her excellent chemistry with Brad Pitt in Mr and Mrs. Smith and my friend reminded me of what came out of the movie (poor Jen, I am still on her team) but I digress.The Tourist does not attempt to set itself apart from mainstream movies nor claim to be an intelligent movie. It does however, boast two of the world's biggest stars (you would not want to miss it if you are fans of Jolie and/or Depp), great supporting cast, breathtaking scenery (European tourism is set to boost after this) and simple, mindless fun. It is not as bad as people say, there were plenty of laughs in the cinema. Go watch with no expectations and you might be rewarded. Besides, there are far worse things to do on a Saturday night.",The Tourist
330,Cweige30,"Fantastic, beware of bias reviews!",8,24 March 2011,"After reading so many one-sided bias reviews I decided to give this movie it's own shot. I was thoroughly impressed. To hear so many negative reviews from critics who set their expectations higher than that of 'Roper' before ever seeing a movie is pretty disturbing. They seem to set the bar for failure before ever giving the film a chance. But that's not for now, this review is for an undeniably entertaining movie. I'm not one for long reviews, so quick and to the point. In the vain of all great romantic-action comedies (ie: Mr. & Mrs. Smith, Knight & Day). The Tourist delivers early on and continues well throughout the entire movie. Johnny Depp once again at his best, and the on screen chemistry between him and Jolie is fantastic. It's funny, exciting with enough spark and suspense to keep even the more action oriented crowd delighted. That's all for my review, I highly suggest giving this movie it's rightful day in court and achieving your own opinion of the film. As I have said, I find that I read more narrow bias reviews on this site than most, and have found 9 out of 10 to be mistakenly wrong and simple minded. Do yourself a favor and check this one out!",The Tourist

What a fabulous surprise, I watched it twice. I think it is brilliant, it is just light hearted, and watchable. They do have chemistry, as I noted someone else said they didn't and they look great - someone else said they looked awful. As if! But you know they are not 21 ! The whole thing is fun, and the combo of Depp and Jolie is magnificent.. It is rather like a light hearted better bond film, I love the setting in Italy, the English accents, the American. I Love the way Depp portrays himself as a Maths Teacher, humble and vulnerable and smitten. I think Jolie is brilliant her character professional and intelligent, and I love the line 'you are the least down to earth person I've ever met'V",The Tourist
332,shpointon,Boring...,4,4 October 2020,"Thé main cast is two of the most respected and honored actors of our generation, and yet, there is a surprising lack of chemistry between the two. Depp is uninteresting to say the least, and Jolie is beautiful and mysterious... and that is it. The dialogue is boring, the chemistry of non existant, the storyline is boring, character motivations? None worth watching the entirety of the film. There is Simply nothing enticing about this movie, nothing that has you itching for the next scenes. I'm writing this review 1:05:00 into the film with 39:00 remaining and it is so monotonous. I would never watch this film again.",The Tourist
333,jared5050,The elements were there.,5,13 December 2010,"Like I said in the title, the elements for a great movie were all there. The actors were fantastic. The scenery was incredible. The story was interesting. The script was perfectly fine. However, the editing of this film, in my opinion, is what ruined it. The pacing was so unbelievably slow. Even the one action scene in the film was a boat chase that looked like they were going a whopping 5 mph. As the movie started out, I enjoyed getting to know the characters. I enjoyed the chemistry between the two of them. I thought it was interesting that it was two adults falling in love, yet they had the nervous energy of adolescence. It was fun to watch. But then as the bigger pictures started to reveal themselves, the mob, the insider people, all that stuff, the movie still never lifted off. It continued at this overly slow pace. The relationship was still present, however, at this point it was the only thing that was holding the movie together. Then a few more twists happened, and the movie was over. Lame. I've seen worse movies in the past. Way worse. I expected this one to be really good though, so it was generally more disappointing than the average bad movie. I feel like if a fan edit came out of this, that would save it. Really everything was there, just the editing and pacing were terrible.",The Tourist
334,letoya30,The Jolie carnival,4,19 January 2011,"They should have named this movie The Angelina, instead of The Tourist, because it's really all about how beautiful this magnificint creature is. And maybe that's even a good thing. Because as a director you have to bring something worth watching to distract the audience from a truly awful storyline! OK, so we have a criminal on the run who's stole a bunch of money from his evil former Russian boss. And than we have eyecandy in the form of Angelina Jolie AND Johnny Depp. My two favorite actors in one movie! Too good to be true? A definite yes, unfortunately. Angelina plays Elise Ward, a mysterious woman who's in some devious business with her lover. She chooses a stranger, Johnny Depp as Frank Tupelo, she's met on a train to distract the police. She wants the cops to believe Frank is her lover and the one they are after.This doesn't sound too bad does it? Well it does when all men and women in the entire film are almost hypnotized by Elise and every time she walks by everyone almost break their necks too catch a glimpse of her. I mean c'mon we all know Angelina is beautiful, FHM knows it, I think even blind people know it, so there is really no need to put the emphasis on it all the time. It's kinda getting old. And what's up with the orchestra music that's playing every time there's a romantic moment between Depp and Jolie. This movie can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a romcom or an action flick. Of course these genres can mix together great, but The Tourist just jumps to one bad joke to another cliché and then back to a Disney feeling. I think this movie would have been great if the director just decided to go for a slapstick comedy, because it almost was already. Angelina's make up is perfect all the time, on a boat, in bed and in a chase and the way she poses on the promotion poster, that's her one look through the entire movie.I can tell the ending was supposed to be the great plot change, but it was just the crazy cherry on top of an already uneatable, boring cake. What a waste of talent of two of the best actors out there! I think they were short on cash. Desperately.",The Tourist
335,sonyasavova,Surprising and delightful!,10,19 May 2011,"I remember hating the high school literature papers we needed to do in our classes, trying to put in our words what the author intended to say in his masterpiece. That is why I usually avoid posting reviews here, they remind me of this time and all the effort that went into trying to say what was already so obviously stated and also so personal as an understanding. But I am trying here, because I find it strange to see how little we are used to think these days with our own brains. We expect to see (and may be feel) what we already have known or have seen and felt, we expect everything to taste and smell the same while there are so many different aspects that we might miss waiting for the so well known to come and make us happy once again. I have to admit I saw the movie twice. The first time, it was before one year approximately, I sort of reacted as most of the viewers here, who rated the movie quite low and expressed their negative feelings towards all that was in the film- plot, director, actors, etc. But the second time around I was actually very pleasantly surprised. There is an old saying that everything new that you see is something old (or at least not exactly new), but you are seeing it with new eyes. That is what happened with me and this movie. I couldn't read all the reviews here, but I saw several that would sound like me after viewing ""The Tourist"" for the second time. To me the film now looks like a very smart and visually appealing interpretation of some older ones, mostly spy-related, a la Raymond Chandler stories. The setting is overall very beautiful, colorful and rich, all the places and the whole atmosphere. The act is also quite good, seeing from this new point of view. But the biggest surprise for me came from the ending! Have someone though about the role of the Englishman in the whole story? May be I am slow in my understanding, but to me now it looks like the real main character, who choreographed the story, was exactly that Englishman, performed by Rufus Sewell. And Depp's character was exactly a tourist, just intended to become the decoy. If I am right assuming that than no wonder most of us missed all the beauty in the first place. ""The Tourist"" for me is a very well done film in the traditions of the real movie making, with so delicate sense of humor and even irony, that makes you smile long after the end titles. The only thing I actually did not like both times was Angelina Jolie. I see nothing appealing in a woman that looks like will collapse every minute out of hunger, or at least out of a severe weakness. She plays alright, but looks scary even in that wonderfully chosen wardrobe. Especially when I saw her in the wide shots. The rest of the actors were stunning!",The Tourist
336,kjhine,"An homage film, if ever there was one!",9,26 April 2020,"I was pleasantly surprised by this flick. While not quite a comedy, neither was it intensely dramatic. As others have pointed out, it was definitely a throwback. What came immediately to mind was ""This film is part 'Charade,' part 'Northwest by Northwest, part 'To Catch a Thief!"" Yes, all three were Cary Grant films, and although Johnny Depp didn't quite have the screen presence of CG, Angelina Jolie definitely captured the leading ladies of those films: Eva Marie Saint, Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn. And here's the spoiler alert...at the hotel, when his bags are taken from the water taxi, you get a hint that he isn't who he says he is, that he probably is who they think he is, and then everything afterwards falls nicely into place. At that point, sit back and let the rest of the movie unfold, with a sly knowing smirk that all will end well.",The Tourist

I kept falling asleep during the 1st half (I never fall asleep during a movie, I'm a total move dork) so the 1st half was very slow. I kept saying to my wife that it feels like 3 different movies crammed into one and then I just read on IMDb that it went through 3 directors and the final director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck left then came back. So the whole movie feels exactly like 3 different versions. It doesn't know if it wants to be a spy thriller, a comedic bond movie or a light romantic comedy? The dialouge was pretty bad and actors I think did the best they could with what they had but I'm sure originally there was a decent movie there but it looks like studio hands and creative differences totally fubared the whole thing.

339,yaydawn,Enjoyed it,7,14 December 2020,I enjoyed this film. I thought the locales were stunning. Both Depp and Jolie did a fantastic job and in my opinion the film would have been much better told from Depps character point of view..because it would have made the ending much more shocking..however since its told from Jolies character perspective..there are alot of missing pieces during the film that just dont make sense. The film just seemed choppy and it made the movie somewhat predictable. I really wish more hints were given throughout the film to clinch the ending better. Filming did seem a bit rushed at points.,The Tourist
340,niomithegirl,Awkwardly hilarious parody of a thriller,8,17 January 2011,"Looking at the reviews it seems like many viewers haven't understood this movie for what it really is - a comedy! THE TOURIST is an absolute parody of today's quintessential spy thriller, and the brilliance is that I went into this film thinking it was a drama and realizing by increments that it was the absolute opposite.20 minutes in I began to realize that one can look at it two ways: it could be an awful, awful attempt at a dramatic thriller with awkward lines and over-utilization of it's eye candy main leads. The look of the film, with plenty of Venice and Paris in the mix, is gorgeous - but Angelina Jolie is used almost as a setting in herself with so many long pauses for the audience to presumably savor the look of her. And the plot line, swooping music and script itself is stale and recycled.Or those awkward lines, pauses on Angelina, and god-awful Russian gangsters are something else: absolutely hilarious. THE TOURIST, whether or not it aimed to be so funny, succeeds in being a top-notch parody of traditional thrillers. By the end, the bizarre twists and humor had reached such a peak that I was practically crying from laughing! Watching actors Depp and Jolie interact is fascinating when viewed in the right light - it's a parody of a dramatic whirlwind romance, not a real one.Lighthearted and unexpected, THE TOURIST is hilariously awkward in the best way possible.",The Tourist
341,emmettkeck,Worth It,7,12 June 2021,"This is one of those rainy afternoon type of movies. It keeps your attention and makes you want to know what happens and to see how it plays out.Depp & Jolie have great chemistry. And you can't help but root for them to get that kiss, even if Depp isn't Alexander Pierce... or is he?Definitely more of a romance / mystery then it is an action / thriller in my books.",The Tourist
342,jean-levy,Excellent escapism,8,2 May 2011,"Watched this movie on Sky Box Office. Was not sure what to expect. Angelina Jolie often disappoints me (how special am I?) but Johnnie Depp I love . . . so on a Monday Night: I loved this movie. Excellent baddie in pursuit of his stolen cash. Wonderful representation of the constraints of British Intelligence (Paul Bettany presiding) . . . almost a page out of the Keystone Cops. Thank Goodness for Timothy Dalton, a man with an inkling of reality. Johnny Depp plays a convincing Wisconsin maths teacher . . . And Angelina Jolie driven by a heart that caused her to betray her professional imperative for the man she loves . . . even if he is a teacher from Wisconsin? The chemistry between Jolie and Depp was appropriate. Loved her collar. Loved her frocks. Was the fantasy in the hotel room real? Watched it again and still don't know. Poetic licence. Moments to cherish: the interaction of the bad guys . . . and the 'maths' moment with the safe was genius. And the perceived transitions: the 'higher forehead' . . . 'you sound different' What can it all mean? The accents were not overplayed (how can these actors do that?). And the final moments? How precious we have become that we might not recognise an enjoyable plot, a superb location ('not just anywhere') and the reassurance of humour . . . 'a guy's been sending me texts'. The postmodern literary critic with a desire for an alternative narrative and the ill-explained might not like this movie. On a Monday night in Sussex it was really enjoyable. Well done everyone. Well done Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. I can't say I don't wish him well.",The Tourist

I had been seeing the promo for 'The Tourist' and thought it might be worth a watch after a long day of sightseeing. I honestly did not walk into the theater expecting anything great. So, maybe my reaction comes from that perspective...but I ended up really enjoying it. It was fun! That's what it was: fun. I had fun while watching this flick. It is not to be taken too seriously, at all. This is not a deep/intellectual film. It is simply...fun. I look forward to watching it again! FYI--LOVED the ending! I only wish I could have seen more dialogue between Depp and Jolie...that and Jolie's make-up was a tad too much. But the end was a real jewel even though I had been hoping that it would work out that way. Anyway--the long and short of it is, in my opinion, that this was a fun flick worth watching.",The Tourist

But well it turned out to be a disappoiting movie. First of all , the story has so many flaws . At the beginning a women was being followed by a bunch of idiot police .Then she got into a train and suddenly go in love with a came-out-of-nowhere American tourist. what the hell ? and so on so many flaws till the end of the film. And i really don't know what kind of film is this ? Romance , action , thriller ? Not all of this, this is really confusing. Moreover , the action was terrible awful . A undercover agent was only capable of unlocking locks , no guns , nothing . So many man could not catch a women with bare hand . Omg how can this happened ??The ending of the film was also bad , how could it end such in a pathetic way ? Why the hell there were enough 4 snipers to shoot just enough 4 terrorists and then the film ended and why did you need a password to open the safe while u can easily use C4 or explosion ?so plz do not see this film , it's really awful .

345,naturta,The worst make up job ever!,5,10 February 2011,"I thought the movie just fine, exactly what you expect today. The only thing I cant get over is the make up artist of the movie. Depp looked like a doll with all the foundation and eye liner made him look like an ageing alcoholic, and Jolie never looked worst in any movie, the heavy make up and constant false eyelashes do not suit her. I found it very distracting and disturbing ! Otherwise exactly what I thought it would be, light, fluffy, predictable, but very easy on the eye, although some chemistry between two leads would be desirable! If you fancy an easy escape and nothing else is on, watch it, needless to say it is not for a repeat viewing.",The Tourist
346,joep_cremers,Darkish thriller turned into romantic comedy thriller,5,19 December 2010,"In order to understand this movie better you should have seen the original: Anthony Zimmer, on which the Tourist is based. Large parts are copied from it, mostly not improving on the original. The story is that Alexander Pearse/Anthony Zimmer - a financial genius who embezzled/whitewashed a lot of money is on the run for both the police and the Russian mafia and has had a complete makeover so nobody knows what he looks or sounds like - has turned himself into a very average person. He is then approached in a train by a glamorous woman who, on suggestion by a small letter from Alexander Pearse/Anthony Zimmer, marks this nobody as being the man wanted in order to offset the police and mafia. An important difference between the two movies is that Johnny Depp doesn't or isn't allowed to play an average type, his lines are but his posture isn't. This takes all the tension away from the train encounter and subsequent actions. I feel this is the main reason the Tourist never turns into the slightly dark thriller mood of the original, which was pretty cool, but in a rather predictable romantic comedy where characters are so clichéd the whole thing seems to turn into a Leslie Nielsen parody on the genre. I understand actors and directors have left and returned during the making. It would be interesting to know what the creative differences were. Also, I was not attracted to miss Jolie in this movie. The supposed natural elegance of her character was replaced by over elaborate hair, clothes and movements. She didn't seem to walk but float, perhaps intentionally adding to the cliché. Still, I found watching the movie to be an enjoyable experience, especially when you try to understand why something works in one movie but not in the other. It stays an interesting question why remakes so often do not improve on the original when you would think that having the knowledge of the stronger and lesser parts of the original beforehand gives you a head start. Apparently it's not that easy.",The Tourist

I did not find this movie interesting at all, i fell asleep in the middle of the movie, it was very boring and very dull and very dry.the only interesting thing about this movie was angelina's wardrobe, it was the only thing that kept me watching, just wanted to see what she was wearing.unless you want some thing to put you to sleep, do not watch it.",The Tourist
349,me-923-953239,OK! Could be better.,4,29 December 2010,"I must begin this review with a nag. The way the movie began really annoyed me to the point of interfering with my immersion from the very get go. I will say merely this to law enforcement in the movie world: If you are in a big black surveillance van that's been sitting outside the target's hotel room for days, or weeks, do not attempt to follow your target if they are on foot!!! ESPECIALLY down a quiet street with no other cars!!! Or at least put some distance between your vehicle and the target!But I was happy with the overall texture of the film. Finally, a film that actually has a bright tinge to it. And I'm not talking about story or plot or morals but the actual hue and colour saturation of the film itself. See, most films I've recently seen have taken place in this oddly tinged turquoise or mauve or other dull coloured world, ever since the late 90s when someone (the Wachowski's I believe) discovered the 'hue' knob on their editing suite and forgot how to reset it. 'The Tourist' takes place in a nice, bright, yellow world which made me feel like a tourist (ironically) taking a vacation from the other dull coloured movie worlds. Sadly this adventure into colour soon becomes a welcome distraction to the blandness of the main characters, played by Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie's lips. Here are two quite good A-list characters (and not pretend cardboard actors like Ashton Kutcher but real actors!) and they're playing two dull people. Not unlikable (like that horrible 'Monsters' movie) but just lacking in any romantic spark, which is the major gripe I have with this movie. The way Frank is written is OK in this respect; we get to see him pine, return and struggle for the heroine's attention and get assaulted a few times for it. But there's never reciprocation from Elise. Everything she does, from kissing Frank in the hotel to rescuing him, has an ulterior motive that plausibly outweighs any romantic affection she has for him. Even in the final tense moment when Frank comes to attempt a rescue, she's just annoyed that he's there! I suspect it looked good on paper when it read 'Frank enters room - Elise is visibly annoyed because she cares for him and wants him out of harms way', but not even a hint of 'oh thank god we got to see each other one last time!' Instead of choosing a lover, she ultimately hedges against losing both.What would have made this movie more than just 'ok' is if subtle hints of acting and dialogue build up to reveal that Elise in the end basically goes 'Screw Alex, I'm in love with Frank!' Which would have given the reveal (HAHA! But I AM Alex!) much more impact. Instead, what we get is Elise going 'oh gee I don't know, sod the both of you because I can't decide.' Forcing Frank to basically beg to get her back, and after all he's done for the ungrateful sod!Add to the above the su*B*tle (read obvious) transformation of Depp's character of Frank into Alex precisely when he's walking in the white tux smoking a real cigarette into the invite-only Ball (was 'I'm a jealous husband' seriously the best excuse he could come up with?) and the movie ends up coming off as a kind of Winner of the 2010 Annual Tobacco Industry Amateur Script Writers Contest. Winner, but still amateur. And because of all the cigarette smoking and the blatant advertising of the e-cigarette, I suspect the Nicotine and Tobacco industries will be the real winners of this movie.",The Tourist
350,Giulia-V,Did Johnny Depp read the script before saying yes to this part?!,4,3 February 2011,"Not so sure about the spoilers, but let's be safe Just watched the movie and I can barely put into words how bad it was. I like both starring actors, Johnny Depp is even one of my favorites, but he didn't shine at all in this movie. He was as dull aswell, a math teacher from Wisconsin? Guess that proves he played the part well, but, in fact, he only managed to be as boring as hell. I hated the cultural clichés, the unconvincing ""ButI love you!"" and the ultimately corny ""20 million dollars on surgery and this is the face you choose?"" Depp and Jolie are great when they get the chance to shine on their own. Put them together and you get no spark. Even the twist at the end doesn't make this movie interesting. After saying ""oh, give me a break"" so many times, the twist barely made me lift an eyebrow and mutter a ""Hn!""",The Tourist

It then is an arduous (albeit, a visually pleasant) wait to see if you got it right. The writer happily obliges! There is an early scene where a cop admires Angelina Jolie's derrière; his boss admonishes him and asks him to focus on the job. The director, on the contrary, hopes that we get distracted by the smoking leads and be surprised by the ending. Herr von Donnersmarck - that is asking for a lot!

353,fidelia-gamile,A little disappointed,6,26 March 2012,"The Tourist had some difficulty from the get go, having revolving doors for lead cast and the director even, before settling for Depp and Jolie, with Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who gave us The Lives of Others, at the helm of this Euro-thriller. Jolie plays Elise Clifton-Ward, an elegant clotheshorse who is tailed by a Scotland Yard team managed by Paul Bettany's Inspector John Acheson, who is dead set on keeping a mark on this female target so as to chance upon any opportunity to capture her main squeeze Alexander Pearce, the enigma of this story who has embezzled money from the mob, as well as evaded government taxes.In a betrayal of Judas proportions, Elise condemns her new acquaintance Frank Tupelo (Depp), an American math school teacher on holiday whom she deliberately picked out amongst the passengers as instructed for his close physical resemblance to Pearce, to being marked himself by Reginald Shaw (Steven Berkoff), the man whom Pearce had stolen from and is looking to recover his money, pride and seek revenge, which leads this film into a cat and mouse chase involving both the cops and the robbers after our two leads, who soon find it difficult not to fall in love after pulling through the ordeal they're under. But for their good looks and individual charisma, sparks didn't fly and you're constantly left wondering whether they would, or won't, and if there's always more than meets the eye.Even with great acting by Depp and Jolie, it's not enough to rate more than 6.",The Tourist

Particularly annoying was Angelina's pretended British accent.. what a disgrace. This film is so bad that Anjelina Jolie and Jonny Deep look ugly and unattractive. The story seems conceived by a 7 year old kid. There is an attempt to make the film look classy by shooting in Paris and Venice, it only adds to the sense of cliché and cheapness. The director of this film had made himself something of a legend with his first film (Das Leben der Anderen). With The Tourist, he has managed to destroy his reputation and damage it in a way that will never be restored back to where it once was.

Have they both reduced acting to merely WATCHING the scene unfold as if they are not part of creating it? 4. Has the director taken care of all the details but missed the big picture? 5. Is cleverness another word for tedious? 6. Is anyone as sad as me that Hitchkock is dead? No one seems to be able to combine mystery and elegance in one movie. 7. Is the director clumsy like he is trying to make paper cut-outs with boxing gloves on? Watch the movie with the director's comment on, and early on he says ""I didn't want to make a film that people would have to think about too much.""

The music used in the movie is well selected, adding fun to chase scenes. The romance is believable, starting slow and progressing through the film. Johnny Depp is amazing, as usual...he is quite believable as an American tourist math teacher caught up in random shenanigans in a foreign country. The way Jolie moves throughout the movie is a flawless floating look, totally believable that she was born to wear those amazing gowns even though I have never seen her play someone like this in a movie. I believe that too many people have taken the film too seriously. I think that this film was made to be a lighter, more fun, version of an action movie. This movie is not Mission Impossible.

361,Blackbuster-1,A Dark European Thriller (without the darkness or the thrills),6,10 December 2010,"Imagine a movie, imagine that movie stars two of the hottest commodities in Hollywood and add a sensual, somewhat dark French-thriller plot. If you did that, you would have the trailer for The Tourist, and it would sound like a pretty good movie, right? But then if you take away the words ""dark"" and ""thriller"" and realized that those sought after actors were actually last minute replacements, then you would have the actual movie.The Tourist stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in what appears to be a very promising plot. Jolie plays Elise, a beautiful and mysterious woman who ensnares spy-fiction fan Frank Tupelo (Depp) into his very own web of international crime and intrigue. Under the orders of Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) Scotland Yard's John Acheson played by Paul Bettany (The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind) tries his best to keep up Elise and the man he believes she is connected toAlexander Pearce.For what sounds like a fantastic plot on paper, the execution of it all leaves a little something to be desired. Perhaps the problem is with expectations. As stated before, the premise and the trailer and two actors who typically take on fairly meaty roles suggests that The Tourist would at least have hints of substance, instead the audience is left with a beautiful andfun movie that is essentially summer action fluff – think The Italian Job meets Knight and Day.The problems with the film almost assuredly were the result of apparently several casting and directorial issues during pre-production. Depp's role was reportedly originally slated for Tom Cruise, who was replaced by Sam Worthington who dropped out over ""creative differences"" and ultimately was replaces by Johnny Depp. Angelina Jolie's character was also apparently intended for someone elsenone other than Academy Award winning actress Charlize Theron. The director, German born - Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (Director of the Academy Award winning film The Lives of Others) also was a replacement and who he himself dropped out at one point, only to resume his directorial role later on. It seems that for whatever reason, no one wanted to be a part of this film.The Tourist certainly has its strong points. The visuals are simply stunning, whether that describes the beautiful European vistas, lavish homes and hotels or the lead actors, there is definitely eye candy everywhere. The action scenes are exciting and even the dialogue has some charm. However it seems that for every peak there is a valley. The Tourist like its pre-production story seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. At times the film feels intense and brooding, other times it feels like a carefree romp through the waterways of Venice. The dialogue and script have their moments of wit and charm while other parts feel like a reject Bond script. The Tourist is by no means a perfect film, however going in with realistic expectations; it may be just the way to end your night or your week",The Tourist

I was very pleasantly surprised and must say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. It had humor, suspense, beautiful visuals, intelligent storyline, and good acting from Depp and Jolie. Did remind me a bit of an old Carey Grant type movie, but there was no temptation to compare Depp to Grant, or Jolie to Hepburn or Kelly; it did not feel like a ""copycat"". As usual with JD acting, I forgot I was watching him and he was the character Frank, who was slightly annoying at times but very likable. Jolie was breathtaking and yes, very reserved, but this was in character, and her balance was perfect for the role. Excellent movie overall. Not really sure why it received such negative reviews from critics, but I am glad I don't usually listen to them anyway :) I suppose those who prefer gratuitous violence and sex in movies might find this one ""too tame"" but I found it subtly intelligent and highly entertaining, enough to watch a second time to catch some of the dialogue I missed the first time around",The Tourist

I am a fan of Depp in all his genres and Jolie too, having been so since I met her at Heathrow in the BA lounge a few long years ago.It's a return to the trans-European train riding, gun blazing, espionage and cold-war spy romp done with the sort of humour Depp excels at with the sultry tease but action packed character brought to life by Jolie. Think Mrs Smith on a solo mission in Europe.The story is setup aboard the Lyons to Venice TGV with most of the action taking place in Venice, ala James Bond on the waterways, with a definite tongue in someones cheek.",The Tourist

The trick is to reject taking part in this totally unnecessary popcorn waster movies.The director doesn't deserve a comment.

376,chickenshack9,Enjoy the movie as it goes,9,7 January 2011,"Great movie. For all of the naysayers out there that seemed to get the story wrong here is how you needed to see from the movie.First, the movie is not centered on Depp, it's around Jolie. The first 10 to 15 minutes are about her and her situation.Second, Depp never makes any statements about coming to Italy to grieve or escape from his ""loss"" of a wife. There are only two lines that mention any sort of women in his life.Third, the plot is not as far fetched as everyone makes is seem. Everyone seemed to be looking for a serious thriller or a romantic comedy, it is neither. This is a heist movie. Think of it like you would the ""Italian Job"" with funny moments here and there, but a serious theme throughout.For the critics that say that Depp was puffy and boring, I think that you are missing the point of the character. If I was a math teacher from Wisconsin and a women that looked like and was dressed like Angelina Jolie sat next to me and was telling me to ask her to dinner, I doubt that most guys would be playing all cool, they would be shocked. Depp embodied the way that most people would react in this situation.Spoiler alert: Skip if you don't want to know the ending!!! The ending is amazing. Forget what people are saying about ""I could see this coming"" or ""it was so unbelievable"". All movies have some elements that are unbelievable to them; this one will grab you and make you go ""dang"". Once you THINK about the story and how it has developed you will see how it all fits together. Everyone has mentioned how Rufus Sewell keeps showing up here and there and it makes no sense. Sewell's character is being told what to do by Depp, notice how he only shows up at the places that Jolie is told to go by her husband (Depp) the café, the hotel, the ball.END OF SPOILERS The ending is amazing and this movie is well worth the time and money if you let it stand on its own. Not every woman in Venice is trying to be Audrey Hepburn and Depp is not playing Grant. Let these actors make their own image and legacy. Enjoy the movie as you watch it.

Alex contacts Jolie, telling her to con an unsuspecting man (Johnny Depp) into tricking Scotland Yard, and the gangsters pursuing her, into thinking he is Alexander. What follows is the most predictable set of events you could imagine. Begin to think of any spy film you've ever seen. Now imagine it done poorly, to a shockingly bad soundtrack. You're probably thinking of a pretty poor movie. Well The Tourist is worse. It's stock, at best. The acting is terrible. FLAME SHIELDS UP. Don't get me wrong fan girls, I love Johnny Depp too, but he isn't even trying in this film. It may be his worst performance (At least that I've ever seen). It's predictable, boring and has the worst pace I've seen in any movie this year.

It's just that this for me had two charismatic people trying to be as wooden as possible, with no hint of irony.

It was funny and clever but would not include the word ""VERY"". These to can act much better than the roles allowed and it may show that good scripts are getting hard to find. It was a very predictable movie featuring Jolie, in a bad attempt to be made in the Sofia Loren of the 2000's. Depp is much more capable than what was portrayed.Technically it was full of misaligned out takes and such. The creators are in love with San Marco Tower whether they are traveling N,E,S,W, to or from the Piazza...you always saw the Tower. Water level shots show them underway (with the Piazza in view) but when they go to the same sky shot down, they are either going the wrong way or now where near the Tower. I've been there!:) When Jolie was walking in the train the doors parted automatically yet Depp had to wrestle with them. Their dancing...they would not have even made the try outs for Dancing with the Star. And how did Depp, while handcuffed to a stanchion, manage to get the towrope around a stern cleat! I must say though, I was impressed by the way Jolie can handle a water taxi...at least when she pulled up to the dock...unless that was a double doing the docking. In short, I should have waited for it to be on one of the movie channels...or maybe AppleTV as a rental. It certainly wasn't worth $24.00 I paid for and hour and half's worth of entertainment...and popcorn! Why did I buy that awesome home theater anyway? OHHHH! This is why!:)",The Tourist

All in all I would rate it more highly than any of the reviews I have seen so far. An enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.

The primary focus somehow seemed to be a preoccupation with Smoking! What a Ridiculous WASTE. I Feel SORRY for the Wonderful Talents in this film. It's just a Shame. I gave it 3 stars because of the rich talent and beautiful pictures. One scene was a little too over coordinated. (It's rare in Life to have outfits so conveniently coordinated with the furniture coverings.) However, I feel it was a saving grace by keeping our attention to something during this ordeal of distress. I liked the femininity of wardrobe they used to paint Angelina. She did an incredible job of maintaining balance hopping in and out, off and on those tiny boats. I shun to think the degree of damage done to the wardrobe being strewn over all the splintered boards. Also, how incredible to never have a drop of water to any apparel. This was not a Wardrobe issue, so I do not fault them. I believe someone will be struggling for projects long after this hits the floor. I am Upset for the Talent.

I think people are going into it with high expectations because of the two big name actors, but what people need to understand is this movie was thrown together in five months as a fun project to keep busy. In an interview Johhny Depp said they were all expecting it to fall apart at any minute because it was going so fast. So it's really no surprise that the plot line was kind of thin. They tried to put in as much entertainment as they could into this short filming time, and in my opinion they did a good job. If you're a critic looking for Oscar nominees, then, no, i wouldn't suggest this movie. But if you're looking for a couple hours of cute, fun entertainment, then see this movie. I left with a smile on my face saying ""I bet they had fun making that, because it was goofy."" Not every movie is an action packed, twist and turn thriller that will leave you dumbfounded at its philosophical breakthroughs. it was just a good time. if you don't go in with large expectations you'll leave satisfied. that kind of makes the movie sound worse than it is. but believe me. it really is a good show. the only other thing i have to say is that i am a fanatic of johnny depp, and i was not overly thrilled with his Joe-schmo performance, only because its not normal for him, though i think he did a splendid job with it and was comical. also i despise Angelina Jolie. i think she has no talent as an actress, is attractive by no means and is used for her name. all she did the entire movie was walk her waif bowlegged strut and squint her eyes in a attempted sultry stare, though i found it bitter, icy and self-absorbed. i cringed and shouted my disgust in the theaters during a mildly romantic scene between her and johnny.

This agent is trying to protect a man on the top 10 most wanted as he stole over £2bn from a man. This criminal was this man's private banker.

Not only was this sloppy predictable little eye-candy pop movie slow enough to make me sleepy, but the ""ba-da-boom"" ending (with the worst last two lines of any movie ever) put it on the brink of crush-killing.

The story for this film is a little weak to say the least, the direction is confused and genuinely you could cut a Perfume commercial from the rushes and this would be a much better use of the films footage, because Jolie looks amazing in the 12 (or so) different stunning dresses she wears throughout the film. The story never progresses, it never pads out, it's just a thin film... and if the photography had been a little more polished I would have let it off but it was shot like an indie in places, like an action film in others, then it became a drama.

Everything about Elise screams ""I'm the woman you want to jump right now"" as all of the the eyes of the male extras in the movie are constantly fixated on her somewhat alarmingly slim figure. Jolie's attempt at pulling off a mysterious woman tangled in a web of ambiguity is rather mediocre, however she does manage to glide from scene to scene as if she is secretly floating on some sort of hidden hovercraft.Johnny Depp was most likely drunk or on salvia when he agreed to play the role of Frank Tupelo, an American tourist visiting Italy to mend a broken heart. His performance is, as always, a brilliantly quaint one, but the lack of chemistry between Depp and Jolie is difficulty embarrassing to watch.Without ripping the movie to shreds completely, it's safe to say that this is one of the ones you watch on a tight-ass-Tuesday when the movie ticket prices are reduced and staying home is amongst the most boring of things you could be doing, but don't expect too much from the film as the storyline isn't necessarily the best thing since sliced bread.http://catandbee.onsugar.com/Movie-Review-Tourist-13003087",The Tourist

Depp was good in that first pirate movie way back when, but the sequels were just annoying and I haven't been impressed by anything he's done since. If Jolie really took this movie because it would be a ""'quick shoot' in Venice"" (See trivia), she really needs to sort out her priorities as a professional actress.Nothing in this movie was realistic. None of it was believable. The plot was your typical action movie: Someone's money gets stolen, they want it back, someone will get killed if it isn't returned, there's some romance, good guy wins. The ""twist"" isn't even a real twist; they hint at it earlier in the movie and it continues to be something you consider, so when you realize it's true you feel like you already knew. How is that a twist? It's not.I'm thoroughly convinced that the only reason people will see this film is because of Depp and Jolie. Neither gave a good or even convincing performance. Both were flat.

The story follows Mark Tupelo (Johnny Depp) and Elise Clifton-Ward (Angelina Jolie) through their chance encounter into a wild adventure through Europe as they try to evade authorities. Both Depp and Jolie played their parts beautifully and convincingly, Depp as a dorky American math teacher and Jolie as a stunning and cold English-woman who seems to have conflicting feelings toward Depp's character, Tupelo.For about the first half of the movie, the viewer gets swept up in the story line, wondering what will happen next, if Elise is going to save Frank or leave him helpless. More details are revealed about the pair's predicament and as the story progresses, the ending becomes slightly more predictable. However, this did not detract from the enjoyment of the movie.The Tourist could easily be compared to any other movie with a similar theme of good guys versus bad guys, but at the very last minute, this film ended in a surprising twist that I did not see coming.

Yet if you can put your modern expectations away for a moment, I think you will find this film is quite an enjoyable ride. The scenery is lovely, Jolie is glamorous, Depp is charming, the dialogue is witty, the twists are fun (if not entirely unpredictable), and there are quite a few laughs along the way. The purpose of the film is clearly to entertain you, not to make you believe these events could actually happen or to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time (though there are plenty of tense parts).

It was about the hypnotizing of it and how the director focused on each and every movement of Elice. this is what you call Avant-Gardie.",The Tourist

This movie is sickly, self-consciously slick, with absolutely no substance. Speaking of self-conscious. Lately, Jolie exudes a nauseatingly self-satisfied ""I am a goddess"" stature, that frankly, defies reality, as her last couple of films have been horrible. There is little doubt she is physically beautiful, but her hyper-consciousness of this dominates her demeanor. This movie had the look and style of a perfume commercial, with Jolie's self-consciousness permeating every scene she is in. Jolie needs a reality check. Her film choices are pathetic. And as for Depp in this film, he looked like he was stoned or just woke up, or both. I really didn't think this movie would suck as much as Salt, but I was wrong.

The story and acting were awful. Come to think of it - I cannot for the life of me understand why these two were paired up. It starts out as a James Bond meets Holiday in Rome mash-up but ends up as spoiled milk and super dry cookies. Whenever Depp and Jolie use their accents it sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Also, Depp's accent is a British Texan thing that makes him sound like a complete buffoon. Paul B is one of my favorite actors and he is reduced to being a slapstick circus clown in this misadventure.

Depp proved to be a comedic flop - he is so much better than that, no wonder they had them in the comedy section. The only think that was enjoying about the whole film was Venice the shots of the city were beautiful - a documentary would have been better showing off the country side. When Jolie drove the boat those were the stiffest scenes possible, I've never seen anybody drive a boat that way.

Except for this version being in English and arguably prettier people playing the main roles, the whole movie was a bad attempt to copy the original. Needless to say it bombed at the box office and with critics.

Angelina (Elise) has not ever looked more flawless, acted more  flawlessly, while Johnny Depp (Frank quintessentially summoned his  unseemly man one can't help but fall in love with. Is there a human who  doesn't love Johnny Depp? I don't think so.  They are never a step out of place. Smooth as glass, crystalline as  diamonds, they dance through this movie together. The direction is...  flawless.  The story line will keep you glued to the screen, the insouciant charm  will keep you entertained. The music and soundtrack are not ever  intrusive, but subtle and softly gorgeous. Reminds me a bit of  Tombraider. Musical passages that must be provided by the London  Philharmonic. No? Yes, I would just imagine so.  It's been a VERY long time since I had to restart the movie a second  time immediately after the first watch just to see the little twists  and turns and superb acting.  Rented this from Netflix... but will buy just to listen to over and  over again.  In a word, insouciant. And a delight to remember. Perfectly cast,  although it would also have been interesting to see Brad Pitt play the  staring male lead in perhaps, another version.  What a dilemma... can a girl marry both Brad and Johnny in their  dreams? If there was any flaw in this movie, it would be that the few  subtitles were the wrong font, and the wrong color...  : ) And perhaps, the Venetian canal waters were just a tad too blue,  clear and clean.

It's true that there is a mixture of genres to the film including action and mystery but, primarily, it is a comedy with a really interesting plot that draws you in right from the beginning.At first you think you must have missed something but you haven't.

Within this, Jolie and Depp play their characters really seriously which makes the comedy situations and wit all the more funny.I don't want to try to rewrite the synopsis of the film, which is clear enough but just want to say, don't be put off.

It's a police thriller. Duh. And, yes, there isn't that much shooting, and it's quite slow: well thank goodness for an intelligent, taught, police drama. My guess is that this will grow on people with time and that it will come to be regarded as much better than the initial reactions.

He said, ""no."" and, right then she had to curtsy in the dance - like she was saying, ""okay. you're the boss!"" There were SO MANY unspoken, wonderful things like that!! SUCH A GREAT MOVIE!!!

Some good lines and great interaction between Angelina and Johnny.

But, Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp are respectful and kind to their fans. The acting was perfect in this movie, from both Angelina Jolie & Johnny Depp's performances.

Although it has an amusing and even surprising story line, it leaves you with nothing when you step out of the cinema. None of the performances catches you as a great job. Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp are good choices to attract the fans to the cinemas and they will almost quench their thirst of seeing sensually powerful Jolie and smart Depp with his charming sense of humor. But you think everything is formulated. after all that chasing and hiding and surprising themes, there is nothing about human being or conscientiousness that stays with you after the movie.

The ending was something I had guessed in the beginning, so I thought it was too obvious to happen. However, it did and I wasn't disappointed with the ending. I thought they could have cleaned up Depp's mustached and beard a little, and the whole time I wanted to take little scissors and snip the little hairs that were oddly hanging over his upper lip, only about two under each nostril. Needless to say, this bothered me and took away from the movie. I thought it was funny how in the beginning Jolie sauntered toward the café in her prim and proper dress, the way she shook her hips because she knew the police were watching her. When I was watching it the first time I was wondering why she was shaking her hips like that, but as the movie progressed it was a funny little thing that you only understood later in the movie. Jolie was glorious in this movie, and I don't usually care for her movies, they are mostly weird, off the wall type of flicks, as Depp's are. In fact, I almost didn't get this movie due to the fact that they were in it. However, I thought the storyline sounded good and watched it without any high expectations.

I continue watching it on TV, every time when I pass through the channels, I stop on it. The film is beautiful, pleasant, easy to watch, relaxing. I am not surprised that the public didn't return the millions to the producers. Usually the public in these days like ugly, scary tattooed criminals, bloody screens, cruel scenes with murders, gays or lesbian making love and kissing each other surrounded by children, everything ugly and horrifying inundates the theatres. It is so pity that the public is not educated well to like the good! The times changed and there are no values anymore. It is a pleasure to watch Angelina Jolie well dressed, with beautiful make up but not so beautiful Johnny Depp. The role fit for him, but I think the environment in the exceptional city of Venice, the romantic screenplay, the music, the luxury, required more handsome man to play the role of the teacher. The movie would be really perfect. Paul Bettany does an excellent job. He was the best for this role and couldn't play it better. I wish I would see him in more films.

She plays the woman of mystery with poise and style. I liked Johnny Depp - he was sweet and charming. Paul Bettany was good, Timothy Dalton was priceless (it was like watching what James Bond could be in the future, if he lived that long).The rest of the cast were good.The problem was that this was in essence a thriller where the romance played an essential role, and therefore a lot depends on the chemistry between the 2 leads. Jolie and Depp played their roles well but there was no spark between them.

It had a touch of comedy and romance but not any big action scenes or sex scenes, like in Salt or Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Its a little like the Ocean's movies. Fun, cool, interesting with a bit of romance. The ending was good. I was very pleased with it and I usually don't like how most movies end. Anyone excepting a dark thriller will be disappointed though. Any Jolie/Depp fan or someone looking for some fun will enjoy it. Everyone and everything was gorgeous. You can tell how much attention they paid to all the details and it really paid off. Angelina and Johnny looked great and had good chemistry. You could tell they enjoyed each other, but only as friends. (Not like Brangelina in Mr. and Mrs. Smith or how the tabloids implied.)",The Tourist
437,Lecourbe-14,"Light, sexy and very funny - 7/10",7,11 December 2010,"OK personally, this is just my opinion, I enjoyed the movie. I have to admit that the negative reviews somehow helped me to go into the theatre with an open mind. There are some critic reviews out there that are so exaggerated and you wonder if they actually saw the same movie. I think they expected too much from the great director that is Florian as well as the talents of the writers. And somehow in their own right, the critics wanted this movie to be a blockbuster type film which is clearly not. From my understanding it was only suppose to be a light thriller/action with a hint of comedy and more so romance. I believe the movie ticked all those boxes.Yes the plot was lazy and overly clichéd and yes the acting was, well, OK. But really the actors weren't given enough depth of a material to work from. Angelina, from what I could see, did her job well. Johnny on the contrary seemed uncomfortable and sometimes his response to some scenes in the movie made it feel unbelievable.Nevertheless, the movie was what exactly it was suppose to be. Although it could have been improved greatly and certainly could have been much much better. Most scenes were funny and others made me smile a lot. It was very much a light-hearted romantic-comedy with action-scenes-thrown-in movie. I must say Angelina looked her best since Mr and Mrs Smith. She was beautiful in the movie. I had to gasp every time she had a close-up. She looked so elegant and graceful which makes you angry because she's so stunning, you want to pinch yourself. Johnny is Johnny, you know. He looked good too.Overall, it's just one of those movies that you enjoy for what it is and nothing more. But of course you enjoy it for the actors' beauty and the location too. It's just a movie where you just relax while taking in all the beautiful elements. They were saying in their interviews that you're not suppose to take it seriously, and by not taking the movie seriously and going into the cinema without any specific expectations, I ended up enjoying it, very much.Yes it is worth your $10 or your 8EUR. The movie is worth it. I give it 7/10.",The Tourist
438,dickson-tim,a great light movie,8,5 July 2013,"This is a nice light hearted piece of entertainment, only spoiled by 2 uses of the ""f"" word by one of the characters. It manages to lead you on through the whole narrative until toward the very end to disclose the punch line. It also bares re-watching as you'll be surprised by some of the detail missed the first time round. There is a good bit of action, but generally the pace is slow and leisurely, with the focus building up to the the end of the movie. Angelina does a good job as Elise the woman of intrigue, playing the audience to her figure which helped make her famous, and Johnny does a reasonable job as ""the tourist"". If it wasn't for the two profanities, this would have got a 9 or 10 for a good evening's easygoing entertainment.",The Tourist
439,funcii,Laughable appallingness,1,9 May 2011,"I have never since the birth of the internet felt compelled to write a film review (if you can call this that, rather than just a moan) but in the same way in which I would feel obliged to report the existence of a freshly belly-split roadkill deer to avoid a small child from happening upon it, I feel I have a moral duty to warn people that this film lies around the corner if they are not careful to avoid it.The acting is hopeless, which can't in the main be the actors' faults since most have given us performances in the past ranging from 'sublime' in some cases all the way down to 'much better than this' in many others. I got the feeling that Mr Depp in particular was just going through the motions, perhaps looked almost embarrassed at times (hey we've all got to pay the rent, Johnny), but even Ms Jolie and her unfeasible lips, who you'd think would be much more in their element, seemed not to find their feet. As it were.The whole thing seemed incoherent at best, laughably bad at worst. The 'plot' is utterly ridiculous. It's not even ""so bad it's good"" -- it's ""so bad it's really, really bad"". I kept hoping it would get better, that stuff would start to happen, that we'd have a decent action scene, that I would not just be sacrificing two hours of my life to this dross, but no, none of the above.Caution: fresh roadkill. AVOID.",The Tourist
440,usmc12455,Jolie and Depp,10,31 December 2018,Angelina and Johnny preform wonderfully in the Charade style movie. Johnny Depp does a great job of playing the unsuspecting tourist. He leads down a path which makes you question whether he really is Alexander Pearce. Angelina does an outstanding job of making you at guessing who might be the real Alexander. Enjoyed every minute.,The Tourist
441,x24rocks,Is exacly what it's ment to be,7,30 January 2021,"This isn't the best movie you are going to watch, It wont have the most action or be the most suspenseful but it uses those aspects to create a good film.
Both leads are well known which may lead to more expectations for the film then are warranted. Both leads play their parts well and are well chosen for the roles, the supporting cast also does its job but the role they play is simple.The story is actually compelling for me but the reason it gets a 7 is that parts of the story can get confusing and with very little backstory told there is a lot you have to infer yourself.
The Lead her role is clear and her motivation is clear, His role isn't so much they do bury the lead early on in the film if you catch it but it seems unintentional, for me it just seems that there might have been at little more they could have done with him.
Last for me the action they do have makes me feel like I'm watching a movie and that takes me out of the story.
Overall Good film, Slow pace, Great location and good for re-watching or relaxing.",The Tourist
442,john000115,Sparkling romantic comedy reminiscent of Golden Era Hollywood.,7,25 December 2010,"The marketing for this film was a classic example of misrepresenting a film.Sold as a high octane thriller the film is in fact not that at all,rather it's a deliberately paced,laid back old fashioned romance-you could call it a light romantic drama or a romantic comedy with thriller leanings.It's reminiscent of Hitchcock's great comic romantic thrillers TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST and Norman Jewison's THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR as well as Connery era Bond.A remake of the excellent ANTHONY ZIMMER,THE TOURIST follows same plot as that film but the execution here is very different.Whereas the original was a straight romantic thriller which was quite fast paced and more kinetic this version has a very different chemistry to it.It's a love story more so than anything else and is much lighter and frothier and more comedic than ZIMMER.Impressively directed by Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck,it's a wonderfully old fashioned and charming slice of romantic whimsy the likes of which we don't see anymore.It runs at a very specific tempo and has a very relaxed feel which may be part of the reason why it hasn't connected with audiences.Depp and Jolie are both very good in the leads and despite what people are saying do in fact have chemistry together.It's not a massive combustible chemistry a la MR AND MRS SMITH or OUT OF SIGHT,it's more understated,but it's definitely there.Also,Jolie looks possibly the best she's looked on screen to date in the film,the woman is breathtaking.There are flaws-unfortunately Paul Bettany is lumbered with a rather one dimensional role but nothing that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.Personally i found the film to be something of a gem-a genuinely charming and quite beguiling slice of old fashioned romantic fantasy and i'd wholeheartedly recommend it.7/10.",The Tourist
443,petertillert,just don't watch it with high expectations,5,1 November 2015,"Venice looks good on pictures, and so do Johnny and Angelina. Of course, the latter two would look even better in pirate outfit and tank top, but hey, you can't always have it all, can you. Actually, looking good is the only thing the two of them can do here anyway, because the script doesn't leave them much opportunity for any real acting. Instead, the script tries to play on ""mystery"" and presents us with a couple of ""surprises"" that make us go ""oh, really?"". Still, I think the whole thing is entertaining enough, if there's really nothing else you have to do with those 103 minutes of your time and if you leave the great expectations at home, which obviously burdened the writers of all those two-star-reviews. I do not agree that the movie would be much different if it had been shot in late fifties, starring Audrey Hepburn or whoever else.",The Tourist
444,edgarhany,Really so beautiful!,10,26 December 2010,"Oh my... This movie is so beautiful and charming! Put Deep and Angelinain one film, and Paris and Venice, can't be wrong. ""The Tourist"" is funny, sexy and very intriguing. You really want know what happened with Alexander Pierce and why Elise get involved with he. Johnny is brilliant, but Angelina Jolie is very hot! It time she return in a part sexy and provocative. And ""Elise"" is a different character for Angie, she is a lady, very elegant, quiet. Very different of Lara Croft, Jane Smith, Fox, Evelyn... Also, the movie's landscapes are lush! I confess: i don't expecting a great movie, or great history, but this movie surprised me. Really this movie don't is ""movie for Oscar®"", but he fulfill its duty: Guaranteed fun!",The Tourist

I love both actors, but seeing The Tourist was a waste of two hours and $10 I'll never see again. I felt I was duped into the ""Support Angie and Johnny for Christmas Foundation"", and wish I had waited a week for the reviews. The plot was predictable, I mean, within the first five minutes predictable. The lines were few, although that may have been a positive, because they were so boring. If I had ONLY gone to see Harry Potter again! That would have been time, energy and money better spent.",The Tourist

449,john_winson,Don't Waste Money to Watch This,3,25 March 2011,"This movie could have been a good thriller. The plot seemed familiar in a good way; it kind of reminded me of a couple of old Hitchcock movies and Johnny Depp is good enough actor to make you wonder right up till the end whether or not he is who he claims to be. Johnny Depp was great, he did his part. Angelina Jolie was good too and I generally don't care for her all that much. But whoever did the sound track for this film should be taken out and shot in the street, the score to this movie does more to strip this film of any intensity than anything else. The villain is like a bad caricature of villains we've already seen a million times. The scene with the boat chase was just stupid; it looked like a Disney ride and the hired henchman were such bad shots with their hand guns that you would never suspect that anyone was ever in any danger at all. They pick an amazing location to film the movie, they get some good on screen talent, they spend a fortune, and this is the best they could do? Seriously, the overly romantic soundtrack thoroughly killed this movie all together for me personally. If you don't believe me watch The Tourist and then watch a fun thriller like Alfred Hitchcock's Charade. Music goes such along way.",The Tourist
