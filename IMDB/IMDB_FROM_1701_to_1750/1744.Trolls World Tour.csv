0,SnoopyStyle,fine family film,6,1 May 2020,"There are more trolls in the world. In ancient times, the trolls divided into six different tribes, each celebrating different genre of music and each with their own music string. The Rock trolls led by Queen Barb (Rachel Bloom) intends to unite the trolls by taking the other tribes' music strings. Queen Poopy (Anna Kendrick) receives an invitation from Barb but Branch (Justin Timberlake) is much more suspicious.This Trolls franchise has a specific audience. It's young kids who love bright colors and pop music. This one will appeal to that audience. It's very bright, and sparkly. Kendrick continues to be a great voice for Poppy. I didn't really recognize Bloom and Timberlake is not that distinctive. It does have great voices like Ron Funches. As for the story, it has a good concept. The ending theme is fitting. It's a simple sequel which works well. I do wonder if the next sequel should include a true villain. Barb never struck me as a true villain and her eventual conversion was never in doubt. Overall, this is a brightly colored movie safe for the whole family in the time of pandemic.",Trolls World Tour
1,nogodnomasters,This is gonna take a lot of hugs,8,25 April 2020,"Anne Kendrick in another musical for kids and with the ever-popular diversity theme. Poppy discovers there is a world outside of pop. Queen Barb of hard rock wants to make all the world rock turning rock into the antagonist of all music. The film would have had more meaning in the 1980s. I thought ""Good Times"" was disco and not pop. Not much thinking involved. One for the girls.",Trolls World Tour
2,kosmasp,Rock/rap/pop/classical music on,7,12 May 2021,"The Trolls are back ... in village/town. And if you got a song reference there, you might be the right recipient and the right one to watch the sequel here. It has been a while since I saw the first Trolls movie, but I would say these work independently. That being said, I did rememeber the character and who spoke them.But as with every good sequel (or I reckon every sequel for that matter), you get a lot of new character thrown in the mix here. The movie had the bad luck (as many others) of having to be released in a year that we got hit with a pandemic - hello future readers! So it might have been quite more succesful and more on the radar of many more people.The story is quite simple and predictable. It is the songs and the voice cast that really carry the movie along. It is more than fun ... just go with the flow ... or even sing a long! More colors than you can bear probably.",Trolls World Tour
3,jboothmillard,Trolls World Tour,7,29 October 2020,"The first movie was a colourful reinvention for the well-known Troll dolls, created by Thomas Dam in the late 50s, becoming a fad craze in the 80s and 90s, most popularly as pencil toppers. Unfortunately, the sequel was delayed by cinema closing during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it almost didn't make it back to cinemas at all. Odeon Cinema and Universal had a disagreement over the release of the film, being available to rent on streaming services. For a while, the cinema chain refused to screen any Universal films (which would have included Bond movie No Time to Die), but eventually they reached an agreement, and I went to see this (for a much cheaper price than it would have been for rental) at the cinema. Basically, it is not just one tribe of Trolls, there are in fact six tribes, all representing the musical genres Pop, Rock, Classical, Country, Techno and Funk. Each tribe has a magical string that powers their specific genre of music, and each tribe lives in harmony separated from each other. Queen Barb (Rachel Bloom) is the leader of the Rock tribe and intends to steal all the strings of each tribe to power the magical guitar that will play a powerful cord to rule all kingdoms under Rock music. Poppy (Anna Kendrick) has become the Queen of the Pop tribe, the happiest of all the tribes, with singing and dancing being the most popular activity. Her closest friend, Branch (Justin Timberlake), has feelings for Poppy and longs to express them, but cannot find a way to do so. Poppy finds out about Queen Barb and her ""World Tour"" from a poster and is mistaken into thinking that she wants to be friends and unite their worlds of music. Her father King Peppy (Walt Dohrn) warns her about Barb's true intentions, but Poppy ignores him and sends a message to Barb expressing her excitement to become her friend. Poppy decides to travel by hot air balloon to meet Barb in her kingdom, Volcano Rock City; Branch joins her, along with friends Biggie (James Corden) and his pet worm Mr. Dinkles (Kevin Michael Richardson). On the way, they fly over the Classical musical kingdom, and find it has been destroyed, and their string taken. The group next wind up in Lonesome Flats, the home of the Country trolls, led by Delta Dawn (Kelly Clarkson). Hearing their downbeat music, they try to cheer them up with a pop medley, but wind up thrown in jail. They are rescued by Hickory (Sam Rockwell), a smooth-talking Country troll, and they take a raft to the Rock kingdom. Barb, angered by Poppy being nice towards her in her message, has hired many bounty hunters to catch the group. They encounter Chaz, the Smooth Jazz Troll, who hypnotises them playing his saxophone. After Biggie is prompted to leave, after Poppy breaks her ""pinkie promise"" Hickory defeats Chaz with gumdrop earplugs. Meanwhile, Cooper (Ron Funches) embarks on a quest to find trolls like himself, but a spaceship beams him up. He learns he is a lost prince of the Funk trolls, raised by the Pop tribe. Poppy's tribe are beamed up in a spaceship, where they encounter the Funk trolls. They tell the story that all kingdoms were separated by their different tastes in music, and they tell Poppy that differences matter. The Rock trolls hijack the ship and steal the Funk string. Poppy is captured, and the Pop string is taken by Hickory, who was secretly a Yodel troll, one of the bounty hunters looking for them, with his brother and partner Dickory (Flura Borg). Biggie urges the Pop trolls to save Poppy, while Branch stops an argument between the Reggaeton and K-Pop trolls and convinces them to work together to save all of music. Barb imprisons Poppy and plays to an audience of captive trolls. With the guitar containing all six magical strings, Barb uses its power to turns trolls into Rock zombies. Poppy is seemingly transformed but reveals she was wearing gumdrop earplugs. Poppy stops Barb and smashes the guitar, restoring possessed trolls back to normal. But she also destroys the six strings, stopping the flow of music and taking all troll colour and happiness with it. With her plan foiled, and the troll world reduced to silence and no colour, Barb blames blames Poppy for destroying music and ruining everything. But Cooper hears his heartbeat and amplifies it to a microphone, while Prince D (Anderson Paak) creates a rhythmic beat with it. Slowly, the trolls joim in with other forms of sound-making, thus reviving the power of music. In song, Poppy encourages everyone to sing together and their colours and happiness are restored. Realising how important other forms of music are and encouraged by her father Thrash (Ozzy Osbourne), Barb has a change of heart and joins in, regaining her colours, and accepting Poppy's friendship. Branch finally confesses his love to Poppy, who feels the same for him. Back at the Pop village, everyone performs together, and all Trolls are finally reunited while celebrating their differences. Bridget (Zooey Deschanel) and King Gristle (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) arrive to the Pop village, unaware of what has been happening, and worry they have missed the party. Also starring George Clinton as King Quincy, Mary J. Blige as Queen Essence, Kenan & Kel's Kenan Thompson as Tiny Diamond, Anthony Ramos as King Trollex, and House's Charlyne Yi as Pennywhistle. Timberlake and Kendrick are well chosen voicing and singing, as are the supporting cast members, as with the original film, this sequel is a visually scrumptious and upbeat experience, featuring a surprisingly great soundtrack of songs, including reworked and sampled favourites, a most enjoyable family animated musical adventure. Very good!",Trolls World Tour
4,westsideschl,Interesting Premise,8,29 August 2020,"Six troll tribes each representing one of a half dozen musical genres. Once they sang together in harmony now they are isolated from one another.
Techno, Country, Rock, Classical, Funk, Pop. Should R&B, blues, and World music have had a go at it?
The question is can they acknowledge differences while still working together or are one or more out to dominate the others?
Song choice OK; good, but might have been better. Voicing good. Animation good. Plot - novelly interesting.",Trolls World Tour
5,briancham1994,"Bright, colourful, topical",7,31 May 2020,"Sure, this film has a suspicious similarity to The Avengers: Infinity War, but it pulls it off well within the Trolls universe.

6,cruise01,"Colorful, weird, and fun musical for kids and adults",7,12 July 2020,Trolls World Tour (3.5 out of 5 stars).Trolls World Tour is a pretty fair family film that follows Poppy and Branch going on a journey to stop Queen Barb who is trying to take over every troll kingdom by taking there music style and forcing rock.It is a cute and fun plot with a theme and message about bringing everyone together no matter how different you are with beliefs and looks.The voice cast is fun. The musical sequences are fun. I liked the music choices being played. The animation is colorful and over the top. Some of the animation may be over done. The humor may be a little repetitive as well. Sure kids wont mind.,Trolls World Tour
7,pennyelenabooks,Not Good Enough,4,15 April 2020,"So, Trolls World Tour... Well, the concept was interesting, about different genres of music, though they kind of made a sweet mess out of it.

8,leonblackwood,The first movie was much better! 4/10,4,19 August 2020,"Review:
As I felt slightly entertained after watching the first movie, I thought that I would give this movie a chance, even though I didn't hear a good word about it. Like many sequels, it turned out to be a pointless film, with an average soundtrack, but it works in the ""family day out"" department. The vibrant colours and singing/dancing trolls will keep the kids quiet for an hour and a half, but from an adults point of view, it's pretty weak from every aspect. There are hidden messages, in terms of making the world a better place, even though we're all different, but apart from that, it's a one watch in my eyes. They had an opportunity to make something special because it's a movie about all different genres of music, so they could have introduced some unique and funny characters, for all ages, but it all seemed a bit too safe. On the plus side, the animation wasn't too bad, and there are enough elements to carry you through the film, but like many films I have seen this year, I was expecting more, especially from Timberlake. At the end of the day, it's what it says on the tin, but don't expect any outstanding moments that will blow your mind. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Walt Dohrn, who also co-directed the original Trolls movie. He also directed 12 episodes of SpongeBob Squarepants and Shrek's Yule Log, so this is basically his first time in the director's chair for a major release. Although it made a profit, it was released at a difficult time because of the pandemic, so the studio must be happy that they made their money back. With that aside, the mixed messages throughout the movie confused the critics, but they praised the concept because of the state of the world at the time of release. It did seem like the director followed the Thanos concept, in terms of the gathering of six strings to make the world a better place, so it lacked originality, but it's harmless fun for the whole family.Budget: $6million
Worldwide Gross: $9.5millionGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy, Musical
Cast: Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Rachel Bloom, James Corden, Bon Funches, Kelly Clarkson, Anderson .Paak, Sam Rockwell, Mary J. Bilge, Kenan Thompson, Kunai Nayyer, Jamie Dornan, Zooey Deschanel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Ozzy Osbourne. 4/10",Trolls World Tour
9,digitalbeachbum,A watered down sequel,1,7 June 2020,"Holy crap, what a terrible sequel. Is this the best they can think up?The first movie was so much better with the plot. I am glad that we at least didn't pay the full $20 that was originally charged.I thought the first five minutes was going to be good, then it all fell apart. The underwater scene really pissed me off.The characters are lacking in continuity. The plot is stupid. The script has terrible dialog. It sucked completely.

But will Branch(Timberlake) and Poppy(Kendricks) who are trying to be more than friends save the rest of the trolls from the rock trolls.The music is catchy,the cast is good and we also have a new song called The Other Side by Justin Timberlake and Sza.

12,kevin_robbins,The storyline for this is good enough to keep your attention but not great overall.,7,18 June 2021,"Trolls World Tour (2020) is a movie I watched with my daughter as soon as it came out. The storyline involves a larger Trolls universe where you see how other trolls live. One group of trolls, into heavy metal, feel all trolls should live like them and sets out to make that happen. Can our friends from the previous trolls picture stop the invading trolls? This movie is codirected by Walt Dohrn (Trolls) and David P. Smith (The Powerpuff Girls: Dance Pantsed) and contains the voices of Anna Kendrick (Pitch Perfect), Justin Timberlake (The Social Network), Sam Rockwell (Iron Man 2) and George Clinton (Good Burger). The storyline for this is good enough to keep your attention but not great overall. I did like the use of music but felt the movie had a strange way of cutting the songs I liked short and making the long music scenes just okay. There is a good lesson or two in here and it does have some worthwhile coming of age elements. This is an above average addition to the genre that is worth a viewing but not adding to your DVD collection. I'd score this a solid 7/10.",Trolls World Tour

15,aidanratesmovies,Not as bad as I thought it would be at least,5,4 September 2020,"Admittedly an improvement over its predecessor, but ultimately too shallow to be anything too significant- Trolls: World Tour surprised me by not being the godawful film I was afraid it would be- but is a bit too messy to prove to be anything worthwhile. This film is a bit all over the place, trying to manage all these worlds that just now suddenly existed- it stretches the film a bit thin. That being said, I was very entertained watching it, and found the animation itself to be some of Dreamworks best in recent years. Its song covers were at times rather cringeworthy, but with some improvement on how they handled it from the first film. The whole Rock antagonist thing seemed incredibly forced, and kind of offensive- if that's the right word for it. It almost seemed like they pinned all Rock fans and players as some sort of Nazi regime, and it felt incredibly odd to see them portray it in such a way. I wasn't a big fan of any of the voice actors in the film really, as with the last one, but I did enjoy Sam Rockwell's small performance as Hickory in the film- as he always brings the most to every role he plays, no matter how small. The story was engaging, but rather silly, and many elements of this film were absolutely ridiculous- so ridiculous, I could hardly tell if they were supposed to be funny or not. In the end, Trolls World Tour isn't as bad as I thought it would be, but its not great to say the least. It has potential, but feels a bit overly ambitious, crowded, and a bit muttled at times- though it does prove to be entertaining all the way through, and does prove to be a lot better than the previous flick.
My Rating: 5.5/10",Trolls World Tour
16,rgkarim,"Touring New Music: Trolls 2 is Fun, Energetic, And Yet Still Missing It's Potential",7,11 April 2020,"It's been a long time my friend, but fortunately a nice opportunity for a review came up in the form of a home release. While not the arena I prefer to watch my movies in, it's better than nothing and so tonight I take on the world release of the latest animated film that is hoping to make some money by feeding on youth's ability for rewatching for the musical experience. Tonight's film is that musical melody of animated characters that was charming, kooky, and super fun when they debuted a few years ago. And after a fun Christmas special, many wondered what would be the fate of the colorful band of trolls? We get that answer tonight, as more genres join our pop theme in:Movie: Trolls: World Tour (2020)Directors:

Lack of Real Impasse/Obstacles

Almost Felt Too ShortSummary:Much like the first film, I expected the trolls next tour to be cute and fun, and I was not disappointed. The youthful vibe of the world somehow awakened the happy side of life for me, and got me into the spirit to dive back into the simplistic imagination of the world. It's ridiculous concepts, well developed dialogue, and good comedic timing held much of the essence of the film and was a great anchor point for older audience members. Some of the fun also is held in the song references that they covered, new twists to fan favorites that though had a nice twist, kept much of the core elements of the song to still hold what entranced me to the song itself. As the trailers highlight, the movie is all about exploring the musical culture of these genres, and I give them props for creativity and exploring the levels of the big genres, which I like again being the geek I am. All of this exploration happens at a good pace, with little slowness present as the Trolls hope effortlessly between kingdoms in search of the sacred strings. Amidst the journey are of course fun life lessons, which with an open mind/heart and a little luck will help motivate and teach you some good lessons, or at least the young ones accompany you. Further review made me happy that the developers actually took time to spend some focus on the other trolls, managing to deviate from the two protagonists and integrate them more into the story. While not perfect, it's a step in the right direction and with a little time and focus... we might end up getting that perfect balance. So if that troll merchandise feels like it went to waste years ago, you can rest assured those dolls may get new life. Let's face it though... Trolls is a big soundtrack and the new tracks are there ready to storm their way into your ear drums and leave you with massive ear worm. World Tour's tracks are catchy, fun twists that hit most of the genres and bring that essence I mentioned earlier, to bring out the feeling and energy of the scene. I appreciated the variety they had to offer and fully enjoyed the magic this movie had.Yet for all the fun I have, I won't lie there are some major limitations to this film that still have not been mastered. First off, character development is much weaker for me in this film. A sacrifice of including so many characters means their depth sort of suffers and World Tour has no problem dropping deep dives into psyche for the superficial succulence to come. Poppy and Branch have some expansion, but pales to many, and even the new characters hold little in the ways of diversity and deep stories, including the antagonist that had so much to give. The result is a bland story, where potential lies in every note and scene, but then falls flat in terms of really expanding the world that we were baited with back in 2016. What also does not help is the movie is that the challenge and threat in this movie is... well missing. We've seen animated films that bring the hammer with antagonists who are threatening, massive, and push our heroes to the limits to fulfill the quests. Not the case with this one, Barb's got edge, skills, and a wickedly designed arsenal, but it's a little too one sided and boring in terms of an animated adventure. In addition, the time in each world is rather limited, and that potential for creativity is lost to rapid passthroughs most of the towns. Even more bizarre is that the heart and soul of the movie, the music, is reduced too sound bites, quickly dropped just as the number is reaching its crescendo. Sure the numbers at the end do their job, and others are entertaining due to the vibe and twist, but it's not feeling quite complete compared to its predecessor. Overall, the movie almost felt too short and needed another 1.5 hours to really get everything I wanted in this sequel. Yes, I'm saying a longer movie, or maybe another movie that held that fire and balance I love.The VERDICT:Overall Trolls 2 comes back with the fun, cute, wonderful energy that made the first one so exciting. If you are like me and have the pleasure and luck of texting a friend with references, you get more enjoyment out of the film. Kids will love it alongside the young at heart, with silliness, laughs, and morals entangled together to give that satisfactory kids flick you love, plus the music does not hurt either as long as you are not a purist. Yet, the movie still has not found the art of balance for reviewers like me. All the new characters are great for merchandising, but miss the mark in terms of emotional investment, and the story is okay but again had so much more it could have given. Even the things I was enjoying the most like the adventure and music got edited down and while they are fun during their moments, they could have been so much more. Still being at home and looking for something to break the ice of Frozen 2, this is a fine rental to have at home and probably the best place to watch outside of the effects. Thus, my recommendation is give it a shot this weekend when you can.My scores for this film are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0

17,Abdulxoxo,Generic....,5,3 July 2020,"Ok what is this? Please stop making sequels. It's not always good as the original. This sequel is somewhat lame and generic, all the jokes urgh felt forced and weren't not funny. I like the concept though different kinds of trolls with different kinds of music uhm not bad. It's colorful as ever. There's one or two good songs there. I hope there will be no part 3.",Trolls World Tour
18,blott2319-1,"Good for fans of the original, but otherwise worthless",4,26 June 2021,"Trolls World Tour feels like a perfect sequel to the first film. It tells the ongoing story of the characters that people would know, broadens the scope of the world they created, and even diversifies the music that they cover throughout the movie. I have to imagine that fans of the original would be entirely pleased where they went with the franchise. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the original, I don't care one bit about these characters, and it's a world that I didn't need to see expanded in any way. It's a shame because I like a lot of the talent in this film. I'm a sucker for every single voice actor they lined up for this one, and I love some of the music they sample. There are artists here that I know others find a bit unpleasant or irritating, yet I have no such problem with people like Kelly Clarkson or James Corden. It's the story that utterly failed to draw me in as it went down predictable routes, and even included some blatant plot holes.Trolls World Tour is trying to do something interesting, but it manages to do it in the least interesting way possible. It's so obvious making rock-and-roll the villainous presence in the story, because that's been the cliched image of the genre since its inception. Perhaps the strangest thing is the visual look of the heavy-metal rocking trolls and the mellow and toned-down version of rock that they actually sing in the film. I'm sure they didn't want to blast the ears of their young audience out, but the difference between what this movie considers rock and what this movie considers pop is imperceptible. I also think there's some irony in the fact that Trolls World Tour seems to be advocating that there is a place for all these different musical styles to exist in their own space, and yet they have compiled them into a calculated and homogenized film designed to appeal to as many people as possible. To be clear, there's nothing bad or broken in Trolls World Tour, it's an acceptable film, but lacks anything to make it special.",Trolls World Tour

20,Anurag-Shetty,Not as good as its predecessor.,7,25 November 2020,"Trolls World Tour continues with the adventures of Poppy(Anna Kendrick), Branch(Justin Timberlake) and the rest of the Trolls. When the queen of the hard rock Trolls, Barb(Rachel Bloom), wants hard rock music to dominate every other kind of music, it is up to Poppy, Branch and the rest of Poppy's allies to stop her.Trolls World Tour is a good film. However, it didn't necessarily have to be made in the first place. The 2016 original, is a much better movie. In comparison, this sequel feels like a cash grab. It has its moments though. The humour however, is mainly meant for very small children and will not make any person over the age of 10, laugh. The animation is wacky & superb. A note on the vocal performances. Anna Kendrick is outstanding as Poppy. Justin Timberlake is spectacular as Branch. Rachel Bloom is excellent as Barb. James Corden is hysterical as Biggie. Ron Funches is amazing as Cooper. Sam Rockwell is brilliant as Hickory. The supporting cast is perfect. Trolls World Tour is not a must watch.

Ozzy freakin Osbourne, yes even though he have a little part and dialogue he's still very cool here, Trolls World Tour is not a movie or a sequel that everybody can like but it can be great and likeable especially for those who love this kinda thing, highly recommended""",Trolls World Tour
22,kjproulx,A Sequel That's Better Than The First,7,10 April 2020,"Well, this was an interesting watch for me. Even though I liked Trolls for the most part back in 2016, I still admitted that it was very average. Over time, I have looked back on it as being more and more mediocre, even though it had some fun moments. Upon seeing the trailers for the sequel Trolls World Tour, I did nothing but shake my head, thinking it looked like utter garbage. To my surprise, I watched it and actually thought it was a better film than the first. Sure, there are some heavy-handed messages and not everything works, that's for sure, but I think it's a great movie for kids to watch. Here's why (shockingly) I think all families/kids should check this one out.Trolls World Tour pretty much uses music as a metaphor to replicate the real world for kids to understand. Instead of countries and certain characteristics dividing people in our world, it's the different genres of music. Spread out throughout the world, there's Country, Rock, Funk, Pop, Techno, and Classical, with many others in between. The writers decided to make Rock the villain, having their leader wanting to take over the world of music. Barb who runs Rock, wants to turn everyone into a rocker, to look and sound the same. Our main characters from the first film in Poppy and Branch, go on a mission to prevent this from happening. There are a few more complexities to the story that make for some great lessons for kids, so I won't dive into those.I thought the messages throughout this movie were far better than the ones in the first Trolls, but like most movies made for kids, the metaphors themselves can get a little lost in translation. It's very clear what they are going for, but when younger audiences watch this movie, they probably won't quite get everything. Still, it makes for a basic outline of how our world sort of works, which is absolutely a plus. I thought the messages were a little too lost to the point that it actually hurt the movie overall, but there was still a lot to enjoy.I will admit that the overuse of popular music in all genres was a little generic, but I guess the target audience probably doesn't even know most of the music being played, so I can also give a pass to that. Trolls World Tour has two goals in mind and I believe it accomplished both of them. It aims to be a pleasing, fun experience for kids, while also providing some very solid life lessons. If a film that's aimed at kids can pull off both of those, I truly believe it earns its place.In the end, Trolls World Tour probably won't win over those who couldn't find any enjoyment in the first film, but it was a better film overall in my opinion. The animation is vibrant and fun to look at, the characters all have new arcs, and the world was expanded on, all of which are things a good sequel needs.

A good sequel is just hard to make, but I think they had a good concept with the world tour music theme.I still don't think you can get a cuter sounding troll than Anna Kendrick, but I kinda wish they'd try to see if they could find one. If there was someone who could be a cuter troll voice, it would definitely be interesting to know who it would be. Justin Timberlake also makes a great troll voice, but I believe I said this about both of them in my review of the first movie (not that anyone actually reads these).",Trolls World Tour

33,movieman6-413-929510,The second Trolls movie is simpler and less creative.,4,7 August 2020,"Trolls World Tour is the sequel to the first Trolls movie from 2016. The film is directed by Walt Dohrn and David P. Smith. Both have directed more episodes of children's series for this.In the film, Poppy (voice of Anna Kendrick) and Branch (voice of Justin Timberlake) learn that in addition to pop trolls, there are other troll tribes.
The queen of rock trolls Barb (voice of Rachel Bloom) tries to take over the other troll tribes and collect their strings, leaving only rock trolls with their rock music. Poppy and Branch must stop her in order to balance the harmony in the troll world and allow each troll to keep playing their own style of music.The first Trolls film is a fun family film, which is more aimed at children. This sequel is unfortunately not that good or creative. The story is very similar to the story of Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame where different groups have to collect six different stones. In this movie, the heroes and villains try to collect six different strings. In the first Trolls film they also managed to make their own music and songs, which makes the film more unique. In this sequel only cover songs are sung by the cast of popular songs.The film tries to teach the younger audience about music and the different music genres. They also try to bring up a message that you have to accept each other's differences, but due to the weak script, this message unfortunately does not come out so strongly in the film. Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake and the rest of the cast know how to sing the cover songs in a good and fun way in the film. Other cast members such as James Corden and Sam Rockwell also provide fun comedy moments for a younger audience.Dreamworks has made the film with beautiful animation images, but it is not much better than the first Trols film. Parents better watch the first Trolls film on Netflix together with their children and otherwise wait until this sequel is also available",Trolls World Tour
34,chubarova,Good animation.,9,13 April 2020,"If you have children you should show them this animated film. If yoy don't have children you must watch this animation because it's very kind animated film, however we don't have enough kindness in the news our days. Firstly, the story is quite interesting, with some adventure features. Secondly, the world of trolls is shown perfectly, you can see different trolls from pop to rock one. Thirdly, the music is one the most important part of Trolls, there are different types of music in the sequel. Finally, the animation technic is good, trolls and their world looks very smooth.
So, it's very kind and funny animated film for all ages.",Trolls World Tour
35,bhernandez2216,Rock and Roll,8,13 April 2020,"Not bad, not bad at all, honestly. Trolls: World Tour, is good, but I like the first one better, because one of my favorite part of the first film is that when Poppy sings Get Back Up Again, and then there was a butterfly and they they all get eaten, and then she's like: It's going to be a fantastic day. Don't get me wrong, I love Trolls and they have all good songs and every good joy of all the fun. It's a pretty good Rock and Roll Trolls film of 2020",Trolls World Tour
36,solojere,A Decent Sequel,8,14 January 2021,"Overall, Trolls World Tour was a cute movie kids movie about how it's okay to be different. And while I think this is an important message, especially for a post-2020 world, it did feel at times like it was a little forced. Don't get me wrong. I liked the movie but there too many storylines for just an hour and a half movie. The villain was also kind of plain. I think it would've been smarter just to focus on Poppy and Branch's relationship, and then the rest would've fallen into place. I defiantly think they are a cute cupule, and their relationship really sales the movie. Also, I felt the idea to include all types of music sidelined Anna Kendrick a little bit. I would've loved to have had her sing more like in the first one. But the songs she does sing are great. It's sad that this movie didn't hit theaters because of the pandemic. However, it's definitely still worth watching, and with the world the way it is right now, a little preaching about being kind to people who are different from you isn't a bad thing.",Trolls World Tour

39,gilleliath,Classical music and Techno of equal significance? Right!!,5,31 December 2020,"The original Trolls had a stupid story but it was irresistible with its charm, good vibes and some songs I ended up liking in spite of myself. Here you have an equally stupid story but without those other things. It feels forced. I suppose I should applaud the attempt at greater musical diversity, but in the end their ideas of music are so limited that it's almost like Bob's Country Bunker who, of course, 'have both kinds - Country *and* Western'. The songs don't seem as good - but then, if you like the film you'll like the songs; if you don't you probably won't.The other thing is that, if there's a form of music out to destroy the world, it's not rock, it's rap. Rock is peripheral for kids these days - which I guess is why they chose it as the bad guy.TV and film these days are always promoting a superficial, apparent diversity. But all they really want, and all we really see, is more and more sameness and conformity.",Trolls World Tour
40,isaacochoterena,I don't think we needed a sequel,5,18 October 2021,"In this movie the main plot is more conventional than the first.In this film there are more conveniences and incongruities in the plot, there are many characters that have no development and at certain points it is slow.

41,eelen-seth,Trolls just wanna have fun! - intoscreens.com,7,14 April 2020,"Once a global toy phenomenon, Trolls found new success on the big screen in 2016. Making about 345 million USD at the global box office, a popular Netflix spin-off series wasn't far behind - although that show didn't have any similarities animation-wise - and a sequel announced to open in theaters March 2020. Then just like the Bergens invading Troll Village, COVID-19 struck worldwide, with all of us hiding in our homes. Just like the risk-taker we know Universal Pictures is, they decided not to push back the release of Trolls World Tour, and instead launch it on VOD-platforms all across the nation. A game changer in cinema so it seems after a very successful first weekend.Poppy (Anna Kendrick - Pitch Perfect) and Branch (Justin Timberlake - The Social Network) discover that they are but one of six different Troll tribes scattered over six different lands devoted to six different kinds of music: Funk, Country, Techno, Classical, Pop and Rock. Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder. A member of hard-rock royalty, Queen Barb (Rachel Bloom - Crazy Ex-Girlfriend), aided by her father King Thrash (barely voiced by rock legend Ozzy Osbourne), wants to destroy all other kinds of music to let rock reign supreme. With the fate of the world at stake, Poppy and Branch, along with their friends, set out to visit all the other lands to unify the Trolls in harmony against Barb, who's looking to upstage them all.2016's Trolls was for sure made for children who like sugary sweet pops of colour, and hyper-energetic scenes filled with music and silly jokes. What really stood out for those few adults who thoroughly enjoyed the first installment was its voice work and inventive animation style. This sequel amps it up and gets louder than you thought possible, while exploring similarities and differences between music and their inhabitants. The message is also very clear: we are all different, but that doesn't mean we can't work as one united world and all get along. World peace has never felt more real than hearing it come out of centaur-looking troll voiced by Kelly Clarkson, with hair as high as the sky - yeehaw.Old favourites, such as Biggie (James Corden) and Mr. Dinkles (Kevin Michael Richards) join our two main Trolls on an across-the-map journey, while Cooper (Ron Funches) finds his own path to an undiscovered family history that could help his friends and all of Troll World. But not before Queen Barb can do some serious damage, and hidden secrets revolving the true history of Troll World rise to question everything Queen Poppy once believed in. The only thing missing from the entire narrative, that was so established in the original film, are the Bergens. There's literally none to be seen. Maybe their story had been told and the writers decided that it was time to explore some other ground. In saying that, let's hope these warty looking klutzes are back for what could be a ""Trollogy"" unlike any other. Although the first Trolls-movie had a much fuller storyline, this sequel is so much more fun.Trolls World Tour delivers exactly what you expect from it and never fails to awe you with a beyond-your-imagination mix of animation styles and lots - LOTS of glitter. Dreamworks shows they're not done and dusted just yet, in what for sure will keep kids occupied while parents try to work from home. With a fun soundtrack in the background, this time including some reggaeton, K-Pop and soulful jazz-tunes to complete the never ending list of music styles, everyone will be able to bop their heads to it, because ""Trolls just wanna have fun"".",Trolls World Tour
42,andyajoflaherty,The Trolls phone it in,6,21 September 2020,"Maybe its enjoyable for kids, but I think even kids will be able to see that this film is vastly inferior to the first one. The plot is not anywhere near as interesting, the soundtrack nowhere near as good and the antagonist is woefully underused. Considering the 'bad guys' listen to rock, there is a distinct lack of rock music. Also, they look like metalheads, so... why don't they listen to... you know... metal?

The humor is rather funny and it kinda reminds me of the humor from The Lego Movie, the style, variety and the visuals of this movie is also perfect. Grasslands, sandy places, cloudy sky areas, it literally makes me think of the world of Super Mario or Kirby. And the moral also makes sense. The moral tells us that we need to learn how to accept differences, especially people's differences.

45,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Trump Needs To Watch Trolls World Tour,7,30 September 2020,"Welcome all! Stream to Big Screen is here to fill your brain with content. On the eve of the first Presidential debate of 2020, I thought I should watch something uplifting before the debate depresses me even further. So I went to a franchise that's brought me much joy over the last couple years, Trolls. Trolls World Tour is the follow up film to Trolls (2016). In this film, we follow our beloved Queen Poppy and Branch as they discover that they are but one of six different Troll tribes scattered over six different lands devoted to six different kinds of music: Funk, Country, Techno, Classical, Pop and Rock. As their world gets bigger and louder, so must their hearts when Queen Barb tries to take over and destroy music. High stakes for Poppy, Branch, and friends, but let's see if it's worth finding out the result.I'll tell you now that the storyline is predictable and unimportant. THE MESSAGE that we get from the storyline and songs, on the other hand is quite important, especially during this current time of divisive speech, social unrest, and political conflict. Inclusiveness, tolerance, acceptance and sharing are all worthy themes that are found throughout the film. This is a message that our current President, members of Congress, and each individual across the globe need to learn and truly embrace. Ok, enough of the feel good messaging. Trolls World Tour does plenty of that.Let's talk about the rest. The movie feels similar to Trolls, but in a way, it fails to live up to hype. We fell in love with Lady Glittersparkles and the lowly Bergens, but we got none of that magic. The characters we do get in this sequel are great, but there may be too many of them. We have ""yuge"" starpower in this movie. From Kenan Thompson to Kelly Clarkson and Mary J. Blige to Justin Timberlake, Trolls World Tour allows each to hit their moments but, boy, we could've had more. The songs in this movie are heartfelt and charismatic. The jokes are pointed and hard-hitting but there aren't enough. Trolls World Tour could've been purely a song fest with some comic relief, but unfortunately, there is too much chitter chatter. Yes, the chitter chatter furthers the great message but the songs make you feel it much more.Needless to say, Trolls World Tour is meant for teaching our future tolerance, respect, and love for the differences between each of us. This is a message that all leadership needs to endorse and follow. For that, Trolls World Tour is not a must see but I can promise you that you'll enjoy the tunes and laughs. Grab a bowl of popcorn and charge up your karaoke mic because the world tour is ready for you.",Trolls World Tour
46,Clank_Zoka,"Not a Great or Terrible DreamWorks Film, But It Did Try a Little Harder Then I Thought",6,7 April 2020,"Trolls..., one of DreamWorks' most popular animated films..., but also one of their worst films, not completely terrible but, you can tell that they only wanted to sell toys and music then tell a interesting story, yeah It's got good voice acting and colourful animation but it's not enough to make it a good film, so I dreaded when they announced a sequel, I thought it'll just be the first one but worse, I mean what else can you expect from a sequel to ""Trolls"" out of all things?, well since a certain virus has stopped me from seeing it in cinemas, it actually came to digital which I thought was a good idea, better then delaying like what most of the upcoming films are doing, it wasn't cheap but..., I had to see this since it's animated and it's DreamWorks, what could they do to make this already annoying film even more annoying?, well I gave it a watch yesterday and...... It did try, a little harder, not much of a improvement from the first film, but there was a little bit of effort despite a good chunk of flaws, so let's talk about it.Turns out there are more trolls in the Troll Kingdom then Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and the Trolls gang thought, their are different kinds of genre trolls out there, there is Classical, Country, Techno, Funk and Rock, however the queen of rock named Barb (Rachel Bloom) wants to take over the entire Troll Kingdom with rock, however to do this, she needs all six strings, one from Classical, Techno, Country, Funk and Pop which is what Poppy, Branch (Justin Timberlake) are from, now Poppy, Branch along with Biggie (James Corden) has to go on this quest to convince Barb that music is different and that she doesn't has to destroy it, okay I think going into this, we all know what will happen, especially with the theme and the story, we all know how it'll end up, like the first film, the story is easily one of the worst things about the film, it relies on being cliched, quite predicable and using a lot of filler, it has a story, but it's kind of pushed to one side, since this is sort of a musical with a lot of recognisable dated songs like Gangnan Style, Tell me What You Want, and so on, it gives the film this very Irritating tone that it wants to keep your kid's attention rather then tell a interesting, that and the humour isn't all that effective and the film can give viewers a headache by how fast the tone, humour and chase scenes can be, HOWEVER!, I can say this, even worth all those issues, the film does try a little harder then the first film, first off the concept for this film is kind of clever, one genre of music tries to overshadow the other genres, it's kind of a relevant topic nowadays since one genre of music gets more attention then others, it's a clever allegory also, also the humour is much better, even if there are some annoying moments, the plot is somewhat interesting at least and the third act is kind of what really saves this film, even with how predictable it is, it gives the film something related to it's theme and starts to get experimental with it's songs and genre, while I can't say this plot is great, even with it's same flaws, but at least it did try a few things and was slightly more effort put into this in the first Trolls, but not by much.The animation is actually one of this best things in this film, same thing applied in the first film, but here it's more creative, more colourful, it has more style, the new areas these characters go to are unique and stand out from each other, a lot of these characters has creative, cute and nice designs, the gags are funny and unpredictable like the first film, I like all these different creatures that are in the film, the scenes that includes the Trolls breaking into song brings the creativity and fun looks like the animators are having fun with what they are working with, however despite it's effort, there is one thing that kind of bothers me, the way it's rendered is weird, like whenever one of the characters move or run it feels a bit out of motion and stiff, I know it's supposed to be fast past, but it's kind of distracting and even though I love the colours, it can sometimes be in your face too many times, but besides those small nitpicks, the animation can truly shine with a lot of it's creativity.The characters are a bit mixed, the old characters don't offer anything new that much, but the new characters are so much more interesting and has personality, the Trolls from Pop are really just themselves, The Twins, Smidge, Fuzzbert and even King Peppy don't even do that much expect either try to be funny or to create the journey, even Poppy and Branch hasn't changed at all that much, they are just the same characters like before, Poppy is trying to prove that she can be a great queen with her happiness and positivity, while Branch is looking out for her and being quite doubtful, they are not awful, but they do get tiring and bland, even Branch who I kind of liked in the first film is just kind of there and doesn't do much, Biggie is kind of pointless and he doesn't do much besides helping Poppy and Branch and is the comic relief, Cooper doesn't do much besides looking for similar Trolls and even his screen time is pointless, however the new characters are actually a lot better then the original characters, my favourites are Hickory (Sam Rockwell), Delta Dawn (Kelly Clarkson), King Trollex (Anthony Ramos) and the main villain Barb, all of them has great designs, they are great comedic timing, they are interesting and play a key role in the film, with Hickory being my absolute favourite character in the film, how unlike half of the characters, the voice acting is what makes these characters, well... most of them tolerable, Anna Kendrick is fantastic as always, same with Justin Timberlake, James Corden is just himself as always, he's just okay, Sam Rockwell's voice performance as Hickory is probably my favourite in the film, Rachel Bloom is very good, same with Kelly Clarkson, Jamie Dornan despite how little his presence is, point is everyone does a great job in their voice, even most of them make their characters stand-out, even if some are... ehh....On a side note, the score by Theodore Sharpio who also did the score for Spies in Disguise did the score for this film instead of Christophe Beck from the first film, the score itself is nothing special but it is a good and nice score either way, however people are not interested in that, they want to listen to songs that are the main reason why most people want to see this, well I can say about 50% of them are original, but they are good original song like ""The Other Side"", and ""Just Sing"" are fun, creative, nice to listen to and has great lyrics too!, the rest are just popular and familiar songs that are done in the style of this film, like they use Gangnam Style, Tell Me What You Want, even Rock You Like Hurricane can be very obnoxious and can try too hard to be hip and modern for the kids, I mean these songs aren't even a thing anymore so why bring 'em back?..., I don't know.I didn't think I would say this but, this actually had a bit more effort put in then the first film, but it's still not that good, Trolls: World Tour is far from a DreamWorks classic, but it is slightly better then it had any right to be, the concept is great, it has better comedy, the animation is colourful and full of style, the new characters are incredibly entertaining along with great voice acting and catchy music!, how it can be distracted by the weak story, sometimes it can be a eyesore, along with the characters from the first film generally being bland and a bit annoying, along with cringey moments of pop songs, this is by no means a good movie, however it could of been worse, so I think it's... just okay, it's okay enough to be considered watchable, if your kids are obsessed with Trolls, I think they'll like this as much as the first film, heck even Trolls might like this... or not, who knows?, but it's not really worth the £15 rental, I'd say wait for it to come out on DVD (whenever that is) or if you desperately want to see, then give it a watch, it may be one of the best films of this year, nor worst, at least we got a half-way decent Trolls, hopefully if they don't make a third one..I'm going to give Trolls: World Tour a 6.1/10.",Trolls World Tour
47,CrazyCockatoo2003,The most forgettable movie I have ever seen. .,4,18 April 2020,"In my opinion, this sequel is very forgettable at best when in comparison with Trolls 1, which is slightly better than this movie. The problem with this movie is that they have used so many clichés that it's not even funny. In fact, they used nearly every common cliché you can think of. Furthermore, why is Branch depressed again, and where the hell did DJ Suki go? What I did like about it however, is the impressive animation and the fact that they are diverse to other cultures by having certain music genres from other countries such as Korea, Africa and Scotland. If you are a fan of Trolls, I would recommend it, otherwise it's best not to watch this movie as you might get bored. Personally, I am glad this sequel went straight to digital because of how forgettable it was.",Trolls World Tour

53,andrewtisler,"A good sequel to a fast-paced animated musical, if a little bit less ambitious than its predecessor",8,28 August 2021,"I really like Trolls. It may not be the most flawless animated musical, but it sure is a lot of fun. When I heard that Trolls World Tour was going to be released, I immediately got excited! This is my full honest opinion about the movie: it was a good sequel, but nowhere near as good as the first film's.The story carries on four years after Trolls ended, and follows Poppy and Branch as they find a way to unite the trolls together after the evil Queen Barb of the Hard Rock Trolls attempts to turn every land of music into rock music. During the journey, Poppy begins to understand what true harmony means and uses her newfound knowledge to bring all the trolls together once again. The story is well-written in the sense that it's historically based compared with the first film and has more music to explore, but it's not quite as good as the first movie's. I also love how there's a side plot where Branch tries desperately to confess his feelings of love for Poppy, which is a relatable problem to people with crushes. The humor is good, too.Once again, the animation is nicely-stylized and well-designed. The scrapbook-like texture makes the Trolls universe look colorful and lively, but, as with the first movie, the scenes of animation do slow down at times. I like the different usage of coloring for each kingdom, such as black and red for rock, deep ocean blue for techno, and gold for classical.The soundtrack is full of catchy song with all different sorts of rhythms and beats. Composer Theodore Shapiro and the creative team behind the soundtrack wrote some interesting songs, with my favorites being ""The Other Side"", ""Don't Slack"", ""It's All Love"", and ""Just Sing"". The soundtrack is actually an improvement over the first movie's due to the add-in of more original tracks and not just covers.Overall, Trolls World Tour is not an improvement over the first film, but it is still a fun sequel with colorful animation, a well-told story, and a catchy soundtrack. I just wish the runtime was longer but I also understand why it was so short (because of the COVID-19 pandemic). 8/10.",Trolls World Tour

58,Grojniar,An Outstanding Sequel,10,9 July 2021,"Being a metalhead and a lover of rock I can't help but love Queen Barb, but being someone who cares so much about movies and how they're made I naturally favoured Queen Poppy. I enjoyed most of the songs used but my strong hate towards country made some scenes less enjoyable for me, audibly at least. Just like the first movie the visuals were amazing and very pleasing to look at. To be blunt I absolutely loved it, and it was a great continuation from the first movie, even the credits were enjoyable. As some of you know I love the way romance is depicted in family animations. Since it's never the main point of the story it's always based around the bond between characters as their adventure continues, and seeing how Branches feelings for Poppy carry over into the sequel it was nice seeing him pursue his love for her. Who knows, if they make a third movie we might be lucky enough to see them as new parents. In all honestly I couldn't find a single complaint about the movie and I would actually very much welcome a third for the series. One of the biggest mistakes family animations do is extend a series way longer then it should be extended, but I feel like the Trolls series still has a lot of screen time to give.",Trolls World Tour

Branch and Poppy are trying to bring back pop music in fighting Rachel Bloom character. It has Ozzy Osbourne and Mary J Bluge, of course they put in their two cents. Why some people will hate it. Sam Rockwell plays Hickory in helping Poppy and Branch journey. It starts off Bloom character in kidnapping all the different Trolls in the world and converting them to heavy metal music.

82,Dark-Wolverine,"Colourful,, adventurous and cringy",6,12 April 2020,"Trolls World Tour (2020)Trolls World Tour is the direct sequel to 2016's Trolls and is the first movie of any major studio to get released on the theatres and on digital rental on the same day.In this movie, Queen Barb,who is the queen Hard Rock Trolls is on a quest to collect all the ""six strings of music"" and turn all the six tribes of the trolls into a single tribe and Poppy (Anna Kendrick) and Branch (Justin Timberlake) have to stop them. Unlike the first movie,this is based entirely on Trolls. The animation is amazing and colourful and uses DreamWorks' technique of using different animation styles for a single movie. The characters were good,just like the first film and some characters who had a lesser role in the first have a better role in here. The story is similar to Infinity War and contains all the clichés of any first animated movie sequel. The jokes only land at some points(cringy at many times),the songs aren't as catchy as in the first and are forced and too much at times. It's adventurous and explored more than the first movie did and alot of new concepts were brought in and,it was nice. The 3rd act was better actually and they did convey a good meaning in a good way.I recommend this movies to those who are the fans of Trolls(2016) or a DreamWorks fan or those who have nothing else in mind to watch for now, it's mostly harmless.Rating: 6/10",Trolls World Tour
83,jesusfreak-00881,I'm so bummed,5,15 September 2020,"I wanted this to be cute like the first film, but it just didn't quite cut it. First, if you're going to have rock music, have a rock musician be Barb. There's nothing wrong with Rachel Bloom, but she can't sing Ozzy Osborne or Heart songs. She doesn't have the power. Get someone who can.
Next, I hated that the final song was pop. Pop fixes everything? I thought pop was the problem? It felt very inconsistent.
Finally, why have Branch have a moment saying all music needs to survive and do something about it if he's just going to fail the moment he shows up so Poppy can save the day? Let Branch save the day - he's the one doing the work.All in all it was...fine...and the message of being different was actually super timely, but the story fell flat in ways that just can't be forgiven.

When I'm going to bedroom, I hide and wearing my dad's swim shirt. I kinda look like I dressed up as Billie Eilish (or not) and wearing sunglasses. My family never heard of Billie Eilish because they haven't seen her and she is 18. Why would my dad want to watch Trolls. He decided switched to Despicable Me 2 and Trolls is too Annoying for me and Nadia C especially sensitive people. However some sensitive people might be scared.

And to be honest, that was the only thrilling thing about the movie. The story was a bit dull and boring, you knew what was going to happen from miles away. The same thing has been done thousands of times in other movies (but with other items instead of music strings). The excitement doesn't come from the story or the animations, it's in listening to the songs you're familiar with being visualized by trolls. I guess thats what saves this movie just like the last time, and thats also why i give it a 6 because it's still enjoyable. Don't expect anything more than just an enjoyable movie (or should i say musical).",Trolls World Tour
86,elizy-33092,Those who didn't understand the moral weren't paying attention,9,28 June 2020,"This movie, in my opinion, was better than the first one. My siblings liked it, and even I thought it was decent.
At first, Poppy preaches about how every troll from every kingdom is all in all ""the same"" until she meets the funk king and queen, who explains that denying their differences is part of the problem. They say that what they need to do is accept each other's differences (for their case, music genres) rather than act as though we're exactly, because it only strips people of their identity. Everyone should listen to each other and learn to be more open minded and tolerant towards each other. I read a review that said that the moral was ""confusing"" due to what Poppy was preaching at the beginning about everyone being the same, despite funk kind and queen clearly changing her mind. I don't understand how, because it was quite obvious to me. It had a meaningful moral, and I feel that it can apply to real life.
I do have some complaints. The representation of each genre kingdom and their music was highly disproportionate, even with the major genre kingdoms who had their strings. The rock kingdom only had like 3 songs (and were old 70s songs that most young kids watching this won't recognize), country had 2, techno had one, funk had I think two, classical had one, and pop had more than I can count. It just comes off as a bit bias. Also, for a movie that's supposed to have a meaning, there was too much/many glitter, colors, random in your face humor, etc. which can turn people off and make them want to turn away.",Trolls World Tour
87,ethanj-41027,Corporate Capitalism at its Finest,5,19 May 2020,"Trolls World Tour (2020) - [5/10]Oh my, oh my. I'm going to keep this one short - just like this film's runtime. Trolls World Tour (2020) is a film for a certain demographic, just one demographic, and if you don't fall under that category, you will not enjoy this film. If you're not a child under eight, I wouldn't advise watching this (I was going to give this film a 4/10, because my total score was a 36%, but I took into consideration the age that this film tries to appeal. If I was in that demographic, I would have probably enjoyed this film, so I added a little bit of leeway in that respect). It treats the viewer as if they are completely oblivious to any sort of subtlety, so the filmmakers have their characters explain multiple times the same piece of exposition and every other story element. It is like the filmmakers think we need to be spoon fed every piece of the story. Granted this may be because many members of the target audience are still being spoon fed their meals, but you would expect the film to at least respect the older audience that might watch this too. The story is filled with numerous plot holes, predictability, and unoriginal ideas (don't even get me started with the amount of story elements that were stolen from films like Avengers: Infinity War (2018) ). It's like the story was built around each of the 20 original songs and cover songs, so the film feels like an endless music video. If anything, this film represents corporate capitalism at its finest - they created an unnecessary sequel to sell songs. Those songs are one of the only redeeming qualities this film has (and the best ones are the original songs - not the cover songs. The covers are really quite bad). So, one of the best things about the film is the soundtrack, but the best thing about the soundtrack are the songs that are unattached to the film - quite interesting. The other redeeming quality is the animation. It's quite spectacular in most scenes, but the amount of color and ""seizure-inducing"" visuals make for an overwhelming experience. I think Trolls World Tour (2020) is a great example that visual style cannot make up for any amount of story substance a film is lacking. Overall, Trolls World Tour (2020) is pretty mediocre. If it didn't have the 20 songs in the soundtrack, it would have nothing. If it didn't have beautiful animation, it would be completely unoriginal. If it treated its audience members better, it would be much more enjoyable. I'm sure kids that are in its target demographic will enjoy Trolls World Tour (2020), but if you aren't in that age range... proceed with caution.",Trolls World Tour

The morals are all over the place, the heroine is more of a brat than ever and the stereotype of the other music genres are just insulting to each genre besides pop. The music chosen for each genre is also not representative for the different genres and who thought casting Rachel Bloom would be a brilliant idea for the second lead as Rock princes when all she seemed to have done are pop-parodies. I can't say anything about her acting qualities but she is not convincing as the queen of metal, rock or even pop-rock. The songs for each other genre then pop where butchers and instead of showing how beautiful all the different styles, cultures and people are, they made it sound sooo much alike. I'm more then disappointed.",Trolls World Tour

1) I really enjoyed the dive into different genres that the movie took.
2) The bright colors and great graphics pulled me into the film really well visually. I'm sure kids will love this movie.
3) There were some hilarious moments towards the beginning.Cons: There really wasn't great writing, and some disappointing character animation.
1) The character relationship arcs were cliché and overly predictable. It got pretty boring during the last 10 minutes.
2) The other genres of music are not well represented.
Classical Trolls all look exactly the same.K-Pop Trolls are introduced as being separate from pop, but they have about 10 seconds of singing (along with a few other genres, but the trailer made K-Pop seem like it was going to be a bigger deal).AND the Pop Trolls song a K-POP song in the middle of a medley, which makes the way the K-Pop Trolls get introduced to the Pop Trolls feel like a plot hole.3) Several songs have characters singing, but no character mouths moving. It completely took me out of the story.",Trolls World Tour
121,chrisbloggerg,I was more interested in a phone call than this,4,24 June 2021,"Trolls World Tour (Short Review)
1.5/4Trolls World Tour is desperate but failed attempt at expanding the original Trolls, with an extremely unoriginal and predictable plot spoofing Endgame, badly picked and stolen songs and characters that will irritate you even more than Willy Wonka's (2005) Oompa-Loompas.While I did get to slightly enjoy some visuals and messages, much of the plot made me dizzy and confused, not knowing where any of the characters were. I feel this is just a botched up work that serves as an attempt to moneymaking, but it failed.Speaking about positive messages and characters, while the first Trolls had tolerably interesting characters and a clear message, this sequel led me to wonder, what was the message they were trying to convey? Why do the characters act like a chip off the old block?After being forced to rewatch this again, someone made a random phone call to one of my house members. I felt more interested in the phone call than this.Overall, Trolls World Tour is pretty much unwatchable except to children who may find the 'animation' fun to watch. Other than that, I really love movies and rarely rate movies 1.5/4 or below. In the event you do see one of these reviews, you can just skip this movie.",Trolls World Tour

And everybody loved it!! The kids laughed out loud throughout and were so engrossed they didn't even nag for extra snacks! Haha.

I enjoyed the message, and it even swung back and forth on it as if the view was maturing throughout the movie. The original song in the middle was the best on the movie, and almost seemed like intended irony. All of the Rock songs were poorly done, and the other covers weren't great. The movie would have been so much better of they'd gotten Lzzy Hale from Halestorm to play Queen Barb.",Trolls World Tour

125,mail-95391,Great film to teach kids about different types of music,8,3 May 2020,"Trolls world tour is a fantastic movie. And I'm surprised to be saying that as I mainly watched trolls World Tour, because of its incredible historical significance as the movie that broke movie theaters. I don't know if many of you are aware, but Universal Pictures decided to release trolls World Tour directly to streaming bypassing the theaters, for the first time in history, duuuu dooo daaaa. Even now, amc movie theaters is boycotting Universal Pictures and refusing to carry any of their films as universal enjoyed great success with this strategy and doesn't have to share the hundred million dollars they made on trolls World Tour with anybody.But back to the movie itself. The movie is a delightful children's film about different types of music, and how they can all work together in the end, from rock to pop to classical to funk to rock to... that's about it. but all the different styles of music, a little bit of reggae a little bit of Kpop, some smooth jazz (normal jazz seems to be ignored entirely,
I guess funk is part of jazz). Anyway all of these different types of music come together in a beautiful story that I think will teach kids about the importance of listening to different types of music. This is a great lesson and a valuable kids movie. Great songs for adults who will recognize a lot of them. Kids will find them all to be brand new, especially the ones where they change the words.Enjoy trolls World Tour! It's a great movie, almost like a music video. And the animation looks great. Thanks so much for reading this review, I hope you like it.",Trolls World Tour

127,ace_spades420,"Boring, predictable, and a waste of money",3,13 April 2020,"The most accurate review I have is you need to be high to watch this movie. It feels like the script was written over a weekend. The movie is just weird in moments and not in a good way like the first one. It lacks the humorous contrast between poppy and branch that made the first movie work. This movie just tried too hard to be something. The overall message of the movie is good, but the execution is terrible.",Trolls World Tour

In this one, his hair is Navy blue/black. It changed once, when they did their Country scene. I HATE when they change the looks of characters. The songs were good, to me. But when Poppy finds out about Pop trolls taking the Funk trolls string (or whatever it was), they never sort of tied those strings up, no exploration of that event etc.",Trolls World Tour

138,ertoth,Not the best sequel,6,19 April 2020,"Confused & low narrative. A somewhat try-to-be sequel that fails carrying through its, some might say, mission. Stereotypical take on genres and very pretentious notion of hate towards pop culture.
Though it has some smart takes on culture appropriation, colonialism and history revisionism (through colorful but real parallels to pop music in recent times), it feels at moments much more then a children's film and a lot of fun.
however, still the narrative has holes, the delivery could be better & the rock could be presented much 'harder', although some smart takes were already used in the first.
You should watch it with your kids, also from the perspective of music genre education, but also to apprechiate more the first one.",Trolls World Tour

I'm a sucker for juke-box musicals and thought the Rock Troll, Queen Barb/ Rachel Bloom, was fabulous!Messages in movies are such common cliches I ride over them and try to enjoy the view.Seeing girl-lead Poppy make mistake after mistake was a nice break from the 'strong-role-model' types. Females are people just as capable of being reckless but it's difficult for female characters because of double-standards.I like a lot about this movie, but can admit it's silly and not for everyone.

144,adam3296-21-766608,Pretty disappointing sequel,5,12 April 2020,We've watched the first Trolls movie countless times. This movie is not a worthy successor. It's trying to do way too much in a 94 minute movie. It requires more than one viewing to totally understand. It has the same theme as the first movie: We're all different and yet we're all the same. And worst of all the music isn't as memorable as it was the first film. I just finished the movie an hour ago and I can't remember what songs were in it. Just wait and watch this when it's free. Go back and watch the first Trolls movie instead.,Trolls World Tour
145,tillman-89878,A complete mess,1,12 April 2020,"This film is just a colourful incoherent mess.We were big fans of the first film in our house and have watched it numerous times. So when we heard there was going to be a sequel we knew we'd be heading to the cinema. Alas that was not to be, so when it was announced the film would be avaliable to rent via streaming we decided to rent it on Easter Sunday. I'm thankful that I didn't have to trek to the cinema to watch it but annoyed that I paid over £16 to watch it in the comfort of my own house.The first film had character and charm, catchy songs, and a decent story that conveyed an important message. This film has none of the above. The storyboard consisted of nothing more than someone throwing an obscene amount of glitter at it and then craming as many songs as possible into it. And none of the songs were 'Get Back Up Again' standout.Clearly the scriptwriters couldn't agree on whether Poppy was right all along or wrong all along as both are confirmed to be true. They then decided to tack a 'music comes from within' message to the end as an afterthought copying the 'happiness comes from within' one of the first film.Obviously I don't expect an Oscar worthy movie from a Trolls film and there's always an element of copy and pasting the formula of the first film with sequels. But this film just missed the beat everytime. For example they reused the character pooping confectionary from the first film but completely omit the Bergen which is criminal.If I could give a minus score I would.",Trolls World Tour

To see them pump out films such as Trolls: World Tour makes me sad. At their height, they could rival Pixar in quality, but in 2020, while Pixar was releasing Onward (their best film in years, I might add), Dreamworks has released a sequel to one of their most cookie cutter films. And it's worse than the first one.I have a lot of issues with Trolls: World Tour, but it really boils down to the thinly veiled message and the different music ""generes,"" which are all slightly different flavors of pop (the country trolls, in my opinion, being the biggest offenders). The message of the film is the same as any other children's film, which is fine, but the way they went about it seemed to insult the audience. I know I'm not the target audience, but it should at least be entertaining to older folks, and this film only manages to be mildly disappointing. I would certainly never watch it again.I hope Dreamworks can find their footing, but it seems they have stopped trying to compete with Pixar, and resigned to simply becoming a shadow of their former selves.",Trolls World Tour

184,welzifc,Don't buy the hype,3,23 July 2020,Was it a bad movie? No. However it's not worth full price. If you find it on RedBox watch it there. Personally I liked the 1st one better because the covers it had. The 2nd one is a bunch of originals mixed with some covers. Though the originals are not BAD it's not what I wanted to hear. Pair that with a story that is sort of all over the place it just feels like more could have been done.,Trolls World Tour

Sam RockwellOFFICIAL SYNOPSIS:
""Poppy and Branch discover that there are six different troll tribes scattered over six different lands. Each tribe is also devoted to six different kinds of music -- funk, country, techno, classical, pop and rock. When rockers Queen Barb and King Thrash set out to destroy the other music, Poppy and Branch embark on a daring mission to unite the trolls and save the diverse melodies from becoming extinct.""Trolls: World Tour is a 2020 film directed by Walt Dohrn and creatively supervised by DreamWorks animation. The film was released on VOD and a few theatres on April 10, 2020. Although the film has strong behind the scenes talent to support it, I still was quite disappointed after completing my notes. I elaborate further in the following review:Trolls: World Tour is a visual stunner (Obviously), and lives up to the standards of DreamWorks. However, creatively and emotionally, DreamWorks did not tap into the full potential of the film. The Background score is 'eh'. It isn't exciting or adventurous as it should be. After all, Poppy and Brad are going on a GLOBAL adventure, as the title of the film suggests. Instead, the BGM was bland and ridiculously simplistic.I also do have some issues with the writing. I feel that in some moments, the comedy is forced, and not brought in, in a natural way like how Thor: Ragnarok and Frozen II did. In the scenes where there were really HIGH stakes, the dialogue was unrealistic, and the characters didn't necessarily seem too concerned (except for the ending of the movie). I think that next time, if they do a Trolls 3, DreamWorks should consider hiring Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers, or Taika Waititi.Speaking of the ending, the film is way too rushed. From the start to the end, everything is done quick, not giving enough time for one scene to develop (although that is a positive element in other films). Its especially apparent at the beginning, involving the Techno Trolls and Barb. If you're gonna have a film with a massive amount of lead characters, try and find people who have had experience handling ensemble films (Like Joe and Anthony Russo).Overall, your kids will love Trolls: World Tour. But if you really think about it hard, its a big disappointment and could have been so much more. Judging by the marketing, I thought that this film learned from the mistakes of the first, but I was wrong. Don't expect too much from this film.I give this film a 4/10",Trolls World Tour
186,jocampion,Meh,3,27 December 2020,"Really enjoyed the first trolls 1 with my 4 year old daughter, but the second was a bit meh. Think they missed the mark a bit with the choice of 'rock' music for a younger audience as it's all from 70s/80s, which I found strange as the other genre songs were all more current. Wouldn't pay to watch this movie, was free on sky and I'd have been annoyed if I paid. Lots of the characters from the 1st film aren't in this either which is a shame.",Trolls World Tour
187,akirnic,Rooting for the bad guys.,1,6 March 2021,"Never in my life have i wanted the bad guys destroy the other annoying trolls. Still watching it just because i happen to push play button.Do yourself a favor, skip this one..",Trolls World Tour

The story is cute and fun. The message is really good and relevant for today.Highly recommended if you'd just like to have a good time and relax. Don't listen to trolls (that are not form this movie :P)",Trolls World Tour
190,sara-asadi01,Perfect combination of music,10,7 September 2020,Loved the concept of all of us together and yet we have our individuality. Can't wait to see the next trolls with introduction of music from different countries.,Trolls World Tour
191,ameliattack,Not As Good As the First,6,11 April 2020,"The soundtrack is amazing, most of the new characters are fun, and there were some storyline points that genuinely moved me and made me cry. But it's like the editor got drunk and decided to have some fun...it felt ALL OVER THE PLACE and there were little tiny details that distracted and made it feel confusing and messy. The characters weren't as endearing this time around, the Bergens were missed, and at certain points the animation styles didn't match up with each other. Could have been great if it wasn't so sloppy.",Trolls World Tour
192,thynxink,Everything corny you'd hate to watch,4,11 April 2020,I get the premis of the movie but the execution was poor. Super annoying tbh.,Trolls World Tour
193,bryon_goff,Meh...,5,18 April 2020,"Boring, unfunny, and a weak plot. Also, it ripped off major aspects from Lord of the Rings and Infinity War.",Trolls World Tour
194,broadwaypizano,A genuinely great animated film,8,13 April 2020,"When my friends and I decided to watch this movie on a whim (via Zoom) because it had the Mcelroy brothers in it, I thought it was going to be another mediocre, not very funny for adults, children's movie, with no real substance. I was wrong.
First of all, as a student studying 3D animation, this film is freakin' gorgeous to look at. I was delighted by the visual aesthetics, animation, and texture / particle work.
As for the actual movie: It's funny! Yes, is some of it kind of cringe-y because it's a jukebox musical rethemed to put the word ""trolls"" in things? Yes, but if you let that stop you from having fun, you're a coward. The story is fun! The worlds that get explored are fun! And, best of all, the message of the film actually has teeth - no ""just be nice"" fluff in Trolls:World Tour, no, you get a child-friendly discussion of historical revisionism and the appropriation of other cultures. I was pleasantly surprised by it.",Trolls World Tour
195,mattbottomley,Excruciatingly bad,2,24 May 2020,I liked the original trolls movie. So did my children. Unfortunately 5 minutes in the child my girlfriend and I were watching with disappeared as something frightened her. We were left watching the remaining 1 hour 25 minutes alone. As we paid £14 we were inclined to press on and get our money's worth. I soon reached for the wine in an attempt to add entertainment to a paint by numbers plot and irritating and repetitive songs. This almost ruins the first film. Why not stick to creating original IP rather than roll out tired and predictable sequels. Avoid,Trolls World Tour
196,jennymariesanchez,My kids LOVED it!,9,11 April 2020,"This movie is great. The music is fantastic. It's funny. And my kids loved it. My daughter has watched it 5 times today (don't judge... quarantine). My son, who is 2 years old, when there is an emotional part at the end, my son quickly puts his hand up to the corner of his eye, as if to wipe a tear. And then he starts hitting his forehead. I said, ""Oh buddy! Do you feel feelings?"" He responds, ""No. No. No. No!"" So, it moved my 2 year old to tears and my 6 year old already has the songs memorized!",Trolls World Tour
197,ericcawhitley,Can't make it,1,2 May 2020,"We're watching it now and it's hard to follow. It seems really rushed and nothing makes any sense. Poppy is extremely annoying and naive it's hard to keep watching. The first movie was great with a great storyline and message, this one just seems like a joke that's not even funny.",Trolls World Tour
198,larosamarilla,It was pretty great,9,19 July 2021,"Because we need colors and rhythm in our lives, no matter who we are, we need this kind of cute movies. I'm surprised by the bad reviews and comments about this movie, I've finally watched it and loved it. I can understand that every one has a different taste, but really it was pretty good for me.This movie was as great as the first one with its own differences. It was completely ok that they followed a new storyline because changing and bringing new details and vibes is better then repeating the same story over and over.All the new details were still exiting, colors, music, all the characters, the voice actings, every thing. And if you pay attention carefully, at the end, you'll realize the message.Our world is pretty crazy this days and watching an animation like this makes me feel and think that maybe we can change the craziness with more love and comprehension as it was shown in the movie.",Trolls World Tour
199,monosolo-57207,Perfect with magic shrooms,10,23 August 2020,"Took shrooms in the cinema for Trolls 1, it was the best trip I ever had.Today just did the same for the World Tour, amazing!DONT WATCH IT WITHOUT SHROOM! It's made for shrooms:)",Trolls World Tour

It brings me into totally different world which is way too colorful and amazing. Concept of story is really great and one great lesson it teaches to current real life world that being different unity makes us stronger.,Trolls World Tour

203,jamesthegamemaster,Talk about Trolls passion,10,17 March 2020,"The first movie was seen as very divisive and tons of people hated it. While the story for the first film was simple, the jokes were hit or miss, and the emotion could either be seen as emotional or not, depending on how people interpreted it, Trolls: World Tour cranked it up a million notches. World Tour includes humor that's bound to get a laugh out of somebody because the humor is entirely inspired by each of the characters strengths. The animation is beautiful, it's very fluid and smooth as well as colorful. The characters had some strong development. While Barb could've had a stronger reason as to why she does what she does, her reasons are understandable. Branch has some of the best development I've seen in a long time. I would love to see more from Poppy and Branch in the future with what this movie gave. Each of the artists were cast perfectly, even though Ozzy Osborne and J Balvin were given a little less screen time & lines than I thought. The message is amazing because not only is it relevant, but it's a stronger message indicating that we should accept differences, not unite everyone by commonality. The only real thing I didn't like about Trolls: World Tour is the pacing. Because it's 1 hour and 35 minutes, everything goes by at rapid speeds without letting the emotional moments really settle in and leave an impact on the audience experiencing the feels right along with the characters. While Trolls: World Tour isn't a perfect movie and could be better, it's an amazing movie and is a perfect step up for the trolls franchise & should hopefully allow some people to give the Trolls franchise a second chance.",Trolls World Tour
204,yoelstillmee,It's a creative imagination about trolls & the world of music.,9,10 June 2020,"I always love how Trolls make me excited and comfort me. The imaginations and ideas for this film are nice. It's clever to put the music world 'together' in this film about Trolls. This one is lovely, how we can various Trolls with their own uniqueness in music, I love it.The quality of animation is good as always, beautifully made with colorful colors. The new characters are fresh. The story plot is interesting. The prolog is not bad and the ending is cool.",Trolls World Tour

206,michael_cervantes,Cloud Guy role was underdeveloped for Trolls 2,8,21 June 2020,"Hello, love those musical trolls!
I do however think that the Cloud Guy role was underdeveloped, which is strange as he appears to have been the most informed of all the characters. The day of Trollstice when all the trolls took to the tunnels, risking their lives to save themselves could have explained the separation of the troll tribes (via the tunnels), and why they were kept apart so long for fear of being found by the Bergens.
Cloud guy could have revealed the secret he was holding (possibly by request of the Pop Troll King) and that might explain how Cooper knew about his uncle who hurt himself dancing.Of course, that would have gone against the ""No Troll Left Behind"" endeavor.",Trolls World Tour

208,carlover-10179,So political,2,27 April 2020,Tired of all kids movies becoming political pieces now. The movie was obviously hinting at how whites are responsible for everything wrong in history and how they need to step away and let minorities rule everything. An annoying message displayed in many movies. We are all equal and we are the same. We can acknowledge each others differences but we don't need to use them to blame others for oppression when in many cases that oppression does not exist.,Trolls World Tour
209,shazaruljumin,Awesome movie,10,17 June 2020,"The movie is awesome. I like the music,the character are all cute and the graphic are so colorful I really like it.The story about adventure to save music is great I like it. I also have a few suggestion.. what if poppy go another adventure to find her mom. Example her mom is going to find a place so the trolls can live and escape from the bergan town because the bergan want to eat them so they can feel happy right.So after poppy mom find a place for the trolls to live she never come back.I think she could be lost in the woods or maybe been kidnap.second suggestion is poppy mom and peppy(poppy father) had a fight and poppy mom run away and never come backthirt suggestion is that branch try to find his parents.On the first movie trolls he live with his grandma only. So what about branch try to find his parents.",Trolls World Tour

211,jpwhitt-55569,Typical Liberal Propaganda,5,13 April 2020,As would be expected this is all about diversity and inclusion. The Rock Trolls seem to represent white people who want to eliminate all other races and make everyone just like them. So obvious just wish Hollywood would just go back to entertainment instead of indoctrination. Ugh.,Trolls World Tour
212,jamesbeatty,A missed opportunity to do so much more,2,27 September 2020,"What a waste. The first film was one of the best musicals of the last ten years, which my whole family have enjoyed over and over again. We were really looking forward to the sequel, so much so that we even paid to stream it.Imagine someone bakes you a cake, and it's delicious! Looks great, slightly crispy on the outside and perfectly soft in the middle with a chocolate cream filling that's just right. You eat it up and tell the Baker it was marvelous, oh and you loved the icing. The Baker listens to this and makes you another, only this time you bite into and it's 100% icing! With glitter! Yeuch!That's how this film felt, a great big bowl of icing with nothing to hold it all together. The songs were instantly forgettable, some of the featured genres were basically ignored and at the end of the film somehow, inexplicably, the world is united under yet another tedious pop song.Major disappoint from people we know are capable of so much better.",Trolls World Tour
213,brookedef,AMAZING!!!!,10,16 March 2020,"Trolls world tour was 10x better than the first and Branch is such a cutie!!!!! I couldn't think of a better plot!!!!! I just hope we get a trolls 3 and we get even more cutsie moments between Branch and Poppy, for example; them kissing, Branch giving Poppy a piggyback, them flirting etc!.. the one and only thing this movie was missing was the Broppy kiss (but maybe that part was just taken out of some countries, who knows) .. other than that I recommend it to everyone and anyone! And I can't wait to see what the future holds for trolls 3!!!",Trolls World Tour
214,leahbarker-29426,Terrible,3,19 April 2020,We were looking forward to this movie. But it was terrible. Someone was on drugs making this movie. Very weird. All 4 of our kids did not like it. Ranging from ages 8-14. Waste of time and money.,Trolls World Tour
215,kiyamurph,People need to calm down,9,15 May 2020,"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I don't get all of the super low ratings. This movie is clearly for children. My 3 and 6 year olds love this movie and my 3 year old asks for it all of the time. It kept their interest the whole time and they love to get up and dance during some of the numbers. It has a great message of valuing the differences of others and I'm not sure why other reviewers were confused by this. There are a few reviewers that even called this movie ""left wing propaganda""...what in the world? Respecting differences and other people's opinions even when you don't agree isn't political; it's life. Not everyone will agree with you and like it or not, we are all different. I think some of these reviewers need some introspection. All in all, this is a movie that was enjoyed by all and it keeps my kids entertained during these crazy times.",Trolls World Tour

223,lbrewer-54243,Forgot the fun...,6,11 April 2020,"What should have been a fun romp of trolls through various styles of music ended up being a little bland. There is some genuinely good (older) music in there but the new original songs are not really worth remembering. It's funny in a few places but just kind of rolls along from the half point to the end with a not all that fun of an ending.
I think if it had focused more on the fun and less on the ""make a point about how everyone is equal"" it would have been a much better movie.
In my opinion, they really wasted the ""different music"" troll ideas. They talk so much about how every music is good but when they travel to each world, the songs are poorly picked (with the exception of the rock trolls.) Country Land... what a great opportunity to show country trolls having fun with their own music. But instead, they sing a slow country song that Poppy and friends both say ""sounds so sad"". Classical Land? You barely hear any classical music.
Finally, (SLIGHT SPOILER) when they all unite at the end of the movie, they have an OK song that just sounds mostly like Pop Land. What a wasted opportunity. They could have made a small melody that is copied across all genres of music, each showing unique ways to emphasize the melody.
(SPOILER)
HERE'S A BETTER IDEA! At one point at the end, after they've all lost the music, one of the trolls has a heart beat and they realize they are all the same. :(
They SHOULD have had that heart beat get stronger across all trolls and say ""the one thing that unites us is the BEAT!"" Using that same beat across all types of music while showing it pulsing in their chests would have been amazing.",Trolls World Tour

From Hammer Time to Heart, Beethoven to Black Sabbath, and Daft Punk to Scorpions.

I enjoyed all the songs and found the character designs fantastic. There are many epic comedic moments in the movie. The animation is breath-taking, (I'm sure everyone agrees on that), and to me and my family, the story and was beautifully put together. I found the first movie a bit too childish for me, but this is an awesome step up. I love all the characters, specially Barb and Branch. All these insanely low ratings must be from people that didn't even watch the movie.

250,joanne-fellows,Hated it at first now I love it,9,12 April 2020,"Maybe it's because I have a 2 and 4 year old and have now watched this 17 times (at least) but this film is definitely a grower. I love the first film and on first watching I thought this was awful but now I think it's great, funny, great soundtrack, fab characters. A lockdown must!",Trolls World Tour

252,erinjane12,Great family movie,10,12 April 2020,Funny and fun to dance to! It was great and we love it! It was amazing! My son made me write a review as soon as we finished!,Trolls World Tour
253,shelton1975,The perfect tonic,10,7 April 2020,"Watching with my wife and six year old. We all loved it. It is a visual feast. Colourful, musical and a good amount of humour without being over the top. Although you can predict the end from a mile away, it still tugs the heart strings (no pun intended) a little. The music is well placed and catchy.If you don't like this film, remember it was made primarily for children. But as parents we loved it and watching our daughter sing along with the most massive smile on her face, just about sums it up.Enjoy",Trolls World Tour
254,mr_dylan_brown,Such a wasted premise,1,5 July 2020,"I was so excited to watch this one with my kids. The first movie had a pretty good plot, likeable characters, and some good songs. All of this combined with the premise of different genre music trolls sounded pretty cool.But the plot is convoluted and moves and breakneck speed. Queen Barb is annoying and the music is just one long mashup with no actual songs.Also, when I think of a female singer to introduce the country trolls I think Reba or Dolly Parton. Nope they used Kelly Clarkson. All of the genres are Pop doing an imitation of it.",Trolls World Tour
255,evdog3000,Ordinary At Best,2,3 January 2021,The plot was all over the place with random characters popping up. The songs weren't even that great in comparison to the first movie. All in all a big let down.,Trolls World Tour

262,brittnie-alexandria09,Trash,1,19 April 2020,"What on Earth was this?
I watched the first Trolls with my son and was taken aback by the quality of story and music they had for the first one. The arrangement for ""Sound of Silence"" was so surprisingly good it made me misty eyed... The music in this sequel is beyond subpar... The continuity is confusing and has nothing to do with the first movie, to the point that I'm literally lost how the first one could have happened in this Troll universe. Honestly, I am not surprised on how dumbed down this movie was. Also- the movie says ""different music for each land"", yeah, it's all pop. Don't waste your time.",Trolls World Tour
263,ivkmaganito,TROLLS: World Tour is <3,9,6 April 2020,"With all that's happening in the world right now, this movie is perfect. I liked the first Trolls movie, but I LOVEEEEE this one!! I love animation movies in general but this franchise is definitely some of my favorites. I think I may be a bit biased because I love both Anna Kendrick and JT, and their friendship offscreen too. But one thing I didn't like as is the fact that Anna's vocals are still not as featured in the soundtrack, even though she is the lead character.",Trolls World Tour
264,etiennetanti,Great movie to watch,9,8 May 2020,"Great movie to watch with all the family
Great music good vibe
My 4 year old twins love it",Trolls World Tour
265,macoulston,A good idea that just doesn't connect,7,3 August 2021,"The movie starts with Branch having gone back from where they had finished in the last movie and moves from there. They have a great idea with the different trolls and the representation of different music styles, it does have a few cringe worthy moments (such as the pop medly in the country area) and a few moments where it slips from teen to young child area but all in all they pull it together to get a good meaning across.The reason I rated it a 7 rather than any higher though was because it felt like they were building to something with branch liking multiple different types of music and coming in with the others at the end to save the day, then they just kind of leave him hanging in order for Poppy to finish the movie in what feels like a very shoe horned in ending that kind of leaves off in a very similar area to where the original trolls movie ended emotionally but instead of feeling finished it just feels more like it is repeating now.",Trolls World Tour

270,cardica,Loved it!,10,3 May 2020,There was definitely a lot going on in the movie so it can be easy to lose attention from it. The music is phenomenal and I love the humor!

271,aliciadenise,Love the movie,10,5 July 2020,"My daughter loves the movie so much she watches it at least once a day sometimes two. Only thing that irritates me is leave it to my child to fall in love with the hardest to find character, Hickory. Even king trollex that was in it all of 5 seconds is easier to find than Hickory who has a much bigger part",Trolls World Tour

The story was good, music was great, and the animation was wonderful!

273,raycantley,Worst movie I've seen in a really long time.,1,12 April 2020,The whole movie was like a bad dream. Such a shame the first movie was great. Don't ruin it by watching the second movie.,Trolls World Tour
274,kls-81796,The McElroy Brothers are in it; a Trolls World Tour review,10,16 April 2020,"In what critics are calling a ""blink and you'll miss it performance"" Justin, Travis, and Griffin McElroy dazzle audiences as Skyscraper Troll. The brothers 3, hosts of the aptly named podcast, ""My Brother My Brother and Me"", successfully trolled their way into Trolls World Tour. The entire saga is documented in the prestige podcast, ""The McElroy Brothers Will Be in Trolls World Tour"", which my wife describes as ""kinda dumb"". Co-Starring alongside the brothers, Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake reprise their roles as Queen Poppy and Branch. Other notable cast include Sam Rockwell as Hickory, Kelly Clarkson as Delta Dawn and Kynal Nayyar as Guy Diamond. Oh, and also the Prince of Darkness himself, Ozzie Osborne! There are no stars in the sky anymore, they are all in this movie!Spoilers Ahead:
Trolls World your is a delightful story about the power of music and how our differences make us unique and should be celebrated! This powerful message is underscored by a soundtrack that is pure fire! Daft Punk's ""One More Time"" starts the movie strong... oh boy, when that beat drops! Pure joy! Moving through many western musical genres, pop, country, techno, funk, and Rock and Roll, each and every song in this movie is a club banger!Queen Poppy learns that her kingdom, the Pop Trolls, is only one of 6 Troll kingdom, and each is in possession of a magical string from a lute that when united can create an instrument of unimaginable power... this is totally not a rip-off of the MCU Infinity Saga. Barb, queen of the Rock Trolls is gathering the strings so that she can play the most epic power chord in history, which will turn all the other trolls into (dust) Rock Zombies.Poppy and Branch, along with Biggie (James Cordon - how does this guy keep getting work?!) embark on a quest to stop Barb through the power of pop music and hugs. There are a lot of fun twists and turns on the journey, which I won't spoil here, but I do want to talk about the part of the movie that really stuck with me. I still don't know if it was poignant or just heavy handed, but it was powerful. When Poppy and Branch discover the Funk Trolls, Queen Essence (Mary J. Blige) tells Poppy, ""Pop tried to destroy our music."" This movie does not shy away from difficult subject matter and in my opinion, handles it really well. Poppy turns to the Queen and says that that is not what she read in her scrapbooks. The response that followed is what got me... ""Scrapbooks? Those are cut out, glued and glittered by the winners. Let me tell you how it really went down.""Prince D, the Hip Hop Troll shows Poppy how pop music tried to take over all the other music genres in the past. This mirrors the very real history of pop music. There are powerful and sensitive sociological and racial realities that are being not-so-subtly referenced here. Many others have written more eloquently than I ever could on the subject but suffice it to say, I was not expecting this children's movie to speak so candidly about such a complex subject... And DreamWorks did not miss a beat. It was so well handled.Poppy, when confronted with new information from a respectable source, actually took the information and changed her way of thinking. This is another thing I appreciated seeing and did not expect from the studio that brought us The Minions Movie. Poppy began the movie believing that all Trolls are the same. Sure there are little differences, but deep down, we're all the same. We're people, er, Trolls after all. This sentiment is prevalent in society today. It is a sentiment that is usually well meaning but is also flawed. King Quincy of the Funk Trolls says it best, ""denying our differences is denying the truth of who we are"".Poppy ties a beautiful bow on the movie by saying ""You have to be able to listen to other voices, even when they don't agree with you. They make us stronger, more creative, more inspired. So whether your song is sad and heartfelt, loud and defiant, or warm and funky, or even if you're a little bit of each, it's all these sounds, and all our differences that make the world a richer place. Because you can't harmonize alone.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, 5 out of 5 Hair tufts, would watch again. I have been eagerly awaiting this movie since the first episode of ""The McElroy Brothers Will Be In Trolls World Tour"" long before the movie was even announced. This movie deftly and unflinchingly addresses complicated subject matter in a way that respects the intelligence of the audience, even if that audiences is largely 8 year olds. Even on the subject of friendship, this movie pulls no punches. Barb, queen of the Rock Trolls says, ""Friendship takes time and years of mutual care and respect. You don't just become best friends"". The animation is beautiful, which is not unexpected from DreamWorks (though we should never forgive them for the visual dumpster fire that was Shark Tale). Trolls World Tour is also genuinely funny. This visually stunning movie is stuffed with sight gags. Combine what with the comedic talent of the cast (and also James Cordon, I guess) and you'll be laughing for 90 minutes straight! I highly recommend this movie and I highly recommend that you listen to any of the McElroy Podcasts!",Trolls World Tour
275,curtisa-71813,Great Movie,10,11 April 2020,Our kids really loved it!! We really enjoyed it as well. It has a great message.,Trolls World Tour
276,michaelkemp-93169,Mixed messages,5,12 April 2020,"This movie cannot decide if it wants to support individuality or group mentality. Early on there is a lesson about people being people no matter who or what they are. Then halfway through it explains the dangers of homogeneity. By the end, it tried to teach the old separate but equal thinking. I know it's a movie made for children, but there was no clear message. My 8 year old daughter asked me what the moral of the movie was, and I didnt know what to tell her.",Trolls World Tour
277,aidenrush,GARBAGE!!!,2,6 November 2020,"I feel like this movie could've been a masterpiece, but obviously, it wasn't. The storyline was predictable and clichéd. The take on music was horrible and stereotypical. Rock is not evil, first of all. Second of all, not all rock is the hard metal crazy hair eyeliner head banging.
I could go on and on about how terrible this movie is. Any adult who finds this movie anything over mediocre is either high, or deaf.",Trolls World Tour
