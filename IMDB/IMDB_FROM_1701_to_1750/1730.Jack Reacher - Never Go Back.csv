0,TheLittleSongbird,Routine sequel to an enjoyable film,5,23 November 2016,"While far from flawless (with an uneven script, an anaemic and anti-climactic ending, a few too padded out moments and Rosamund Pike, an actress who impresses me usually, giving one of her worst performances in a disastrously indecisively written role) the first 'Jack Reacher' has a lot of great things still and judging it as a standalone is very enjoyable.'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' is not an awful sequel, but what was done well in the first 'Jack Reacher' isn't done well here. If there is one word to sum it up, it's routine. Apart from some direct-to-video-like production values in some of the action sequences, it's a reasonably well-made film. Stylishly and atmospherically shot mostly with a neo-noir feel while there are some good use of locations and the editing is tight and crisp, and not resorting to the often seizure-inducing shaky cam technique. The music is energetic and haunting without being brash or overly-bombastic, with very effective use of silence.Some of the dialogue is dry-humoured and witty, and a few parts are clever. Parts of the film are very energetic, and some of the action unyielding and adrenaline-pumping. The cast are a very mixed bag. Starting with Tom Cruise, as said talking about the first film, whatever has been said of him being physically completely wrong (often described by detractors as one of the biggest miscasts ever), he still makes for a charismatic and intense hero that has steel in his eyes and plays it appropriately straight despite the campiness of some of one-liners. Am amazed at well he deals with the action, his energy and dexterity are enviable. Patrick Heusinger does inject some quiet, brooding menace in a rather underwritten role.Generally though, the supporting cast are not close to being as memorable as in the first (which had Robert Duvall and Werner Herzog). Cobie Smulders tries her hardest but comes over blandly in a role that limits her to doing barely anything. Robert Knepper is similarly wasted. On the other side of the acting spectrum, Danika Yarosh's truly irritating performance, in an annoyingly and indecisively written stereotypical plot device role that is abused to overkill effect here, made me appreciate Rousamund Pike's performance in the first film better.Ed Zwick directs competently but not much more, nothing inept, just missing something and there was the sense that he was not right for the material. There is some nice interaction between the characters, but mostly as characters individually they are either annoying (Samantha) or sloppily underdeveloped (the villains, Knepper's character being a cipher practically). There are a few good action sequences here, but there are also just as many that reek of getting the job done competently but with not much spark or imagination.The dry wit and cleverness that is sprinkled sporadically in the script is overshadowed by the amount of dialogue that's forced, long-winded and bloated, while other humorous parts come off cheesily. The story has enough pep to stop it from becoming completely dull but there is a distinct lack of fun, mystery and suspense here, parts also feeling padded and convoluted. Again, nothing unbearable, nothing to get wowed or excited over, just competent paint-by-numbers plotting but not much more.Overall, the first 'Jack Reacher' was flawed but enjoyable, this sequel 'Never Go Back' is hardly amateur hour but feels routine and like something was missing. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
1,Leofwine_draca,"Not bad, but it could (and should) have been better",6,22 August 2017,"JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK is the second of two Hollywood adaptations based on the books of Lee Child. The first film was a pretty decent thriller, not amazing, and this film is much the same. It starts off very well with a strong first hour but gradually descends into becoming average in the second half. The problem I had with it is that Reacher is saddled with the stereotypically annoying/sentimental teenage girl, who constantly does dumb things in order to further the storyline. Otherwise, it's the typical conspiracy business, bolstered by good suspense and action bits, as Reacher takes down opponents in fleeting moments reminiscent of BOURNE. Cruise delivers an acceptable level of intensity in the lead and the direction from the assured Edward Zwick is fine, so it's just a pity that the story flags at times with bloated character work and too much 'hanging around' when it should be moving forward at all times.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
2,SnoopyStyle,robotic story,6,2 December 2016,"Former military investigator Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) takes down a smuggling ring run by the local sheriff with the help of his successor Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders). He goes to DC to meet her for the first time only to be told that she has been detained for treason. She had sent two investigators to Afganistan who were mysteriously killed. Her military lawyer is killed and Reacher is framed for it. While in detention, Reacher saves Turner from assassins and they escape. Meanwhile, a paternity claim against him has been filed by Candice Dayton for 15-year-old daughter Samantha whom he never met.The story, the execution, and quite frankly the characters are rather robotic. It's not actually exciting but there is plenty of fight action. There is no mystery or shocking twists or interesting reveals. The big climatic twist is barely a twist. The story unfolds in a string of events that aren't terribly compelling. The bad guys are willing to kill as many people as needed but this is the kind of movie where they always come up a little short ending with a hand-to-hand fight. On the plus side, Smulders delivers a tough character without it all collapsing into a romantic puddle although it threatens to from time to time. This franchise keeps doing the hat thing but it's not filmed well. The point is for the character to disappear. It needs a scene where we lose track of Cruise (or Smulders in this one) in a crowd. That would be movie magic. In the grand scheme of things, this movie punches a lot but the hits rarely hurt. It's an action movie with limited thrills.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
3,Prismark10,Out of reacher,5,27 November 2016,"Tom Cruise returns as Jack Reacher in the series of thrillers from writer Lee Child that Cruise has decided to buy the film rights to and adapt them through his production company.One Shot was probably the best book which formed the basis for the first film. The trouble is I do not think the Jack Reacher books are that great and it shows in the sequel because the source material is never more than mundanely plotted.Reacher returns to one of his old army bases as Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) someone who he has helped out in the past has been arrested and sent to a military prison with assassins not far behind who aim to snuff her out.Everyone Jack Reacher talks to about the Turner's arrest also comes to harm with Reacher being the main suspect as he was the last person to talk to them. It looks like Major Turner was investigating an arms smuggling operation in Afghanistan that implicates private contractors and some army insiders.Reacher also has another problem to deal with. A paternity suit where it is alleged that he is the father of a street wise teenager Samantha (Danika Yarosh) whose mother is a recovering addict. The bad guys find out about her and Reacher now needs to rescue her.This is an efficient workmanlike movie with a muscular performance from Cruise. I expected more groove from director Edward Zwick and elan from the script which just signalled everything in advance and the film also looked cheap.Whereas the first Jack Reacher film had a chilling performance from German director Werner Herzog as the villain, this film lacked someone as memorable as him. I am sure other European directors were available to play the despicable evildoer.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
4,claudio_carvalho,Full of Action,7,30 December 2016,"After accomplishing the assignment of dismantling a human trafficking organization, the former military and drifter Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) goes to Washington to invite his liaison Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) to have dinner with him. However, he meets her substitute Major Sam Morgan (Holt McCallany) that explains that Major Turner is arrested accused of espionage. Jack seeks out her veteran lawyer Colonel Bob Moorcroft (Robert Catrini) that explains that Major Turner is the also accused for the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan. Further, he also tells that Jack is being sued, accused by a woman of being the father of her fifteen year-old daughter Samantha (Danika Yarosh). When Moorcroft is murdered, Jack is accused of being the killer and sent to a prison. He sees that Turner and he have been framed and also that Turner will be killed by two assassins. However he rescues her and they flee; soon they realize that there is a conspiracy involving military people from the army and a contractor that is a powerful arm dealer. Jack also learns that Samantha is in danger and Turner and he rescues her. They decide to protect her since a skilled assassin (Patrick Heusinger) is hunting them down while they try to find the motive of the conspiracy. Who can be trusted?""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is a full of action film, also full of clichés and with a storyline that recalls Ian Neeson's Bryan Mills films protecting his daughter Kim. The plot is well-resolved and the cast is great. My vote is seven.Title (Brail): ""Jack Reacher: Sem Retorno"" (""Jack Reacher: Without Return"")",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
5,nogodnomasters,I don't like being followed,6,11 September 2017,"Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is back and teams up with fugitive Major Turner (Cobie Smulders) who is his military replacement to fight evil government contractors while on the run from both the government who want to arrest them and contractors who want them dead. Toss into the mix 15 year old Samantha (Danika Yarosh) who acts similar to Reacher and may be his daughter.The film has lost the charm of the first film. No one knows who this man was and his ways were unorthodox but effective. In this film, everyone knows him, and his antics are not much better than Seagal and less than Liam Neeson. Hopefully they will come up something closer to the original in the future, indeed, this one started out that way in the opening scene (the one in all the previews) but fizzles.Best line about Reacher: ""They ran out of medals."" Guide: No sex or nudity.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
6,kosmasp,Pun intended?,6,17 June 2017,"You do wonder if anyone was thinking about the title, when they made the movie. We're talking sequel here and you have a never go back in the title? I do understand people not liking to put a number after the initial title, because maybe they did marketing research and it doesn't really get people riled up ... but I don't think they chose right when it came to the sub-title for this one.Anyway, if this was the only thing that was wrong with the movie, everything would be alright. And it does start kind of intriguing. Although it quickly turns into a by the numbers kind of deal. It's not really bad and it does what it is supposed to (also action wise and everything) ... it's just not something memorable",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
7,classicsoncall,"""Does this mean dinner's off?""",8,8 September 2017,"I don't go with what seems like the majority here who complain that the film is terrible. I'll concede that it's not as good as the first film in the franchise; that one was plotted superbly with virtually no flaws or plot holes to detract from the story. This one's a little more predictable, as it deals with contraband weapons being sold to insurgents by a former shadowy military contractor.I'd point to the inclusion of Cobie Smulders as the bright spot for this picture. Her Major Turner character is no cream puff, and the action scenes she engages in nicely complement the heroics one expects of the film's principal character. Tom Cruise is competent in the title role, but the thing is, having a protagonist like Jack Reacher sued for child support is never going to work. If the guy says he doesn't know the woman, you can pretty safely bet he doesn't know the woman. I was surprised that the alleged daughter Samantha (Danica Yarosh) didn't understand the first thing about surveillance tracking capability of cell phones and credit cards, but it wasn't the actress's fault. She seemed fairly intelligent otherwise, but then again, at fifteen I wonder how many teenagers simply take the technology for granted and never give it a second thought. I mean, there are enough examples of really stupid people posting the most embarrassing stuff on you-tube that's enough to get them arrested, so I guess it's possible she was clueless.Oddly enough, I liked the character of The Hunter, portrayed by Patrick Huesinger. He was relentless, capable, smart and an interesting match for Cruise's Reacher. He nailed it when he described himself and his adversary, and provided insight into the movie's title when he stated - ""People like us, we can never go back to the world"".",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
8,jboothmillard,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,5,26 July 2020,"The first movie was pretty good, despite the questions of casting the lead actor, I kept missing the sequel a few times when it started showing on television, but I watched it eventually, directed by Edward Zwick (Glory, Legends of the Fall, The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond). Basically, drifter and former Army military police officer Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise, also producing) has returned to his old military headquarters, after busting a human trafficking ring on US Army land. He has been working with Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) by phone during his travels, who is holding his former command. He learns from Colonel Sam Morgan (Holt McCallany) that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained. According to Turner's attorney, Colonel Moorcroft, there is evidence that Turner is responsible for the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she has been framed. Moorcroft also tells him Reacher's old acquaintance, Candice Dutton, plans to sue him for paternity charges, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha (Danika Yarosh). Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him. Moorcroft is later killed by an assassin known as The Hunter (Patrick Heusinger), framing Reacher for the murder. Reacher is arrested and transported to the same prison where Turner is being held. When two hitmen arrive, Reacher neutralises them, then escapes with Turner. They go to Morgan's house, deducing that he is involved in the conspiracy, and extract information. The Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, later kills Morgan, again framing Reacher. Reacher and Turner see surveillance pictures of Samantha and realise she is in danger. They arrive at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding. Samantha is taken to Turner's old private school for protection, but Samantha uses a mobile phone, which the enemy is likely tracking. They make a quick exit, during which Samantha steals credit cards from one of the students. The trio go to New Orleans in search of Daniel Prudhomme, the only eyewitness to the murders for which Turner has been framed. During the escape from the airport, Reacher admits to Samantha he might be her father. Reacher and Turner find Prudhomme (Austin Hébert) in a derelict location, learning that he is connected to Parasource, a private military organisation that is trying to cover up the murders. Reacher contacts Turner's friend, Captain Anthony Espin (Aldis Hodge), to move Prudhomme into custody, but assassins ambush them and kill Prudhomme, while Reacher rescues a wounded Espin and discovers the assassins are Parasource contractors. Parasource's CEO, General James Harkness (Robert Knepper), sends The Hunter to capture Samantha after a stolen credit card used is tracked. Reacher, Turner, and Espin, acting on information from Prudhomme, intercept a shipment of weapons due to enter the country. There they confront Harkness and his men and accuse them of corruption. However, Espin finds anti-tank weapons as declared in the flight manifest. Before Turner can be taken back to custody, Reacher opens one of the weapons and dumps out bags of pure opium. They learn that Harkness framed Turner, who had been investigating his activities, while the two murdered soldiers had discovered that Harkness was selling weapons to insurgents then smuggling opium into the United States. Espin and his men arrest Harkness. The Hunter and his men chase Samantha through the streets of New Orleans to lure Reacher into a confrontation. One of the assassins is killed by Turner, while the other one is taken out by Reacher. The Hunter captures Samantha on a rooftop, but she manages to escape when Reacher arrives. Reacher and the Hunter have a vicious fight, ending with Reacher breaking The Hunter's arm, leg, and neck, before dumping his body off the rooftop. Following Harkness being arrested, Turner is reinstated to her command. And Reacher promises to keep in touch. Reacher goes to meet Samantha at a diner, telling her that he will recognise her mother when he sees her. It is revealed that Samantha's mother is a waitress at the diner, Reacher knows he cannot be her father, as they did not recognise each other. Reacher and Samantha then reluctantly part. Also starring Jason Douglas as Sheriff, Judd Lormand as Local Deputy, Madalyn Horcher as Sergeant Leach and Jessica Stroup as Lieutenant Sullivan. I agree with critics that Cruise's performance is a rather 50/50 affair, the macho stuff is laughable at times, but his charisma works well. It is slightly predictable setup, a journey to uncover a conspiracy of murder and espionage, and a targeted feisty teenager thrown into the mix, but you cannot help but be carried away by the fast-paced chase and fight sequences, overall it's a fun action thriller. Worth watching!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
9,Tweekums,Solid action with a somewhat cliché story,7,2 July 2018,"In the prologue we see protagonist Jack Reacher arrested; it turns out he was working with Major Susan Turner of the Military Police to arrest the corrupt sheriff who had just arrested him. Sometime after this he goes to Washington DC to see her and learns that she has been arrested for alleged espionage. He goes to see her lawyer and is told that she specifically said not to let him get involved... she doesn't want anything to do with a 'deadbeat dad'; something that comes as a surprise to Reacher as he has no children and doesn't know the woman who had claimed he was the father of her fifteen year old daughter Samantha. Soon afterwards the lawyer is murdered and Reacher is blamed. He is convinced that those behind the murder with be after Major Turner next so he breaks her out of military prison before collecting his 'daughter' who is being targeted to get at him. Together Reacher and Turner must discover how their situation is connected to the murders of two US Military Police personnel in Afghanistan and a shadowy military contractor. This will lead them to New Orleans where the truth will be exposed and the villains faced.If you are looking for plenty of action then this will is well worth watching; there are fights, gunfights, chases and explosions every few minutes. These are well executed and make it relatively easy to overlook the fairly cliché plot. We have protagonists accused of a crime they didn't commit; a child who needs protecting who does things that put her in danger; a dodgy mercenary group and a motive that will seem obvious to viewers but isn't mentioned by the protagonists till the reveal scene. Tom Cruise does a fine job as Jack Reacher; not too surprising as it is the sort of role he excels in. Cobie Smulders and Danika Yarosh are solid enough as Turner and Samantha even if their characters are mainly there for Reacher to save. Patrick Heusinger is suitable menacing as the main bad guy even if his character does descend into pantomime villain territory towards the end. Overall a fun enough action film that won't test the brain cells too much!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
10,paul_haakonsen,Every bit as entertaining as the first movie...,6,30 April 2017,"I did enjoy the first ""Jack Reacher"" movie from 2012, and found that Tom Cruise actually did a great job in that movie. However, I wasn't fan enough to actually keep up to date with news around this 2016 sequel. So it was a nice surprise when I happened to get a chance to sit down to watch ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"".With my liking for the 2012 movie, then I had a certain level of expectation for the 2016 sequel. And I must admit that director Edward Zwick managed to pull off quite nicely, and ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" turned out to be every bit as entertaining and thrilling as the original 2012 movie was.The storyline in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is equally thrilling and well-thought through as the first movie. In this sequel the character Jack Reacher comes across a big government conspiracy and find that certain people will go to great lengths to silence him and keep secrets in the dark.True to the first movie, there is a good amount of action throughout the course of this movie. And once again, both Tom Cruise and the other people in the movie step up and deliver where it counts.It is actually quite nice to see Tom Cruise in movies such as this, because he manages to capture the essence of the character quite well. And he does prove that he is an actor with talent, especially so since you don't associate him with his numerous other roles in other movies as you watch ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"".""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is fast-paced and has a good amount of action. But it is also a story that has some good writing to it, so it becomes a story that evolves and a story that is not overly predictable. This movie gives the audience value for their movie, no doubt about that.I could easily see a third movie coming to the Jack Reacher series, and if so, then it will definitely be a movie that I would watch.If you haven't already seen ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" then you should do so. It is not really a requirement to have seen the 2012 ""Jack Reacher"" movie prior to this, but it does add some depth to the character gallery.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

12,sunwarrior13,A Disappointing Jack Reacher Film From Tom Cruise,4,6 February 2017,"Is Tom Cruise probably now approaching the downward slope of his career?No,I am not saying that.I am saying that a film that has him alone is no longer enough to make money.He needs to make sure he will release a high quality film that plays to his advantage as a megastar for people to flock into theaters to watch him. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back now attests to that.Although it was reported that this film earned $160 million world-wide,it definitely was not enough for what his movie usually makes like Mission Impossible:Rogue Nation which earned more than $682 million world- wide.For non-Tom Cruise fans, they know and will readily admit that he is a limited actor who can only act a certain highly self-confident charismatic character.Nothing more.That is why he is practically the same charismatic character all throughout his film career whether he is a criminal Vincent in Collateral,a bartender Brian in Cocktail,a lawyer Mitch McDeere in The Firm and even the bald Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder.Cruise needs to be in the right material with the right people for many to flock to the theaters.Credit him to be able to do that in the last 30+ years of his career.Unfortunately,he comes across to this movie entitled Jack Reacher:Never Go Back,then it becomes somewhat a disaster.Apparently,playing Jack Reacher is not among his strongest repertoire as he has to show more of being a tough guy that everyone should fear rather than the women would love to sleep with. Even his small stature is against him in playing a physically dominant role. Aside from Cruise,I think that this film came up really short in terms of story and action scenes.Director Edward Zwick unfortunately made a film that played more or less to Cruise's weaknesses rather than strength as an actor such as his small stature that is presenting a tough guy image rather than charisma and less entertaining story that is full of clichés and predictability.Overall,Zwick and future directors must learn how to handle Cruise as an actor for better Jack Reacher sequels ahead in the future if they intend to make another one.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

14,zardoz-13,Reaching in the Second Reacher Movie,7,5 November 2016,"The biggest worry moviegoers sometimes contend with when watching a sequel is whether they should go back and see the original. ""Last Samurai"" director Edward Zwick's ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" qualifies as a satisfactory follow-up saga to 2012's ""Jack Reacher."" For the record, the filmmakers fashioned this film from the 18th novel in author Lee Child's bestselling Jack Reacher series. Comparatively, the original ""Jack Reacher"" was adapted from the ninth novel. Since I've read neither novel, I cannot criticize the movies for their fidelity to the source material. Nevertheless, you could skip watching the original again and still savor his above-average, often entertaining, but ultimately straightforward thriller. The biggest problem with ""Jack Reacher: Never Look Back"" is the shortage of surprises to make you sit up and shout. At age 54, Tom Cruise is starting to show his years, but he is still game for pandemonium. As producer, he provides himself with several snappy scenes involving close-quarters combat where he throws and takes punches that would put mere mortals down for the count. While the chief villain doesn't garner enough screen time to impress us with his perfidy, his sinister-looking, second-in-command henchman emerges as every inch a titan who takes nothing lying down until Reacher pummels him into pulp. Meantime, director Zwick, ""Equalizer"" scenarist Richard Wenk, and ""Love & Other Drugs"" scribe Marshall Herskovitz never give our hero a chance to dazzle sexy co-star Cobie Smulders with his amorous charm. By the way, she is no damsel-in-distress, and she knows a thing or two about street fighting. Although it doesn't top the original, this 'wrong person accused of a crime that she didn't commit' will keep you on your toes even when you suspect what is coming. Unfortunately, the familiar story suffers from predictable plotting, a conspicuous lack of quotable dialogue, and could have had ten minutes trimmed off its running time. Now, whether you either missed or skipped ""Jack Reacher,"" the protagonist is the only game changer in this franchise. A former U.S. Army Military Police officer with the rank of major, Reacher has long since left the military and lives off the grid without his own car, credit cards, and all the conveniences that most of us couldn't survive without for two days. Meaning, he doesn't carry anything more than he can pack up and exit with on the spur of the moment. Reacher amounts to a ""Lone Ranger"" of sorts with neither a mask nor a horse, but he can take care of himself because he is mentally and physically agile. Basically, ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is a conspiracy thriller about a military police officer, U.S. Army Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders of ""The Avengers""), who has discovered the shady shenanigans of a suspicious company that once made millions from its military contracts before the government shut them down. The villainous CEO of that company, a retired General Harkness (Robert Knepper of ""Transporter 3""), sets out to safeguard himself by knocking-off everybody involved in it from the Army side. Unfortunately, he wasn't prepared for Jack Reacher, Reacher's friendship with Captain Turner, or Reacher's ability to survive the worse beating of his life. At least, Harkness' second-in-command henchman that Reacher confronts is a formidable enough adversary to knock Cruise down. Known only as 'the Hunter,' this rough-hewn individual dresses like a villain, from head to toe in black, and lives for every burst of adrenalin that he can draw from an incendiary incident. He craves to kill, kills without a qualm, but actually has a modicum of honor. As I said earlier, I have no idea how many characters were kept from the novel, but the one character that ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" could have abandoned is the teenage girl, Samantha (Danika Yarosh of ""Heroes Reborn""), who doesn't have a clue about either cell phones or credit cards. Sadly, Zwick and company either imported or created this character to slow down our heroes and take the kinks out of what could have been a mysterious plot. Contrived is the only way to describe this character's inclusion in this yarn. She is around to make Jack Reacher look bad when we know there is nothing bad about a hero as virtuous as Reacher. As it happens, Reacher wants to wine and dine Captain Turner for delivering him from a close call at the start of the action. When our hero arrives in Washington, D.C., to surprise Turner, Reacher learns to his chagrin that Turner has been arrested for treason and refuses to meet with him. Reacher finds out that somebody has filed a child support document against him. Apparently, it appears that Reacher may have fathered a child out of wedlock 15-years ago that he never knew about, and nobody contacted him about this indiscretion since ""Jack Reacher."" Again, this entire subplot is disposable and detracts from what could have been a more compelling actioneer. At one point, the villains decide to concentrate their dastardly deeds against Reacher's presumed daughter, and Reacher must treat her like his offspring to keep her from winding up dead.This lackluster subplot snarls up everything and detracts from the impact of the two other characters. Not only is Captain Turner's character slighted, but also General Harkness is given the short shrift. The Turner heroine could have been more three dimensional if she had been given more to do instead of having to babysit Samantha. True, Samantha redeems herself in two scenes, but a tighter bound hero and heroine would have been more stimulating. Instead, Reacher spreads himself thin between two sketchy women. You've heard the phrase 'two's company and three's a crowd?' The filmmakers could have dispensed with Samantha and the whole Reacher-as-a-deadbeat-dad subplot, and ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" would have fared infinitely better. General Harkness never establishes his notorious credentials, and actor Robert Knepper is wasted. Altogether, ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" makes the grade, but it doesn't surpass the original.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Directed by Ed Zwick - who collaborated on the screenplay with long-time partner Marshall Herskovitz and Richard Wenk - the film connects-the-dots in all the plays for an atypical thriller with inept bad guys, a smirking assassin (Heusinger) and barely there sexual tension between its leads (with a subplot involving Reacher possibly being the long-lost father of teen Yarosh).

Unfortunately, this ""Jack Reacher"" fell into some stale clichés, all of which I can't stand: easily offended, gender equality seeking female officer that's as strong as a man twice her size, a petulant teenager that is simply misunderstood and the all important super showdown.Look, I've seen too many movies in my life which means I'm bound to see certain tropes over and over just in different clothing. Still, it annoys me every time and I'm not more forgiving simply because it happens in a movie franchise I'm fond of. Truly, the best part of this movie was the unsolved mystery aspect; everything else was filler to make a full feature film.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
18,neil-476,Average action thriller,7,21 May 2018,"Jack Reacher, loner ex-Military Police officer, visits Major Turner, a female officer he only knows from telephone calls, and finds she has been arrested. Reacher finds himself involved in uncovering - and being implicated in - a conspiracy: he and Turner go on the run. To add complication, they are saddled with a teenage girl who may or may not be Reacher's daughter.Tom Cruise plays Reacher in a second adaptation (out of order) of one of Lee Child's novels. The first one had an element of novelty to it - Reacher is an entertaining character, a principled loner, gifted at giving and taking a thumping, a good and dogged detective, and with a tendency towards pithy rejoinders - but that novelty is not present in a second offering. What is left is an action thriller with a plot which is effective, but which isn't going to surprise anyone who has watched more than half a dozen action thrillers in their life.Having said that, it is perfectly satisfactory as a basis for the suspense, chases, shoot-'em-up and beat-'em-up sequences which populate this movie. The trouble is that it all feels a bit generic - it's satisfactory entertainment while you're watching it, but there's an air of déjà vu to it.Cobie Smulders should have an underwear scene written into every film she appears in, as a point of international law.Cruise seldom offers less than value for money in terms of performance, and he is joined by Cobie Smulders as Turner, a women with nearly as much attitude and physicality as Reacher, Danika Yarosh as Samantha, Reacher's maybe/maybe-not daughter, plays her well, but the character is not very sympathetically written, and is hard to like. The villains are a mixture: some may as well have ""villain"" tattooed on their forehead. None is as memorable as Werner Herzog or Jai Courtney in the previous film.The action sequences are entertaining but, again, none is exceptional, and none matches the bathroom fight from Reacher's initial outing.If you enjoyed the first film then you are likely to enjoy this one, but you may feel slightly let down by a film which entertains but has nothing out of the ordinary about it.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
19,FlashCallahan,Jack Ryan: Never left the nineties........,6,5 November 2016,"Jack Reacher springs into action after the arrest of Susan Turner, an Army major accused of treason. Suspecting foul play, Jack embarks on a mission to prove that the head of his old unit is innocent. After crossing paths with the law, Reacher must now go on the lam to uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy that involves the death of U.S. soldiers.Tom Cruise goes back to 1992 in probably the most surprising sequel in a very long time. For one, the first Reacher wasn't really that great, Herzog aside, and the audience voted with their feet. Secondly, it's surprising that Cruise is starting up another franchise, especially when it's another action franchise.And there sure are a lot of books.....It's a perfectly perfunctory action movie with no real twists or surprises to note. This time, like many sequels, there is not only a sidekick, but a child who may or may not be his daughter.The film deals with its female characters in a very remarkable way, treating them with a lot of respect, especially when you bear in mind that this is nothing but an old school action film with a recognisable character and a legendary actor in the title role.Whatever you think of his personal beliefs, Cruise is still a wonderful actor, and has that Star Power that not many have these days. But his name alone can still generate a hit.if this film was a relative, it'd be Jack Ryan's big headed younger brother.Who needs to grow up just a little bit.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Plus there is a likable brat possible daughter and the 3 together are a cute team. The villain is played by Patrick Heusinger - don't get why he has got it in for Jack so much.

21,gradyharp,"'Strong guys don't hurt you, the weak guys do that.'",7,8 February 2017,"British author Lee Child returns with another installment in his popular JACK REACHER SERIES and with a screenplay adaptation by Marshall Herskovitz, Richard Wenk and director Edward Zwick they have made another successful espionage thriller for Tom Cruise.The plot is complex and has been well outlined as follows: 'After accomplishing the assignment of dismantling a human trafficking organization, the former military and drifter Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) goes to Washington to invite his liaison Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) to have dinner with him. However, he meets her substitute Colonel Sam Morgan (Holt McCallany) who explains that Major Turner has been arrested and accused of espionage. Jack seeks out her veteran lawyer Colonel Bob Moorcroft (Robert Catrini) who explains that Major Turner has also been accused of the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan. Further, he also tells that Jack is being sued, accused by a woman of being the father of her fifteen year-old daughter Samantha (Danika Yarosh). When Moorcroft is murdered, Jack is accused of being the killer and sent to a prison. He sees that Turner and he have been framed and also that Turner will be killed by two assassins. However he rescues her and they flee; soon they realize that there is a conspiracy involving military people from the army and a government contractor that is a powerful arm dealer. Jack also learns that Samantha is in danger and Turner and he rescue her. They decide to protect her since a skilled assassin (Patrick Heusinger) is hunting them down while they try to find the motive of the conspiracy. Who can be trusted?'It is all action, incredible feats of daring, massive violence, and the usual load of explosions, fires and car chases. But that is what these Jack Reacher films are all about. Cruise pulls it off and the supporting cast, while basically unknowns, provide fine backup. It is what it is. And there is a cliffhanger of sorts that will likely mean more Jack Reacher movies are in the works.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
22,Mr-Fusion,Back for more,6,10 February 2017,"Man, I really didn't think ""Jack Reacher"" would get a sequel, but I'm happy it did. It's a good franchise fit for Tom Cruise, even if ""Never Go Back"" doesn't quite live up to the excitement of the original - from the fight scenes right down to the pacing. And it's padded with a family drama that doesn't bear much of an emotional weight. But I like this character, which is why I'm fully behind this series. he's a guy who's mentally one step ahead of the opposition, and whoever s behind a given criminal conspiracy, Reacher's *going* to find them. The sequel seems to coast on this, but it's still a great angle. 6/10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
23,siderite,Really bad,5,29 January 2017,"I rate as objectively as possible, but trying to point out qualities that stand out, regardless of how I felt overall about the movies. Unfortunately, this film stands out by absolutely nothing good. Instead, it feels almost like a formulaic parody of action movies made by the Wayans: insulting.Again Jack Reacher is Tom Cruise, an intense ex military thug that can handle any situation by kicking ass. Fortunately for him, the movie only puts him in those kind of situations, so he's safe. Again he must save the girl, only that being part 2, he must save two girls: the romantic interest and the possible daughter.Forget that the romantic interest is of the age his daughter would probably be and that the daughter is there almost for comic relief only. What feels really insulting is how cartoonish are all the characters. Reacher is handling everything with his hands, even in gun fights. The woman is always getting kicked around for him to save and in the rare situations when she does handle herself she uses weapons and kills people in passionate anger. The daughter is a stupid arrogant teen who could have been safe a number of times in the movie, only she had to text or call or use stolen credit cards to put herself in danger. The bad henchman is a typical sadistic villain, with no real motivation or story. And the evil mastermind... let's just say that all of Robert Knepper's scenes were painful.Add to this the stupid plot, the moronic editing of the scenes and the mechanical nature of the direction and you get a 100% formulaic movie that satisfies no one and piles insult upon insult on movie makers, the military, airport security, women, men and viewers alike.Avoid this film.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Its actually good B-movie fun!'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' Synopsis: Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name. On the run as a fugitive from the law, Reacher uncovers a potential secret from his past that could change his life forever.'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' benefits due to its fast-pace, that keeps you in your seat. Though its a predictable ride, it still keeps you interested & the action is well-done. And it always helps if you have Edward Zwick calling the shots. The Veteran Director is on-point here & delivers an entertaining Action Film, that's worth your buck. Richard Wenk, Zwick & Marshall Herskovitz's Screenplay is predictable, but its well-paced nonetheless. Cinematography & Editing are decent.Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise scores well in his second portrayal as Jack Reacher. The Superstar is in form this time & is comfortable beating up the bad-guys.

25,MovieAddict2016,"Cruise is in fine form, but the movie is entirely forgettable and lacks the retro charm of its predecessor.",5,17 January 2017,"The first ""Jack Reacher"" film, by Christopher McQuarrie, was a pleasant surprise. It was a retro, '70s-style action thriller in the vein of ""Dirty Harry"" with old-fashioned stunt work, tangible special effects (the car chase is one of the best in years and more ""Bullitt"" than ""Fast and Furious""), and a fun turn from Tom Cruise, who clearly relished being able to play an unapologetic bad ass - he's usually tasked with playing good guys who are so cookie-cutter American Hero that they would never spit dialogue such as telling their enemy that they wish to drink their blood from the bottom of their boot.The sequel, alas, is pretty generic. McQuarrie is gone, replaced by Edward Zwick, who at one time was fairly distinct behind the camera, but the aesthetic approach of ""Never Go Back"" is that of a TV movie. Devoid of the sleek noir vibe of McQuarrie's film, Zwick has fumbled the ball here.Most action films would be given props for having strong female leads. This happened in Cruise's awesome 2014 blockbuster, ""Edge of Tomorrow."" But Colbie Smulders isn't given much to work with here, and frankly, the entire appeal of these Reacher books (at least as far as I have been told by its avid readers) is that Reacher is the main protagonist. The movie mistakenly sidelines him in favor of a not-entirely-convincing dynamic shared by Reacher, Smulders, and a girl who may or may not be his daughter. The movie deserves credit for trying to create supporting characters, especially strong female roles; but they just aren't developed well enough for us to care, and since Cruise is so good in this role, whenever they are stealing screen time it really does become a bit frustrating. The movie isn't bad, per se. It's pretty much textbook mediocrity -- Cruise is great, he clearly loves playing this character and I'd be down for another serving with someone like McQuarrie back behind the camera, but unfortunately it's pretty clear that Zwick either wasn't given full creative control here and the studio cut his film to shreds -- or, conversely, was given too much freedom and didn't understand what made the character/previous film appealing to audiences. The result is a movie that just exists, destined to be played on late-night rotation on TNT and generate merchandise sales for the studio, but one that will never catch on with home video audiences the way the 2012 film did.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
26,Hellmant,I don't really understand the negative reviews for this movie!,8,16 November 2016,"'JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2012 hit action movie 'JACK REACHER', also starring Tom Cruise in the title role. Both films are based on novels, written by Lee Child, about a former US Military Police Corps major, named Jack Reacher, that now takes on odd jobs as a vigilante drifter. In this film Reacher is framed, and trying to uncover a giant government conspiracy; with the help of a current military major, that's also been framed and now a fugitive from the law. The movie costars Cobie Smulders, Danika Yarosh, Patrick Heusinger, Aldis Hodge, Holt McCallany and Robert Knepper. It was directed by Edward Zwick (who also teamed with Cruise on 2003's 'THE LAST SAMURAI'), and it was written by Richard Wenk, Marshall Herskovitz and Zwick. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and it's only been a modest hit at the Box Office. I enjoyed it as much as the original (if not more).After busting a human trafficking ring, Jack Reacher (Cruise) returns to the Military Police Corps headquarters, he used to work at, in order to meet Major Susan Turner (Smulders); who he has possible romantic feelings for. Once there Jack learns that Turner has been arrested for espionage. Despite the fact that she asked him not to get involved, Reacher begins to investigate the crimes she's accused of. In the process he becomes framed as well, and the two both go on the run from the law together; while trying to clear their names. Jack also learns that he might possibly have a 15- year-old daughter (Yarosh), who also becomes involved in the conspiracy. I don't really understand the negative reviews for this movie, I found it to be highly entertaining. It does lose it's way, a little bit in the middle, but for the most part it's a solid action thriller. I love the Jack Reacher character, and Cruise's conviction to the role is impressive. I also think it's awesome that the film has a really strong heroine character as well, and the relationship between her and Reacher is never sexual (or overly romantic). It's just a really well made movie, despite the fact that it drags just a little.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhHTPB4y30",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
27,Robert_duder,The franchise holds together!,8,2 November 2016,"I was perhaps in the minority but the first Jack Reacher film was easily one of my favorite films the year it was released. I was absolutely excited for the next film. While Never Go Back in my opinion is a far cry from the original, it absolutely holds its own merits and proves this could be a long running franchise. This genre is not one we saw a lot of anymore. Its part thriller, action and mystery and the first movie definitely felt like an homage to similar films from years ago. Never Go Back is a little more modern feeling but unlike most sequels which goes for more explosions, more action, more of everything from the first, it almost feels like it scales back and goes more for story and that actually works for it. However, the action scenes in the first movie were so well done that you actually do miss some of the style and choreography. So Never Go Back holds its own story wise but the first film definitely takes it for balls to the wall action. Either way this movie was absolutely entertaining.Tom Cruise is one of those actors for me that no matter his personal life, its never affected the way I look at him as a star. He is one of my favorite and continues to be. He knows Hollywood inside out and backwards and works his butt off for his craft. He's passionate and has screen charisma in SPADES! Despite readers being upset at him portraying the apparently enormous Jack Reacher, I've never read any of the books so for me he is Jack Reacher and embodies the character perfectly. You even get more of a feel for his background this time around. Cobie Smulders is decent as Reacher's latest case. She definitely has the ""bad-ass"" angle down and is a strong female lead but I can't help but feel she isn't quite as strong an actor as former Reacher girl Rosamund Pike. I actually could have done without the side-story of Reacher's potential daughter played by Danika Yarosh. If this was a storyline from the books then I get it and Yarosh is decent and has good chemistry with Cruise and even better with Smulders. However, it is a painfully clichéd character. Fantastic character actor Holt McCallany is perfect for a Jack Reacher pseudo-villain and he is very good. I think he is underused and underwritten in a few ways but he still fantastic and has great chemistry opposite Cruise. Patrick Heusinger is also good as the muscle adversary against Reacher although again he is very under- developed as character but he only has one purpose. Edward Zwick is a fantastic director. If you look at his list of films, he has some definitive modern day cult classics (Legends of the Fall, The Siege, The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond and Love & Other Drugs) are films of his that I personally ranged from good to amazing. Jack Reacher 2 falls somewhere on the lower end of that spectrum and I'm not sure style wise he was right for this. I would have loved to have seen Christopher McQuarrie come back for the sequel because I feel like he had a real definitive style that fit the Reacher story. It is very apparent both directors had different agendas but both films are good in their own right. I can't even say the sequel doesn't live up the original because while I didn't think it was AS good for me, it had a very different flare so should be judged on its own merits. Regardless, I hope we see at least one more entry in the franchise because I am a Jack Reacher fan without a doubt. 8/10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
28,dromasca,parenthood pains for Jack Reacher,5,10 February 2017,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the kind of movie which I would probably have never seen unless I was on a trans-Atlantic flight, too tired to read but still sleepless, and prisoner of the Lufthansa movie list. I mildly admire Tom Cruise (mainly for past achievements, past meaning from another millennium) and I have no special rejection of action movies provided they make sense and offer something more than gun or fist fights and car races. So I went for this film, the result could have been worse, but also much better.Director Edward Zwick took a few ambitious themes in the past, with mixed results. Glory may have been his ... moment of glory, but then followed The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond, and Defiance - all very ambitious projects but only partial successes. Here his ambitions are much lower, as Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the second in a series which tends to be quite repetitive - wild action with corrupt military portrait-ed as the bad guys and one (or even more) ladies in distress to help. An extra element is added here - Reacher may or may not be the father of one of the ladies to be saved and spared any pain at any cost. Not a very original story, to be candid.What are we left with? A well made violent action movie and a moralistic story that seems even less credible than the amount of fist-beaten bad guys that are badly damaged during the screening time. The talent (and the price paid to enroll it) of Tom Cruise are not well spent here.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
29,lesleyharris30,"A Dull, Dreary Let Down,",4,31 May 2017,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a lackluster movie with a poorly developed plot, despite a stellar cast. The performances is what saved this movie from becoming a complete dud. Tom Cruise is in great a form as ever as the title character, his natural charisma and energy on screen is evident throughout. Cruise always has great chemistry with his love interest Cobie Smulders, albeit not as strong an actress on screen, she fits in to her role nicely. Reacher is very different in this movie, he is not the arrogant self centred man he was in the original. While I guess the writers wanted to add more humanity to him, it simply made the character far less appealing, as he was more predictable. The first movie worked because it was not written with Cruise in mind, however this film was, displaying him as more of a protagonist than an anti-hero as a result. It is more so a Tom Cruise movie, rather than a Jack Reacher sequel. As well as that, it is a ridiculously typical action film. There is not a single chase, or one choreographed movement, that we did not already see coming from a mile away, and it offers nothing that has not been used more effectively in other films. Every beat is predictable and I did not care for a single character. Slow and boring, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back let me down immensely, as a fan of the original, and I could not possibly recommend it. Jack Reacher discovers a secret from his past while on the run from the government. Best Performance: Tom Cruise / Worst Performance: Danika Yarosh",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

It's been awhile since I've seen the original so it's not fair to compare the two, but I remember liking the first one and I really enjoyed this one. The action is relentless, there is an actual story and the drama really helps move the movie along in a way that enhances the overall excitement. If there is a negative thing I can say about this it would be that, much like the Bourne movies, the main character seems almost invincible and you never really feel like he is in any type of danger at all. He can punch a car window, fall off a roof or take on a group of men at once and it never feels like he is in danger. That takes a little of the realism away, but then again, it does work in a movie like this. Overall, very entertaining and I liked this quite a bit.

33,atlasmb,"Cruise Plays Reacher Again, With Moderate Success",7,17 September 2019,"As someone who has read every novel written by Lee Child, I am very familiar with the Jack Reacher persona. His is the story of the lone warrior---a stranger who travels alone, who wanders the backroads, righting wrongs when he encounters them. Think ""Kung Fu"" or ""Zatoichi"". And he has a personal code: only use one's skills as a fighter to defend oneself, or others in danger.Another aspect of this benevolent warrior is his nearly-mystical abilities. Zatoichi is blind, but can sense what is around him. The Shaolin monk has trained his mind and body to be impervious and totally in tune with nature and his surroundings. Reacher is in touch with his biorhythms; he always knows the exact time of day and can program himself to sleep whatever interval he chooses.If you did not see the first ""Reacher"" film, the initial scene of ""Never Go Back"" quickly lets you know that this guy (Tom Cruise) is a badass, he has a moral compass, and he is spooky-good at knowing what will happen next. With no prologue, it puts his piece on the board and establishes his strength.Because he can, Reacher decides to travel to Washington, D.C. to meet and thank the woman---Major Turner (Cobie Smulders)---who gave him aid, only to find her in dire circumstances. This is prime territory for Reacher, who immediately knows she is the victim of a conspiracy. The story also places a young girl in his path. She (Danica Yarosh) may be a daughter he was unaware of.Though each woman needs his help, neither is helpless. Major Turner is a tough, adept fighter. The girl, Samantha, has street smarts and knows how to survive. Unfortunately, those who oppose them are professional killers with unlimited resources and political connections.Cruise may not be the Reacher of the novels, but he can play the tough guy, the imperfect hero. Here he brings his usual intensity and physicality. Reacher is part feral cat, part calculating machine, and the script shows some of that. The relationship between the three main characters, which grows out of necessity, is the strength of the story. The fight scenes and chases are well-choreographed, but not inspiring, nor do they have to be. The emphasis, properly, is on the personalities of the three characters who need each other.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
34,The-Sarkologist,"More action, less mystery",7,21 October 2016,"I guess it had been a while since I had been to the cinema and this film looked pretty mindless so I decided that I would spend my Friday night basically watching Tom Cruise run around beating people up (which is what he seems to do best, not that he is actually one of those fisticuffs type of characters, though he is in this one). Actually, come to think of it this movie sort of reminded me of that Liam Neeson 'I will find you and I will kill you' movie (I know the name but I can't quite think of it right now). Anyway, as I mentioned it is basically a fisticuffs action movie with Cruise running around being some sort of ex-military cop trying to bust open some military conspiracy and saving the day. Actually, it is based on a book so I suspected that it was going to be heavier on the mystery than the action.So, as I mentioned, Cruise is this ex-military drifter that goes around doing the military's dirty work, though not actually being asked to do it, but rather cleaning up the mess that the military doesn't really have time to clean up. However when he arrives in Washington to take his successor out to dinner he discovers that she has been arrested on a charge of espionage, and being the type of guy that he is decides to investigate, despite the fact that has been forbidden by her to do such a thing. In fact he is being your typical Hollywood ex-military guy – insubordinate and definitely not a team player, but being able to get things done, and actually rising up through the ranks at the same time – in a way I suspect that this may not actually happen in the military.Another theme that seemed to come out of this film is the nature of the drifter – that is something that is actually a reality in today's world, and in fact in anytime where the military is demobilised – they don't actually fit into a peaceful society. Okay, it is clear that Reacher was once the commanding officer of the Military Police but for some reason he retired (maybe that is in the first movie, which I am inclined to watch after posting this), but he simply cannot keep the military out of his blood, nor can he settle down. He is like the classic Amercian lone cowboy who comes into town, cleans it up, and then rides off into the sunset, not being able to form any substantial relationship (even though some characters try to form a relationship with him).The other interesting this is that even though a part of the movie suggests that he has a daughter, a part of me is always thinking that this is something that really couldn't happen to him – Reacher just doesn't seem to be the type of person who could really get that close to a woman. In fact we see this in the movie where there he is building a relationship with another officer only to have that torn apart when it comes out that neither of them can really submit to each other – the man is always playing the role of the man, and the tom boy simply cannot let the man play the man without being slighted by the implied suggestion is that she is a woman and there are some things that women cannot do. In the end what Reacher really is about, being all the action and the fisticuffs, is the loneliness of the returned veteran.However one thing that has left me curious – do female soldiers really wear khaki bras? I guess I'm going to have to Google that one.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The main bad guy doesn't even have a name!! Unless I missed it. Whilst still insanely young looking for his age, for the second movie in a row Cruise is looking older than in his previous movie. I think it helps with the weariness of his character. The final scene features some really good acting by Cruise, and if it stopped a minute earlier, it could have been heartbreakingly sad. Instead it kind of ruined itself. Cobie Smulders is fine, as is Danika Yrosh, but Robert Knepper is completely wasted. Why cast such a great actor, and then give him nothing to do??

Like the first film, which was based on the ninth book, this one was on the eighteenth. It was a stylishly made film. The actors were good, and their stunts were excellent. But not the storyline. This is a very familiar theme. You know, someone framed you and you go on to dig the truth while everyone trying to hunt you down. There are lots of close encounter, which give great thrilling entertainment. So, other than the story, everything looked fine.Jack goes to meet one of his ex colleagues at his old headquarters. But soon he discovers she's behind the bars and now he's too for the crime they did not do. So escaping from the prison and looking for clues, who framed them and why, all one by one disclosed with some excellent running-chasing action sequences. The film almost as good as any timepass action film. But like it was the new wine in an old bottle. So it won't work for everyone, especially those with greater expectations.The 55 year old Tom Cruise on the edge to become a veteran actor, but still he got that action hero macho in him. Probably another 3-4 films, including the upcoming 'Mission: Impossible' sequel. So this franchise could replace his cast with younger one in the future. Because another 20 books to go. Though, I'm thinking about the television series. Cobie too was awesome. The film justifies to its original, but not more than an above average.

37,Floated2,Generic and bland,2,30 July 2017,"After watching the original Jack Reacher film and not being much of a fan of that, I was not expecting much more from this sequel. Seeing as the reviews for the followup were worse than the original. Never Go Back feels more like a standard typical action film and less like a mystery and suspense that the first film was. This film is less exciting and with new characters, that are worse, nothing special and new occurs in this film that we haven't seen in past action films. A lot of clichés. It was clear this film was made for a quick cash- grab since the original film was a moderate success (thanks to the foreign market). The overall box office numbers for this film are lesser than the original and that may spark some case for concern regarding Tom Cruise's star power, or perhaps movie goers noticed the bad reviews, and decided not to watch this film in theaters. In some ways, this film feels like Taken (and a lesser version of Taken). In general, Never Go Back is quite dull, bland and what was good in the first film, is non-existent in this film.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
38,eddie_baggins,Jack Reacher shouldn't have come back,3,10 May 2017,"A usually charismatic presence that gives his all no matter the cause, I truly can't recall a time when I've seen acting superstar Tom Cruise looking as bored and tired as he does here, in the sequel nobody asked for and one you wish you never went back for, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.2012's Jack Reacher didn't exactly set the world on fire, but the big screen incarnation of Lee Child's continually popular creation was a fine thriller, with some above average set pieces and production values so there was quiet optimism that new director Ed Zwick (I demand to know what has happened to the man that gave us The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond?) and returning star Cruise could at least capture that mid-level success Christopher McQuarrie's film did but alas, it was not to be.A terribly unexciting affair that sees Reacher spend more time with his potential teenage daughter and uninteresting potential love interest Major Turner (played devoid of charisma by Cobie Smulders) as they fight bland baddies and try to discover the what's what of a shady military murder, Zwick fails to capture any of the excitement of the Reacher brand and for a big budgeted thriller that could easily provide thrills and spills, this lacklustre experience is something not even Cruise on the best form of his life would've been able to save.Feeling like a more downtrodden and less interesting version of his Mission Impossible loving Ethan Hunt, Cruise was a stoic if unmemorable Reacher in the series first instalment but here he has become nothing more than a passenger wandering through his own aimless journey and for perhaps the first time, Cruise the action guru feels slightly too old and hampered to be what we need him to be here and maybe a decade or so ago Cruise may've enlivened the sub-par material on offer here but at current face value, it's too much for the veteran to do and his upcoming films like this year's Mummy reboot will be needing much more from this movie maverick to succeed.Final Say – After a disappointing run at cinemas and lukewarm at best reviews, it seems as though we may in fact never be going back to this once potentially decent series and this lame, tired and genuinely unengaging Jack Reacher adventure will likely not even be a film those many dedicated fans of Lee Child's creation can enjoy.1 ½ salt shakers out of 5",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
39,TheMovieDiorama,An adequate sequel but doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor.,5,4 November 2016,"The sequel that not many people wanted but we got anyway, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is about the titular character getting involved with an Army Major who has been framed for espionage and they try to find out who is behind these false accusations. The first film was a pleasant surprise, I wasn't expecting much but it turned out to be a decent action film. A lot of people did not like it as they believe Tom Cruise wasn't the perfect Jack Reacher in height and build, but I don't read books (ain't nobody got time for that!) so I won't be making comparisons. Evidently it did well, hence why we now have a sequel that just isn't as good as its predecessor. Firstly Tom Cruise brings his game as usual, I have to admire his career and the fact he does all of his own stunts, he truly is a dedicated actor and you don't get many of them anymore. Cobie Smulders was good, she finally has some good screen time and hopefully she'll be in more in the future. The rest of the cast were adequate, they did their jobs fine. Edward Zwick (who directed The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond and Defiance) partners up with cruise again and is excellent, his direction was clear and thankfully some well done action scenes where I can see what the hell is going on. Speaking of said scenes, the fighting was brutal...and I put that lightly. You can hear bones snapping, you can feel every punch and there is a great scene where Smulders strangles someone with a hose. A good action film is where you feel the violence and damn, I felt it. Then we get onto the story, which is where the film falls. It is completely unmemorable. A weak villainous organisation, a weak subplot with the potential daughter of Reacher and no good car chase scene! The first film had such a good car chase! The script doesn't know which route to take and mixes the plot involving the potential daughter with the plot of the military espionage and it just loses focus so many times which really is a shame. Jack Reacher is unpredictable, we've seen it in the first film...but he is entirely predictable in this with a ridiculous cliché at the end. Overall, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is an adequate sequel with plenty of brutal fights and good performances but an unfocused plot and forgettable story means you won't be remembering this anytime soon.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

42,matthewssilverhammer,"""Never Go Back"" Indeed",3,31 October 2016,"With goofy hero quips, an awesome Werner Herzog villain, and quick hand-to-hand combat, 2012's Jack Reacher was a surprisingly diverting (if largely unnecessary) little holdover while we waited for the next Mission:Impossible movie. Never Go Back doesn't even quite reach that low bar. Where the first let Cruise be a no-nonsense vigilante with an 80s-esque action-star flair, this one shackles him to bad dramatics and dull posturing. In line with many of this year's other action sequels (Jason Bourne, Independence Day, Ninja Turtles, etc), JR:NGB is a generic disappointment with multiple problems. For one thing, it replaces its entertainingly corny action/comedy with eye-rollingly corny drama. The charm of the Reacher character was his lone-wolf modus operandi. Now the normally magnetic Cruise is saddled with two ill-advised sidekicks: a high ranking military official (played by the tough but wasted Smulders) and a precocious 15-year-old girl. Noble in its intentions to expand its diversity, it fails in the execution at every turn. The only way these cast additions might actually work is if you watched the first and thought, ""What action movies really need are annoyingly bratty teenagers & sexist relationship banter!"" Are there moments of fun that holdover from the original? Sure; Reacher uses nice sarcasm at times, and there's a Halloween parade setting that makes for an exciting setpiece. Otherwise, it's standard action movie trope after standard action movie trope (jittery black-and-white visions, gun fights in abandoned buildings, chases at shipping wharfs). Shockingly lacking in tangible levity or legitimate popcorn entertainment, Cruise should've never gone back to the Jack Reacher franchise if this is the best they could do.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

It's laughably stupid at moments, while it is meant to be taken seriously!The stench of a bad copy of the Bourne movies (with Matt Damon) can be smelled instantly. Even the soundtrack sounds similar to the Bourne series, but the Bourne credibility is NOWHERE to be found in Jack Reacher.I mean, seriously, this movie is meant to be taken SERIOUSLY. It is NOT meant to be a COMEDY, but it is laughable stupid and unbelievable. I dont get it. Tom Cruise CAN deliver high quality action movies, but these Jack Reacher movies are so terribly WRITTEN that I just get instant headaches.Just to give you 1, only 1 example of serious lack of credibility: 2 highly trained secret intelligence personnel try to break into high security military computers from inside a cafe with an insecure wifi hot spot. Then they act ""surprised"" they cant crack the security of the intelligence agency from within this bar! And their only ""disguise"" inside this cafe is a baseball cap. Yes, a baseball cap, so they wont get recognized, WHILE they are wearing ARMY clothing simultaneously. That's hilariously stupid.

44,subxerogravity,"Lost some of the coolness from the original, but adds some action with Cobie Smulders",7,23 October 2016,"That first Jack Reacher was so amazing! It really put to use Tom Cruse's ability to be a thinking man's action hero. It was just him with some total straight talk followed by some kick ass grips and breaks, plus Werner Herzog comes out of nowhere in it. It was so entertaining and so cool. So of course I was jazzed to watch Never Go Back, but my hopes were definitely too high. Not that it was not a good action movie filled with some good action scenes. The biggest problem is that Jack Reacher loses the edge he had in the first film. In this sequel, Jack develops a relationship with the Major that took over his old job, which is why when she got in trouble, he came to her rescue. Wanted for treason Jack Reacher gets Susan Turner out of jail and they are on the run while trying to figure out who framed her and why. This plot was already taking the edge off Reacher. As cool as it is to watch Smulders show us more of what made her so awesome as Agent Maria Hill in the first Avengers movie, this was not helping the character Jack Reacher as he is not cool with a love life. His interaction with Rosland Pike in the original may have not done as much for women's equilibrium, but the movie is called Jack Reacher. To be honest, however, Cruse is getting old. Known for that trade mark run he does in all of his action films, he seem to be going at a slower pace than what I'm use to, and not moving as swiftly as expected. In all fairness, Cruse is still very impressive for a 50 something year old, but you can see it. He's not even giving us the full frontal of his chest anymore. But getting back to the character itself, Reacher's love life was not the only thing effecting his coolness. Not to give anything away, but basically we learned too much about Reacher and it makes him too human and less larger than life, and that takes away the coolness. So overall, it's as decent of an action movie as the original, literally littered with the same elements that you like from the last movie, but the more Reacher shows his emotions the less intense he becomes, and Never Go Back needed that.I think it's time for another Mission: Impossible movie Tom to watch this taste out of our mouths.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
45,jtindahouse,One terrible character completely drains it,6,29 October 2016,"I spent almost my entire review of 2012's 'Jack Reacher' focusing on the poor casting of Tom Cruise in the title role. I still completely disagree with the casting. It has completely ruined for me what should have been an amazing film franchise. Cruise lacks the height, bulk, voice, haircut and personality for Jack Reacher. This is common knowledge and not something I'm going to spend an entire review criticising again. I've made peace with it and decided to review all future films in the series based purely on the story and film making skills alone. So here goes.'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' is based on the 18th book in the series. It wasn't one of my favourite books in the series, but I certainly didn't hate it either. It seems the movies are all going to be based on the ""larger' story lines, if you will. The ones with a lot of characters and a lot of bad guys all with big motives for their evil-doings. Personally, I prefer the Reacher stories that are simpler in nature. The ones where he goes to a small town, realises everything isn't as it seems, and gets to the bottom of the story. I can understand though why those wouldn't make for the best movies.The thing I hated the most in this film was the character of 'Samantha'. She was a liar, a thief and had an undeserved arrogance, and yet the film seemed to think we should love her. Why exactly? She is in almost the entire film and is nothing short of terrible in every scene she's in. Both bad acting and bad writing contribute to this. Cobie Smulders as 'Turner' on the other hand impressed me. I went in expecting to find her miscast, but she pleasantly surprised me. The film moves at a decent pace and some (not all) of the fight scenes and action scenes are well directed. What the series is lacking in the writing department so far though, is getting across the intelligence of Reacher. Reacher is supposed to be a physical beast (which he's not in the films), but he's also meant to be razor-sharp in his detective skills. I doubt anyone who hasn't read the books would be picking up on that from the movies (this one in particular). It's not a bad viewing experience, but there is still certainly a lot that could worked on if there is going to be a third installment.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
46,jamesrupert2014,Predictable Cruise action film - star-driven but not much else,5,6 August 2017,"""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016) is a formulaic action movie starring Tom Cruise playing his typical hyper-competent hero shtick. The movie opens with a silly set-piece in a bar with Reacher being unsuccessfully arrested for single handedly defeating a bunch of lowlifes, which sets the tone for the rest of the film, as Reacher is set up as he tries to help Cobie Smulders' Major Susan Turner character, who has herself been set-up. The movie then moves from set-piece to set-piece (escape#1, chase#1, fight#1, escape#2, fight#2, chase#2 etc) – all of which are pretty much the same. The villains are, as usual, lethally competent when dealing with anyone but Reacher and the army sufficiently inept that Reacher and Turner can easily escape from a high-security military prison. To provide the otherwise omnipotent Reacher with an Achilles' heel, a potential daughter is introduced, who is routinely menaced by the ""The Hunter"" (Patrick Heusinger), a verbose assassin who spends much of the movie exchanging alpha-dog barks with Reacher. The whole 'daughter' (Danika Yarosh) plot-driver is ridiculous – the girl admits that she encouraged her mother to file for child support but, as the mother and Reacher had never met, it is unclear (at least to me) why Reacher was chosen and how the army would know (as it could not have gone through the courts or Reacher would have recognized the girl or at least the mother). The answer is likely the tentacles of the bad guys messing with Reacher's records but why they would choose such mundane and easily disproved 'fake-news' to besmirch a guy with every medal offered by the US Army is puzzling. The whole movie suffers from coincidence and convenience. The girl is remarkably easy to find in a city full of people (even when she is not giving away their position by using credit cards etc) – even in the crowded streets of Mardi Gras, she seems to be a beacon attracting the heavies. One wonders, if Reacher and Turner are so clever, why they wouldn't at least cut the girl's long blond hair so she would not be an exact match to the picture being used to identify her or why, on a street full of masked revellers, it never occurred to the girl to put on a mask. Instead she runs through convenient channels that open in the crowd with The Hunter's goons in pursuit. Fortunately, unlike 'The Hunter' and Reacher, the goons are fragile and can be eliminated by a single punch or kick (Reacher has to be beaten half to death before he even bruises). Reacher is a typical Cruise action-figure role and the actor delivers exactly what his fans expect, no more but no less. Cobie Smulders looks great in the best fitting uniform in the US army, as well as in her tough-chick outfits, and various states of undress, otherwise, she's just background (typically, she's only as competent as the plot requires at any given moment). Danika Yarosh's is OK as ""Sam"" the pseudo-daughter, the weakest character in the story, as she goes from an extremely unconvincing street kid to a uniform-wearing school girl (a process that involves several cringe-worthy scenes). You just know that when they devote a whole lot of film to her bonding with tough-soldier Turner by learning how to disarm a person, she's going to play a pivotal role in the demise of ""The Hunter"" – so at that point, save yourself a half hour and fast forward to the final fight (then shut the movie down after the final gruff utterance and bone snap).",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

It's based on a series of books written by Lee Child-Never Go Back is based on the 18th and the 2012 movie was based on the 9th so they are not making them in any kind of order. A lot of people are mad at Tom portraying Jack Reacher because in the books, Jack is supposed to be 6'5"", 250 lbs. Now Tom is a good actor but he is 5'7"" and under 200 lbs, so I understand people's frustration. The author, Lee Child has said he is fine with Tom's portrayal-plus, I'm sure Tom's star power will get the seats in the theaters which means more bucks for Lee-and keep an eye out for the TSA agent that looks at Tom's forged id when he is about to board a plane because that is Lee Child making a cameo. I have never read the books so I can only judge on whether or not I liked the movie and I liked it. Tom is an ex-Major of the Military Police that now does his Lone Ranger bit, going around and helping people. He helps Colby-who is still in the military-on a little job and when she gets arrested for espionage, he helps her again. Robert plays a General that is involved in some illegal activity that catches Tom's radar and Danika plays a young girl that may or may not be Tom's daughter-Danika's mother filed a paternity suit against Tom for child support. There is lots of action and plenty of plot-for those who care about that kind of thing-and Tom still does pretty good for a guy in his 50's. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Tom cruise plays jack reacher to allot of criticism from people who love the books. I haven't read the books and I thought cruise did an alright job in this film.

Then there is the girl who accompanies them on the journey and she is so incredibly annoying and doesn't add anything positive to this film and just succeeded in annoying me.

It turns out that there is a wider conspiracy involving a company called Para-Source and Reacher and Turner must get to the bottom of who Para-Source are and why they want Turner dead? Matters are further complicated when Reacher finds himself with some rather unexpected baggage...I enjoyed the first Jack Reacher film (in spite of the fact that it offered very little that I hadn't seen before). It was fast-paced, entertaining whilst also offering a fairly decent storyline. I really wanted to like the sequel, but just couldn't quite warm to it in the same way that I could with the first film...Part of the problem with this sequel lies with the story and no matter how much it tries it simply isn't as involving or engaging as it was in the first film. Despite the fact that this film runs slightly shorter than the original it actually felt much longer. The original film suffered slightly with poor character development and underdeveloped villains. This film has the same problems only they are worse in this sequel. Robert Knepper is on villain duties as normal, but he's only featured in a couple of scenes and isn't given the opportunity to make any real impression on the picture. The story is also a little weak and if I'm totally honest a little uninteresting. In this sequel, Reacher also discovers that he may have a daughter and finds himself having to protect the girl who he believes may be his daughter as well as exposing the truth about Para-Source. I presume that the potential 'daughter' may have been introduced to show a different side to Reacher and perhaps to give him a back story, but truth be told it didn't feel entirely necessary and in all honesty it's a strand of the story that I didn't much care for.Having said all that, the film isn't all bad and does still have some impressive action sequences and some of the chase scenes towards the end are moderately exciting and entertaining. However, as I've said the story is weak and uninvolving, the supporting cast don't make much of an impression leaving the action sequences being the only thing worth watching in this film.One other thing; how did the hit-man manage to get to New Orleans before Reacher and Co when they left for New Orleans before him? Unless Para-Source are sending their hit-men by private jet in order to carry out their hits? Yes it's sloppy, largely uninvolving and weak in comparison to the first film.

Still, the newcomers all add a decent amount with their performances. The premise, meanwhile, is less interesting than that of 'Jack Reacher', but it still makes for solid action.Tom Cruise (Jack) is, as you'd predict, the clear best part of this follow-up. That man does a lot of productions in this genre, in that regard his performance doesn't feel majorly different from his other work but the film is at its highest point when he is onscreen. Cruise is joined by the pleasing Cobie Smulders (Turner) and satisfactory Danika Yarosh (Samantha). Elsewhere, you have the underused duo of Aldis Hodge (Espin) and Robert Knepper (James).In conclusion, this may not match 2012's effort but there is still fun to be had.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

You're under arrest.""",6,13 March 2020,"This was pretty good, I enjoyed it more than the first one which I think was mostly down to Cobie Smulders, I liked her and her (kickass) character a lot. She plays Major Susan Turner who gets accused of treason. Tom Cruise works to exonerate her which of course causes the both of them to get tangled up in a conspiracy.I also liked the storyline more this time around with the inclusion of Tom/Jacks ""daughter"" she brings a softness, a humanness to him. Lots of Tom Cruise running (as expected) He and Cobie run together a fair bit, which must have involved some practice for her to to get his pace and unique style. Tom is Tom, which is fine, he gives his all but by now has just become a cliched action hero, nothing we haven't seen from him before.There's a good foot chase scene through the streets of new Orleans and a decent car chase but for the most part the whole movie is predictable and I found myself kinda bored half way through Tom/Jack does some like superheroish things for just a man; punching through car windows to grab bad guys, dumb.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

60,TdSmth5,Awful,5,27 October 2016,"Reacher is about to visit one major Turner at his former military unit with whom he's been flirting over the phone. She's helped him with some investigation. When he arrives he's told by colonel Morgan that Turner has been arrested for espionage. Oh, and someone is filing a paternity suit against him claiming that he has a daughter. Why this ends up in the military who knows. Reacher is followed around by some sinister guys. He has words with her lawyer. He finds his alleged daughter Samantha. The next time he visits Morgan he's arrested for supposedly killing Turner's lawyer. We have already met an even more sinister operative who's up to no good.In the military jail, Reacher easily manages to outwit everyone and save Turner just as two assassins are about to kill her. Now the two escape, are chased by tons military police plus the dark ops guys who are employees of a government contractor named Parasource. When the really bad guy threatens Reacher's maybe daughter they find her and she joins them in their investigation/escape/search. As all teens in movies she's annoying as heck, always doing stupid things she shouldn't be doing and occasionally helping.Reacher and Turner are continuing her recent investigation into the death of two of her guys in Afghanistan. There Parasource got involved in bringing back the weapons left by the US military but they ended up selling them to radical groups. Still, the math doesn't add up, why would this company risk a billion dollar contract over a few million they make re-selling some used weapons? The investigation takes them to New Orleans where all the bad guys converge, plus the next Parasource plane from Afghanistan is also about to land, and of course the girl gets herself in trouble.Jack Reacher II is a major disappointment. In Part I, Reacher was the center of the movie, yet he worked in the shadows; he was someone people whispered about. Here for some reason he's out in the open and from the get-go he's treated like some hero, everyone not only has heard about him but apparently recognizes him too. Cruise has always played the hyperbole and impossible situations almost a little tongue-in-cheek which is fine. Once he's joined by Turner things go downhill fast and are dragged further down when the girl joins. Instead of being the lead character he suddenly becomes the sidekick with Turner bossing everyone around. Cobie Smulders is a lovely girl, especially with her hair down, but she's not lovely at all when she's screaming around and pretending to kick butt. Meanwhile Cruise is limited to raising his eyebrow or clenching his jaw, not saying a whole lot anymore. Usually Hollywood has treated this political correct nonsense like it's divine law, but this time around the characters actually argue about who's the boss and it's gut-churning pathetic stuff. And it took 3 writers to come up with this? Reacher finding a side-kick and forming a family is fine, but not in the second movie. This stuff would have been OK for the final movie in the franchise. If ""Never Go Back,"" which doesn't even refer to anything, is the final installment, fine, but I suspect it won't be, and I can't imagine Cruise & Co. being able to drag themselves out of the deep hole they dug for themselves with this mess.Jack Reacher I was entertaining, interesting, even a blast. Reacher II is just an embarrassment.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Worse still, the antagonists come across as bumbling and inexplicably foolish. His success is never in doubt.The result is a film that's ""light weight"" entertainment at best.

64,Samiam3,Clichéd mail-in of a sequel. Smulders is the highlight.,5,17 July 2017,"An irony of mediocre movies like Jack Reacher is that they lead you to have low expectations of sequels, allowing the positive elements to stand out. Never Go Back is just as far from greatness as its predecessor, but it moves a little better. Director Edward Zwick (who is clearly in this for the money) streamlines the movie almost to a fault. An over edited movie can make the world seem like a very small place.Kudos to Cruise for wiping most of the smugness off his face, but compared to the young blooded Cobbie Smulders, he feels like a sour old crone. Never Go Back is more entertaining when the camera is on her. She is not a big woman but she is a force to be reckoned with. At one point she threatens to grab a superior officer by the hair and b***h slap the s**t out of him. Her sincerity is so comanding that it almost makes you understand why such cheesy lines make it into scripts. Half of the script in fact is comprised of this kind of dialog; ""I want names numbers, phone records, favourite flavours of ice cream""The action scenes are largely derivative of similar set piece from past movies, especially the old' punch out in the musty boiler room, or the chase scene through a carnival crowd. The material pairs up Reacher with a daughter character: the generic rebel child he never knew he had until he was told. She is a device used more for plot advancement than for emotional impact. There is a goodbye scene at the end which would have been stronger had it been in any other (better) movie. The single biggest problem is that Never Go Back exercises almost every cliché of the genre; from the people who are corrupt to the custody escape by means of a guards uniform. At least we have the delights of Smulders to offer some relief.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

I know she's been a background character in a few Marvel films but she is just a sitcom TV actress at best.

67,rgkarim,His Reach Fell Short,7,23 October 2016,"Seems this weekend is all about prequels/sequels coming to the theaters. Robbie K here reviewing Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, which promises to have some mystery, action, and comedy to entertain us. But will Hollywood deliver on its promise, or will we get another lackluster sequel from the generic mold?LIKES: Fast Pace  Comedic Timing  Solid castingIn my experience, crime stories tend to drag out a bit before getting to the juicy drama and violence. While this film is a little slow and convoluted at the beginning it does cut through most of the boring fat to get to the action packed meat. The pace continues to pick up through the movie, as constant pursuit from the enemy keeps our small band on their toes throughout the country. While some of the slower character building moments are integrated into the intense game of hide, seek, and run, they are often short, entertaining sequences that are there to set up for the impending ""excitement"". Rest assured, Reacher's latest journey connects the dots in rapid succession to get you to the answers as quickly as possible. And like the last installment, you might be hoping for some witty comedy to help relieve the tension of the constant chase. Good news, the writers adapted the book to provide Reacher's famous dry humor. For those who don't know, this movie's style isn't slapstick and stupid one- liners to be endlessly quoted. Instead Reacher's comedy is dry where timing is the main punch line rather than mindless babbling. Seeing Cruise react to some of the scenarios or deliver a sarcastically flat response were the funniest components of the film. I felt the comedy was well integrated into the tale and not abused to keep the laughs as fresh as possible. Of course the comedy and story would be nothing without a good cast, and Reacher has a great lineup to keep you entertained. All of the cast feels like a solid military crime family, each playing that stereotypical, no nonsense attitude cinematic soldiers seem to have. While not as tall as book Reacher, Cruise's rogue nature mixes well with Smulders modern age warrior woman to craft a realistic, crime solving MP duo. Ms. Yarosh as the edgy teenager from a broken home also played her part well and added a twist that both worked and annoyed me at times. And as for the hunter, Heusinger played him well but I don't think the character direction worked for me (more on that later). Still the cast overall make you feel part of a government conspiracy, which gets a plus in my book. DISLIKES:  Action is short lived  Annoying character tendencies  Little mystery and suspenseThe trailers paint for action, but sadly that action has been greatly reduced to Reacher being in small scuffles that usually detail some poor extra getting knocked unconscious in a single punch. Occasionally you get some gun play involved and a chase scene displaying Cruise's agility, but even this lackluster at times. While a former veteran appreciated the realistic battles, I was hoping for a little more excitement and tension to grace the screen. This nearly happened at the end, but that scene crossed into a drawn out, ridiculous torture that while justified, did little but make my eyes roll. While the action scenes may have been annoying at times, there were a few characters who ground my gears. Samantha in particular was an irritation, as her portrayal of an edgy teenager, whining about everything did little to entertain me. Samantha's arrogance can be entertaining at times (and was important for character development), but there were a good number of shots that had me hoping Reacher would slap some sense into her. And as for the hunter, well he doesn't win the award for scariest motive, merely a mercenary with delusions of grandeur to feed his obsession. His skills are certainly impressive, but his drive is lacking and kind of stupid. Yet the biggest disappointment had to be the lack of mystery and suspense in this movie. In the first installment Reacher had to dig deep to find the perpetrator by pushing his skills to the limit and using ingenuity. In this film though, the quest was almost too easy for Reacher, with all the pieces falling to conveniently into place that is uncharacteristic of a crime thriller. The source of the corruption was sloppily revealed in the form of pointless character I cared little about and lacked the twist of the original. Of course the surprise isn't helped by obvious foreshadowing introduced in what would be perceived as unnecessary scenes.THE VERDICT:Overall Reacher's latest adventure is a more diluted version of its predecessor. For me the cast is the strongest aspect in this fast paced adventure who will set the stage for the adventure. However, the lack of a challenging mystery was a major disappointment that didn't have the action to make up for it. If you are looking for some realistic crime/adventure you might check this out, but I recommend most wait for RedBox to pick this flick up. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Crime: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
68,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Jack Reacher: Never Go Back,5,29 October 2016,"If you factor in adjustment for ticket price inflation, 2012's Jack Reacher is one of Tom Cruise's worst box office outings. I still gave it a favorable rating. Am I surprised however, that Paramount Pictures actually green-lit a sequel for an October release? Oh you betcha. Out is director Christopher McQuarrie (The Way of the Gun, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation). In is director Edward Zwick (The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond). Cruise is the producer so hey, he must be playing favorites again.Anyway, the first ""Reacher"" film had its moments despite a tolerable reception. It stuck in my mind as a slick thriller, a flick notable for its nasty hand-to-hand combat sequences. McQuarrie knew how to frame Cruise in said sequences. With Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (my latest review), Zwick has it pan out more sloppily, kind of like Christopher Nolan in most of his films (pick any one of them). Edward Zwick is good with gunfire and historical epics. Unfortunately, he's the wrong guy to showcase Tom Cruise in bone-cracking, kick butt mode. Oh and Zwick tries to recreate New Orleans in ""Never Go Back's"" climatic moments. The whole thing was shot in Pennsylvania making The Big Easy look more like a theme park instead of an actual location.At well over two hours, the first Jack Reacher is twelve minutes longer than ""Never Go Back"". But heck, it moves more swiftly, has more threatening one-liners from Cruise, and doesn't include the sappy, sentimentality factor (Jack now might have a daughter that he never knew of). I mean it's just a better movie. For instance, I liked it more in 2012 when Tommy boy quipped, ""I mean to beat you to death and drink blood from a boot."" In 2016, his Jack occasionally just says, ""I don't like being followed"". Bummer.Bottom line: As I viewed Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, I thought to myself, Jack Reacher ""never go"" forward. With this ho-hum sequel, Reacher's franchise can't possibly continue in years to come can it? I mean we're not talking James Bond here are we?Unnecessary sequels and pulpiness aside, Tom Cruise for what it's worth, is still decent in the lead role. Its been said that he's miscast because of his height (the Jack Reacher from the books is six feet, five inches). Whatever. In my mind he fits the part like a comfortable shoe. He's admirable. Around him though, ""Never Go Back"" isn't as much. There's no Robert Duvall from the first outing to keep him company. There's a lack of good villains like Werner Herzog and Jai Courtney (both from the original ""Reacher"") to get his blood pumping. No the bad guys from Jack Reacher: Never Go Back are unknown actors, pawns who think they can hang with good old ""Maverick"".In retrospect, ""Never Go Back"" has some excitement in the form of chases by car or by foot. And Cobie Smolders as Cruise's female co-star, has some bite in her performance. Nevertheless, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back still lacks the mystery, the suspense, the intrigue, and the effectively hardcore fist fights from the first Jack Reacher (the producers should've stopped right there). It instead thrives on a convoluted plot, a saccharine ending, an annoying, teenage sidekick (Samantha played by Danika Yarosh), and an incorrigibly faux wink wink to the follow-up gods. ""Never"" a recommendation from me. Rating: 2 stars.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

72,quincytheodore,A less engaging affair for Jack Reacher,6,19 October 2016,"The first Jack Reacher was a fairly effective action thriller because it's the sum of many refreshingly different elements. The crime mystery was decent, characters were engaging, especially the enigmatic villain and it even produced occasional timely humor. On each its own it may not be ranked the absolute best, but combined together they made a good case for Jack Reacher.Instead of these aspects, Reacher is now poised for semi-father figure role. Apparently action stars would go through this phase, following the footstep of Liam Neeson and the most recent Mel Gibson. This is by no means bad since it portrays him in a more humane way, it's an acceptable direction other than constantly treating him as a legend.The main issue is it's the same formula of ""protect the daughter"" seen in many others movies. They would run, fight and hide, then do it all over again. There's no layer of puzzle that's slowly peeled along the way, or at least it's not on par with the case from first movie. The perpetual running can feel dreary at times even though they are passing fine locations.There are few good spots, but they are far from being the spectacle one would expect from IMAX investment. Furthermore, aside from the few bits of father-daughter gimmick, the characters are stagnant. Tom Cruise, and the overall case for that matter, can do much more. The rest is cobbled together by fisticuffs, random shootings and minor flair in conspiracy.While it may not be a complete downgrade, this is a step back from a healthy crime thriller of the first.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

There were some lines in this movie that were predictable, such as ""that's what I would do"" regarding his daughter. All in all, I would suggest you see this movie as it is really great. I can safely say that the fight scenes in this movie surpass the fight scenes that Matt Damon did in his Jason Bourne series. I'd like to see a movie with both characters fighting each other.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
74,Troy_Campbell,Bland and uneventful.,4,20 October 2016,"2012's Jack Reacher was not by any means an amazing success, critically or commercially, however it at least provided an abundance of bone-crunching and popcorn-munching fun with minimal fuss. Sadly the same can't be said for this formulaic and utterly unmemorable sequel that, despite the valiant acting efforts of Tom Cruise and Cobie Smoulders, feels like it is operating squarely in first gear. After being accused of murder and espionage, the Cruiser's eponymous ex-military investigator and Smoulders' kickass army Major Turner are chased across Washington D.C. and New Orleans by murderous military contractors. The action is passable, barely, but lacks any sort of imagination or energy. Director Edward Zwick shoots his set pieces in the most mundane way possible, with choppy editing and a ridiculously overbearing sound design (where each punch sounds like a slab of meat being pounded against a wall) unsuccessfully utilised as intensity-builders. Adapted from the Lee Childs novel of the same name, the extremely dull plot goes nowhere in a hurry and struggles to overcome a confused tone that isn't sure whether it wants to be a serious thriller or a light hearted on-the-run adventure, subsequently failing on both levels. It's surprisingly sentimental as well, which actually works to a certain extent thanks to the three-way dynamic between Reacher, Turner and 15-year-old tagalong Samantha (Danika Yarosh), who may or may not be Reacher's daughter. Although there's mixed signals about the female empowerment angle the film clearly wants to comment on; despite numerous conversations and entire subplots about on the topic, Smoulders is either absent or lagging behind in the action sequences that count. But at least the charismatic Smoulders is given a decent character arc to work with, which is a lot more than Patrick Heusinger is offered in his role as the indefatigable assassin who is so laughably one-note he makes Jai Courtney's henchmen from the original look positively jazzy. The sporadic sly gag and the lead duo's exuberance save this from being a complete disaster, yet this follow-up remains a massively bland and uneventful affair that isn't worthy of a trip to the cinema.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

This one isn't just about another case Reacher has taken up; it's also about the emotional bond between the characters which has portrayed brilliantly without pushing the fil, into an excessively dramatic zone.NEVER GO BACK is an out and out action thriller just like the first one. There are plenty of solid fistfights, running, explosions, gunplay and everything you expect in a Tom Cruise action entertainer. He has undoubtedly done a great job as always. This time, it's not just about him and thus other characters too get to breathe. Cobie Smulders is impressive as the action hero, Turner. Rest of the cast has delivered very strong performances as well.The screenplay is not very complex and at times you might even get the feel of watching a family story unfold. This film isn't as complex as the first one but that makes it different from the first one instead of an imitation.

79,PartialMovieViewer,Not as Good as Number One,7,27 October 2016,"First I like Tom Cruise action movies. They pretty much are going to deliver what is expected - action...with no political garbage, no PC garbage, no wimpy-teary-eyed-sniveling characters and no boredom. I don't know what happened on this flick. Don't get me wrong, it is good, but I would have enjoyed a lot more. It is, as expected, a fast paced, well filmed gala event, bolstered by quality CGI and good acting. For the most part, everything is firing on all cylinders. The one drawback I noticed is that there is an added depth to ""Jack Reacher."" Depth? Really? Why? I really don't know if J.R. is supposed to have depth or not. You see, I have not read the books and the only real criticism I ever heard about the two productions is that Tom Cruise is just not tall enough to play Reacher. Well let me see if I can get over that? Yup - not to worry, I got over all that junk with the first movie. The one thing I did learn about the character is that no one...but no one messes with J.Reacher. So with all this under my bonnet, this series-installment did something I wish it hadn't and that was to get into the human-side of the character. I don't want to beat this drum too much, but the touchy-feely-boo-hoo stuff does not fit my expectation-fold. I kind of prefer the original character-persona. Someone is in trouble...Jack mysteriously shows up out of nowhere...beats up a bar-full of drunk ruffians; has many high-speed chases and intense fights (which he never-ever loses); terminates a huge nest of baddies, and mysteriously leaves. For me - this formula works every time, just change the town. Putting all my selfish whining aside, I did like this movie - a lot and recommend this to all those action-movie fans out there.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
80,rockman182,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016),6,5 January 2017,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed Jack Reacher in 2012. It had a nice complex-ish story mixed in nicely with good action and style. This made it an enjoyable popcorn flick. You can't ask for more from a film like this (and something with Tom Cruise). With all that in mind, I can't say the trailer for its sequel brought much excitement. Jack Reacher was always going to be a film series, it just seemed marketed that way. Its just a bit of a shame that the sequel does not live up to or succeed its predecessor in anyway.Jack is back, and this time he and Major Turner are on the run after being framed for espionage. While they try to clear their name a wise cracking 15 year old teen is thrown into the mix. Not very exciting. This film seems like a step backwards for a franchise that had a promising start. The original had a better cast, fight scenes, and was written in a way where you couldn't exactly tell what was going to happen (or maybe I just wasn't smart enough to figure it out). That's not the case here. This film treads ground that is all too familiar. You know exactly what's going to happen. The film seemed like The Fugitive but worse. I like Cobie Smulders, but her and Cruise weren't a great pairing; its a step down from Rosamund Pike.The film has a not very memorable, prototypical villain who strikes the same chords of generic spy films of the past. You can't get behind loathing this guy and that's a problem. If a film isn't allowing you to connect with its main characters you just go through the motions of the film without really feeling anything. That's basically how this film felt for me. Everything about this film just screams average. There are a few moments where the dialogue is just so bland, you wonder how it was written and approved into the script.It may sound like I'm complaining a lot but it really is the case that this was such a step down from the first film. The more infuriating bit is that its an Edward Zwick film and he brought us two pretty sensational films in The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond. There's real raw emotion in the latter, something that's completely lacking in the new Reacher. Its just another sequel that got churned out into the mix and I think it clouds the quality of the future films. I may 'never go back' to Jack Reacher after this effort.5.5/10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
81,jon.h.ochiai,"Fun, Could Have Done More",6,27 October 2016,"At one point in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" Samantha, who may be Reacher's daughter, played by Danika Yarosh says to Tom Cruise's Reacher, ""You are so intense."" Yeah. Reacher is either running really fast or beating the crap out of the bad guys. I'm a Tom Cruise fan, and here he is all intensity and little else. That is surprising. Cruise looks amazingly fit, and he has transformed into the formidable action star in the last 15 years or so. Though his performances usually balance his singular intensity and focus with humanity. I was excited that Cruise re-teamed with director Edward Zwick; they did ""The Last Samurai"", one of my favorite movies. That movie was about warrior, honor, and compassion. ""Never Go Back"" is only about kicking ass. Granted the movie delivers a predictable payoff and does have a gentle end note. I expected more eloquent with substance. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go back"" is a fun movie, not a great movie. At times it is almost ridiculous how much running Cruise and Cobie Smulders as Major Turner do. The fighting scenes are amazing. Cruise has become a solid martial artist. The fight scene in the darkened warehouse is high impact. The movie adopts a compact street fighting martial arts style with crisp hooks, sweeps, and joint locks. At times the quick cut editing distracts. Smulders is up to the task. She holds her own with Cruise in a kitchen sequence with assassin The Hunter (menacing and strong Patrick Heusinger). Smulders refreshingly adds a motherly feel in relationship with Sam (Yarosh). Conversely, Cruise displays forced awkwardness in this perplexing parental theme. The writing seems off. The key example is the vicious fight with Reacher at the story arc. The execution and emotional impact land clumsily. Zwick, Richard Wenk, and Marshall Herskovitz wrote the screenplay from Lee Child's novel. I'm unfamiliar with the Reacher series. Based on the popularity of the books, I presume the material is solid. I also did not see the first ""Jack Reacher"" movie. Zwick worked with the other writers before, with their focal point being relationships and ideas. Here Cruise and Smulders do their valiant best to overcome the thin narrative. Yarosh is confined by the troubled loner of Sam, who now relies upon Reacher's protection. However, the movie does work when all are going full speed and doing their best to save each other. Despite the loose story-line, we end up caring about the characters. ""Ex-Major"" Reacher (Cruise) is drawn back into action, when he discovers that his replacement Major Turner (Smulders) has been imprisoned in Army jail. Two of her officers she sent on mission to Iraq were murdered. He also discovers the possibility of having a long lost daughter, Sam. Reacher does some digging. Consequences escalate, and soon he is forced to rescue Turner. Now they must uncover the cloaked conspiracy. They are on the run from both the authorities and The Hunter (Heusinger), who is paid to silence them. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is fun and delivers the goods. Cruise holds up his action star end, and does his best. Smulders is great. She has genuine star quality. Too bad Zwick doesn't craft a compelling or touching story to tell. In a way this is disappointing for Cruise and Smulders, and really us as well.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
82,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A film series that I will not likely return to.,5,8 March 2019,"The follow-up sequel to Jack Reacher (2012), Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016) is almost a warning to the audience in the title alone. I understand how a long-running book series like the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child is advantageous for the author by allowing the reader to pick up any book in the series and not need the background of the previous titles. However, with these self-encapsulated scenarios, Jack Reacher is probably better aligned with a television series than a series of movies. Not everyone can be the James Bond series, which has been able to get away with this for as long as it has.Don't get me wrong, I liked the original Jack Reacher movie, as it seemed to channel the ""man with no name"" / high-plains drifter / Ronin style that was prevalent in Westerns and Samurai films. His skills and calm demeanor unquestionably imply military training, but now that Never Go Back has returned them to those roots, it feels less impactful. Sure, there's still the requisite fight sequences and car chases, but they just feel like the standard checklist trappings of an action film instead of an exceptional experience.Having read the first book in the Jack Reacher series, I also have some problems with how the movie's portrayal of the main character. The first movie did OK in creating this mythical man who always seemed to know what to do and where to go (somewhat along the lines of John Wick (2014)). This movie seemed to add in so many side plots and distractions that I never quite knew what Reacher (Tom Cruise) was going to handle next. Perhaps the dissociation between the book and movie versions of the character also has to do with trying to maintain a PG-13 rating for a character who clearly does R-rated things.A film series that I will not likely return to, I give Jack Reacher: Never Go Back 2.5 stars out of 5.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
83,Anurag-Shetty,Another successful action movie franchise for Tom Cruise.,9,29 October 2016,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is based on the novel, Never Go Back by Lee Child. It continues with the adventures of ex-military officer, Jack Reacher(Tom Cruise). Reacher finds out about a massive government scandal, that makes him a fugitive from justice. Now, it is up to Reacher to find out the truth & clear his name. Reacher also uncovers another secret, that could alter the course of his life, forever. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a brilliant film. Director Edward Zwick has successfully taken over the reins from Jack Reacher(2012) director, Christopher McQuarrie. This movie is as entertaining as its predecessor. The action sequences are more intense & thrilling. The highlight of the film is the climax, which takes place at a Halloween parade. Though both this movie & the 2012 original are equally good, if I had to choose, I like the sequel better. A note on the performances. Tom Cruise is spectacular as Jack Reacher. Cruise tones down his natural charm & charisma, due to the intense character he's portraying. Don't worry though. There are a lot of witty one-liners in the film, that Cruise says with just the right amount of sarcasm & nonchalance. Cobie Smulders is superb as Turner. Smulders shines in her first lead role, in a blockbuster. Aldis Hodge is great as Espin. Danika Yarosh is outstanding as Samantha. Cruise & Yarosh, share a very warm chemistry & natural camaraderie in the movie. Patrick Heusinger is awesome as The Hunter. Holt McCallany is impressive as Col. Morgan. Madalyn Horcher is good as Sgt. Leach. Robert Catrini is effective as Col. Moorcroft. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a must watch for all action film buffs & Tom Cruise fans. Make way, Bond, Bourne & Hunt. We have a new spy in town & he's here to stay!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
84,bankofmarquis,Good Enough,6,26 October 2016,"The good and the bad of the new Tom Cruise action flick JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK is that the movie is good enough.Tom Cruise as former Army Major Jack Reacher?  It's not his best performance, nor is it his worst.  It's good enough.The supporting cast of Cobie Smulders, Aldis Hodge, Robert Knepper, Danika Yarosh and Patrick Heusinger?  They are good enough, if a bit ""B"" grade (kind of like seeing the road company of a Broadway musical, I'm sure it would have been better with the original Broadway cast).The action, fights, chases and shootouts?  Good enough.  Nothing exciting or innovative, but professionally done and entertaining enough.The direction by Edward Zick?  Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad, so...you got it...good enough.The plot - good enough for an action thriller, though the twists were telegraphed well before they occurred and I had a tough time identifying with the weariness of the character.  It seemed like this should have been about the 7th movie of a series, not the 2nd.  This can be traced back to this plot being lifted from the 18th Jack Reacher novel (if I counted correctly).  This movie (and the movie ""series"", if you can call 2 movies a ""series) don't earn the ""world weariness"" aspects of the character.Add all that up and it makes for an enjoyable enough - if forgettable - time at the movies.6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
85,fernandoschiavi,"Totally a cliché of the gender, Never Go Back is as good as the first Jack Reacher, maintaining the same quality in every way, but now with greater depth in the characters",6,20 September 2020,"In addition to the name of star Tom Cruise at the head of the entire production, the film had a climate of suspense and action that seemed to emulate those of the thrillers of the 70s a little and brought curiosity to director Werner Herzog as a sinister villain. Despite this, the reception of the film was not as expected and the possibility of a continuation started to raise doubts. However, the box office in the rest of the world turned out to be satisfactory and a sequence was approved. With Christopher McQuirre now only as a producer, the command passes to the competent Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond (2006), Glory (1989), Legends of the Fall (1994)) and who had previously worked with Cruise on The Last Samurai (2003), who adapts the 18th book in the Jack Reacher series, by author Lee Child. Because we are talking about an action movie in the style of hundreds of others that we see out there, from 007 to Assassin at Fixed Price, the work does not require prior knowledge of the character, since everything we need to know is already more than exposed in your script. Despite falling into old clichés and bringing absolutely nothing new, the feature film stands out for some points that are out of the ordinary when it comes to other productions of the genre.The plot revolves around Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a former major (something that is ceaselessly repeated throughout the film), who ends up having to free an army officer, Major Turner (Cobie Smulders), from a conspiracy within the organization that ends up putting it in military prison. Pursued by the military police and a group of mercenaries, the two must get to the bottom of this mystery in order to finally be free. In the midst of it all, Reacher discovers that he possibly has a daughter, Samantha (Danika Yarosh), and she soon becomes another target for the people who hunt them.The script for this sequence, written by Zwick himself with Richard Wenk and Marshall Herskovitz tries to humanize the protagonist and, as a consequence, loses exactly the element that makes the first one fun: his visceral side. To complicate matters, this continuation sounds generic and the clichés multiply with each scene. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" fulfills its function of entertainment and is correct, but does not enhance or enhance the previous film (on the contrary), and this is what a sequel should do. We do not see any major reversal here that is not predictable and, in fact, the text, for the most part, dispenses with this feature, admitting exactly its condition: that of an action film made exactly for those who want to have a relaxed experience in the cinema.Quite different from the first film, which carries a whole investigative air, with the cold of suspense and the charm of epiphanies at crucial moments, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is attached to the human side of the ex-major and investigator of the American army, and the pace is characterized by escapes and violent encounters after trials. Interspersing all this, we have internal conflicts in the trio of fugitives. The first big difference from The Last Shot for Never Go Back is the fact that Reacher now needs to learn to deal with two situations that he is not used to: the first one is to work as a team or with a partner, since Turner is practically a Jack Female Reacher. The second situation is the character's ""cold"" character, which was mitigated by the script that tries to humanize him more and create unnecessary subplots like his relationship with the alleged daughter, which reduces the intensity that the film could carry. The key point of the script is the suspense, regarding the true explanation of the facts unfavorable to Major Turner. When everything makes sense, there is a lack of creativity in the plot, quite standard in the action suspense subgenre and without any intelligence. Nevertheless, the chance to go further was there.
The script mentions misogynist in the army, the topic is faced, but the confrontation succumbs in the face of Reacher's unwavering power. Once again, the woman is seen as fragile, vulnerable and powerless. The protagonist's loneliness is also present, again in a shallow way. The comic relief, always punctual, does not eclipse the unpalatable exaggerations, also punctual (especially in the plane scene). The protagonist's attempt to humanize was a good idea, however, very poorly executed. It is beneficial that he has a daughter, but his insertion in the narrative is artificial, compelling and uncomfortable. In addition, several holes are clear and annoying: It is hard to believe that an experienced military and rule-following like Turner does not know in advance that the army would block their access to the system and their email. In the same way, the whole justification of Sam's mother's lawsuit against Reacher doesn't make much sense, after all she had never even seen him (in fact, the book provides a better explanation, but in the film it is incoherent). It also displays some obvious developments. The scene in which Turner teaches Sam how to get rid of a captor if taken hostage makes it clear that he will be inevitably captured by the villains and will use the coup to get out of a complicated situation (which obviously happens).With a very conventional tone, Edward Zwick delivers a bureaucratic cadence film, with punctual and reasonably competent action scenes, but without daring or trying to create any memorable sequence, a curious shyness for a director who has made more ambitious films in the past, including Cruise himself, as in ""The Last Samurai"". What the work gets right, while many others fail, are its most agitated scenes. The filmmaker gives us frames that do not confuse us, allowing us to see what is happening in each fight or chase. Despite the countless cuts, there is a clear clarity of what is happening on the screen, enabling a greater use of the film as a whole. Unfortunately, many of these sequences end up being too long or repetitive.The film is effective in creating the impression that the protagonists are cornered and that there is a real danger about them. That didn't happen at first, when Reacher always seemed to be ahead of his opponents to the point that nothing they did sounded like a threat. There is a constant feeling that they are isolated, with no one to trust except for one another and the only weapon they have is their own cunning. It even creates cool situations in which Reacher's skills in improvising and investigating are constantly being exploited. In addition, the battles reflect the relentless and direct nature of the protagonist, who always moves to inflict as much damage as possible on his enemies and benefits from the fact that Cruise does most of his action scenes.Tom Cruise is charismatic and full of energy as usual, bringing intensity and Reacher, a man who does not seem to be able, although he clearly wants to, show affection for his daughter and always seems to approach everything with an excessively pragmatic look. Cobie Smulders makes Major Turner a tough military, but with a strict moral code that does not welcome the way Reacher constantly takes the law into his own hands. She is also as capable and resourceful as Reacher, but he (and the film itself) seems to treat her more as an underling than an equal. Okay, she calls Reacher's attention to her behavior, but he still treats her with some condescension and the narrative itself leaves her more of an assistant than a partner, even though this story is more hers than his. Sam helps bring a more human side to the protagonist and benefits from the good chemistry he has with both Smulders and Cruise.Jack Reacher: Never Go Back has some good action scenes, highlighting the final scenes involving a walking chase through the streets and over the roofs of houses in the middle of a street festival. However, the way the narrative develops is quite dull, full of coincidences and meaningless situations to justify the next shooting, which are, unsurprisingly, the best moments of the work. Highlight for the soundtrack of the Englishman Henry Jackman (Kingsman: Secret Service) that brings moments of pure energy with others more emotional.Overall, Never Go Back is as good as the first Jack Reacher, maintaining the same quality in every way, but now with greater depth in the characters, especially in Reacher. For some it will be more of a cliché film, which is not a lie, but everything is executed with a good quality and keeps the public's interest. The big problem of the film is not to leave the same and more, and to be so generic leaving the feeling that you are watching a sequel that cannot be justified. Everything in the film seems just a jumble of scenes and situations seen in dozens of other similar films, even following the predictable order of events. Without surprises or anything that makes it at least relevant, ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is a film that does not bother, but neither marks, and this is the worst defect of the work.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
86,dave-mcclain,"""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" isn't just a title - it's good advice.",2,21 October 2016,"What's a former U.S. Army military police major to do after leaving the service? Well, if your name is Jack Reacher, wander around the country, drift through life, get work where you can and occasionally resurface when there is a wrong to be righted, especially when a soldier is wrongly accused of a crime. Jack Reacher is a character created by British author Lee Child, who has written over 20 novels featuring the character. Child's ninth Reacher book, ""One Shot"", was the first one adapted to the big screen and became the film ""Jack Reacher"", released in 2012. That film turned a modest profit at the domestic box office, and then ended up pulling in over $218 million, counting international box office receipts. That final tally made a sequel all but inevitable, especially given the abundance of source material from which to choose. For the series' second installment, Paramount Pictures went back to Child's series, adapted his 18th Reacher novel, put the character's name in front of the title and gave Movie Fans ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (PG-13, 1:58). Turns out, for Movie Fans, that title makes for some pretty good advice.Played again by Tom Cruise, Jack Reacher's mission of righting wrongs, especially when current or former military members are involved, brings him into contact with Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders), the officer who is currently in command of Reacher's former MP battalion. When Reacher drifts in to Washington, D.C. to meet Turner face-to-face, he finds that she has been arrested – for espionage. He springs her from jail and learns that her arrest seems to be related to the recent deaths of two of her soldiers whom she had sent to Afghanistan to investigate possible illegal sales of U.S. arms.Reacher is soon pulled into this case in ways that even he couldn't have predicted. Helping Turner puts a target on his back and he is soon framed for murder as an excuse for the bad guys to pursue him too. He also finds out along the way that a woman whom he isn't sure that he even remembers has a paternity case pending against him. That woman's 15-year-old daughter, Samantha (Danika Yarosh), is now also in danger because of her connection with Reacher. That leaves Reacher, Turner and young Samantha on the run from a variety of current and former military members, many of whose real motives are unclear.In spite of a few cool scenes, watching this film is an exercise in frustration for Movie Fans who like good action movies, crime dramas, or even 2012's ""Jack Reacher"". Co-written and directed by Edward Zwick, best known for movies with heroic military figures (such as ""Glory"", ""Courage Under Fire"" and Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai""), uncharacteristically ""reaches"" too far with this movie. The situations in which the characters find themselves feel forced and the characters themselves don't talk or act like real people (much less like real military people, according to our staff member with military experience). The majority of the active duty and former soldiers portrayed in this movie freely violate Army values like loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor and integrity – and they can't even pronounce well-known places like Bagram correctly! As a sign of the story's lack of realism and the overwhelmingly negative portrayal of the Army as a whole, there is no Department of Defense involvement noted in the closing credits. What the credits do give us is a reminder of how audiences should react in case there's another film in this franchise – ""Never Go Back"". This Jack Reacher sequel gets a ""C-"".",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
87,swilliky,Another poor 2016 sequel for a middling film franchise,4,20 October 2016,"Continuing the year of inferior sequels, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back comes along to lower the bar on an already middling film series. I haven't read any of Lee Child's books but wonder why they decided on this particular storyline to pick up from the novels and adapt as another Tom Cruise film. The story offers very little in action with a few forced fights that don't fit well into the plot and felt overly stage under Edward Zwick's direction.One of the better parts of the film was to see Colbie Smulders spreading out her career beyond the Marvel Cinematic Universe to play Major Turner. Turner and Reacher strike up a conversation after Jack helps nail a sheriff who was capturing and selling undocumented immigrants. The movie never pushes any political issues with a brief subplot of heroin smuggling and only a shrugging mention of the war in Afghanistan. When Smulders's Turner ends up in jail, Reacher begins his investigation punching thugs in the face and being falsely confused.

89,jrarichards,Few surprises here ... except maybe in the above-average character interplay,7,6 July 2018,"This review comes from someone who has jumped straight to the second film, without ever seeing the first. In this ""Never Go Back"" instalment, Director Edward Zwick brings Tom Cruise back as Reacher - this time as an ""ex-military"" version of the hero penned into existence by British (no not American) writer Lee Child (who neatly takes a minor role in the movie!) And this work adds further weight to the idea that ""ex-military"" mostly seems a bit of a contradiction in terms (just like ""ex-CIA"", for that matter). Indeed, its ""ex military"" that Reacher is now also up against, given that our enemies here are those chief bogeymen since the 1990s - private defence/security contractors. You know, the people that Eisenhower warned us about in 1961, the people working in businesses of the kind that enriched a former Vice President of the USA, the people that Harvard's Prof. Michael Sandel likes to home in on when he asks: when did the American people ever give permission for their wars to be fought - or at least mopped up - by the private sector? Those kinds of people.Anyway, there's plenty of whizz-bang stuff here, violence aplenty with ""crunchy"" sound effects (yes, really), and none of it looks especially real-life, or indeed worthwhile, except maybe to keep us on our toes in wondering what those private-sector military are up to, on their own, or when they hook up with the military proper. This chunk of the wider military-industrial complex is not pretty, as it's portrayed here as black ops, devious, with fingers in every pie, casual about human life, keen to make money at all costs, and so on.So no real surprises there...Indeed, one might pretty much say that's all there is to the rather unoriginal work that is ""Never Go Back"" ... and bye-bye. This is not quite so, however, given the dynamics and interest of a kind of ""impromptu family on the run in a road movie gone wrong"" that appears for much of the film, thanks to a deliciously hot Cobie Smulders as Major Turner, Reacher himself, and sassy teen Samantha played by Danika Yarosh. Cruise is more or less his usual character here (love it or hate it, I mostly love it), but Smulders is classy and plays a more-than-one-dimensional role, while Yarosh is far, far better than we have any right to expect. Indeed, the extremely patient viewer rounded enough to be interested in various aspects of this movie beyond the ""bangs for the bucks"" will have a fine cinematic treat in store with a final scene played out between Yarosh and Cruise. So genuine and well done (and touchingly thought-provoking) is this that it delivered the tears to my (father-of-a daughter) eyes within moments, and it also segued beautifully into some touching music from British composer Henry Jackman. Now what to say about a film that scores best where you don't expect it, and is best of all in its - entirely untypical - last 3 minutes? For this reason, enigmatic to say the least, I've gone for a 7 here. Call me crazy if you will...",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
90,bob-the-movie-man,OK... just OK,6,8 November 2016,"I'm a big fan of Tom Cruise. He is a real old-fashioned film star, generous with his fans on the red carpet and with real star power at the box office. And I can happily sit down in front of just about any one of his DVD's time and time again and still enjoy it. Unlike many critics, I even enjoyed his last outing as Jack Reacher.Unfortunately, and it pains me to say this but, his latest outing - ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" - is a bit dull.Lee Child's Reacher has many years before turned his back on his military past and wanders the country as a drifter righting wrongs outside of the law. In this film, his military past again makes a major (""No, ex-Major"") intrusion into his life. Potential love interest Major Susan Turner (Colbie Smulders, from the ""Avengers"" world) is arrested on trumped-up espionage charges and Cruise sets out to clear her name. Along the way he accidentally (and rather too conveniently for the plot) discovers that a paternity suit has been filed against him and Reacher confronts the rebellious and light-fingered teenager Samantha (Danika Yarosh, aged 18 playing 15).Unfortunately the big-cheeses involved in the international arms skulduggery are determined to tie up each and every loose end in their intrigue, and that includes Reacher, Turner and young Samantha by association. Needless to say, the villains - led by a one-man killing machine (Patrick Heusinger) - haven't counted on Reacher's 'particular set of skills'.My problem with the film (after an entertaining opening) is that the screenplay lumbers from standard thriller set-piece to standard thriller set-piece in a highly predictable way. It's as if the scripts from 20 different films have been stuck in a blender. Shadowy arms dealing shenanigans: check; Cute teenager in peril: check; Gun fight on a dockside: check; Rooftop chase: check.Are all the individual set-pieces decently done? Yes, sure. But the combination of these bits of action tapas really don't add up to a satisfying meal. The story arc is almost non-existent as there is no suspense in the 'investigation': the plot is all pretty well laid out for you. Where there is some fun to be had is in the play-off between the born- leader Reacher and the born-leader Turner, both trying to be top-dog in the decision making. The romantic connection between the leads seems almost plausible despite their 20 (TWENTY!) year age difference: this is more down to how incredibly good Cruise still looks at age 54 (damn him!). Turner makes a good female role-model right up to the point where there is a confrontation in a hotel room and Turner backs down: despite Cruise being the ""hero"" it would have been nice for female equality for this face-off to have gone the other way.The director is Edward Zwick, who helmed Cruise's more interesting movie ""The Last Samurai"".The trailer started off well and then progressed into general mediocrity.

On the run as a fugitive from the law, Reacher uncovers a potential secret from his past that could change his life forever Never give in, never give up, never go back.Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the sequel to 2012's Jack Reacher; both movies are based on the popular books by Lee Child. Like the first, this is a Tom Cruise thriller, so there's plenty of edge-of-your-seat action. Reacher is a one-man wrecking crew who leaves a trail of broken bodies.Characters get shot, and are beaten to death. The fight scenes, especially the bone- snapping endings can be pretty intense.It's mostly hand-to-hand, but they're fast and high-impact.I'll skip over the rest of the plot, except to say that the filmmakers have concocted a counter-Reacher called the Hunter (Patrick Heusinger), a soldier who left the service but realized he ""can never go back to the world."" (""Never go back"" — get it?) Now he shoots and beats people to death for rich employers. Reacher picks up the Hunter's tail, which isn't too difficult since he's dressed in black with black gloves and might as well be wearing a name tag saying, my name is: ASSASSIN. This is another of those movies in which the tough bad guy is always trying to tell the tough good guy how much alike they are so the good guy can say something to the effect that they're nothing alike as he puts a spike through the bad guy's neck or pushes him off a skyscraper. Which is not what happens here. .But despite of all this, i thought it was very entertaining and recommend it to any action lover to go and see this movie. It's a good film that keeps the viewer entertained on budget of 60 mill I could talk all day about the pros and cons of action film not a sequel as one shot was the 6th book and this is 18th in jack reacher you will find everything you need to know in the first few scenes we open at a diner where people are explaining what happened to the 4 men on the ground one guy beat them up he is inside the diner calmly eating his food it says a lot about tom cruise action dude persona put to good use in his recent hits like edge of tomorrow and m I p and that he doesn't even have to be seen to be doing bad-ass things to seem bad-ass at all it's a powerful pedigree along with cruise on screen charm and intensity that makes this such a success of Dir ed film there is plenty of kicking ass that you wont be disappointed with the plot is courtesy of lee child thank god its not Dan brown this film will keep you interested for the 2hrs it centers around a murder of 2 us army soldiers in Afghanistan a crime for which reacher current crush major Susan Turner (cobie smulders) has been arrested for when reacher tries to help he ends up back in the army and implicated in the murder so after breaking out of jail the pair go on the run cruise style the bad guys never give up and cruise is joined by SAM ( danika yarosh a feisty 15 yr old who thinks she is his daughter regardless of how many times he insists that the girl isn't his SAM is a targeted by the baddies but with a conspiracy by the army about missing tech form Afghanistan here Cruise and his feisty leading ladies and support are well capable but this film is has a nice with a heart of kick ass and feisty lady kicks. This is my 6 cruise film in a row in the cinema Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a brilliant film. Director Edward Zwick has successfully taken over the reins from Jack Reacher(2012) director, Christopher McQuarrie. This movie is as entertaining as its predecessor. The action sequences are more intense & thrilling. The highlight of the film is the climax, which takes place at a Halloween parade. Though both this movie & the 2012 original are equally good, if I had to choose, I like the sequel better. A note on the performances. Tom Cruise is spectacular as Jack Reacher. Cruise tones down his natural charm & charisma, due to the intense character he's portraying. Don't worry though. There are a lot of witty one-liners in the film, that Cruise says with just the right amount of sarcasm & nonchalance. Cobie Smulders is superb as Turner. Smulders shines in her first lead role, in a blockbuster. Aldis Hodge is great as Espin. Danika Yarosh is outstanding as Samantha. Cruise & Yarosh, share a very warm chemistry & natural camaraderie in the movie cruise likes his women to kick butt. Patrick Heusinger is awesome as The Hunter. Holt McCallany is impressive as Col. Morgan. Madalyn Horcher is good as Sgt. Leach. Robert Catrini is effective as Col. Moorcroft. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a must watch for all action film buffs & Tom Cruise fans. Make way, Bond, Bourne & Hunt. We have a new spy in town & he's here to stay!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
94,brankovranjkovic,Jack Reacher - Never Go Back ... Please ... Never Ever Go Back,2,21 October 2016,"I remember the first film being relatively competent, so anticipated another relatively enjoyable sequel, although the title should give you a clue, and maybe should have been more accurately titled 'Don't Bother Going' instead of 'Never Go Back'.The script was mediocre, there was no real chemistry between Reacher and the other characters, and especially with his (big spoiler) supposed 15 year-old daughter, who pops out of nowhere.While it has its moments, this is nothing more than a formula action flick, full of clichés and lame dialogue. There's a total of three or four very short action sequences throughout the whole film.I'll keep it short because there's no need to waste more time thinking about this, I've watched this and have warned you so that you don't have to waste your time and money.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
95,griffolyon12,Better Than the First,9,8 November 2016,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back features Tom Cruise once more in the role from Lee Child's bestselling book series. A former MP turned vigilante drifter, Reacher is once again drawn into a game of political intrigue when his successor in Washington, Major Turner (played with kick butt awesomeness by Cobie Smulders), is falsely accused of treason. Like the first Jack Reacher movie, there are twists, fist fights, and shootouts galore, however unlike the first movie, Never Go Back has a much tauter story. There are less plot holes in Never Go Back than there were in the first Jack Reacher movie, and that is what makes this one the better of the two. While director Edward Zwick does a good job directing the action, the movie doesn't necessarily do anything new in the action/thriller genre, but it does what one expects of a movie like this exceedingly better than pretty much any other action movie in recent memory.I give Jack Reacher: Never Go Back a 9 out of 10!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
96,Laakbaar,"A ""massflames"" movie",7,30 December 2016,"This movie falls into a genre of action film that you see a lot of lately. Same as the Bourne movies or latest Bond films really. ""Safe House"" is also in this genre.In these movies there is always an elite military unit or security agency involved. The agents often have superhuman intellectual and physical abilities, far beyond that of trained athletes and martial arts experts. They jump from roof to roof, get injured in the knee, smash their heads against doors, and yet press on. They all fight like Bruce Lee nowadays.They can fly helicopters, drive like stunt men, do daredevil tricks with motorcycles. They have superb memories, training in explosives, knowledge on how to disarm nuclear weapons. These people -- even the lawyers, apparently -- are not only highly trained, super fit, super smart sharpshooters trained in martial arts to an unearthly level, they're also sort of invulnerable. They're superheros really.And of course there's always a rogue element: it's always the case that someone has become, will become, or is suspected of being, not what he seems. The viewer is invited in virtually every film to try to figure out the twist. You can't trust anyone, can you. It's almost a rule now. Nothing is as it seems.These films are a combination of the ""Spy"" and ""Superhero"" or ""Martial Arts"" genre, but with ""Science Fiction"" high technology thrown in. And the rogue element has some of the ""Mystery"" genre in it. Also, in these American films there are almost always intense shoot outs and chase scenes. Everything happens very fast. Lots of crazy driving, crashes and near death escapes. That makes them ""Action"" films. And of course they're shot in ""Exotic Locations"" So let's rearrange the initials of all these genres to call this the ""MASSFLAMES"" genre. Every other movie seems to be like this nowadays. It sells.Anyway, this is that kind of movie. It was competently done. I didn't hate the movie so I don't want to give it a 6. It had a few visceral pleasures. If you're a teenage boy, you'll enjoy this movie. Although you could also just go to another ""massflames"" movie. They're all the same really. Maybe that's the point?I like Cobie Smulders, and she was good here. Cruise too, I guess. To be honest, I would have a hard time telling Jack Reacher apart from Ethan Hunt.I have to admit though that the kung-fu battles, shootouts and car chases turned me off.I didn't really care what happened to any of the characters.

The plot is an easy one to understand and one that keeps you in suspense throughout. But I just had some issues with it, which stops it being the level the first film was at.So a big part of this film is the whole ""daughter"" thing and I just didn't vibe with it. I just didn't fit the Jack Reacher character and that was quite visible throughout. The daughter character as well I didn't understand. At the beginning she's made out to be this hardcore, doesn't listen to anyone teen. But her character completely switches with the flick of a switch and she's this nice, compassionate girl. I just didn't get the immediate switch. The plot itself didn't really have any sort of twist that the first one had. It was a lot more linear and expected. As mentioned it does keep you in suspense, but nothing more. I thought the ending was a little dragged out as well. We knew what the outcome would be a good half an hour before and it would just add another fight in there. And another one. And another one.

LOL Edward Zwick (""Glory"", ""Legends of the Fall"", etc..), who previously directed Tom in ""The Last Samurai"", is at the helm this time around, and he does pretty much an adequate job of keeping your interest throughout this; along with Cruise's interpretation of the Jack Reacher character from the novels. I liked some things enough about the first film, from 2012, but not enough to recommend it. This one, based on the novel ""Never Go Back"", just tips itself over the top enough for me to recommend giving it a watch. Cobie Smulders (""How I Met Your Mother"", ""The Avengers"", etc..) is quite good as our film's heroine, as well as the young actress playing the character who may or may not be Reacher's biological daughter. I noticed the first film didn't do that well at the box office domestically anyways, but did a decent amount of worldwide business for them to go ahead with this sequel.

103,EthanBJones_03,One word; Average,5,20 January 2017,"Overall: This movie is just average and I cannot really recommend it. Maybe one night... in the background at a party... while your drunk.Good: The action was actually pretty good and Jack Reacher's witty persona, which I enjoyed in the first movie, is back! Tom Cruise's performance was surprisingly very mixed. He had some good moments and some terrible moments. For his calibre of actor, that is very disappointing. The villains were massively improved with the assassin/ex-military guy providing a fierce competition for Reacher with Robert Knepper as the cool, collected leader. Literally the only improvement over the first one sadly. Bad: Very surprisingly, Tom Cruise's acting was sub par for frequent sections of the movie. All the rest of the acting was just on par with his at these moments. Nothing impressed me or made me even care. The humour in this movie felt so forced and just didn't flow like in the original. It worked in the original because it felt like it worked and wasn't overdone. In this movie however, it is overdone, over exaggerated and overly stupid. Providing a love interest for Reacher(whether that be in the original books I do not care) and his 'child' was so god damn moronic it made me want the villains to catch her. The movie never gave me an excuse to comprehend caring about any characters and I honestly wouldn't have flinched if everyone died. ​ Speaking of his child and lover, this movie nails a string of clichés such as: 'Girl and Guy hate each other at first', 'child runs over to hug parent after leaving', 'bad guys nearly always miss', 'bad guy targets heroes family' and so many more. It is annoying that this movie is done so lazily and, compared to the original which I actually enjoyed, it just went down in pretty much every way. The cinematography was also lazy and contained too many stupid shots and shaky cam. The music was there and didn't affect me in anyway what so ever. Also the decent bits of the movie were in the trailer.Best Part: The action scene at the end of the movie.MVP: Patrick Heusinger(maybe?) as the assassin hunting them down5/10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
104,Magow-Intermean,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back Review,10,23 March 2019,"When Major Turner (Cobie Smulders), Reacher's (Tom Cruise) successor in the Military Police, is arrested for espionage, he starts poking around. When he's then framed for murder, he busts her out and they set out to clear their names.Sure, he's a fine actor, but what Tom Cruise does really well is run. And Ed Zwick, having directed him before, clearly knows that. So, as Never Go Back approaches the half-hour mark and with Cruise yet to break into anything above a brisk walk, Zwick cuts to him sprinting for a cab. And then, to make up for lost time presumably, a few minutes later he runs for a bus. He may be 54 now (and it's not quite him trying to outrun a sandstorm), but watching Cruise run has lost none of its thrill.Of course that is, technically, another stick with which doubters can beat this cinematic Reacher, should they be so inclined. Book Reacher's lumbering lack of speed is a rare weakness and is brought up semi-regularly, but clearly it's not an issue here. (Even though he does miss that bus.) But it feels, two movies in, as though it's time to make peace. For better or worse, taller or shorter, when it comes to cinematic Reacher, Cruise is our man.
And (despite all that running) there is good news. Zwick here takes Reacher closer to the books - tougher, gruffer and no longer boasting the skills of a stunt-car driver. (At least, not that we're shown.) In fact, he's usually in the passenger seat. The opening scene, which sees police arrive at a diner with four bodies writhing in agony on the car park floor, and Reacher calmly sitting inside drinking his coffee, is a perfect example - an Indiana Jones-style end-of-the-last-adventure vignette that immediately sets the scene for this grittier vision. We're not in the same territory in terms of stylistic differences as Mission: Impossible and its immediate sequel - there are no slo-mo doves here - but it's still a noticeably different beast.The stakes are higher here than in Jack Reacher - he's framed for murder after poking around in the arrest of Turner (Smulders), the major who's doing his old job in the Military Police. She's been accused of espionage, but Reacher senses something's afoot (which his arrest proves), so he breaks them both out of prison and they go on the run, closely followed by hitmen determined to stop them. Plus there's an added wrinkle: 15-year-old Samantha (Danika Yarosh), a girl Reacher's only just found out about, who may or may not be his daughter, is also caught in the firing line. Cue familial-style bickering between the three.
According to Lee Child, the presence of Samantha in Never Go Back is one of the main reasons this story was chosen, and it's an interesting addition in terms of Reacher's character development - will the drifter find an anchor? Sure, it took 18 books of wandering for this particular paternity issue to come up and we're only on film two, but it's not without precedent - the issue of settling down was raised as early as book three when Reacher inherited a house (he decided against it).Reacher's also drafted back into the army after a clause in his release papers is activated, allowing them (rather than the police) to hold him for the murder he's accused of. This sets up some soul-searching about whether someone like him can ever have a normal life, and brings up the question about why he left in the first place. ""Let's just say, I woke one morning and the uniform didn't fit,"" he tells Turner.
But where Never Goes Back does fall short in comparison with Jack Reacher, despite the lower stakes, is the central mystery. One Shot, the book the first film is based on, boasted one of the best (if not the best) of the entire series. Never Go Back does not. Recognising that, much here has been changed from the source material. Some necessary (the book fizzles out whereas this builds to a final showdown), some just different - no LA, as soon as the trio leave DC they head to party town New Orleans, where the finale just happens to coincide with the annual Hallowe'en parade. But the murky machinations of the arms-dealing still can't compete with the purity of the original's sniper mystery. Next time it would be wise to choose one of the better-plotted books - Killing Floor or Bad Luck And Trouble perhaps.And it looks likely there will be a next time. This is only the second instance where Tom Cruise has committed to a sequel, and presumably it's with eyes on a long-running franchise. With M:I it took him three movies to nail the tone and formula; with Reacher he's managed it a film earlier.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

106,Ramascreen,JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK is like an understudy of other action thrillers that are way better and more well structured,4,19 October 2016,"JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK is round two of Tom Cruise running and punching and running some more. Makes you wonder what happens if brute and fists aren't enough to get the job done. This sequel feels like something that Liam Neeson often does; another Oscar nominated actor who, just like Cruse, doesn't want to go do meaningful roles like old times. So it's either this or being in a sleek team like Mission Impossible for Cruise, 'cause you won't see him wearing superhero spandex ever.JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK reunites Tom Cruise with his ""The Last Samurai"" director, one of my favorite filmmakers, Edward Zwick. Based on Lee Child's novel, when Cobie Smulder's Army Major Susan Turner, who heads Reacher's old investigative unit, is arrested for treason, Reacher will stop at noting to prove her innocence. But in the process, he too gets framed and hunted down while he's trying to uncover a major government conspiracy that caused the deaths of two soldiers.Even if you haven't read the book, you can sense, while watching this film, it's as if many parts that should've been there, just aren't there, or have been taken out. And some of the brutal fist fights don't come naturally, meaning instead of it being part of the plot, they seem to stage it just so there could be a fist fight for you. And although Cobie Smulder's character tries to inject some kind of anti-sexism girl power, the writers still at the end of the day put her in a position behind Reacher, because in this film, it's still a man's world. This is an action film with a main goal to solely make Tom Cruise look good, everything else be damned. Even Danika Yarosh's petulant teenage character couldn't get us the audience to sympathize with her ordeal. Or perhaps the problem is in the novel, because after all, the twist/reveal of the government conspiracy is neither anything new nor clever.

107,TheHonestCritic,"The title of this ""film"" serves as a serious warning.",4,28 February 2021,"""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016), following the unexpected surprise of the first movie, I did not expect a sequel to be made. ""Jack Reacher"" (2012) was an absolutely amazing film, to say the least. It had a complete storyline and you left the movie totally satisfied and without wanting anymore. Two years later, there were no announcements regarding any ""Jack Reacher"" sequels. I thought: ""all right, it's no big deal. At this point, we don't need any followup films."" In most cases, it's around one to three years between film releases in a franchise. But about a year after that, ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" was announced to be in production. Needless to say, I was a little surprised to hear about that. But, I just thought to myself: ""how bad can it be?"" I went to go see it in the theater, and I was very disappointed with it. This ""film"" has a dull and cliched storyline, average to terrible acting, and a boring soundtrack. The storyline is, Jack Reacher and a framed Army major reveal a dark conspiracy. Let me tell you something, it is just as boring as it sounds. This ""movie"" may be 12 minutes shorter than the first one, but it honestly feels so much longer. Even though it isn't! There's even a sub-plot going on where it's assumed that Jack Reacher has a daughter, played by Danika Yarosh. As you can imagine, that plot goes absolutely nowhere and amounts to nothing. The idea for the main storyline is somewhat interesting, I just wish it was more heavily focused on. Keep in mind, this ""film"" has three writers. That's right, it has three of them and the first movie had only one. Yet, a team of three script writers couldn't come up with a good story? Wow, that's pretty bad when a solo writer comes up with a better script than a team of three! The only good thing in this ""film"" are the action scenes. Most of them were actually pretty good, but action scenes are no substitute for poorly written screenplays. As I've said many times, action scenes have to be earned from the result of a great plot line. If the story is bad, then the action scenes will mean nothing. You might see action scenes happening, but you don't experience them. Another issue is that the storyline is marred by the questionable daughter sub-plot. That part should have just been written out of the ""film"" altogether, and then it may have been more on the right track. Sadly, we can't have every miracle happen at once with bad writers. As far as the acting goes, it's overall a letdown. The best acting performances in this ""movie"" come from Tom Cruise, Cobie Smulders and Patrick Heusinger. They're the only ones who actually appear to be putting forth some resemblance of effort. Tom Cruise and Cobie Smulders do have decent chemistry on-screen and Patrick Heusinger didn't do too bad as the villain. It just goes to show that the story had potential, but unfortunately, lazy script writing prevented them from giving it their all. That's one of the worst things with bad movies, wasted potential. As for the rest of the acting, it's just average to terrible. You know it has to be bad when even Tom Cruise can't save a bad movie! The soundtrack is nothing short of generic. You can really tell that this film score rushed together at the last second. It does have some good parts, but overall, it's nothing but your pedestrian action movie soundtrack. Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of trash. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are very well-done, which is no surprise, being a film made in 2016. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is a waste of time. Still, to this day, I'm shocked at how bad this ""movie"" turned out to be, such a letdown! I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Bottom line, just stay away from this ""movie"". It will do nothing but disappoint you, especially if you love the first film. Like I said, take the title of this ""movie"" as a warning.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
108,gavinp9,Adequate action flick,6,2 January 2018,"The second Jack Reacher film (based on Lee Child's 18th book, 'Never Go Back') is much the same as the first film - still not as good as the novel, but a serviceable action film nonetheless. I'm not sure why, if they're going to franchise the series, they don't go in chronological order? It takes most of the plot from the book: a Military Police Major, Turner (Smulders) is framed for espionage, so Reacher (Cruise) decides to exonerate her by finding/killing who has set her up.It's amazing Cruise doesn't appear to have aged at all in 4 years! People still hate that he's not the 6 foot-plus hulk from the books, but Cruise brings an intensity to the role, while not always being stony. The difference is that instead of being a loner, he's paired up with Turner and Samantha (Yarosh), so there's three of them on the run, making for a different dynamic that doesn't always work, especially since he's not the most paternal. Since it's a cruise film, there's plenty of running - see above - which even Smulders gets in on!It's certainly not bad - enough hand-to-hand fights and shoot-outs to tick the 'action' box, as well as a bit of a murder-mystery to be solved.

Those who know, don't tell but show - including Tom Cruise who keeps currently not one but two franchises active.The sixth ""Mission: Impossible"" will arrive in July. The second ""Jack Reacher"" reviewed here didn't have much of a box office success - even the first one was struggling, actually. Here's hoping there will come a third one, because I fnd this honestly quite entertaining.It's a little hard to figure out the aim of Jack Reacher series. It's a typical action movie but then again, it's not typical at all. The makers throw out much of the usual genre filler - including on-screen romances, explanations about the world the intriguing character operates in, light humor etc.The emphasis is on tempo and suspense, building and holding of it, and somehow, somewhy, this lean mean approach works, even without spectacular setpieces of ""Mission: Impossible"". At least it works for me.Of course, the Cruiser fancies himself an event actor and larger than life, so every movie starring him must have its fair share of ""Cruise moments"" - mostly shots of him standing, smiling and lurking around in specific way that is instantly recognizable for anyone who has seen his most famous works.""Never Goes Back"" has a good amount of them, especially in the final third. So if you don't stomach or care about Cruise wearing his Cruise-ness loudly and proudly, you will probably have some hard time with enjoying the result.There seems to be even less room for plot development than in the first movie, but they still have time to bring in two intriguing female characters to go alongside the Cruiser.This gives otherwise action-centric movie a short but moving finale, full of Cruise shots, of course, but still.

But in this second screen portrayal, I think Cruise did a much better job of growing into the role. Reacher comes to Virginia to meet Major Turner, whose voice he liked on the phone. He finds that she's been arrested for treason, and of course knows its bogus. This pretty much follows the book. Then the pursuit of the truth leads Reacher to beat up and kill a bunch of bad dudes working for this Army contractor.The acting by Cruise and Smulders as Turner was decent. Anyone expecting a deep mystery in this story would be disappointed. It was pretty clear who was bad and who was good. They brought in this girl would was allegedly Reacher's daughter. I remember the book had her live in LA, but in this version she was right there in Washington. I guess for simplicity. The film also made her a key target of the movie, I guess to add some drama? This plot helped show audiences that Reacher does care about people, whether he knows them or not, as long as they are the good guys.Stuff gets blown up, there are car chases and foot chases, and a lot of shooting and fights. If you like Reacher, this will give you what you wanted. Otherwise, it's not that deep a movie with a pretty simple plot that will leave you asking why people like this character. To answer that question - I suggest you read the books, which are far superior to these first two Reacher movies so far. Enjoy.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The story with Reacher's non daughter is unnecessary except for setting up the final fight. There were better ways to get to the final Reacher vs bad guy muscle fight.Otherwise, the movie is decent - decent action, decent crime solved by Reacher.Note that it's the police in the beginning and the military folks who are the bad guys.

115,darkreignn,I will Never Go Back to watch this movie again,3,20 October 2016,"If you want to see a slow-burn, dramatic, incredibly intense and well-executed action thriller with realistic fight sequences and a cool story, you might as well go watch the first ""Jack Reacher"" film again, because this film was embarrassingly, uncomfortably, painfully bad. And I am not exaggerating. My chest hurt while watching this film. I was actually clutching my chest. It felt like I was having a heart attack, and in fact, having a heart attack would've probably been more entertaining than watching this film.Tom Cruise was good in this film, that's no surprise, he's good in pretty much everything; but every other actor, and I do mean every other actor, was atrocious. I couldn't believe how bad the acting was in this film. And the writing! My God, the writing was absolutely horrendous. There were some lines that made me spew vomit all over the people sitting in front of me from how bad they were. Here is an actual line from the film: ""I'm a stone killer."" Let that sink in. Not a ""stone cold killer"". Not even a ""cold killer"". No, a ""stone killer."" He kills rocks, I guess.And oh man, if you really love your immersion being broke, then you will love the scene where Jack Reacher is on an airplane, because it is THE most obvious set I've ever seen. Why, you ask? Because every single window on the airplane was closed. EVERY SINGLE ONE. There's even a scene where you see the exterior of the airplane flying at night time, and all the windows are open, and then it cuts back to the interior of the plane, and the windows are all closed. Can a set get any more obvious? It was just lazy, cheap filmmaking.Speaking of cheap, this film looked it. It looked like a TV movie that for some reason starred Tom Cruise. The lighting was bland. The sets were so obviously sets that it hurt to watch. The acting was flat and boring. The writing? Stupid. Cringeworthy. The action scenes: horrendous. Generic. Incomprehensible. So much close up shaky cam. You couldn't tell what was happening. Why do directors edit action scenes in this manner? It's not enjoyable if you can't see what's happening. It's like the director watched ""Taken 3"" and ""Jason Bourne"" back to back and was like, ""Yes! That's exactly what I want my action to look like!"" Well, if he wanted to make his action look like visual feces, he succeeded.And I know I keep mentioning the writing, but I cannot reiterate enough how truly awful it was. I was embarrassed to hear the actors recite their lines, and I'm not joking. Have you ever sat in a crowded theatre, heard someone in a movie say, ""I'm a stone killer,"" and hear everyone sitting around you sigh heavily and sink back into their seats? Neither have I, until tonight. There were so many embarrassing lines in this movie that every time Tom Cruise beat someone up on screen I prayed that he would materialize in front of me so he could beat me into a concussion so I could stop subjecting myself to such idiotic dialogue. There's even one point where someone trains someone else to fight, and says something like, ""Now I'm going to teach you how to kick someone in the balls."" At that point I actually started to punch myself in the balls, and with each blow to my own tender testes, I found myself having more pleasure than I was having while watching this movie.However, I will say that one scene was masterfully done. During this scene, Reacher was fighting a man, and proceeded to break his arms, his legs, and his neck. With his neck broken, still breathing, Reacher holds the mans head back, and whispers, ""Look at me."" As the man looks up into Reacher's baby blue eyes, glistening like an angels, Reacher delivers the killing blow, and then throws the dead body off a building. The violence during this scene was brutal, hard to watch, sadistic even. Jack Reacher enjoyed inflicting this pain, and it was almost like the director was asking the audience, ""Is this the man you've been rooting for? This killer?"" And that is clever filmmaking. Unfortunately, this is the only scene in the movie that is smart in any way.Other than that, this film was not good. And I absolutely adore the first ""Jack Reacher."" It's one of my favorite action films.Please, please don't subject yourself to this cinematic torture. Yes, the opening scene is good, but it's all downhill from there. I'm telling you as a friend, you don't want to see this. Just watch the first ""Jack Reacher"" twice if you really need your double dose of Tom Cruise. Or instead just take ten dollars and put it through a shredder. At least it'll be more entertaining, and just as painful, as watching ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.""",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
116,canuckteach,A more sentimental Jack Reacher...?,7,20 October 2016,"Yeah, but... is that what we want? I caught this on opening night up here in Canada, and, now that I am a senior, I get in for 8.50 Cdn$ (approx 4.25USD). At that price, this was a reasonable exercise. Maybe the best scene was the opener: the one (we see in the ads) with the ringing phone in the restaurant, with Reacher and the 2 Sheriffs (one of whom is crooked, or so we are told).After this, Reacher heads to D.C. to try to land a date with a (apparently pretty) military officer he has assisted, but never met. Upon his arrival, he learns that she has been arrested for corruption, or something. Jack has some history at this military base and there is now an allegation that Reacher fathered a daughter 15 years earlier. So, Jack begins 'investigating' the corruption case, the Reacher way. He gets framed too, has to escape from jail with his intended girl friend, elude the bad guys (whom the real police haven't noticed are killing people), and get to know his alleged 'daughter', all in short order. That's a lot for a guy who usually talks less than Jason Bourne.Passable 2nd entry in this series. Missed the dark moodiness of the first one, (and the irreplaceable supporting work of Robert Duvall, of course!).",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
117,Eddie_weinbauer,Paint by numbers and not really good numbers,1,31 December 2016,"Why do they always pick the really really bad reacher books to make into film. I hardly remember the book since it's ages ago since I read it,but I do remember it wasn't very good.The whole story is just very run–of–the–mill.It starts with a couple of guys laying strewn out in a parking lot, outside a diner. You have no idea what happened nor why they are there,or what it got to do with the rest of the movie(absolutely nothing,it turns out)Than reacher travels to DC, to go on a date with a female major hes been talking with over the phone. Than it suddenly he is drafted again and charged with murder. From than on out, there's is very little storyline and mostly a lot of running.The problem with the whole reacher series is,it doesn't transfer very well to film,because it's so generic. It's Dirty Harry,it's charles bronson's death wish. You've seen it all before,the guy that comes out of nowhere and saves the day,than rides into the sunsetSo they had to have a name to sell it on and they chose Tom Cruise,which is a terrible choice. You can always take certain liberties when transferring from book to film,but you should ALWAYS make a point to try very hard to stay within the mold the character is created when described.I would much rather they had casted an relatively unknown than Tom crusie,who I consider all wrong for the part. The female sidekick they have given him I have really no issues with. Yes she is a TV actress,but I still think she did good,considering what she had to work with.Now the third wheel they have to drag around,who may or may not be his illegit daughter,is a completely different story.

118,PetarNeo,Why?,5,2 November 2016,"Jack Reacher Never Go Back is a next Reacher movie and it focuses on Major Susan Turner that is being set up for an espionage against the country. It was disappointing to watch this one with some memories of last one. Movie is just very slow and some of the scenes are made like Jack is ultimate warrior that has all knowledge and power that there is. There was so little action and fight scenes and the way they were filmed it was just so bad with their highly slowed pace and that they even look like someone is stalling to get time. Good things were light dialogue that kept some positivity in characters and even put some laughable lines. Samantha Dayton is the girl that was pretending to a Jack's daughter was the worst part of the movie. With her playfulness, lack of respect and constant dragging of the scenes towards things that are not important she felt like it was not her place in almost every scenes and that movie could have passed without her character even being inside. She did not contribute to the plot. Tom Cruise is good as always and same goes for Cobie, they just kept movie on some level and with acting didn't let movie fall too low. 2/4",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
119,torstensonjohn,"90's action, soft based storyline",6,2 May 2018,"The introduction of Jack Reacher (2012) which garnered wide box office success looked as if it would be a good character to get invested in. While I did enjoy the context of the first film I expected more from the second. The content of the story is often way overplayed in films and this does not do any justice to the development of the character. There is a very 90's cinematic action feel to the plot. In my honest opinion the way Reacher just freely moved around military facilities was generic at best. The fight sequences while plausible seemed very telegraphed and not visual enough. Cruise projected the toughness and arrogance he has made this character to be very well. I thought Cobie Smulders did a fantastic job as Major Turner, feisty, direct, strong, independent and just how a woman should be portrayed.We have seen these style storylines developed over the years and they always have the same outcome. I felt there could have been more done with the characters in this film and the dialogue and direction was reaching at times.Overall I would give this a 6 out of 10 for me. Not a great film by aby means but is a nice filler for an afternoon. I do hope they stop with this sequel and do not try for a third.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
120,Lewis_Heather787,Unfortunately not as good as the first film but still OK,6,4 November 2016,"After seeing the first Jack Reacher back in 2012 it blew me away with it style, interesting story, action and good performances. I personally was pretty interested in seeing a sequel and where the characters story would go next, unfortunately this was not what I was hoping for. Before all the problems with the film lets start with the positives. Firstly the performances which are good /OK, Tom Cruise is once again a bankable actor that can always bring his A game to the big screen. His portrayal of Jack this time is slightly different than the first film which shows the flexibly of the character in different situations. However he still has the same charm and humour in the first film which is good to see. Cobie Smulders is also good in this film, however sometimes her dialogue is almost to cringe worthy to watch. She adds a good balance to film from being over dominated by Cruise, similarly to what Rosamund Pike did in the first film. Another positive is the action again is good, well choreographed and the fantastic style that Jack Reacher has to fighting. Now lets move onto the negatives, firstly the story. The story of the film is incredibly thin and not very interesting, its amazing how much of an 180 turn it is from the original film, which had a quite complex story. Maybe that's why the decision was made to have this film be a little easier to follow, however it had the opposite effect and made the film in some places boring. Finally the villain in the film, very weak and never seemed a threat to Reacher. Which unfortunately again is 180 opposite of the first film which had a great and mysterious villain which made you care more for Reacher. Finally this film Isn't BAD its just OK/ a bit boring in places, 6/10 or 60% / 100 which is OK. This film never meets the heights of the first and is just flat really which is really sad to see, unfortunately this probably kills the hope of a third film!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

I mean to go with the kick ass movie you should have a kick ass tagline. Tom Cruise is back as Jack Reacher who has back and forth calls with Major Susan Turner ( Cobie Smulders). When he goes to see her he finds she is arrested for a crime she didn't commit. He gets Major Turner after he is also committed for a 16 year old crime ( he obviously didn't commit) he escapes military prison with Major Turner and now they are both on the run trying to clear there names while Reacher tries to protect someone who may change his life forever. I loved the first Jack Reacher back in like what 2012, it was my favorite action movie of that year. You can imagine I was very excited when the sequel was announced and would have Cobie Smulders (Robin from How I Met Your Mother, my favorite TV Show) but when the reviews came out and I saw the percentage on RT (Rotten Tomatoes) I was sorely disappointed. This is adapted from the 18th novel of Lee Child's Jack Reacher books ( as to why they just skipped to the 18th novel I will never understand) I don't read these books I just watch the movies, but I did read someone's review of this film saying that even though Tom Cruise may not be as big as Reacher is in the books he portrays the character like he is in the books so the movie has got that going for it. Along with the good performance from Cobie Smulders and Tom Cruise is the great action sequences that are well paced but the first half of this movie doesn't have good pacing but like right when he gets Major Turner it starts booming and it stays booming with lots of great action-packed fun to be had. I really liked the story angle of Reacher having a daughter even if it was a little predictable. The Direction was pretty good as well, I can see why some may call it a generic action movie. Most of writing does seem like that while other parts like I mentioned earlier the Reacher may have a daughter and has to protect her angle was really cool. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is an adrenaline pumping thrill ride that does seem a little genreic and can be quite slow. But still has good piece of plot and good acting and direction.

Make no mistake this film is about Tom Cruise and no-one else. Every mannerism he has, his trademark way of running in every movie he makes. The stunts he loves to do which make it non realistic. The focus is on him, Tom Cruise all of the time and not on the character of Jack Reacher.
As a standalone action film it was OK but just OK, there are much better films out there at the moment. Extraction absolutely overwhelms Never Go Back for sheer entertainment and action and great acting and direction.
One day they will find a Jack Reacher worthy of the name, possibly someone like Thomas Jane, or Dave Bautista. But after 4 years of denying this movie I finally gave in to pressure from friends and watched it and the disappointment is palpable.

127,gcsman,"Fun, well done B movie fare",6,3 August 2017,"Eventually I suppose Tom Cruise will grow up and realize he can't be an action movie star any more, but in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back he's still soldiering on (pun intended). I think he's actually a pretty capable actor (recent examples e.g. Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion, and going back to Minority Report, Magnolia, Jerry Maguire, Rain Man). But this Jack Reacher outing is just a by-the-numbers actioner. The plot is all conventional, but it's well done and consistently fun to watch. I saw it on Netflix last month to give me something to watch while on my exercycle, and for that purpose it was just fine.So, Reacher (now retired from the military) and his former colleague Major Turner (the versatile Cobie Smulders) have both been framed by an insidious group inside the government for something-or-other, and they have to go rogue and undercover to eventually expose the conspiracy. Along the way they pick up the tritely rebellious girl Samantha (Danika Yarosh, who's no more than OK in the part) who may or may not be Reacher's previously unknown daughter. The rest of it is just enjoying the ride through a complex series of settings and incidents. And of course we get to see Mr. Cruise indulging his obsession for dramatic running -- lots of running. When he can't run any more, maybe that's when he'll realize it's time to hang it up.All in all, a good popcorn flick that does well what it sets out to do.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
128,SpoilerAlertReviews,"Not Terrible, but poor sequel, haters gonna hate even more.",5,21 October 2016,"Okay, I wanna clear something up first before I go on about the rest of the movie, and that is this whole ""Tom Cruise looks nothing like Jack Reacher from the novels."" I'm not going to compare character descriptions as it really doesn't bother me, possibly because I haven't read any of Lee Childs' books, yet I can understand why readers would be upset as I'm all for authenticity, like Ian Fleming's Jame Bond. But, Tom Cruise comes with Childs' blessing, and as with the first one, Childs even cameos in this one as a comically nod to that very blessing. (Lookout for passport control.) Childs has even been quoted saying ""Obviously, Tom Cruise doesn't match the physical description of Reacher in the books... but the movie is not going to match the book anyway."" So, there you have it bookworms, Tom Cruise is Jack Reacher whether you like it or not. Now onto the movie, this one being directed by one of my favourites, Edward Zwick, faved for Glory, Legends of The Fall and especially The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond. He takes over from Christopher McQuarrie who I thought did an excellent job on the first, and it's going to be impossible to write this without comparing Never Go Back to McQuarrie's film. This one lacks quite a lot of what made the first one so good. There isn't really a smart script like before; it teases us but then gets filled with Captain Cliché (Aldis Hodge.) There really isn't enough of the quick-fire back chat the previous gave us, in fact the Reacher is more silent the type here, acting more with the eyebrow raises. It's a weaker story too, not really believable with quite a loss of detail which the first one had, watching Reacher dissecting a scene was brilliantly done with the first one but is almost non- existing this time round. Even the trailer lines parts have been cut to make sense of the plot but means it's quite misleading. I suppose to cover for the rest of the plot which becomes a little annoying at times (no spoilers here) Even Reacher's ego appears to have been watered down, losing the finesse and stature of a true hero. I suppose him meeting Cobie Smulder's Turner on some kind of military dating site, where they've checked out each other's records and mugshots has an affect on him. However he hasn't lost the knack of getting framed for murders he didn't commit. The casting is a little off, but Patrick Heusinger does make a better threat than Jai Courtney possibly being Reacher's match, if not more ruthless. They've borrowed typical bad boss, Prison Break's Robert Knepper who just reminds me too much of Lance Henriksen. There's action, some okay fight scenes and the usual ingredients used for an action movie, but I don't think they impressed me much, especially the car chases. The previous film was superb, actually paying a good homage to the classic car chase with Cruise doing all his own driving. This one wasn't so ""wow"" with a lot of unnecessary scenarios which are just too clichéd and predictable, like the flash of flesh in motel rooms and dark alley encounters. It doesn't stop there, even the score, that was previously done by Joe Kraemer has lost it's military undertone with Henry Jackman doing something just casual and nothing memorable which is a shame as I'm a great fan of Jackman's work. Fans of the first might be disappointed and ""he's not tall enough"" haters gonna hate even more. It's not a terrible film, but it's certainly a poor sequel to a great movie.

We know that Jack Reacher is a one-man army and has no ties to anyone or anything. Yes, we see exceptional choreography within these hand-to-hand and gun fights, but this time things slow down some and we see something different and it is welcomed. This is probably the best Jack Reacher movie ever, mostly because there is more humanity in here and we like the banter between Jack and Samantha, who doesn't know that Jack may be her father. But before all that can take place we see Jack arrested, escape, arrested again this time for murder, but this time he escapes with the arrested Major Turner. He learns Samantha is in danger and goes to her. All three are now on the run in New Orleans trying to figure out why Major Turner was arrested in the first place.

NO reason to spend your money and time. Watching any kind of TV series would be far more interesting. The plot was simple and obvious. It is nice though to see Tom Cruise acting again.

On the run as a fugitive from the law, Reacher uncovers a potential secret from his past that could change his life forever."" The plot is pretty simple and yet quite dark. The pacing goes along nicely and sometimes each scene would get too slow, but it doesn't last long and it gets going! In this one reacher meets up with Officer Turner (Cobie Smulders) and she's been framed for murder as has Reacher. There also may be a HUGE possibility that Reacher may have a daughter he did not know about. Played by Danika Yarosh (Who in our opinion was very miscast and quite annoying). This time Reacher is been chased by ""The Hunter."" A man who will stop at nothing until Reacher is dead.Zwick once made terrific pictures (""Glory,"" ""Legends of the Fall,"" ""Courage Under Fire""), and this one isn't his best. His pedestrian way with action is on full display in ""Never Go Back,"" which offers fights and chases created with confused editing and unpleasant cinematography, and there's an ill-advised detour into romantic tinglings between Jack and Susan, whose chemistry is nonexistent (they look and sound like siblings). Throw in an impish teen girl, barely defined bad guys, and a plot that coversoh, who knows (the script eventually gives up on the particulars of the crime), and the sequel never gets out of first gear. While ""Jack Reacher"" wasn't an especially strong feature, it had memorable moments and pushed Cruise out of his comfort zone. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" doesn't build on the momentum, stripping the burgeoning franchise of grit and thrills.3.5/5 stars 6.5/10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

139,samyoung-82648,2020 perspective: somewhat woke,5,7 July 2020,"This movie is such a disappointment. The first indicators were that Cobie Smulders was in it. Her best line ""don't patronise me"". Ne'er true words could be said to Hollywood and the people that hired her.Smulders is an unlikeable actress. She's also not a particularly good one. I find myself often drawing parallels with Captain Marvel actress, Brie Larson. However, she was complimented by Danika Yarosh (Samantha) as an unlikeable actress who started to shine by the very end of the movie. I did enjoy the way she related to Cruise (Reacher) in the closing minutes. It showed potential if she can lay off the Smulders juice. However, she did have one good line that I enjoyed. Men that like women don't threaten them. Agreed. But I'd add that men who truly respect women don't patronise them either. I would never patronise a worthy woman. Smulders is not worthy.Sadly, I looked up the new Mission Impossible films (Cruise's other franchise) and they've hired all the wrong female cast. They're going for gold in the Woke Olympics. Those two new movies will collapse under the weight of wokeness.My advice. Be prepared for wokeness when you watch this film. It lacked originality, it lacked solid action (just some shallow fight scenes). It had plenty of identity politics. To Smulder's credit, she actually allowed her character to be hit twice. That's surprising for someone with a fragile ego like hers. Cruise's character often gets beaten up. Maybe, there's a small chance for Smulders in the future.5/10 for a solid effort from some of the cast. Let down by the lack of a credible villain, Smulders and Yarosh and even Cruise wasn't on his A game. If you're bored and this is the only option, you could do worse. Although, i'd pick the original over this. I'd also pick most of the Mission Impossibles before this too.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
140,jaredpahl,"Flagrantly Generic. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back Has Old School Charm, but Nowhere to Go with It.",4,4 December 2016,"It is not often I see a movie in theaters without any foreknowledge about what I'm seeing, but that is exactly what I did with Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. I hadn't seen the original Jack Reacher, a surprise hit for Tom Cruise and company, and I hadn't paid any attention to its sequel's marketing, so I went into Never Go Back completely cold. However, the surprise of Jack Reacher 2 was not a very pleasant one. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a wholly unremarkable waste of talent, showcasing one of the best modern action heroes around, and a cast of talented actors and filmmakers, in a boring and forgettable thriller.I won't waste too much time describing the plot because it is far and away the most boring part of Jack Reacher 2. All you really need to know is that an Army Major (or something, it's seriously hard to pay attention to the details here) played by Cobie Smulders is accused of treason and a government fugitive named Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) embarks on a mission to protect her and clear both their names. Oh, and Reacher's long lost daughter (Danika Yarosh) shows up, but I can't, for the life of me, tell you what her purpose in the story is. The plot seems to be deliberately generic, with government secrets, classified weapons, crooked agents, etc. It's the kind of movie where the constant military jargon simply drains your attention span the longer it goes on. I'm not saying a good movie cannot be made from a story like this, but when you hear a constant white noise of ""disavowed"", ""top secret"", ""classified"", ""intell"", and the like, it is easy to completely disconnect yourself from the plot.The plot is dreadfully monotonous, but the two principle actors are almost enough to overcome the paralyzing boredom. Tom Cruise shows why he is one of the best action heroes in the business. He has the type of charisma we used to see with Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime, and Cruise also brings a no-nonsense professionalism that is unique to him. Cobie Smulders is a terrific compliment to Cruise. She's tough, she has the physical presence of a badass military woman, and yet Smulders brings a real sweetness to the role. She is not a caricature.Jack Reacher: Never Go Back does have a certain old-school charm, thanks in large part to the performances of Smulders and Cruise. The catch is that no matter how much charm a film has, if it doesn't show us anything worth seeing, it doesn't matter. Jack Reacher 2 and writer-director Edward Zwick, who has talent (see The Last Samurai, Glory, Legends of the Fall) seems to go out of his way to show us things we've seen hundreds of times before. The story is boring, the action scenes are clichéd, even the sets and locations (with the exception of a New Orleans Halloween Parade) are straight out of any number of straight-to-video action movies from the past 30 years.I don't want to totally trash Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. It does have a refreshing retro kind of action movie spirit, and there are a couple of appealing action scenes with Cruise and Smulders. But the whole enterprise is just too generic to get me interested. Maybe the clichés wouldn't be so obnoxious if they were done in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way, but there is a glaring lack of humor or self-awareness in Jack Reacher 2. It is simply a waste of the talent involved. It might make for a diverting 2 hours if you catch it on TV, but Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is too bland for me to recommend.45/100",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
141,Tactrix,Shouldn't Go Back,4,27 October 2016,"So this movie is about reacher coming to save a woman who took his place running the military police for some time, when he arrives to finally meet her after years of talking on the phone occasionally, he finds she's locked up for something that sounds strangely out of character for her to do, and so it goes from there.Big ouch on this movie, I love the first one, it had everything you need in a solid antihero, short lines, good fighting, great story line. This one had none of that. First let me say why the hell would you switch both directors and fight coordinators? I mean come on, you had a formula that worked so why switch it? Answer is because you want your second movie to bomb, which by my standards it did. The action in this movie looked like half the people that were fighting were stoned, they were super slow in their responses and had absolutely none of the technique the first movie had. The other characters consisted of a whiny girl that you easily get tired of and kind of hope gets killed but yet she stays alive to ruin the entire movie, and a female version of reacher which honestly was probably the best part of the whole movie. 4/10 because nothing in this movie really worked, the plot started slow and fell off as it kept going, the characters they want you to root for you end up not really caring about as the result of bad plot points, and fighting which lets be honest should be the best aspect of these movies was terrible you guys just fell down on the job on this one.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Jack Reacher continuing as an investigator. Jack Reacher helping out his former working partner and major. Jack Reacher's growing his relationship with a girl that may be his daughter.The more movies I watch, the more it stands clear that to grasp my interest in the motion picture, there has to an little innovative tweak, twist, turn or... even better so, an pure original script. The writers Lee Child, Richard Wenk, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz has come down with a steady thriller that comes in play with a couple of angles that is highlighted. And out of that, Edward Zwick has delivered a clear and present danger throughout the production.The casting crew could have been a little more professional in their role... when they chose Cobie Smulders, I could guess some of the crew wondered what the majority was thinking, as she struggles to lift that military face all around.An interesting thing in Tom Cruises movies that he also produces; Nr.1. Here and there he tries to implement existential point of views of life, personal development, mental development, and wisdom, so to speak. Nr. 2. He tries to control the language, and in ""Jack Reacher : Never go back"", correct me if I am wrong, the word f-u-*-K is thrown out the window, as I think Tom Cruise want it to be more of an mature and positive language.Similarity to other movies; Impossible Mission 3. They do a great job that what is going on on the screen is for real, it is the real deal and it is serious. The viewer is getting that right out of the experience of acting. I have to submit to the fact that Tom Cruise is one heck of an actor played an dismantled and dazed character. Watch the scenes in the end and compare to IMP 3 (also in the end).Dialogue of the movie in the end: Samantha: ""Dude..."" Jack Reacher: ""Yeah..."" Samantha: ""You just jumped off a roof of a building...?!"" Jack Reacher: ""Yeah..."" Samantha: ""Did it hurt?"" Jack Reacher: ""Yeah..."" Samantha: ""Why did you do that?"" Jack Reacher: ""Can we possibly have this conversation another time....""Over to the movie as a product: - The production : More than the American standard; nice editing, nice visuals, nice audio... - The actors : Tom is Tom Cruise, and we know he can act. He spells out his pure logic character of an military investigator very well, and blends at the same time deeper solid emotions with that when being the receiver of the information that he maybe has a daughter. Cobie Smulders seems a little off here and there in the acting, especially since the character is a military major and should have been even more on routine and strict to the protocol. All in all, good acting and good directing. - Entertainment : An ordinary story of the military going off the grid having illegal actions. And to that story, there is thrown some innovative angles. A good action thriller. - Age : Violence. Blood. 15.6,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment. 6 Nice production. Good movie.)",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
143,patsworld,Tom Cruise Gets Better With Age,8,29 October 2016,"There is something so fantastic about the action characters as they gain a few years. Tom Cruise in Reacher, Tom Selleck, loved him in Magnum but he had something solid and special going by the time he got to Jesse Stone, Ben Afflick in his recent action films, Bruce Willis, Harrison Ford, Liam Neesom – would love to see Alex Baldwin in another Shadow film - Jeff Bridges, Jeff Daniels, Kevin Costner, Pierce Brosnan, Keanu Reeves .the list goes on and on and I hate to leave anyone out 'cause there are lots more, but these guys, the ones without resorting to ego-driven plastic surgery anyway, are so much more handsome getting older – rugged, attractive faces with character. They seem more believable, much more able to be dependable in an emergency, up to the task of taking out the bad guys, than they did when they were younger. I thoroughly enjoyed Tom Cruise in the latest Jack Reacher picture. And would gladly pay to see another one in the future as he's growing more into the part all the time. Lots of action in this one. The female lead, Cobie Smulders as Turner, was gorgeous enough and tough enough to make a great match for Reacher. Good chemistry between them.

145,annuskavdpol,This movie was like Maverick in Top Gun combined with Mission Impossbile stunts,7,5 November 2016,"Watched ""Never Go Back"" 2016 in the Odeon Movie Theater in the city of Victoria on Wednesday night. The start of the movie is great. The opening scene of all the victims on the ground outside the restaurant and one man in a white t-shirt drinking coffee inside the restaurant is a classical All-America scene of the casualness of violence in the States. I loved how Jack Reacher, played by Tom Cruise is not afraid of the authorities who are attempting to arrest him, and do. Jack Reacher remains calm and predicts a number of steps that will happen which overturn his arrest and proves he is innocent in a matter of seconds. This is a great Hollywood example of how good triumphs over evil.The rest of the movie is kind of slow though. There is conspiracy theory of how the US military is using convert diplomatic immunity to smuggle opium from Afganistan to America by a US military authority, which of course is corruption. Smuggling opium into America is such an old-fashioned theme dating back to the George Bush regime, and the war-on-drugs. I would have preferred the conspiracy theory to have been one based on terrorism, information trading or cyber-attacking as these are more current topics. There is a bit of romance in the movie, and Jack Reacher believes he has a daughter which turns out not to be the case.I have read a couple of the Lee Child's books, and I know the character of Jack Reacher well. Tom Cruise is not rough enough to be Jack Reacher in my opinion. Jack Reacher is a tougher man - like Leonardo DiCaprio in Shutter Island.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

148,margulanabutrlov,Jack Reacher: Never Go Back Review,9,23 March 2019,"When Major Turner (Cobie Smulders), Reacher's (Tom Cruise) successor in the Military Police, is arrested for espionage, he starts poking around. When he's then framed for murder, he busts her out and they set out to clear their names.
Sure, he's a fine actor, but what Tom Cruise does really well is run. And Ed Zwick, having directed him before, clearly knows that. So, as Never Go Back approaches the half-hour mark and with Cruise yet to break into anything above a brisk walk, Zwick cuts to him sprinting for a cab. And then, to make up for lost time presumably, a few minutes later he runs for a bus. He may be 54 now (and it's not quite him trying to outrun a sandstorm), but watching Cruise run has lost none of its thrill.
Of course that is, technically, another stick with which doubters can beat this cinematic Reacher, should they be so inclined. Book Reacher's lumbering lack of speed is a rare weakness and is brought up semi-regularly, but clearly it's not an issue here. (Even though he does miss that bus.) But it feels, two movies in, as though it's time to make peace. For better or worse, taller or shorter, when it comes to cinematic Reacher, Cruise is our man.
And (despite all that running) there is good news. Zwick here takes Reacher closer to the books - tougher, gruffer and no longer boasting the skills of a stunt-car driver. (At least, not that we're shown.) In fact, he's usually in the passenger seat. The opening scene, which sees police arrive at a diner with four bodies writhing in agony on the car park floor, and Reacher calmly sitting inside drinking his coffee, is a perfect example - an Indiana Jones-style end-of-the-last-adventure vignette that immediately sets the scene for this grittier vision. We're not in the same territory in terms of stylistic differences as Mission: Impossible and its immediate sequel - there are no slo-mo doves here - but it's still a noticeably different beast.
The stakes are higher here than in Jack Reacher - he's framed for murder after poking around in the arrest of Turner (Smulders), the major who's doing his old job in the Military Police. She's been accused of espionage, but Reacher senses something's afoot (which his arrest proves), so he breaks them both out of prison and they go on the run, closely followed by hitmen determined to stop them. Plus there's an added wrinkle: 15-year-old Samantha (Danika Yarosh), a girl Reacher's only just found out about, who may or may not be his daughter, is also caught in the firing line. Cue familial-style bickering between the three.
According to Lee Child, the presence of Samantha in Never Go Back is one of the main reasons this story was chosen, and it's an interesting addition in terms of Reacher's character development - will the drifter find an anchor? Sure, it took 18 books of wandering for this particular paternity issue to come up and we're only on film two, but it's not without precedent - the issue of settling down was raised as early as book three when Reacher inherited a house (he decided against it).
Reacher's also drafted back into the army after a clause in his release papers is activated, allowing them (rather than the police) to hold him for the murder he's accused of. This sets up some soul-searching about whether someone like him can ever have a normal life, and brings up the question about why he left in the first place. ""Let's just say, I woke one morning and the uniform didn't fit,"" he tells Turner.
But where Never Goes Back does fall short in comparison with Jack Reacher, despite the lower stakes, is the central mystery. One Shot, the book the first film is based on, boasted one of the best (if not the best) of the entire series. Never Go Back does not. Recognising that, much here has been changed from the source material. Some necessary (the book fizzles out whereas this builds to a final showdown), some just different - no LA, as soon as the trio leave DC they head to party town New Orleans, where the finale just happens to coincide with the annual Hallowe'en parade. But the murky machinations of the arms-dealing still can't compete with the purity of the original's sniper mystery. Next time it would be wise to choose one of the better-plotted books - Killing Floor or Bad Luck And Trouble perhaps.
And it looks likely there will be a next time. This is only the second instance where Tom Cruise has committed to a sequel, and presumably it's with eyes on a long-running franchise. With M:I it took him three movies to nail the tone and formula; with Reacher he's managed it a film earlier.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

150,tstudstrup,"Boring, cliché, too long, annoying female lead",1,19 December 2016,"Takes it self way too seriously.Boring action with a lot of retarded Hollywood running. Actually more running than fighting. Watching Tom Cruise kick ass like a superman and never meet someone stronger than him gets old, like Tom himself, who looks really old here. And really short.The military woman played by Cobie Smulders, from How I Met Your Mother, is the poor woman's Jennifer Connelly. She's bitchy and annoying and over-acting in every scene she is in. She also played the most boring character in the highly overrated boring sit-com: How I met your mother. The kid is annoying too.Like the awful Bourne movies, there is not a shred of humor here.Even the bad-guys are dull and not interesting.The most mind blowing part about this generic action-thriller, at least that's what it wants to be, is that it's directed by Edward Swick, who also directed Blood Diamond. Which had a great story, great acting, great villains, suspense and awesome major actionscenes. This crap has none of that. And I'm guessing he cast Cobie Smulders, because Jennifer Connelly, who was in Blood Diamond, said no. Or Cobie Smulders was a lot cheaper. The fact that Tom Cruise is involved in so many aspects of the production is usually a good thing. Here it's completely opposite. Every actor in this movie seems as bored and as annoyed and not into it, as we the audience did. They're clearly just there, either because it's a Tom Cruise movie that can further their careers or for the paycheck. Or both. That creates characters nobody cares about. Result: a complete faliure. One more thing: all the critics of course love this movie. For once I would just like an honest critic not praising a movie automatically, because they've been bought and/or it's either part of a franchise and/or has major moviestars attached to it.

To name 'em all, Mission Impossible 1 and 3, A Few Good Men, The Firm, Eyes Wide Shut, Minority Report, Collateral, Edge Of Tomorrow and Jack Reacher. The quality of these movies mustn't necessarily be attributed to Cruise, but mostly to the rest of the cast or to the person sitting in the director's chair.The first Reacher was actually well made. It had some twists and some funny moments, which was great. This movie however, was kinda boring, too predictable and altogether disappointing. I know that it's difficult to follow up on a good first movie in a franchise, but it's definitely doable. One scene in particular bugged the hell out of me, when they're in the hotel and arguing about who's supposed to visit the soldier's wife and who's staying behind to watch the kid. Ridiculous. She would've most certainly died if it had happened the other way around. Hell, in the real world he would've died too.Two roles that were terribly miscast in this are the female leads. The daughter was kinda fine, but Smulders was terrible for the part. According to the director's track record, this should've been way better. He has shown that he can make great movies (Blood Diamond).

155,HarryLags,A good movie that keeps you entertained.,8,23 October 2016,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the sequel to 2012's Jack Reacher; both movies are based on the popular books by Lee Child. Like the first, this is a Tom Cruise thriller, so there's plenty of edge-of-your-seat action. Reacher is a one-man wrecking crew who leaves a trail of broken bodies.Characters get shot, and are beaten to death. The fight scenes, especially the bone- snapping endings can be pretty intense.It's mostly hand-to-hand, but they're fast and high-impact.I'll skip over the rest of the plot, except to say that the filmmakers have concocted a counter-Reacher called the Hunter (Patrick Heusinger), a soldier who left the service but realized he ""can never go back to the world."" (""Never go back"" — get it?) Now he shoots and beats people to death for rich employers. Reacher picks up the Hunter's tail, which isn't too difficult since he's dressed in black with black gloves and might as well be wearing a name tag saying, my name is: ASSASSIN. This is another of those movies in which the tough bad guy is always trying to tell the tough good guy how much alike they are so the good guy can say something to the effect that they're nothing alike as he puts a spike through the bad guy's neck or pushes him off a skyscraper. Which is not what happens here. Anyway i thought Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is an excellent film with plenty of action and some great hand-to-hand fight scenes. Tom Cruise is fantastic as usual, but the only problem i had was that after a brutal fist fight in the end, Cruise's face only has a couple of cuts. They should have put some more make up effects on his face to make it look more realistic, after a violent fight like that.But despite of all this, i thought it was very entertaining and recommend it to any action lover to go and see this movie. It's a good film that keeps the viewer entertained.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
156,DunkelheitVZ,well-defined mediocrity,5,9 March 2018,"Don't get me wrong, I get it why some people think this movie is amazing. When I was 18, Jean-Claude van Damme movies pressed all the right buttons for me, too. But if you have watched so many movies as I did, I can hardly find anything going for this movie. 
It is well executed, highly professional, it has no rough edges, only smooth curves, it has extremely high production values, actors who know what they are doing and the movie is amazingly boring. 
Nothing in there which I did not see 100 times already, the plot is as average as it can get. I don't know, but if there would be something imperfect about this movie, I might maybe be somehow able to get some joy out of it, but this is a higly polished granite, which could easily be a diamond if the filmmakers were willing to take at least the slightest bit of risk. Well, if you want to nitpick, I could not really believe that Tom Cruise is the super agent, the whole daughter thing felt tacked on and Cobie Smulders does not strike me as a military type (a role that was much, much better filled by Demi Moore in ""a few good men"") I don't know if it is me or if Hollywood has lost it, but I most certainly can find more enjoyment out of the older Cruise movies. 5 Stars out of 10 from me for the ultimate non-risk boringness",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
157,sujanfaster,Only for Tom,6,31 October 2016,"For me, Tom Cruise is not just another actor. He is a hero. He is tailor made to play powerful and dominating roles. Of late he hasn't experimented a lot and is sticking to action flicks which I don't mind either. As long as Tom Cruise entertains me he can make 10 Mission Impossible movies and I'd still watch them. But can he make another Jack Reacher movie? Errmmmmm I guess I will pass on that.It is funny that I am writing the review of Jack Reacher after writing the review for Inferno. I have read Inferno but I haven't read Jack Reacher. I am experiencing the contrast of writing reviews having read the book and having not at a very short time gap. So this review is in no comparison with the novel but just as a plain dumb moviegoer. I had liked the Jack Reacher first part although not very much. It wasn't very entertaining or had a very good story line but it had its moments. Since Jack Reacher Never Go Back isn't an exact sequel this movie doesn't have much dependency on the previous one. I am a sucker for the 'fugitive from law concept', but this film doesn't get it right. The first reason for that is, Jack Reacher himself goes looking for trouble instead of the government coming for him. It is not very convincing to see why Jack Reacher would like to help an army officer just because he liked talking to her on phone. Then the movie becomes a typical cat and mouse chase with Reacher and Turner running from the government and assassins and trying to prove they are innocent. Despite its crisp action sequences the movie fails to impress because of its unwanted subplot and jaded screenplay. There is hardly any humor to save the day.We all can see Tom Cruise is aging but he shows no less energy in performing stunts. Cobie Smulders is great, but I would have preferred her role should have had a lesser scope because this is JACK REACHER film. Danika Yarosh as Reacher's out of the wedlock daughter is the most annoying character I have scene in recent times. Patrick Heusinger as a ruthless hired gunman with a foreign accent fits the bill. There are hardly any other important characters to care much about.I am a big Tom Cruise fan and I never miss sequels once I start watching any franchise. If you are of the same type go ahead and take a shot at watching this.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
158,alanpuzey,Really an 8½ but let's review it,8,26 March 2020,"Well I've become quite a 'Reacher' fan this year, reading a few Lee Child's excellent novels.So of course I've had to take a look at the two movies made so far. 'Reacher' was pretty good, a 7/10 in my book, but I would have to give 'Never Go Back' 8½, which doesn't equate with IMDB, so 8 or 9 will be decided when I post this.I', quite surprised that so many reviewers thought the first movie was better. For me where the second movie excelled was:1 The lead actress was so well portrayed and an excellent foil to Reacher himself.2 Sometimes the first movie's editing was too slow. Headshot scenes were held longer than necessary. This did no happen in 'Never Go Back'.3 Overall, the script and editing were far tighter in 'Never Go Back' and right on track.OK - from a Brit's point of view, the final 5 minutes were typical American 'happy ending' which happens so often. I've made allowances and in this case it was not 'too bad'.I thought the female lead in the second film much better too. Tom Cruise reacted well with her and his 'possible' daughter.I find it quite absurd how many reviewers gripe on about Reacher should be 114 kgs and 198 cms tall (sic). This is a film adaptation, not a facsimile!Hey there Tom - if you want my advice, ditch 'Mission Impossible' series now - and carry on with Reacher, making it even better.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

162,paradux,Abomination,5,25 October 2016,"This is not my first rodeo. I fully understand how an A-List actor can reach a certain stage in his career and start to worry if interest will wane, the prime roles will no longer be coming his way.So this A-List actor takes the initiative and buys the rights to the #1 ""men's action novel"" of the day and then secures the cash to cast himself in the lead. Clever. It is a sure thing. The novel is a zillion seller and he has a worldwide fan base and the money boys are always looking for a project with a built-in edge.So what can go wrong? Everything.If you thought that the first effort in this franchise -- Jack Reacher -- was the low point, you obviously have no seen this sequel.The first film was simply weak. This one is dreadful.Cruise (I am a fan BTW) is not merely an action figure but a competent actor. Yet, as hard as he tries, he cannot find the right tone for Reacher.The direction and screenplay are wretched. The kick in the Reacher novels in how much of the action plays out in the character's head before he acts. Men like that. They like to think they can solve stuff in real time. It is a guy thing.It is does not translate well on film however. Bourne reacts. That works on film. Reacher strategizes. Not so easy to show.The story is dull as old cheese. The action sequences are so rare they should have captions like those old gas stations in Nevada -- ""last action scene before 28 minutes of drivel.""

Nothing that made you love the first film was incorporated in the sequel. None of the comedy, none of the sexiness, none of the beauty and definitely none of the star power.Cobie is an unattractive, unbelievable, unsatisfactory choice for the female lead. The only worse choice might have been Ronda Rousy. Every twist, turn or plot point is telegraphed, so nothing about the film will surprise you and the only African American character is left to step, fetch and buffoon himself until the closing credits.I could not have been more disappointed and with Tom Cruise creeping up on 60, his time pulling off the action hero is limited, so I would hope he would be more selective about what he signs up for.Poorly played all the way around.

166,qeter,Good entertainment,6,10 January 2017,"I like Cruise. He takes acting so seriously. He is always trying hard to satisfy the cinema audience. The plot itself is not the best. But I liked how it established a plot development in which Jack Reacher got nearly convinced he might have a daughter. And how Cruise played this character who is getting acquainted to the idea of having a child. I was emotionally captured by the closing pictures, when the girl wants to embrace him - her ""might have been dad"" - but Jack stays confined and clueless before relaxing himself. All the believable emotion is played in a way that only Cruise can do. It is a pity that Cruise still gets underrated for his performances. He deserves that the critics take him seriously. With Jack Reacher Cruise has established a clever character. He might be able to come back to Reacher from time to time without need to stay young forever.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
167,DBLurker,"Hmm, well..",5,8 December 2017,"I gave the first Jack Reacher movie 8/10, definitely worth watching. For this, I kept thinking about the issues I had with this movie, after I was done watching. Initially, I gave this movie 7/10, then went down to 6/10 and eventually settled on 5/10.The thing is, this movie is just.. OK. First movie introduced you to Jack Reacher and his style (I have not read the books) and to be honest, Jack Reacher is a toned down Ethan Hunt (Mission Impossible), solving military cases. But it worked and the first movie was entertaining.Never Go Back, does the same thing, but tries too hard to make Jack Reacher ""cool"", especially with the opening setup which made no sense (the trailer IS the opening) and just happened cause it was supposed to make Jack look cool.. I guess to the audience who haven't seen the first movie? But whatever, moving on, he suddenly has a love interest and a supposed child. Which turns most of the movie into a sitcom with action scenes severely feeling ""meh"" despite probably doing more than the first movie. No idea who they were aiming for when they picked this book to make a movie out of (family?).Also, the ""daughter"" is played by a 18 yr old actress playing 15 yr old and she doesn't look 15 at all. That said, she played her part just fine.The ""love interest"" on the other hand is a tough new age woman that tries REALLY hard to look and act tough. It just became ridiculously funny the more she acted that way, while looking like a supermodel. Perfectly captured a strong feminist I guess? I dunno, it was just funny cause she had trouble even defeating one guy properly and they had to bring Jack to her level to make her look tough. It's pathetic.The point is, the story goes nowhere in the end with her. All that happens is she gets implicated, runs away, then goes back to doing what she was doing before.Few action scenes are OK, nothing amazing. I did like the last chase scene for some reason. It was pretty realistic the way goons were looking for a character.5/10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
168,Rat_27,Should not have gone back,5,19 January 2017,"I really enjoyed the first one, and I was excited to see this one. And ... it started off disappointing, and stayed there. The previews showed us the diner scene, and that was ... it. That was the entire scene. No, we didn't get the fight. No action at all. We didn't have any lead up to the sheriff, as it was all just an intro. The whole movie just felt like a lot of not-really connected stories with one common character.A lot of the scenes felt forced. For instance, when Hardison (Leverage was a great show, and he will ALWAYS be Hardison to me) gets a shiner, he takes the cold compress off his face just to show the audience and make a tough guy statement, and then ... he's no longer bruised. Yeah ... us black folk DO bruise. And, I expected Aunt Robin to be a bit better at running and/or hiding from the police. Her character is supposed to be an MP, and they are supposed to be cops. Well, they ARE cops. And cops are supposed to be able to investigate things, because ... that's what cops do. So, her running through town in half of a military work uniform is just ... silly. Only to be followed up by the ""professional"" who almost gets runned over by a bus. A BUS. Looking both ways before you cross is definitely part of situational awareness. I'm sure it's in the manual somewhere, and if not ... it should be an addendum. I also expect covert operatives to NOT drive Maseratis, as they tend to stick out. The idea that two people can chase off a kitchen full of cooks tells me that someone never worked in a one before. Ain't no way that many cooks are leaving their station. If you swing a ladle at a cook, he will hit you with a meat tenderizer. Several times.The dialogue was extremely poor in parts. ""Sir, she's trying to access the system."" ... IT guys don't talk like that. And ... why does everyone call him Reacher? He's not even in the military, but when you are ... you still use first names when you are on a familiar basis with someone. It should be ""Jack"", or ""Mr. Reacher"". But ...This movie fell very short for me. I had high hopes after the first one, but this one failed to engage.

Having read some Jack Reacher novels, I thought the movie captured the instinct for trouble that pulls Reacher into these situations pretty well.The fight scenes were intense. Especially the final fight had a harshness to it, that one does not often see in movies. The two last guys standing are really trying to end each other. Handcuffs are not an option.I also liked how they did not make Colbie Smulders the beautiful bystander. She was just as tough as Reacher. A great role for a woman in an action movie!

171,RLTerry1,Tom Cruise Proves that he IS a movie star in the classical sense!,7,20 October 2016,"Outstanding action movie! Paramount Pictures and Skydance's Jack Reacher: Never Go Back simply does not disappoint. Jack Reacher may never become a household name like James Bond or Jason Bourne, but Tom Cruise proves once again that he truly is an action hero. Furthermore, Cruise is probably the best example of a movie star in the classical sense. You know an actor is truly a movie star when the public refers to his or her movies as ""the new Tom Cruise movie."" Even the Bourne and Bond movies are not referred to by the respective actors. Lee Childs' best-seller makes for an excellent cinematic military conspiracy action thriller! Separating this Reacher installment from the previous one and the Bond and Bourne movies is the fact that Childs and writer-director Edward Zwick give Reacher a pseudo-nuclear family. Although action movies are the epitome of high concept films, by adding a pseudo-nuclear family, a very human element is added to the story that adds some depth and allows for humor that otherwise wouldn't work. Never Go Back comes complete with equal amounts of bad ass action and levity. Not terribly cerebral, this action-thriller provides audiences with a couple hours of high impact cinematic entertainment at which you can sit back, take your mind off life outside of the auditorium, and enjoy the action that only Tom Cruise can bring to the screen.The Clint Eastwood-esque action hero is back. After busting a corrupt sheriff's office in Oklahoma, Reacher (Cruise) finds himself amidst a conspiracy and cover-up involving the C.O. (commanding officer) who took over his previous position. Mgr. Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) is arrested on charges of espionage. Believing strongly that Turner is being setup, Reacher doesn't hold back in solving the mystery and taking out those who would stand in his way. Crossing paths with the military police himself, Reacher soon finds out that the corruption runs deeper than he first thought. When faced with not only the dilemma of Turner but also the possibility that he may have fathered a child, Reacher must fight two concurrent battles. With mind and body under attack, Reacher stops at nothing to exonerate Turner and provide protection for his possible daughter.Upon watching this film, I couldn't help but notice the similarities between Never Go Back and Eastwood's The Outlaw Josey Wales, by all accounts a masterpiece by the legendary actor and filmmaker. Both stories are about a renegade/loner who acquires a family of sorts. Although the film is very well produced, there is a flaw in that it is apparent that Reacher wants to 'reach' further and delve deeper than the superficial plot allows for. Evidence of this is in his dialog that suggests that he wants to be a more dynamic individual who is capable of love and devotion but gets stuck being the action hero all the time because violence is the only thing at which he excels. One of the most prominent themes in the movie is the juxtaposition between high intensity fight scenes and deadpan humorous family drama. By including contrasting elements, the film provides a real opportunity to love the protagonists and hate the antagonists.Cruise definitely displays some of the best acting of his career in this installment of the Jack Reacher series. He does an excellent job of communicating the difficulty in balancing both the defensive and offensive in terms of protecting his ""family"" and providing empathetic nurture. I suppose one could infer that the film contains a reimagined ""nature vs. nurture"" quandary. His reaction to his possible daughter is classic. Throughout the dialog and blocking, it is clear that Reacher is struggling with how to be a dad-like figure but also keep his focus on solving the mystery. Just like any Eastwood-esque story about a loner who has a taste of what being part of a family is like, the movie ends with a fated goodbye scene between his 'daughter' Samantha (Danika Yarosh) and himself. But just before it get too heartbreaking, Zwick throws in a pleasant twist.If you are in the mood for a good old-fashioned military conspiracy action drama, then look no further. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back strikes a fun balance between kung-fu movies and quirky family dramas. Cruise will definitely not disappoint in this film He does what he always does. Provides us with solid action-star acting coupled with some humor along the way.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Same regurgitated overconfident nonsense that sounds like something coming from your executive guru. In 15 seconds that pay phone is going to ring and I'm going to have all your butts kicked.For reasons unexplained, Cruise is after the sexy military lady he's never actually met. And since he has nothing else to do in his sorry excuse for a life which he somehow survives on with pocket change, he's decided to come back to save her from some unknown sinister plot. Throw in some ridiculous subplot that will change his life forever, although he doesn't seem to have paid much attention. Only good enough to have the subject of his attention somehow use the same tricks and same lines on him as he uses on others. Wow, is this some much too clever way of saying ""you two must be related?"" Or is it a red herring? This film is too clichéd and full of stupid lines that try so hard to be clever.I had a difficult time making it through the first third of the film since, as usual, it's just way too easy for a bad ass like this Reacher guy who ""they ran out of medals"" to award him for his awesomeness. It's a Cruise ego trip with a paint by number story where the good guys make all the things that would seem so very hard seem so simple and where security you'd expect to encounter just happens to be conveniently missing.

I don't think this was very well received but I'd be down to see Cruise keep this series going, whether it be similarly anthological to the way the M:I franchise has kind of been or they can bring back recurring characters, I wouldn't care but it doesn't seem like the series will continue. If anything, the reason this is a lesser film than the first because of the script and the direction. Gone is the writing and directing talent of Christopher McQuarrie, and is instead replaced with Edward Zwick and his writing team. Unfortunately, they're noticeably a step down with less inventive and naturally occurring action scenes, but also the villains are extremely generic making them apparently weak to the audience. Besides the link of Cruise between the two films, they could be entries in totally different series as this really does fall into standard 2010s action movie fare. It's frustrating because of how much I enjoyed the first one, but you can't fault Cruise and Smulders for not trying.The 2 Reacher films are a slower, more serious, and sometimes surprisingly violent approach to the thriller than those M:I films take, and not to say I don't enjoy those. I quite like them, even more than these Reacher flicks. Lastly, these movies, like most Cruise films, also have nice surprise interjections of humor that land more often than not; which displays a pretty rare side of Cruise we don't see usually at the forefront of his characters in movies.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

177,bodhi-13262,Never Go Back....on Jack:),7,21 October 2016,"'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' is the second film of the franchise based on the books by author Lee Child. There were more positive reviews than not on the first film, but does this sequel deliver a heavy punch as it's predecessor?1. Tom Cruise himself is still committed as ever to this character, and it is clearly evident in his portrayal of the iconic Jack Reacher. If you have seen the previous film, then you know exactly what kind of man Reacher is and what he's about. The plot to this film isn't anything special, it simply deals with a contact of Reacher's, Major Turner (Cobie Smulders) who's been framed for the involvement of the deaths of two soldiers under her command while in Afghanistan. Jack Reacher sets out to prove her innocence while evading the law and trying to unravel the conspiracy behind it all.2. One of the reasons why this film falls a little short compared to the first, is due to the writing. The dialogue isn't bad, but it is bland. I suppose it was to the credit of writer/director Christopher McQuarrie as to why the first film stood out as well as it did. Surely this script needed a punch-up writer on board to fix things. Another flaw of the movie comes in the form of a young girl named Samantha (Danika Yarosh), who is 'presumed' to be Reacher's forgotten daughter. The introduction of this character really drags the film down since she only serves to be a feisty teenager and a catalyst for tension by the time the climax rolls around.3. The action (for the most part) has been amplified since the last film. You see arms, legs and even necks being broken which utterly makes you flinch. Even Jack Reacher himself proves to be human when you see him take some serious lashes throughout this film. For someone is his 50s, I give Tom Cruise a lot of credit for pushing the sheer physicality of Jack Reacher. However, I was equally impressed by the antagonist of this film, who simply goes by the name of 'The Hunter' (Patrick Heusinger). Every fight in the movie is surely entertaining as much as it it brutal, so viewers beware. 4. There is an awesome chase and fight sequence on Bourbon street in New Orleans for the climax of this movie that really leaves you feeling like some part of your body is broken. For a female lead, Cobie Smulders really holds her own and boys does she know how to take a punch. There are so many cool things about this movie yet it still feels like a step back from the first in some way. I suppose the cleverness of the script and the sense of it being a gripping mystery/thriller is what's missing. Don't get me wrong, Edward Zwick did as good of a job as far as directing an action film based on the material he had to work with.If it wasn't for Tom Cruise himself, audiences wouldn't care too much for a film like this, but it delivers the right amount of entertainment. I'd still recommend any action lover to go see this movie with an open mind no matter if you've read the books or not. Overall, I'm still REACHing for more Jack Reacher;)",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
178,keyope,"Starts well, gets really dull",5,1 January 2017,"I found the first Jack Reacher film to be pretty bad so I had low expectations for this one. But I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was in the beginning. It starts with a fair bit of action and an intriguing plot. And Reacher is using all his skills to get to the bottom of what is going on. The dialogue too, was witty and engaging. But then after about half an hour it starts to go downhill. The clichéd kick-ass female shows up and starts basically being abusive to Reacher at every opportunity, even threatening to ""beat him up"" if he doesn't change his ways and realise that she's every bit as clever as him etc etc. To make matters worse, the young girl at the centre of the plot (who may or may not be Reacher's daughter) shows up, and she's totally obnoxious, but of course she's a kick-ass too. The film struggles on up to the hour mark, just about keeping you interested, but then the plot (and Reacher) go missing. You get lumbered with the two female characters sitting together talking about how awful men are, then the older woman teaches the girl how to beat up a man and how to ""kick him in the balls"". Seriously if Hollywood has to persist with kick-ass females in every single action movie, at least make them likable (eg Kill Bill, The Matrix, Lethal Weapon 3). Why do they always have to be Mary Sues? So after the hour mark I lost all interest in this film.

179,mts-78680,Jack Is Back,7,22 January 2017,"Plenty of action and has just enough of the plot from Books to keep avid fans guessing. Acting very good but as usual script has several holes. Guess they want too squeeze too much action in which leaves little time for character development.Tom Cruise rocks as Jack even though his size makes you doubt his ability to pull off performances compared to book character. Mainly because we've seen him do well in other action flicks, it's believable and exciting.Good: Character remains true to book and fans can enjoy the plot even with questionable writing.Reacher justice continues to keep us appreciating him even if he breaks most of laws he used to enforce as a MP.Keep fans wanting another film with action scenes and similarities from books.Bad: Everyone else around main characters made to appear clueless, incompetent or just foolish. Audiences don't need this to appreciate skills of main characters.Jack has critical info needed with no clue how he got it. Must be osmosis the way he knows all the phone numbers he needs, locations, etc. I know it is boring details but at least show us something.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
180,TC-Batsy,Incredible Movie,10,1 November 2016,"I don't care what the critics think because I really enjoyed watching Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and saw it twice since its release. It's more than an action movie with Tom Cruise who never fails in delivering his best performances to date, you'll find drama and comedy and the interactions between the characters of Tom, Cobie Smulders and Danika Yarosh very amusing and heart-warming. We all know Jack Reacher is a tough guy but it was interesting to see him display emotions which he rarely does. Also, Aldis Hodge was very impressive as Espin. The soundtrack is also great and I look forward to see a third Jack Reacher movie. Just ignore the critics and see the movie for yourself.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Retained for future viewing.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
182,Pramitheus,Never come back,1,22 January 2017,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Tom Cruise from his Mission: Impossible days. I love the guy and he knows that he has a huge fan following but I think he should be a bit more sensitive about it. If you're gonna milk the fandom too hard, you will end up destroying the love that you have and also end up stereotyping yourself. He is good as Ethan Hunt and that's it. He should do that and make other movies that will suit his age. Sorry, I have to admit that Tom Cruise is getting old. SCREENPLAY - I have just started to understand the craft of film- making and as I always say, it's hard. Assigning an aspect of the movie with an adjective is very insulting, but when the writers do not respect the audience by presenting something coherent and interesting, I think an adjective is necessary. So in order to define the narrative, horrendous will do. The dialogue is just juvenile at best. I vaguely remember the 1st Jack Reacher movie. It wasn't any masterpiece, but it wasn't as slow-paced as this one. I understand that they are dealing with more sub-plots and that needs some slowing down, but at what cost? It just becomes plain boring.DIRECTION - Just remember what I said about my respect for film- making and then judge me. That said, the direction was like walking 100 kilometres through mud. Just dragging on and on. The camera-work was so monotonous. The pacing was completely off. There was no tension. There was literally nothing to help me get invested. Just glaring plot- holes staring right at me. I almost became CinemaSins. I actually found a new sense of respect for CinemaSins because what he does needs a lot of patience. Wait a second, Edward Zwick has directed The Last Samurai, Love and other Drugs and Pawn Sacrifice. I love all three of them and now this? Well, miracles do happen, be it good or bad. Bad in this case surely. There was also that awful CGI. It was pretty distinguishable all the time.ACTING - Well, when the screenplay and direction has failed you, what can the actors do? Tom Cruise ( and I say this with a heavy heart) gave a very wooden performance. I think he was trying to be serious and not be Ethan Hunt. It wasn't working. That is because there are no character arcs. Nothing about the character was established from the previous movie that could have been worked into this movie. So he just ended up an impression of Hunt. Cobie Smulders was okay at best. She looked tired for some reason. Again, no character arcs and that didn't allow me to connect with her character traits. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, were just clichéd characters that you see in movies like Taken. FINAL VERDICT - I haven't read the book, but if it's good then stick to it. Give a pass on this movie. It's certainly not worth the effort and if you know or are in contact with Tom Cruise, just tell him to choose wisely from next time.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
183,FilmMcCool,Not that Bad,6,25 March 2019,"Firstly no Movie I have ever seen that was based on a book I had read was ever as good as the book, it can't be. When reading a book your own imagination is creating the images, a movie on a TV or cinema cannot compete with your own imagination, well not mine anyway. Next when i heard Tom Cruise was playing Reacher I thought, what, Reacher is 6'5"" but it did not matter in the end. The storyline and plot more or less stayed true to the book and I thought cruise did a good job playing Reacher, no over the top Batman type stuff that some directors may have fallen foul to.

184,bartonj2410,Dud sequel,4,22 October 2016,"I find it very surprising that, in a career that has lasted nearly forty years and with all the popular films he's had, Jack Reacher is only the second character that Tom Cruise has returned to play in a sequel. Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible franchise is the other so it speaks volumes of how much Cruise likes playing this character.Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a former Major in the Army, is returning to the headquarters of his old military unit to meet Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders), who has helped him solve a few cases in the past, when he begins to uncover a conspiracy theory that has seen Turner thrown in jail.Together the pair must go on the run and clear their names however, a potential secret from Reacher's past threatens to put them in even more danger. I really enjoyed Jack Reacher so I was naturally looking forward to this sequel. It's a great shame then that Jack Reacher: Never Go Back fails to recapture what made the first film so good. The first film did the subtle comedy very well but this sequel just takes itself way too seriously. Maybe it's down to the fact Edward Zwick directed this one and he hasn't really made too many comedies in the past.There are attempts at humour but they don't really work too well. The film deals with a murder case, similar to its predecessor, but the tone of the film feels all too serious. The fight scenes in the first film had the humour that made them so entertaining but there isn't really any of that here. In fact, the action sequences in Never Go Back are sporadically edited, making it near impossible to tell who is who at times.The commitment Tom Cruise has towards his films is admirable but even he fails to spark life into the uninspired story and script. Cobie Smulders manages to hold her own against Cruise in a male dominated genre but she does get quite irritating by the film's conclusion, as does Danika Yarosh, whose part I won't discuss in case people want to go in without knowing.With a number of Lee Childs' novels to adapt, we could see more Jack Reacher films in the future. If that is the case, I really hope it mirrors the Mission: Impossible franchise in the way that the second film is by far the worst and they only get better from here.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
185,imdb2-5,Terrible. Clichéd. Narcissistic pleasure vehicle for Cruise,2,1 January 2017,"I'll get right to the point. Cruise leaves one location and then somehow the camera cuts to an empty street, leaving you the viewer to guess that Cruise arrived there from the previous scene. Nobody is in view as he turns the corner. Suddenly two guys appear from behind. And then he approaches an intersection and there are more men coming from the sides. I wonder. Will Jackie boy beat them all up as if he's Chuck Norris taking on stiff bullies? This is like a bad 70s TV show except it takes itself deadly seriously. The few jokes in the film are flatter than the EKG of those who wrote this script. The big Reacher reveal about secret that may change his life forever his hilariously bad. Things don't happen the way they did in the movie. Everyone is guilty or responsible because they have to be in order to keep the plot going. Proof? Unnecessary. Even a shred of it. People don't act on claims that aren't believable. And that's how this movie falls apart from the start, including the laughably bad promises of the villain. Zero chemistry from any of the actors.

187,fletcherc21,Formulaic and Familiar,6,23 November 2017,"Jack Reacher 2 doesn't bring anything new to the action genre, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is another Tom Cruise action movie, smaller in scope than the Mission Impossible movies, but still exciting with plenty of action scenes. They mix it up a little from the standard formula by taking the lone wolf Jack Reacher and making him work with others. Those others, Cobie Smulder's Major Turner and a teenage girl (Danika Yarosh), also prefer to work alone, so there is some conflict besides the main plot and villains.Speaking of those villains, there is really no depth there. There is the standard Bond formula of a big evil guy behind a desk and his agent working in the field. Neither one is developed as a character and there is no reason to care about what they are doing because there is no real risk that they are out-thinking Jack Reacher.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
188,bbv-69237,Jack Reacher is Dead - absolute rubbish,3,19 October 2016,"Hollywood cops out and Lee Child sells out. I strongly advise that Reacher fans (of the novels) stay away and don't go watch this.As someone that was not anti-Cruise and thought the first movie was OK, I went to see this next episode of the 'Reacher Franchise' with great hopes. To say I am bitterly disappointed is an understatement. In fact I am angry and upset.When Hollywood takes something BIG like the Reacher novels, which has sold almost 100 million copies, there is an obligation to at least stay close to the persona and character of the novels. The first movie was OK, but this was not in the same ballpark - it was not in the same league - it is nothing like the novels - Jack in this movie is nothing like Jack in the novels.Since when does Jack get beaten up, since when does Jack get lectured to and bossed around by a feminist (and then he apologises?), since when does Jack have a daughter, and since when was Major Turner such a bitch, and since when does Jack get lonely, and since when is Jack so slow (it was so obvious what was in the crates). In this movie Jack is a sensitive new age metro-sexual type of guy - to me that is unacceptable and a betrayal. And Major Turner was a dominant feminists with an agenda to prove herself equal to Jack (and did), and was clearly the one in charge. And why does Hollywood keep insisting on allowing a indolent rude arrogant idiot teenager to dominate the whole movie (just to appeal to teenagers). I saw a few people walk out and I was close to doing the same myself. I felt betrayed and angry - the teenager (allegedly Jack's daughter) was a complete annoyance. The real Jack would have told (this) Turner and the teenager to both get stuffed and he would have left. Jack would have caught the next bus out and found someone deserving of his help and commitment. Hollywood has killed Jack Reacher off - I will never go see another Reacher film. And I feel so disgusted that Lee Child has taken his 30 pieces of silver and allowed this (he is in the film again), that I will probably never buy another Jack Reacher novel. Quite frankly the last two have not been that good anyway.All things must come to an end, but it did not have to be this way. There are enough people out there that like Jack Reacher the way he is in the novels and would go to the movies (IMO). But Hollywood has copped out and pandered to the demands for strong (dominant) female roles, while also trying to appeal to the female teenagers at the same time. Jack is the third player in this movie - he is not the lead role.If you need to see it anyway - wait for cable or those free sites. You will be disappointed.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Story might have been OK with better writing – I mean, few men can get away with using the term 'Bitch Slap' unless it is in jest. For a woman? Ridiculous does not begin to cover it. A woman should never try and show more testosterone than the male lead  especially when he is feared and revered throughout the armed forces. Then there's the endless bad guys who are everywhere and know everything – and only a lowly female sergeant is there for help. Maybe the rest of the heroine's subordinates were men who hated her guts. Tom had the same persona as in the original, but that's where the similarity ends. Like too many movies and sequels, the movie relies on action instead of characters. I don't foresee a third Jack Reacher movie",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Women says ""we are being followed"" whilst wearing no bra with the tightest t-shirt ever , army fatigues and a cap in the middle of a suburban environment...
Arms raised in chopping motions whilst looking like carrying carpets under them in multiple running in scenes to make it feel like its action...
Manly female cast member ""clears"" a room by poking her head around one corner and not bothering to check the other....I really don't understand why screenwriters and authors feel that Women actors need to be portrayed like a man. Its almost like military reenactors pretending to be real military to make up for the fact they couldn't complete basic military training. These sorts of films are just the worst!
Cobie Smulders also proves that she received far too many big films since her debut with the Rock in walking tall.

192,tyingling7766,Reacher movies can be the next Bond movies,8,3 November 2016,"Went to watch Jack Reacher: Never Go Back last night. Amazing movie. Jumping right to it.Synopsis: Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name. On the run as a fugitive from the law, Reacher uncovers a potential secret from his past that could change his life forever. Starring: Tom Cruise, Cobie Smulders Director: Edward ZwickLike I said, it's an amazing movie. That's not to say that it had its flows. And a few of those flows are the same ones from the first movie. I'll get to those in a few minutes. First, let's talk about the good things.First off, this isn't a direct sequel to the first movie. The first movie was the ninth book in the series and this was the eighteenth book in the series. That really doesn't hurt the story though. The story is a little complex in the sense that Reacher accidentally walked into the situation. All he wanted to do was go buy a nice woman dinner for helping her out and vice versa. Turns out, the woman was caught up in a governmental conspiracy. Only Reacher can her it seems. Added into the problem the fact that Reacher's supposed daughter, Samantha, is a target as well doesn't help.My question is: how can Reacher continue to find himself in this types of situations? I'm basing that question off the books not the two movies. And that leads us into the few flaws.Of course, there are going to be some discrepancies from the book to the movie. The biggest being the fact that Cruise is almost a foot shorter and hundred pounds lighter than Jack Reacher in the book. I'm not saying that's a bad thing like a lot of people out there. Granted, I would love to see someone more the type take the role, but I'm fine with Cruise in the role.The second problem with the story is that the book this movie is based on is part of a trilogy of books in the Reacher series. In fact, it's the last part of the trilogy of books. Now, I have only read the first two books of the entire Jack Reacher series and I haven't made it to the trilogy as of yet, but from what I understand the part at the beginning of the movie came from one of those other books. It just hurts the story a bit. They could have spaced out the movies a bit and included all of the story for Turner (Smulders) and Reacher. That's just my opinion.The writing was superb, and that's not too surprising giving the author of the source material. The banter between Reacher and Turner, and Reacher and any of his enemies, and Reacher and Samantha, and Turner and Samantha was hilarious. It all worked great in the end.As a side note, I can see this series becoming the next James Bond series. There is enough source material out there for the series to go on for a long time seeing as Tom Cruise is not going to be young enough to play Reacher that much longer. Just do what they have done with James Bond by switching actors every so often. That is, unless, they start putting a Reacher movie out every single year.This movie is strongly recommended. I don't think I could recommend it anymore.Rating: 8 out of 10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
193,Pigeon_down,This is a Jean Claude Van Dame level movie B-,3,2 January 2017,"This is worse than part 1. Part was wasn't too bad, but this is plain awful. It is wrong on many levels - the plot is incredibly weak, the acting is awful, and the script is straight out of a 70s B movie. In an alternate universe this movie star Jean Claude Van Dame. However in this universe Tom Cruise appears to have failed miserably, as did direction, script writing etc.Corny lines like, ""They ran out of Medal"" when referring to how heavily awarded this former MP is, happen to be just one example amongst the many.Then there is the plot, the pointless proactive attempt by the bad guys to lock up and kill Major Smulders, follow Jack Reacher, create a professional baddie that takes things personally. This may well be the tipping point decline in the career of Tom Cruz, he just looked past it, slow, completely unbelievable.I won't say much more, this movie isn't worth wasting the time on the critique.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

I mean it's not the actors it's the script and the film itself I give it credit for the acting Tom Cruise is good as Jack Reacher and so is Cobie Smulders as Major Susan Turner but the story was bad,the writing was bad everything else was just bad I really wouldn't recommend this even if you're a fan of the original which I am this is Hollywood trash but they will keep making films like this because there will always be an audience for it I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters which I was going to but in the end decided against it I really have never been happier that I didn't do that don't waste your time watch a good action/thriller film instead I use that term loosely because like I said hardly any action and wasn't thrilling.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
195,Critomaton,"You know what they say: Once you go back, you never um... go back",5,27 October 2016,"...to see another Jack Reacher movie, that is. I really liked the first film and was anticipating this one. It was a huge letdown. I read the book Never Go Back and recall it being one of the better in the Reacher series. It was a while ago, but I think the movie was reasonably faithful to it. Still, this film felt very clichéd. In fact, ""clichéd"" isn't even the right word, nor is ""formulaic"". It was too bland for even those adjectives, which is almost an accomplishment in itself. Reacher had much less witty repartee in this film than in the first. There was a lot less mystery or suspense; it was pretty much just a ""fugitive road trip"" pic. The action scenes were uninspired and the lead villain was way too uninteresting to be so relentlessly unstoppable. I knew the movie would be bad when Reacher and his gal pal just ran away from the vicious killer when his back was turned in the restaurant kitchen, allowing him to kill two more people.The exciting car chase in the Dodge Charger police interceptor barely even happened. The car was used in two separate mini-chases, neither one of which had any of the intensity teased in the trailers. And, you know how it's clichéd that the hero and villain can get in knock-down drag-outs with brutal bone-crushing blows but nobody ever gets hurt? Well in this film they did something somewhat original yet somehow stupider:After Reacher and the bad guy fall off a rooftop onto a lower rooftop, they get into this weird fight where they are both keeled over from their injuries but still going at it. I guess there is ""good"" injured and ""bad"" injured. It reminded me of the ""good"" naked and ""bad"" naked from that Seinfeld episode.The entire subplot with his maybe-daughter was embarrassing. I know it's in the book, but it just didn't translate well to the big screen. Then at the end, there is an awkwardly drawn out goodbye scene that is supposed to be tear-jerking but just had me checking the time on my phone.The first Reacher film began with suspense and ended with Jack getting up from his seat to kick some ass again. This one begins after what would have been the most interesting fight in the movie and ends with Jack hitchhiking down some Nebraska highway with his toothy smile, like a cross between David Banner and Joel Goodsen. So it is bookended with the same disappointments that it is filled with.Cobie Smulders is nice, but when she turns into a female Jack Reacher it gets silly. And even for Jack Reacher, his ability to destroy his enemies on a plane without attracting attention is just unbelievable. It was funny when Arnold did it in Commando, not so much in what is supposed to be a gritty, realistic action thriller.The only pleasant surprise of the movie was Aldis Hodge. It was nice to see Hardison from Leverage in something else.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

203,gatsby601,Out of Reach,5,12 December 2016,"I've never read any of the Jack Reacher books but after the first movie I was tempted. The cliché 'Lone wolf looking for justice on his terms' character was elevated thanks to a decent performance by Tom Cruise and a pretty nifty mystery.The second film, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back - has a more then ironic title.The somewhat elaborate but still satisfying mystery of the first film is replaced here with the familiar formula of 'Kill all the bad guys until you reach the main bad guy.' Fresh!Speaking of dull, it was decided at some point that this action film needed a side story including a long lost daughter. Maybe to give it heart, make it more human, attract fifteen year old brats with daddy issues or to just make it less fun. Hard to say.Idiot daughter lives in an emotional vacuum, she witnesses violent death in one scene then whines about how nobody respects her in the next. At no point does she seem to process the fact that her life is in danger and just maybe Cruise is telling her what to do so she won't, you know, die. From bullets. Cause he's a soldier and maybe knows about these things.The real let down here is I continually got ahead of the characters. When supposedly smart people can't work out how the main villain is paying his bills by importing 'something' from the middle east you know there's a problem. Hummm..what could they smuggle back from Syria that is valuable enough to save a billion dollar company? Might rhyme with weroine!How Cruise go talked into slapping the Jack Reacher name onto this third rate script I don't know.Watch any action movie from the 1970s-80s instead of this snoozer.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

205,jezfernandez,Ruined by lazy scripting,3,4 March 2018,"First off the bat, I've never read a Jack Reacher novel and couldn't care less whether or not Tom Cruise looks like the bloke in the book. I enjoyed the first movie and thought it had an effective raw quality. Never Go Back, however, is a travesty. I won't divulge any spoilers, but I will highlight two main deficiencies.Firstly, plausibility is stretched to breaking point in this movie. Astonishingly incompetent law enforcement officers, plot inconsistencies (e.g. Reacher steals an ID card to get a flight, but his two co-fugitives don't seem to need one) and infuriating character decisions. Here's a tip - if you're being pursued by ruthless killers and you find a good place to hide, STAY THERE AND CALL THE POLICE FROM YOUR PHONE! Do not continually creep out of your safe spot to be pursued by said killers.The second major problem is the decision to bring in Samantha (Danika Yarosh), who may or may not be Reacher's daughter. Coupled with Cobie Smulders, are they trying to infer that Reacher is longing for the quiet family life? Possibly, but that dynamic is never fully explored, Ed Zwick instead recycling the same punch-ups, car-jackings and vintage Cruise sprints for most of the two-hour running time.Overall, Jack Reacher 2 is hampered by ludicrous set-pieces and character decisions that will have you howling, ""That would NEVER happen"" at the screen. It's impossible to engage with the story when it's crammed full of every conceivable Hollywood trope.Cruise should have heeded the strapline and never gone back for this sequel. Avoid.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
206,yerlo,Enjoyed it just fine,10,30 October 2016,"OK, I really liked it. Totally worth seeing. I have one complaint. The camera-work was hectic. Bits, pieces, flashes, snips, specs and quick tight shorts of body parts or a partial scenes or of stuff that I couldn't what it was because there was no flow to many of the stunts or fights. Fight scenes and stunts are choreographed, or should be, so the viewer can get the WHOLE action. Like a dance routine--you need to see the whole body/bodies executing the moves. Sports-if all you see is a blink long shot of an arm, a foot moving, tight on the ball going here and there for split seconds you are not watching the sport. You are watching some camera guy get his cookies with zipping in and dashing there. Maybe it's the editing. It' boring. Take a lesson from Jackie Chan. Every movie, every stunt and action scene is choreographed and you can see the WHOLE thing, not just a quick fist (whose is it?) by and--never mind. It's just chaos on the screen and it's hard to describe chaos. Cruise does better than this in other movies, why drop the ball on this one? Or was it a ball--don't know, the camera wasn't on it long enough to tell.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The acting of Tom Cruise's supporting group is just the worst. Tom always does a good job, but if he didn't this would have really been a mess. The whole story line of the daughter who isn't really a daughter could have been left out completely and it may have been a better movie.

210,imdb3-3,Laughably funny dialogue out of Sin City,2,3 January 2017,"This is an unintentional comedy. Here are a couple of lines between hero and villain.Good: Let's finish this. Just you and me.Bad: I'm gonna have some fun with your pretty little girl.Good: I'm gonna break your arms. I'm gonna break your legs. I'm gonna break your neck. What you hear is excitement.Bad: Nice try. I found a way to hurt you like you never hurt before.The whole movie is like this. It's straight out of Sin City without the fun, wit and memorable characters. And the cinematography. It's Cruise being Cruise, the baddest, smartest and most kick-ass guy on the planet. He only has $40 in his pocket but somehow he's always being able to afford a half decent lifestyle. This is the stuff of dumb pulp fiction, without any of the appeal. The acting is terrible. The female lead is stiffer than a redwood. There is zero chemistry between Cruise and the female lead making the premise of this film preposterous. And the deadliest villain of all is about as menacing as he is eloquent. (See the dialogue.)There is a reason why this film flopped at the box office. Because it's horrible. Even the story of how Reacher got into ""the twist"" is too dumb to be believed. No wonder no actor of repute would take this dud. They should never have gone back to the well. It was dry in the first place.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
211,johnfuen,Good popcorn chomping action movie,8,21 October 2016,"I'll start by saying that I am one of the readers of the Lee Child Reacher novels who railed against the miscast Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. Though I think Cruise does a good job of portraying the loner aspect of Reacher's personality, the magnitude of Reacher's Bad Ass quotient is lost due to the 10 inches or so difference in size between Cruise and the character described in the books. That said....I have to say that I enjoyed this movie more than the firstThis is definitely a good ""eat popcorn while watching the action"" movie. There were some plot holes.....but what action movie doesn't have them. Readcer after helping in the arrest of a crooked Southern Sheriff decides to head to Washington DC to meet the current Commanding officer of the MP unit Reacher used to lead. Upon arriving in DC, he discovers two things.....the new CO is under arrest for suspicion of espionage and someone is claiming that he is the father of a teen aged girl. The movie then follows Reacher and Major Turner (the new female CO) as he breaks her out of jail to try to find out who is responsible for the murder of two of her MPs and also to help unravel the story behind his alleged ""daughter'. There is plenty of action and a few good quiet character moments between Reacher and the Major and Reacher and the teen aged girl. For those of you who were fans of the TV show Leverage....Aldis Hodge (Alec Hardison the Hacker) has a pivotal supporting role and he did pretty good. If you come to watch this movie expecting deep social meaning or superb dialogue...you will be disappointed. If you come to forget the election and be entertained for two hours.....you will have REACHED your goal (sorry...couldn't resist)",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
212,tom-43722,Not terrible,4,28 October 2016,"This is an okay action film but there's very little to it aside from that. The acting was average. Nobody was terrible but nobody was particularly good either. Tom Cruise and Cobie Smulders were pretty bland. Danika Yarosh was a bit more interesting because she showed more variety in her expressions but she still wasn't very good. Also Yarosh looks a bit too old to be playing a fifteen year old. However, I did like Jack's relationship with Samantha. There wasn't a great amount of time devoted to their relationships development but I thought some of the scenes they had, particularly at the end, were quite sweet and even found myself feeling mildly concerned when Samantha was in peril. If she had actually been killed, this movie could have been more than just a bland action film, but as it is, it has nothing that makes it stand out.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
213,Venom_81,A medium TV movie,5,9 November 2016,"I really enjoyed the first Jack Reacher it was between a mystery thriller and an action, the script was solid the dialogue convincing, in the end a nice mystery thriller well done. OK the sequel as very few things in common with the first one. The story can be convincing for the first 30 minutes, Cruise is convincing as always the problem is the rest of the cast that doesn't seems to get the point. The mystery part is less efficient than the first movie, sometimes the script find very stupid reason to motivate something that happen. After the first hour you can guess step by step how the story can evolve until the end. Also the direction seems a bit poorly and too TV style than a movie style, so if you ask me to condense the review I can say : seems a medium TV movie for the story the direction and ,excluding Cruise, for the cast. If that is the direction of Jach Reacher I hope that there will not be a third movie",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
214,jerry07,Terrible reboot of an awaited sequel,4,11 March 2017,"I really enjoyed the initial Jack Reacher movie (from 2012) and thought of it of an action packed exulting movie. In fact, it was near a discovery for me (did very well in the super & anti-hero genre) so, you can imagine the heighten expectation when I saw a second installment was out.But this new Reacher is anything but exiting. It was blend and highly predictable at best. Scenes succeed each other with sometimes lack of cohesion and depth, the story is horribly simple and cliché and the plot is laced with nonsensical chases and mind flashes (that are supposed to explain what is happening?). How did Jack even figure out what the story was all about near the very end ... while I had figured out 1/3rd through? We would even be tempted to ask ourselves how many military highly ranked people were involved in this plot-line (and why and how the villain characters were really related to each other) ... but by the end of this movie, we do not even care of questioning the perceived incoherence. Don't get me wrong though - I felt Cruise gave a fine performance overall - the script and orchestration of the movie in its final cut is just terrible.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
215,gnix1979,A good sequel,8,1 November 2016,"Considering I gave the first Reacher film a 10, its the movie that got me hooked on the Jack Reacher books. This movie however was really good and really enjoyable, however the story is a little diluted/not as gripping as the first but non the less really good.In spite of the Tom Cruise haters, he manages to pull of the character again very well, a lot of commentators criticise his height as Reacher is well over 6ft, were as Tom Cruise if roughly 5,6in, but they fail to recognise the fact that he plays the character fairly accurately such as his fallibility and his tenacity to get in and out of trouble, which he does on many occasions in this movie.There were one or two bad points such as Aldis Hodge's character Espin, when he is initially introduced you would think he would play a bigger part, he is initially a likable character and acted very well, but his screen time is incredibly short and only ever serves as a character to help move the plot along, which isn't really a bad thing but would liked to have seen more. There was also a moment when he almost broke character or forgot he was playing an MP, but he can be forgiven for that.Not familiar with Danika Yarosh's work but based on this movie, she has a lot going for her. She looks like sibling of Anna Paquin.Moving forward with the Jack Reacher franchise I think they should consider stopping with this movie and consider turning it into a good replacement for 24. Considering there are over 20 books for source material (18 if you exclude the two movies, more as long as Lee Childs keeps writing) there are plenty of good books in the series to make a good TV series, this book wouldn't have been my choice for a sequel when there were slightly better choices. Cruise could even take a step back and simply produce the show and get another actor to play the Reacher role if he was happy with that. I am sure it would appease the haters anyway.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
216,LightningB,Nauseating daughter character,4,11 April 2020,"I really enjoyed the first one. They picked a good novel to make first film. This one.....good frickin night! From the less intriguing story to the more generic bad guys to the, holy crap, god-awful daughter character. She's obnoxious, careless and is never accountable for her constant self-centered actions. Not sure what the makers of this flick were going for as they continued with that character. She's portrayed in a whiny fashion but it's clear we're supposed to view her as an emerging, strong, independent young woman. So if that's not missing the mark in this case I'm not sure what it is.And despite the obvious physical differences that Tom Cruise has in contrast to how the characters in the books I still think he pulled it off in the first film. This one he just seems too ordinary. The fight at the end was something Reacher in the books doesn't experience: a dragged out one. He ends things decisively.But whatever flaws this film has could probably have been looked over without the fingernails-on-chalkboard daughter. I don't care that this is based on a book. Minimize her in a way that her input is more valuable by the less-is-more method. If we were ever supposed to actually feel sorry for her they should do the opposite to make that happen.It's unfortunate that this movie put an end to them making more movies because Jack Reacher books are great story after great story. Maybe they'll actually make it decent with the TV series coming up on Amazon. Here's hoping anyways.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
217,AussieMovieReviews,Turn off your brain and watch,7,9 January 2017,"7/10. Jack Reacher is back again, on the run to clear his name and uncover the truth. Directed by Edward Zwick who also did Blood Diamond (2006) and The Last Samurai (2003). He is back working with Tom Cruise again, and does a fine job. This is a popcorn movie that is just a bit of far fetched fun. Tom Cruise is good, and is up to his usual standards. His partner in crime Cobie Smulders is also fine, not much chemistry chemistry between them though. As I often say, if you want to turn off your brain and just see a fun action flick, then this is for you. I did enjoy it. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back #jackreachernevergoback",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
218,Brandon_Walker_Robinson,"Thanks for coming back, Jack!",5,18 October 2016,"I definitely enjoyed it, though I would be remiss to say that I do not remember very much about the first film. I even re-watched the trailer, re-read some of my own impressions on it from a few years ago, and honestly a lot of it doesn't ring a bell. Some scenes here and there do, but I won't be able to draw any real comparisons for anybody. Not remembering it much though, I think it's safe to say you can see this one without seeing the first one if that's what suits you. Any connection that might have been there flew right by me, and everything is plenty coherent without it.Now, if I felt the first film was strong enough despite its flaws, I think I can say the same for this one as well. I think the first one was more of Tom Cruise playing a more impenetrable character, whereas you get him only slightly more grounded this time around. There are reasons for his shield to be a bit lowered though, and I thought those aspects of the film worked out great. My two biggest complaints about JR1 was that one of the baddies was unnecessary and the latter half of the film dragged a little. I didn't think JR2 felt drawn out at all, and any ""baddies"" were serviceable.It wasn't riddled with far too many laughs (there were some, don't worry) and there wasn't anything in the action that will separate itself from the pack, so it's just a matter of whether the story will pull you in enough. I'll just bite and say that Cruise was my major draw. Without him I'm sure the film would be just fine (and as I said about the first one, I would have almost preferred seeing it without him in a way), but he's a likable action star and is in that last decade of not getting a little more on the senior side of things, so let's enjoy every bit he has to offer until then! Dialogue was hit-and-miss, a few moments were predictable, and direction wasn't the most ambitious... but for $68 million, what are you going to do?I don't know who asked for a sequel, but whoever did I'd say they certainly answered. Will you be alright missing this from your catalog someday? I think you'll be fine; it's good even though it's not the most original thing done. But I liked what was brought to the character (never read the books) and I think that kind of element is perfect for cinema. It worked, and it worked well even as a standalone film. Despite some films in my Blu-ray collection I can easily see this surpassing (I'm looking at you, Paycheck), it does take a little more novelty in the entertainment factor for me to say that it's going to fly on my shelf. I still do recommend it for those willing to give it a shot. You like Cruise? You'll like this.The title may pertain to the film's story, though it's certainly not the most fitting, especially for audience members... we are glad he went back! Made for an impressive sequel that ultimately struck more interpersonal heartstrings than less. By the time the credits rolled, I can say that this film should be able to lodge in my memory much better than the first film even if I hypothetically never saw it again. Speaking of which, the end credits music felt a bit out of place and gave me a laugh. Didn't stick around to see if there were any after-credit things, but I don't know if this film franchise would be pushing for that kind of thing anyway.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Jack Reacher: Never Go Back however is one of only a very select few movies where the sequel matches the quality of its predecessor as Tom Cruise returns to the big screen in a positive way. While some of the story and action scenes were a little cliche and predictable it's to be expected and every so often in the movie the action went from cliche to tremendous. I've never been much of a Tom Cruise fan but he's slowly starting to grow on me and this is just another thumbs up from me for him.

JR is inside a diner. We don't know what exactly happened or why it happened. But of course JR is responsible. Not even sure why this scene was there. It serves absolutely no purpose or story enhancement.There are so MANY plot holes it is impossible to keep count. JR may have a daughter, conveniently he finds her almost instantly. Guys with guns never used them properly or hit JR.The scene when he is in prison and talking with his attorney, at the exact moment he is looking outside the window (convenient), he sees 2 bad guys coming in. They of course look the part, and park right outside the window at the exact time JR is looking outside. He then gets his lawyer to go get him a sandwich and she leaves her briefcase and wallet behind. JR then proceeds to escape a maximum security prison with little effort.It goes on and on like that. He spots his 'daughter' in a huge Halloween parade in New Orleans, with literally thousands of people on the streets. It is really a terrible injustice to Lee Child and his wonderful novels.

225,Hbarker-32233,well... It's better than The Accountant,4,21 December 2016,"The thing about Tom Cruise is that he's always ready to go, up for everything and giving ten thousand percent. That laser-focused intensity can be a bit much sometimes (Cruise is never funnier than when the joke is on him and never worse than when he's trying to be funny) but it's served him well in his unexpected, mid-life decision to make himself over into the American Jackie Chan. Back in the eighties and nineties Tom Cruise used to headline Oscar contenders. These days he's doing his own stunts in punchy, populist action pictures you go see with your uncles.Cruise never half-asses it, though. The Missions: Impossibles Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation are modern classics of go-for-broke showmanship, ditto his prankishly clever sci-fi Groundhog Day by way of Normandy, Edge Of Tomorrow. Even 2012's lo-fi bruiser Jack Reacher had the hardscrabble appeal of an old Walter Hill picture, complete with one hell of a car chase. Alas, I wish I could say the same for its sequel.Given Cruise's reputation for quality control, the most surprising thing about Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is just how lousy it is. This is a shoddy, cheap-looking affair lacking any of the polished production values or death-defying stunt sequences we've come to expect from Tom Cruise movies. It takes place mainly in nondescript, soundstage motel rooms and in front of green-screens so unconvincing that I looked up the budget as soon as I got home and now I'm wondering where Paramount's $96 million went. This thing could pass for a sweeps-week episode of NCIS.The first Jack Reacher was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who has since been promoted to run the Mission: Impossible franchise for Cruise, while Reacher duty has fallen into the less-than-capable hands of Edward Zwick, a prestige picture gasbag whose The Last Samurai was one of the only Tom Cruise movies I ever actively hated. Zwick's enlisted his longtime TV co-writer from thirtysomething and My So-Called Life, Marshall Herskovitz, to re-write a screenplay by Richard Wenk based on one of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels that I probably must have read but can't tell you for sure.(Seriously, I zipped through like a dozen of these one summer and they're so much fun and you forget them the very next day. Child's books all sort of of bleed together and the titles are so generic, I only stopped picking them up when I realized I have no idea anymore which ones I've read.) Cruise, never more comfortable than when playing a Nietzschean Superman, returns as the leather-jacketed drifter, an ex-Military Police investigator going Greyhound from town to town, insulting authority figures and righting wrongs. We catch up with him in the midst of a phone flirtation with his replacement MP, Major Turner (Cobie Smulders) but their date night is abruptly canceled when she's arrested for espionage.Of course she's been framed. It's all part of a resoundingly uninteresting and twist-deprived mystery involving a team of Halliburton-esque contractors, led by a Central Casting villain billed only as The Hunter and played by Patrick Heusinger with about that much specificity. (The first film had Werner Herzog as the bad guy. Obviously an impossible act to follow, but maybe somebody could have at least tried?) A not-bad sequence finds Reacher busting Turner out of the brig, and we're on the lam with a distinct absence of immediacy.The two are soon saddled with Samantha (Danika Yarosh), a petulant fifteen-year-old who might-or-might-not be Reacher's daughter from a half-remembered assignation. There are hints here of a screwball, surrogate-family comedy, with Cruise and Smulders as a couple of hard-ass, hilariously unfit parents who can bust heads with the best of them but haven't the slightest idea how to talk to a teenage girl. Cruise in particular is working about five levels above the material, suffusing Reacher's comically incompetent attempts to act like a dad with an undercurrent of yearning that screams out for a better movie.Cobie Smulders falls neatly into the Paula Patton/Emily Blunt/Rebecca Ferguson role of Cruise's ass-kicking female foil, and though he can't ever seem to muster up much chemistry with any of them it's still very cool to see an action star always yielding the floor to powerful women. Smulders is amusingly gruff and I liked watching the two of them together, even when the filmmakers try to cheat Cruise's height so much in their motel room scenes that it looks like he's standing on the bed.But none of the maybe-daughter stuff even goes anywhere and I still can't believe how pedestrian these action sequences are. Cruise has one or two fun moments when he gets to punch people out, but nothing memorable like the fight outside the bar or that close-quarters bathroom brawl in the first film. I assumed this movie couldn't possibly look hackier and more worn-out than the airport tarmac plot revelations, and then Zwick throws in a New Orleans rooftop climax that looks like it was shot on a backlot in Burbank. Sorry, but once you've seen Tom Cruise hanging from the Burj Khalifa watching him almost fall off a cheap set left over from an eighties cop show isn't exactly wow material.The nicest thing I can say about Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is that it's better than The Accountant.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

228,lincolnhawk-87377,A Lame Movie Based on a Lame Book,1,4 September 2020,"This movie is the equivalent of elevator music, it played along dully and pleasantly, barely registering, not disturbing me in the slightest as I washed the dishes, played some online Scrabble and searched for other movie recommendations on my phone. This is what happens when you make a movie based on an uninspired character from a by-the-numbers ""action hero"" book written by a not particularly talented writer. I tried to read one of the books and found that it couldn't hold my interest, I had to get off the elevator at the next floor. Many reviewers express outrage at Cruise playing the character of Reacher, explaining that Reacher is supposed to be a 6'5, 250lbs, blond ""force of nature"" (the Ivan Drago of ex-military police) and demand that the movie makers stop ruining Lee Child novels. Yes, you could accurately cast the Jack Reacher character with someone meeting the physical statistics detailed in the books, but the movies would still be trite and throwaway as a result of the weak source material. The reason Cruise opted to use the Reacher books as a movie vehicle is because he knew he would have an easy, zero effort franchise opportunity with a massive viewer base on his hands. Pick a grocery checkout rack bestseller lapped up by the non-discerning masses, bang out a few screenplays and cash in. I'm sure that he had himself cast in the title role because it feels nice to relive his glory days and still be able to see himself as an action hero. Apparently the rights have been taken over by Amazon and the next vehicle will be a TV series; I'm sure Amazon will please the rabid fans, cast a large blond man to play the lead role and churn out season after season after season, much like Child has churned out book after book after book for decades. Apparently the books are all ""self-contained"" stories and rely little, if at all on preceding books in the franchise. As such, you will probably be in store for little Jack Reacher A-Team style adventures to fill your boots for at least a decade, fans. Maybe they can slap a blond wig on Batista or some other wrestler-turned-actor and give you what you deserve. Enjoy!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Having Cobie Smulders as the tough major that was going to punch Tom Cruise to see who goes search was a joke, noone makes a fist like she did if they know anything about fighting or has any fighting background. This movie is like so many others that the first movie was good so they let the star actor have more say into what happens with the character and it ruins the whole idea. They are actors not writers. Stick with what your good at and leave the other jobs to the professionals that are good at those jobs. You would think studios would have figured it out by now that writers are good at writing stories and actors are good at acting out the story.

234,RageQuitLeigh,Good but not as good as the first,8,1 January 2021,"In short summary this is a decent and thoroughly enjoyable action movie that fails to live up to the original.The sequel doesn't really follow on from the first movie in any real storyline so could quite easily be watched independently.The plot sees Reacher quickly find himself in the middle of a military police matter following the arrest of a Major. The movie seeks to see Reacher uncover the truth.It's a well made movie with some great action and enjoyable fight scenes and Tom Cruise puts in another decent performance. However the story is fairly predictable.l and some of the military characters are very cliche.Having watched the original and thought it was excellent, I feel there is something missing, that being said I enjoyed it from start to finish. Shame there isn't anymore.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
235,joeygvlahakis,Mission possible!!!,7,24 January 2017,"I have always been a Tom Cruise fan and he does not disappoint in this sequel.Even though the story line and plot is nothing new, it still manages to capture one's attention.The characters are very believable and the on screen chemistry is very touching. They're a few scenes i need to re watch when the movie becomes available on DVD, for example how Reacher is able to punch through car windows without breaking his hand and apparently it's very easy to buy airplane tickets with stolen credit cards.I still enjoyed the first movie much more however this one was able to provide a few good laughs, I also enjoyed the fact that the action is not over stylized. In my opinion I felt the movie needed another ten more minutes to explore the relationship between Reacher and the girl, this could be used in a follow up film (hint, hint)",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
236,thenza,A bit of a Reach,6,6 November 2017,"I enjoyed the first installment of this series so I was willing to give this movie a try with an open mind considering it was a lazy Sunday and I know the format of most action movies. The first 30 minutes of this movie was enjoyable but somewhere after Tom Cruise met with Cobie Smulder's character it turned into the typical cliché chase movie. I found myself telling my friend who walked in half way though the movie that in many parts of this movie there was many moments where you have to suspend your disbelief. Such that, a lot of the plot and the tying in of major points were just ways for the story to continue, at first I just assumed that Cruises training would come into play which is entertaining but later on it was just a masquerade of plot devices that were used to explain or not explain how they boarded a plane or sought refuge here or escaped or what not. The most unbelievable is Cruise hiding behind a shelf in the kitchen... um hello he's right there in plain view almost laughable. The dialogue became weak as well: ""I'm going to break your legs, then your arms, then your neck"" geez what else. The whole young girl that they have to protect I also found cliché', I wish what they did right in the first quarter of the movie would continue, but no the enemy was the typical 'bad guy' Ill do anything to finish off Reacher and he couldn't be stopped until the cliché again final fight scene. It was a little disappointing because the things that did work well in the first one such as plot development, well thought out fight scenes, and more plausible death defying action sequences wasn't the key focus in this movie. But what I do learn from both movies is: if you need to escape a crime scene or in desperation jump on a bus.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Its engaging, funny, and promises future action and mystery. Tom is in his element and he's better than ever at delivering those famous cheesy one-liners.About a third of the way into the film something happens. The focus shifts to a extremely lame sub-plot that wasn't called for, wasn't necessary, and adds nothing to the story. Characters begin acting in a completely different manner and for no apparent reason. I don't want to spoil anything but once you've reached this point (and you will know) the movie is completely predictable and fails to have any clever twists or produce excitement.What a huge disappointment and its fair to say I will never go back to watch this again.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

And then there's this father-daughter issue that was never a good plot in an action film. The action was GOOD, but the film was not GOOD. What is the meaning?The action was GOOD; we cannot remove that from Tom Cruise, he is good at this. But the film was not Good; The plot is flat, means it's normal and was already been used to many films. The never go back title also doesn't apply, never go back but the half of the film was filmed outside his city.

240,KristianZacc,Tom Cruise Is Gonna Tom Cruise... Just Not In This Movie,5,25 October 2016,"Minor/Vague SpoilersTom Cruise returning to this franchise was an interesting choice considering it plays as more of a Mission Impossible light. The sequel to the 2012 film Jack Reacher was a surprise to see for me since I didn't think the original was very successful to begin with, but I guess anything with Tom Cruise in it makes it a better product as a whole or does it?Just getting the negatives out of the way I thought some of the dialogue and writing in general was pretty bad. There were a few times I had to catch myself and think, ""Did they really just say that?"" Some of the lines just didn't feel like real people would be saying these things. There were also a lot of cheesy dialogue, specifically in a warehouse scene, and it just felt really out of place in this film. The whole ""Major, ex-major"" got old very fast. They also decided to use Tom Cruise's keen ability to spot out people who are following him most of the time but decide he can't do it aptly when it suits to move the plot forward. The storyline itself was pretty boring and felt really stretched out over the course of the two hours. Speaking of which after the first hour I found myself checking my watch quite a bit and couldn't believe there was so long left. If you feel like you've seen this story done before it's probably because you have. It's the same storyline in every generic action film; guy gets framed for something he didn't do, then guy tries to solve this problem and catch the villains. The only difference for this one is that he is doing all of this with Cobie Smulders's character. This action film felt like they were trying to make it more of a drama with action elements involved. Which can definitely work and there are past examples to prove this but here it fell flat and the characters and writing weren't strong enough to carry through the two hours. The inclusion of his probable daughter Sam, played by Danika Yarosh, gave Cruise someone else to play off of. She played an angst ridden teenager that basically just got in the way and was essentially a plot device to get to the final battle with the villains.The main assassin hunting for Reacher was a total nothing in this movie. As well as Robert Knepper who wasn't given nearly enough to do. I loved him in Prison Break, had no idea he was in this film, and to see the movie play out with him barely in it hurt me. I feel like the chemistry between the two of the three main characters was off most of the time but towards the end I did actually enjoy the relationship that Reacher and his daughter had because they tried to make him a real person with emotions. This, at first seemed great because they will actually give an action hero some character development but it just isn't done very well. This goes back to the films writing problems. I realised after watching this film that this is actually the first Edward Zwick film I have seen and I would hope that when I do go back and watch his past films they don't let me down as much as this one has. I haven't read the novel so maybe it plays better if you have, although knowing book adaptations they probably changed most of the plot. The great Tom Cruise, the only positive thing in this film, deserves better.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
241,gaijin-77282,Tom Cruise wants us to like him.,6,4 June 2020,"I'm admittedly not a fan of Mr. Cruise but that doesn't mean I refuse to watch his movies. This was a fairly fast paced thriller with the usual nastiness from the villains (if they aren't nasty enough we couldn't cheer on Tom as he beats them to death). My particular objection is the way the movie tries to manipulate my point of view so that I will cheer him on, marvel at his body and generally ''like'' him. Oh yes, Mr. Cruise wants to be liked by all of us and by starring in this sort of movie (which he also produced) he chips away at our objection to his real life antics.

Of course Agent Hill, but especially the cute, lovable, baby hating, and trigger happy sociopath Robin Scherbatsky. Having said this, I have to admit she ruined the Jack Reacher Experience for me. Jack Reacher is entertaining because it features pure bigger-than-life, lonesome-rider machismo: ""There is no Jack Reacher in team""! He is bad-ass and nobody else is, except maybe much less so the villain. This worked excellent in the first instalment, the adding of Robin - sorry Major Turner - ruined it. And I have to emphasise, this is not a gender issue. I would like to see a: ""Jackie Reacher"" movie, starring Cobie Smulders or Angelina Jolie or Sigourney Weaver or Milla Jovovich or or or!

This just fails miserably brewing the suspense in the story, compound that with poor dialogues from Reacher. Somehow the way agent Turner's apprehension setting Reacher's mission doesn't feel settling.What I hate the most, fake romantic scenes !

247,herman-787-132796,The promising action thriller movie succeeded deliver emotional bond between characters,7,26 October 2016,"Enter the 2nd movie of Lee Child's Jack Reacher ""Never Go Back"". Adaptaded from one of the best of Jack Reacher's. It all starts Jack Reacher arrested for beat the hell up 3 or 4 men outside of a café in small town. Reacher didn't run,but sit there – maybe ordered a cup of coffee or waffle – we don't know.But he just sit there till a sheriff arrived and order his deputy to arrest Reacher. But Reacher is so calm and say that a public phone on the wall will ring in 90 seconds and the sheriff will going to jail instead. The sheriff underestimated him, made fun of him that Reacher is one hell of a prophecy and just a second before his deputy walk Reacher outside, the phone rang. And it happened, 3 MP cars arrived and arrest the sheriff (along with his friends that Reacher already beat the hell up) for a serious crime committed in the land property of US Army.So,Reacher call Major Turner, a middle rank MP Officer who he informed about that sheriff, and Reacher is about to take a visit and if lucky he might get a date, but then when he arrived it was somebody else sit on the desk, Colonel Morgan that informed him that Major Turner has been arrested for espionage. Reacher didn't buy it, his got telling him that something might went wrong. Then Reacher find a way to meet Turner's appointed lawyer Col.Moorcroft, instead of minimum information, Moorcroft gave him another information that after he left the service as an MP, a suit has been addressed to US Army to pay child subvention by Candance Dayton a mother to Samantha, Candace claimed that Samantha is Reacher's daughter – which Reacher denied, but still he stole Samantha's photo, and before he left he satirize Moorcroft's. Reacher begin to find for Samantha, they both met but Reacher didn't tell her why is he following her.Finally Moorcroft follow his conscience to inform Reacher that something awkward in Turner's case, but an ex military soldier – the hunter- came by and killed him. Then Reacher blamed for Moorcroft's dead and arrested, and for worse an MP officer Cap. Espin – who hold grudge – that Reacher once hold his rank promotion with ""thoughless"" act judgment. But it's not Recaher if then he decided to lose himself from Espin, and release Turner from her cell block, just after 2 of unknown personnel entered the cell to kill her. Both manage to runaway, and became a couple of fugitive an at a time both marked for death, and on the run Reacher found out that Samantha also marked, because Samantha allegedly is his daughter, and then three of them must play hid and seek from town to town. As both Reacher and Turner digged out that a weapon contractor – Parasource- is involved in the killing of Turner's subordinates whom she sent to Afghanistan to investigate. And this time Reacher is running against time to find out what kind of conspiracy happen and to protect Samantha a girl allegedly his daughter.This is the second movie from Jack Reacher's character - even though Tom Cruise is not exactly as Lee Child's profile- but seems like Tom manage to present his own image as Jack Reacher – kind like Harrison Ford did as Jack Ryan in Tom Clancy's Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. What I like in this movie area : the chemistry bond between these 3 characters, Reacher-Tuner and Samantha. How the arguing between Reacher and Turner about who will go out finding some clue while someone has to take care of Samantha – and it's all about male – female equality, and gave me glimpse about Turner's character background that she was so sick about the way all men treat women in all field. Edward Zwick work the chemistry between Reacher and Turner very good, that's sometime Turner shows the shrouded ego to prove that she also can solve their big problem as well as Reacher. And in just a little while then she couldn't hide her symphaty,her admiration, her desire on Reacher – that behind he hard attitude she admit that she really can count on Reacher alone.I also like the chemistry between Reacher and Samantha, how Reacher it's kind of stranded between his confidence that Sam is not his daughter and at the same time for the first time he feels his fatherhood inside, that he will do anything to protect her.So this is a little bit awkward, this is an action thriller movie – I'm not saying that this movie is not thrill enough – but it's nothing so great about for the action pack, and the hand to hand combat – which is good enough, but I feel like even though you don't have to make it like a mindless moves, I think they should learn some of martial arts like jujitsu,pencak silat, kick boxing and karate, cause I don't really see that in both sequel. But still, all credits given to Tom Cruise, Cobie Smulders and Danika Yarosh that give soul in this movie. My conclusion is Jack Reacher : Never Go Back is an up to level from the first Jack Reacher (a.k.a One Shot in novel version), closer as the promising action thriller movie succeeded delivered emotional bond between characters but still halfway from it's original book - since Never Go Back is one of Lee Child's Jack Reacher Top 10 Best.Rate : 7 / 10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
248,kriscgis,"Dull, boring, had to fight to keep awake",3,2 November 2016,"This film was really tiresome. Clichéd plot, dreadful soundtrack. Lots of loud whacks and 'kapows' every time someone threw a punch, and there were lots of them. Lots of people running after other people, in ridiculous 'super hero' legs-up style. NO-ONE runs like that in real life.There is NO WAY that fourteen-year old girl part was fourteen - the actress looked nothing like a young girl, no matter how many times she pulled teenage-style faces.Worst of all, being a Tom Cruise production, starring Tom Cruise, we got to see an awful lot of close up shots of...Tom Cruise. Talk about vanity! His chubby aging face kept taking centre screen constantly. yes, Tom, we know you have a beautiful face, but it added nothing at all to the plot of the film and was simply...boring.I had to fight very hard to keep my eyes open.Clint Eastwood on the other hand directs superb movies and manages to sustain a good plot.Tom Cruise, do take some lessons from Clint.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
249,mydistracteduniverse,No matter what JAck Reacher is always fun!,7,26 December 2016,"Jack Reacher - Never Go Back Jack Reacher is back. This time he returns to Washington and he finds himself in a bit of a predicament. In his own special way he goes about setting things right.Spoiler Alert!This is an in depth review of the movie. Please be aware that I discuss the story, therefore some spoilers are inevitable. Read on at your own discretion.Initial ThoughtsLet's face it. When a short dark haired man pretends to be a tall light haired giant then something's gotta give and someone is losing out. Unfortunately in this case it's the audience who is losing.I have loved Tom Cruise since I first saw him in Legend all those years ago. He is a great actor and he made some great movies. But he should stick to playing Ethan Hunt. Because he's not Jack Reacher. I'm sorry.Having said that - it's not all bad. In fact it is a great movie. I enjoyed watching it. Actually I had planned on seeing a different movie but quickly changed my mind when I realized that Jack Reacher was out because I had been looking forward to the film since I saw the first trailers.The StoryJack Reacher heads back to Washington to meet up with his successor in the 110th, Major Susan Turner. They've spoken on the phone a few times and he is curious. And as he does not have much else to do, being a drifter and all, he decides to make his way to D.C. and check her out. Maybe invite her for dinner. That's the plan anyway.But we all know - the best laid plans never really work out and so it is not surprising that Reacher does not find Turner on his arrival. What he finds is trouble. And he finds himself slapped with a paternity suit.Turner is in jail on charges of treason, which Reacher's gut tells him is a big pile of baloney. When he begins to ask questions he finds himself re-enlisted and with the possibility that he has a child he didn't know of.After springing Turner from jail they go on the run, trying to figure out who is after them. Reacher finds the girl who is supposedly his daughter. She is a street smart kid with a habit of recreational shoplifting. As it turns out now she is in danger too and they take her with them. As they move along several people they were in contact with end up dead.Bit by bit they piece the story together. Turner had send a team to Afghanistan to investigate the disappearance of a truck load of weapons, that should have been shipped back to the US as the troops pulled out of there. Unfortunately the team got killed by what Turner assumed was someone on the inside. When she started to investigate the murders someone higher up stepped in and had her arrested on trumped up charges of treason.From Washington they move on to New Orleans for the big show down. The bad guys get what they are due and then some. The big boss is almost getting away; luckily Reacher and Turner get help from an unlikely source when it counts and all is well that ends well. Hollywood style.VerdictOne thing is certain. Tom Cruise may not be six foot five but he is in great shape. And he still knows how to do awesome stunt and fight scenes. He and Cobie Smulders bounce the story beautifully off each other.Jack Reacher - the movie is about as far removed from Jack Reacher - the book as possible, without having to change the name. It's a good movie though. It would have been a better one if I hadn't read the book, together with all the other books in the series. The story moves along swiftly and is filled with action from start to finish. I kind of hope they'll make another movie one day. I'm sure Lee Child still has got a few stories up his sleeve. After all he just released Jack Reacher 21. Although I haven't read that one yet. Keep your eyes peeled for a review in the future.Overall I will give the movie about 7 out of 10. Its not the greatest movie ever made; nonetheless it is very entertaining. Do you have to watch it in the cinema? Probably not. It will come out on Netflix soon enough I imagine.One question remains though. Why does Jack Reacher in the movie never gets the girl?",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

254,tomas1810,Worth viewing it,8,23 October 2016,"In 2012 Jack Reacher has positively surprised me and well entertained over long distances, which I had described as a successful crime film with many strengths, but storyline weaknesses. Now Tom Cruise comes back in the same role a few years later, this time with director Edward Zwick, who with Blood Diamonds ten years ago delivered a smashing actiondrama. So the signs are good that the second part could be good enough.Many elements and moments, which already worked in Jack Reacher, and as well in many other great action films, also shine over here. On the one hand, it is Cruise in his role of the quiet, effective investigator which is very believable, on the other hand, there are some surprise moments and well choreographed action scenes. They do not superimpose the film, however, so that Cruise does not have to fight every five minutes and is running around the whole flick, but they are well-dosed and then brilliantly calculated. Even Cobie Smulders has the same effect, absolutely up to par with Cruise, and wherever she goes, no grass grows any longer.As well in Jack Reacher : Never Go Back not everything is as it is suspected or imagined from a higher point, and it becomes clear that both have to assert themselves against one or more opponents. Already in the first part the counterpart remained for us a bit pale and this shortcoming also shows itself in the continuation. Although Patrick Heusinger as a hunter is a really good figure, the expected back men, however, really get into the background, so it is up to him to maintain the threat scenario for a long time. He does this by means of words and effective action – and when teenagers are threatened, then you suspect right that someone here can be brutally brutal.Fans of the first part will be happy that next to action the humor comes not too short, even if Part 1 has brought something more with it. The handwriting of Zwick is also more classical, so Jack Reacher : Never Go Back appears less like a criminal-themed puzzle, which is to be solved and where Cruise and Rosamund Pike once investigate together, it acts more like a usual action movie. This is justified, but precisely this sense of a Jack Reacher and his questions that pointed to solve the case was that in my opinion in part 1 has positively distinguished the movie from typical action films. Even now, he continues to combine attentively, but the offside surprise effect and the joy ""to puzzle"" remains rather on the line.Conclusion: For me, Jack Reacher compared to Jack Reacher : Never Go Back is the slightly better version, even if the action is now with 118 minutes a little more streamlined. Still, I give the same amount of movie stars, because all in all, Edward Zwick has delivered a good action film that keeps the viewer entertained. Cobie Smulders, 18-year-old Danika Yarosh and Patrick Heusinger are also performing well and will be remembered in addition to Cruise. And who wants to know how the story of the silent Lone Wolf goes on, should watch Part 2.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
255,akcsj,Jack Reacher Never Go Back has me going back,7,2 November 2016,"When the First Reacher movie came out I was aghast that 5' 7"" Tom Cruise was to play a 6' 5"" character. After the second movie he is growing into the role. He really is starting to capture some of the intensity and character of Reacher which makes the books so enjoyable.This second movie in the franchise is more kinetic than the first which had a few longueurs where the action stopped so the plot was explained. This time, despite a few alterations to the book plot the action and the character of Reacher take precedence; and it works.The novel, Never go Back, is arguably the most personal of the books. It is a good choice for the movies because it supplies some background to the Reacher character.The movie continues the introduction of a character who in time will rival and surpass Bourne. Bourne really has nowhere to go beyond the dominant theme of corruption in the US security establishment. Reacher is a character who in time and if the flavour and themes of the books are followed will show the nature of freedom in a society like the US.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The story is basically Reacher finds out that Cobie Smulders character is in trouble or is set up and he's going to save her. Now what's cool about her character is that she's no damsel is distress, Cobie's character is a bad-ass like Maria Hill. Once Jack rescues her theirs this weird side story of Jack finding out he has a daughter and so he now has to protect a teenage girl and Cobie (sort of) because they are now on the run. The relationship between Cobie and Cruise is what I really enjoyed from the film plus the action/fight scenes/explosions. Overall I give the film a 6.5/10.

Reacher isn't even remotely the badass he was in the first one. He's like your average action hero guy you find in pretty much every other action hero movie.The plot is so redundant. I've seen this story like a thousand times already. The first movie's success was the mystery and the story, not the action bits. If you take the action out of the first movie, you still get a good story. If you take the action out of this one? You get pretty much nothing.The characters are very unlikable. A Major in-over her head is suddenly this manufactured badass. Cocky, disrespectful, and condescending. Neither is a likable trait. And sorry, her badassery is just not convincing at all. We get no history on her service or achievements, and suddenly she's this big shot taking out ex special forces like they're school kids. Where did this come from?And the kid is insufferable. Really just horribly written character added for manufactured tension.The first movie was nice because it was somewhat believable and the story immerses you while you watch. This one is just fiction screaming at you every single moment.It's also quite boring. Every scene is predictable, the story is predictable and that's about it.I'm just gonna pretend this movie never happened.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

261,kboi,A sleeper (in a bad way),3,18 November 2017,A real sleeper (literally). Is it fair for me to write a review where I drifted in and out of wakefulness? I think so. Cruise is fine as Jack Reacher. The very beginning of the movie was the best part. The problem with the rest of the movie is the story line was just plain silly. A very typical plot. Bad guys chasing the good guys. Good guys trying to find the answers. Big boring fight scenes. Enough said. At least I feel rested today.,Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The same goes for paintings, books, and movies. Lee Child is my kind of writer, neither too intellectual nor too simplistic (I think he's a very smart writer). I've read all of his Jack Reacher novels but one. This one (by mistake, apparently). The movie Jack Reacher: Never Go Back was a very good implementation of the book (which I'm now reading), and I can see how the writer/director, Ed Zwick, kept the basic plot and the flavor of the book while making it a very good movie and under 2 hours long (Richard Wenk was also the writer). And I don't understand why some people think Tom Cruise is too small (some people think size matters). He seemed like Jack Reacher to me.

It moves fairly fast. I still have a little problem with Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. Reacher is 6'5"" and 250 lbs. He was probably bigger that Tom Cruise by the time he was in 3rd grade. But once I get past that, it was pretty good. Good action, and Reacher can put bad guys in the hospital easily and very quickly, which he does often. And he always succeeds where others fail. I was thinking there would be more of a relationship with Major Turner but they kept their relationship strictly business, which also did not follow the book. Hollywood does that a lot.

I was so wrong. It's an atrocious piece of filmmaking, which has literally EVERY cliché in it, from the stroppy teenager to the Afghanistan reference to 'These people were under my command!!!!!!!' to the person in the control room shouting 'I want eyes on every asset they've got / I want to know everywhere he's slept in the last four years, I want to know how he takes his eggs, what his favourite flavour of ice cream is...'. This is why we need to stop Tom Cruise from producing his own movies, because he can't carry a whole movie on his own. The directing is atrocious and the script is disgusting. Tom Cruise is okay, but everyone else might as well have been picked straight from the street. There is literally NO ACTION UNTIL THE LAST SCENE.

The Jack Reacher concept is a SINGLE ""made for TV"" movie at best - certainly not Bourne or Bond movie franchise worthy.Trust me, watch ""Basic"" instead - it has Sam Jackson and Giovanni Ribisi - is the same concept pretty much; has the same crap acting (Travolta and Nielson *shudder*) - but with the added benefit of having Rosalyn Sanchez in it throughout.....",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

271,otacon23dav,Has it moments but not as good as the first,6,18 February 2017,"As I always enjoy watching Tom Cruise in films, this one was only a tad enjoyable with several flaws. Not as good as the first I say. Storyline was so so which the high point of the film wasn't really at the end. Chemistry between Tom Cruise's Character and Cobie Smulders' Character was sub par. Also acting from the TV actors was sub par as well.Let's start with those flaws first. TV actors with Film Actors and vice versa. While there are a handful of TV actors who can act portray different characters well and act well, there are still some who maintain the image they do on a TV series or film they are known for thus hard to see them acting in anything else. Cobie Smulders, known for playing Robin in 'How I met your mother', didn't fit the character she was playing. Not only did I kept seeing her Character ""Robin"", but also her character being a Major in the Military Police didn't fit her. Although she does star in The Avengers, for me it wasn't a strong point and only realised after checking her IMDb credits again. Aldis Hodge, known for starring in Leverage, was again sub par. There were a several scenes with both I reckon the TV stars could of acted differently. Robert Knepper, known for starring in Prison break, While I have seen him in other series and movies, he is an actor that doesn't maintain his character from Prison Break which is good to see him in it although his time was short. Directing was only sub par. Fight scenes were a bit slow and camera work all over the place and sometimes hard to see due to dark area and lighting from background gets in the way. Overall, I give this 6/10. If you just want a thriller action and don't mind a weak plot, then give this ago. Movie like this really should've had someone else cast as Jack Reacher and went straight to netflix.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
272,joshgerlach,Jack Over-Reached,3,21 November 2017,"The first Jack Reacher was decent. It had a decent script, it was decently acted, decently edited, decently scored. All- around decent. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back has none of those things. The script feels like it was cobbled together with fragments of incomplete ideas with no resolutions, which makes the pacing seem disjointed and the story unfocused with no clear plot motivators. The acting is disingenuous, with a surprising weak link in Cobie Smulders, who has proved herself more than capable in the past. Here she isn't very commanding in her role as an authoritarian Army Major. Danika Yarosh's abrasive, unlikable Mary Sue performance is especially weak. Perhaps Yarosh's nominal talent is best reserved for rubberized CW Dramas. Tom Cruise seems to want nothing more than to not be in this movie, an inference that's clear in every bland-as-paste read he gives. The Jack Reacher in the first movie was at least relatable and --to some degree-- likable. This Jack Reacher is a boring jerk. I saw a better performance from him in The Mummy. You would expect that the main character of the film would be able to keep the intrigue of the audience, but Cruise seems more invested in the paycheck than the character, which I'm sure is a symptom of the weak script. By far, the absolute worst transgression of this film is the score, which seems cut/pasted from every other cheap ""high- intensity action-thriller"" made-for-TV. It sounds terribly unoriginal, ill-fit, and often times doesn't make any sense where it queues up. It tries too hard to build tension, but isn't written well enough to do that, rendering it disinteresting, dissatisfying, and ineffective. It feels off-the-rack, rather than tailored. This film is so boring, I couldn't even find a way to make this review funny.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Makers of the movie should have spent more time improving the story. Action sequences are really dull. They try to look Jason Bourne like, but end up looking totally mediocre.

275,rugb,Wrong Direction,6,25 June 2018,"Never Go Back, indeed. I'm reviewing this long after seeing it in the theater and I haven't seen it since despite its availability on Netflix, Hulu, Prime. The disappointment I felt then is still palpable today, especially after recently re-watching the first film.There is little difference between the first and second films in terms of production level, casting, story line, etc. Yet it's the collective of many small differences and attention to detail that makes one film great and the other a dud. I gave this one a 6 because it satisfies fundamental aspects of an action film, and those who rated the sequel higher than 6 or liked it, consistently to gravitated to that point. However, the first film more than satisfies all that too, but then outshines the sequel in every other way, making it a complete film in my opinion. This sequel falls flat in all those other aspects.I think this film suffers very specifically from two problems - its comparison to the first film and its director. McQuarrie, who directed the first, is known more for his writing resume and has limited directing time, yet seems to understand the concept of satisfying action film fans while maintaining the continuity of a good overall film. Despite his short director resume, he has been consistent in action films.In contrast, Zwick, who directed the sequel, has an Oscar-sprinkled director resume, but is known for drama epics. It seems clear to me that there was a shortsighted agenda by producers to change the direction of the feel, politics, rhetoric or something, but it was a bad idea. Jason Bourne, which came out the same year, had the same problem even though is had the same director as previous sequels. That's why I think it is an agenda thing from the producers.Sequels tend to not be as good as the first, but usually because producers shamefully try to maximize capitalization on the success of the first film by skimping on big details like the director, the script and top actors in the followup film. However, Zwick and Greengrass wouldn't be cheap, plus top actors are still there and production levels alone keep the budgets high. Yet the first films in Reacher and Bourne still stand out so much more. Why? Attention to detail. Like a band's first album - they simply seemed to be trying to nail the small details in addition to the big ones.Producers of Reacher and Bourne either don't understand why the first films were good, or don't care. I lean toward the latter. They only want your money and their agenda pushed. They don't care about longevity. Dollars can be found in the next fad.Many reviewers have pointed out some of these flaws with the second film that were not in the first, or not as bad. Forced dialogue, implausible action scenes, all the good scenes in the trailer, hokey drama, flat/weak characters, cliche settings, and so on. I'll add these to it: The opening sequence was the only part of the sequel that seemed like the first film. I think that was strategic. If some people knew better, they'd never had gone in the first place. Next, Cruise didn't seem interested the entire film. He appeared to be going though the motions in many scenes, while he seemed to relish in the character of the first film. Smulders should've been a perfect fit for her role, yet her performance wasn't half as good as Rosamund Pike in the first film. Outside of Cruise and Smulders, there were no other memorable performances or characters. The first film had dozens of well-thought out and well-performed characters. Every actor was fitting and at least up to par in the first Reacher. I think its worst performance was the local detective, and he at least did okay. No other secondary role in the sequel reached his level. There was NOBODY like Jenkins, Courtney, Herzog or Duvall in the 2nd film and these were big names playing secondary roles in the first Reacher. But even the next level roles like the supposed gunman, the thugs at the bar and the victims on the river were well-played and fitting compared to just about everyone in the sequel. Even the brief scene by the auto store manager in the first film was better performed and more memorable than the roles of the entire sequel.Finally, the action scenes in both films can be criticized as unrealistic, and the final fight scene in the first film was one of the few things I didn't like in that one. But at least everything in the first film was plausible compared to the sequel. As one reviewer noted, the sequel stepped back into the cliches of the 90s for much of the action scenes. Maybe Zwick didn't know any better and they rushed through the details believing or hoping it would pass, just like the recent Jason Bourne film. It's as if they believe most people are dumb enough to believe some very stupid things (like remotely accessing CCTV cameras). Maybe people are that naive or simply that eager for ANY entertainment, but the IMDB ratings at least slightly show otherwise. If the direction of Reacher continues this way, I won't even consider going to the next one. I'd need some significant reassurances.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
276,derektetlow-459-856509,Second Jack Reacher Film Fails to Deliver,4,1 December 2017,"I loved the first Jack Reacher movie!! I thought it was well paced, intriguing, had intelligent dialogue, characters that had some emotional depth, great action, and the story was well executed and very interesting. Never Go Back tried to repeat the success of Jack Reacher, but failed for several reasons:1) In the first Jack Reacher film, Tom Cruise absolutely hit the exact tone that was needed to make the movie work. His character was intense when he needed to be, but was able to downshift into a desire to still see the case through yet not get too emotionally involved. But in Never Go Back, he cranked his character's sensitivity to such a low level that he almost appeared like he was completely dead inside. This pushed many of the scenes into coming of as incredibly unrealistic and fake. Cruise's character would have done much better increasing his character's emotion level up a little from the first film rather than down. Cruise went the wrong way in Never Go Back.2) Cobie Smulders is nice to look at, but she really can't act. The delivery of her dialogue seemed (most of the time) so over the top, labored, and forced. There were scenes where it seemed like she was just reading from a cue card. She was also miscast in Never Go Back. What was needed in this character was someone who was attractive and sexy, yet exhibited toughness at the same time. Smulders fit the mold for the former (almost too much), but not the latter. Again, a lot of her failure in this area was in her acting ability (or lack thereof). Someone like a Sandra Bullock, Gina Carano (her acting ability may be questionable, but she still an improvement over Smulders), or Demi Moore (10 years younger) would have been better casting choices for the part of Turner. I just couldn't buy Smulders being the head of a military police unit in the film – it seemed very implausible and unbelievable and, therefore, it kinda wrecked a lot of the movie for me.3) Some of the dialogue in this film was just downright corny and stupid. There were some scenes where it was so blatantly obvious that they were trying to capitalize on some of the great lines from the first Jack Reacher film. Although the dialogue was different in Never Go Back, the manner and circumstances where the aforementioned lines were delivered was so clearly recycled. As a result, it gave the movie too much predictability and made it somewhat boring. A good action-thriller gives you plot twists and doesn't telegraph where it's going, but in too many instances in Never Go Back, you knew exactly what was going to happen purely from the dialogue. In her defense, it wasn't all Smulders' lack of acting ability or her fault where her character failed –the sheer stupidity of some of the lines she had to utter did contribute as well.4) Never Go Back had some scenes that struck me as very implausible – like the characters being able to move from point A to point B in a matter of seconds (when in reality it would take several minutes) and human beings taking such a level of physical abuse that afterwards their faces would look like uncooked hamburger or their bones would be completely shattered, yet they had the stereotypical Hollywood small trickle of blood from the side of their nose or mouth. Oh please!! I would give the first Jack Reacher film an 8 or 9, but Never Go Back fell miserably flat and was only a 4. It just failed badly to live up to the expectations I had going in, almost to the point of not really looking forward to the next Jack Reacher filmif there is one.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Also I don't really watch a lot of action movies, I started watching it because I was in mood for a fast paced film on a boring Sunday evening. I am going to be short here and sum it up as this movie is a generic action movie, meaning there is a plot in the background and a lot of action for the sake of it. It lacks the stoic characters, the seriousness and a well written plot of the first movie.

Let's settle on ""watchable"".Really, Tom's getting a bit old for the action hero roles. How much longer will they keep casting him in these types of films I wonder.The title character, Jack Reacher, is a creation of novelist Jim Grant, better known by his pen name, Lee Child. To really appreciate the character you have to read at least some of the novels which, in my view, are a far better experience then watching a film based on them.Instead of making films based on the novels I feel a TV series could have been better. The characters and the story could be much more engrossing, creating ample suspense and ""attachment"". Who knows, some TV series producer could still snag the rights to create a series if this film is the last.

See the first one.",6,19 October 2016,"Mysteries abound on our planet. Why did Homo sapiens prevail over Homo neanderthalensis? Who will decode the Zodiac letters? Why is Kate McKinnon such total comedic catnip? And now, thanks to Tom Cruise, we have another: Why in creation is Jack Reacher: Never Go Back showing in IMAX?To actually shoot a film in IMAX isn't just some eh-why-not decision -- it requires bulky and expensive cameras, it costs a lot of money, and there aren't a whole lot of screens around to show it. This is why hardly anyone does it. (Christopher Nolan used it in Interstellar, and The Dark Knight Rises also had a few flagship scenes; JJ Abrams and Zack Snyder have dabbled as well. Clint Eastwood's Sully is notable for being arguably the first major motion picture shot almost entirely on IMAX cameras.)But there are also IMAX pretenders, shot on regular film but projected onto the giant screen regardless. Star Wars Episode III is one. Having just watched the advance screening of Cruise's Jack Reacher sequel in IMAX, it sure looks to be another.And this is strange, because Jack Reacher is about the last film I'd expect to merit the ten-story treatment. It has no special effects to speak of; no sweeping expanses or shiny alien worlds or majestic spaceflight or men in capes swinging from rooftops.The original didn't, either. I liked the original Jack Reacher film, the way I might like finding a classic boombox at a garage sale or dropping an LS1 into a V70. Underpromoted and under-appreciated, it was a tidy, gritty, old fashioned and workmanlike little picture that punched considerably above its weight, a solid genre piece in a hard-nosed genre we don't see much of anymore.This sequel, though, falls short.Cruise reprises his role as reserved tough-guy Reacher, a modern-day drifter with a military police resume, savage street-fighting take-downs, and a deep respect for the uniform. His itinerant existence is getting over the top here -- he's traded the 1970 Chevelle of last time for hitchhiking around with only the clothes on his back and thirty bucks in his pocket -- but he's still, somehow, not only surviving but helping MPs solve unspecified crimes on federal land (?). He takes a shine to Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) based solely on her comely phone voice (...) and buys a bus ticket to DC to take her out to dinner (not weird at all). He arrives to find that she's been stripped of her command and tossed in the brig, and a mystery is brewing -- involving arms in Afghanistan, Blackwater-esque security firms, government intrigue, and a possible teenage daughter Reacher never knew he had (Danika Yarosh). Reacher sets out to get to the bottom of all this, thus beginning a -- well, the kind of movie your dad would watch, and probably will.The lion's share of the film involves Reacher, Turner, and the maybe-daughter fighting with people, running from people, or hiding out in hotels. Director Edward Zwick makes much of every drawn out foot chase, fistfight, and taunting phone call from the villain -- who, surprise of surprises, is a nonspecific stubble-faced ex-special forces crony who lacks even so much as a name.Strip away the seventies-style action (they're coming, run!) and the one-beat plot, and you're left with Reacher being an off-grid know-it-all hard-butt, and Cobie doing her level best to inject some modernity into the exercise. (She has a brief scene where she complains about having fought sexism her entire career -- but that message didn't seem to reach the writers, who in the end still relegated her safely to a back up role.) The maybe-daughter looks something like Anna Paquin and is mildly petulant but never really sympathetic, and so there's not much for Reacher to do but deliver brutal and unrealistic one-hit take-downs to a series of ""ex-military"" thugs he finds in various spots (chiefly downtown DC and New Orleans -- hardly the most inspiring global locations.)Abundant cell phones aside, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back belongs in another era. It plays like a flip-book of filmgoing memories, the kind of film where characters slink away unnoticed from a shooting scene, disappearing into a crowd; where the good guys spend the whole movie running from the law but all is forgiven as soon as the real bad guy is revealed. A lot of this strains believability, especially today. I mean, Reacher can savagely beat two men in a crowded plane without raising any suspicion whatsoever? Come on -- once the cabin door closes you can't even play Words With Friends without being tossed onto the tarmac and probably tazed.But perhaps that's the appeal. In a world of senseless death and ""active shooters"" -- a world where Baltimore street criminals routinely pump dozens of rounds into each and every victim -- it's sad to say it's refreshing to watch grizzled, macho war machines pound one other in the face for good, honest, salute-the-flag reasons. If only that were our world -- and if only Never Go Back did it quite so well as the original.Haus Verdict: In search of an old-fashioned, low-tech little potboiler that'll make you long for the time when fists were enough?

280,rwolfe-51222,Just awful,1,27 October 2016,Lee Child always made sure the reader understood the size of Jack Reacher as an introduction to almost every fight. In this movie everybody is larger than Tom Cruise. In one fight scene he gets tossed about by one guy who isn't very big. In the first movie you could overlook the fact that Tom Cruise is not even 6 feet tall but not so in this movie.If you've read this book then you'll be so disappointed in this movie. In the book the part of Reacher's supposed daughter and her mother are both likable characters. In the movie she's a juvenile delinquent and almost immediately unlikable.Lee Child wrote Reacher as an intelligent man reasoning through the situations he found himself. You could see that in the first movie. In this movie we don't get a chance to see that intelligence. Lee Child wrote the Susan Turner character as a smart woman but that doesn't come through either. It isn't always about the action. It's also about him being intelligent and solving the problem.I walked out on this movie in under 30 minutes. The first Reacher movie allowed Reacher fans to accept the tiny Tom Cruise as Reacher. This movie makes it impossible to take that leap. Reacher always seemed to me to making his way toward something as he worked through the problems he found himself overcoming. I admit to not seeing this film through to the end but it seemed to me that in this film he was running from the bad guys. The Reacher I know always plays offense.Save yourself the disappointment. Watch the first Reacher movie again or read the book again. Either would be more pleasing to Reacher fans than watching this garbage. Tom Cruise is a good action star but the writing and direction are so bad in this movie that you just can't overlook tiny Tom Cruise being huge Jack Reacher.,Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

284,admtech69,Not an improvement over the original,6,27 October 2016,"While the trailer gives too many of the best scenes away (as do seemingly most Hollywood trailers of late), the second entry in the Jack Reacher franchise fails in it's attempt to capitalize on the momentum of the original. With the titular character ably portrayed by Tom Cruise as the quintessential and confident bad-ass, the surrounding cast and paint-by-numbers story-line struggle around his nucleus to present a believable and involving action flick.One of the issues that plagues the franchise is that the source material portrays Reacher as 6'5"" tall at a beefy 250 lbs, capable of taking on 4-5 attackers at a time. Cruise is in great shape and appears at least 10 years younger than his actual age but even with strategic camera angles, at 5'7"", it is fairly obvious that he is physically outmatched when surrounded by 4 of his assailants. Yet much ass is kicked with relative ease. This affects the realism meter as the film progresses.Another issue is the somewhat stilted dialogue and a few ""Oh, come on, that would never happen!"" moments that elicited a few unintended laughs from other audience members during the viewing I attended.The supporting cast do their part in workman-like fashion and some of the dialogue between Cruise's Reacher and Co-star Cobie Smulders' Turner entertains and engages as they argue while being simultaneously attracted to one another. Rounding out the cast as the chief antagonist, Patrick Heusinger is an effective (if somewhat clichéd) ex- Special Forces Psychopath who hunts Reacher throughout the film.It's unclear at this point whether there will be a third film instalment but based on early box office returns, a sequel is likely. I hope they can take the best elements from the first film which had better fight scenes, less stilted dialogue and fewer formulaic plot devices. Seeing as the Jack Reacher Book series is currently at 21 novels, there should be a worthy successor in the Lee Child-penned Canon to put the film franchise back in good stead the next time around. If you are looking for a breezy action flick with low expectations regarding plot twists or realism, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back fits the bill.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The last action scene I thought was a bit too long and a bit cliché, but other than that was so much fun.

From start I didn't expect too much from Jack Reacher 2 but after having watched it I felt like it wasn't worth the 2 hours cinema experience. The Film begins with a story which for me isn't the most interesting and then takes an air of ""Taken"" with Tom Cruise playing the father who wants to protect his ""fictional daughter"" from being kidnapped. There are also some moments remembering me the opening action sequence of ""James Bond Spectre"". In total the plot is not interesting enough and you assist in the end to an action packed commercial movie. The movies had also something ""too americanized"" feeling to it which in my humble opinion was negative for the viewers experience...

While the first movie followed the book to some degree. If you read the book and then watch the movie you would not believe it was the same story other than the names of the characters. The Reacher movies in general miss it completely as casting Tom Cruise as Reacher is a huge miss. Lee Child in every book describes Reacher as a blonde guy well over 6 feet and 250 pounds, not Cruise so again if you read the books it is hard to picture Cruise as Reacher. One of the characters in the movie was Sam a young girl. In the movie she was a main character in the book she was more minor.

I had no problem with T.Cruise being Reacher, but I hated how he acted and spoke, for me it was kind of strange and ridiculous. I suppose that must have been some American thing I cannot grasp. :) And I hated R. Pike looking dumb with big eyes all the time, and I disliked Jay Courtney's character and acting as well.But with this I had no problem, Cruise became a better Reacher, both ladies were interesting characters and good actors, and there was action enough.

It's like they tried to change a great recipe.Jack Reacher was a bad guy with no sentiment at all and comes back as a good guy who is in love with a woman, who wants to be a father and who even gets bitten up from time to time.In my opinion a very good movie who should not be named Jack Reacher 2.

The only man or actor that could have ever lived up to the depiction physically and had the presence and quality described in the books was John Wayne in the fifties, incidentally, a far more limited actor than Cruise but also a man that always consistently delivered an entertaining movie.

295,jambawala,B-grade sequel to an A-grade movie,3,5 February 2017,"Wow - talk about underwhelming. The first Jack Reacher film was one of the most intelligent action-thrillers in a long time. This was largely because of the A-list talent supporting Tom Cruise like writer- director Christopher McQuarrie, and actors like Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins and David Oyelowo. Even Jai Courtney did his part well and the addition of Werner Herzog was inspired. The opening scene of the first movie was near magical.Now we come to Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, the pathetic sequel. You don't need to watch the movie to know it's pathetic - just take a look at the folks around Tom Cruise this time. The director now is Ed Zwick - not terrible, he did make The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond which were good for what they were: socio-politically charged action films. But Zwick can't do much in the Reacher territory. He tries to half-heartedly bring in a larger, systemic problem to the fray as he has done before but he hopelessly flounders. Acting alongside Cruise this time are b-list actors like Cobie Smulders, Robert Knepper (the annoying, one-note, racist from Prison break) and an annoying 15- year old girl who looks 20.Think about that for a second - from Werner Herzog, we moved to Robert Knepper. That's how bad this sequel is. It's an affront to the Jack Reacher brand created by the first film. There is no compelling mystery in the film, I'm not even entirely sure if I remember the insipid plot all that much. Calling it forgettable would be a kindness.Look - if you really have nothing better to watch on a night you're staying in, then put this on. You're not going to remember it later and it may even annoy you because of how bad it is compared to the first film - but there's a reason I'm rating it 3 stars and not 1.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

I never saw the first movie and had never read Lee Child's series. I am not an action flick fan, but I like a good detective plot. I am not fond of Tom Cruise, but I don't mind him if the story and the characters are interesting. I liked the character he played here, although it is his sidekick Susan Turner that really drew my attention. Cobie Smulders made Major Turner very credible. She is strong and cold-blooded, yet noble and principled. I liked her enough to want to read the novel, which I did afterwards. That was a disappointment. The movie script took the best elements of the book and made it concise and effective, letting go of some unnecessary detours and confrontations. The characters are better developed over all. The relationship between Reacher and Turner is mostly platonic in the film adaptation, which I like. There is a work partner dynamic between them and sometimes, inevitable tension. I was not expecting them to sleep together and to get along so well in the book. Reacher's possible daughter Samantha Dayton has an important role in the film, but only appears for a short while in the book. I believe it was a wise choice to give her a bigger role as Reacher, Turner and Sam make an interesting trio. Not the best film I've seen, and you need to have some basic information about Jack Reacher to know what this story is about at first, but I enjoyed it.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Anyway, the rest is a good movie, and the characters and plot follow the 1st one well. I gave it an 8, not a ten, because the scene I stated pushes the rest of the story-arc (i.e., why they have to run while the rest of the movie occurs).

The co-star is eye candy and can't do it all on her own 3. The side story does everything she can... everything you expect and predict she will do to get everyone killed. 4. In the end, the protagonist has to face off single-handedly against the bad guy, even though the co-star is just above them with a weaponThe last half hour of this movie could have been left out and a disclaimer put on the screen saying ""You already know how this is going to end, so we won't bother"". How many times did the stars walk around weapons they could have picked up and used? Case in point, when the costar choked out the bad guy with a garden hose, she ran right past him and didn't grab his gun. For that matter, why were these two not carrying the whole time?How many times did the costar try to hammer someone on the head with the bottom of her fist, only to get thrown across the room? Why did it take forever for the costar to make it to help the star at the end when she was just above where he fell with a handgun right there?I'm just glad I didn't go to the theater to see this film.

I love HIMYM and I never analyzed Cobie Smulders in it, because it is just a sitcom and you don't really need to know to act to be good in it. But in this movie I noticed she is probably the worst actor I have ever seen in a blockbuster. She was still Robin from HIMYM, her role and everything was so unbelievable, I didn't know if its a SNL parody or a real movie. She must be good in bed, otherwise she would never make the transition from sitcom to real cinema. Other than that, the movie was very simple, predictable and with no interesting parts.

A cool plot that kept you on the edge of your seat combined with good dialogue and character growth. This film completely makes the 'franchise' take a big step back, so would be enough for Tom Cruise and his wallet to 'never go back'. If the word predictable applied to any film, i'm sure Film Schools would use this as an example. I sat watching, predicting the next line. You can tell when things come up that they're be relevant later, it's so in your face. The characters have no appeal, the direction is bland, Cruise becomes boring and the film doesn't feel like the first at all. I would put it in the same category as the Mummy- uses the star power to sell tickets and cuts over script and any real thrill. If you want a good action movie with a thrilling plot, maybe look at a proper franchise like Taken, Die Hard, and not an attempt to keep Tom Cruise relevant outside of another action franchise on its last legs. 6/10",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
325,flaviu-11839,Why so angry reviews?,8,17 January 2017,"I'm a huge Reacher/Lee Child fan, and I enjoyed a lot the first installment with Tom Cruise. I read some other reviews for ""Never Go Back"", with some quite angry viewers claiming their ticket money back, annoyed about ""lack of explosions"", ""dull"" female- lead character, and so on. I read many Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, including the one that INSPIRED (as noted in the opening credits) this movie. Yes, generally, Jack Reacher is a loner, an ex-MP guy with whom you don't want to mess too much. But, come on, the action is quite OK, the spirit of the book is there, the general action and suspense from the novel are present. I agree that there may exist some powerful sequels to the first movie (The Bourne series, for example), but there are also some lower ones (the James Bond movies after Casino Royale). So, let's wait. Tom Cruise miscast as Reacher? Why? Only because he's not physically like the character Lee Child imagined? The acting and directing matter more, I think. Acting? Very good, from Tom's part, at 54 climbing the roofs and being the center of the action. A stronger Turner character might've been a better choice but, we will see how it develops in movie #3 (if...). Directing? Not as fast-paced as #1. And the spirit of the Jack Reacher books deserve more. Maybe, the miscast is there. Still, 8 from me.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The erstwhile King of Hollywood punches various villains lights out in style in this funny and thrilling crime yarn.As well as the usual amazing stunts and beautifully choreographed bashings that you would expect from a Jack Reacher sequel, this moving contains more emotional depth than the previous installment, with Cobie Smulders also excellent as a military babe with attitude whose unarmed combat skills are not to be sneezed at.

328,lukeyh,Worst Tom Cruise movie since 'Days of Thunder',1,12 March 2017,"This is simply the worst Tom Cruise movie since the days of ""I know Cole he always goes to the outside"" and with an even lamer plot device.Tom is such a mystery to me, some of his films are absolutely brilliant. Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, Edge of Tomorrow, a Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, Rain Man. Several of which would feature in my personal top-20 films of all time.Some of them are alright, Mission Impossible and Top Gun for example, not great but good solid popcorn films.And some are absolutely terrible; such as the rest of the Mission Impossible franchise, Far and Away, the aforementioned Days of Thunder.I'm wondering if the more creative control Mr Cruise has the worse the film (see: George Lucas). When he has clear direction, 'stand there, look good, say this line this way' he is brilliant. And in all fairness he is a terrific actor if, perhaps, a deeply flawed producer and writer. I would avoid this film at all costs. The plot is silly and the script is terrible. The action sequences are even more ridiculous, several thugs standing in a circle around Cruise, waiting for their turn to hit or be hit, none of them pulling out their guns and simply shooting him.Young actress Danika Yarosh is excellent and is star material.The rest of the cast is poorly cast and struggle to make a terrible script believable.

Reminds me of the heavy handed ""Tempus Fugit"" explanation remark from Tomb Raider.Also why is it that whenever someone who knows no Martial Arts gets taught a single move it's always used to help get the bad guy at the end, and what a one dimensional Bad Guy, I don't blame the actor but the writers of this film, it had no twists at all. They must have been told to give the plot a single sentence summary and that's what the script was made from.Almost as bad as a street smart girl using a stolen credit card to buy some room service, come on, really?The Top Bad guy was woefully underused and not very scary at all. I also predicted a bad officer turning back to good, though I chose the wrong one.Again it's an action film, where it's one fight scene linked to another by a few lines of dialogue, like so many made recently.

The only thing that is correct about this movie is the name, apparently, they never went back to do anything, which they should for about 90% of the film, from early draft script to one take of bad acting, you can pick.Let's start with the script, I have seen deeper ones in porn and better face expressions in soup operas. The plot made no sense with so many plot holes you could make a Swiss cheese factory work for a month.The pace was so fast and with so many ""does ex Machina""s that even a toddler will lift an eyebrow.The only thing that was OK was the action parts, but they choose to make the sound of each hitting fist like the guys were hitting the microphone directly instead of each other, my ears were not pleased...Do you yourself a favor, do something else then watch this piece of s**t.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

It kinda was. Of course, it's utter tosh - but so is any action movie if you want to be picky. I found that I had less patience with some of the obvious goofs (such as a professional killer not being able to notice Reacher approaching his car, even though he is plainly looking straight at him AND is supposed to be staking the guy out; and a credit card not having been 'blocked' by its well-heeled card holder, several days after it has been stolen inside a handbag) than with how authentic and believable it was as a whole.Did the movie leave me wishing that I could have the last two hours of my life back?

If you're like me who ha read the books and was excited to see how and what crime(s) Jack Reacher might solve like the first movie- you might as well watch the first one again. I was disappointed to see little investigation, no real reason as to why, who or what commuted what and why. The first movie was amazing with how he solved the big mystery with action at the end. Yeah,you might as well go home, buy some wine or beer with the $10 you saved and throw in a slightly better than average movie, because that's exactly what this is. Rent it at redbox or watch it on Netflix- don't waste your money. On an interesting side note: the author of the books was in the movie - for about 3 seconds but he was in it.

337,YourTearingMeApart,Horrible,2,14 November 2016,"I kind of liked the first Jack Reacher movie. It had a solid story and Tom Cruise played the Reacher character with enough quirks to keep me interested. This new movie is so preposterous I wanted to slap my face near a dozen times. You pretty much know how it starts out if you've seen the movie trailer which was everywhere to an obnoxious level ""That phones going to ring and your going to be wearing these cuffs.. blah blah blah"". They should have started with a little more action IMO. Apparently Jack Reacher is like a homeless stalker who is constantly calling Cobie Smulders character, Turner, and flirting with her via pay phones. He finally makes it to DC (hitchhiking) and finds out she's been arrested for espionage. Holt McCallany (wasted in this move) also informs Reacher that he has a kid(?) and he's a deadbeat dad. So now we have this kid involved played by Danika Yerosha with WAY to much hair. Soon Cruise is arrested, break him and Turner out of prison and they're running around DC like they're Jason Bourne. I've been to DC, you don't f!ck around in DC like this! They are set up and implicated in so many assaults and deaths they would be shot on sight in most countries. So it seems a little strange when Cruise is knocking people out on plan flights and leaving them in the bathroom? I think they check those before landing? And I don't think you can RUN outside airports on the tarmac in ANY major airport in the US and I'm positive you can't do it in New Orleans. And you know what else you can't do in New Orleans? Find anyone on Bourbon Street during Halloween (and sorry but they don't do parades down Bourbon Street). If your separated your done, just go get a Hurricane and chill. And this isn't the OLD WEST, if you've been implicated in murders and assaults it doesn't matter if one guys believes you, your still going to jail (or shot on sight). Now I'm not a Tom Cruise hatter. There are a bunch of Cruise movies I love. But he's starting to look his age. He's in great shape for 54 but he's never playing a 54 year old dude in any of his movies. Keep your shirt on bro (comes off twice). His acting is like he's trying to act like he has no emotion and it is uncomfortable. Anti-acting? Finally at the end of the movie he does his red face-red eyes-I'm full of emotion-look. He can get you right in the feels with that. I'm positive there are better Lee Child books Tom could have picked from? Maybe one without an annoying daughter side story and more believable sequences (I'd say action but.. not so much)? Or stick to the Mission Impossible flicks. I give this a 2. If you like brainless action you might like this. or just watch the first one again and enjoy you some Werner Herzog! _ Stay Sick!!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
338,jasperbos,"A very good movie, but not for the action fanatics",9,29 December 2017,"After the original I expected this one to be good, and indeed it was good. In my opinion it's even better as the first one. I don't get most of the low ratings/bad reviews about this movie, however some I sort of understand:Yes, there is less action then expected. But I think this is a good instead of a bad thing. If you watch this movie for the action alone I get why you're disappointed. If you are watching this movie as a movie and not only for the action, then I think this is your movie. The story of the movie is good and gets you really into watching the whole movie. However I agree with some of the reviews that mentioned the 'bad side/bad guys' stayed somewhat dull. In general I think that if they added a few more minutes to the movie to deepen the bad guy story, to add a little bit more action and to (sort of) slow down some of the scenes it would have been a better movie.Conclusion: I stay with my opionion that it's a really good movie. For me i think the general rating should lie somewhere beteen the 7 and 8.5 out of ten.
If you are going to watch this movie and expect a whole lot of action scenes and five minutes of story, then be prepared to be disappointed. If you are going to watch this movie and are willing to compromise a little on the action scenes....then yes... go watch the movie.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

340,madegta,"Slowly builds up to a great movie, but doesn't rise over the first of the series.",7,20 October 2016,"While I enjoyed most of 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' as a sequel to a very thrilling, action film 'Jack Reacher', there were parts that I didn't enjoy, mainly in the second act of the film.The film starts off with Jack sitting in a restaurant, after just finishing off four guys in a fight outside. The police officers approach him and proceed to arrest him. Jack then tells the officers that a phone will ring, and that the cops will be coming to arrest the police officer that has just arrested Jack, and so that is what happens. While this was a funny scene to watch, I couldn't shake off the fact of how Jack knew about all of this, without explaining to us (the audience) how. Though, later through this scene, we do find out that Jack had been planning this with someone else and everything was explained. My problem with this though is that, while everything was explained later in the scene, the same trend carried on throughout the second act of the film, although a lot of things were left unexplained.During the second act, Jack has already encountered his thought-to-be daughter, Samantha, and has to protect her from an agent trying to kill Jack, and now also Samantha. The main thing that put me off during this act, was all the coincidental perfect timings, and all the odd choices that were made. There were a lot of times in the beginning of the film where I felt that, what they were doing looked a bit odd and maybe forced. There is a scene where Jack and Susan are running from the agent, and they a running for a bus to catch. Just seeing Jack and Susan run through the middle of the streets and into the open grass outside the Whitehouse didn't look all that convincing and ""real"" and seemed very out of place. It was just a strange sight and didn't really work all that well.Later on, Jack and Susan are forced to enter the kitchen area of a restaurant, as the agent has blocked any other way of escaping. There is a fight scene in the kitchen, but just before the fight starts, Jack is hiding behind a pantry, while the agent is lurking through the kitchen. I just couldn't help but be a little bit angry at how the agent could not see Jack. There was close to nothing on the pantry, so it wasn't like Jack had a lot of cover, yet the agent could not see him, even when he looked directly in Jack's direction.There was also a scene where Jack and Susan had to escape the prison. They leave in the back of a food truck, of which the police follow and stop in the middle of the street. The food truck is surrounded by the police, all aiming at the truck, no one taking their eyes off of it. Then all of a sudden, a police car races off from the back, with Jack and Susan driving. There was no possible way they could've gotten out of that truck and into the car without a police officer seeing. This brings me back to the un-explained sequences of this film. There is a scene where Jack and Susan enter someone's house to get a hold of some files. Although, the man's house they enter, is the man they are trying to stay away from. Once they get what they need, we cut to the next scene, and no explanation is shown to how they got out of there, while making sure the ""bad guy"" wasn't trying to follow them. The scene was too big and had too much going on to just cut away from. It just seemed to simple and easy and felt like a cheap way out.Although, while through the first and second act, I was thinking of rating this movie a 5/10, I changed my mind to a 7 once I saw the third and final act. The final action scene of which the second act had been leading up to, was flawless. The tension definitely built up during this act, as the agent had now threatened to kill Samantha, as well as Jack. Jack goes through a great deal of fighting through groups of enemies, on his way to encountering the agent, of whom is now holding Samantha over the edge of a building. Jack shows how much he cares for Samantha, as he throws himself into the agent, and off the building, onto the ground below. They go through a slightly awkward, yet ""on-the-edge-of-your-seat"" fight to the death. Jack ends the fight with doing what he said earlier on the phone, that he would break the agents arms, then his legs, then his neck, and concludes the fight with throwing him off the ledge. Yet, this was a very similar ending to the first film, as Jack said almost the same thing, and did the same thing to his enemy then.So, while the film started out a little strange and off-putting, it all un-raveled into a great finale. The film is a good sequel, yet doesn't quite live up to the thrill-ride of its predecessor, 'Jack Reacher'. I feel that this film followed a bad trend that is rising in action movie sequels, where the main character is attempted to be given a much deeper persona, while also trying to be the same person from the first film, yet it comes out in a very odd, strange blend of who we knew from the first film, and who this new identification is. It was troubling to have to accept this new introduction to the main character, when we have already been identified with him from the first film.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Tom Cruise wasn't bad, but he is almost always at least alright, and I enjoyed the movies opening scene in the bar with Tom Cruise and the two sheriffs.However, I didn't like the girl that they carry around who is supposedly the daughter of Jack Reacher( She isn't). She often put the other two in danger by doing stuff she wasn't supposed to be doing, Such as using a mobile phone that she wasn't supposed to be using and using a phone in a hotel to order room service after clearly being instructed that she shoudn't use otherwise she would be found. I sometimes also found the story confusing, and I'm also starting to sick of seeing faceless villains just getting picked off again and again and again.Overall, if you're tired and want to watch an OK action movie, you might want to see this movie but from apart from that I wouldn't really recommend this because better action movies get released regularly.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The acting was awful, Tom didn't even seem to care about the film because even his acting was bad. There are a few plots that are rushed and pointless. It feels like a quick movie they pumped out and make money. It felt low budget and poorly directed. Parts of it didn't make sense and scenes didn't follow well.

348,lostcanadian-87062,Dismal,3,23 January 2017,"First I would like to say I am both an avid reader of Lee Child's novels and a watcher of Tom Cruise's movies. In fact I have all of Mr. Child's books and most of Tom Cruise's films. But a major mistake was made here. Mr. Child is not Fyodor Dostoevsky, Charles Dickens or even John Steinbeck. People read his stories because of and only because of, the protagonist, Jack (no middle name) Reacher. The plot is superfluous, the story line is incidental and quite often inane like the lives most of us are living. We read them because we dream about being Reacher, a 6'5"", 250 pound hulk with hands the size of frozen turkeys who wanders around America owning nothing and wanting nothing other than to right wrongs. Mr. Child is good at character development and his fans are intimately aware of Reacher's answer to most problems. He hits them, hard, once. And we love the vicarious thrills it brings.But then someone noticed the popularity of the books and Tom Cruise bought the movie rights thinking the stories would be a great vehicle for his 5'7"" pretty boy physique. Wrong! I watched the movie and looked for Reacher. He wasn't in the movie so I tried to get immersed in the story line but it was shallow and inconsequential like most of Mr. Child's books. That doesn't matter, we read them because we want to read about Reacher not to be enthralled by the prose. It failed on both Reacher and the story. I am waiting for someone to cast the right person as Reacher. My vote is for Dave Bautista or Dwayne Johnson. He doesn't have to be an Oscar winning actor he just has to put one foot in front of the other, figure out what's wrong and hit the bad things.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

The only thing that even tells you it was based on a great book was the names of the characters and the base story. If you read the book and are a fan DO NOT watch this movie. It will make you sad. My prejudice aside against the hack of an actor Cruise, the way the twist the book to hardly resemble it at all is just bad form. I am disappointed in Lee Child for letting this happen. I had to give it a chance since I love the books, but at this point I might have to give the books up just because. If seems all Lee cares about is the money now.

The best person in it is Tea-Bag from Prison Break and he's criminally under used. The villains are straight out of central casting, it's just bad bad baaaaaaad.Some of the action sequences are well choreographed, but you have to sit through so much twaddle you just don't care.Donate your money to charity instead, it's a shame the production team didn't do the same with their budget.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

For example: They go to some internet cafe trying to log in some military db, over, and over, and over, with the same username and password giving bad guys enough time to find them. Seriously? You escape military prison and then try to log into db with YOUR username and password??? Acting. Terrible. Worst acting in high budget movie I've ever seen. Why does everybody have their faces like they have eaten something bad? Looking angry (looks more like they really have to go to the bathroom) all the time does not mean that you are extraordinary tough or smart. Tom did his job bearable but everyone else are just annoying.Visual effects. Bad. Not worst but plain bad. At least for this kind of movie.Action scenes. Extremely bad.

I should have read some of the warnings here ""Never go back"". I love the first movie (watched it again just the day before) and was expecting something similar (judging by the trailer).

The female lead was annoying, I had had enough of that character after the first five minutes and had to put up with her till the end!

Went on the plane with them and much more. It's ""good"" to see Jack thinking about could this actually be his child and how his feelings are moved that if so, he should have been there all these years for her. I would have enjoyed seeing more of the books version. For me, as I had said both good, I would not read a Jack Reacher book that was going to be made into a movie. Hey, who am I?

362,redswin,Typical Brainless Action Flick,4,31 October 2016,"The reason I gave the second Jack Reacher movie a look was due, in part, to the mostly fresh view of a tired and cliché genre. The first movie was smart. We didn't know the answers and were surprised both pleasantly and otherwise during the movie. There were enough sprinkles of humor in the film to break the intensity and draw us into the movie, while identifying with the characters. Yeah, some of the fight scenes were unnecessary, but not overdone (until the end). I was really looking forward to see if they could match the quality in the second film.It wasn't even close.The film reverted back to the tired clichés of unlikely car chases and impossible fight scenes and substituted the intelligence of the first movie for a forced relationship between Jack Reacher and a teenage girl. Oh, and the very unlikely romantic line with Colby Smulders. The story line was entirely predictable and uninspiring. The tag line should just have said, ""Tom Cruise gets to prove he is excellent at everything - again!""If you are bored and there is nothing else to watch, then this would be an okay option.

Ironically, a big part of the movie's audience must be people who have read and enjoyed the book. They are in for a disappointment.What a world!P.S. IMDb is insisting my review cannot be a review unless it's at least 10 lines long. They threaten dire penalties if I cannot meet this goal. I was only able to watch about 10 minutes of the movie. Any more than that would have given me an ulcer. Even in that brief time, I could have thought of dozens of reasons why the movie was awful.However, I think I would rather just try to forget that I ever saw it. Nothing against Cruise, for those who may be on one side or the other. I disapprove of the casting choice, but that's not enough to ruin the movie for me. The problem is that they took an interesting story, with interesting characters, and turned it into a boring and stupid cartoon.Actually, most cartoons are better than this, so I really have nothing to compare it to that would help the potential viewer to understand how bad the movie is.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

I voted ""9"" because so many scenes were gifts to the audience. They weren't vanities for the film-maker. They must know we're busy and life is crowded, so these folks waded in and told us a story. The cut corners on time and once or twice, even cut corners on logic, because it's a story, not an affidavit. I compare this film to a violent Moody Blues album from the higher consciousness days. ""Desolation! Creation! Illusion! Compassion! . . ."" These folks notice that ""It's urgent that our expensive art form should make maximum use of this short life time, these opportunities, these talents and equipment."" The story illustrated a real-life danger of big organizations. It was violent because unfortunately that story needs to be told too. The characters were so real that it worried me and sent me into thinking about focusing more, which rarely happens in a film. The characters didn't fall off the turnip truck and try to con us. And unlike this review, the film didn't include a scene that wasn't squeezed into sacredness with the care it was given. A lot of good movies are being made these days.

It baffles me how the part of a 6'5"" man mountain has gone to Cruise who is a virtual dwarf by comparison, at best mediocre actor and all around creepy guy. The movie itself is your standard Hollywood action flick, i.e middle of the road and nowhere near as good as the book. The only positive is the addition of the delightful Miss Smulders who as well as having been excellent in How I Met Your Mother is ridiculously attractive and somehow manages to still be so as a buff, hard army officer.

The startling lack of chemistry between him and that Robin girl is hokey enough but that wretched character of daughter-not daughter brat is enough to make one want to lose their lunch.

373,ayushtavar,"An excellent, fast paced thriller",9,22 October 2016,"I seriously don't understand why this movie is getting such bad reviews. If you're a die hard Jack Reacher fan then you're gonna love this movie. If you're a fan of action movies in general then you'll certainly like it. It's got all the right things in place. Great action, solid performances, a decent soundtrack and a shitload of ass-kicking the Reacher way. Seriously this movie is pretty damn good.It is quite different from the first one too. The first one was a quiet and slow thriller. This one's completely opposite. Which isn't a bad thing. It's always throwing something at you, both good and bad, necessary and unnecessary. It's loud and brutal and wants to be heard and demands your attention but doesn't really reward you for it.The performances are great. Cruise is Cruise and is as great as ever. His height didn't bother me at all and his solid and brutal performance more than made up for it. Coincidentally he and Reacher turned 54 this year. It was always great to see him on screen and especially great to watch him kick some ass. But the highlight here was Cobie Smulders. She absolutely stole the show and left me quite impressed. She was as good as last year's Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust in Mission Impossible Rogue Nation.The villain was a little flat. He was intimidating at times but overall the whole villain factor in the movie wasn't all that great. The rest of the cast worked with what they had and the chemistry between them felt a little sloppy at times and even forced. But its not a perfect movie. No way. Its got it's share of flaws.The most notable one would be the change in the director. Edward Zwick does his best to fill the gap Christopher McQuarrie left but fails to do so. The movie would have been a lot better with McQuarrie on board. The story was weak and incoherent at times. The villains lacked motive and there were plenty of things that were left unexplained at the end.Overall I'd say that if you stop nitpicking, you're going to find a fun and thrilling movie which is worth every buck.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

376,piotr_malarz,could have been better,5,7 January 2017,"I am a big fan of the Jack Reacher book series. I was really exited to find out that movie was to be released based on book.Attention Spoilers!The first movie was not bad. I liked it. I was not quite fond of Tom Cruise playing a main role - beaning a bit shorter than described in book and a little less muscular. However first movie was good it was keeping me entertained.Than second one came out and I was excited to see it. After screening it left me so disappointed. The action scenes were good. However the plot not quite matching with original. I can understand that as the movie is ""based"" on book. What you see on screen is a bit silly - especially scenes where main characters are running. Looks like they a bit disorganized and just doing this cause they got military background. Also the actual events from book are scattered over the movie in no order. There is also no visible connection between the two main characters - something it was evident in book. Bringing alleged daughter of Reacher was done in very messy way. The other thing that bugs me is the villains. Beaning military trained they not making any effort to fight back. Apart from one main bad ass - which was actually not described like that in book. I know today Hollywood wants more actions,explosions and all the ""drama"" that they can squeeze, but there are certain limits. The original book was much better. It kept a reader on it's toes right to the end. Movie however was a mediocre if not forgettable. I think this is part of Tom Cruise being involved in production and his influence is visible from movies like Mission Impossible. Don't get me wrong he is a good, dedicated actor, but the second installment of Jack Reacher franchise was beyond his talent. Or maybe he was trying too much. If there will be a third movie based on book i would like it to be a bit more true to it, instead of being processed for a dumber audience. Or perhaps it needs a new actor for main role. Overall I give it 5 stars as it was not complete garbage.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

He's not poncing around and shows the grit that we have come to enjoy from Jack Reacher. The film left me very confused as their was so much missing compared to the book.

What killed it in my opinion is the scene in the hotel where Tom Cruise asks his strong independent female co-star to look after his daughter while he goes out and does stuff. Strong independent woman then throws a hissy fit and begins complaining like a stereotypical woman. How dare Tom Cruise assume she would have maternal instinct?! How dare he treat her like a woman and not like a dude?! Doesn't Tom Cruise know that she is a strong wamhan! Waaahhh! Most people would have switched off at that point, I certainly did.

Boy, was I disappointed; Tom Cruise, one of my favourite stars, doesn't deliver a line with conviction. The Botox effect quite obvious on his face, he is unable to do anything except speak and blink. Cobie Smulders, no doubt a stunner, compensates for lack of Cruise's acting prowess by a double strong dose of overacting. I do not have any words for the kid, Danika Yarosh, she's in a different zone throughout the movie.Lastly, randomly thrown few seconds of action scenes in a movie built on strong character that was introduced in the first 'Jack Reacher' movie.I haven't been this bored and indifferent in any action movie ever.Was a bummer!",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

Cruise is a movie star like no other, still has ""screen glue"" (has charisma and keeps you watching him). I liked the female major character, not too clichéd ( did not care for the mandatory side commentary message on sexual orientation in the military, but let that go).Here is what I liked the most (mild spoiler, but not really...): Absolutely no romantic entanglement or on-screen intimacy.

You can clearly see that seasoned actor and actress were struggling with the script, dialogue and overall plot.Hopefully Tom Cruise can actually start reading his scripts before signing onto films instead of basing it on his fame, advice of others, and marketing to see the success of the films.

Jack Reacher Never Go Back on the other hand feels more like a long and drawn out movie, kind of like a bait and switch with a pointless love interest that never really goes anywhere nor gets solved, it's just a giant loose end. They also try and throw in a long lost daughter but that to falls flat it just feels like it was shoehorned in at the last minute for some extra filler. The movie almost feels as a pointless sequel especially considering how well the first one went. That's not to say it's a terrible movie there's some good action here and there: with Reacher beating up on groups of multiple guys, great car chases, and explosions but that's just about it. The trailer for the movie basically shows you all of the good parts so you're not missing out on much. The movie also feels awkward at times with the amount of close ups the director put into it. It's almost laughable at times and it's not needed, he went overboard with it. There's 9 books in the Jack Reacher series, but hopefully they put the movie series to an early rest and never touch it again.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
392,afahad-17603,Excellent movie with a strong message,10,4 November 2016,"Guys, don't look at the rating, go enjoy this movie, it's totally full of action and a strong message. I enjoyed the movie from the beginning to end. There is a strong message in the movie that goes against the corruption in US ARMY and overall war in Afghanistan and most probably that is why, some so called patriotic are rating this movie low. But, this is an excellent story that does highlight some never known truth or at least it tries to. This message is good for all want to be proud Army and Marine. Beside the message, there is enough action and suspense to keep you totally in the movie. Acting was wonderful as well, specially Tom cruise and the villain. I would buy the DVD because of 1. the action and for the 2. Truth the movie tried to portray.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
393,andrewbattistella,Excellent Excellent Excellent,10,22 February 2017,Excellent sequel to follow up the original. Storyline is good. Acting is good. Action is brilliant.Highly recommend and strongly looking forward to the third installment. Wonderful script writing in showing a softer side to Jack while still being able to maintain his intensity. Tom Cruise has always been a great actor and considering he is shorter in stature than the original he makes up for any shortcomings.,Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
394,johanvan_leeuwen,Jack Reacher Character killed,3,20 January 2017,"Dear Mr. Cruise,As a number 1 fan of the Lee Child novels I will not go into the physical miss-match between you and the character described in the books. I even applaud your performance portraying Jack in the first movie. However I have major issues with this installment. Yes the book is always better and it's very difficult to match and keep a movie enjoyable. The plot and overall story line do follow the book and it makes for an enjoyable movie (Hence a 3, not a 1). However what I really don't like is how Jack is portrayed here. Next to none of his investigative skill nor his wit (lest one scene where Jack is interrogated) or his ability to put down anyone in a hand to hand combat situation, is used here. There is even a person who is probably better at hand to hand combat than him. Only luck made it possible for Jack to win in the end and he certainly did not get out unscathed. In doing this the Jack Reacher character is, in my opinion, killed. I am very disappointed and sincerely hope you and the script writers will do better next time!Best regardsJohan",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
395,xxxbora,Top there of my worsts list,3,21 January 2017,"There is no subject, no integrity... They only make a movie for spend money. What a shame for Tom. I believe don't waste time with that movie. Movie is starting with no understanding, at the moment, there is happening some action but you can only watch actions, impossible you can't understand what happening and why happening than Aka Robin from How I met your mother, she goes prison but again you can't understand and she said, I don't want to see Jack because he try to catch me from prison, keep that mind, they are not met yet :D Than we are learning Jack has a daughter but Jack doesn't not that yet. :D Fellas, please do not watch that movie. Go run, walk or something.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
396,tony-30179,"Cast a ""real"" Jack Reacher",6,20 February 2017,"The movie is pretty decent but....Anyone who has read the books will be in pain the whole time. Reacher is 6'5"" tall, not 5'6"" tall (did they transpose this in casting?). Sorry Tom, you don't cut it. I think the Rock (die his hair blonde) would be perfect for this role. Or a host of other big actors.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
397,mortisha-03050,Done his Dash!!!,3,22 February 2017,"Really, read the books, Jack is one burly man, tall, ex army, huge physique with an attitude... this is not Tom Cruise by any means. How many larger men (bigger than 5'7"" ) and better actors could there be in Hollywood... he is Pathetic, any man who has to stand on a bench to look taller in his movies just doesn't cut it with me. I've read every book and refuse to watch the movies cos he just doesn't match the character. Move him on and get someone who matches the profile. Too old and done his dash...",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
398,blackdogmanguitar,Never should have been made in the first place,1,8 March 2017,"As an avid reader of the books I (like many) was horrified that Tom Cruise was cast in the role of 6'5"" Jack Reacher, but I thought the first film was actually very good and bought into Lee Child's explanation that the descriptions of Reacher were a metaphor and he was a ""force of nature"".This however is a genuinely awful film. Cruise looks old now and is clearly out of shape in this film, which makes him look like a short man with a ""dad bod"" chasing bad guys - utterly implausible - and the only force of nature he could summon up would be a light breeze on a summer's day.I cannot believe that the budget was $60,000,000 - what the hell did they spend it on??? The cinematography is like watching a rerun of a 1970s made for TV film and is screamingly amateurish.Don't waste your time on watching this low budget, generic nonsense.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
399,bourne-04342,Dissatisfied,5,9 July 2017,"Now don't get me wrong, this movie had redeeming value, but it was just missing something the first one had. I am a strong believer that the first movie was much better than what people give it credit for. This one is terrible compared to the first. Tom Cruise gives a Tom Cruise performance, good enough but nothing special. The rest of the cast is not as good. Colbie Smulders is not bad, but her and Cruise have zero chemistry. All the other actors were not good at all. Now the plot was awful. It did not make any sense at all and it did not pull me in. There was no where near as much mystery as there was in the first movie. This one had a boneheaded plot that should have been in a T.V show. Now I will say this movie had OK action and looked fairly good. Other than that, a boring movie pumped iut just to make money.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
400,tchrsub,Tom Cruise was lousy pick for playing Jack Reacher,1,27 August 2017,I wonder if the producers ever looked at Liev Schribar (Ray Donovan) who almost looks like Jack Reacher and is more comparable in physical size than Tom (I'm so short) Cruise. Anybody who has read the Jack Reacher books can picture him as he is described. Jack was a Marine and Cruise is or was nothing.,Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

402,steventorman,Cruise Cameos Boring Female Version of Reacher,4,26 October 2017,"No pressure to be involved in the investigation. You forget they are even investigating a real crime and just watch loosely connected scenes. Character tension is cliché and completely lacking any energy.Female actor does not pull off the ""tough girl, I can be like a man as well"" script - remove her, and the Script can continue with Reacher by himself.Suspected that Lee Child, or at least the Reacher brand in general, has fallen victim to Hollywood female-centric thinking. The reason Reacher was a popular character in the previous movie is because he is an intense man who has had enough, who knows and appreciates cars and guns, and doing the right thing. The crowd that watched the previous film appreciated these values. The audience has been betrayed by subjecting Reacher to a pseudo-paternal role, where the female lead acts as a pseudo-maternal equal. This film is about social and authority control, something the previous audience does not enjoy.No character tensions, no interesting investigation, no plot pressure, and a liberal mood on a franchise that was quite conservative in its values (as opposed to assertions). Like the Terminator franchise, stopping at Terminator 2 saves the franchises reputation. Stopping at the first Jack Reacher will do the same for you as well.Watch it is a freebie if you have too, do not buy (i.e. female lead threatens to attack Jack Reacher, this is a laughable threat given body and muscle mass difference, yet the movie tries to make it a viable reality, as if this is a real possibility).",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
403,johnnydayandtheknights,Why TC ?,9,16 November 2017,"I give this movie, and the previous Jack Reacher movie, a 9. It would have got a 10 if: Jack Reacher, all 6 foot 6 inches, and 250 pounds, were portrayed by an actor at least close to these numbers. But to be played by a 5 foot 7 inch, 150 pound-er (wet), well, that just doesn't fit the bill, for die-hard Jack Reacher fans. Any chance of re-casting the role for future movies?",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
404,amnorfolk,Entertaining if somewhat inaccurate,8,23 October 2016,"I am a fan of the Reacher books and this was a pretty good take on Never Go Back. However, I am a veteran member of the JAG Corps, and the inaccuracies ate at me a bit. From the wrong insignia on the attorneys' uniforms to the jurisdictional errors (the MPs would never make an arrest on civilian property as shown in the beginning, for example), I couldn't help picking them out. I realize these probably wouldn't bother someone with no military experience. Despite the mistakes, however, I enjoyed it. Lots of action and a very high body count. I was glad to see that Reacher and Turner didn't end up in bed; that would have been purely gratuitous and not in keeping with the plot. I was not familiar with the female actors, who did a really good job. I think we'll be seeing a lot more of the teenager.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
405,mr_a_mistry,"Read the book ""never go back""",2,4 September 2018,"I have like millions of Lee Child fans read the Reacher books.
Did anyone of the script writers, casting directors or anyone involved in this movie read the books.
The character of Reacher is very precise.
Tom cruise is an exceptional movie star, but not for this character.
Read the book and then tell me, where this movie relates in anyway to the Reacher character.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back

407,wiekbr,NOT A BOOK!,9,25 May 2019,"People, please stop comparing this movie to the book. I see that with this movie, and even with movies like lotr. I don't think it makes sense, as you need to critique a movie being a movie, not telling that it's a dissapointment ""because the book was better"". Books don't matter when watching a movie.Yeah, the movie is good.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
408,oktobermiller,"Bad Movie, Not Just a Bad Reacher Movie, Just a Bad Movie",1,25 October 2016,"Yes I am a Lee Child/Reacher fan and yes I have read all the books. I am not a nitpicker though. I understand that for editing and thematic purposes a book is butchered from time to time for the sake of creating a script - this movie simply represents a poor job of it.I watched the film last night and woke up with no clear memories about the film so I watched it again to see if I was missing something.From beginning to end too much of the details of the story are tossed out. The film opens up with no explanation of why Reacher is in a diner, where the diner is and how he knows Major Turner. Most of the information is implied by incoherent flashbacks that also don't add any details.I would say incoherent is the operative term throughout. Each scene was like being 35 minutes late t the film and walking in an sitting down and watching it anyways. The minute you figure out what is going on, its already a few scenes later.Reacher was charged with two crimes in the book, and assigned two lawyers. Neither of the crimes was much more than a back story to the main plot, and certainly not the daughter, but these facts are important because it explains why he is operating the way he does. The reason for drafting Reacher back into the Army is not fleshed out and his time confined to the base are completely glossed over. All the military officers in the movie are far too compliant and give up classified and/or privileged information without putting up any kind of fight or demanding a reasonable explanation.Major Turner is scripted as some sort of helpless whiny side kick. There is action, but it doesn't fit in well with the story, it is also incoherent and not well explained and seemed perfunctory as apposed to essential. Again, I saw it last night, and I woke up trying to remember is there was any action, or was it just Reacher on the run with Turner and a teenager? It was like watching a bad Paul Greengrass film minus the shaky camera work. Frenetic, and unconnected. Much like the film Alex Cross had nothing to do with the book I, Alex Cross; Never Go Back has little to do with the Jack Reacher novels.All this would be somewhat acceptable if it were a decent action film, but it is not even that.Therefore I feel I have no choice to but say its just a bad film. Sorry.",Jack Reacher - Never Go Back
