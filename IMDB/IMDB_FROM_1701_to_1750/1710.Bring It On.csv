0,TheLittleSongbird,"Predictable fluff, but bright and energetic fluff all the same",7,19 October 2010,"While Bring it On is not a masterpiece in any shape or form, I have to admit I really enjoyed it. Sure it is fluffy and predictable, with clichéd characters and scenarios, but when you look past the flaws you have a bright and energetic film with a fair amount to redeem it. For instance, it is beautifully filmed, and also has an agreeable soundtrack and sprightly cheer-leading choreography. The dialogue is smart and doesn't feel cringe-worthy or inane, the pacing is snappy and direction is decent. The performances from the cast are very spirited, especially from Kirsten Dunst who is appealing in the lead. In conclusion, not brilliant but energetic and dare I say fun. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Bring It On
1,SnoopyStyle,Fun cheerleader movie,7,19 August 2014,"Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is voted the new captain of the Toro cheerleading squad at San Diego's Rancho Carne High School taking over from Big Red (Lindsay Sloane). After Carver is injured, she picks rebellious gymnast Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku) to replace her. Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford) and Torrance develop chemistry. It should be straight forward to win the national championship for the sixth year in a row with their standard routine. However Torrance discovers that Big Red had actually stolen the choreography from an inner city squad the Clovers led by the Isis (Gabrielle Union).It has the cutesy wacky sensibility of Clueless and the structure of a traditional sports movie. The sport just happens to be cheerleading. It's fun and it's silly. It has its irreverent moments led by a great performance from Kirsten Dunst. At least, there are a few more shades to the traditional dumb mean cheerleader stereotype. The lingo is hilarious. If the viewer is willing to be not so high minded, this cheerleading movie could be a bit of fun.",Bring It On
2,lee_eisenberg,a new kind of cheerleader movie,8,26 August 2015,"One would expect a cheerleader movie to be an empty one. ""Bring It On"" turns out to be a more creative one. Basically, it shows how the girl appointed captain of the cheerleaders discovers that their act is stolen and she tries to make amends. The movie does have some low humor and other things that we expect in these movies - i.e., the bikini scene - but it's a good movie. A subtle look at the theft of African-American culture by white people (essentially the story of rock 'n' roll; ""Dreamgirls"" focused on this). In the meantime, ""Glee"" presents another look at cheerleaders.PS: a scene in 2001's ""Not Another Teen Movie"" parodied this movie.",Bring It On
3,Quinoa1984,"Ok, terrific",5,29 August 2000,"(Possible spoilers, references to other things also)I know what I am about to review may not be for everyone, I'm sure that plenty of air-headed girls will think this film is a Citizen Kane for the 21st century, but I am speaking for myself and, or, anyone with a partially functioning brain.  This film, uh, uh, sorta SUCKED.  There are plenty of things in this film to show how it could've been better, for instance, they could've made a right instead of a wrong to maybe make this a good satire like Election.  But, in the end, it turns out to be a mutation making the ninja turtles look like Steve Forbes (although I'm not sure if he's human either).  It is a un-needed cross of nickelodeon marketing to kids (so more will see a PG-13 movie) while having dialogue and things in it better left in American Pie.  Which is unfair, because films like American Pie, Election and even South Park, keep with stuff that might be ok for kids (I think) while not being censored.  Well, enough of that, I had enough of that with Coyote Ugly.  Anyway, The plot surrounds a 5-time champion cheerleading tem the Torros (led by a talented yet misused Kirsten Dunst) who have just found out by no fault of they're own that there cheers are actuallt rip-offs of a black team's (another case of the white stealing from the blacks in a hidden message). Some things happen though to help out the Torros, including the hiring of an illegal choreographer (and not getting any punishment at all) and some other dumb plot lines.  While the dancing is somewhat entertaining, the story to back it up smells more than a indian cabbie driving for 72 hours straight. Wacthing this film, and getting dumber and dumber comedy along the way, i yearned for some good things to come out, and nothing came.  Which is why this might seem good to some (mainly the hot bodied and no-brained cheerleaders whbo try to have a film to life connection) but others should beware like a dog in heat.  D",Bring It On
4,michaelRokeefe,May the best moves win!,6,29 August 2001,"Torrance Shipman(Kirsten Dunst)becomes the new captain of the high school cheer leading team that takes pride in winning competition championships year after year. She discovers that the cheers and routines for the last several years have been stolen from another school's squad. Torrance relies on a reluctant gymnast named Missy(Eliza Dushku)to convince the cheer team to learn new material to take to the next state competition. What a shame it is that the football team is so awful that the schools pride is in the cheerleaders. This is an interesting eyeful, but actually just another vehicle for the enticing Miss Dunst.Fine support from:Pua Kapiolani, Tsianina Joelson, Clare Kramer and Nicole Bilderback. If you have a cheerleader fetish, you will think this romp deserves an Oscar. Nonetheless enjoyable.",Bring It On
5,sunwarrior13,A Satire On Cheerleading,6,12 July 2015,"If there is a movie about cheerleading that one could probably enjoy,then this Kirsten Dunst movie entitled Bring It On could be the right one for you. This teen comedy makes fun of cheerleading and it has a story the revolves around Torrance Shipman,who inherits the position of captain of her San Diego high school,who happens to be the six-time championship-winning cheerleading squad. Torrance discovers that being captain of her high school cheerleading squad is extremely demanding and more complicated that she previously imagined.Her parents want her to focus on her studies.Her boyfriend wants to spend more time together.The former captain she learns stole routines from other schools particularly the best ones.And,the captain of their rival school becomes more determined than ever to beat them in this year's competition.It got worse when one of the cheerleaders got injured and she fell in love with Cliff,who apparently does care about cheerleading at all.Torrance tried to overcome all the obstacles that she is faced it and overcame everything humorously in the end.It was evident the movie is leaned towards teen-agers and it presents itself as a satire for cheerleading.It was obviously clichéd and predictable but it became a better-than-average movie through the energetic performance of the cast particularly Kirsten Dunst.Also,there were a lot of humorous scenes that will make you laugh despite the presence of raunchy humor.Overall,it was a feelgood movie.",Bring It On
6,studioAT,Bring It On,2,9 June 2021,"The stars are likable, but this film doesn't amount to much.Not great.",Bring It On
7,hitchcockthelegend,Maybe we should join the team.,7,5 October 2008,"Torrance is the newly appointed captain of cheerleader champions the Toros. After one of the team suffers an accident, the Toros recruit gymnastics star Missy Pantone, but upon witnessing the Toros first routine Missy is disgusted and points out that it has been stolen from another team called The East Compton Clovers. This opens up a whole can of worms that not only brings the Toros into conflict with the Clovers, but also means that they must come up with an original routine if they are to win the American championship honestly.Spirited picture about cheer leading? Well yes it is, it's witty, smart and ever so amiable. Tho the film loses some of its sharpness in the final quarter (a brave ending would have made all the difference), Bring It On clearly touches on race and class issues whilst bringing to the fore the competitiveness of cheerleader teams. The usual formula's of bitching and back stabbing are naturally in here, and of course no film of this type would be complete without some strand of treacle plot love, but the mix is fine and the exuberance of the routines is hugely enjoyable cinema. Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Gabrielle Union and Jesse Bradford fill out the cast and all offer something in the way of watch ability.It could have been so much better for sure, but Bring It On is very entertaining film about a subject that until this picture came out (subsequent sequels would follow) was hardly tackled with this sort of vigour and intelligence before. 7/10",Bring It On
8,preppy-3,"Fun, silly movie",7,8 September 2000,"OK, it has its boring spots and not all the comedy works, but this movie about cheerleading competition is usually very enjoyable.  The acting in uniformly good (especially Dunst) and the movie doesn't take itself seriously once (really, how could it?).  As for all those comments about how this isn't a work of art and makes fat girls feel worthless--come on!  It's just a silly teenage comedy!  This has NO pretensions to be a work of art and anyone who takes it as a serious message movie should have their head examined.  Also the guys are cute in the movie and it's pretty gay positive. My only complaint--couldn't the guys have taken their shirts off just once? God knows there are tons of scenes with the girls scampering around with next to nothing on (all within PG-13 limits though).",Bring It On
9,Uriah43,A Bevy of Attractive Actresses,5,20 October 2018,"This movie begins with a high school student named ""Torrence Shipman"" (Kirsten Dunst) being selected as the captain of the cheerleading team. Needless to say, this is a great honor. However, in this particular case the previous cheerleading teams have won the national championships for 5 years in a row and everybody expects this year's team to be no different. That being said, things start off rather badly when one of the cheerleaders is injured and put out of commission at the very first practice. Needless to say, finding a qualified replacement on such short notice is an extremely difficult task but, as luck would have it, just when things looked extremely bleak a new student by the name of ""Missy Pantone"" (Eliza Dushku) auditions and agrees to take the empty spot so that things can begin to proceed as normal. Unfortunately, just prior to their first competition Torrence learns that the cheers they have worked on for so long have been stolen from another school and to continue with them would severly impact their chances. Not only that, but the team who invented the cheers are extremely good and intend on proving themselves in the national championships as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay comedy for the most part with a few good laughs to be had here and there. Likewise, having a bevy of attractive actresses like Clare Kramer (as ""Courtney""), Nicole Bilderback (""Whitney""), Gabrielle Union (""Isis""), Tsianina Joelson (""Darcy"") and the aforementioned Kirsten Dunst certainly didn't hurt either. On the other hand, however, I must admit that some of the drama was a bit clichéd and the overall plot was rather predictable as well. All things being equal, I suppose it managed to pass the time well enough and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Bring It On
10,anaconda-40658,Bring On A Good Film.,3,10 September 2015,"Bring It On (2000): Dir: Payton Reed / Cast: Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, Gabrielle Union, Clare Kramer: Teen comedy where the girls relate to the events within and guys watch to see the cheerleaders. It is a teen comedy about challenge and a group of cheerleaders who have won three national championships. Kirsten Dunst becomes the leader and discovers that every routine that they have done has been ripped off from another school. This leads to a feud with other schools. Dull plot with repetitious structure and an ending predicted early. Director Payton Reed brings energy to the cheerleading footage but the screenplay isn't very interesting or original. Dunst can bring a lot to a film but here she is basically reciting what has been done before. Eliza Dushku plays the stereotypical tough girl who is talked into cheerleading. Is anyone really surprised when she cracks a smile through her harden face by film's end? Jesse Bradford plays Dushku's brother who will predictably end up romancing Dunst because that is his only basic function here. Gabrielle Union plays the leader of a rival cheerleading squad. Can we say stereotype? Nothing about this film allows any room for originality and just goes through the motions. Effective cheerleading action that may appeal to teenage girls otherwise it does nothing to heighten interest. The screenplay is more talk than action. Score: 3 / 10",Bring It On
11,Wuchakk,It's cheer-tastic (groan),7,24 November 2016,"Released in 2000 and directed by Peyton Reed, ""Bring it On"" is a high school dramedy/satire/sports flick starring Kirsten Dunst as, Torrance, the new captain of a champion San Diego cheering squad. Eliza Dushku co-stars as Torrance's new feisty teammate, Missy, while Jesse Bradford is on hand as Missy's brother and Torrance's possible romantic interest. Torrance and her team are devastated when they discover that their championship routines were ripped-off from an inner city cheer team by the former captain; now they have to learn all-new routines to win the championships in Florida.""Bring it On"" was a surprise minor hit and inspired four direct-to-video sequels (all stand-alone films): ""Bring it On Again"" (2004), ""Bring it On: All or Nothing"" (2006), ""Bring it On: In it to Win it"" (2007) and ""Bring it On: Fight to the Finish"" (2009). Being the only theatrically released movie in the series, ""Bring it On"" is the most polished in the series.While it thankfully lacks visual raunch, like the vulgar ""American Pie"" flicks, it's sometimes verbally lascivious and profane, but in a witty, humorous way. In Roger Ebert's review he went on and on about how ""Bring it On"" is basically an R-rated movie watered down barely enough to get a PG-13 rating to sell more tickets. He decried that it's too foul for kids under 13 and too juvenile for older teens & adults. Although the former's true the latter is poppycock. Anyone who's been to high school (or is going through it) and is slightly familiar with cheerleaders will relate to ""Bring it On"" and be entertained. The flick successfully balances high school dramedy with sports movie conventions while satirizing cheerleaders; it's kinetic, smart, amusing, irreverent, over-the-top and realistic at the same time.Ebert also denounced the film on the grounds that the movie is condescending toward high school minorities. Baloney. It simply reflects reality in that inner city schools in America are predominantly black and lack the funds of more affluent suburban schools.Dunst and Dushku are good protagonists and easily carry the film, but they never appealed to me much, which isn't to say I dislike them. But it doesn't matter because there are so many peripheral cuties on hand. ""All or Nothing"" is easily the best in the series as far as female cast goes (highlighted by Hayden Panettiere and Danielle Savre).The film runs 98 minutes and was shot entirely in the San Diego area.GRADE: B",Bring It On
12,JamesHitchcock,Vulgar Yankee Razzamatazz,5,25 July 2014,"Cheerleading may be a beloved American institution, but it has never really caught on here in Britain. The reasons for this are partly aesthetic (""Vulgar razzamatazz!""), partly nationalist (""Vulgar Yankee razzamatazz!"") and partly feminist. (""Shouldn't women play a more active role in sport than dressing in skimpy costumes and standing on the sidelines to cheer on the men?"")It would, however, appear from ""Bring It On"" that this last objection is also shared by some Americans, as cheerleading has now become a competitive sport in its own right, a sport which, moreover, is open to mixed-sex teams. (I often wonder if competitive cheerleading teams ever have their own non-competitive cheerleaders to cheer them on). The film is set in the fictitious Rancho Carne High School in San Diego, California. There is a running joke that the school's football team, ""the Toros"", are a useless bunch of losers who get soundly thrashed in every game they play, but the school's cheerleading squad, who nominally exist to cheer on the hopeless Toros, are brilliant- in fact they are the reigning national cheerleading champions. The main character in the film is Torrance Shipman, the captain of the cheerleading squad. Despite that male-sounding name, Torrance is a girl. (The squad might be mixed-sex, but the film concentrates far more on the female members than the male ones). In fact, virtually all the female cheerleaders have forenames that sound either sexually ambiguous or even distinctly masculine, generally surnames that have been pressed into service as baptismal names- Torrance, Carver, Whitney, Courtney, Casey, Darcy. There are so many that I wondered if the scriptwriter was indulging in some satire at the eccentric naming habits of American parents. About the only squad member with a recognisably feminine Christian name is Missy (a diminutive of Melissa), but she is an outsider who has recently moved to the school from Los Angeles. Torrance's reign as captain gets off to a bad start when the aforementioned Carver is injured during a training session. Torrance is keen to recruit the aforementioned Missy, who possesses impressive athletic skills, but Missy, a gymnast at her former school, holds to the ""vulgar razzamatazz"" opinion of cheerleading, and only joins the squad (with great reluctance) when she learns that Rancho Carne does not have its own gymnastics team. Missy, however, brings bad news with her. The team's cheerleading routines have all been stolen by their previous captain from an inner-city Los Angeles team, the Clovers. (Intellectual property theft is not, it would appear, actually forbidden in the cheerleading world, although it is strongly deprecated). Other plot lines involve a love-triangle between Torrance, her unreliable boyfriend Aaron and Missy's handsome brother Cliff, and the emergence of the Clovers as Rancho Carne's main rivals at the national finals. I suspect that the original intention was to make the Clovers Irish-American; their clover-leaf emblem recalling the shamrock, their leprechaun-like mascot and their green-and-orange uniforms all suggest Irish associations. In the film, however, they are African-American whereas the Rancho Carne squad are (apart from a token Chinese girl) all Caucasian; doubtless someone thought that a black-versus-white clash would be more dramatic. Kirsten Dunst is neither an outstanding actress nor a striking beauty, yet she has become a popular figure in Hollywood movies, probably because of her ability to project a girl-next-door sweetness. (She even played Marie Antoinette as a girl-next-door Queen of France). This film is a good example of this ability; despite her juggling of two boys we always think of Torrance as the Nice Girl figure. (And, of course, one of the boys turns out to be unworthy of her innocent niceness). It helps that Kirsten, a former child-star, was only eighteen when the film was made, whereas Gabrielle Union, who plays the Clovers' captain Isis, was a full decade older, in keeping with the normal movie convention that the school leaving age is around 30. Of the other acting contributions the only ones worthy of mention are Eliza Dushku's rather truculent Missy and Ian Roberts as Sparky Polastri, the arrogant, self-obsessed choreographer brought in to coach the cheerleaders. The film will probably please fans of organised competitive cheerleading (who are, as I said, more likely to be found across the Atlantic than on this side), and it must be said that the routines are often performed with some energy and skill. Overall, however, this is just another clichéd sporting drama about triumph and tragedy and rivalry and friendship on the sports field and love and romance off it. (See the recent British ""Fast Girls"" for another example of the same thing, albeit about a more mainstream sport). The only original thing about ""Bring It On"" is that it applies these clichés to a sport which had not previously received much attention from Hollywood. 5/10",Bring It On
13,Smells_Like_Cheese,They brought it,7,15 January 2004,"I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this was going to be so stupid, but I decided to watch it with my friends and I got a few laughs. It's not the best movie I've seen, I'm sure same with others. But it's worth a look. It is a teen movie, that's a minus. And Eliza Dusku's character went from punk to teen boppy?

15,Robert_duder,"A guilty pleasure...a comedy, teen classic!! One of my favorites..I admit it",8,29 March 2009,"I don't remember when I first saw Bring It On but I can tell you that since then I've probably seen it 100 times. At one time I might have even told you that this silly, teen, cheerleader romp was a perfect 10 but I have seen it so many times that it has slightly worn thin but not much. Slapstick one liners, cheerleader, valley girl expressions and some rather impressive performances given the genre. There have been many cheerleading movies since, including some decent but, never as good, straight to video sequels, but nothing ever comes close to this film. Some will certainly chastise me and think I am downright crazy for uttering classic around this film, I mean clearly it isn't Gone With The Wind but in it's own genre for what it stands for and what it aims to do it is truly near perfection. The characters are fantastic, the story is an underdog, sports type film but with loads of valley girl teenagers, a silly little romance and plenty of cheerleading stunts. It just has a little bit of everything for a little bit of everyone. Of course there is a key demographic, I think that is pretty clear but anyone who can let loose, put their brain on the back burner can enjoy the film.Teen star Kirsten Dunst headlines the cast just about perfectly. Dunst has always been a decent actor with some very good roles under her belt. However, ironically or not she excels at playing the teen queen role. She also is great at comedy and really lowering her intelligence a little to play her slightly vapid but likable character. Eliza Dushku endeared herself to me as the twisted Faith in Buffy but truthfully her characters never really stray too far from one type and this role wasn't really any different. Still she is great as the tough as nails Missy and her and Dunst are so different and yet make a great pair. Jesse Bradford is also great as Dushku's brother and Dunst's love interest. He has a great knack for comedy and has the quality of being very down to earth. His chemistry is perfect with both girls in their respective roles. The supporting cast just really adds such a great level to the film. They all have such hilarious, great roles and some of the best performances are given by Gabrielle Union, Clare Kramer, Nathan West, Huntley Ritter, Richard Hillman with an absolutely hilarious small little cameo by Ian Roberts as a hired dance instructor.Director Peyton Reed seems to have really come a long way since even this film. Still this was really a break through for his directing. Something about his style really works for bringing this cast together and making the most of it. Somehow Bring It On exceeds the typical teen genre. I don't mean to imply that this film is some feat of film making but it just has this timeless, campy, comedic feel. If you're a teenager or love comedy and you can truly let your brain go for a couple hours this is one that is worth it all the way!! 8.5/10",Bring It On
16,vincentlynch-moonoi,A good mistake,7,12 August 2014,"So here I am, a 50 year old man who wants to see a movie starring Kevin Spacey who plays a teacher. That's all I know. I get to the theater to buy the ticket, look up at the marquee and see a title -- ""Bring It On"". That sounds like the title. About 30 minutes into the film I finally come to the conclusion that what I'm watching is not starring Kevin Spacey, although I kept thinking that he would eventually come into the film...it was in a school. So I almost decide to leave...what do I want with a cheerleader movie. But then I think, what the heck. It is kinda interesting, funny, enthusiastic. Might as well watch it since I already paid my $$$. Later I realize the film I was really looking for was ""Pay It Forward"", not ""Bring It On"".I really enjoyed this movie. As a teacher/school administrator, I rather liked the way the kids were portrayed here...perhaps exaggerated a bit...but pretty much on target. A little raunchy humor, but not much...enough to be funny, not enough to offend. And a good story -- award-winning cheer leading team learns some lessons when they learn their cheers were all stolen from a mostly-minority cheer leading team who couldn't afford to compete nationally. Each team pulls itself up by the bootstraps and then comes the next national competition. Who will win? This was the first film in which I paid any attention to Kirsten Dunst, and she did very nicely here; very believable as the head cheer leader. I'm not familiar with Eliza Dushku, but she does fine here in a role as a sort of out-of-the-mainstream girl who reluctantly joins the cheerleaders. Jesse Bradford is quite engaging as her slightly eccentric brother. Gabrielle Union -- probably the most beautiful actress in Hollywood -- is great as the captain of the other cheer leading team...a little tough, but with just the right balance to be sympathetic. Nathan West is very good as one of the hunky male cheerleaders, as is Huntley Ritter, who plays a gay male cheerleader. The late Richard Hillman is very good at playing an obnoxiously (and fake) supportive two-timing boyfriend. Really, the entire cast does a terrific job, raising what could have been an obnoxious teen-movie into a very good motion picture. Kudos to the director and writer for making this a film that is better than might have been done with such topics.A surprisingly good film that just downright fun...and far above the level you might think it will be.

17,atlasmb,A Teen Flick With Spirit,7,25 May 2020,"Those who think of cheerleading only as it relates to game day rooting from courtside or the sidelines will find this film a good introduction to competitive cheer, where cheer teams compete, using aspects of gymnastics and dance as well as encouragements of audience spirit.The story is about a suburban cheer squad that has to redefine itself in the face of the year's biggest competition. The usual teen tropes are included, so it warrants a C-plus for originality. There is plenty of angst, but no acne.But some good cheer choreography gives the film credibility. And a great message about good sportsmanship (when the team captain takes steps to assure that they will compete against the best) elevates the film.Another plus is the trio casted for three central roles: Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, and Gabrielle Union.",Bring It On
18,ironhorse_iv,"Bring it on! I will defend this semi-dumb comedy film about the world of competitive cheerleading, any-day. It's a guilty pleasure of mine. It's pretty good for what it is.",6,26 October 2017,"Yes, I know, a lot of critics might dislike this movie for its conventional and formulaic mid/late 1990s comedy sport film's plot of two rival school teams going head to head in the national championship, but I found this movie directed by Peyton Reed & written by Jessica Bendinger to be, unique enough to stand out on its own. One of the big changes, they did, was, not make the rival team, into stereotypical ruthless bully jocks. No, the team led by the Isis (Gabrielle Union), are mostly kind to their competitors, and don't really take, any short-cuts, in ruining the protagonist's chances of winning, even after they find out, that Torrance Shipman (Kristen Durst)'s team, stole their routine. It's kinda of a relief, because this movie could had gone badly, with the generic, 'good vs evil' clichés sport flick route. Nevertheless, I could do, without the rich vs poor class warfare, this movie was going for. In truth, San Diego & Los Angeles are surprising, not that far apart, both in numbers of the wealthy and the poor. Another thing, I would love to see, more diversity in both teams. Yes, there was a number of Hispanics & Asian-American in the Toro team, but the Clovers should had been more diverse than what we got. After all, East Compton has a surprising number of white people & plus, Hispanics make up, the majority of that city, based off the 2000 United States Census. Making the team, all African-Americans seem a bit stereotypical. Despite that, another thing, this film does so well, is have, all the actresses really trained for cheering, in order to avoid, the use of stunt doubles. They really do take, lot of difficult and risky move sets, so mad props to them, even if 80% of the dangerous dance/choreography, pyramids, stunting, and tumbling moves in this film are technically illegal & would end in disqualification, due to safety issues. I also love, how the filmmakers even involve physically mistakes in the film performance. It made the film kinda genuine, to see, our heroes still do mistakes, even in their greatest. I also like how charisma, humor, and personality shine through, with all the actresses. All of them, does a great job, both in acting and comedy chops. Lots of funny moments, throughout the film, such as 'Spirit Fingers' sequence & blooper reel, with actresses dancing and lip-sync to B*Witched's cover version of Toni Basil's ""Mickey"". Nevertheless, one thing, I had concern with this film, was the way, the filmmakers push the sexual aspects of cheerleading over the competition nature, a little too much. They should had ease up on the fanservice, a little bit. After all, they are still, underaged high school girls, and the high flying dance sequences should be compelling, enough. No need to make them, into sex symbols with the way too revealing outfits & men in horny little bastards. While, I didn't mind, the romantic subplot of Torrance getting co-captain, Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku)'s brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford). It wasn't really needed for a film, like this. Still, it's surprising, a sport film like this, was even made. It really could had turn into a really bad in sexual objectification to the point, 'Bring it on' could be, like R-rated sex comedy like 1984's 'Gimme an 'F', or worst, adult film driven film like 1978's 'Debbie Does Dallas'. Far below, what I call, entertaining films. Nevertheless, the popularity of the first film, did allow sequels to be made, none of which contain any of the original cast members, nor any good with 2004's 'Bring It On Again', 2006's 'Bring It On: All or Nothing', 2007's 'Bring It On: In It to Win It', 2009's 'Bring It On: Fight to the Finish' and 2017's 'Bring It On: Worldwide #Cheersmack'. For better or for worst, another thing, worth highlighting about 'Bring It On', is the exposure, it had, into bringing back street dance to the mainstream, after being, nearly forgotten, after flops like 1984's 'Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo' & 1985's 'Fast Forward'. It seems like, everybody in Hollywood was producing urban dance movies after this film. Not only that, but this film help inspire, other in-field, sport movie like- music competition such as 2002's 'Drumline' & 2006's 'Stick it'. If that isn't enough to lay claim, why this PG-13 movie is good. To a certain extent, 'Bring it on', also help increase the popularity in recent years to the point, that there is now an estimated 100,000 school team participants in cheerleading national competitions, throughout worldwide. That's really crazy! That's not counting the number of junior varsity teams, which some school has. Overall: 'Bring it on' deserve more credit than it got. It's a wonderful film. While, it's not the best sport comedy, out there. It's one worth cheering for!",Bring It On

The story makes sense, but the toxic egocentric behaviour is a major turn off.Bring It On is good for a bad movie. If it comes down to a John Cena movie or Peacemaker show.

Yes, she completely made me spend a lot of money on her movies.To be honest, this isn't a bad movie for it's audience, I'm talking about teenagers that like these kind of stories.All I can remember about the movie is that it's only worth your time if you are a fan of Kirsten. Otherwise, it would only suit for teenage girls who are into cheer leading, popularity, and those things of college/high school.The plot is like fast food but there's a moral about it that should be given some respect. I love Kirsten's sexy legs in this movie.Overall, this is in my opinion a new classic of these kind of movies.",Bring It On
22,Anonymous_Maxine,This is a cheerleading movie for cheerleading people.,5,8 September 2000,"I was sitting in the theater trying to watch The Art of War, and it was at least 20 minutes late in starting (for the second time), so I decided to go watch the only other movie starting within 45 minutes, Bring It On. I had just finished watching The Replacements when I went to see this film, so I was already sick and tired of cheerleaders when I walked into the theater. As with Coyote Ugly, I knew exactly how this movie would end from the very beginning. I'm not saying that it was a bad movie, it was entertaining enough even though it is not exactly my favorite as far as subject matter, but it is the type of movie that you watch if you have to kill some time. Average acting, an un-exciting plot, and boring and sometimes pretentious dialogue interfere with what could otherwise have been your basic ""sports"" movie. Instead you get a somewhat disappointing, basic ""sports"" movie.A champion cheerleading squad finds out that their previous captain had been stealing routines from an unknown inner city squad, and now they are desperate to come up with something soon before the impending championship begins once more. That's all fine and good, but what do they do? They try to cheat again by hiring a choreographer to teach them a winning routine. Unfortunately, what they get is some sort of cheer Nazi who goes around teaching the same routine to cheer squads all over California. Of course, there is the inevitable rivalry between the two cheer squads which eventually transforms into some kind of awkward friendship, and everyone lives happily ever after. Yawn.Bring It On is just a movie about cheerleaders. If you are a cheerleader or if you just love cheerleaders and can't get enough of their high pitched, annoying antics, watch this movie. You'll probably enjoy it. However, if you are not a hard-core cheerleader fan, you would probably be best advised to ignore this routine movie.",Bring It On

I watch it so often, I can say the words as the characters are saying them.This movie is all about team spirit. This movie is all about cheerleaders. And cheerleading. And teams stealing routines from other squads. And new girls coming on the team. And mean girls not wanting new girls on the team. The list goes on and on.So, the basic rundown of this movies is. At a high school is California (I think), a girl, Torrance, has just been made head captain of her cheerleading squad. A new girl, Missy joins the squad. As Missy watches one of the teams routines, she storms out. We find out that the ex head cheerleader, actually stole the routines from another squad. And those two squads battle it out in the championships. Who's really the better team?Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Bring It On
24,dfranzen70,Cheer we go again,5,28 February 2001,"Bring It On is the story of a championship-caliber high-school cheerleading squad in San Diego that learns some of its most popular cheers have been swiped from a less-privileged school in Los Angeles. The story centers around Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst, all grown up from Interview with the Vampire), who is named as captain of the squad at the outset of the movie, displacing the outgoing, aggressive Big Red (Lindsey Sloane).
Torrance is a forthright person, loyal to the cheerleading squad, full of pep and vigor, and unwilling to cheat to get her way. On her first day as the squad captain, one of the cheerleaders is injured - injured enough to miss any and all future practices, games, and tournaments. Torrance and her crew audition a few students - male and female, and some who aren't old enough to be in high school - and all appears to be lost until Missy Pantone, the stereotypical new-kid-in-school-who's-also-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks, comes along.After much ado and some obvious snobbery on the part of her fellow cheerleaders, Torrance accepts Missy. There's some reluctance on both parts. But before too long, Torrance learns (through Missy) that the cheers that have done so well for the squad for so long have been swiped from a tougher school in LA, one that's perpetually underfunded (conveniently). Oh, and Torrance is also slowly falling for Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford). Oh the complications of being a blonde cheerleader in San Diego! (Hold your cynicism, please!)The thing is, according to the other cheerleaders, swiping cheers is standard operating procedure, so Torrance's ethics are overruled. But then when it comes time for the regional cheerleader tournament (yes, such a beast exists, albeit only in captivity!), they find that yet another squad has duplicated some of their own cheers. The San Diego squad does their own and is reprimanded by the judges.Ok, there's your plot. Fill in the rest as you will. This ain't Shakespeare, folks. Ya gets what ya pays when you see this movie. Don't expect anything all that wonderful. Dunst, however, is a lot of fun as Torrance, and Bradford is her equal as her erstwhile love interest. I will sheepishly admit to laughing out loud at some of the lines in the movie, but overall it wasn't all that impressive. This might be a good movie to watch if you're doing something else, that is, as background material. As cheerleader movies go, it could have been worse (like Satan's Cheerleaders, from 1977).",Bring It On
25,Chris_Docker,Flimsy stuff done rather well,5,22 October 2000,"This is a movie where more talent than necessary has been invested in a film basically aimed at entertainment-seeking adolescents, people interested in dance routines, and a few older men who enjoy watching young girls jump about. It follows the fortunes of an award-winning cheerleader team and the hapless football team they support.A film about cheer leading, something that is, as far as I know, a uniquely American phenomenon, sounds pretty cheesy. The remarkable thing is that the acting and dialogue raise it a bit above the minimum required and the cheer leading dance sequences are a revelation for anyone who thought it was just about waving arms in the air and shouting support for the football team.Gabrielle Union (10 Things I Hate About You) and Kirsten Dunst (Drop Dead Gorgeous & Virgin Suicides) were both cheerleaders at school - did this help with the authenticity? The amazing routines are quite dazzling to watch - requiring a very high level of stamina, physical fitness, athletic ability and dance technique. The overhead panning brings them almost to the level some of the old song and dance movie scenes with synchronized dancing. Synchronized dance in itself is difficult stuff, but fast paced synchronized dancing (to a great soundtrack, by the way) involving major aerial throws, difficult jive moves and lots of personality thrown in, is quite an achievement.The film never takes itself too seriously, from the football announcer who says at the end of the match, ""our next defeat is scheduled for next Tuesday"", to the out-takes while the credits roll, the attitude is firmly tongue in cheek.The script includes plenty of teenage bitching reminiscent of Clueless (adolescents often seem to show their intellectual prowess at clever, and often vicious repartee, that is all par for the course), but the acting is convincing and even the awkward issues of race and homosexuality are handled well. One cannot but help congratulate them for making a good film out of such a flimsy premise.",Bring It On
26,noralee,Cheerful Teen Satire,7,12 December 2005,"My older son recommended I see ""Bring It On."" His critical view, given that he was probably dragged there by his girlfriend, was that it wasn't as good a teen satire as ""Election"" or ""Clueless"" but was better than the usual teen movies. I'd rate it with the WB's ""Popular"" series, combining satire and some social consciousness (including fair racial commentary on rhythm and class) and funny one-liners. I particularly enjoyed the cheerfully indulgent references to other teen faves, such as the opening which is clearly a funny commentary on ""American Beauty,"" the references to ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" as this movie co-stars the actress who plays ""Faith"" on the series. I'm not sure the teens would get the ""Risky Business"" tribute or the imitation of a key ""My So-Called Life"" scene.As a dentist's daughter, I thought the teeth brushing flirtation will definitely encourage more teenagers to brush at night before they go to bed (not sure though if they will be alone or together).The closing credits with salacious cheers and out-takes where the actors break character into their real ages' behavior continues the cheerful humor. The theater was quite full, even several weeks after opening.(originally written 9/24/2000)",Bring It On

If you ask me, Torrance (Kirsten Dunst) and the Rancho Carne Toros were an excellent cheer-leading squad! The only characters I really couldn't stand Isis (Gabrielle Union) and the East Compton Clovers. This was because they were really snobby. However, I enjoyed their cheers very much. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Three cheers for Kirsten Dunst!"" Now, in conclusion, if you like movies about cheerleaders, this is the one to see.

Surprising performance from her after being the Bad Slayer in BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Awesome cheer-leading routines. Has to be a sport in its own right, this cheer-leading, much like rhythmic gymnastics. And those girls getting tossed up into the air really should get Danger Pay! Bit of a lame ending, though. Pity the movie tried very hard to be politically correct so that 'the white-girl team' HAD to lose against 'the black-girl team' despite the Rancho Carne performance during the finals being the more graceful one. Yes, the Clovers were confident, looked stronger, but they were really just more voracious, less girlie and of a heavier built. Give me the Rancho Carnes any day!",Bring It On
29,TOMNEL,The girls ended up doing the stolen routine,2,14 March 2007,"I find this movie to be just awful. It is the biggest cliché ever, and to top that off, the only thing that it has going for it is a fresh look. The acting in this aside from a couple of the main girls is just awful. Several scenes of dialogue with no camera cuts are shown, and the words said go in one ear and out the other. It's really hard to listen to this awful drivel. The only, and I mean only thing that this has, is it's stylish camera work. The movie looks very modern with interesting camera angles and a stylish, flashy look. To make this super appealing to 11 year old girls they added really unnecessary cussing. I think cussing can often help a film to express strong feelings or portray certain cultures, but this movie must use the s word 50 times, and in stupid cases. ""Our team is the sh*t.""

30,caspian1978,Eye Candy.....nothing else,4,9 September 2001,"Bring It On is just another example of the Studios failing to capture the youth of America. None of these characters exist in real life. Even for the pulp cultured, brain dead youth in the LA area, there are no realistic people in this film. Terrible dialogue with a terrible story, the only worth watching (sad to say ) scenes were the ""sexual"" moments in the locker room and at the car wash. This movie didn't make it big at the cinemas because of its PG-13 rating. Right off the bat, only girl 10-14 were going to see this movie. If it was rated R, most teenaged boys and horny, single men in their early 30's would have turned out to the movies in hope to see some nudity. What else are cheerleader movies good for anyway. Face the facts, the only thing that saved this movie was the eye candy from the two female leads. Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushka. Still, the acting was very bland and un-motivated. Some of the worst acting I have ever scene, if it wasn't for the visual beauty throughout the film, I would have left during the first 10 minutes.",Bring It On

The characters are not annoying for the most part, and I especially enjoyed seeing new faces Elisa Dushku (Missy) and Jesse Bradford (Cliff).  They have screen presence and should be in front of the camera for many years to come, especially Elisa, who is really very beautiful.  When you look at her, there's so much there, unlike most actresses whose faces do not say anything.  You can tell there is alot going on in her mind just by her face. The screenplay is intelligent and very funny and aside from a slow stretch or two, I really liked the movie. It is not like ""Clueless"" or anything else, which of course is a good thing. One of my favorite scenes is when Cliff and Torrance (Kirsten Dunst) are brushing their teeth.  Its probably a throw-away scene and there is no dialogue, but it was really great, for me at least.",Bring It On

33,triple8,For the true blue cheerleader. This isn't a bad movie but a bit predictable and didn't do much for me.,5,11 January 2004,"SPOILERS THROUGH:It's not that there's anything AWFUL about Bring it on but it really is tailer made to fit a certain viewing audience-if your not a teen or a former cheerleader I can't see this being a favorite-though I could be wrong. I myself watched it late night and though I will say I wasn't to bored, it didn't do much for me either.What I didn't like most were two things: the attempts at comedy, most of which weren't to funny, and the whole ""formula"" feel to it. Toward the end, at the contest when that line is uttered: ""remember to bring it on""-it was sweet but so forced too, it's a bit hard to take seriously-I'm not putting the movie down at all because, man, it's better then a lot of the garbage that's out today- and the movie has a sweet message.I'd still say, not being a cheerleading fanatic I'd love to see a movie that's a bit different and more of a character study on professional cheerleaders or something along those lines. On the plus side here as mentioned, the movie's message is sweet and the cheerleading itself with all the cool moves was fun to watch, as they did an excellent job with that . This really isn't my kind of thing but it's not awful. I've seen better movies but I've also seen worse.",Bring It On

Is it possible to work it out, without an extensive knowledge of current Californian slang?Not an unpleasant movie, but the aftertaste is sour.  There was no need at all for Torrance to exhibit moral weakness once (continuing to use the her predecessor's chants when she knew them to be stolen), let alone twice (hiring a shady professional choreographer).  By the time of the final showdown the waters have become so muddied that it's impossible to enjoy ANY possible result.  And is it just me, or did everyone look alarmingly skinny? The choreographer orders one of the girls on a diet after making a wisecrack about her enormous backside, which we see,  and while it would be nice if she DID have an enormous backside, the widest angle lens the cameraman dare use can't hide the fact that this supposedly curvy girl is as thin as the rest of them - i.e., flirting with anorexia.I liked it while watching, largely because its heart's in the right place, and it isn't as idiotic a teen movie as most others.  But on reflection it's seriously misshapen.",Bring It On
35,eric262003,Too Much Language and Sexual References Can Be Off-Putting,6,29 February 2016,"After watching ""Bring It On"", I was aghast at finding out that this film was rated PG-13. The reason for my analogy was that this movie may have opened up a plethora of films of this magnitude, this movie could have been inches away from being rated R if not for them taking out the sexuality or even the nudity for that matter.I'm really saying this movie was entirely bad, it was fun to the point of being a guilty pleasure, but the demographics this film has an appeal to is towards the younger teenage demographics by contrast to the older age demographics. I might be getting old before my time, but if you want to show a film about cheer-leaders in their appealing clad apparel, utilizing sexual references through their dialogue, at least let it be towards higher education students. That way they can talk like that, get naked and make out with their lovers. Kirsten Dunst stars Rancho Carne High School student Torrance Shipman who has now been appointed as Captain of their squad, The Toros. They have been an excellent squad except they've been duplicating their moves from an East Compton inner-city squad known as the Clovers. The Clovers are now heading out to the competition and Torrance gets reassurance from the rival squad who hires a choreographer to teach them new moves only to humbled at the regional contest when another team usurps them into doing their moves before they had a chance to compete. But before they surrender, there is still three weeks left for the Toros to rectify from their humiliation to compete in the nationals (they get a free pass on account of how good they are the previous years). Torrance motivates her squad to collaborate and to come up with moves so that they can get revenge and to smoke the competition off its feet. We also are treated to the schmaltzy boyfriend went off to college and there's a new boy in town story thrown in for good measure, along with the heated exchanges with the inner-city kids, there's the climactic question of is it cool to play fair or to cheat puzzlement and the homophobic question if male cheerleaders are gay? So while there are tons of subplots, the cramming is very limited. If that's not enough, these kids seemed to have lost virginity at 13 years old because they seem to be experienced it and insinuate in the duration of the film. Sure I like seeing competitive films about going against the odds overcoming the hurdles, even I found myself cheering during the competition, it was an enjoyable chick-flick. And though teens will likely indulge in a movie of this magnitude, but the overwhelming sexual references could've easily been omitted. And though the one- liners were laughable, still the Junior Highs will likely ask their parents the definition of ""cheer sex"".If they would have cleaned up the overly utilized sexual innuendos and made it more about competition and the training leading up to it, then this movie would've been 10x better. Hell make them college students and that would appeal to older teens and twenty year-old people then it wouldn't have been so bad. If the cinematic community had the gonads they should implement an R rating. Everything about this movie worked.From the competitive scenes to the love story and the bickering is believable and the teen angst is spot on. It's just a bit too dirty for my liking. The R rating should have been placed on the package.",Bring It On

Kirsten Dunst plays the ""Toros"" fearless leader, determined to bring home the silverware but only if it's earned fairly against the best competition, Union's ghetto-styled high school the best of the rest, but financially unable to compete. Predictably, all the planets align and the two face off in the competition for top honours and most honourable in the lessons learned department.Dunst is undeniably appealing as the featherweight cheerleader who takes people as they come, Bradford is her would-be suitor (she has a boyfriend, albeit an unfaithful one), and personally I thought that Ian Roberts as the tyrannical dance consultant was the funniest moment in the movie; his sage tips on a cheerleader's optimal 'weight' and the correct dexterity needed for 'spirit fingers' will transcend the time it takes to forget the rest of this movie.It's not the titillation-style cheerleader movie you might have come to expect, by-and-large a very wholesome affair that keeps the focus on the ""sport"", and limits the surrounding melodrama.

38,Screen_Blitz,"Bring It On is a funny, if formuliac teen comedy for teens and adults alike",8,1 February 2016,"With many sports-based flick centering on football, basketball, baseball, and other sorts, cheerleading is a sport that's very underpopulated in the sports genre, with many debating on whether or not it is an actual sport. This teen comedy directed by Peyton Reed places the under-appreciated sport at the pinnacle of its funny, though formulaic story. Generating light-heart laughs and teen-friendly charm without diving into the territory of R-rated vulgarity, this sports-based comedy stands just as your average teen laugh-out-loud with nothing particularly special beyond its unoriginal execution. Nonetheless, it is a feel-good story of determination and wit that many teens can relate to, especially for those who grow up on the cheer squad (like me). This movie stars Kirsten Dunst as high school cheerleader Torrance Shipman, who begins her senior year as cheer captain of her team who's made first place in Cheer Nationals for six consecutive years. Eager to lead her team to victory for the seventh year, Torrance's effort to make it to Nationals becomes a hassle when she discovers their previous cheer captain Red (played by Lindsay Sloane) has been stealing routines from the East Compton High. With time running short and East Compton cheer captain Isis (played by Gabrielle Union) threatening to turn the tables on them, Torrance must come with a solid, original routine to compete in Cheer Nationals in Daytona. What do we have here? Another sports flick revolving around a high school team fighting to claim their victory for the championship title? Sure. Upon sitting through the hour mark, it is becomes almost thoroughly predictable what the final outcome would as the plot never quite goes beyond relying on typical sports clichés including the anxiety of making it the finals, or picking up a team that is suffering in the ruts. That is not say that the film doesn't leave any room for some sweet, feel-good humor to make up the Peyton Reed's formulaic direction. Most of the characters, particularly Kirsten Dunst's Torrance Shipman, are very likable and stand as effective sources for good laughs. While some of the jokes either don't quite land or fall under the category of clichéd, easily one of the most proficient aspects the story has going for it is capturing the spirit of high school angst including the lead character developing a discrete crush on one of her teammates' older brother. The cheer routine sequences however, are obviously the film's most stellar highlights, with the first hilarious, but botched cheer sequence setting the tone of the plot. There is also an inspiring message about teamwork handed throughout the plot. But honestly, is that really something new? In terms of performances, the cast is mostly solid but unsurprisingly nothing that stands out. Bring It On is fun, smart, and witty comedy that will very likely please teens and adults alike. Although this film isn't exactly on the A-list of teen comedies, it is definitely one that is fresh and stands out among lot of the other dumb and clichéd teen comedies today.

Since the plot of the movie also involves unfair tactics, it's clear that it's not as silly as it looks on the surface.Okay, it is possible to enjoy the movie purely for its obvious pleasures, but Jessica Bendinger's screenplay (though not exactly ""Lucas"" or ""The Chocolate War"") does have some points to make about the extent people are willing to go to win, whether legally or illegally; there's also a welcome undertone of liberality (the cheerleader squads include guys, but it's the footballers that receive most of the ridicule - one of the best bits about the movie is when the school football team arrives to much less of a welcome than the pep squad). The film also takes an interesting attitude towards the Toros (the squad who's won the national championships for the past five years) and the Clovers (the team who are to all intents and purposes the underdogs); though the former Toros team captain (Clare ""Glory from 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'"" Kramer) has been swiping the Clovers' routines for years, ""Bring It On"" both resists the temptation to stack everything in favour of the Clovers and has the Toros be caught in another (unintentional) duplication of someone else's routine at the tryouts; some more screen time given to the Clovers in general and their captain (Gabrielle Union) in particular would have helped the movie even more, since the relationship that develops between the two captains is underdeveloped on film.Some of the routines done in the contest climax seem a bit too complex, and you do have to wonder about a few of the plot points, but overall the movie's an above-average teen pic that's performed with enthusiasm (especially by the leads, although Eliza Dushku is the real star of the movie) and has one of the less objectionable song soundtracks of its breed. ""Bring It On"" can be accused of taking what many understandably don't consider a sport too seriously, but look at how many bad movies have been made out of ""real"" sports - this is no ""Hoosiers"" or ""The Bad News Bears,"" but it's also no ""Wind"" (the unspeakably boring America's Cup movie) or ""Split Decisions"" (about boxing). Better cheerleading than golf, I say - and as a commentator says during the movie, ""Any sport that combines gymnastics, dance and short skirts is okay by me.""Just one query: Why is there a visual effects supervisor credited? The Misses Dunst, Dushku, Union and Lindsay Sloane do that job perfectly well, thank you very much (particularly in the carwash scene and the ""Puttin' On The Hits""-type sequence over the credits).""I'm sexy, I'm cute/I'm popular to boot...""",Bring It On

48,ivo-cobra8,Classic cheer for the best teen movie and an original film,10,16 October 2015,"Bring It On (2000) is a underrated teen cheerleading movie with Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku. It is my favorite high school teen comedy and I honestly don't care what anyone says about this film. A champion high school cheerleading squad discovers its previous captain stole all their best routines from an inner-city school and must scramble to compete at this year's championships. I love this film. Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) was the most memorable and my favorite character from my all time favorite actress Kirsten Dunst. I went trough high school watching this film. I love sport comedy films, like were Major League (1989) and I love this team sport comedy film. It was followed by four direct-to-video sequels, none of which contain any of the original cast members. Bring It on is original true, the best, cheerleading comedy in the film series. I love this film and I always will, it is my favorite film of all time. At least it is much better than they are teen comedy this days. Jessica Bendinger wanted to mix cheerleading and hip-hop, the two tastes that taste great together, it's like peanut butter and chocolate, which she did. The choreography very beautiful, the dance moves were pretty good and amazing. Long before ""Pitch Perfect"" became a hit franchise and every group of women became our #squadgoals, there were the Toros and the Clovers. Fifteen years ago this month, Universal released ""Bring It On"" into theaters, a low budget, high-school comedy about rival cheerleading teams that spawned four spin off films, a stage musical, and helped pave the way for the Barden Bellas, the McKinley glee club and many more The plot of the film centers on Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), who inherits the position of captain on her high school's cheerleading squad and attempts to lead her team to a sixth national title. However, Torrance is informed by the newest team member, Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku), that she is in possession of a stolen routine. When the originators of the work vow to win, Torrance and her squad must go to different lengths in order to create an original performance.The Toro cheerleading squad has spirit, spunk, sass and a killer routine that's sure to land them the national championship trophy for the sixth year in a row. But for newly-elected team captain, Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), the Toro's road to cheer glory stumbles when she discovers their perfectly choreographed routines were stolen from a hot hip-hop squad across town. Now the squad must scramble to find a new routine to compete in this year's competition.I love this movie and I am not saying that as a blonde or a cheerleader! No offense : / This is the best Bring It On movie out of all of them. Kirsten Dunst in an amazing actress. This movie is funny, very cute, and the original Bring It On! At Rancho Carne High School, cheerleading is everything to student Torrance (Kirsten Dunst), who aching to be named head cheerleader of school squad the Toros, continuing the aggressive pursuit of dominance started by graduating member, Big Red (Lindsay Slone). Requiring a new cheerleader to help fill a gap caused by an accident, the squad welcomes Missy (Eliza Dushku) to the team, though the new student isn't sure her cynical ways are a good fit, while her brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford), welcomes the assimilation, attracted to Torrance and her indefatigable spirit. When she realizes routines established by Big Red are actually stolen from the East Compton Clovers, led by icy Isis (Gabrielle Union), Torrance loses confidence, requiring support from the splintered Toros and outside influences as she attempts to rebuild what was lost. Director Peyton Reed and screenwriter Jessica Bendinger (who tried to reheat her formula for 2006's ""Stick It"") favor bigness when it comes to the antics contained in ""Bring It On."" Summoning blinding cheerleading spirit, the production turns the quest for trophies into a cartoon, complete with aggressive close-ups and screamed line readings, while the writing retains finger-snap timing and an interest in developing its own vocabulary (e.g. Torrance demanding that the Toros are not a ""cheerocracy""), always on the go in terms of characterization and plotting (a mid-movie detour with the Toros and a professional choreographer harboring an obsession with ""spirit fingers"" is amusing). The rating I am giving is 10/10 for been Entertained sport film. The film isn't perfect, it has flaws. The Toros cheerleading squad should have win on the end of the film and they didn't. That move hurt the film. In all the sequels all cheerleading squad team won in this film they didn't. The film is good because of Kirsten Dunst. Believe it or not, it's been 15 years since everyone's favorite campy cheerleader movie, ​Bring It On​, debuted. Kirsten Dunst, aka captain Torrance Shipman, appeared on ​The Late Late Show With James Corden ​last night and talked about her first major lead role. ""None of us knew it would become a hit,"" she says. ""We were just a couple of young people in San Diego making a Universal film no one cared about.10/10 Grade: A Studio: Beacon Communications Starring: Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, Gabrielle Union, Clare Kramer Director: Peyton Reed Producers: Marc Abraham, Thomas Bliss Screenplay: Jessica Bendinger Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 1 Hr. 38 Mins.

49,movies2u,Great fun!,9,11 June 2001,"Bring It On is a fun movie. The music is cool and the cheerleading moves are good. Kirsten Dunst did a good job in her role as Torrance. This movie is exciting, and reminds me of Coyote Ugly. Maybe It's because they dance in both movies. When this movie came out in theaters, I didn't get to see it, but I rented it, and I really liked it! The acting was good and the directing was good. If you liked Coyote Ugly, you should like this film! I give it a 9 out of 10! This movie is very good and funny! I recommend it!",Bring It On
50,the red duchess,"Fresh, intelligent, fiercely self-aware comedy.",6,6 February 2001,"This delightful comedy uses its ostensible theme of cheerleading rivalry to comment on its own genre, the teen movie.  Given a genuinely exciting reinvention by 'Clueless', and reaching a peak with the likes of 'American Pie' and '10 Things I hate about you', the genre is in danger, as all successful genres are, of exchanging its wit, visual exuberance, engaging playing and agreeable sentiment for cash-hungry formulae and all-round laziness.  'Bring it on' falls into neither of these traps, but is aware that its genre is exhausting itself, and raises a number of pertinent issues.  do filmmakers, like the Toro cheerleaders, continue their success by ripping off others' tricks?  Is it possible to be original any more, or is the best we can hope for a clever spin on older, wider sources (this, of course, applies to cinema and all art in general)?  Most pertinent, and 'Road Block' had already touched on this, is it time we jettisoned the toothy, white, middle-class young, and their oh-so-harrowing traumas, and allow a more representative teen demographic into the tacitly racist genre? 
'Bring it on' may not entirely escape this last accusation - the black cheerleaders have no real humanity of their own, we are not given the same insight into their backgrounds and personalities as the white girls, beyond catch-all under-privilege.  They are a mirror in which the whites can examine their complacency or flaws and correct them - literally so in many scenes, where the whites 'reflect' the blacks' movements, and the latter distort them in return, thereby commenting on them.  However, this touchy racial subject matter has a major benefit on the narrative arc.  The plot is the old stand-by: a team of underdogs against the odds, triumph against circumstances and expectations.  This would be tiresomely formulaic, except there are two teams in the film with equal claims on our attention and sympathies - it would be unthinkable for a Hollywood film today to have poor black people lose against pampered whites, but every stylistic decision - the humanising of characters; the rites of passage and socialising-of-misfits narrative; screen-time etc. - favours these whites.  This creates a genuine tension, added to little asides (such as Torrence's brother's T-shirt, 'Cheerleading = Death') that make a familiar narrative interesting, problematic and unpredictable. 
This is not to deny the familiar pleasures of the genre - the beautiful, clothes-shy young stars (the film gets to leer and satirise such leering!); the witty dialogue and bitchiness; the screenplay sharp about traditional issues of power and community; revelatory, stylised dreams and memories; the unforced energy.  'Bring it on' is a rare instance in the last few decades of a musical, and the various cheerleading routines are exhilerating and inventive, revealing to many a hitherto hidden purpose of a much maligned group, while still retaining the right to tongue-hollow that cheek.  (AND a Shakespearean finale, where the actors come back after the curtain, and show us it was all play).",Bring It On
51,FlickJunkie-2,High Energy Entertainment,8,24 February 2001,"A crowd pleaser of a film, `Bring It On' is essentially a high school sports story for girls.  Though the cheering squad has boys on it, the film is clearly dominated by the young women.  This represents a fresh entry into that genre, as I can't remember ever seeing another film that focuses on competitive cheerleading.  The film is actually well constructed, with an interesting story underlying numerous highly athletic cheerleading scenes.Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is the new captain of the National Champion cheerleading squad from Rancho Carne High (that name cracks me up, literally translated it means `Meat Ranch').  She discovers that the former captain stole all their cheers from an inner city high school and this year that high school intends to compete in the regional championships with the same routine.  Torrance has to come up with a new routine in just a few weeks. This is an appealing twist on the normal sports story because it focuses on the champions as the underdogs (like the Rocky sequels).  They also throw in a Cinderella story with the East Compton Clovers, who are coming from obscurity to compete at the national level.The film is lively, energetic, and generally fun to watch, although we aren't delving into the mysteries of the universe here.  It takes cheerleading seriously and attempts to legitimize it as a serious endeavor, dealing candidly with the team members' self consciousness about their own sport.  The teen scenes are well written, giving a frank look at some real issues teens face, like the back biting rivalries and mocking condescension between cliques.  They even pack in a teen love story to further engage their target audience, which is clearly teenage girls.Kirsten Dunst is spunky, perky, sprightly, vivacious, and otherwise youthfully exuberant.  In short, she is perfect for the part.  While it is true, a strong breeze could have blown Torrance away (literally and figuratively) Dunst captures the emotions and concerns of her character realistically and effectively (Dunst's being 18 undoubtedly helped).  There are numerous other good performances.  I am particularly impressed with Eliza Dushku as Missy.  She is by far the most substantial character in the film and brings a great deal of maturity to the part.  Among the entire cast, Dushku is the only actor I can see succeeding in role outside the teen genre.  Gabrielle Union, as Clovers' team captain Isis, is powerful and audacious and gives the entire Clovers team a strong image.  I also enjoyed Cody McMains as Torrance's sarcastic kid brother who goes to see his sister compete in the National Championships wearing a Cheerleading = Death tee-shirt.This is a good film for young girls and is highly entertaining for just about anyone.  It was a resounding financial success grossing seven times its meager $10 million budget.  It is well directed and has numerous funny high school moments, along with plenty of scenes where teens take themselves all too seriously.  I rated it 8/10, since it is better than many of the films in its genre.  It's true that it is cotton candy cinema, (insubstantial but sweet), however it is worth seeing if you enjoy teen flicks.",Bring It On

54,chrisbrown6453,I didn't go in thinking Bring It On will be winning any awards any time soon.,7,18 July 2001,"I actually only went to see it since it appeared at the time it would be the number one movie in the country. But much to my surprise it wasn't all that bad. Cheesy? Yes. Bad dialogue? Absolutely. Fun? I thought it was. It didn't take itself so seriously that it was horrible, and it took itself seriously enough that it was fun watching these kids cheerlead their little hearts out.The plot... well the 5 time national champion cheerleaders from Rancho Carne High School in San Diego (they're the Toros) find out that all their award winning cheers were actually stolen from the cheerleaders at East Compton High (they're the Clovers). So now if they want to keep their championship dreams alive, they need to come together as a team and create their own, original cheer, and cheer like they've never cheered before. Lead by their captain Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst), the Toros make it back to the national championships, and go head to head with the Clovers to see who really is the best darn cheerleaders in the country. Yes, the plot is cheesy, but I think that was going to be a very obvious thing from the beginning. The movie is about cheerleading after all. Not that I have anything against cheerleaders, but a movie that centers around the trials and tribulations of cheerleaders is not going to have a serious and deep story. The dialogue was appropriately bad and yes, cheesy enough to make you wish that it were serious and deep. However when you have the bright, peppy and beautiful Dunst in the lead, how can you not smile and cheer right along with all of them?Also along for the ride, one of my personal favorite actresses, the not-yet-but-soon-to-be-popular Eliza Dushku, from Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame. In my book, she's right up there as far as looks go. She plays Missy, the hardened transfer student who joins the cheerleading squad only because the school doesn't have a gymnastics program. Making her start off as a bad-ass, then saying she was a gymnast didn't feel right to me. But she comes around pretty quickly and she and Torrance become fast friends. Also, since this is a teen dramedy, Torrance and her off to college boyfriend have problems, and Missy's brother Cliff is right there to help Torrance out with all her cheerleader angst. OK, so obviously the only reasons any guy would go see this movie is because either his girlfriend dragged him along, or because he wants to see a bunch of girls in cheerleader outfits, and tight clothing. And really, can you blame him? The girls are attractive, and putting them into various stages of dress, and undress, certainly can't hurt the grosses. Locker room scenes, bikini car wash scenes, and of course the cheerleading scenes were worth the price of admission for me (which of course was only $3.75, one of the perks of living in suburbia).The soundtrack was pretty cool, and the dance/cheerleading sequences were actually quite well done. And the fact that the movie never wavered from its position that to these girls (and some guys) cheerleading was very important. To a majority of us who have never cheerleaded, it's easy to say that it's not anything to get worked up about, but I look at it like if you said that to a football player in a Texas high school, you'd probably be shot on sight. Cheerleading is important to the cheerleaders, and that's what this movie was about. Cheerleading. And hot girls in cheerleading outfits. Sorry, I am a guy afterall.So overall, yes Bring It On is cheesy with some over the top dialogue. But it also has some good music, some good cheerleading scenes, and of course, it has the girls. It's not something that is going to be heard over the microphone at next years Academy Awards, but I thought it was just good summer fun.",Bring It On
55,bbewnylorac,Excellent film,9,16 September 2013,"High points of this very cool movie include the snappy, witty script, the brilliant cast, excellent choreography and, above all, not taking itself seriously. It centres around a year in the life of all-American schoolgirl Tor (Kirsten Dunst), who is elected head cheerleader. If you just saw it as being about the 'difficulties' she faces -- boyfriend trouble, being accused of plagiarising routines, bullying, injuries, annoying sibling and parents -- you'd laugh, because this is not exactly Afghanistan. It's rich, white LA. But the film sends this up mercilessly. It presents, you suspect, a fairly accurate rendition of this strange sport, and manages to be both affectionate towards it, but also to poke fun at all its conventions. Tor's new friend, the gymnast Missy, openly laughs at the sport, before realising it offers her the chance to make friends at her new school. But basically most of the scenes are highly entertaining, from cliquey princesses Courtney and Whitney's bitching about people auditioning for the squad, to the poorer East Compton team cajoling an Oprah-like talk show host to fund their trip to the finals. The characters are all well developed and everyone gets at least one scene in which to shine.",Bring It On
56,TaylorYee94,I never get tired of this movie.,8,11 August 2020,"From time to time when I miss my teenhood and carefreeness at that time, I watch this movie and indulge myself with coziness and laziness for two hours. It's like time machine, and I always get smile after this movie.I watch this film over and over again and never get tired, meaning that the story makes senses and is easy to follow. The protagonist overcomes difficulties and finds true love which can be a typical story, but the writer manages to make it not boring and cliche. Characters are adorable and distinctive, and I praise actors who bring those characters alive.I love that the Clovers win finals. It is way more realistic and it avoids cliche that the protagonist can do and achieve whatever he or she sets mind, a BOILER PLATE HAPPY ENDING . Often the rival of the main characters are described as villains, but in reality or when you look at the story from the other side, it can be reversed. Clovers do not deserve to be just villain in the story, and the writer does a good job looking at them in multi dimensional point of view.",Bring It On

58,rlcsljo,By the numbers cheerleading Flick,5,28 August 2000,"Kirsten Dunst has done about 35 films in her relatively short life.  Its hard to believe after all that experience she can not act her way out of a paper bag.  Her lack luster performance keeps a perfunctory script pretty much in the land of mediocrity.  The black cheerleaders try their best to add some needed talent to the fray, but they are not on the screen long enough to make a difference.An attempt to put a ""Clueless"" spin on the romance side was written by someone who was equally clueless.In the film she becomes cheerleader captain of some of the most overweight ""champion"" high school cheerleaders you will probably ever see (although some light is made of this fact in the movie).  They also seem to have won their championships without a coach!.The cheerleading routines where pretty much standard and their execution would have probably landed them a 5th or 6th place at the nationals.If you want to see better, more original routines, see ""Gimme an 'F'"".

Her squad do not have enough money to pay for their travelling expenses to the national championships.Both captains facing different set of problems, but only one squad can emerge as the winner when the big day arrives. Which side will have all the moves eventually? The cheerleading scenes in the movie certainly do bring up some memories of myself when for a period of time, I was also part of a cheerleading squad (which I eventually withdraw from it). Watching all the spunk and moves that the cheerleaders are showing, it does certainly make me admire how much hard work the girls (and the guys) had been putting in.",Bring It On
61,higherall7,The Black and White of Ideas,7,16 January 2013,"When I was rehearsing my one-act play 'The Arms of Infinity' at the Concept East Theater that used to be on Adams street here in Detroit, the great James Wheeler used to talk about how fashion designers would come here and cruise the streets intently studying what African Americans were wearing this year and that later, you would find the same designs that folks had thrown together selling for top dollar in the most fashionable salons and stores across America. I'll have to admit I didn't put much stock in this, or simply shrugged 'so what', but the movie 'Bring It On' brought this subject up again and seemed to validate my mentor's assertion and observation. The movie also reminded me of something Picasso was quoted as having said; ""You either do it first, or you do it better.""'Bring It On' is a lighthearted look at how Western Culture feels privileged to appropriate ideas from other cultural milieus without making proper acknowledgement that it has done so. There was a knowing nod from me and others in the audience when vivacious Torrance is given a 'reality check' that the winning routine her cheer-leading squad is famous and renowned for actually comes from an all-black cheer-leading squad led by the beautiful Isis. This was a tiny glimmer of light emitted from raising up the lid just a degree to see what was actually cooking in our cultural melting pot. Somehow it always seems novel to me when it is revealed that African Americans, Indians, and various other peoples of the Orient such as the Japanese, the Chinese and the folks of India actually did have a better idea and are the source of successful actions that can be broadly applied for the benefit of all.When I was young, every major accomplishment or idea worthy of note owed its source to some Caucasian mind. At the time, in elementary school, I just wanted my 'A's and the sheer thrill of excelling, though I could have forgone the cookie we got when I would be invited to the Principal's office with a few other students for having made the honor roll. It rarely occurred to me to question how this could be so. That is, how History was basically a collection of success stories about White People. How they were largely responsible for the quality of life in the world, all the major inventions and advances in technology and were presently investigating and plumbing the secrets of the Universe. As long as the cookies and the punch kept coming at the end of each semester, what did I care?I loved giving reports on the lives of famous men who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and did something with their lives. People like Theodore Roosevelt, the nerd who became a He-Man, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, Daniel Boone and the various Indian Fighters. Therefore I was surprised when I did my report on Frederick Douglass at the irritated suggestion of my father asking (""-why don't you ever do any reports on Black People?'); that my teacher didn't know who he was! She stopped me in the middle of my report and called in the Assistant Principal who admitted she never heard of him either! After that, the teacher from next door was called in but she didn't have a clue. So I was told it was great I decided to do a report about somebody who was 'active in the community', but I really better sit down now.Where I am going with all this is that the one of the most closely guarded secrets is how many non-Western minds are responsible for the shape of the World as it exists today. It's a wonderful thing to investigate and opens up a new dimension on reality that is at once invigorating and exhilarating. I love finding out that Pizza and Spaghetti actually have their origins in China, that the Pilgrims were having a hard time of it through some rough winters until the Indians shared their technology with them, that George Washington Carver played a large role in developing the K-Rations for soldiers in the field, and that a fictional white Cheer-leading Squad called the Toros were best able to win when they modeled themselves after another fictional black Cheer-leading Squad called the Clovers to insure their success.We can get into the misbegotten idea that 'All Art is a Form of Cultural Theft', but let's leave that can of worms with the moneychangers for another day. All I know is that if so-called Whites can come to so-called Blacks for ideas about Cheer-leading techniques, rock and roll songs and inspiring jazz riffs, does the African and African American influence really end there? Or does it permeate and infuse other arenas of thought and Life as well?Here beginneth the adventure. Something for Quentin Tarantino to take note about when he is through applying the Three Laws of Fred Williamson.",Bring It On
62,dobbin-4,this movie is really stupid,5,4 July 2007,I reckon that this movie is just a pile of dribble about cheerleaders and I think that this movie is just made for the cheer leading with a tiny bit of storyline in it. There are loads of things wrong with the movie but I must say that I did laugh around 10 times which is not great but is not horrible either as I must of seen about 100 worse then movie. This movie does not deserve its rating of 59% and more like 48% because it's a bad movie but I still laughed 10 times. Overall I think this movie very ordinary and should be in a $4.00 bin at Ezy DVD let alone $15(which I've seen before) so you should only watch this movie if there is absolutely nothing else to watch and if you have an need to watch to watch a Kristen Dunst movie just watch something else.,Bring It On
63,Brogan,Huh-Huh! Huh-Huh! Cheerleaders! Huh-Huh! Huh-Huh!,8,30 August 2000,"Bring in the audience who loved that 1995 teen flick, CLUELESS, because we've got another film for those girls, and it's BRING IT ON.  But unlike CLUELESS, this film was more original, funnier, and more charming than a modern rip-off of Jane Austin's Emma. The tale of BRING IT ON has the five time champion San Diego Toro's cheerleading squad begin a new school year.  The new captain of the squad, Torrance (Kristin Dunst) is filling in some big shoes to try to get another national championship. When they look for some new recruits, only Torrance is impressed with Missy (Eliza Dushku) as the other female cheerleaders snub her thinking she's too ""trashy.""  But it's Torrance's determination that get's the former gymnastic Missy in the squad.  But there's trouble, Missy reveals to Torrance that the moves and cheers that the previous Toro's captain made were not original, they were stolen!  And they were stolen from the East Compton Clovers, led by the cold and icy Isis (Gabrielle Union). So it's up to Torrance to live up to her title and try to come up with some new dance moves that appear to be more original.  In the meantime, Torrance is getting more and more distant with her boyfriend who went off to college and is getting more attracted to Missy's brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford).  But don't worry, Missy and Torrance still remain friends. And that is what makes this movie fun, it doesn't really pull off stupid teenage cliches that one would see on either the Disney channel or early morning Saturday NBC line-up just before the Suns vs. the Lakers basketball game.  It does have some creativity in it.  I did notice some pretty darn good camera shots (and no, not just shots of the girls!) but some rather creative shots that feature the dancing and style of this movie. As I sat in the theater watching this movie (as I had a wicked smirk on my face with drool falling down from my mouth) I decided that I really enjoyed this film.  It's a nice change to see the cheerleaders try to compete in a event, and not just the lame-brained football jocks.  In fact, I enjoyed this film, A LOT more than any recent teenage football movie, where the players are treated like gods, and the cheerleaders are taunting sex objects.  No, instead in BRING IT ON, it's the football players that are dumb and the cheerleaders are a bit more smarter.  And from my high school days, that seemed more realistic, since my high school football team had a poor record. I did enjoy the acting in this film, particularly by both Kristen Dunst and Eliza Dushku.  Dunst does carry a film well (DICK is a good example of that) and she does have charm and wit added to her character.  And Dushku turns a two-dimensional character and makes her appear more real, as she has more feelings and intelligence than most of the other cheerleaders. And I would like to also mention that both ladies are very beautiful and if the sound went out while watching the movie, I would still be enjoying this film. O.K. so I give the ""Guilty Pleasure Film of 2000"" Award to BRING IT ON, but at least it's a film that I can watch with a woman and not be embarrassed, unlike SHOWGIRLS.  But after thinking about it for a while, it does manage to not go routine and typical like any other teen flick.  It's not the best teen flick, but it is better than a majority of the teen flicks out today.  So go see this film, it's a nice and happy movie for a change. **** (out of five)",Bring It On
64,TuckMN,Surprisingly good little film.,8,15 September 2000,"Before I knew anything about this movie the question presented itself to me: `How can a movie be written about such a trite subject as cheerleading?'Now the question is: `How could such a good movie be written about cheerleading?'If all you have seen is the television ads for this sweet little film you really have seen nothing about it.There is a very large cast but the characters are surprisingly well fleshed out (pun intended?).I was truly impressed and astounded by the choreography and sheer athleticism this incredible ensemble piece left me slack-jawed in amazement.Unfortunately the audience when I saw it was all young kids that not only talked throughout the entire film but also should NOT have been there because of the language and physical jokes.  This movie is probably aimed at kids -- and I know they have heard worse language -- but I wouldn't allow unsupervised children to see it.But, I liked it enough that I want to see it again; hopefully late at night on a weekday when the audience I saw it with are home in bed.I was genuinely surprised at how much I enjoyed this sweet little gem of a film.",Bring It On

The other biggest lesson of all that it teaches is that you should give everyone and anyone a chance no matter what.Spoiler WarningThe thing I find the most amazing about Torrenance is that she was not only willing to give everyone and anyone a chance, but she also encouraged Missy to join the squad. I love cheerleading and movies about it, and this is one of the best ones out there.

But I have watched this several times and I am strongly drawn to the scenes where a character mouthed a shortened version of the title of the movie ""Bring It!"" The message that comes out from that line and also permeates this movie is that champions want to beat the very best. The movie, which is about cheerleading, but also about being a champion, and it shows that two cheerleading squads are drawn to each other throughout the story, because they both know they are the best two squads around. Additionally, the movie indicates that the champions are those who let nothing stop them from winning.The ending concludes the story in a way, most people will feel good about.Also thrown into the movie, we get Eliza Dushku in a kinda good girl role and she is a cheerleader.",Bring It On
68,cofemug,Surprisingly good,8,6 September 2000,"OK, I really liked this movie.  Yes, its a juvenile movie with lots of bad jokes, but it is a movie that isn't crude and pokes fun at itself in a childish manner.  It had a dark sense of humor without being too dark.  It poked fun at its subjects without losing all respect for them.  It kind of did not know what it was at the same time that it tried to hard to be exactly what it was, and for all of these things, it was pretty funny, if you don't expect too much.The dialogue has to be some of the funniest, self-depreciating dialogue I have ever heard.  From ""My whole cheerleading life has been a lie"" to ""Don't be a cheer-tator,"" this consistently brought laughs throughout the movie. Also having some great lines was Ian Roberts, who played the drill instructor in the movie, who was Antoine from Upright Citizens Brigade.  He did not lose that edge he had on everybody else.The plot was one of those ridiculously lame plots that deserved to be skewered.  The ending was the best part of it, which I will not reveal to you.  However, if you know me and my tastes, you can probably tell what the ending is.  If you don't know the plot, you should watch the trailer.The movie is a satire of sorts that has some sort of respect for the cheerleaders, and therefore, has some slower parts, but it was generally a fast paced movie.  So, I recommend this to everybody who needs a good laugh in mainstream theaters after this lame summer.8/10",Bring It On

The little brother is very good.It's funnier than I expected, and the girls are cute. Wait for the extra scenes and out-takes during the credits.

Bring it On is one of the better teen films, mainly because of the vibrant visuals and witty script as well as the see-saw ending. In retrospect the ending had to be that way to satisfy the politically correct nature of American culture, yet I was still surprised. Dunst shines in the lead and is ably supported by many supporting actors, most notably Jesse Bradford and Eliza Dushku, who brings much-needed realty check to the cheer-leading hysteria. Despite some contrivances and stereotyping, the film doesn't really push the envelope far enough and reveals cheer-leading to be as superficial as its air-head adherents.",Bring It On
71,FrankBooth_DeLarge,Nothing more than a light comedy that is part of a cliché,6,28 January 2005,"Bring It On is pretty funny, but not hilarious. It has plenty of High School stereotypes that get pretty old. A lot of girls that I know of like this film, so I'm guessing if you're a girl with an open mind you'll like this, but there are plenty of other people I know of who think it's completely stupid.The problem with this film is that some of the characters are so ditsy and stupid that they get pretty annoying. However, there is one exceptionally funny character, he is a choreographer. He is probably the high point of the movie because he has some really funny lines and he's so crazy.Bring it on does show cheer leading from a different point of view, it shows it in a more athletic way than most other films do. Despite being rather corny, Bring It On is a feel good movie that doesn't get real boring, but for all of the guys out there, I'd recommend saving it for a night when you have to watch a movie with a girl.",Bring It On

Perhaps it would have been appropriate if the people who produced this had given a warning beforehand that there has never been anywhere such a start off like that. If people survive the opening without shocking too much from an outburst of that amount of energy they probably watch the film too.It's a sports movie about cheerleaders with Kirsten Dunst leading the charge. The other characters will not get that much spotlight as her but there will be other cool persons around too. The story will also get more serious as the movies goes on. 'Bring It On' is not actually a comedy, although it is a very funny piece anyway. It doesn't make you think about deep philosophic questions but does every movie have to? This is only about cheer leading and it's a good one about it.",Bring It On
74,Captain Ed,A movie made by committee,5,3 September 2000,"Here we have a great example of what happens when you let a committee determine how a film is to be made -- you wind up with a confused, contradictory, boring mess.Not that BIO lacked potential; it had the potential to be several different kinds of movies.  It could have been a hilarious satire on the rah-rah spirit behind the odd concept that cheerleading is a sport in itself, and there were flashes of this at times.  It could have been a serious movie about the effort and dedication it takes to become the best at something, and there were more than a few flashes of that.  It could have also been a ""Rocky"" or ""Karate Kid"" type movie where the underdog fights against all odds to come out on top, and it seems that was what the filmmakers were aiming for, but they picked the wrong characters for the leads for us to root for that.  Lastly, it could have been an excellent opportunity to show how black (and to a lesser extent, Hispanic) culture is stolen and exploited by the mainstream white culture.  They use it merely as a plot point and never explore it after that, almost exploitave itself if one thinks about it.So what we get is hints of all of these and no follow-through on any consistent theme.  The first thirty minutes of the film has several satirical gags about the cheerleaders but then insists that we take them seriously later on.  Hey, if you start off poking fun at them, we're not going to give a damn about them after that.  In fact, I spent the entire movie trying to see whether we should be rooting for the central characters or their rivals.The acting isn't bad and the cheer routines are done well.  They may be the most entertaining part of the entire movie.  There are several laughs, mostly in the first part of the movie.  After that it gets dull and plodding.  You never get to know any of the secondary characters at all, which wouldn't be a problem in a satire but is a problem when the movie starts taking itself seriously.I gave it a 5, a seriously mediocre movie, and the sad part is that it had the potential to be so much better if someone would have decided what the hell they wanted to do.",Bring It On
75,ray-280,ONE Flaw And Her Name Is...,9,14 August 2005,"GABRIELLE UNION! She was TWENTY-SEVEN when this film was released, and it showed. I suppose that since ""Grease"" was not being redone at the time, there was an overage of pushing-thirty actors in need of a high school role, but they could have cast someone younger...and more talented. Union's self-righteousness reflected a maturity well beyond the years of her character, and while this is normally impressive, that is not the case when the actress is also ""well beyond"" her character's years.Now for the good parts: the rest of the movie. Torrance Shipman is heiress apparent to the cheerleading equivalent of Duke's college basketball squad, the five-time national champions who contrast their bottom-feeding football team, that never wins a game, and only occasionally scores any points. Thanks to new arrival Missy (a gymnast, supposedly, but we never see her doing any gymnastics on stage except in the obviously spliced ""tryout"" sequence), Torrance learns that the Toros have stolen their routines from East Compton (a random two-hour drive lands them serendipitously in the Clovers' gym during a routine they stole) , whose captain, ""Isis"" (Union), has taken over her squad, apparently after being left back for 11 or so years (see age comments above).The title of the film reflects Isis's desire to beat the Toros at their best, so she tells Torrance to ""bring it."" From adversity, Torrance rises from ditzy cheerleader to soul-searching moral compass of her stereotypically vapid, upper-middle-class squad of white girls (with an Americanized Asian who is as ""white"" as the rest of the squad). Since the defending national champions get an automatic berth to the next year's finals, the stage is set for the big finish, but the Clovers need money, and the Toros need new routines, all in a few weeks. Will they get there? (Duh).The cast from this film was ""loaded"" with future A-listers Dushku (as the obviously bisexual Missy, who even gets jealous when her brother wants Torrance), Dunst (whom I can't stand but whom everyone else seems to love), Union (who recently starred in ""The Honeymooners""), and Jesse Bradford, who plays the cynical but good-natured Cliff Pantone (Missy's brother and Torrance's love interest). The choreographer ""Sparky"" (Ian Roberts) who is hired to ""save"" the school with a horrid and cloned routine that is later scrapped is great comic relief.The sexiest woman in the film, however, was Nicole Bilderback as Courtney (the Asian-American ""buffy"" with lesbian overtones). Bodies like hers belong on the A-list, and bodies like Dunst's belong on the c-list. Another reason I was endeared to Courtney is that her character didn't keep up the facade that she might actually want a nice guy for a boyfriend, which is the cheapest way to get fans in Hollywood, and a good way for borderline sexy actresses to make the A-list when they don't belong there (see Sandra Bullock, who married a biker, as another example). That she was 25 when this film was released further underscores the comparisons to ""Grease,"" however.All in all, a much better film with a much deeper message than many ""critically acclaimed"" films. I actually would have voted it Best Picture had I been given a vote. The film really is that well-done and is a must-see. The way it pokes fun at cheerleading stereotypes was pointed, tasteful, and precise.",Bring It On

It's basic plot is light and corny. The actors and actresses are all ""pretty"" people.  The script is cheesy usually, but occasionally witty and satirical.The thing about Bring it On, is that it does it all SO WELL.  All the characters are exaggerated to fit their stereotypes.  The movie never takes itself too seriously; it does try to inject drama and tension into the plot, but that tension actually has very little to do with cheerleading.Overall, the movie actually draws you in.  Most viewers probably find themselves like that one character (forget his name- brother(cliff??) of the brunette), who kept on rolling his eyes and muttering, ""But it's only cheerleading!""

This one takes the acting to the extreme parodying it to great effect. The acting is played serious and over the top. Be aware lots of fan service to start with to get the male audience to watch so far into the plot so that they won't turn off a cheerleader movie (such a dumb directing trope).

84,great_sphinx_42,Cheer-Worthy,7,7 March 2001,"Interestingly enough, one of the most tired and boring cliches in both film and high school has been the subject of two genuinely enjoyable, if fluffy, movies in less than a year. I speak of course, about cheerleaders and both 'Bring It On' and 'Sugar and Spice'. But while 'Sugar and Spice' was campy and surreal, 'Bring It On' is a self-consciously serious movie advancing the idea of the cheerleader as athlete. While this idea is an honest and accurate one, it's one that audiences will only take so far. Cheerleaders may indeed be finer athletes than those on the sports teams they cheer for- I'd believe it, although I've never been a cheerleader and only rarely watch them on ESPN. I do know, though, that 'sissy, girly' activities are very frequently more difficult than 'tough, manly' activities, but try telling the boys that- or a movie audience. No matter how many big-budget and/or 'true story' movies are made wherein football is a metaphor for life or boxing is an affirmation of the greatness of the human spirit, even the most fascinating stories about sports like gymnastics or figure skating are strictly television movie-of-the-week fodder. In this atmosphere, you cannot make a cheerleading movie serious. You have to make it a joke. The smart folks behind Bring It On, though, realized that if they could strike a certain balance they could fulfill expectations but also get their point across. So they filled their flick with cute, peppy girls like Kirsten Dunst- always a delight, and well-cast here as a golden girl with a conscience- and snappy, irreverent jokes. They have a PG-13 locker room scene and a bikini carwash. They also have broken bones and high stress- very real factors in the lives of competitive cheerleaders. The squad is co-ed, and we get to know two of these curious, maligned creatures commonly known as male cheerleaders. One of them *is* gay- and an extremely well-adjusted, likable and ""non-faggy"" one, at that. The other is straight, and as horny as any frat boy in Animal House. We also have a tough girl named Missy transferring from L.A., along with her cute brother Cliff and the news that the Toro squad's cheers are not ""100% original"", as they had believed. Unfortunately for Kirsten's character Torrance and her Rancho Carne Toros, their ex-captain stole all their prize-winning routines from an East Compton squad (which are perhaps overly rude, even given the circumstances), that will be going to Nationals for the first time. So what's a cheerleading squad to do, except experience various pratfalls on the way to coming up with their own routine and competing and learning something about valuing your own strengths? It's better than it sounds, surprisingly- and refreshingly- enough. As for macho posturing at sports movies, the fact that this was a sueprise hit and 'Sugar and Spice' was not might just be a sign that there are audiences too smart to believe that any movie about female athletes must automatically be completely silly. What a surprising- and refreshing- change.",Bring It On
85,EdYerkeRobins,"Like ""Clueless"", Only Awful",1,13 February 2001,"This is one of those odd movies that, while not taking themselves seriously enough to be a drama, just isn't funny, and thus can't be truly considered a comedy either.  The acting is for the most part believable, but there just isn't anything to the movie up until the last 10 minutes.The thing I find most curious about this movie, however, was the lack for the most part of the East Compton Clovers (the black cheerleading squad) in the movie.  While it would've been more interesting to focus on their side of the conflict, they are instead given a few scant appearances to advance the plot, as opposed to actually being part of the movie.  When they are present, all but one exhibit the tired, demeaning ""dumb ghetto girl"" persona.So, instead, the film centers on the unlikable white squad with the stolen routines and their likable leader with conscience, played by Kirsten Dunst. The leader, a senior, is worried about her team losing, since all she can do is cheerleading.  Just when the problem is introduced, however, the movie has moved on, bypassing what could've been a more interesting plot line to center more on the dull goings-on as the team scrambles to learn some new cheerleading routines, as romance brews for Dunst.With romance, conflict, and cheerleaders, this film is perfectly set up.

I enjoyed parts of the film, especially Eliza Dushku (Faith in Buffy/Angel), as she has just a wonderful and beautiful screen presence.  It wouldn't surprise me if she will become a leading actress in the future.  Kirsten Dunst is usually good, but I didn't really like her in this part, just seemed too hollow.  They say that one will understand the effort and professionalism that goes into cheerleading by watching this film, and the stereotype of them being thick as brick should be proven wrong.  Well, I'm sorry, but I was confirmed in that believe rather than anything else, as all of them, excluding Eliza's character, didn't seem to utilize their brain power to any great length, nor have any ambition or moral -> that is, not until the captain changed their mind.

The movie was a box office hit that (unfortunately) spawned two sequels that didn't live up to this gem.The Story: Torrance Shipman has just been made captain of the cheer leading squad, the Tauros. When one of the cheerleaders is injured in practice, she signs on new girl Missy, who reveals that the Tauros routines are actually stolen by the last captain (Big Red) from a poor & down trod squad, the Clovers. Torrance thinks that it's all a curse from accidentally on purpose dropping the Spirit Stick on a cheer camp when Big Red dared her to do so. Things just keep getting worse for Torrance after the squad becomes the laughing stock of the cheer leading world when they hire a psycho choreographer who taught other squads the exact same dance to the exact same song. Now Torrance has to whip up a new and original dance in just a few weeks for a national competition to claim the victory that the Tauros won by stolen routines.A great movie. Highly recommended.",Bring It On

Blame it on the bad scripts and bad directing!And I don't know why they even bother to get Jesse Bradford to play a forgettable role. It's a waste of his talent!The competition itself is not as grand as I expected it to be. Basically, the whole movie just fell flat on my face.

It had some good stars like Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman, Spiderman 2) and Eliza Dushku (True lies). This was about a team of cheerleaders from a predominately white school taking on a rival predominately black school. I actually wanted to go out and get this movie for the sole fact that I hadn't seen it yet. Maybe I have been under a rock or something. I don't know! In the end, you wouldn't think it was going to end the way it did. You would have thought that the team led by captain Kirsten would have won the National Championship. Wasn't so. The other rival team with less money and more moves won the competition.I liked the fact that it was supposed to be set in Daytona, Fl. and there was one scene where the sun was setting. It should have been setting behind the buildings and not over the ocean! If you like cheer-leading, this is one movie you can appreciate!",Bring It On

I saw it when it first came out in 2000. I really like cheer leading but I myself am not a cheerleader. i am more of a punk/skater chick. But I love it. It has great energy and I liked how they portrayed cheerleaders, it was very realistic. Some of my friends are cheerleaders and I know what they are like. Just like they say in this film, cheerleaders are athletes. Not air heads. I hate how in all these shows and movies they show cheerleaders as the following; dumb, mean, rude, popular, idiotic, totally ditz. That's not what this is. I liked Missy. She was more of a motorcycle chick/tomboy before she was convinced by Torrance to join the Toros. I like that she became more confident and more feminine after wards but still kept her sassy attitude. I also liked Torrance. Instead of her being a mean captain, she was sweet and nice to everyone. I really liked Isis and Jenelope too. Isis had a great attitude and was a strong leader. Jenelope was just really funny. Great attitude. This movie didn't use corny humor. This movie was realistically funny and well acted. The cheer routines were also very good. The music, the gymnastics, the dance, etc. They weren't those silly routines you see in movies. They were athletic and really cool! I would say my favorite routine was the Clover's routine at both regionals and at the finals. They were really interesting routines. But the Toros rocked too. The great actresses made the movie. Kirsten was sweet, Eliza showed a lot of emotion, and Gabriella is just the perfect part for Isis; pretty, athletic, great actress, perfect! This movie had a great script and great cheer leading. Watch it! Boys like it too. My friend, Tim thinks this movie is hilarious! Watch it, all genders. Really realistic film.",Bring It On

I was expecting a bunch of spoiled high school girls who where too worried about breaking a nail and making sure they look cool in front of their friends and boys friends.  I really never had any intention of watching this film but my oldest son brought it home so we sat down to watch it.  I was pleasantly surprised by it.  It was actually a pretty serious film about the life of cheer leading squads that compete.I remember watching some of these squads on TV when I was in high school and I have to admit they really do take their sport seriously.  I feel this movie does do the sport some justice.  I know this movie is a comedy and it is a funny movie in many respects.  Some of the jokes are really good and you will get a good laugh out of this one.  However, if you look under the gags and jokes, you will see there is a very serious side to this movie.  A side which shows there is more to cheering than just getting your teams fan's fired up.  There are some cheer leading squads that are very serious about what they do and are intent on bring home the gold in competition.
""Bring it On"" though a good comedy, shows this well.  This one is worth your while (7 out of 10).",Bring It On

95,JamesMitchell451,Surprisingly good,7,22 September 2013,"Dance films fall into two categories: God-Awful and Good. This one is thankfully the latter. The films main character Torrance Shipmun (Kristen Dunst) is a cheerleader who discovers that her cheerleading captain stole all the dance routines that made their team so good from another team. Now, Torrance must prove their team's worth in a competition. The only problem I can really say that I have with the film is that the plot is a sort of ""has been there done that"" affair, but the characters are still likable and believable. One of the best things about this film is the humor, it really isn't a cheerleading film but more of a spoof of cheerleading films, and it works really well. It addresses what I've always thought: That if you are a guy, you will think that cheerleading is stupid. The film admits some of the stupid aspects of the ""sport"" and uses it to great effect; the jokes are really funny and put a really big smile on my face. Never once did I ever feel bored, I was always entertained. The acting is good, but the real star is the dances, which look spectacular and are incredibly fun to watch as well. Hell, this whole film is plain fun, guys on dates will think its fun, and girls will be having a blast with this.

96,Time Tripper,Funny eye candy.,6,25 August 2000,"""Bring It On"" is the kind of movie where you walk into the theater knowing about everything that's going to happen.  It is a very unoriginal film.  I still managed to turn off my brain and enjoy it for the following reasons: (1) Kirsten Dunst is a good actress, and she's also very cute. (Unfortunately, she keeps finding herself in movies that don't show off the full range of her talents.  This is one of them.) (2) Eliza Dushku is also good in this, although she's basically playing the same character she always plays. (3) It's funny!  There's some really amusing moments and dialogue in this movie.  Which is a plus, since (as many of the people who've reviewed this film seem to have forgotten) IT'S A COMEDY. (There's some PG-13-worthy jokes, but nothing too bad.) (4) Good choreography.  I liked watching the dance numbers. (5) Eye candy...'nuff said. Sure this movie has all the common elements, such as the goofy romance, the moral lesson, the stereotypical characters, but it still works.  Both the opening scene and the credit cookies (a combination of dancing and outtakes) are particularly hilarious. (Although, I will agree any comparison to ""Rocky"" is a mistake.)",Bring It On
97,Extraordinary_Machine,"'Bring It On' is perhaps the first major motion picture to showcase the various intricacies of the sport of cheerleading, and on that level it succeeds masterfully...",7,6 March 2005,"Bring It On High school student Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst) is lamenting her boyfriend Aaron's (Richard Hillman, 'Boys and Girls') departure for college, but she also has something to celebrate. She's just been picked to fill the position of the captain of the school's award-winning cheerleading squad, a duty the teenager takes very seriously. When one of the cheerleaders is injured during a practice, Torrance holds auditions for a replacement, and reluctantly decides to recruit the spunky new girl, Missy (Eliza Dushku, ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""), who reveals to Torrance that their entire act has been stolen from another school's. With just weeks until the regional championships, the team (including Clare Kramer and Nicole Bilderback) must scramble to come up with a completely new routine to avoid complete humiliation, while Torrance has to deal with a sudden crush on Missy's brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford, 'Hackers').Cheerleaders are usually left with the short straw in teen movies. They're usually portrayed as heartless vamps or stuck-up ditzes, and, rather surprisingly, rarely do we actually see them cheerleading. 'Bring It On' is perhaps the first major motion picture to showcase the various intricacies of the sport, and on that level it succeeds masterfully. There's nothing new about the rest of the film, though.Director Peyton Reed is certainly in his element with this lively comedy. A former music video director who has been honing his skills on the small screen (including remakes of Disney films 'The Love Bug' and 'The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes'), Reed has found the perfect project for which to mark his feature film debut. Reed is working from a serviceable script by Jessica Bendiger (also debuting here), who sees cheerleading as an art form, and the filmmaker treats it as such.~ 7/10 ~",Bring It On
98,Euphorbia,"Funny, lewd, sexy, energetic, witty, and moral.",9,25 November 2002,"In short, everything I want in an entertaining movie. I had read enough good things about this movie to give it a try. I figured that at least it should have a few chuckles, a few good-looking cheerleaders. I sat back in my chair, half closed my eyes, and said, ""Okay Mr. Peyton Reed, keep me awake if you can."" Well, about two lines into the opening ""cheer"" (see the IMDB quotes page) I sat up straight, all eyes and ears. And my attention never wavered, my eyelids never drooped, right through the closing credits. Even the best movies usually have a few dead spots (""narrative bridges""), but this one has none, and I watched it three times in a row (the second time listening to the director's commentary, in which he points out several places where he nearly went astray, and explains why he didn't). This is simply a brilliant movie, where everyone involved got everything right. It cuts no slack for the lazy, the stupid, the cynical, or the corrupt -- either on screen or in the audience. No, it is not a documentary. It does not depict cheerleading, or high school, or teenagers as they really are. That would be a very different movie, and not nearly as much fun as this. Instead it is a surreal teen comedy, in the vein of American Beauty, but a far superior movie to that morbidly perverse piece of work -- more engaging, more entertaining (with great production numbers), and more hopeful in its view of people, and of the world. Pretty amazing for a first feature film -- indeed for any film. 9.4/10",Bring It On

And then there is another scene where the two of them sleep in the same bed, which is the scene where many people began to think that they are lesbian lovers.Anyway, the film however surprised me because it actually turned out to be a cute film. The cheerleading practice scenes were very funny and the actual competition was exciting and hip.

102,MeloDee,Did I waste 2 hours of my life?,6,30 May 2007,"That's what this movie had me thinking at the end of it. This, even with the ending credits actually being one of this movie's best parts. It featured the cast of the movie lipsynching and dancing to the song ""Hey Mickey."" Bring it On could be a real pain in some points. The combined crudeness and general long length it seemed to take for the movie to reach its climax made it a bit difficult to watch.The movie finally gets a move on it, when Torrance, shortly after becoming squad captain, discovers that the former Torros captain had been stealing the cheerleading routines of a squad from another school- the Clovers. Torrance then, overcome with guilt and shame, takes it upon herself to create a fresh routine for the team before the finals that are only a few weeks away. Torrance attributes much of her problems to ""the curse."" The Curse was the hilarious myth that Torrance picked up at cheer camp, that claimed that dropping the ""spirit stick"" caused bad fortune to follow you for the rest of your life.The movie definitely has its quite humorous moments. The more shallow characters are clearly parodies- in fact, most of the film is indeed a parody. The movie in some ways teaches a lesson by mocking those who are proud of themselves for cheating to win.My favorite characters were as follows- Torrance Shipman, (Kirsten Dunst) president of the Torros squad; Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku), Torrance's closest friend and ""ally"" on the squad; Cliff Pantone (Jesse Bradford), Missy's electric-guitar-playing, constantly-CD-player-wearing, cheerleader-hating brother and Torrance's romantic fixation throughout the greater part of the film. I think, they in many ways save the movie by bringing it a little more down to earth.The acting in the movie was as good as was to be desired considered the circumstances. In fact, I didn't think that it was that bad.As for the cheer routines? Colorful, brilliant, and all around excellent for lack of more creative wording.Despite that, if I had one word to summarize my opinion on the movie it would be; subpar. Though, perhaps we ought to cut it some slack. After all, it WAS a ""teenage"" movie. How many of those are actually really good? Did I waste 2 hours of my life? Maybe.

103,cglassey,Cheers for the film that walks a fine line,8,21 May 2001,"This film is actually quite good and well worth the time to watch it. The idea was originally a documentary but with no takers, the writer turned it into a drama and I think the result is more than one could have hoped.The girls are cute and all but there is a lot of skill and talent involved in their ""cheer routines"" and the movie doesn't down-play their work nor make it super serious. For me, the best parts of the film show the relations between the really talented but poor cheer squad from East Compton LA and the much richer and more famous squad from San Diego. The idea of popular culture stealing from black culture was handled well in the context of these cheer routines. There is a lot of truth to the ""stealing"" charge and the movie doesn't get angry but, in an amazing movie moment, the white heroine's squad loses to the slightly more talented black squad. I found it very refreshing and very ""un-American"" (or at least, un-Hollywood).The second best sequence in the film is when the San Diego squad hires a choreographer to teach them a new cheer routine. This ""Bob Fosse"" wanna-be is a truely funny ""angry actor"" and his routine is bad and he insults the cheer-girls, its just really, really funny.Great acting, great cheer routines, very intelligent. The film is really only marred by the fact that cheerleading isn't that important. This is not a film about earth shaking topics with tragic actors and huge emotions. Think of this instead as a delicious desert, it tastes great and its made with quality ingredients.",Bring It On

Revolving around a growing rivalry between an all-white cheerleading squad from a San Diego suburb and an all-black inner-city squad (apparently before desegregation and school busing programs were introduced?), this film makes cheerleaders, and their sport, look dumber than deserved.  Dunst gives an energetic and hard-working performance as the head cheerleader for the all-white squad, and her battle with the ethics of cheerleading is about the only thing that rings true.  The all-black squad (led by Gabrielle Union, who makes the most of a tough situation) is given a fraction of the screen time, reflecting the view in Hollywood that white people are simply more interesting and more deserving to be the focus of most major commercial films.

Gone are the days of TnA movies like Porky's, Revenge of the Nerds, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Seeing teen movies is tolerable that if they're not great, you get a little bit of nudity, and you pass the time that much easier.

Even though there are depictions of certain ""darker"" elements of our society such as fraud, deception and jealously in this movie, however much there can be in relation to a cheer-leading contest, the incredibly overbearing tone of hope, joyfulness and light-hearted trust - both in friends and romantic interests - dwarfs this. As a result the movie lacks any true cynicism and hint of despair and it's fantastic for it. In my opinion, usually feel good movies of a certain kind do feel more sinister than good, quite oblivious to how the blatant exposure to the exaggerated happiness of the characters and events unfolding make them hard to watch without getting suspicious of a fictitious, evil subplot that they are keeping from us. This movie just felt right. Characters were often silly, needlessly ambitious, and generally flawed in many ways but they felt sincere, believable and most importantly likable. They felt genuinely like high-school kids, kids who were probably smart enough to appreciate and enjoy their youth (unconsciously as with most people that age), yet not damaged by time and experience to waste their days on earth as cynical creatures.

The stereotypical school from Compton was also very enjoyable for obvious reasons.  If you do rent the film on DVD be sure to watch the deleted scenes.  There is one scene about colleges for Ms. Dunst.  her mom argues for her attend schools that are obviously far superior to her intellect such as Pomona, which the mom talks up for a good period of time.  Spencer found this especially amusing since he attended the school.  My sister also currently attends the school, however, she is not important right now.  The third and final time I saw this movie was at Dallas' house with Dallas and Chuck.  We spent most of the movie debating who we wanted to bone.  I liked Dushku, Chuck the head cheerleader from east Compton High and I don't remember what Dallas said, but for arguments sake let's say it was Dunst.  We then went to the OL for some beers.  That was fun too.  So in conclusion I recommend watching the movie at Dallas' house and then hitting the OL for some post film brew-ha-ha's.",Bring It On

Taking as it does the cutthroat world of cheer-leading in the US, it wrenches a tale so shatteringly shocking from this backdrop that you are left breathless and reeling from the sheer tour-de-force of passion, betrayal, lust and, yes, humour.My first watching left me reeling with its heady brew of excitement, salacious internal fury and brilliantly twisting turning tale. Nothing, but nothing, will prepare you for this film. You will need to watch it over and over again just to absorb the gut-level blows the script delivers; then you will view it some more to start picking up on the subtle nuances and almost unnoticeable directorial touches that serve to keep you engaged and flummoxed at an almost subliminal level.The Buffy alumni of Kramer and Dushku are worth the price of the DVD Special Edition alone but mix into this the (still, my beating heart)almost perfect Dunst, Union and Bell and frankly, you have a phalanx of unbearable beauty, talent and teasing Lolita-esqe innuendo.I am not worthy to explain the plot - I simply could not do it justice. But, please, I implore you, watch this film and then vote for it with Ten Stars. The only shame is that the stars dial don't go up to eleven like the buttons on a Spinal Tap amp.Submit to the avuncular charm of Sparky Polastri and thank the Lord for Peyton Reed.Not bettered until Legally Blonde....finally, for those reviewers on here that recommend that those involved with this film f*ck off and die - well, really, get a life, an intellect, a sense of humour and proportion; and learn to spend your time more productively.

When one convinced me to watch it with her I was wondering what I had gotten myself into. Well here is the truth about this so-called ""classic""...it is definitely worth watching, especially for other straight males. Here's why:1) Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku. An entire sub-plot in the movie seemd to be a battle to determine which one was hotter. It was very difficult. In the end I had to award both of them for ""bringing it on.""2) Girls who watch this get really...""inspired""  by this movie.

But this teen movie is a parody unto itself, and it pulls it off wonderfully. Kirsten Dunst is perfect as the bubbly head cheerleader, Eliza Dushku is great as the cheerleader with an attitude, and Jesse Bradford, as Cliff, is a refreshing change from the usually vapid male lead.

At the end of the day it's not meant to teach an important lesson. It's for entertainment - which it does not fail to do. The one thing in this movie that's original is the dance routines. They look so fun and hype you up. It's not slow, boring or over clichéd. It's actually a very good movie and enjoyable to watch over and over again.It is a story about two cheerleading groups both challenging each other and many other groups to win the national cheerleading championship.

Bring it on is a movie about two groups of Cheerleaders who have a battle on the stage to see who is the best. One group are the rich suburban white group, and the other are a poorer street wise black group, but this is not a movie about race, it's a movie about Cheerleaders and teens in general. I left the movie with a feeling of excitement and energy. Seeing the way the two groups performed (both female and male Cheerleaders) with all the energy gave you the same thoughts as Charlies Angels did, that you can go out there and do anything you want. Being A teenager myself I saw people my age in relationships problems but also doing what they love to do with skill and grace. This movie can be seen by a whole range of viewers of all ages, it's fun for everyone. Some people may think it's a Cheerleader Spoof story, it's all been done but this movie is the opposite of that. It shows for the first time how hard the cheerleaders work, and how it actually is a sport.Kirstin Dunst, Eliza Dushku, Riley Smith and the other actors actually learnt how to do the routines, it isn't a shot of them with a smile and then cut to an obvious fill in who does all the hard athletic moves.If you like movies that pick you up, give you a smile and make you think ""Gee, I want to do what they are doing.""

141,EmAn1213,I just don't get it,1,28 January 2002,"""Is this movie for real?!"" That's all I could think the first time I saw this film. The story follows the Rancho Carne Toros cheerleading team and their captain Torrance (Kirstin Dunst) as they make their way through the tumultuous world of cheerleading. The Toros are champion cheerleaders, but soon after being named captain, Torrance discovers that their team has actually been stealing cheers from a poor, inner-city school. Poor ""Tor"" is torn. She wants her team to win, but will she be able to do it without cheating? The plot isn't a bad idea, really. It's just your basic sports movie (although there is debate about whether cheering is a sport.) However, the aspect that really brings the movie down is the seriousness that is laid on extra thick in nearly every scene. For example, when trying to convince a skeptical newcomer to join the team, Torrance says with a cheesy grin, ""We work hard, we have fun, and we win national championships."" She sounds like an infomercial for the Wonderful World of Cheering. To make matters even more confusing, the ultra-seriousness is alternated with jokes and situations that blatantly make fun of cheering and reinforce the blond, bimbo cheerleader stereotype. I really can't figure out if they're trying to make cheerleading the hero or the butt of the jokes. Plus, Kirstin Dunst was so annoying as the self-centered, cheering obsessed, PMSing Torrance that I really don't think I'll voluntarily see another one of her movies for quite some time.",Bring It On

They play quite heavily on the stereotypes in the beginning and don't really try hard enough to make up for it at the end, I don't consider the cheerleaders to be serious athletes, so that's one mark against the film. As a whole, the film was semi-entertaining. It was a nice comedy that had a decent plot. Kirsten Dunst played a strong lead and most of the supporting cast were OK. Though 2 of the main cheerleaders (the blonde and the Asian, names escape me) were downright annoying. Too sum up, a nice movie that had too many stereotypes for my tastes, worth a look if you're interested in any way with Cheerleaders.

145,hireswell,THE MOST DEPRESSING MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!,1,29 August 2000,"Seeing ""Bring It On"" was more painful than having my wisdom teeth removed!! How this film made 17 million dollars in one weekend is even more beguiling. Is this what teenagers today relate to or were there just a lot of dirty old men who wanted to be teased by scantily clad adolescents? This film wants to be R rated but stay safely in the PG-13 zone, so what we get are ugly camera shots that are positioned just above the frontal nudity format.
The plot: A 5 time national champion cheerleading squad has to redeem itself after it is discovered that their award winning routine has been stolen from a much more talented inner city cheerleading squad. It's supposed to be a comedy but the only thing that made me laugh was the fact that this film was made. The young characters are so absorbed in cheerleading that you wonder how they plan to make a living after they graduate from high school: they barely acknowledge the fact that they have classes to go to. None of them seem to have any genuine emotions and all of them are downright annoying. If these kids were in ""Friday the 13th"" people just might cheer for Jason.	 As I was watching it I began to realize that each scene was getting worse and worse. Some examples. The laborious scene where the cheerleaders audition a new member for their squad: the captain insists on the weird girl while the other cheerleaders complain saying the process is supposed to be a democracy, their corrected and told it's a ""cheerocracy"". Then the captain is later referred to as a ""cheertator"". There is also the scene where a choreographer, who is recycled out of every dance movie ever made, trains the girls. Amongst other things he tells one girl to starve herself to get thin; that's just a wonderful idea to put into a teenage girl's head. Then there are the scenes with the inner city cheerleading squad that so tirelessly stereotype African American speech and manner that I was amazed that this film was released in the year 2000 and not 1950.	 What's depressing is that as this movie played I actually heard young people laughing. This is humorous to them? Then I came to the conclusion that as long as they keep going to movies like this we'll keep getting movie like this. Perhaps one day there will actually be a film that shows what it's truly like to be a teenager and it might even star actors who aren't in their thirty's.

Unfortunately everything begins to go downhill. After her boyfriend goes off to college, he rarely talks to her. Her squad begins to turn on her after she puts the new rebellious girl on the team. If that wasn't enough, she discovers that the previous captain of the squad had stolen all of their routines from an inner-city high school. With both teams going to regionals, what is Torrence to do? What really makes this film is the routines, the performances, and the chemistry between the four main actors - without all of the above, I don't think this film would have been the hit that it was. It has all the makings of a teen movie - attractive, well-known and loved actors, a likable heroine, a jerk boyfriend, a sweet guy who would be perfect for said heroine, drama between said heroine and those around her, and her finding out who her true friends are. Yet, this film manages to pull it all together with good humor and no nudity. Dunst and Bradford have so much chemistry they can make brushing teeth flirtatious. Dushku put in a great performance as the rebellious rocker chick Missy, and Union pulled off her role as the tough yet classy captain of the rival squad with ease.Overall: A run-of-the-mill teen flick spiced up with believable performances, likable characters, great chemistry between the actors, and fun routines that the audience can get into.

Bring It On Again I have to admit was pathetic. That entry into the franchise has been scrubbed off my list of favourites, but I find Bring It On All or Nothing and Bring It on In it To Win It to be the best entry's in the series. Bring It On may be classed as successful as it is probably one of the first movies aimed at ""teenagers"" about how competitive some people can be and how a ""high-school"" experience is like. THE MAIN POINTS ..1)ACTING: The film made a right move in casting a well known Hollywood name, Kirsten Dunst as the lead role and this added to the success of the film. Me, in my opinion, doesn't see Kirsten Dunst as a great actress? But she definitely helped the films popularity. The rest of the acting is great. The ""bitch"" - - GABRIELLE UNION does is well and all give quite a believable performance.2)STORY: The story is unique, but now, 9 years after it was made, the story has been re-shaped into tons of other films and the story is now old. Original for it's time.3)CHEERING: The cheer-leading in this film is fine.

I know this doesn't sound like the most original and complicated plot, but what do you want from a movie like this. Kirsten Dunst looks fabulous and so do all the other cheerleaders.

How was a movie about cheerleading (you know, that 'phenomenon' solely related to North American high schools) going to have appeal outside of North America, let alone outside the 12-17 year old demographic it was targeted at?  By using a surprisingly cluey screenplay by Jessica Bendinger, snappy dialogue, an effervescent cast (in particular, Kirsten Dunst (Torrance Shipman), Eliza Dushku (Missy), Jesse Bradford (Cliff) & Gabrielle Union (Isis)) and some absolutely awesome choreography.

Which is just as well, because otherwise you'd have a hard time putting up with the rest that appears on screen.The cheerleading sequences are quite impressive - it's a bit of a pity the remainder of the film isn't quite up to the same calibre.  Don't get me wrong - it's fun, but you can't help wishing for something more.  The characters speak like they're showing off to the camera, instead of just speaking like any normal teenager would, which gets annoying rather quickly. Also the attempts to try and give cheerleading a send up with the cheerleaders complaing that Torrance is running a 'cheerocracy' and is being a 'cheertator', and later on that she's having 'cheersex' with a guy in the audience fails to find many laughs at all.Anyway, the cheerleading sequences are tops (as mentioned above).  Dunst looks nice and cute as Torrance, but her character suffers from all the usual gimmicks and cliches that are seen in countless other teenage films (usually related to what is known as 'idiot plot' syndrome).  The real standouts are Eliza Dushku and Gabrielle Union, who at times bring an air of reality to their characters - Dushku being the rebel who wonders what all the fuss is about, and Union the captain who just wants to give her team the best chance she can give it.  It probably helps that they're supporting characters as well, meaning they don't have to be on the screen as much as Dunst (who at times struggles to keep her character afloat).All up, 'Bring It On' is an enjoyable romp, but I think a viewer would get the most out of it if they happen to be a fan of any of the leading actors mentioned above.  Otherwise it's yet another teenage/sports film with a twist (and some pretty good cheerleading sequences).3.5 out of 5",Bring It On
156,iamalwayslovingyou,Soo Funny!!!,8,26 August 2000,"I just watched this movie yesterday at the movies. This movie is a really good movie. It is soo funny. One of my favorite actresses- Eliza Dushku. It all starts when Missy(Dushku) comes to town and joins the cheerleading squad called Toros. When Missy takes Torrence (Dunst) another cheerleading squad in L.A., she realizes the horrible truth. Darcy, the former leader of the squad had always stole their moves. All the years that they had won, it had been because they cheated. Torrence wants to actually win this time without cheating. She also falls in love with Cliff, Missy's brother. Torrence even brakes up with her boyfriend- who doesn't believe in her and cheats on her. But before she brakes up, Cliff sees her kissing him. What will happen? Will Cliff and Dunst get to go out? Will they win for cheerleading? Find out in this funny movie. It teaches you that cheating is bad and that you don't always have to be perfect, as long as you're good. I think you should see this movie. It's really good.",Bring It On
157,EuroMaverick,Could have been much worse...,5,9 December 2002,"Well, this is your typical teen-movie, as predictable as they can get (with one exception near the end), but it could have been much worse.Light and relatively fun movie, with average humor and some pretty impressive dancing.

158,wbg02,Dunst & Dushku in a fun movie,7,6 September 2003,"There are two ways a viewer can appreciate this movie.  First, you can  like it as an enjoyable, energetic teen movie that pokes fun at the earnestness of high school cheerleaders and cheerleading competition.  Yet, it doesn't cross the line into cynicism, since even the characters critical of these peppy but serious cheerleaders get with the program by the end.  The other major attraction, of course, is the eye candy.  The viewer gets over 90 minutes of Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku in cheerleader outfits. (There's even a bikini/car wash scene.)  All pitch in to make the movie fun.  The writers maintain the lighthearted balance throughout.  The director keeps the plot moving quickly, and the cast seems to be enjoying themselves.  All this encourages the viewer to go along with the ride.",Bring It On
159,Opus-16,good satire,7,20 September 2000,"I went to this movie not because I was really interested, but because my wife went to high school with Tsianina Joelson and she wanted to check out her work.  That being said, I was pleasently surprised.  I was expecting fluff from what I knew going in, but from the wicked opening sequence I realized it was going to have some sharp, barbed satire as well.  When I think about it, I should have known, since Kirsten Dunst usually does more sharp edged type movies.  My only complaint is that the movie was a little schizophrenic.  It seemed  strange to mix the over the top satire of the opening scene and others with a fairly conventional and politically correct plot.  Overall the acting was very good and fit the mood of the film, though it was obvious the actors were not high-schoolers anymore.  My vote was a 7.",Bring It On

The movie quickly goes downhill after the opening cheer sequence.  In the first 15 minutes you know who the winning squad is, so rest of it is a bunch of whining and in-fighting among the vapid blondes.

Years later I rewatched it and realised, it was a quite poor movie.The storyline itself is quite good but the script and acting felt fake. It was as if the script writers were trying very hard to emulate a teen society and at many points the characters were too exaggerated in the attempt to be a 'real teen'.All right, it wasn't all that bad but with all the unnecessary swearing and the main character falling for the love interest based on nothing but a few smirks and flirty exchanges overall destroyed the entire movie.The majority of this movie felt bland and fake. The only part that was REALLY worth watching were the cheerleading performances at the end of the movie. But the rest? Bleurgh.

So rent this if u want to feel happier,need a good laugh and generally want to watch a decent teen flick.(oh and the dancing really good too and i generally don't like watching cheerleading, so if i like it then every girl no matter how tomboyish u think u r will like it too) P.S listen to the lyrics they're seriously funny!",Bring It On

It's perky, energetic and cute, but also realistic, fun and romantic.It's not a ""Chick Flick"" really, because I know a fair share of blokes who brought this film to ogle at cheerleaders hehe. I brought the film 'cos I'm a Kirsten Dunst fan, and she does not fail to brighten up the screen.Now, this is a ""sports movie"" without a doubt. It's rocky in a sports bra. Normally, I shy away from films like this because they're overly predictable, but this movie didn't angle around the competition, it angled around the people competing in it.The acting was fantastic and so was the music!

I bought a used VHS copy at Blockbuster, but having become accustomed to DVDs (I'd only bought a few movies on VHS and now have around 30 DVDs) I just had to get this one DVD. I'm glad I did, because of the deleted scenes, many of which are pretty fun. I went to see it, having only heard a few reviews ahead of time. I'd never been a cheerleader, though I tried out once. Nevertheless the plot was great and bizarre. I mean, how many people actually get angry over stealing others' cheers? Seeing such things on national TV is probably where people come up with ideas. Just the same I still love watching this film. It is worth owning and seeing over and over.",Bring It On

I felt like I was back in high school, with the full variety of personalities, none of them underdeveloped or overwritten: the script was sharp and well thought out.What really made it great, however, was that it didn't take itself too seriously, but it didn't take itself too lightly either.The folks who put this together get extra respect for doing all this; for making a real film; on a topic that I would never have considered possible to do so.Bring it on!",Bring It On

They haven't had any new idea to deal with.
This film is also made for boys and the audience that usually goes to see this sort of movies are girls. Too many scenes with girls in bikini and underwear and there's a lack of boys bodies, c'mon, they don't even take their shirts off and that's kinda unfair.Anyway I gotta say that the soundtrack is very good, lot of songs to dance and the cheerleading choreography is amazing, these two things rock.",Bring It On

I was really impressed with the (no doubt real) cheerleaders and their skills. The story itself was ok. It wasn't great, but it was passable. Seriously, the only reason I gave it a 5 was for the acting of Eliza Dushku and Gabrielle Union as well as the ladies from Blaque. They were the real stars. Them and the choreographers.",Bring It On
172,rafajs77,What most people don't understand,10,3 June 2006,"I tend to eschew frivolous films, and because of this I have had to defend my appreciation of this movie. People find confusing that the movie shows both self-absorbed cheerleaders who believe the endeavor to be worthwhile and meaningful, and at the same time cheerleading's detractors. Also confusing is how a cheerleading squad could function without a faculty coach. The reason this is peripheral to the film is that the film is about fair play and sportsmanship, and it succeeds in conveying that message.The dialogue is funny and approaches wit several times. My favorite line in the movie is delivered by Courtney (Clare Kramer): ""I don't mean to be predictable, but I don't give a sh!%!"" Perfect! The acting is pretty solid, what seems like overacting to some is simply part of the satire that the movie is. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",Bring It On
173,CaterpillarEffect,Not bad at all,6,27 September 2009,"According to me, this is an underrated teen comedy. Not many people I know have actually seen this, but I think it should get more credit for what it is.Lighten up. It's supposed to be stupid, predictable, cheesy and whatever else. A story about cheerleaders. Doesn't sound too interesting, because seriously-the only plot this film can have is a very cliché, predictable one. Exactly what I pointed out above. And it is true, the script isn't Oscar-worthy, but it has been turned into a film rather well.The characters are stereotypical, which is stereotypical for teen comedies-we have the nice cheerleader, the bitchy cheerleaders, the gay male cheerleader, the cocky football players, the unfaithful boyfriendyou know the deal. Then we have the two new characters-Cliff and Missy Pantone. Cliff is very much into punk music and sneakers. Missy is an individual, tough chick who used to do gymnastics. They both see cheerleaders as stuck up and shallow. Missy ends up on the squad after shoeing off her skills at the try outs, and Cliff becomes our new love interest, resulting in out main character, newly elected team captain, Torrance Shipman being torn between her boyfriend and the new guy. Then we find out that the cheer team's award-winning routines were actually stolen from a different team. Oh no! Now Torrance, with the help of Missy, has to save her squad's honor and lead them to victory at the cheer contests.The film begins with a cheer routine, with a song so catchy it will stick in your head for a while. The highlight of the film has to be the Sparky Polastri intro. But I won't ruin it for you. I enjoyed watching the cheer routines, this was the first film I had ever seen that actually concentrated on cheerleading, so it was quite interesting to see how the whole 'cheer-business' would be shown. It contained some good-tasted laughs and you could identify yourself with some of the characters, even if you found them slightly annoying in some moments.Your cliché-alert will go off straight after Torrance gets chosen captain, and has to organise try-outs because a member of the squad falls off the top of the pyramid. It won't stop until the end of the film. Yes, the story is predictable. But it's a teen comedy-it has to be!",Bring It On

In the offending scene, a dance instructor proceeds to tell the girls that they ought to skip a few meals so that their bodies will consume fat and perhaps decrease the size of a few rear ends.  Now while the writers might have thought this would bring on chuckles and giggles, and the directors might have passed over this material without a second thought, it is not at all something that ought to be fed into the minds of young American girls. Young teens are already depressed enough with their bodies after reading Teen Magazine and Seventeen and YM, and seeing every model and actress on television with a ""perfect body.""

I enjoyed watching the cheer leading squads doing their thing and different styles at work, conventional Vs mainstream Vs hip-hop and the love story was stupid but a bit sugary-sweet. Kirsten Dunst does a good job acting but she was more impressive watching her... um, stretch her acting talents to that of a ditzy blonde cheer lead... oh, sorry I was distracted by Eliza Dushku. I had forgotten how pretty she is and almost wrote something stupid.Many of the jokes fall flat as did the fact that the cheer leading squad may be better than the football team fell into the ""interesting to know but I don't really care"" category.

184,TIDQ,(Minor spoilers perhaps) A rousing tale of Kirsten Dunst's quest to wear many skimpy outfits,2,8 September 2004,"I recently have had the fortunate (unfortunate?) opportunity of watching the full, uncut version of ""Bring It On"" on my dorm's free movie channel. For some reason, I must have blocked out any evidence of this movie's existence from my mind as soon as I heard of it four years ago. I say this because as I cannot remember this major movie's release at all.It might as well have stayed that way, because this is a horrible movie. One might look at a trailer for a cheerleader movie and go, ""What a boring concept. This is probably going to be a boring, flat movie."" Well, that person would be completely correct.To sum up the plot of ""Bring It On,"" I would have to say there isn't much of one. The primary story revolves around a cheer competition, and apparently the cheer team's old leader stole all of their routines from an inner city school. This means they have to come up with a new routine from scratch with the competition right around the corner, or suffer humiliation.As gripping as that sounds, it's pretty hard to feel compassion for the protagonists. There isn't anything riding on the idea that ""they must win,"" and the characters seem cliché at best. Kirsten Dunst plays the new head cheerleader with a strong sense of justice, Eliza Dushku is the new recruit ""bad girl,"" and the rest have typical valley girl accents and attitudes. The friction between Eliza and the rest of the girls seems to disappear quickly into the movie for no reason, and after that, the whole team is pretty uniformly uninteresting.The worst part of the movie would have to be the ""rival"" cheer team that they had stolen all their dance routines from. I am shamed at the women who played those roles, because they've set back minorities 30 years at least. The wise-talking, street-fighting, finger-snapping group of African Americans and other minorities are a walking satire of hip-hop culture.The biggest surprise of the movie is when I found out that it's a comedy. The reason that's a surprise is because it's not funny. There are a few cute moments, but I wouldn't say there were any guffaw-worthy scenes. A few jokes I concede that I enjoyed. ""Those aren't spirit fingers. THESE are spirit fingers.""There is a bright side to this movie, though shallow it very much is. In every single scene, they somehow manage to get Kirsten Dunst in very telling and alluring outfits. They somehow manage to accentuate her breasts in every part of the movie without having to show cleavage most of the time. That being said, the highlight of the movie for me was the carwash scene where Eliza and Kirsten both were covered in soap-lather while wearing small bikinis. Honestly, moments like that were the only thing that kept me awake through the movie.",Bring It On
185,Lord Trephine,A Pleasing Good Time,10,9 January 2002,"Bring it on was by far one of the best teen comedies that has ever came to the big screen and we rarely get a good decent comedy in this genre that is funny with a good story and highly entertaining. The actors were great and best of all the dance sequence were the highlight of the movie (oh and plus the girls too!). I was really amazed by the cheerleading because up here, we don't have that stuff in highschool nor college/university :(
I am really beginning to appreciate Kirsten Dunst as a real super duper actor which probably some of you might know or don't care that I strongly believe that she is one of the most underrated actresses in today's business in the movie industry. She has outshine many of her competitors through which I've seen many flip-flops in the past. Several to name are Tara Reid, Rebecca Gayheart, Freddy Prinze Jr (sorry, I gotta pick on a guy for this one). These so-called potentials have never made it big nor will their career lift off. In addition, her credentials in movies include The Virgin Suicides, Wag the Dog, Spiderman, and many more.There were some other hot actors for example Eliza Dushku who worked on the Buffy: The Vampire Slayer show before she exited and I bet there were more but awe well. Well, what I really wanted to say is that I really enjoyed this film mainly because it made me laughed and it was quite good. A good teen movie like this one comes not so often but some have really captured my eyes such as Get Over It, Final Destination, and a couple more which I forget. So, for those that is going to see the movie, Bring It On, just watch it for the entertainment because I know for a fact that this movie won't get any Oscar nods or any other awards for that matter and for those that saw it, I have this one question, ""Why do you compare it to other acclaim dramas like A Beautiful Mind, The Green Mile?"" when you know that teen romance/comedies is not the same as a drama. They're two separate entities and critics must take apart everything piece-by-piece and look for things like character development, intricate plot/story, mise-en-scene, and so forth. Does every movie have to have an Oscar calibre? Think of the world of only dramas where each individual movie is Oscar material. So, in closing, just enjoy the movie for what it is okay?",Bring It On

Dialog is, like, totally derivative -- and the plot?  You don't want to know.

There is some talented acting in this film, led by Kirsten Durnst--she does an amazing job flexing some good emotional strain on a lightweight of a character, and along with Eliza Dushku, as newcomer Missy, really seems to make this more of a fun film than it really ought to be.Who wins in the end is telegraphed very early, but that's all right as watching the Rancho Carne Squad getting there is a lot of fun.

I never saw a whole (high school) cheerleading squad do standing back tucks. Pike outs, cupies, one arm leg stretches and double-full basket tosses are college moves. I was a cheerleader so I've see many squads at various games, camps and competitions.  The only thing I found wrong with this movie is the fact that there was no coach, for either squad.  Now reguardless if you're the ""best"", you need a coach.  Captians don't run the show like is demonstrated here.

191,william-aaron-kelly,Make you way to the top of the pyramid,10,11 July 2017,"This movie is excellent. Not only does it have a great story for entertainment and your typical starting from the bottom, now we here line, but it has a great amount of knowledge on the truth of social constructs that is now present in modern day America. Run-on sentence, I know forgive me.First of all, I think this movie is great for all people that aren't white. This movie really calls the hell out of white privilege. It shows two awesome perspectives of your typical rich white people living in upper-class San Diego with the one stereotypical pretty Asian girl, but then it shows the other side of the tacks with the poorer majority African-American, Black and Latin communities in Compton. It really makes light of what kind of issues each side face and how they take care of them. For instance, Missy is this privileged little white girl, but has that almost obnoxious self-righteous, my life is terrible, attitude for a lot of the movie. However, her biggest issue is that she just wanted to feel accepted by her peers and be able to make some new pals. While over here with the East Compton Clovers are really facing some tough real life issues, such as financial hardships, being cheated out of the system by rich white people and just trying to stand up for what's right.I think this movie is a great lesson for a lot of privileged people. You can't just cheat your way through the system and expect to stay on top, because sooner or later God will cut you down. This is exactly what happened to the Rancho Carne Toros. Evil Big Red thought she was just going to continue going up to Compton (because apparently she had the gas money to drive 200 miles everyday) and steal the Clovers hard work and meaningful cheers and just get away with it. However, when Isis became cheer captain, she said ""I am not letting these blonde gals steal from us."" Then that is when the Rancho Carne Toros come tumbling down. It just shows that cultural appropriation in the end just makes you look like a complete *expletive*.However, this movie does do a good job at showing a great deal of feminism and not just your typical white feminism. Torrance and Isis both show some great deal of feminism. Torrance really truly cares about the teams that her team screwed over. She feels lost, scared, confused and like her whole life has been a fraud. But instead of backing down she tries to make it right. She gets screwed by a creepy looking ex-boyfriend, but she stands up to him and says ""get out of my life and my way, I am taking this over and this is how we are going to do things for now on."" She even goes to the extent of trying to get all the best competition at the National Cheerleading Finals, because she wants to see some courage and some strength from her squad. This is where Isis though comes in with her great deal of feminism. When Torrance goes out of the way to get a check to give to the Clovers to make their trip to the finals, Isis just blatantly rips it up in her face and says ""we aren't a charity case. I am going to be strong for my squad and we are going to make it to the top, so *expletive*, bring it on."" Torrance pretty much says, ""you know what? *expletive* you, I will bring it on.Because the strength of these two women, the squads both really do come from the bottom and end up at the top together. It really shows how the world can go round if everyone comes together and works hard for what they want, but at the same time be kind to each other and just lift each other up.I was so proud that the Clovers won. It made me feel so enlightened that finally these underprivileged people got to make their way to the top finally.This movie also has a great plot for love. Torrance is dealt a strong love triangle, because she's with her terrible ex-boyfriend, but she loves Missy's brother, Cliff. Cliff also has that typical privileged, but hard, kind of attitude that Missy holds, but shows that he has a sweet endearing loving side.This is a quick shout out to the strong ass gay men that really helped make their squads go all the way to the top too. Love you Les.Anyway, Torrance finally had enough. She was kicked down, manipulated and pretty much beaten emotionally, nevertheless, she persisted. She ended up with the man of her dreams, but she also got the satisfaction of working real hard and hopefully an A in the chemistry class that she shared with Cliff.All in all, this movie has one ending meaning. You can be who you want to be.",Bring It On

I was entertained by the movie, this was showing kind of like spoofs for maybe cheer leading but it did it perfect and I liked it. Some of the jokes didn't do really great but there were jokes that were awesome. The acting was really good, I was surprised by that, everyone did great in the movie. Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku and Jesse Bradford were the best people in the movie. I wasn't bored by the movie, and that shows. The dancing in this movie was really awesome, and that's one of the reasons I like this movie.

It reminded me a lot of Clueless.I saw this movie with my boyfriend, who merely puts up with my cheerleading obsession, and my friend, who also cheers.  All of us, as well as the rest of the theater, were splitting our sides.  I came into this movie with low expectations - I figured I'd be bored until the competition sequence at the end.  I was really pleasantly surprised.  If word gets out, I think this could be the sleeper fluff comedy of the summer.The cheers are pretty lame but the competition sequences are outstanding. The tumbling and stunts are all well done, evidence of the fact that they brought in nationally-ranked choreographers and cheerleaders for the background action.I liked the way the movie gently poked fun at the silly stuff we do to prepare for competition (yes we use that much hairspray), but also brought attention to the athleticism and dedication it takes to be a national champion.This movie was so fun!

I think the main audience for this movie is girls aged 11 - 17(ish), but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's your typical teen movie/chick flick.Performance wise, what can I say? If you've seen Eliza Dushku in anything before - her performance is exactly the same (which in this case is OK). Kirsten Dunst is good, but how hard is it to play a blonde, teenage, cheerleader? The basic jist is The Toro's are cheerleader champs. Torrence (Dunst) is the captain. When Missy (Dushku) joins the squad she points out that all their routines are actually stolen. The Toro's ex-captain stole them of the Clovers - the Toro's rivals. In order to win the championship, the Toro's must develop a totally original routine of their own, to prove the are the best.It's as cheesy as it sounds, but it's ideal for a girl's night in.

How dedicated some people are to such a ridiculous 'sport'. I just don't get it. Kirstin Dunst, who I usually like, I didn't like in this. I don't know if it was the character or what.

I think she is incredibly cute and very gifted, but as a fan of hers, I have to say that she is disappointing me lately.On a different note, I was very impressed with Eliza Dushku's performance. She was very funny and did a great job. I also enjoyed watching the Cheerleading Competitions. The stunts were great and so was the gymnastics. The routines were very entertaining.

I was suprised to see that girl who was in ""True lies"" back in 1994 all grown up who played Dunst's fellow cheerleader.  I liked the story, the plot, the lessons I guess it tried to teach.  The rip off ending of singing and showing screw ups is popular, but props have to go to the originators of something about mary who was first to show that.  Overall, I would say go see it, what do you got to lose.

It plays with your expectations, waving the obvious plot cliche at you and then steps aside and dances off somewhere unexpected. Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku bounce off it each in a playful way, and Gabrielle Union adds just the right amount of compton stereotype without falling overboard. Jesse Bradford makes a great alternative daria-stylee romantic lead. A film that allows for gay teens to be treated as matter of fact, hint at alternative lifestyles for teenage girls and all with a reasonably funny scipt. And some great gymnastic routines thrown in.

Not to mention, the rich white kids from the good side of town, and the poor black kids from the bad side of town.

Now Torros has to come up with their own moves in time for the championships, will they make it?

I went to see it with freinds who happen to be cheerleaders, and somehow they never quite caught the satirical parts - to them it was more of a drama or even a documentary. (When I informed them that it was not meant to be taken seriously and that it's a satire they responded:""Wait, so they're like making fun of cheerleading? What?!"") The film actually has a plot(A bitchy redhead steals cheers from another squad - but oh no! There are only two weeks until the regionals. What do we do now?) , with characters that are sometimes even more than wallpaper, which is more than what can be said about most teen movies. But, don't give it too much credit - each character fits into a nice cookie cutter.Despite the faults, it is a very fun movie and is worth the price of admission just to hear phrases like ""My whole cheerleading career is based on a lie!"" or ""Our cheerleading careers are at stake"" or the best: ""This is a cheer-ocracy and you are acting like a cheer-tator.""

I went to see it only because my friend got me in for free, and I'll have to say, no film has ever totally exceeded my expectations.  Big dumb fun, no more, no less. Anyone who's had to deal with the reality of a respected cheering team understands that utter hilarity of cheering being portrayed as a noble sporting event, but luckily the director was one of these people.  I mean honestly, anyone who once directed episodes of UCB can't be all bad.You got Dushku being sassy, before we saw it 100 times (not that it gets old, but...), Dunst being lovable, and situations being absurd.  I mean, is there any funnier scene in recent history than Sparky Polastry?  It all comes together as one of the best teen comedies in recent history.

You know those people who spend their lives making up rhymes and performing cartwheels? Thought so.So, Torrence (Kirsten Dunst) is promoted to head-cheerleader of her high school Cheerleading squad and they start preparing a routine for finals. But a fellow Cheerleader breaks her leg due to some, shall we say, misjudgement of skill. While she is carted off to hospital, the squad is left without a member and they have to start on a routine for finals. Drama, drama! The team holds try-outs and decides on an alternative gymnast, much to many's disgust. This gymnast is Missy (Eliza Dushku) and she makes the team see what they were doing wrong. Or who they were doing wrong.Love, hate and general bitchiness are in the air throughout the whole film, but the characters are all lovable. Well, mostly anyway...I'd recommend Bring It On for anyone and everyone!! Even if you're favourite movie is The Exorcist, trust me when I say Bring It On will satisfy you. Or at least keep you occupied for an hour or two.",Bring It On

It doesn't get much better than this in the way of chick flicks, with plenty of skimpy bathing suits and short skirts.Most girls will be disgusted with Bring it On, but hey, the guys can still watch while their girlfriends aren't looking, right?",Bring It On
232,rjrules,A great movie not just for cheerleaders.,9,23 August 2001,"Bring It On ROCKS! I really loved how Torrance was so determined, even with all the conflicts in her life. Missy was so cool. She shows how someone can change from one kind of person to a completely different one. Rini Bell did a SUPER job of playing Kasey, the ""not-so-smart"" cheerleader. Gabrielle Union was terrific for the part of Isis. She has the mean streak and the peppiness mixed into one person. I'd recommend this movie to just about anyone.",Bring It On

Just what the world needs right?Well turns out it was just that, except, this was fun and interesting, and humorous all the way through.Any fan of gorgeous guys and girls jumping around in Cheerleader outfits, and being chirpy and crazy, will certainly enjoy this film.There is also a quaint side story of sexuality, like Male cheerleaders could get away without the odd jab (pun intended). Huntley does a great job of playing the ""Contraversial"" cheerleader.See this movie, if for no other reason that Eliza's cute little dance at the door when being collected for her first cheerleading night out.All round, fun, pokes fun at the seriousness people put in such trivial things..

The Cheer Leading competitions looked very real as it was perfectly clear that these actors really trained for this movie. We thought that the production value was great and with a pretty talented cast this movie had everything working for it. The actors had chemistry and worked very well of each other. Very natural performances by the entire cast.We enjoyed the story line and just the overall mood of this movie. Kirsten Dunst was great along with Elisha Dushku. The direction and writing were solid and the cinematography was superb. We highly recommend it.,Bring It On

If you don't end up with a huge grin on your face after watching this film then you're probably a guy that thinks the film was too girly for you and are actually making an effort to stop enjoying it. I'm a guy myself, and I can't see anything wrong with watching girls in really small uniforms show everyone how bendy they are. In some aspects it's more of a guy film than a girl film.The story is nice and solid - OK, it isn't full of plot twisters and mysterious characters, but it's a comedy, not a thriller. It's got quite a nice pace (thanks to some of the scenes they took out that were slowing it down) and has a few of nice surprises evenly spread throughout the film. The dialogue can be a little difficult to grasp the first time round, but anyone that only sees this once is missing out big time anyway. Once you're in the right frame of mind you'll understand all the dialogue and find it pretty funny too.There's only one word that comes anywhere near to describing the routines and the caliber of the performers: wow. Nope, even that doesn't do it justice. You HAVE to watch this film if you have even the slightest bit of enjoyment for dance, gymnastics or attractive people inside you.At least a 9 out of 10, but only because most people will tell me that nothing is worth 10.",Bring It On

240,plum-4,Basically a movie for teens...,7,7 July 2001,"I rented ""Bring It On"" because I heard it detailed a relationship between two male cheerleaders.  Being a gay man, this plotline was of interest to me.  Unfortunately, this wasn't true.  One of the male cheerleaders (the charming and handsome Huntley Ritter) IS gay, but he only serves as the token gay character.I was disturbed by the characters' liberal use of the words ""fag"" and ""dyke.""  While it was generally the idiot football players who uttered these words, this wasn't always the case.  I realize many teens use these words regularly, but I don't see why they had to be repeated over and over.",Bring It On

For fans of Buffy, Eliza Dushku is outstanding as usual and it was fun to see her in this character.  Make sure to stay until the end credits as they show outakes which are also humorous.

The audience also seemed to love it as much as I did. Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku were awesome and very convincing in their respective roles.  The cheerleaders from East Compton High (their arch-rivals- the Clovers )were also outstanding. The movie was very convincing in portraying cheerleaders as being athletes, gymnasts and dancers , who put a lot of time and effort into the routines that the average person only sees for a few minutes at a time. The cheerleading routines were nothing short of amazing and were a joy to watch. The music was great. The movie was very comical, yet also took some serious moments to give us some meaningful insight about the real problems and struggles that the characters faced.The movie also moved along quickly and you had a strong sense of direction at all times as it moved towards the climactic confrontation between the Toros and the Clovers (you will have to see the movie to see how it turned out).",Bring It On

Amy Heckerling should have directed this movie rather than ""Loser.""

Because it didn't stoop to the lowest common denominator and gross you out to get a reaction and actually relied on a witty dialogue and interesting plot line. It also didn't bog down the teenage romance and become all wimpy and dumb (i.e., Down to You, and Boys and Girls) leaving a well made, light hearted comedy.The cast is phenomenal. Kirsten Dunst is by far the BEST actress and comedienne to come out of this whole ""Teen Thing,"" look for her to become the next Julia Roberts or Jodie Foster. Gabrielle Union finally shines in a lead role,  and she does a terrific job. Eliza Dushku is also great. But two characters I loved that haven't gotten enough credit... Natina Reed as Jenelope the feisty Clovers Cheerleader and Huntley Ritter as the token gay cheerleader, Les. Reed deserves her own sitcom, and Ritter is fantastic. A much, MUCH more enjoyable performance then the previously awful ""Voodoo Academy,"" I hope to see a lot more of him.So in conclusion, this movie achieved exactly what it should have. It didn't weigh us down in the racial tension, making itself preachy, it didn't take itself seriously and it didn't insult the audiences intelligence, but presented a funny comedy about cheerleading.",Bring It On
249,kljucec9,A Terrific Movie For Teens of All Ages,8,6 September 2000,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Bring It On"". The film's brisk pacing was  perfectly suited to its theme, thanks to director Peyton Reed, the writing smart, sharp, and consistently and authentically funny,(as well as, at times, genuinely thought-provoking)thanks to writer Jessica Bendinger, and the acting solid all around. I also liked ""Bring It On"" for what it didn't have-alot of tired, cliched boy-girl relationship stuff, and/or gratuitous sex/nudity. The opening dream/cheer sequence was a moment of sheer, brilliant comic/satiric movie magic, and later, when the professional choreographer shows up to help the Toros out, he almost steals the show. But what impressed me, perhaps, most of all about ""Bring It On"" was the wonderful chemistry between the two beautiful-and talented-young female leads, Kirsten Dunst and Eliza Dushku.",Bring It On
250,devilgirl,what a joke.,1,10 September 2000,"The plot was very predictable, and the funny parts weren't funny.  I admit that Kirsten Dunst can act but other than her acting, the movie was disappointing.  I was also offended by all of the stereo-types in the movie, such as white people are rich and blacks are poor.  They over did it on the 2 rebel/punks of the movie too.  Cliff the punk had about 200 posters hanging in his perfectly clean room.  This movie is a disgrace to teenagers, but if your a cheerleader, you might like it.",Bring It On

So many of the positive reviews I have seen prior to this one have had to make disclaimers (e.g. yes, it was childish...) but I will not do so. I am going to be confident in the intelligence of anyone reading this to understand that the quality of a film always has to be taken in the context it was meant to be viewed in. Bring It On is an excellent farce making fun of The Stereotypical Cheerleader. At the same time, the characters were very real, well played, and easy to empathize with. The movement (dance?) was lots of fun to watch. I also felt that the characters were much more realistic than many teenage characters are usually portrayed in film - more sarcastic and intelligently witty and sexual than usual. I think this is good, because many films give the impression that all teenagers are naive and childish, when in fact this is not necessarily the case. I must admit though that I couldn't help thinking that certain things had to happen the way they did for the sake of Political Correctness, and that is disappointing, but from the filmmakers perspective understandable. It was good to see a little bit of gay-friendliness in the film, which is rare to find in any films.Overall, I thought it was a lot of fun and I left the film feeling good!",Bring It On

The main characters self admitted lack of interest in anything academic, other than jumping around like a scantily clad moron, isn't what any sane person would call a good role model. The only high points of the movie are the cheer routines themselves which do show the athletic side of cheering, unfortunatly the cast has to open there mouths and ruin that to.

But it was truly brilliant. The movie kept energised from beginning to end and never lost momentum. The teen humour just kept coming and interspliced with the amazing routines. I found myself falling off my seat as I was enjoying it sooo much!!Well above any other 'teen' genre film (I, unlike previous users, thought it was better than '10 Things I Hate About You' and 'Clueless') Bring It On is a superb film and I recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh and motivating to liven up their life!!",Bring It On

To be honest I didn't laugh once, the only rolling in the aisles was when someone dropped their Tangy Fruits. The acting was appalling and the cinematography was so shocking you couldn't even see the choreography of the cheerleading, which, by the way, is what the film is supposed to be about. It seemed to be aiming for the style of the good old cheesy 80's films (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Teen Wolf) that we all love, but failed miserably both at being funny and at having a decent plot. It is sad to me that a film like ""Bring It On"" can get similar ratings to ""Meet the Parents"" on this website, when the latter is obviously light-years ahead in terms of humour and delivery. Basically, this film is unfunny, and most importantly of all, unentertaining - after all, isn't that what a comedy film is supposed to do? Entertain and amuse?",Bring It On

The direction of the movie was brilliantly done, and the soundtrack fit like a glove. A masterpiece if ever I saw one. Loved it. Just a question, Could anyone tell me the name or the artist who sings the song Sparky gets the girls to dance to?

If you saw this film and expected it to be a deep film, then you were wrong. This movie wasnt going for any oscars--it's just entertaining. I thought of it as being something like ""Clueless w/ pom-poms"".The flick is fun to watch. The music's cool, the routines are entertaining, and the cheesy valley dialogue is funny if you aren't trying to take it too seriously, and the chicks are hot. (Gooo Tsianina Joelson!)Everyone that's reading this probably knows the plot already so I won't go into that. But I thought the movie was well casted (though Duntz' shrill voice was harsh at times). Props to Gabrielle Union, Eliza Dushku, Jesse Bradford, Tsianina Joelson (!!!) and Huntley Ritter for their performances.
This movie has it's moments, w/ memorable scenes like ""Sparky Polastri"" and Nathan West's ""slipping digits"" which make the movie just what the writers intended it to be. Fun.

My favourite actress in this was Eliza Dushku/Missy because she had a totally different role in this than she had in any other films she has done.,Bring It On
268,kav,A guilty pleasure,7,26 January 2002,"I was apprehensive about renting this film, expecting a cheesy, cliché ridden all-American story with a happy ending and a moral (and my reason for wanting to see it basically stretched no further then Eliza Dushku).  You should always trust your instincts.The plot follows the trials and tribulations of Torrance, captain of the cheerleading squad at Rancho Carne high school.  Set in suburbia, the film seemed to be the product of the American suburban inferiority complex. The cheerleaders are all shallow shells of people concerned only with winning at cheerleading, regardless of how hollow their glory has been.  However, even they are overshadowed in the shallow stakes by the obligatory jocks and the freak parade of the auditioning cheerleader-wannabes.  Here all aspects of the Lame White Teenager (tm) are shown, from faux hip-hop to geek robot dancingThe Pantone's, having come from urban LA and therefore being cool, start the film with at least a little substance.  Missy is the typical misfit, daring to be committed (""hardcore gymnast""), having a conscience and not having the pretty blonde looks (despite being gorgeous- how was she cast as not being sexy?).  This soon evaporates however, and within days of being suburban she is assimilated into the fold.  Cliff maintains integrity through the film but is never believable as a character.  As an example, punk fans are generally an elitist lot, and the chances of him even bothering to speak to Torrance again after hearing her views on The Clash are slim, never mind tailing her to various cheerleading meets.The Clovers are obviously put forward as the cool, individualistic characters as being both (a) black and (b) from realer-then-real Compton, are what every hollywood-portrayed suburban kid wishes they were.  They are still not given actual personalities though, just stereotypical 'you go girl' attitudes and a great deal of hostility.At times, the story line practically fell apart.  There are several scenes that are nothing more then links to the next part (Missy and Torrance's 'conversation' before she goes to Cliff's room) and others that just don't make sense (why would Missy know the Clovers' routine? Why would she drive over 100 miles to prove her point to a cheerleader she doesn't really know or like?).  When you have to rationalise large chunks of the plot to yourself, something's gone badly wrong with the script writing.However... For all of this complaining, I did watch the film more than once before it went back.  It does attempt to be satirical for a good half hour, with the dialogue both mocking the cheerleaders (see the opening cheerleading section) and satirising other films/TV programs whose characters have that strange psuedo-intellectual speech pattern.  The interplay between Torrance, Missy and Cliff can work very well (the car wash, the front door, the swings...) and the tooth-brushing scene is the best part of the film.The best character in the film is the dance instructor, Sparky Polastri. It may be because poor script writing has left you with little sympathy for the cheerleaders, but watching them get ripped apart by such a ridiculous character is funny every time.Basically, I would recommend this film for a brainless night in.  Just don't blame me if you feel dirty after watching it.",Bring It On

274,cleere7,Do not expect alot and it can be fun,7,26 September 2001,This is a movie where you know what you are getting when your see the cover of the movie.  It is a nice comedy-teen-romantic movie for everyone. Kirsten Dunst once again is sweet in her leading role whose whole life revolves around cheerleading.  I guess the only reason I watched this movie is for Ms. Dunst.  She is the freshest face now in Hollywood.  She has the All-American girl look that just says hug me.  I cannot wait to see her in Spiderman just because she is so adorable.....,Bring It On
275,schnubbiDCV,Nice movie...,8,7 October 2001,"Bring it on (or Girls United) is a nice movie about moral and friendship. Advantage of this movie: Kirsten Dunst as captain and Eliza Dushku as tough new girl in the team. Nothing to win prizes, I think, but 'easy watching'",Bring It On
276,MaterialGirl850,One of the Worst Movies I Have Ever Seen.,2,29 September 2002,"There really is not a whole lot to say about Bring it On.  My thoughts can be summed up quite quickly: lame and predictable.  Bring it On is supposedly a comedy, but I simply did not find it very amusing.  The only scene I found the least bit amusing was the try-out scene.  I will not tell you how the movie ends, but it is extremely predictable.  I have seen episodes of The Brady Bunch with more plot twists than this movie.  I only recommend Bring it On if you are either a high school cheerleader or have some time to kill.",Bring It On
277,wotaloon,"""Bring it!!"" (Contains spoilers)",10,7 February 2003,"I only watched this movie as a friend of mine kept going on and on about how great it is. A movie about cheerleading didn't really interest me but I watched it to see what she was making such a fuss about. It turned out that she was right!! This is a great movie!!Kirsten Dunst does a good job as Torrance Shipman, the newly appointed captain of the Rancho Carne Toros cheerleading squad. She has a great supporting cast aswell. Most notably Eliza Dushku who plays Missy Pantone, a transfer student and the Toros newest member. Missy soon realises that the Toros routines have been stolen from a rival inner city squad called The Clovers. (Captained by Isis (Gabrielle Union)). The Toros must come up with a new routine before the National Championships, where they will be competing against The Clovers.As a subplot there is a love interest between Torrance and Missy's brother Cliff (Jesse Bradford). It was nice to see the head cheerleader falling for a `normal' guy as opposed to the typical `cheerleader dating head football player' story that usually happens. In fact the football is rubbish and are mocked in this movie, which was a nice change!!The rest of the characters that feature in the Toros are a mixed bunch. From the bitches Courtney (Clare Kramer) and Whitney (Nicole Bilderback), to the smart ass Darcy (Tsianina Joelson) who constantly comes out with big words. Then there are the male cheerleaders Jan (Nathan West) and Les (Huntley Ritter). The question of the sexuality of male cheerleaders is dealt with briefly. Missy: `What is your sexuality?' Les: `Well, Jan's straight, while I'm controversial'The two teams compete at the National Championships and the movie has a fairly predictable ending.Overall, this is an enjoyable and energetic movie with a great soundtrack. The cheer performances are pretty impressive and the music is great. This movie will appeal to males for obvious reasons but there are a few gems here to please us girls!! Namely Jesse Bradford and Nathan West!! This is a great movie that you will enjoy whether you're into cheerleading or not. 10 out of 10",Bring It On
278,madduxgirl,This movie doesn't take itself too seriously,10,17 April 2003,"Another user who commented on this movie compared it to such teen movies as Dick, Rushmore, 10 Things I Hate About You and Election. That was their first problem. Bring It On is not, nor was it intended to be, in the same category as these movies. All of these movies are great in their own right, but in my opinion comparing them is like comparing apples and oranges. Granted, you don't necessarily have to put on your thinking cap when watching Bring It On, but that's part of the beauty of the movie. It gets it's point across without beating it into your head. Maybe cheerleading isn't as easy as it looks. Maybe cheerleaders aren't as dumb as they look. Maybe if you get past your initial opinion of someone, you'll find that you have more in common than you expected. The bottom line is that some days, after a long day at work, I just want to put a movie in and be highly entertained for a few hours, and Bring It On is the perfect movie for that.",Bring It On

280,phillipsjackie7,Clever Symbolism,5,19 December 2012,"Today I'm going to review a piece of cinema that my younger sister was watching. It goes by the name, ""Bring it on"" 2000, and stars Kirsten Dunst (whatta gem) and Gabrielle Union. I know it came out in 2000, but 12 years ago it was far too mainstream for me to review, and now it's taken on a slightly retro- post ironic tilt. So, Torrance Shipman (Dunst) is a peppy cheerleader from San Diego, who is appointed head cheerleader of the ""Toros"" by the graduating ""Big Red"" (she's a redhead, if you didn't get that.) Chaos ensues as the cheerleaders find that Big Red had been stealing cheer routines from the East Compton team, the Clovers. Their captain, Isis (Union) is not happy about this, and vows to take her team to nationals. Lots of lessons are learned about believing in yourself and so on and so forth. My first issue with this movie are the stupid names. Torrance? The entire movie, I thought they were saying Taurus. And Isis? Both of those names would be excellent stripper pseudonyms. My second issue was the symbolism. Now, ""Big Red"" is obviously a symbol of an oppressive, ""Big Brother-esque"" distopia, brought on by the 90's dotcom bubble, (symbolized by the eager, too willing to make sacrifices and break rules Torrance Shipman). But what did Torrance's manic, slightly robotic college boyfriend symbolize? My first thought was that the director, Peyton Reed, was trying to bring in a neo-sincerist vibe, but I realized that this wasn't possible in 2000, a pre-ironist world. Was Peyton Reed, with his horribly one sided characters and inane dialogue an iconoclast? Or was he created fodder for cinephiles to cry over as they sip Chianti? You be the judge.",Bring It On
281,lordneplusultra,Worst Movie Ever.,1,8 January 2005,"This movie is by far the worst that I have ever seen. If this movie was a person it would be a combination of Omarosa and Osama. It is so bad that even its utterance makes me sick. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would have given it a zero(as in an absolute zero; as in anything below this point would defy the laws of physics)-just like the malignity of this movie.(malignity is not the correct word, because no word can convey how utterly bad this movie is)I'm not even going to explain why this movie is bad because you would have to be a complete moron(a Ralph Wiggum or Chief Wiggum level of stupidity) to not see how horrible this movie is. It's just bad.",Bring It On
282,Spikes_Kitten,"Funny, Loud and Great Stuff",9,9 April 2005,"Bring It On is about a girl called Torrance(Dunst) who becomes the captain for the Rancho Carno's cheerleading squad. After recruiting a 'hardcore gymnast'called Missy(Dushku) she finds out that the old captain, Big Red, stole all of their routines from another squad.This movie is fun to watch ad doesn't take itself too seriously. Eliza Dushku offers a great performance and Clare Kramer(Courtney, Buffy's Glory) has the bitchy cheerleader act down to a 't'. The routines are amazing.The only part that I didn't really like was the ending, it was slightly predictable but it was overall still a great movie.'Clueless With Pom-poms'",Bring It On
283,CiciCee,"I love it, but.........",9,23 November 2005,"Okay, I thought this was a great movie for the most part. It was one of my favorite movies for a really long tome, but now that I've matured a bit let me tell you my feelings towards the movie. I felt a bit guilty letting my little sister watch it because it had a lot of language that she doesn't hear every day like i do at high school. There were rude gestures that she didn't understand but questioned. That was rather awkward, and I didn't really answer truthfully. But let me say that as a former cheerleader, it was really very accurate and funny too. I understood the pains they went through in order to get to regionals. I loved it, but let me say that my mom wouldn't approve if she knew what it was about.",Bring It On
284,rmantegani,Most infuriating piece of garbage ever to be made by a human being,1,26 August 2006,"Why is it that this movie was so good that about forty films just like it have been made through-out the course of this decade? It was HORRID and the copycat films keep getting worse as they pop out from this crew of stupid Hollywood writer's big, dumb heads! We haven't seen a good teen comedy since American Pie and I think that we need a good teen comedy to wake up all the brain dead morons of today.F*ck you, whoever wrote this screenplay and go find a hole somewhere to die in, you sick disgusting cockroach! You caused for all this to happen and everything else that followed it like John Tucker Must Die and Legally Blonde and all those other movies and this ones sequels!",Bring It On
285,davieabounds,VERY GOOD!!,10,15 October 2018,"As you see above, I have rated this movie a 10 out of 10. This movie is about two high school cheer teams that have conflict with each other in the competition process. The Toros were a well-funded cheer team that was very popular for their championship winning streak. They had so many good cheers and routines that everyone loved. That brings us to the Clovers, a cheer team from Compton, California. They had fire routines but never had enough money to compete. The Clovers ended up finding out that the Toros had been stealing all their routines.
For this reason, the movie was very well scripted and written. I loved it so much because it personally made me want to keep watching it until the end. I did not get bored of it. From beginning to end this movie was very detailed and was always catching my attention. One of the many lessons I learned from this movie is that there are consequences to all of your actions. This movie also teaches you also be the bigger person in a problem. this movie is also funny, I like how it is not serious the whole time, even though there was conflict, it still had humor in it which is never a dull thing for a movie. It also teaches you to have fun regardless of what could be going on. Another lesson that this movie taught me was that rewards are given to those who truly work, cheating does not get you anywhere. This movie is personally my favorite. It is cute, fun, and really enjoyable for those who show interest in these types of movies. I highly recommend.",Bring It On
