0,Leofwine_draca,Flawed attempt to breathe new life into an old story,4,25 April 2017,"Dracula Untold is an attempt to breathe new life into the vampire legend by telling the fateful story of Vlad Tepes, aka Vlad the Impaler, and looking at the circumstances that led to him becoming one of the most notorious figures in European history. This is an unashamedly supernatural story featuring Charles Dance as an age-old scaly vampire and lots of supernatural moments involving neck-biting and the like.While I appreciate the new angle this film approaches the story from, I have to say that in terms of execution it falls flat. It's not really a horror film at all, more of an action picture like the UNDERWORLD films albeit with a historical setting. Most of the film consists of mindless battle sequences accompanied by incessant swarms of CGI bats and the like. Luke Evans is a weak and ineffectual lead and the likes of Dominic Cooper, Paul Kaye, Ronan Vibert, and Zach McGowan are wasted in support with absolutely nothing to do other than go through the motions. It's a real waste of time and money.",Dracula Untold
1,SnoopyStyle,problematic origins story,4,22 August 2015,"In 1442, the Turks enslaved 1000 boys from Transylvania and used as Janissary troops. Prince Vlad was one of those boys and his ruthless exploits would earn his nickname Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans). He would eventually rule Transylvania peacefully as a vassal to the Ottoman empire. Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) is marching on Venice and demands 1000 boys from Transylvania. Vlad keeps his vow to his wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and battles the Turks rather than send his son. Vlad goes to Broke Tooth Mountain to seek help from the Master Vampire (Charles Dance). After Vlad drinks the Vampire's blood, he gets his supernatural powers. If he resists drinking human blood for 3 days, he would return to be human. If he drinks, he would be a vampire forever and could be called upon to help his maker one day.There is too much exposition. It saps away much of the tension from the beginning. It starts off lifeless and tired. The 3 days rule is problematic for a number of reasons. It would be more compelling to straight-up exchange his soul for his kingdom. Instead, he's renting out his soul which is less compelling.Giving the origins of Dracula a movie has some good potential. Luke Evans does a commendable job. Dracula fighting the Turks could have been another 300. This is nowhere near as good. The battles are neither fun nor suspenseful. Dracula is almost Superman and should easily defeat the Turks by himself.That leads to the question of Vlad's illogical strategy. Why is he going back to his family and his people when he hungers for human blood? Why isn't he out hunting Turks from sunset to dawn? Why doesn't he just battle the Turks by himself? Why doesn't he go find Mehmed as soon as possible? Vlad's incomprehensible lack of strategy weakens this movie to its core.",Dracula Untold
2,Prismark10,Dracula Untold,4,2 July 2020,"Dracula Untold is the vampire story re-imagined as a dark comic book adventure.Luke Evans plays Vlad the Impaler who as a boy was handed to the Turkish Sultan to be trained as a warrior.Now the ruler of Transylvania finds that the same fate could befall his son from the new sultan (Dominic Cooper). In order to save his people, Vlad seeks out out a Nosferatu type hermit (Charles Dance) in a cave who devours any passing human.Vlad does a deal with the vampire where he drinks some of his blood, this will give Vlad the powers of a vampire temporarily. If he resists drinking human blood for three days, then he will become human again.The juiced up Vlad, get super strength, can transform to a cloud of bats and the Turkish invaders are no match for this one man bat army.Although a choppy film. It tries to be a Tolkien type adventure with plenty of CGI battle scenes with some Gothic romance. It is moderately successful as it is colourfully entertaining thanks to Luke Evans.It is far away from the Dracula legend as you can get. It is more of an Underworld type movie crossed with Superman. There is even a scene where silver represents Kryptonite.",Dracula Untold
3,mark.waltz,"Evil is evil, no matter what the gains are from it.",4,17 May 2016,"Yes, once again, the dark prince of terror is back, fighting the Turks to retain peace. So what does Vlad the Impaler do to retain peace? Make a deal with the devil, of course. That requires a meeting with the dark spirit of the cave, a fellow cursed former mortal who shows him the secret of winning the battle, through an eternal death making him the walking dead through life giving blood. Yes, this starts just like the 1993 Francis Ford Coppola horror classic which romanticized Dracula and was extremely successful at how it did that. But two decades later and almost eighty-five years since the first sound Dracula, he's back and as a devoted family man. Of course, when you are the prince of the medieval kingdom of Transylvania, you got to resort to whatever means necessary to keep your enemy from getting in, and that includes giving up your soul.Prince Vlad has a wife he adores and a young son, but the Sultan of Turkey kidnaps the young prince which resorts to Vlad making a deal with the devil, seen here in vampire/ human form as Charles Dance who resides in the haunted cave. There's nothing wrong with giving a Dracula story before he came to modern England, the Bram Stoker story that everybody has seen in one form or another. The problem isn't that they did it, but how they did it and there are many unbelievable elements to the classic tale of historical horror. One such incident occurs when a character falls off of the mountain top castle seemingly thousands of feet, yet can speak and isn't all bloody when they land on the jagged rocks below. Two evils going up against each other doesn't equal a right, and this is obviously an attempted entry to a series of Dracula films where the attempts to moralize him are obvious. How do you solve a problem like a vampire? Well everybody knows that a vampire will disintegrate in daylight or if impaled, and in the case of this vampire, he's got enough of the setup to create horror for several films to last over a period of several centuries. It seems to me that the motivations of the filmmakers who try to romanticize vampires and make them cool or misguidedly artistic, and while the classic Dracula films ultimately ended up with his demise, they were at least entertaining and well-crafted. This just manipulate its audience with the computer-generated effects giving us much time for little morality and that makes the premise of the film disturbing. I can enjoy these for what they are, but I feel if necessary to point out that the reasoning behind them isn't necessarily with good intentions sometimes still going too far.",Dracula Untold
4,claudio_carvalho,The Origin of Dracula,8,8 February 2015,"In 1442, the Prince Vlad, the Impaler (Luke Evans) rules the Transylvania after serving the Turkish Sultan as a soldier since he was a child. Vlad is happily married with his beloved wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and their son, Ingeras (Art Parkinson), is their pride and joy. When Vlad and his soldiers find a Turkish helmet in the river, he goes with two men to a cave in the Broke Tooth Mountain expecting to find Turkish scouts. However they stumble upon a deadly creature (Charles Dance) that kills the two men, but Vlad succeeds to escape alive from the cave. He learns that the creature is a vampire.On the next day, a Turkish group of soldiers come to the Castle Dracula to collect the taxes but the emissary tells to Vlad that the Turkish Sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) is demanding one thousand boys to be trained for the Turkish army. Vlad unsuccessfully tries to negotiate with Mehmed and when the soldiers come back again to take his son, Vlad kills all of them. Then he goes to Broke Tooth Mountain and meets the vampire. He explains that he needs his power to defeat his enemies; otherwise his people will be slaughtered by the Turkish army. The vampire offers his blood to Vlad but explains what could happen. Vlad would temporarily have his power for three days and if he resists to the thirsty of blood, he would turn back to his human condition. But if he does not resist, he would turn into a vampire forever. Vlad accepts the offer and defeats the Turkish soldiers, but soon he understands the price he has to pay to acquire his power.""Dracula Untold"" is an underrated action movie with the story of the origin of Dracula. This movie has a dramatic and full of action story, disclosed through great screenplay, special effects and music score. Luke Evans is perfect in the role of a prince capable of an ultimate sacrifice to save his beloved family and people. It is funny to see the comment that a vampire action movie does not have historical accuracy. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Drácula: A História Nunca Contada"" (""Dracula: The Untold Story"")Note: On 07 May 2018, I saw this film again on Blu-Ray.",Dracula Untold
5,nogodnomasters,SOMETIMES THE WORLD NEEDS A MONSTER,8,30 July 2018,"Luke Evans gives us a different type of Dracula, one I didn't expect. The childhood of Vlad is read to us. Vlad becomes the reluctant monster in order to have the strength to save his people from the Turks who are demanding 1,000 boys in addition to the tribute. Vlad enters into ""the immortal game of revenge"" to turn him into Uma Thurman on steroids.I enjoyed the set up and the initial battle. The film slowed after that until the ending fight scenes which were anti-climatic at that point.And what was that with vampires and silver? Silver is for werewolves. That made the whole film unbelievable.No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.",Dracula Untold
6,kosmasp,Underworld begins,6,3 April 2015,"No it's just about a vampire (not just any vampire of course) and not about Lycans. But this feels like it could be in the same universe like those Underworld movies. It's slick, it has that same general feeling to it, just that it stars a male instead of a woman. The action is decent and you do know where this is heading early on.Luke Evans can do big budget (also Hobbit), but is able to get really down and dirty too (see ""No one lives"" and hopefully ""Crow"" soon) and he's showing it off here too. If you like your horror to be in the Hollywood popcorn corner, you'll have a lot of fun with this. Just because something was ""untold"" doesn't mean it's not predictable. I don't think it made enough money, so we won't see a sequel/prequel in the near future ... Sorry Dracula, but I told you so",Dracula Untold
7,classicsoncall,"""My name is Dracula, Son of the Devil!""",8,4 September 2018,"The name of Dracula has for many decades been known as the name of a fictional vampire, but prior to that and for many centuries, was considered the nickname of Vlad III, or Vlad the Impaler. His father was Vlad Dracul, 'the Dragon'; 'Dracula' was another form of the name used to describe the son of Dracul. In modern Romania, Dracul means 'the Devil', and went a long way to contribute to Vlad's reputation. This 'origin' story of Dracula actually did a pretty good job of explaining all that. The film makers here took that historical component and did a commendable job of creating a vampire myth based on the legend of Vlad the Impaler, who was given a task and challenge by the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) of Broken Tooth Mountain. Taken with appropriate grains of salt, the story goes on to describe how Vlad (Luke Evans) opposed the Turkish Sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper), who demanded that he pay tribute to the Turks of a thousand young boys, including his own son, to form an army for further conquest of non-Turkish lands. For a good part of the story, it looked like Vlad would be able to honor a commitment to abstain from drinking the blood of a human for three days, in order to remain human himself. However the death of his wife gave rise to an outrage that could only be satisfied by consuming her blood and taking it out on Mehmed and the Turkish army. Much of what one knows about vampire lore is given treatment in the story, like the bite of a vampire creating another one, and the terror of sunlight that causes a vampire to disintegrate. Expanding on Bela Lugosi's transformation in the original 1931 ""Dracula"" film, Vlad III has the ability not only to turn into a bat, but to command legions of the flying devils to effect final victory. I guess if one is bothered by this expansion of the Bram Stoker inspired Dracula legend, the film might not appeal to you. Actually, Stoker's working papers for his novel contain no references to the historical Vlad the Impaler, and some historians question whether he even knew much about him, at least not enough to be inspired by the Thirteenth Century warrior and leader. But if it's a different kind of action/adventure film you're looking for, this one will satisfy with it's dark themes and it's unique take on the origin of the vampire legend.",Dracula Untold
8,gavin6942,Excellent Telling of the Dracula Legend,7,4 February 2015,"As his kingdom is being threatened by the Turks, young prince Vlad Tepes must become a monster feared by his own people in order to obtain the power needed to protect his own family, and the families of his kingdom.Any time a Dracula film is made, it has a stigma put upon it. There have been many, probably scores, of films about Dracula, but only a small handful that have gone on to be classics. Those include Murnau's ""Nosferatu"", Universal's original ""Dracula"", Hammer's ""Dracula"" and Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 incarnation. Others either get a second tier (such as Dan Curtis' version) or have failed miserably (Dario Argento's mess).This version, released from Universal, has that added burden because the company has a long history with Dracula, going back 80 years. How they handle the character is very important. Although some seem skeptical about Universal's plan to create a ""Monster Universe"", if this film is any indication, it might not be half bad. And as charming as the 1940s crossover films were (particularly ""House of Frankenstein""), we must admit they are cheesy and there is room for improvement.We are given the historical Vlad Tepes in this version, not the ""Count Dracula"" of Bram Stoker. Of course, some elements of Stoker are clearly here; the real Vlad had no vampire blood coursing through his veins. But this seems to take the middle ground, with Dracula being more timeless and superhuman, less evil or dirty. In some respect, he can even be seen as a hero.Is the history here accurate (ignoring the vampire part)? Probably not. But it works, and sets up a rich character with a deep history, some emotions and a reason to exist. This is a well-written character, not the one-dimension bloodsucker in previous outings.Horror fans may be disappointed that this is more action than horror, but anyone who says this is a bad film is trying to find something to dislike. Compared to the sloppy ""I, Frankenstein"" (not a Universal film), this one has real potential for sequels and more.",Dracula Untold

10,paul_haakonsen,Shallow movie...,4,28 December 2015,"This movie was a major disappointment, especially if you like the story of Dracula. Why? Well, because it had absolutely no solid story. It was just a shallow movie experience presented in an array of spectacular special effects.I guess director Gary Shore wanted to tell the Dracula story from the warlord's point of view, that being Vlad Tepes. But he didn't succeed that gracefully. Sure the fight scenes were impressive, but they were mere backdrops and fillers to the actual storyline.The acting was fair and the CGI good, and that was essentially what kept this movie afloat. Was it a great movie? Hardly. Was it a good movie? No. Was it entertaining? Mildly so. Will it be a movie that you will watch more than once? No.I was told that this was an amazing movie, hat is why I bought it. And I was sorely disappointed as the movie came to an end. It was like a slap to the face, especially if you like the myth that is Dracula.When Mirena fell from the castle and landed on the ground below, I was laughing so hard at the stupidity of it all. She should have died many times over from the distance of that fall.All in all, ""Dracula Untold"" was a less than mediocre movie.",Dracula Untold
11,michaelRokeefe,Not another re-telling of the Braums Stoker Dracula.,7,24 November 2018,"A blend of history and vampire mythology, a different glance at the legendary Dracula. A young Prince (not Count) Dracula, known as Vlad Tepes, (Luke Evans), a noble hero seeks out dark powers to protect his people threatened by a mighty throng of Turks. The storyline immediately seems to be ridiculous with a highly predictable plot, but to no avail. The romantic element of willing to give up his young son and leave his beautiful wife practically unprotected to become a monster to save his believers is what matters. This foray into darkness has Vlad the impaler transforming into a swarm of bats to kick butt. Quite visual with creative action and sustainable suspense.The cast also features: Sarah Gadon, Charles Dance, Noah Huntley, Zach McGowan, Samantha Banks and Dominic Cooper.",Dracula Untold
12,Theo Robertson,Good Enough As Long As You Don't Think Of It As A Horror Film,7,10 December 2014,I remember the 1992 version of Dracula by Francis Ford Coppola and thinking that the best part of that version was the anti-heroic Prince Vlad defending Europe against the Ottoman invasion . I do believe there is a market for a historical epic featuring the true life story of Vlad the impaler . This version from 2014 does come close to it in some ways but let's be honest and say no one is going to watch any movie with Dracula in the title unless it features a vampire in the title role and one wonders how many people might have been disappointed by the marketing if not the title alone ? One group of people who will be bitterly disappointed will be Turks . While the Persians are still recovering from their portrayal in 300 and its sequel the Muslim Turks might have just been lured in to a sense of false security after MIDNIGHT EXPRESS but low and behold along comes DU . The Turks aren't painted in a good light and one wonders if there might be a rather dubious subtext when the Sultan demands a thousand boys for his army ? That said at least Vlad himself isn't a noble traditional type of nationalist hero and the film does show him struggling against internal dilemmas . It's not really an actors type of character driven cinema but Luke Evans is suitably brooding while best performance is Dominic Cooper as Mehmed who doesn't appear on screen often enough here and is probably the film's trump card DU isn't a masterpiece and again it's very important that you go in to this film with the knowledge it's more of a dark sword and sorcery type tale rather than a horror movie . It wasn't until after I saw it that I found out Universal Pictures might be using it to do a reboot of their monster franchise from the 1930s and 40s which explains the ending that jars with the rest of the movie . Do we genuinely want another reboot series ? As it stands this version of Dracula is more than adequate and maybe we should let Eastern European vampires stay dead,Dracula Untold
13,CinemaSerf,A fair-to-middling new take on an old legend.,6,1 December 2019,"I think you have to treat this depiction of Dracula on it's own merits. There is no point comparing it with anything you've seen already. Given that, it is a perfectly watchable, and forgettable, adventure film with Luke Evans as Prince Vlad making the vampiric equivalent of a ""deal with the devil"" with Charles Dance to prevent his family and his kingdom from being over-run by the Turks. Dominic Cooper is really terrible as the Ottoman Sultan, though - his accent sounds like it's been finessed in his local kebab shop after too many tequila slammers on a Friday night. Expect nothing earth shattering and you won be let down.",Dracula Untold
14,utgard14,"""I just want peace. That's all.""",6,28 December 2014,"Alright, I know this type of movie (and this one specifically) pisses some people off. I totally get why. Like a lot of you, I've been burned out on these things and long for a return to more traditional horror movies where the monsters are scary, not romantic action heroes. But I have to put that aside and judge this fairly on its own merits and how it entertained me. And I have to admit, I actually liked it. Yes, it is a mostly vapid action-horror movie in the style of the Underworld movies or (God forbid) I, Frankenstein. And yes, it uses a real historical figure in a completely fictional way. A real historical figure that, at the very least, was a mass murderer. The characters all have stylish modern haircuts and are, almost to a person, attractive and 'cool.' Dominic Cooper's haircut is especially anachronistic and silly. The movie is full of the CGI and action movie set pieces that have become so familiar over the last decade or so. Still, this is enjoyable for what it is. Luke Evans is very good and I wouldn't mind seeing him in a sequel that would follow the Stoker novel (which is teased at the end of this). Charles Dance steals all of his scenes as the Master Vampire who turns Dracula. I've read that Universal plans to make a series of these types of films using their classic monster characters, similar to how Marvel is doing with their superhero stuff. My gut reaction to that is negative but my enjoyment of this is slowly bringing me around to thinking maybe that doesn't have to be terrible. After all, I can either whine about how things aren't or face the way things are. I choose to do the latter and try to find some good where there is some. This movie entertained me and that's all it really set out to do so I give it props for that.",Dracula Untold
15,zardoz-13,Get Mad About Vlad!!!,5,12 October 2014,"The best thing about ""Dracula Untold"" is its picturesque appearance. A tapestry of gorgeous computer generated imagery, this predictable prequel about Bram Stoker's immortal bloodsucker before he forsook his sword for his fangs contains a few surprises. Essentially, Universal looks like the studio has rebooted the franchise. Luke Evans, who played in ""Clash of the Titans,"" ""Immortals,"" ""The Three Musketeers,"" and the last two ""The Hobbit"" movies, seems appropriately cast as the protagonist. Sadly, he brings little charisma to the role. When he wields a sword, rides horse, and cavorts about in period apparel, Evans looks like he knows what he is doing. Indeed, he is the 'before' Dracula, better known as Vlad Tepes, who impaled his adversaries on stakes for the terrible psychological effect it wrought. Unfortunately, Dominic Cooper struggles to be villainous. Aside from ominous eye-liner and elaborate armor, the plucky little Englishman from ""Need for Speed"" doesn't pose much of a threat. The problem is that Cooper's Turkish Sultan Mehmed II isn't half as sinister as his wicked lieutenant, Dumitru (Diarmaid Murtagh of ""The Monuments Men""), who instills greater fear. Although Dracula and Mehmed clash swords in a dramatic but drawn-out fight scene near the end, with Dracula stumbling around on a treacherous floor of silver coins, the fight is virtually anti-climactic after our hero's encounter with Dumitru. Comparably, as supernatural horror movies go, ""Dracula Untold"" isn't scary. Some spooky scenes in a cave with Charles Dance as the Master Vampire generate shivers, but this PG-13 rated potboiler is more of a spectacle than a shocker. Imagine the Gerald Butler action fantasy ""300"" crisscrossed with Peter Jackson's J.R.R. Tolkien trilogies, and you'll have a clue about what to expect from this nimble, but immaculate 92 minute epic. ""Dracula Untold"" unfolds with a prologue about Vlad's sadistic wartime past as told by his son Ingeras. Suspense takes flight from the outset since we know nothing catastrophic can occur to Ingeras if he can provide fodder about his father's infamous feats. The imperial Ottoman Turks enthrone Dracula as the Prince of Transylvania after his splendid sadistic exploits in battle. Our hero marries a sweet, lovely, but naïve bride, Mirena (Sarah Gadon of ""Charlie Bartlett""), promises her peace, and they have a son, Ingeras (Art Parkinson of ""Freakdog""), who has not a care in the world. Dracula continues to appease the Sultan of Turkey with tributes that consist of treasure chests piled with silver coins. One day, while Dracula and two soldiers are out scouting the countryside, they find a dented Turkish helmet in a stream and search for the army that the Sultan has sent to their homeland. Dracula and company trace the helmet back to a cave in Broken Tooth Mountain where they encounter the Master Vampire (Charles Dance of ""Last Action Hero"") who makes mince meat of Dracula's lieutenants. No sooner has Dracula survived this predicament than he arrives home to be greeted by a Turkish envoy who wants more than his customary monetary tribute. Not only does the envoy demand thousands of boys as conscripts for the Sultan's army, but also he specifically wants Dracula's son Ingeras. Naturally, Dracula refuses to hand over Ingeras. Later, after a diplomatic episode ends with bloodshed, Dracula returns to the mountain and negotiates a pact with the Master Vampire. Since he lacks an army to pit against the Sultan, Dracula resorts to sorcery. Of course, when he reveals that he has sold his soul, Dracula finds himself persona non grata. As the Sultan's armies lay siege to Dracula's Castle, all Hell breaks loose, and Dracula prepares to retaliate with his supernatural powers.Moviegoers who relish buckets of blood as well as an abundance of severed body parts will be sorely disappointed with ""Dracula Untold."" Freshman film director Gary Shore, who has been directing television commercials, provides a high enough body count by anybody's standards, but the MPAA's chaste PG-13 rating has compelled him to scale back considerably on the bloodletting. Swords shriek as combatants unsheathe them and glint as the aforementioned hack away at their enemy with feverish abandon. Nevertheless, contact between blade and flesh has been minimized. One of the more imaginative images of warfare is the reflection of bloodshed in a sword. Only time will tell if an unrated version will accompany the home video release. Meantime, Shore keeps the action moving briskly enough, in part because rookie co-scripters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless have penned such a contrived, formulaic, origins screenplay. Memorable dialogue is certainly not one of their assets. Meantime, after impaling thousands of combatants on pikes, Vlad must have lost his nerve because he behaves like a wimp when the Sultan shows up looking for juvenile recruits. Indeed, Sazama and Sharpless paint Dracula into a corner, but it is still difficult to believe Dracula would have degenerated from a warlord into a whiner. Since Shore had to diminish the violence, the only thing menacing about the Sultan's army is its immense size. Mind you, Dumitru's coiffure qualifies as pretty disturbing. Once Dracula acquires immortality from the Master Vampire, he is practically unbeatable. Evans is shown poised on a cliff, gesticulating passionately with his arms like a wizard, as he dispatches hundreds of colonies of bats against the Turks, emphasizing the real meaning of the word 'combat.' Nevertheless, the violence is depicted in such broad strokes that you cannot see how the bats are actually slaughtering their opponents.Little in ""Dracula Untold"" constitutes a revelation. Most of what happens is roughly based on sections of Stoker's 1897 Gothic tale of terror. Francis Ford Coppola's above-average ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" covered his chapter of Dracula's life with greater artistry and action. Additional movies such as ""Vlad"" (2003), ""Dracula the Impaler"" (2002), Vlad Tepes"" (1979) as well as the made-for-television opus ""Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula"" (2000) has embellished Dracula's origins. Although it has some potential, ""Dracula Untold"" qualifies as a second-rate sword and sorcery saga.",Dracula Untold
16,grantss,Doesn't really add anything new...,4,21 September 2015,"Despite pretensions to the opposite, this movie doesn't really add anything new to the Dracula lexicon.Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of the most adapted-to-screen books ever written. The Dracula movies seem to come at almost yearly intervals! So, when another one, this one, came out I thought ""ho hum, here we go again"". However, if the marketing was anything to go by, this promised to be closer to the true story of Vlad the Impaler (aka Dracula).It started off reasonably well, following Vlad while he leads his Kingdom during the rule of the Turks. However, it degenerates pretty quickly into a common-or-garden action movie, just with a vampire as the hero. If anything it subtracts from the Dracula legacy, as it turns a vampire drama into a vampire action movie, and a pretty standard, predictable one at that.Gets pretty conventional and dull, very quickly.Can Hollywood stop making Dracula movies now, please...? It's been done to death and there really is no room for originality left in the story.",Dracula Untold
17,oscaralbert,Ripping the top two stories from today's headlines . . .,6,15 October 2014,". . . DRACVLA UNTOLD provides we film-goers with hints at how to proceed in These Difficult Times. We all awoke this morning to the news that the doctors and nurses at that Ebola Hospital in Dallas are coming down with the virus themselves. I seem to remember that the authorities in OUTBREAK were faced with a similar situation and nuked some town in Colorado, while Brad Pitt's cronies in WORLD WAR Z waited too long, losing most of Humanity. In DRACU!A UNTOLD, Vlad\Drac tells the Alpha Vamp that it's better to impale an entire town of Innocents to save 10 other villages than not, so he's obviously advising us (if you ask yourself WWDD?) to nuke Dallas before it's too late (and the virus spreads to Cleveland). On CNN this morning, they said that Baghdad is about to fall to the ISIS horde. This is just like what happened in DRACU1A UNTOLD, when Mehmet II says that his Turkish Wrath is about to overflow into all the Capitals of Europe. Dracula decides that this is no time to be Politically Correct, so he uses his frowned upon Dark Powers to save Transylvania for the next 500-plus years. You can surmise from that that Mr. D is suggesting that we nuke ISIS, too.",Dracula Untold
18,george.schmidt,Batman origin story,6,12 October 2014,"Dracula UNTOLD (2014) ** Luke Evans, Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, Charles Dance, Diarmaid Murtagh, Pau Kaye. The infamous vampire gets his own origin story that was hinted at in BRAM STOKER's Dracula, namely that Transylvanian prince Vlad (The Impaler) (Evans brooding magnificently) makes a deal with the devil (in murderous, formidable form of Dance relishing the nasty monster hidden in the nefarious caves) in order to protect his family and kingdom from the bloodthirsty Turks in 15th century warfare. While the production design by Francois Audouy and breathtaking cinematography by Josh Schwartzman is breathtakingly audacious the script by newbie Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless falters only in the fact we all know who Dracula already is and not truly breathing new life into a (un)dead corpse. Gary Shore's directorial debut is a huge undertaking and employing the dazzling digital and visual special effects to the hilt has an eye for the big picture and even the poignant love story which all could've been hamfisted or even trite. A mix bag of an ancient tale but not as terrible as expected; just not as good either.",Dracula Untold
19,neil-476,Tmospheric but limp,7,10 October 2014,"Vlad Tepes, ruler of Transylvania, is a sensitive and devoted family man, notwithstanding a tendency to impale enemies on spikes. When Transylvania is invaded by an overwhelming Turkish army, Vlad has only one option to try to save his beleaguered people: so he pays a call on the savage and murderous old vampire who lives in a cave up a nearby mountain. It does not turn out well.This film reinvents Dracula as a tragic romantic hero, and does so by backpedalling on the horror. Charles Dance's Vampire Sr. is pretty horrible, but he hoiks his victims off into the shadows. The facial make-up and morphing as suitably horrific, but the whole thing is somewhat lacking in hard core. I suppose this goes along with the whole idea of trying to sell us on the notion that someone who, variously, impales people on spikes or rips their throats out is actually a good-looking, touchy-feely family guy, always cuddling and weeping over oh how horrible and unfair it all is. Sorry, but that's not any Dracula I am prepared to accept.It's a shame, because there is some good action and the visuals are nicely atmospheric, if (as usual) dark. They mess about with The Rules a bit. Dance is good, Luke Evans comes over as a bit lightweight, the lad playing his son is really annoying.I liked the epilogue.",Dracula Untold

Upon accepting the terms demanded of the Vampire what Vlad doesn't fully appreciate is the power passed on to him--or the price he will have to pay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting movie which started off really well and had some good graphics to support it. Additionally, I also liked the dark and dismal setting as well. Unfortunately, the director (Gary Shore) allowed the action and CGI to get out-of-control and then made another key mistake by deviating from the normal vampire traditions by giving Vlad an excessive amount of power and ability. Yet, in spite of all of this, the movie itself was still viewable for the most part and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Dracula Untold

With his beloved wife, Mirena, Vlad has brokered a period of peace, and has ensured that his people are protected, especially from the Ottoman Empire. When Sultan Mehmed II demands 1,000 of the country's boys, including Vlad's son, for his army, Vlad makes a deal with a monster that will enable him to defeat the Turks.......but cost him his humanity........So the most famous vampire of them all gets an origin story, and this film was up posed to kickstart a franchise that would see origin stories for all of the Universal monsters of the thirties, but alas, it's not going to happen, as this film is boring beyond belief.So Dracula was born due to an encounter with Charles Dance, who's overacting in this would put Ben Kingsley to shame, and the rest of the film sees Luke Evens staring into the proverbial abyss, trying to look for an answer, but instead he looks bewildered.The cast are great, Dance asides, the performances are flawless, and Evans has that wonderful screen presence that he has in all of his films, it's just that the material is deathly dull, as we maunder through one battle to the next, with Dracula announcing himself every time and turning into a group of bats to kill his adversaries.It could have been something chillingly Gothic, it should have been, but instead it feels like a cheap rip off of Gladiator with a thirst for blood.Very disappointing.",Dracula Untold
22,phd_travel,The story is quite good but a bit too much fighting,8,17 October 2014,"The story is quite a believable and well crafted explanation of how Dracula became Dracula and evokes some sympathy for the hero. It doesn't tread on too familiar ground so it's quite fascinating. The flaw is the battles take up too much of the movie. At least they aren't ""300"" violent. Wonder if it was politically correct to have that kind of Christian Europe vs Ottoman conflict for entertainment given the conflicts going on now. Maybe some smaller scale internal skirmish would have sufficed.Cast is convincing because they aren't too well known. Charles Dance is surprisingly suitable monster thing. Luke Evans as Dracula is a good blend of action hero and family man. He has been in mostly supporting roles before but is capable enough to be the main character. Sara Gaddon isn't very beautiful but she is quite suited to the time and setting of the movie. Dominic Cooper is the villain du jour recently and he is okay as Mehmet.Overall it's quite involving and it's better than you'd think.

23,Wuchakk,Dracula: The dark Superman,7,14 May 2018,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Gary Shore, ""Dracula Untold"" tells the origin of Dracula: In the 15th century Prince Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) must protect his small kingdom of Wallachia (in modern-day Romania) from a Turk warlord (Dominic Cooper) who demands a thousand boys from Wallachia & Transylvania, including Vlad's son. Threatened by the unsurmountable Turk army, Vlad desperately makes a dubious pact with a formidable caged vampire in order to acquire its dark powers and save his family & kingdom. Sarah Gadon plays Vlad's winsome wife.The producers flirted with the idea of ""Dracula Untold"" being part of Universal's Dark Universe; and the epilogue of the movie, set in the modern world, suggests this, insinuating a franchise. This idea was dropped, however, and ""The Mummy"" (2017) became the first official film in the Dark Universe. In any case, ""Dracula Untold"" was fairly successful at the Box Office, making $56.3 million in North America and $217.1 million worldwide against a cost of $70 million.My title blurb pretty much tells you all you need to know: ""Dracula Untold"" is basically the dark Superman of 15th century Eastern Europe where Dracula wields the power to defeat a thousand-man army. If you like the great prologue to Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), you'll probably like this movie, which gives several nods to that forerunner.The film LOOKS awesome and has a fine cast. But unlike ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" it's rapidly paced and doesn't leave much room to breathe; so the characterizations aren't quite deep enough. It's good, but somehow hollow and forgettable. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was perhaps a little too slow while ""Dracula Untold"" is too hurried. I wish the creators found the happy medium between the two because, with just a little bit more time and attention to detail, it could've been great.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot entirely in Northern Ireland.

And I can understand why it looked funny sometimes. For me, I had a lot of trouble with the CGI, just to say it's so low on red stuff, you never see the bite marks and all the effects were done CGI. Don't get me wrong, it all looked stunning especially when the vampires are struck by the sun but it's a bit too much of CGI and particularly the part with the bats is indeed laughable.Dracula and bats they do work together but when Dracula starts looking like some superhero when he's smashing his face into the ground and bats are attacking the Turks it really becomes 100% CGI and was a bit over the top, really, bats destroying a full army...The story I can dig but Luke didn't convince me as Dracula.

The movie add lots of Fantasy and Fiction to the true story in order to entertain it's audiences - I for one am entertained by the film.I like Luke Evans as Vlad Tepes - a fresh face for the character and he's a good, quality actor in my eyes. The rest of the actors a good in this one too - really good in their roles.CGI? - Yes it's in here like most films of today but it's not abused! I think it's well done and in good taste for a film of this type.The story - new, exciting, and a refreshing tale of it's own. The battle a many and a bit graphic - so if that's not your thing then I would tell you ""you might wanna pass on this one film then"".Eye-candy when it comes to the costumes and sets!

27,KineticSeoul,What was the point?,3,27 March 2016,"I personally really found this movie to be a dull sit through. It really doesn't add much to Dracula mythos. I really couldn't think of any good reason why they would try to make a movie such as this except maybe to just cash in. I find it kind of cool when a OP character tries to take on a whole battalion. And there is two scenes of that in this movie. But besides those two scenes, this should have been a straight to DVD movie. There was almost no depth to the story and lacked the entertainment value to keep me focused. And the fight choreography just seemed like something out of a teen romance or straight to DVD movie. What really irritated me is how they portrayed Vlad the Impaler. Just take the origin story of Hitler into movie form and portray him as a family man just trying his best to protect his people and his family. Yeah, that will tick off a lot of people. That is basically what they did with the origin story of Vlad the Impaler. Overall, this movie was a dull through with nothing really interesting, enthralling or entertaining going on.3.6/10",Dracula Untold
28,Hellmant,Takes a classic villain (of movies and literature) and makes him heroic!,6,15 October 2014,"'DRACULA UNTOLD': Three Stars (Out of Five)This reboot to the Universal Monsters film franchises presents an origin story for the classic vampire villain Count Dracula, involving the tale of Vlad the Impaler. It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Gary Shore and written by first time feature film writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (based on Bram Stoker's 1897 novel, 'Dracula'). It stars Luke Evans, as the title character, and costars Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson and Charles Dance. I found it to be mildly entertaining, and somewhat interesting, but ultimately forgettable. The son of Vlad the Impaler, Ingeras (Parkinson), narrates the story; which begins in Transylvania, during the middle ages. Vlad (Evans), a former Turkish soldier, is now prince of Transylvania. He is celebrating Easter, with his people, when the party is interrupted by the Turkish army. They demand 1,000 boys, to be trained in their army, including Vlad's son. Vlad tries to negotiate with the Sultan of Turkey (Cooper), to spare their children, but fails. He then turns to an ancient vampire (Dance), who lives in a cave in the mountains nearby, for help. Vlad makes a deadly deal with the monster; which grants him the powers he needs, to defend his people, but also turns him into a viscous creature himself.Like 'MALEFICENT', from earlier this year, the movie takes a classic villain (of movies and literature) and makes them heroic; by telling an origin story. I'm definitely not against this idea but I don't think either film does it very well. 'MALEFICENT' is more entertaining, and better acted, but this movie could have been a lot worse. It is somewhat involving, at times, and there are some decent action scenes throughout. Hopefully the sequels, and other upcoming Universal Monster flicks, will be better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: youtu.be/N3ywdecCULw",Dracula Untold

30,bowmanblue,The story probably should have remained 'untold',6,18 April 2015,"Okay, so that's a little harsh. 'Dracula Untold' is hardly the worst film ever made. And, yes, I did manage to sit through it feeling mildly entertained. It was just that it didn't really contain anything in it that I hadn't already seen a hundred times before.In the current filmic world we live in where every story has to be retold, remade, or re-imagined, we now get a glimpse at how the legendary vampire, Dracula, became the man (or monster?) he was. What you have is a pretty formulaic action/adventure film that could have been rewritten about anyone really. Drac used to be a warrior. He gets into a spot of bother with an army who want his kingdom's first born sons, so he beefs himself up at the gym and fights them off (either at the gym or allows Charles Dance to turn him into a superpowered monster – I forget).What follows is one CGI created battle after the next. Nothing I haven't seen before. I know this is a minor point and it's probably unfair to slate a film based on its budge, but everything from the action to the landscapes were blatantly digital, it's like watching a 'cut-scene' on a Playstation game.However, greats like '300' did that and most people loved them. At least 300 was a bit different and fun. Dracula Untold just seems like it's nothing new. Plus the characters are pretty bland. Both hero and villain could probably have been played by any actor who looked vaguely heroic/villainous. Plus Drac also has the most wimpy little boy as a son ever featured in a film. You may think that the son of a mighty warlord (even before he became a vampire!) might be a little tougher. You'd be wrong. His constant snivelling and floppy curly hair annoyed me! All in all, Dracula Untold isn't a bad film, it's just not original enough to warrant a viewing from any seasoned film fan (just like I said for 'I Frankenstein!') and doesn't offer anything you haven't seen a hundred times before – and better.And, on a different note, is it just me or is Drac able to make love while wearing leather trousers at all time – watch out for that scene and see if you can see what I mean!",Dracula Untold
31,dromasca,historical pretexts,5,21 June 2019,"I'm not a fan of vampire movies. The genre does not interest me at all, and there must be other good reasons to have me sit in front of a screen to see a movie that belongs to it. One of these reasons is the promise that the movie says something new about the origin of the character, invented by Bram Stoker and modeled on the deformation of Vlad Tepes' historical personality. It's what 'Dracula Untold' promised ('Untold' like in the untold story). A promise that is far from accomplished. The film directed by Gary Shore is an acceptable entertainment film, not a masterpiece and not as bad as it could have been.Historically, everything is a mess. Vlad is moved from Wallachia to Transylvania, the Cozia monastery (also moved over the mountains) becomes a fortress but with walls painted on the outside as in Bucovina, nothing in the film resembles Transylvania from then or now, which is no wonder as filming was made in Northern Ireland, and the cinematography is more like that of 'Lord of the Rings'. But there are pleasant surprises also. If we put aside any historical pretext, Vlad is portrayed as a charismatic and moral character, ready to sacrifice his humanity to save his country. The lead role actor, Luke Evans, is very good, making to look credible some of the most incredible scenes. After all, we are in an imaginary world where comics style meets vampire stories on big screens with computer graphics.Director Gary Shore (well-known from advertising films) is at his first feature film, but this is not felt at any time. He builds the story intelligently, focusing on the main character and his evolution. The film has rhythm and the graphic effects are of good quality. The end even hints to a possible sequel, although I have not heard about one having been produced or in plans. The historical pretext is totally missed, the film does not say anything about the history behind the Dracula historical character, possibly just suggesting an alternative to the origin of Bram Stoker's fictional character. The line in the end credits that officially informs us that the characters and action of the film have nothing to do with real characters, now or in history, has never been more true.",Dracula Untold
32,Cineanalyst,Batman Begins,4,10 July 2018,"Despite the critical panning of ""The Mummy"" (2017), Universal's official launching of its Dark Universe, I think they were wise to not begin the series with this one, ""Dracula Untold,"" although they've flirted with doing so. Not only is it a complete departure from Bram Stoker's novel and the prior Universal monster movies, which began with 1931's ""Dracula,"" or that it's so devoid of authenticity for the historical Vlad the Impaler or reality in general, but, worse yet, it's such a blatant and largely failed ploy at co-opting the formulae of superhero movies, such as the Dark Knight trilogy, but especially the Marvel Cinematic Universe, whose success has become the envy of all Hollywood. And, from the perspective of ignorant racist vilification, ""Dracula Untold"" is essentially a toned-down, one-man versus ""the other"" version of ""300"" (2006).I've seen over 50 Dracula-related movies now since reading Stoker's book, and it's baffling how far removed some of the mainstream tendencies in depictions of the titular character have come, to the point that essentially nothing in ""Dracula Untold"" besides the names and locations can be traced back to Stoker. I suspect at least some of the primary filmmakers involved didn't even read the book; if they did, they obviously needn't have bothered, because they didn't use it. What they obviously did, however, was view other Dracula movies, as well as the superhero ones. Two trends in Dracula movies, which owe next to nothing to Stoker, and which I've found especially irritating are the transformation of Dracula into a romantic and sympathetic figure, often through the device of a reincarnation romance, and the greater assertion of and focus upon Dracula having been the historical Vlad the Impaler. Stoker's ""Dracula"" owes its title and a couple sentences of speculation made by Van Helsing to the Vlad connection, and the earliest movie I know to even mention it is the Turkish adaptation, ""Drakula Istanbul'da"" (1953). Had Stoker cared to dwell as much as the movies have upon his character's origins, he may've learned that Vlad was the Prince of Wallachia, an entirely different country than Transylvania.For Stoker, Dracula was also plainly a barer of immorality and even a surrogate for unmentioned venereal disease. A 1974 TV movie, mistitled ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" by Dan Curtis first combined Vlad with a reincarnation romance, a trope that had already been employed by Curtis in his ""Dark Shadows"" TV series, as well as in the Dracula-esque blaxploitation flick ""Blacula"" (1972). If not the reincarnation romance, the portrayal of Dracula as a sympathetic romantic figure has persisted since in ""The Great Love of Count Dracula"" (1973), ""Dracula and Son"" (1976), ""Nosferatu"" (1979), ""Nosferatu in Venice"" (1988), the 1992 ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" ""Dracula Rising"" (1993) and other Dracula, as well as numerous other vampire, movies.Unfortunately, ""Dracula Untold"" rehashes both of these threads and puts them in a superhero origins story. Vlad becomes vampire to save family, he rather effortlessly defeats entire armies of Turks, struggles to avoid eternal damnation as vampire, but loses wife in tragic slow-motion sequence, Vlad saves son but cue another slow-motion sequence somewhere and, centuries later, Vlad sees Mina, the twin reincarnation of his dead wife, played by the same actress. And, if copying other Dracula movies and superhero movies weren't enough, they throw in Tywin Lannister informing us that the games have begun. As mindless popcorn fare, ""Dracula Untold"" isn't entirely awful, but with that setup, I'm not excited for a sequel.(Mirror Note: Dracula's reflection is seen in a sword as he kills Turks in battle. As this was during the movie's invented period where Vlad was undead but not yet condemned to an eternity as a vampire, it may be supposed that he would later not have a reflection, as Dracula shouldn't, but Stoker's Dracula also wasn't harmed by silver or sunlight, so whatever....)",Dracula Untold

Of course, this is not the best actioneer of the year, but it's very well done one. Settings are good, special effects were really nice, acting was very solid for this material - Luke Evans is perfectly cast as our main hero, and Charles Dance is always someone to look at and to hear to. Others were OK, even Dominic Cooper didn't disappoint, who for me is an annoying actor in general, i'm not really like him as an actor, probably the only actor which i kinda dislike in general. Luckily, he's not a star in here and does a nice job in playing our main villain. Overall, ""Dracula Untold"" is not a Bram Stoker's fateful adaptation of the material.

37,The-Sarkologist,A rather boring Dracula prequel,3,4 October 2014,"Have you ever been to a movie where the trailers really grab you and then discover that you have already seen all of the decent scenes? Quite a lot would probably be your reply, and I know that it would be mine as well. Well, this film, for me at least, was one of those films. The effects were pretty good but other than that I really didn't like it. In fact, I would probably go as far to say that I found it really boring (though maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I have moved one seat across because I ended up sitting next to one of those really annoying people that simply insist on taking up as much space as possible). Once again we have a retelling of the Dracula story with much better special effects than the previous one, however this is also one of those movies that essentially sets the scene for the later story (as immortalised in Bram Stoker's book). Basically the film is set during the Turkish invasion of Eastern Europe and even though Vlad initially drove the Turks out of his land, he still is paying tribute to them (which I found odd because I had the impression that he had defeated them, and I feel that they should have got rid of the whole tribute scene). They then demand a thousand children (including Vlad's own son) as tribute and that sets the legendary impailer on his course to make a deal with the powers of darkness to save his land (and his family). I won't go much deeper into the story than that, except that it does deal with the question of whether the means does justify the ends (and it suggests that it doesn't because even though the film isn't a tragedy per se, it still tells us that Vlad damns himself by making that deal). In fact we are reminded a number of times during the film that he did not make the deal for his own purposes but so that he might save his people, and while he does end up driving out the Turks (no spoiler needed there because I am sure we all know what to expect in relation to that part of the film) he condemns himself to eternal damnation in the form of a vampire. As I said, I wasn't really all that impressed with the film. There seemed to be too many stretches were nothing seems to be happening, and I also wonder why he did not destroy many more Turks at night, but had to wait for the last minute to say 'hey, I haven't got much time, so I better do it all now). It was also incredibly predictable (though since it is a 'prequel' we all know where it ends anyway) in that I worked out what was going to happen as soon as the elder vampire opened his mouth. So, in the end, I would probably suggest that unless you really, really, like vampire movies (which I don't) then there are probably better things to spend your money on.",Dracula Untold

39,sol-,Becoming Dracula,6,8 October 2016,"Desperate to protect his kingdom, an East European prince makes a pact with a vampire that results in him becoming a creature of the night in this big budget Dracula origins tale. Providing a background for Bram Stoker's iconic character is a fairly novel idea and the film's best asset is the novelty of having a sympathetic, flawed and very human Dracula at the heart of things. The film is not especially well assembled though. It is a slick-looking production for sure, with moody skies, detailed sets and solid special effects, however, everything is played so melodramatically that the film often feels like soap opera. Sarah Gadon is a talented actress, but none of the principle cast members are particularly effective in their roles - except for Charles Dance who offers a refreshingly unusual yet still sinister take on Nosferatu, playing the master vampire who Dracula makes the pact with. The epilogue works particularly well due to Dance's presence and it is a bit of a shame that he is not more prominently featured throughout as the overall horror content proves surprisingly slim here. Awesome as it is to have Dracula portrayed as a loving father for a change, and a victim of temptation, the film negates a lot of opportunity to show much he changes due to the pact with bloodsucking kept a minimum. Still, 'Dracula Untold' is an interesting addition to the vampire canon even if it is not all that it could have been.",Dracula Untold
40,filipemanuelneto,A poor excuse to make a vampire movie,4,21 November 2016,"Sometimes Hollywood likes to fool the public and sell or promote a movie in a way that looks like one thing, but it's quite another. That was the case with this movie. The public expecting a horror film encountered an adventure film; The audience waiting for a film around the true story of Vlad the Impaler (the historical character who inspired the creation of Bram Stoker's horror character) found a mixture of Vlad + Dracula, spiced with the imaginative and unrealistic traits that Hollywood likes to use. It turns out that mixing reality with fiction in such an express way usually gives bad results. It's like a salad where someone has put the wrong sauce: tastes bad and is inedible.What this film did in practice was to appropriate the names of people who actually existed and places we could actually visit to spice up the old Dracula legend, already described and revisited by countless films. The ""cooks"" on duty were Gary Shore, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, three newcomers who wanted to make their first movie and decided to bet on a blockbuster Dracula. Unfortunately for the freshmen, it lacked a reason, a differential, because almost all the horror directors and writers have already done something with vampires. So, they had to create a pretext for a new movie, however stingy it might be. The millions made available by Universal, who sponsored this abortion, did the rest and provided the only good thing about this film: the special, visual and sound effects, that fill almost the entire movie to the point of stifling the script itself. But do not think that we have pity on the script! It's a terrible and predictable script that mixes up and distorts reliable historical data, copying and badly pasting it in a tangle of absurdities and clichés. The actors' performance was not great either, but we believe that the guilt wasn't the cast (headed by Luke Evans, who is far from being a rookie) but probably the lack of a skilled director, who can guide the actors accurately while, at the same time, demands a minimally decent text from the writers.We, the Portuguese, have a popular saying that says, more or less, that the shoemaker cannot play the guitar. This means that each person must do what he knows, according to his abilities. This movie was doomed to failure from the moment they put an inexperienced team behind. If sometimes a hard-working director or writer feels trouble working with a blockbuster, what could we expect from people who have never directed a movie or written a screenplay before?",Dracula Untold

The storyline wasn't that great, along with the acting which also let the movie down and I didn't really find the individual characters that interesting it seemed to jump in at the deep end without much explanation. Its a whole new look to the Dracula concept which did have some clever shots but the tone was quite glum. I'm used to Dracula being a dark evil character, not a man whose fighting for justice and his family. He really does put his new Dracula powers to good use, by taking out huge armies with bats and amazing fighting skills but I was left feeling pretty empty at the end. I didn't get why the two sides were fighting against each other and why the baddie, played by Dominic Cooper, wanted his son, but thats because I stopped paying attention after while. Its not the greatest take on the all time classic but it's a watchable film because of its epic action scenes. Average!Round-Up: Although I didn't really enjoy this film, it really did make a healthy profit at the box office. I would have liked to see a couple of top actors starring alongside Luke Evans and I honestly can't see were the whole $70million budget went. I was also expecting some really gory moments but it was more of an barbaric movie with more sword action than blood. There's obviously a certain audience which appeal to movies in this genre and would have really enjoyed this movie, but I personally didn't find it that entertaining and I lost interest after a while.Budget: $70million Worldwide Gross: $215.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Dracula based movies about a man who decides to get bitten so he can gain powers to fight against evil to protect his family. 4/10",Dracula Untold
42,Tweetienator,Super-Dracula,4,3 October 2021,"Dracula is a mixed bag for me - the production, cinematography, acting and so on is good but the story itself is, well, belongs rather to the universe of Marvel or DC - a superhero vampire killing thousands and thousands of enemies...

44,Vartiainen,"Enjoyable, but misrepresents its source material",6,22 June 2020,"Dracula Untold was supposed to be the first film in Universal's Dark Universe, which would bring together old movie monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Invisible Man and the Mummy. I guess that they're still trying to do that to some degree, but this really wasn't the opening film they wanted.Dracula Untold is yet another retelling of the story of Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler, if you prefer. This time he's played by Luke Evans and the gist of his character is that he's trying to do what's best for his people, the Transylvanians. Even if that means dealing with a literal source of primordial evil. You can all see where this is going.To the film's credit, it looks great. The production value is there on the screen, from the costumes to the locations to the CGI involved. It utilizes its budget well and I have no complaints about how it looks. Luke Evans is also enjoyable, as is Charles Dance in his role, which I shall not spoil.That being said, you're not supposed to make Dracula a good guy. Especially not like this. I could buy him as a noble demon. A ruthless, bloodthirsty monster, who nevertheless has a code of conduct and might even believe that innocents should be spared where possible. Netflix's recent Castlevania series springs to mind. But making him an outright good guy, who simply falls victim to his circumstances. No, that's not Dracula. At least, not to me.Plus there are some really bad plot holes. Especially concerning characters teleporting around to be where the plot needs them to be. Shoddy editing at the very least, if not outright bad storytelling.Still, it is a spectacle. A good-looking spectacle.",Dracula Untold

But at times it feels less like a vampire story, and more like a superhero origin story. The effects are pretty descent, but the film at times it does not take seriously, but it never gets to annoying like I,Frankenstein did.Luke Evans gives a pretty real performance, I like the way he humanizes Dracula, he never once camps it up. The villains are alright but I did not get much out of them. I like it as much has Van Helsing(2004), but like it a lot more then I, Frankenstein, and although I would not consider it a great film, but I could sit through it more then that film.",Dracula Untold

What they created was a fantasy action film that looks like Universal were trying to make their own version of 300, one nation making an unreasonable demand to another, and has a smaller nation fighting a growing element. The opening was pretty much copying the visual style of that film with a voiceover expanding the history. And for a 300 copy it is one of the better ones because it visual design, especially when Vlad goes into the vampire's cave, and had some solid action sequences. It is a shame that the film went for an R-rating because it would have offered a lot of bloody. For what it is is a passable fantasy romp.",Dracula Untold

This is an origin/reboot of the Dracula story. The world's most famous vampire story, for the uninformed or forgetful, is based on a true person named Vlad Tepes, who was a prince in the 1490's that would impale his enemies, as a warning to others. He was nicknamed, Vlad the Impaler. As far as I know, he did not actually drink blood but he would bathe in it. Anyway, Luke plays Vlad, a Transylvanian prince, that is attacked by Dominic, the leader of the conquering Turks. Dominic needs some fresh troops to replace his army and demands Luke to hand over 1,000 young boys, including Luke's own son. That doesn't sit very well with Luke so he seeks out some supernatural help from Charles, a recluse that lives in a cave. Luke is granted the powers of a vampire and given a loop hole; if he does not drink human blood for 3 days, then he will return to being a normal human. But if he does indulge his hunger, then he will be a vampire forever. Want to take any bets on which one happens? Sarah plays Luke's wife. There is some nice action scenes and it ends as if there will be sequels in the future. I saw it in the IMAX version and it looked good. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, disturbing images and sexuality-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 32 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy this on Blu-Ray.",Dracula Untold

49,estebangonzalez10,So what exactly is untold about Dracula here?,3,13 November 2014,"""My father was a great man, a hero, so they say. But sometimes the world doesn't need another hero, sometimes what it needs is a monster.""If you are going to make a film about the origins of one of Hollywood's most fearful monsters then you better have a solid script that focuses on the character development of Dracula rather than over-stuff the film with special effects and action scenes. Director Gary Shore may have tried to give us an origin story, and he even gave it the title Dracula Untold, but what he really does is deliver another clichéd and familiar action film. We really don't learn anything new about this classic character in the film other than the fact that he was a good fighter and a loving family man who sacrificed himself to protect the people he cared for. I would argue there isn't much of a unique idea in that premise and that the title untold is a bit deceiving. There just isn't anything unique or appealing about this character to claim that you are delivering an origin story. The only thing Shore tries to do here is humanize the monster and make him seem engaging. Instead of trying to focus on the character however, Dracula Untold delivers one action scene after another relying on its computer generated special effects. The film might captivate some audiences who are looking for a fun time, but there is nothing memorable or legendary about it. I can imagine a documentarian making a film about Hollywood's portrayal of Dracula and mentioning all the films that have centered on this monster but leaving this unremarkable film out of the list simply because it is easy to forget and it never seems to be a film about Dracula really. You can add Dracula Untold to the never ending list of tiresome and uninterestingly generic vampire films. The only pleasure I got from Dracula Untold was that it made me feel good about my decision of not having seen I Frankenstein. The script for Dracula Untold is probably responsible for the failure of the film because the cast did a pretty decent job. I thought Luke Evans delivered an interesting performance. He has some entertaining action sequences and looks the part as well. Dominic Cooper might not be menacing in this film but he gave a decent performance. Sarah Godon was beautiful as Dracula's wife and inspiration. I did't have an issue with the performances at all, but it was mostly the overload of action scenes that didn't manage to keep me interested. They seldom do (Hercules might be the only exception this year and it wasn't a film I was crazy about either). I didn't care too much for the CGI either so there was really very little this film had to offer me. I was just disengaged with the story and found it overly generic and too familiar. If you are going to give your film the title of Dracula Untold, you might as well give us something original and unique that hasn't actually been told before.",Dracula Untold

51,arthur_tafero,Best Vampire Movie since the Original,6,17 March 2019,"I generally abhor vampire and zombie films. I enjoyed the original Night of the Living Dead and all sequels since then are nowhere nearly as good. I also enjoyed the original Dracula with Bela Lugosi, and no remake ever since has been as good...that is, until now. The historical and legendary mix of this Dracula gives a fairly accurate account of Count Dracula, also known as Vlad the Impaler. The production values and CGI for this film is first-rate, and so are the performances of the lead actors. The real strength of this film, however, comes from the very talented screenwriters and director, who have made a classic for the ages.
The tenor of the film is quite Shakespearean, and would qualify for one of the Bard's better tragedies. There is also a wonderful twist at the end that works perfectly and sets up the inevitable sequel (don't all films of this genre have to do that?). I almost never view these types of films because i know I will be easily disappointed; but I was not disappointed with this gem.",Dracula Untold

53,3xHCCH,An Adequately Entertaining Alternate Origin Story,5,18 October 2014,"This re-imagined origin of the blood-sucking vampire Dracula is based on a real historical character Vlad the Impaler. He is a valiant prince of Transylvania. The cruel Sultan Mehmed of Turkey demands from Vlad 1,000 male children to join his ruthless army, and that should include Vlad's only son. Pushed to the wall to defend his son and people, Vlad was forced to turn to the dark side. He sought the powerful intercession of the Master Vampire to turn himself into a monster which could strike extreme fear in his enemies in order to overcome and defeat them.This film has a historical graphic novel look and feel, like many popular films nowadays, much like the ""300"" films. The computer- generated effects were quite well done. The battle scenes were quite stylishly shot, without excessive blood and gore. There are also some nifty-looking fantasy shots, like the Master Vampire's memorable tongue scene. The vampire transformation scenes were also quite effective. Luke Evans has a nobility in his look and stance that makes him a good choice for this interpretation of Vlad. Vlad here is a good man who had to sacrifice his own soul to the devil in order to save his family and country, and Evans was able to give a balanced portrayal of this conflicted character. He recently had an intense turn in the small slasher film ""No One Lives"", and that intensity also served him well here as Vlad. We had seen this Welsh actor in more mainstream hit films like the last ""Fast and Furious"" film, as well as the last ""Hobbit"" film, so his career is well on the rise.The rest of the supporting actors did their best on what basically were one-dimensional roles. The beautiful wife MIrena as played by the ravishing Sarah Gadon is ever loving and loyal. The Sultan as played by a sinister Dominic Cooper is brutish and violent. It was very good to see two members of the Game of Thrones cast in this film. The formidable Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister on GoT) played the Master Vampire as pure evil. Young Art Parkinson (Rickon Stark on GoT) played Vlad's son Ingeras.As a whole this film was adequately diverting and entertaining, though not exactly outstanding in any particular way. I do hope this Dracula gets the sequel it promised at the end of this film. I admit I am curious on how this new Dracula would fare as a good guy in more modern times. 5/10.",Dracula Untold
54,TdSmth5,A great surprise,8,1 February 2015,"In a voiced-over intro we learn that the Turks during their empire had the habit of taking male children from their conquered lands to grow up as soldiers for the empire. One of these children was Vlad Tepes who became an extraordinary soldier and come to be known as Vlad the Impaler. He became close, like a brother, to one important Turk. Eventually, he returns to his family and his little domain where he's a prince. Soon enough the Turks arrive and demand 1000 boys including his son. He's also accused of killing from Turks in the area.Earlier we learned that intrigued by the remains of some dead Turks Vlad and his friends climbed a mountain. There he encountered a creature. Now he has a few days to deliver the boys. Knowing that up in the mountain is something powerful enough to kill Turks he goes up there and meets the vampire. It suggests a deal. It can offer him the power to kill Turks, to regenerate, if he's willing to drink the vampire's blood. In a couple of days he will have to start to feed on human blood. At that point, the vampire will be freed from his condition.Vlad agrees and destroys Turks. He thinks he can defeat them before he needs to feed. Of course he can only fight during the night, he can't tolerate silver or the sun. The Turks keep sending wave and wave of armies after him and his people, who hide in a monastery, where the monks actually turn against him. And the Turks end up outsmarting him, capturing his wife and son. That's when he's forced to take the most difficult of decisions. But he's also a bright guy and comes up with a good idea to decimate the Turks leading to a confrontation with the sultan.Dracula Untold is so much more than the trailer promised. It not some mindless CGI battle movie that happens to have Dracula as the central character, which is what I was expecting. There's a lot of history, there's a lot of literature, there's a lot of heart. I'm not into poetry but this movie features a wonderful and mind-blowing little poem relevant to the story. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of other meaningful characters. The movie doesn't even manage to make the nemesis stand out. The master vampire is also miscast. But the most important strength of this movie is something that no other Dracula movie has done--make Dracula the hero. Dracula is my favorite ""monster"" and in this movie he's far more human than monster. Still, in every Dracula and vampire movie it's Dracula or the vampire who is the villain. And in every movie you root for him and not the humans. And in every movie he ends up defeated. Finally, in Dracula Untold you're meant to root for Dracula. In that regard at least this movie is downright revolutionary. The story is also more elaborate than you would expect. At several occasions I found myself thinking that the movie would take this or that expected turn and end on some obvious note. But it never did. It managed to surprise me until the very end.",Dracula Untold
55,Spondonman,Like a Batty Hobbit,7,22 February 2015,"Not knowing the minutiae of the Vlad The Bad history I can only guess the truth has been falsified for the sole purpose of creating a fantasy fiction film with the ultimate aim of financial gain. I've never heard of such a thing before - I've just been watching a film with the main character morphing into thousands of bats and vice versa and I thought this was all well detailed as solid fact in the history books. What a swizz!Medieval Prince Vlad - played by Luke Evans fresh from Hobbit 3 - who is self-styled The Impaler, thinks up a novel way to try to save his family and his people from the onslaught of the naughty Turks by well, selling his soul to the Devilish. A lot of people nowadays probably would do that for a pack of cigarettes or a good mobile connection. Evans is OK even if on the insipid side for such a virulent character, but Charles Dance has found his most unlife-like role to date; roll on Drac's Back! Maybe the biggest preloaded spoiler possible with this movie: whatever they do in here everyone knows that in our Universe Vlad becomes a vampire, so his ""survival"" is guaranteed, come what cgi cartoon mayhem is thrown at him and the rest of us. I idly wondered if the millions of bats conjured up by Vlad would kill the millions of attacking Turks by dropping millions of tons of guano onto their hapless heads – after all, isn't that what happened in reality? There were a few gruesome cgi bits dreamed up by the usual movie psychos, none of which were a big problem to me (and little kids will probably erm lap it all up) – I had more of a problem with the sound quality, or lack of. I hope all of the actors had a good supply of Strepsils handy to be able to gutturally whisper for so long - maybe it would've been better titled as Dracula Ungrowled.So just between us, bat to man, it's all nonsense, like all Dracula films have always been and always will be. It was a well-made and enjoyable, concise and imaginative romp and if there's a new rebooting of the franchise by Universal I only hope erm it carries on in this vein.",Dracula Untold
56,Seraphion,"Dracula, but where's the scary part?",6,11 October 2014,"1442; Prince Vlad Dracula of Transylvania was part of the enforced thousand boys military draft into the Turkish army where he became a ferocious warrior with the nickname 'Vlad the Impaler'. Now ten years since returning, he has led his kingdom in peace and prosperity albeit paying tax to the Turks. One day while investigating a dead Turk scout, he encounters a demonic creature but manages to escape. A monk reveals the creature to be an ancient vampire. He asks the monk to keep it a secret. An emissary of the Turkish Sultan Mehmet II comes and once again demands a thousand boys to fill the ranks of the Turkish army. Vlad reluctantly obeys and delivers his son Ingeras as the first. But when the Turkish general who's picking up Ingeras mocks him, Vlad changes his mind and slays the Turkish contingent. His advisers tell him that by this, war will soon come upon them and he can't protect his people. Vlad then resorts to the vampire for more strength. The vampire gives Vlad a deal; he tastes the vampire's powers, and weaknesses, for three days as long as he can resist the thirst for human blood. If before three days he drinks human blood, he will forever be a vampire. He returns just in time when a batch of Turkish army attacks. He dismisses his troops saying he'll go negotiate with the enemy. But with his new powers he single-handedly decimates the Turks. Knowing Mehmet will come with a bigger force, Vlad takes his people to refuge in the monastery. The next day, suspected Vlad when he avoids sunlight, a monk uncovers Vlad's nature and the people try to burn him in a shack. Vlad walks out the flames and questions his people's loyalty. The next day nearing dawn, Mehmet attacks with a huge force. Vlad uses his powers and targets Mehmet when sees him. Turns out, Mehmet uses a double to distract Vlad while the Turks sneak into the monastery and kidnaps Ingeras, throwing Vlad's wife Mirena from the monastery tower. Vlad arrives too late and he can't save Mirena. But Mirena offers him her blood, saying that her life is over but their son's isn't. Vlad grants Mirena's wish and then uses his powers to control the clouds to cover the newly risen sun. He then offers his blood to his people, promising them revenge. With the new force Vlad storms into Mehmet's compound the next day. The Turks is no match for the new vampire army. But when Vlad finds Ingeras, the vampires turn against him and demands Ingeras' blood. Luckily the monk comes and takes away Ingeras to the safety of the monastery.The story sure does live the movie's billing as an action flick, which is quite a new touch in approaching the Bram Stoker's classic horror novel. As one that was personally amazed by Gary Oldman's acting in the classic 1992 movie, I think this movie did enough justice story-wise to be put as a prequel to the Keanu Reeves movie. The epilogue nicely teases to that direction. The reinterpretation of who Dracula serves in the crusades, from being a Crusader to being a Turkish knight, is neatly done and makes the dramatization more substantial. The deeper focus on Vlad's legendary notoriety as the Impaler is also a nice way to put in the horror touch.However I also think that this movie leaves out too much of the horror aspect, the very aspect from which the Dracula story gained it's fame. There's literally no scary scene and no horrifying imagery to do the horror legacy some justice. This enables the movie to gain a PG-13 rating and reach a wider audience, yet it also quite disappoints the older fans of the Dracula story and the fans of vampire stories in general, especially those who are disenfranchised by the 'de-horroring' of vampires in recent years' teen movies. It's quite unfortunate for me because this movie has so much room for horror aspect. Instead it kind of slowed down the horror tendencies, making the vampire bites a lot less scary with less blood drips or scarier biting moves.The action side doesn't really help to fill what the omitted horror side lacks. First I have to admit that yes, the action side uses the visual effects on the crowded war scenes very well, and it uses the close ups camera nicely on the close up fights. But the aim at PG-13 rating and this movie being the director Gary Shore's first feature film work left this movie with less impressive action moves.The acting overall for me is an okay one. Luke Evans did well understanding the story's being focused mostly on his character, doing very well on those close up shots face expressions and action take. Dominic Cooper really used his experience playing antagonists here well enough, although his acting acting lacks better expressions. Sarah Gadon gives the romance side adequate live to her character, just enough to keep the romance in line with the whole story.My verdict will be a 6 out of 10 score for Drcula Untold (2014). It may be disappointment without the signature horror that Dracula is heavily associated to, but it's a nice take on a prequel to the story.",Dracula Untold
57,rgkarim,CGI Dominated Battles and Much Different Twist,7,11 October 2014,"Dracula. It is a legendary tale that has been told throughout the ages in form or another. Many movies have focused on the original player, with the seductive glare that can woo any woman into doingwhatever it is he plans to do. Most of these renditions have been the same formula, the vampire lord pining over a woman only to be stopped just by someone. Sure there have been a few twists thrown into the mix, helping to adapt him into the modern era, some of which have been good, and some that let's face it have tanked. This weekend, yet another spin on the tale has been released, promising to bring action that this denizen of the night hasn't had in a while. Did it work? Read on to find out. So picture it, medieval Transylvania in the time when the Turks were trying to invade the world in the name of their glorious Sultan. Standing in their way is a handful of soldiers, whose leader is an elite trained soldier that once was a salve to the very beast. Wait a minute doesn't this sound like a movie we've already seen before? One with Greek soldiers standing in the way of the Turks? Well don't worry this movie isn't 300, but it has a lot of similar elements that may have been the motivation for this movie. Let's start with the action first. Dracula Untold is supposedly an action/adventure, and in a way it is. A creative still frame opening introduces the tale leading us to a rather bland opening. Yet when the trouble starts and the bad guys are on our doorsteps, the boss comes out to play. The first fight is an impressive display of sword fighting, a fast paced version of a Lord of the Rings fight that is fairly short in the grand scheme of things. Not to worry it's only the first battle, surely the rest of the movie will give us our money's worth. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Dracula Untold's fights are rather short lived, each one serving as another medium to test the lord of the night's powers. The graphics are impressive, but the fighting is rather simple, and one sided to the point that it becomes a bore. Sure the first fight with super powers was good for me, the action designed more like 300's battles, minus the slow motion slashing and decapitation. I wanted more fights like this one, though with some better camera work, but the movie became nothing more than again a CGI wonderland where artificial bats swarmed the screen. Was it fun? Yes. Was it worth the money? Not really, though the big screen gladly welcomed the deep sounds and high definition death. So the action wasn't top notch, but maybe there is something else to this movie. Well let's talk about the story Dracula Untold. I can say this tale is one of the more unique spins on his story, blending elements of many films to craft a decent adventure. This film has sort of a dark justice feel to it, with Dracula obtaining his powers for a noble cause of protecting his family, which the trailers have already told you. Yet that simplistic story has more layers to it, evolving as more situations unfold. You can see a lot of the revelations happening a mile a way, but path to getting there is filled with a few twists that may surprise you. Yet what really grabbed my attention was the internal battle between Dracula, or Vlad, and his curse. You know the inevitable ending, but you just don't know when he is going to reach that breaking point. In this film, the director has captured the struggle of facing off the curse, and just how tempting the world can be when you are denied certain things. Alone this struggle can be boring, and a little drawn out, but when overlaid with the main tale, it becomes a powerful combination that kept me enthralled in an otherwise ridiculous story. Well it was that and the fact that you never quite know how dark they would take the film. So what else does this film have in store? In truth the acting is well done, each of the merry band of knights and maidens a strong fit for the film. Of course most of the screen time is on the big cheese himself Dracula, played by Luke Evans. Evans does a nice job with his role, as he essentially plays Bard with more edge. He keeps his emotions in check and does a nice job balancing his work. His wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) is a lovely supporting character and is second on the screen time. She is beautiful, smart, and not annoying as Hollywood makes some of their female leads out to be, and Gadon did a great job playing the part. Why I had hoped for a little more girl power, she did a great job doing her part for the war. Again the rest of the cast does a solid job for the most part, but it's time to wrap this up before my next film starts. Dracula Untold is not a bad tale, with some well-designed action, a unique twist to the plot, and a good variety of elements to keep things interesting. However, the action is short lived, the moves are a bit stale, and there are a few plot elements that are a bit stretched or short sighted to say it is a must see in theaters. Make a note that this is a bloody movie, that there are close-ups of bloody kills and death that may not be for those with weak constitutions. The fact that the movie is dark and loud too, might be an indication not to bring babies, or other young adults to the theaters. Overall, my scores are:Action/Adventure/Horror: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.5",Dracula Untold
58,rannynm,An Intense Love Story,9,10 October 2014,"Dracula Untold is an intense love story that changes everything we know about the world's most famous vampire. Dracula undergoes a complete makeover, trading his creepy castle in for a palace fit for a king. That's right, Dracula better known as ""Vlad the Impaler"" is a Slavic prince and protector of his people. This movie tries to stay true to some of the history behind the classic story of Dracula which is interesting, but also confusing. Vlad, played by Luke Evans is a prince who may be brutal on the battlefield, but is adored by his citizens. When war with a neighboring nation seems unavoidable he is forced to do something that will change his life forever. He locates a great evil that will give him super speed, strength, and the ability to fly. He will get these powers and many more for three days if he can resist the urge to drink human blood, but if he gives in he will stay like this for the rest of eternity. The deal seems simple at the time but the safety of Vlad's people and family is at risk. Now it's up to him to protect himself and those he loves from the war.My favorite thing about this film is definitely the special effects. They make the movie less scary and more action packed and thrilling. I also like how unpredictable the movie is. You never know exactly what was going to next and, it is still fun watching it all play out. The most entertaining character in the entire movie is the ""master vampire"" played by Charles Dance. He makes a lasting impression on the audience because of how he makes his character scary, but interesting. He also plays a very important role in the storyline. My favorite part of the movie is when Dracula unleashes his powers on an entire army for the first time. This scene is jaw-dropping due to the animation and special effects. Also, the music adds excitement to the movie. I recommend Dracula Untold for ages 14 to 18 because of some more mature scenes and I give it 5 out of 5 stars.

As imagined by screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, the titular bloodsucker begins as a 15th century Transylvanian prince named Vlad who trades his soul for the dark side in order to protect his family and his kingdom from the armies of the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II. To be sure, their inspiration is rooted in history – the real historical figure of Vlad the Impaler was indeed taken by the Turks as a young boy and trained to kill without question or reason.After a brief prologue establishing this crucial backstory, Welsh actor Luke Evans inhabits the role of the glowering anti-hero, weary of war and desiring only of peace. And yet that dream is shattered when his uneasy truce with the far-numerous Turks is disrupted one day by the Sultan's demand for one thousand youths to join his army, including, we may add, Vlad's own son Ingeras (Art Parkinson). Desperate for a way out, Vlad turns to the evil that he knows resides within Broken Tooth Mountain (so named after the Universal Studios theme park attraction) – a Nosferatu-like demon (Charles Dance) who offers him a drink of his blood for superhuman strength.The price? If he can resist drinking human blood in three days, Vlad will get to return to human form. What happens after is a lot of CGI, some (especially the overhead shots of the scale of the Turkish invasion) impressive and others (like the mano-a-thousands shots of Count Dracula's vanquishing an entire army) less so. Yes, since the outcome is pretty much known, much of the film fills itself with ostensibly CGI-enhanced Lord-of-the-Rings-style battle sequences that see Vlad alternate between human and bat form to sweep like a tornado through his opponents or command a whole colony of them just by waving his hands.For obvious reasons, most of these sequences take place at night, but the nocturnal setting also means that the action often descends into murky chaos, such that what happens on screen often comes off as a blur – and that is even on an IMAX supersized screen. Cynics will also no doubt find fault with the bloodlessness of these sequences, which despite boasting the stylish gloom of HBO's 'Game of Thrones', is PG13 demure in order to ensure accessibility to a younger audience. But once you accept that this is no more than a glorified B-movie, you'll learn to appreciate its pleasures a lot more.Evans, for instance, makes for a surprisingly engaging lead in the titular role. Having proved his charisma in supporting roles such as 'Fast and Furious 6' and 'The Hobbit', he finally gets the chance to anchor a film from start to end, and acquits himself handsomely with a compelling portrayal of a man who must learn just how much of his own mortality he is willing to sacrifice in order to save the ones he saves. Amidst the noisy battles, Evans shares a couple of nice intimate scenes with Sarah Gadon, who plays his wife Mirena, and the chemistry between them builds to a heartbreaking finale that offers as good a reason as any for his subsequent – and inevitable transformation.On his part, veteran commercials director turned first-time feature helmer Gary Shore fairs pretty well by keeping the proceedings lean and tight, with much of the storytelling in action rather than words. Besides tapping on cinematographer John Schwartzmann for some lush widescreen shots of Ireland, Shore also employs different stylistic flourishes to enliven the on screen action, which in itself still gets your heart thumping – despite some clearly slapdash CGI especially in the depiction of them carnivorous creatures. It isn't particularly inspired, but in the context of a diverting fantasy- horror, Shore's raw instincts as a filmmaker do suffice.And so if approached from the mentality that 'it could be much worse', 'Dracula Untold' actually stands on its own as an enjoyable piece of hokum. Pretending that it is anything more takes away the cruder pleasures it offers, and of course sets it up as something that it probably never intended to be in the first place. That said, it does end on a pretty exciting note – a coda set in present day sees Vlad encountering his seemingly reincarnated wife Mirena, with Dance's malevolent character in close pursuit and intoning the last four words for a sequel we must say we are quite excited to see: ""let the games begin"".",Dracula Untold
60,Muhammad_Rafeeq,( American B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10,9,10 March 2020,"I liked this movie a lot. It is more than a Dracula movie. It is also about love, loyalty, war and peace, faith, power and human nature in general. An original and fresh approach, away from the paved paths, make this a one of a kind Dracula film. Some people rate this movie very low because they consider it to be historically inaccurate. Come on, are there any accurate movies about vampires? Also, some people rate this movie very low because they view it as islamophobic. That is impossible, because as I mentioned before, it is also about war and war is never wrong or right. Just watch it with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.",Dracula Untold
61,Terryfan,Let the games begin,8,2 June 2015,"From the moment I saw the trailer for Dracula Untold I knew this movie would be worth my time.For one it was my first Vampire movie I saw in theaters in eight years which was a long time without going to the theaters to watch a vampire film.Now this one is not the Dracula story you would expect it centers around the story of how Prince Vlad would raise to become the man we all know as Count Dracula. Prince Vlad (Luke Evans) seeks for a way to protect his family, His Wife, Mirena (Sarah Gadon), Their son Ingeras (Art Parkinson) and his kingdom and those who live in his kingdom from the armies of Mehmed (Dominic Cooper). This leads him to seek help and where he makes a deal with Master Vampire (Charles Dance) to become a vampire to do so Having the plot where Prince Vlad made a deal with the devil in the master vampire to protect his family made the plot really good and original to the story of Dracula.The acting of the film is very crafted with Luke, Sarah and Charles performances being the strongest of the cast. Luke as Dracula was one of the best performances I have seen in a long time, Sarah was a beauty for the role of Mirena and she brought the character to life also Charles Dance made for a creepy Master Vampire but he brought real credit to the roleThe music matches every scene in the film and just brings emotion to the score that's why the film is worth watching as the score matches the whole plot of the film.Lighting effects for this film was dark and it was a clever way to build the tension for the film. It's just hard to even image what to hate about this film it just shows what a real vampire film is suppose to be and it shows that Dracula has return and in a big way to boot.While it might not be the same Dracula that is well known from the story in the film or books but still I enjoy the film a lot and being the first one I saw in theaters in 8 years It's one of the film I'm glad I saw in theaters If you're a fan of Dracula and vampire films give this one a tryI give Dracula Untold an 8 out of 10",Dracula Untold
62,Troy_Campbell,"Charmless, stupid and devoid of a heart.",3,8 October 2014,"The most recent in a long line of shiny, CGI-laden retellings of classic movie properties, this attempted franchise-starter is charmless, narratively stupid and devoid of a beating heart much like the eponymous vamp. Swapping the Gothic noir of the 1932 Universal original, the genuine horror of Hammer's 1958 redux and even the stylish chills of Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 incarnation, all for a medieval-meets-supernatural romp (sound like a popular TV show much?) Dracula Untold lacks any real bite. Debutant director Gary Shore shows his inexperience with hollow set pieces, a muddled tone and editing so quick and messy during the action sequences only a crack head would be able to see what's going on. Luke Evans admirably gives his all to inject life into his Dracula, now a tormented anti-hero, and Charles Dance is joyfully menacing as an ancient bloodsucker, yet the acting plaudits end here. The usually reliable Dominic Cooper completes an embarrassing 2014 (after the woeful Need for Speed flopped at the box office and Reasonable Doubt went straight to DVD) with his cringe-worthy turn as the antagonist, whilst Sarah Gadon is vapidly conventional as Dracula's nubile young wife. If things weren't bad enough, there's a slapdash epilogue that reeks of studio pressure to leave it open for a sequel. A stake in the heart would be preferable.",Dracula Untold
63,IonicBreezeMachine,"Universal reintroduces its classic vampire monster....in what feels like a mixture of Highlander, Lord of the Rings, and a superhero origin.",5,8 May 2021,"Set in the 15th-century, Vlad Draculea (Luke Evans) is the Prince of Wallachia and Transylvania. When the Ottoman Turks lead by Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) demand in addition to their annual tribute 1,000 boys for their army, including Vlad's son, out of desperation Vlad seeks out the creature of Broken Tooth Mountain, the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) who gives him the powers of the vampire that will fade in 3 days' time, but should he feed on an innocent and give in to his new found bloodthirst he will remain a monster.Released in 2014 but beginning development in 2007, Dracula Untold marks Universal's second attempt post Brendan Fraser's Mummy franchise to restart the Universal Monster franchise following the troubled production of The Wolfman. Originally under development with Alex Proyas of Dark City and I, Robot, the film languished in development hell until first time feature director Gary Shore became attached. The movie with the final script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless has some stylish visual elements and good performances from Luke Evans and Charles Dance, but the movie misses the mark in terms of the core appeal of Dracula as a character, and feels like it's pulling its punches to the ""monster"" of this Universal Monster instead turning him into a mixture of a tragic hero and a superhero origin story.The movie does everything in it's power to make a man known as ""Vlad the Impaler"" a likable character with him being a loving husband and father and caring deeply for his kingdom ""only wanting peace""(because loving peace fits like a glove with Vlad the Impaler). The movie is epic in scope and performances, but thanks to a screenplay that's afraid of letting Dracula be a monster and a PG-13 rating that doesn't allow for ""too much blood"" the movie often feels like it's shying away from its own point of the birth of a monster because it doesn't want him to be ""too evil"" to route for in his war against the Ottomans. There's nothing wrong with showing the human side of a monster, anti-hero, or villain but aside from maybe one or two moments we never seen Luke Evans become a true monster and it plays like, to pardon the pun, the movie had its teeth filed down. Dracula Untold isn't a bad movie on its own, it's perfectly serviceable as a time killing fantasy action-adventure with slight gothic elements, but as a Dracula movie it bends and twists the character and lore to keep him ""likable"".The direction by Gary Shore is at least well done with some nicely staged shots where colors pop such as a scene with Vlad climbing Broken Tooth Mountain with his red cloak nicely staged, or some creative scenes involving negative space or a final battle between Vlad and Mehmed that is set in a room full of silver coins that is visually interesting. The performances by Luke Evans and Dominic Cooper are as expected by these two proven actors very strong and commanding, even if the material is rather beneath them in terms of characterization. The Best part of the movie for me was hands down Charles Dance as the Master Vampire, Dance is absolutely wonderful playing an ancient vampire who gives Vlad his vampiric abilities more out of boredom than for any nefarious plan and his make-up that looks inspired by Max Schrek's Nosferatu and a performance that's theatrical and nicely sinister make him the one element in Dracula Untold that I thought fit well and wanted to see more of.Dracula Untold is serviceable as a standard fantasy action film, but as an origin story for one of the most iconic movie monsters it's disappointing. With a script that's more interested in creating sympathy than fear for our title character to a tone that's designed for epic action sequences it's clear this movie didn't understand the character and appeal of Dracula and simply wanted something with mass market blockbuster appeal. The movie has some good elements in it, but they come together to create a rather toothless movie.",Dracula Untold
64,brchthethird,"A rather vanilla Gothic origin story, but still entertaining enough",6,2 March 2015,"Dracula as a character has had many incarnations over the years, from Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee, to Frank Langella and Gary Oldman. All of these brought essentially the same story, but what distinguishes Dracula UNTOLD is that it tells the heretofore ""untold"" origin story of one of literature's most enduring villains. Or is he really a villain? That's also something different that this retelling/reboot brings to the table: it recasts its titular character as a conflicted antihero, as is the fad right now. All of these elements could potentially make for a great film, but what Universal has delivered here is bland and uninspired at best. That's not to say this isn't a well-made film, but for all of the hoopla surrounding what is hoped to be the beginning of a Universal monster cinematic universe this film doesn't exactly inspire confidence in that regard.Even if you've never seen a Dracula film before, you probably already know about the character's origins as a Transylvanian prince. When the Turkish Sultan (Dominic Cooper) reinstates a tradition whereby 1000 Transylvanian boys (including Vlad's own son) are conscripted into his army, Vlad goes to a mysterious mountain in search of a way to protect his people. First, I'll get the positives out of the way. For the most part, the acting is solid. Luke Evans is decent as the titular Dracula, and he does a good job of selling him as a conflicted character. Dominic Cooper, although maybe miscast as Sultan Mahmed/Mahmoud, still acquits himself nicely by turning in a decent performance as well. I also liked some of the production design and sets. The visual effects were little more hit or miss, though. The first couple of times they show an effect of someone turning into a group of bats was pretty cool, but then they reuse that same effect over and over again. To make matters worse, using it so much obscured a lot of what was going on in and around it.This leads me to what is probably my biggest gripe: the bowdlerization of what is actually some fairly adult source material. Leaving aside the sexual metaphor of being bitten by a vampire for a little bit, Vlad in real life was an extremely violent and cruel man who intimidated invading armies by impaling people on stakes for them to see, hence his nickname. Not that the film needed to show this happening, but in general the film goes out of its way to obscure violence of any kind, be it sword fights or whatever. For a film about a bloodsucking madman, this film is curiously lacking in that department. What few battle sequences there are also take place at night, and the darkness serves as yet another way of hiding the brutal reality of medieval warfare. The film also neuters its source material by eliminating almost any sexual connotation associated with being bitten by a vampire, and worst of all never shows any penetration when someone is bitten. All of this combines to create the feeling that the PG-13 was used for profitability instead of being a purely artistic choice.Still, I wasn't ever bored while watching this. Sure, the story wasn't too original or even that well written, but despite my complaints I still think that this will satisfy the demographic its being targeted towards. The acting is decent, as is the general look of the film, despite being overly dark in some scenes. Overall, it probably won't win over any fans of previous versions of Dracula, but it is a suitably entertaining popcorn movie for the tween/teenage crowd.",Dracula Untold
65,Richie-67-485852,NOW IT CAN BE SAID...,10,4 September 2021,"Excellent origin of the age-old tale of Dracula that answers all the questions about his power, start-up and how he must live up to his bargain dare I say it forever? The pre-Dracula guy has to make one hell (pun) of a decision that begs us to ask ""what would you have done""? This is found in the finer movies of interest i.e. To wonder about decisions, outcomes and consequences from choices. Nice special believable effects and the actors committed to their roles. I would have liked this to have been a 2.5 hour movie and wonder why they didn't launch a trio of movies based on this entry afterwards? Also on display with realism is Dracula's weaknesses which make sense and again answer all our questions for this subject. In fact, this movie poses new questions. Its hard to figure out Hollywood sometimes especially when they get their way. Take Star Wars for example. In Lucas's hands, its a hit must see wow experience and one can see why and how Disney paid four billion for the rights. In Disney's hands, it faltered, paused, lost luster, intimacy and expectation for what comes next. They used the Jedi mind-trick on us methinks! I am reminded of Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings and how when left alone he spit-out three prime must-see movies that brought in billions and live forever. He insisted on NO studio interference. If only the people involved here were given their chance to continue? I usually recommend a snack and tasty drink when watching favorite flicks. However, in this movie some of the characters snack and drink on their preference if you get my meaning which may affect yours. Enjoy.",Dracula Untold
66,reddiemurf81,Underrated,7,11 August 2020,"While I wouldn't classify this as a perfect film (very few that I would) I feel it's better than a 6.3 rating. 7.5 at least,, and I wish it was more than a one and done. Actually,, I think it would've been cool if they'd made a trilogy (1st movie focusing on Vlad as a kid growing into the Impaler / 2nd movie like this one / and a 3rd with him in modern day,, perhaps something dealing with his human family (descended from his son in this movie). Just an idea,,,Seriously,,, Luke Evans and Dominic Cooper are great in this one.So go watch it!!",Dracula Untold
67,one9eighty,Leave what you know at the door and just watch the film,6,18 October 2014,"I've read a lot of reviews on this film already and most are scathing due to historical inaccuracies with the facts. While I agree with most of the reviews one thing the reviewers are forgetting is that while the events of the film don't accurately reflect Vlad's life the myth of Dracula is also fiction, fiction isn't factual. So to anyone watching this I simply advise, leave your inhibitors and expectations at the door and just try and enjoy a dark action film. Personally I think this film was okay and not terrible, I've seen a lot more awful films this year. The thing that let me down more than the dilution of any facts was the Hollywood makeover it had had. CGI was everywhere and the cast where all pretty and good looking, the men where chiseled and buff, the women were sexy and feminine, even the kids where all practically out of the Hollywood mould. It all came across too clean and organised. Despite the dark theme this was actually a family friendly film and quite tame, nothing scary enough to give nightmares. If you accept this as just an action film loosely based on fact but with sprinklings of fiction you'll be okay. If you go expecting facts about Vlad the impaler or a mythical vampire called Dracula then you'll be disappointed.",Dracula Untold
68,Vivekmaru45,"Lacks The Charm Of The Bram Stoker Novel, Which Made Dracula A Household Name Throughout The World.",7,30 December 2014,"This film is NOT a horror film. It is an fantasy-action film with historical references to the Turkish or Ottoman Empire as it was known. This film is titled Dracula Untold, so we were bound to expect something we did not know about - how Dracula as he would be later known became a vampire.I don't want to go into the plot, but the film portrays a man who is given the path to choose: good or evil. The choice this man makes affects the course of the film.Luke Evans plays Vlad III Țepeș Prince Of Transylvania, Dominic Cooper as Mehmed II Commander in chief of the Sultan's army, Sarah Gadon as Mirena wife of Vlad and Charles Dance as Master Vampire, the one who turns Vlad into a vampire. The special effects in the film though innovative at some points in the film, are outrageous in many instances. The image we have of Count Dracula sleeping in his coffin during the day and emerging to feed at night-time is not accurately portrayed in the film. Dracula moves about during the day-time although he is in the shade, protected from the sun. And during the end of the film we see him walking in broad day-light(like the vampire Blade). These are inconsistencies in the film. The only bright spot in the film is Charles Dance. He resembles the Vampire played by Max Schreck in F. W. Murnau's masterpiece Nosferatu. Fans of Charles Dance will not be disappointed even with the meager time that he is on screen. It is curious to note that actor Charlie Cox was originally cast in the role but was replaced by Charles Dance and as a result his scenes as Master Vampire were reshot. But the director made the right choice in the end by choosing Charles Dance.Other Dracula Films: Noferatu, Nosfertu The Vampire, Bram Stoker's Dracula 1992, Count Dracula 1977, Hammer Series: Dracula (1958), The Brides of Dracula (1960), Dracula: Prince of Darkness (1966), Dracula Has Risen from the Grave (1968), Taste the Blood of Dracula (1970), Scars of Dracula (1970), Dracula A.D. 1972 (1972), The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973), The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires (1974).",Dracula Untold
69,petarmatic,Very pleasantly surprised!,8,17 October 2014,"I went to see this film without much of a expectation, but I was very pleasantly surprised.First of all, for a horror film, it has a very original and interesting plot, with some (we do not know are they true or not) historical elements which connect to story of Vlad Tepes. I really enjoyed how they developed the story, and it kept my attention. It was a difficult time in the history of Europe, when the Ottomans invaded Europe and tried to conquer it all, and story of Vlad*s resistance was changed, either by people*s superstition or some other reasons into his vampire nature. Legend! For a good horror movie! Acting was excellent, I was pleasantly surprised.All in all two thumbs up, I strongly recommend this film, especially if you are into historical horrors, connected to Dracula.I also have to mention, that I would of enjoyed this film even more if there were no annoying people in the audience who loudly talked, ate their popcorn like the pigs and played with their smart phones. Can I ask those people, this way, that they should stay out of the movie theaters if they are going to do this.",Dracula Untold

He's a prince with no army to protect his people, right. Alot of situations in this film are transparently contrived.

71,billygoat1071,Substituting with Cool,4,16 October 2014,"Dracula Untold tells the origin story of the iconic monster, Count Dracula. By its aesthetics, it seems that it is more aimed to be an action film than horror, which is a strange approach. There might be a grand beginning to this legend, but the film took a serious mistake to the material, and it already starts with its PG-13 rating, bogging down the violence and the monster of the vampire. Instead of love for the camp or terror of the original story, the film rather gives cool special effects and stylish action scenes which seems to belong to a different film. We all know that vampires are awesome, but there is more interesting appeal to their capability than what it is portrayed in this film. There is some intrigue in its storyline, but Dracula Untold ends up following the cheaper type of suspense.The film starts out promising, there might be some complexity beneath the arc of Prince Vlad: a desperate prince sacrifices himself to be a monster in order to defeat his stronger enemy. But for some reason, the story rarely questions his decision. Whenever the supernatural being slays an army, it just leaves the audience being fine by what he did. It hardly explores any moral ambiguity to his vampiric turn, probably because the movie is too conscious of being cool. It robs much of the ugliness, even the horror of the tale, never giving a hint of villainy in his actions. Though he does struggle with a conflict of controlling himself from his thirst for blood, but then there's no challenge in this situation, because we already how it will turn out, even more underwhelming is what causes this fate to happen. It never gives the Impaler any personal darkness, he's basically a good guy with a misunderstood reputation, according to how the movie looks at him. This case resulting the experience as another dumb action blockbuster that takes the potential deeper parts for granted.The real baffle in this movie is its lacking sense of horror. Well, it exists in some parts, but most of the time, it seems to rather avoid the most lurid element of the violence and instead replace them with less ugly and much clean special effects to bring a different kind of tension to the action. Otherwise, this style makes it visually stale, unable to release the beast and just picture the classic vampire with typical swagger. Luke Evans looks pretty committed to the role and there is a charm for that, but the script's shallow definition for the character kept him from doing something impressive, other than the cool moves he make in those overly CGI-ed action scenes. The only actor who brings a real flavor to the film is Charles Dance, who perfectly delivers the classic vampire camp to its dreary looking world.Dracula Untold may as well be similar to another film that came out this year, Maleficent: a villain origin story that turns its character into a misjudged hero. This is a lame idea that Hollywood has come up to with these prequels, much strange is why are these movies being directed by visual obsessed filmmakers than the ones who can handle dark themes? It just fails living up to what makes these characters appealing, and even if these characters aren't that bad, these movies still fail to give them a complex character study. Vlad here is generally a cold blooded monster, but the film glosses the negative view of it with cool action scenes that makes him look more like a hero. It becomes confusing, it might work for a dumber material, but we're talking about a well familiar legendary figure here, and this is certainly a big deal.",Dracula Untold
72,RevRonster,Kinda silly...,4,13 February 2015,"I can't say my expectations were high for ""Dracula Untold"" because I've seen way too many takes on Dracula's story and vampires in general. However, when I heard that Universal wanted this film to be a jumping point for rebooting their monsters shared universe, I would be lying if I didn't think that sounded like a cool idea.For the most part, the story in ""Dracula Untold"" is functional. There's nothing ground-breaking or genre redefining with it. It's your basic ""The Villain Was Just Misunderstood"" tale but it falters thanks to some poor development—mostly with the antagonist of Mehmed (Dominic Cooper). I felt no threat level from this character and a wooden performance from Cooper wasn't helping things. Additionally, the film has a lot of bland and flavorless action that takes place in very dark surroundings and it created for a murky mess of incomprehensible nonsense. Then there's also the whole element of making Dracula ridiculously, almost to the point of laughter, over-powered. It was hard to see anything to sympathize with when your lead anti-hero seems to be limitless with his potential and abilities. It made it impossible to believe that anything bad had the potential to even happen to him.Despite this, Luke Evans is great as Vlad and the visuals are incredible. The film doesn't live up to being a decent starting point to the monsters' shared universe but there was still some potential there—mostly in the form of Luke Evans.",Dracula Untold
73,davidgee,"Camp it up a bit, Luke!",6,17 October 2014,"Dracula UNTOLD expands the five-minute prologue from Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 BRAM STOKER'S Dracula into a 90-minute 'Origins' story without adding anything much to the mythology. A lot of sword-fighting; a few spooky scenes in the bat-cave where an ancient and barely recognisable Charles Dance shreds his victims or, in Vlad's case, offers transmogrification. Plus some scenes which show Vlad Tepes as a charming happy family man in his palace (obviously not when he's impaling hundreds of his enemies!). Luke Evans is a more beefcake Vlad than Gary Oldman in the Coppola version, but he's mostly meat and not much substance, like Gerard Butler in Dracula 2001. Charles Dance seems not to mind slumming in a schlock movie but Dominic Cooper looks very uncomfortable as the evil Turkish Sultan, as well he might. This addition to the Dracula spin-offs is no worse than the 2012 ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER but not as much fun as Stephen Sommers' 2004 VAN HELSING. Luke Evans is cute but he hasn't got Hugh Jackman's charisma. Oddly, since Evans outed himself as a bi- guy on TV not long ago, there's a key ingredient that he doesn't bring to the movie which the best Draculas have had, from Bela Lugosi through to Christopher Lee and Gary Oldman: Dracula has to be played with a touch of camp!",Dracula Untold
74,bbickley13-921-58664,Universal monster becomes Universal hero,7,24 October 2014,"I herd that Universal wants to do for it's classic monsters what Marvel did with its heroes with the release of The Avengers. If that is true than this movie acts like Iron Man, but not nearly as good. Luke Evans who was the villain in Fast 6, stars as Vlad the Impaler, who makes the ultimate sacrifice of his soul to save his family by becoming the Universal classic monster, Dracula in a story line that screams Vlad the antihero. The movie spins a superhero like tale calming that the story of Dracula we know was misleading. The movie treats Dracula as if he was Captain America or Spider-Man, bitten by Nosferatu and given super hearing and sight, strength, and speed, and the ability to fly by turning into bats (Seriously, an entire scene in the movie describes his powers just like that), and of course what good superhero does not have a Kryptonite, right? bet you can't guess what's Dracula's?For what it was, the movie was not half bad, but I can't see it being the next superhero movie craze.

75,MattBrady099,The empty bucket of movie ideas.,5,9 October 2014,"Another vampire movie that tries to be the true originals of Dracula. Well they got whatever was left from the empty bucket of movie ideas. The story: The movie is about the true-life ruler that Dracula is based on - and here his bloody history is brought to life. When I first heard this movie was coming out the first thought I got was ""Really, another Dracula movie"". But when I heard Luke Evans was going to be in it, I was a bit interesting; then the people who worked on the film said the film is the true original story of the blood sucking demon. So I was interested in the film, and after seeing it... I was a bit let down to be honest. The Characters in the movie are just as lifeless as Dracula. The movie wants you to care about them but you just don't and that to me is the biggest thing that the movie fails to deliver. And the movie took it self way too seriously, with no fun to have with the movie. But Luke Evans did a fine job playing Dracula and the sets in the movie was pretty spot on, the fights scenes where pretty fun to watch and it was well shot. But the movie itself is so forgettable, so dull and so recycled right now, I'm getting pretty sick of the Dracula story.",Dracula Untold
76,Al_The_Strange,Dracula Untold Review,7,21 October 2014,"Dracula's story has been told and re-told so many times in so many different ways that the mere thought of having a ""untold"" Dracula tale comes off as ironic. But there is potential, especially in the historic roots of the character (as inspired by Vlad III ""The Impaler,"" or ""The Son of the Dragon,"" considered a hero of Wallachia, but also an infamous butcher everywhere else). Regardless, very few films have explored exactly how Dracula became such a cruel bloodsucking vampire.The film kicks off with a prologue sequence that spells out who Vlad is and what the Turks are doing to his kingdom, in a style that feels like a moving graphic novel. From then on, the film wastes little time in pitting the titular prince against the Turkish army. Naturally, the prince resorts to fighting evil with evil, consorting with a vampire to gain supernatural powers. From then on, Vlad goes on to crush waves of Turks almost single-handedly. Most of the time, he's either transforming into a swarm of bats that rushes through his enemies, or he's slicing necks with expert swordplay. Scenes in between the action rarely drag; there is a fair amount of drama involved between the prince, his wife, his son, his followers - adding vampirism to these relationships offers a few intriguing twists and implications worth exploring.However, the story is pretty standard fare; it's as if they took 300, took out the Spartans, replaced Leonidas with Dracula, and used Castlevania as a backdrop. As cool as it is to see a medieval Transylvania in action, the story is very simple and straightforward, and can be quite predictable. Most of it feels like it could have used more refinement; plot holes can undoubtedly be found, and more character development would be quite welcome. The whole film breezes by in a formulaic fashion, entwining bits of history with bits of vampire legend, but it amounts to very little that feels fresh, new, or invoking.The film generally looks okay, with mostly-good photography and editing. Some of the action scenes have horrid camera work. Acting is okay: I enjoyed watching Luke Evans as the main character, and other actors can be a hit or a miss. Writing is quite simple and unrefined. This production uses pretty fine-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects offer some good-looking views of fantastic places, and are good with some of the creature effects, but are rougher in the action scenes. Music sounds like more of the same.Dracula Untold is certainly action-packed and takes advantage of some of the original lore of the character, but it also feels like just another typical swords and sorcery flick. Fans of the character or genre may find it worth renting.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Average)",Dracula Untold
77,ArchonCinemaReviews,Stylish but does not add substance to ancestry already in films,5,14 October 2014,"Dracula Untold tells of untold origin story of Dracula, reimagined by Hollywood for the big screen.Vlad Tepes is the prince of a kingdom under siege during the middle ages, willing to do anything to protect and preserve it in Dracula Untold.Dracula Untold tells of Vlad's creation into the being that is known as Dracula. He is a ruler and his most important duty is to his people. Diplomacy with ancient Turkey is increasingly more improbable and more extreme measures are to be taken. He strikes a deal with a dark force Caligula in the hopes to save his people while trying to salvage his humanity and save himself from being overtaken by the supernatural forces consuming his mind and body.As with most Hollywood tales trying to tear their content from the history books – the story portrayed in Dracula Untold is not an accurate record of accounts. Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless did an adequate job of using the legend of Vlad the Impaler as inspiration for the narrative. Definitely amped for the big screen, I appreciate the avoidance to embellish and glorify the action sequences for easy shock and awe. I also appreciate the desire to make the story of Vlad more complex rather than take the obvious route.Dracula Untold is a dark Gothic tale with solid action sequences but it never crosses the line to greatness. Besides Vlad, all characters are underdeveloped and this hinders the plot from feeling fully formed. Its beautifully produced and the landscapes are gorgeous but Dracula Untold does not add much substance to the already insurmountable catalog of Dracula ancestry.For more reviews in FULL check out our website!",Dracula Untold

It's 90% CGI so for the actors there's not a lot to do and when there is they're very dull. I want to like the lead actor, Luke Eveans but's hes as emotive as a fatigued clam. And not sexy.

Luke Evans portrays the title character, and Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper, Art Parkinson, and Charles Dance appear in supporting roles.In 15th-century Transylvania, Vlad III (Luke Evans), prince of Wallachia, is known as a just ruler. With his beloved wife, Mirena (Sarah Gadon), Vlad has brokered a prolonged period of peace and ensured that his people are protected, especially from the Ottoman Empire. However, when Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) demands 1,000 of the country's boys, including Vlad's son, for his army, Vlad makes a deal with a monster that will enable him to defeat the Turks -- but cost him his humanity.",Dracula Untold
80,p-jonsson,Regardless of what some people say this is not a bad movie.,8,13 February 2015,"That the so called ""critics"" at Rotten Tomatoes screws this movie over is not really a surprise. Said ""critics"" are usually out of sync with both my opinions and the opinions of most of the viewers which can be seen again from the fact that these people give this movie a 23% rating whereas the actual viewers give it a 60% rating. At lot of ""purists"" also seem to take a disliking to this movie. Well, the movie is named Dracula Untold so it should be no surprise that the story would be a new one.Personally I found this movie quite enjoyable. Yes it is not the original Dracula story but it is not straying too far from the basic origins and it is really a quite decent story unlike some of the disastrous Hollywood rewrites. The original story claims that Dracula became a vampire during his battles with the Turks and this movie picks up on that and tells the story of how that happened. Unlike most (all?) Dracula movies, Dracula is not really the bad guy but rather the inverse and the movie tells a story about sacrifices and Dracula's quest to keep some of his humanity, moral and sanity.It would not be a Dracula movie without some blood flowing and this movie delivers without overdoing it. Actually the actual bloodsucking stuff is quite played down until the end of the movie. There are a fair amount of fights against the Turks (who are the real bad guys in this movie) though and blood as well as various body parts no longer attached to their proper places does float around quite a bit. The special effects are not forgotten and I quite liked the bat swarms that Dracula commanded during the final fights against the Turks.I found Luke Evans performance as the prince and unwilling Dracula to be quite good. The rest of the characters were also well played. I am sure that none of them will be nominated for Oscars due to their part in this movie but I have nothing negative to say about their performance.On the whole I found this movie quite enjoyable and I definitely disagree with all the people blasting it. I did also quite like the last couple of scenes in modern time at the end which teased of a follow up movie. I would definitely like to see that happen.",Dracula Untold

82,scottshak_111,Forget everything you know about Drac and you may like it,7,18 October 2014,"Told by a beautiful dark direction of the newbie ‎Gary Shore‬, Stoker's tale has found a perfect variant.‎Luke‬ is ravishing in the drac shoes and the tale is brilliantly scripted. There are subtle glimpses that Shore uses like depicting rad scenes of war through the dead eyes of a Turk that makes things different. Although the action bit isn't that great and put out quickly, the story still keeps you rooted. Some clichéd pieces pop up here and there, but its our own favourite fictional protag Drac, what do you expect? The score is apt. It makes you feel the vampire wrath. Screenplay is good.When we contain the awesomeness of Luke's gripping facial gravity, make it dark, combine it with some twists and turns of the legendary Bram Stoker's tale, add some ‪Cooper‬ to it, throw in some ‪Charles Dance‬ grim screenplay voice then lo! we get a good decent movie that has the potential to run a fine franchise on its own.Can't wait for the sequel now!",Dracula Untold

The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good. The cinematography is incredible. The costumes and sets fit the time period to a t which is a breath of fresh air due to this being a horror type period piece. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.,Dracula Untold
85,reb-warrior,I thought it was entertaining,8,21 October 2015,"I mean I'm not a Vlad/Dracula buff or anything so maybe this gives my viewing experience more leeway. I guess a lot of criticism about this movie is that it ignores history. Yep. But I still found it entertaining. It was a great action flick with pretty good cgi effects and an engaging story. I never left once for a snack break, because I was glued to the screen. That says a lot for me.The story is a different take, yet the many elements are the same such as Vlad's conflict with the Turks, and his great love for his wife. He's Dracula, but he's not portrayed as evil. He's complex and written as sympathetic, tragic, and romantic. I didn't find it scary. There are horror elements. I think I may have a high scare factor threshold as I don't scare easily. From movies, that is. Luke Evans is very good in the role, as is Charles Dance. I found all the other actors slightly weak in their roles.I don't recommend this movie for history buff sticklers. It will probably frustrate you. Anybody else, I think you'll be fine with it.",Dracula Untold

Overall a real good quality bubblegum piece well worth a watch...though it should be watched on the big screen( as with ALL movies).Very violent but never bloody and agonises over the old adage that "" A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do""!Would love to see a follow as to how he evolves into the character we all know and love but I can't see that happening.",Dracula Untold

This is the tale of How Vlad the Impaler, son of the Dragon becomes Dracula, son of the Devil. Classed as a horror film, this version was way more than that. This was an epic re telling of perhaps one of the most famous tales of all time, but it was a love story, a story of a man living peaceably with his family while ruling his kingdom, and then ultimately an account of what he is prepared to do to protect all that he holds dear. Luke Evans (Dracula) is very easy on the eye even when we see his dark side. His wife, played by Sarah Gadon, is pretty and sweet and everything that Vlad is not. The bad guy, Mehmed, is played by Dominic Cooper and he glowers at life from behind heavily kohled eyes. Some brilliant effects, destroying a vampire has come a long way from the days when Buffy was turning the bad guys to dust. Some epic scenery and as usual from the land of celluloid there were some beautiful beautiful horses. This was a great film, definitely one for the DVD collection.",Dracula Untold
88,troyputland,Dracula's been told too many times...,5,23 April 2015,"It's hard to keep track of how many times the story of Dracula's been told. This is the 'apparent' untold story but it's more like a new(ish) story's been slapped on a renown vampire so the film studio can rake in some money. It doesn't work. Try as he might, Luke Evans cannot live up to the legend. A shoddy script gets in his way, as does a plot riddled with holes. Plenty of moments arrive where you'll think to yourself, 'why didn't they do that?'. Possibilities are ignored to fill the running time. Dominic Cooper yet again feels like the wrong person for his role. Just like his villain in Need for Speed, he lacks the intimidation, power, and ultimately, the look. Vlad (Evans) goes to extreme measures to save his son and his people from Turkish invasion. Some cool 'one man army' battles take place but it's not enough to keep us completely entertained.Check out my other film reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",Dracula Untold
89,rehmankhilji,Let the Games Begin,6,8 November 2014,"A simply treat to watch over the weekend. Luke Evans and Dominic Cooper playing their role too good. Especial effects are worth watching. Dracula is one concept upon which hundreds of the movie are made. This movie keeps the originality of the concept and made a beautiful presentation. Let the Games Begin was my favorite line of the movie and the movie ends on the same as well. As for the turks having such a huge army, well that was not something digestible for me. Nevertheless there has to be a bad guy in the movie and let it be Turk Muslims. Charles Dance added beauty to his role and presented the master vampire very good. The conversation and all to vampire was beautifully shown. Thank God the cheap stuff like Vampire glow if in sun like the stupid Twilight series presented which completely makes you puke. Nevertheless a good movie and worth watching.",Dracula Untold
90,ultramatt2000-1,I can't believe what I saw....,4,1 December 2014,"You heard me, I can't believe what I saw. This is a monster that is not like the previous Dracula pictures. This is a Frankenstein's Monster made up of other movies such as ""300"" (read my review), ""The Hobbit"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""Twilight"", Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy and ""Man of Steel"". In other words, it is to much on the action, drama, fantasy and adventure, but less on the horror (the only scary scene there is the tarantula in the cave). It plays out like a prequel to the Dracula stories, but there are scenes that predate later characters. For instance, the man who called Dracula master, might be Reinfeld's ancestor. Dracula in ""Dracula Untold"" has turned into an epic hero and Frankenstein has turned into a gritty, butt-kicking detective in ""I Frankenstein."" Godzilla in the film under the same name is left alone (thank goodness). I think Universal is trying to reboot their classic monsters to make a cinematic universe much in the same way as those Marvel Superhero movies. Luke Evans is great and the same goes to the special effects. As the old saying goes, there is nothing new under the sun, which is why Hollywood keeps spewing out remakes, sequels, prequels, spin-offs and reboots. Not to mention adapting TV shows, cartoons, comics and books (specifically the ones for young adults, but there are other books out there that deserve to be movies). It is not as awful as, let's say, ""The Room"", ""Battlefield Earth"" or classics like ""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie"". Bottom line: This movie is good for anyone who enjoys action movies. Oh well, nobody is perfect. Rated PG-13 for violence, brief nudity, gore and your usual run-of-the-mill scary scenes.",Dracula Untold
91,carlos37andre,It was a good concept,4,25 May 2020,"It has a good idea on paper. But man, the characters are so poorly written (not even written it seems like). I like the first big action scene, I like some of the shoots, alongside with the cinematography, but man, at some point the movie just turns into a big hot mess.You start to get tired so quickly, of the fight scenes when you can't never tell what exactly is going on, is either that the camera is moving so much you can't even focus, or that everything is way too dark for you to see a thing.And, of course, they have the balls to set up a sequel, or whatever that was. I mean, damnit, Universal, how are you able to screw this universe up twice before it even starts? (this and Tom Cruise's Mummy, of course). It's insane, this finally is horrible, it makes no sense, you don't feel a thing for the guy, you don't care the chick looks like his wife (what's the point? It's not her).Well, there isn't much more to say, at the end, the movie is just forgettable, it goes for the easy rout every single time, it doesn't surprise you at all, and it focus more on building up sequels, than truly telling a good story. And that's how you kill a franchise, before it even begins.",Dracula Untold
92,trokanmariel-17760,"The legacy of maturity, protected by Luke Evans",9,9 December 2020,"The unfortunate situation. Already, the prelude to American destiny paradigm has taken its elegant structure, and yet, one feels it necessary to partake in the survival of the fittest dimension.In the caves of the master vampire (Charles Dance), Vlad (Luke Evans) and his discussion about survival of the fittest is indeed, the story of Americanism's call to heroism of the other, however, such is the library-misdemeanour of Dracula Untold: its fitting tribute to the intellectualism of heroism is anointed its annoyance, by also being a situation of glamour's (leadership's) typical undoing by the antithesis.And alas. The SOTF paradigm extends to the last info. In general, what I'm speaking of is that DU is an excellent portrait of people, but it is ironically a duality system of boredom imitating the excellence.A warrior man, who needs to protect his kingdom. His saving grace is the unknown. Already, one has the duality system in place, with its reaches knowing where to start and where to end. To an adult man, the unknown can be a stupid predicament, and thus, is the point: difference is DU's UD.Truth be told: I was loosely following myself, around most of the previous paragraph, only becoming proper at the very end.In Dracula Untold, the man is the window into the substance. Perhaps that's somewhat how DU becomes UD; it shows substance. From the very beginning, the 'Behind to Wait' posture of Vlad, while in the forest with his unit, to Sarah Gadon's pleas to protect her son from joining the army, to the outrage illustrated by Vlad, when he proclaims ""...because of what I did to save you!"", and then finally, to the end, in which Vlad's army of vampires are the shown substance - the silver horse, DU has its boredom as its property (but then, such was my own ironic luck, of reaching to this juncture in the commentary, despite being an adult man).Laughing at people is substance; what's greater substance, is adult men and women in DU doing their part to uphold the stuff of nightmares",Dracula Untold

The movie opens with Vlads son narrating about his father at a young age when the turks took him away from his father to prepare him for battle. He became known as Vlad the impeller who with his fierce skill scared his enemy's back to their land. The film revolves around Vlad who wants to live in his kingdom in peace. But peace comes at a price when the turk leader comes at his door and demand one thousand boys for their army like they did when Vlad was a child. He refuses this offer and chooses to gain power to destroy his enemies and protect his family,. He has only three days to defeat his enemies, resist the thirst for blood and save his kingdom. The atmosphere is right, it feels like a dark medieval tale and a war film. The first appearance of the vampires is short but cool and the best part is that creepy is when Vlad meets the master vampire on the top of the cave to gain the power of a vampire. The performances are all out for this film with the actors having fun in their roles. Earlier this year their was another film based on a classic Universal monster called I. Frankenstein and it had terrible cgi and was very boring. The story here in Dracula Untold though is effective to it's points that sometimes to do good we must do bad and unleash the monster within us. Dracula Untold is a fun effective film with better cg and a story with a good origin in the legend of darkness and blood known as Dracula. I give Dracula Untold a 10 out of 10",Dracula Untold
94,foxtografo,Bad cliché collection,3,16 April 2015,"From the beginning, I wasn't impressed by the trailer, I thought it looked less than average, but finally found a moment when I felt like watching some action and special effects to have fun. This movie was a pain to watch. And I'm not saying that it's historically inaccurate, it's a sequence of bad clichés that build up around amazingly weak characters and a really bad story. I won't enumerate the ridiculous and ""eye rolling"" scenes not to bore everyone, but it was probably more than half of the movie. The characters are unattractive, bland, and shallow with no exceptions. The action scenes didn't impressed me at all and were boring and unimaginative. The special effects were average and repetitive. Luckily it wasn't a long movie, but even an hour and half were too much. I don't dislike Luke Evans as an actor, but this character wasn't for him and it was really badly written. I didn't expected a documentary, like the people that liked the movie is arguing about bad reviews. It's a really bad fantasy movie on it's own and it doesn't stand up in any aspect that I can think of.",Dracula Untold
95,helmutty,Too short to fully suck my attention,6,6 October 2014,"It is one of the Universal Monsters reboots. And I am not impressed yet. The re-imagining of Dracula of turning him into a sort of anti-hero sounds promising but the movie is too short to suck the audience's attention. With the short runtime of 1 hour 32 minutes (plus credits), there is little things to do. Everything seems rushed to meet the time. The development of Dracula is rushed. What you will be watching is a generic medieval war movie that just happens to have vampires and bats.The story: It is a seriously straight-forward plot given the short runtime. Vlad (played by Luke Evans) faces troubles and dilemma of protecting his family and people and turns into the titular monster. Surprisingly the movie starts out slow, there are no big battles. The first twenty minutes puts Vlad in a realistic problem of saving his family and people. When they are threatened, he turns to an mysterious sorcerer for a way out. As he becomes a superhuman, he has to fight the urge of human blood. It leads to what we all know, Dracula. The story is like any other war movies but with a dash of vampires. There are only a few action scenes. Though they are decently choreographed, the disappointing thing is that Vlad's real strength is not properly realised in any of those action scenes. Sure, there may be some great CGI of bats swarming around but that's all. For a big budget movie, it is flat out disappointing. Acting is passable. Luke Evan is so-so. Dominic Cooper is in a wasted role who does not appear many times. Music wise is okay, sounds generic.Overall: With a big budget, I was disappointed at how the movie turns out to be. It seems that first time director Gary Shore has a visionary idea about the whole thing but it is not fully realised here. Instead it turns out to be an ordinary action flick. Vlad has a lot of potential to develop and show but it is not justified by the rushed runtime and tepid action scenes. If this becomes a franchise, I hope the future sequels will turn out better.More reviews: http://moreviewsed.blogspot.sg",Dracula Untold
96,loco_73,Dracula I'm Bored!,6,12 October 2014,"""Dracula Untold"" must be one of those movies conceived in some studio's board room by a collection of pea-size brained executives, who one morning decided to just google the name Dracula and then proceeded to say ""Uhhhh I like this...and I like that...oh and look at this...and look at that..."". Then they went ahead and just threw all those facts and figures together creating the hodge-podge non-sensical concoction that is this movie. One that more resembles an extended pilot episode from one of those really crummy series that currently air on SyFy...Honestly sometimes I think that a bunch of baboons throwing feces at one another could come up with a better movie than this!If you hoped that this movie will bring about some fresh perspective on the myth of Prince Vlad The Impaler, aka Vlad Tepes aka Vlad Draculea..aka Dracula, you can forget that...and best be prepared for a cheesy B-movie with A-list aspirations! Luke Evans surely has charisma and talent enough to imbue the movie with at least a spark of interest, thus the 6 out of 10. There is clearly potential to be had here. But a PG-13 rating, a crummy script, shoddy direction and poor editing...pretty much render this movie spayed and neutered! The movie tries to tell a ""different"" story about Dracula, his origins and his beginnings, but it fails in its attempt, drowned in a sea of mediocrity! Add to that, the concluding scenes of this movie, which come out of the blue and really make little to no sense within the context of what you've just seen...other than clearly serve as the set-up for a sequel...Even the presence of 3 ""Game Of Thrones"" cast members cannot alter that fact, Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister), Art Parkinson (Rickon Stark) and Paul Kaye (Thoros Of Myr). Besides there is also Dominic Cooper, perhaps best known as Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father, and he cannot add much to the movie! Too bad, because Luke Evans is clearly a star waiting to step forth...perhaps the upcoming ""The Hobbit: The Battle Of Five Armies"" will be a better opportunity for him to shine!",Dracula Untold

It's not that bad. First of all, it has no real horror stuff, despite talking about Dracula's origins. It also has not much evidence/relation to the Dracula legend; it's more likely an invention around the true, existing historical character, and the stoker's Dracula (I assume, I haven't read that book) I didn't like, first of all, it's lenght and the poorness of story that we have after the end. It certainly lacks some points, could have expanded a little bit. What I DID like was the theatricality of the whole thing, the fight scenes, and all that stuff. I'm not a fan of horror-fantasy at all, but I must say that I liked it, even if just a little bit. I heard someone saying in the group I was with that there was ""poor acting"". Were?

There are scenes where the castle is being bombed and yet Vlad (Evans) and Mirena (Sarah Gadon) are standing their macking on each other and posing for glamour shots!Oh don't mind the bombs bombing your castle and your people, I'm sure they don't mind watching you try to eat each others faces off!Aside from having probably the worst version of a vampire I've seen on screen, I think Vlad accepted it too easily and seemed to know what and how to do things very quickly.It has some good special effects – there's one good thing about it.I hate to think that this is (or was) supposed to the beginning of the new cinematic universe for the Universal Monsters.CHAPPY THINKS this story should have stayed untold!",Dracula Untold

100,Spartan_1_1_7,Dracula done right.,8,12 November 2014,"""There is always a price for power.""Dracula Untold is like Batman Begins for Dracula. It is an origin story for how Dracula came into being. And it pretty much succeeds in delivering that.This movie nails it where it counted the most .i.e. depicting Dracula. Luke Evans was awesome as Dracula. He just fitted perfectly in the role. This is Dracula like never seen before, we get to see the Human side of him, his downward spiral into the monster he becomes from a good prince 'Vlad'. When Vlad goes all Dracula mode, he was VERY BADASS. They truly made him into a powerful monster and seeing that was oh so satisfying. Many epic moments in the movie related to it. My favourite moment was:His wife, Mirena, played by Sarah Gadon was pretty good too. She looked beautiful and their relationship didn't bog down the movie that much like many other romances usually do, still annoying sometimes.CGI effects were pretty decent. But you could spot inconsistencies here and there. Soundtrack was good.Now, the movie was really short and felt rushed. Many scenes would have been better if they received some room to breath. Would have been better if it was like an hour and a half longer. They could have added more scenes of his fight against the thirst. They could have also added one or two good secondary characters and developed them nicely. The villain was also mostly meh.All in all, even with its flaws, the movie was really entertaining and did Dracula right.

And in that sense, got a lot right.-Dracula Untold was actually really good. The trailers looked good, and I was hoping it would be good, but it was a lot better than I thought! -The story was very good. I am glad they took time to talk about Vlad the Impaler and Ottoman Turks and stuff! -The acting was good. Luke Evans as Dracula was great actually. Just like Angeline Jolie in Maleficent, I can't think of anyone better for the role. So yes, Luke Evans is my new favorite Dracula. Sorry Gary Oldman.-The pace was great. It was not too long of a movie and it got straight to business. The tone was dark, but in a prequel about Dracula you don't really expect the happiest things to happen.-The effects were impressive. The music was great! I want that soundtrack. Actually I think Ramin Djawadi is working at becoming my new favorite composer.-The film is PG-13 and it's really only for violence and scary images. There was little language, a shirtless guy, and that's about it. It was violent. Lots of impaling going on there. It was not too scary either, which I liked. It had creepy stuff, but only two jumpscares, which were not all that scary.-Did not like the ending that much. Still better ending than The Maze Runner.-So overall Dracula Untold was impressively, well, impressive. It told a great story through action, good effects and acting, and impaling. Lots of PG-13 impaling. I would easily say that if you like Dracula the character or films of the sort (Van Helsing, The Wolfman, etc.) than Dracula Untold is totally worth seeing in theaters!! I would, no joke, give Dracula Untold an 8/10! I was going to give it a 7.5, but I enjoyed it more than Boyhood, so yeah.",Dracula Untold
102,hypestyle,"Dracula Saga gets Comic Book Reboot in ""Untold""",6,27 December 2014,"""Dracula Untold"" is the latest in Universal Pictures' enduring film series based on the iconic vampire. However, this story (directed by Gary Shore) bears zero resemblance to the Bela Lugosi films of old. The Victorian-informed narrative of Bram Stoker's original novel is bypassed in favor of a Crusades-era war between kingdoms.In this origin film, Luke Evans is the tragic Vlad Tepis ""The Impaler"", a brooding Transylvanian prince who finds his lands at the mercy of the avaricious Ottoman warlord Mehmet (Dominic Cooper.) Adding backstory to the backstory, Vlad apparently spent most of his childhood as a conscripted child soldier in the service of Mehmet's sultan father. Now married with a son, Vlad finds himself about to repeat history, as Mehmet demands that Vlad send 1,000 boys to serve as soldiers, or forfeit his lands-- and his life.Knowing that his own army is drastically outnumbered by the Ottoman horde, Vlad desperately turns to the shadowy creature that he just barely escaped some weeks before, and makes a dark pact to save his people. What the creature is shouldn't be a surprise to viewers: Vlad then becomes a literal bat-man, with super-strength and the ability to morph into a flock of bats at will. (One wonders: does he lose a finger or a toe if one bat gets lost? Never mind.) But Vlad's rebirth as a night stalker comes at a cost: if he imbibes human blood within three days, his vampire curse will be eternal. Cue the ticking clock.Visually, the film owes much to Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings/Hobbit"" series of films that revived the medieval-fantasy genre. Despite the CGI in abundance it appears that dozens of real-life extras in helmets and chain mail were used in the army sequences. The cinematography takes good advantage of the Northern Ireland landscapes that stand in for Eastern Europe.While the visuals are all fascinating, the story (by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless) leaves something to be desired. The abrupt pacing of the film-- around 90 minutes-- leaves little time to appreciate the doomed romance between Vlad and Mirena (Sarah Gadon) that viewers are expected to latch onto; the father-and-son subplot suffers similarly. Such concerns take a back seat to showcasing several CGI-abetted combat scenes, including a ""bat tornado"" and a ""sword's-eye-view"" sequence that are admittedly impressive. However, by film's end Vlad/Dracula's presumed status as a newly-minted anti-hero doesn't feel quite earned. As the title character, Evans (""Clash of the Titans"", ""Fast & Furious 6"") embodies the romance-novel reinterpretation of Dracula, complete with a just-right mullet and permanent five O'clock shadow.For subtext scholars, there's a nominal Christian vs. Muslim micro-story, and Dracula's initially grudging, then wholehearted embrace of literally monstrous tactics to combat an aggressive threat from a distant land has inadvertent relevance in today's political headlines. (""Men don't fear swords; (but they do) fear monsters"", Vlad sneers at one point; he later berates his countrymen as weaklings after his vampire nature is exposed.) Then again, it's doubtful that the film's producers intended on making commentary on U.S. intelligence policy.With Legendary Studios (""Godzilla"") as a co-financier, the corporate plan is to reboot Universal's horror catalog as an interconnected series of tales, like many comic book-based films of recent years. With ""Dracula Untold"" as a slightly anemic first entry, the new ""Universal Monsters"" franchise needs a transfusion of character development in order to be truly biting.",Dracula Untold
103,skoyles,Shakespearian,9,9 February 2015,"""Dracula Untold"" has a title that is catchy but is not descriptive. With the obvious goal of blending some history with Hollywood's Dracula/Nosferatu legacy, the producers came up with a fascinating new vision. Luke Evans is very good in the title role and the supporting actors are uniformly good, with a special mention of Charles Dance. The various parties with axes to grind about such fiction will never be satisfied, whatever the movie might be, and both professional historians and average folks come near to blows over the character of Vlad Tepes and of Mehmet. This motion picture has a consistent view point. Flaws? Of course. Vlad is a Prince yet there is reference to his Kingdom rather than to his Princedom or Principality. The ending may be a bit saccharine but I liked it and hope for a sequel. The title? Surely this should have been called ""The Tragedy of Vlad Tepes, Prince of Wallachia"". Shakespeare would have loved it.",Dracula Untold

105,trey-yancy-572-763547,This is the definitive Dracula movie - the very best ever made,10,3 February 2018,"Without exception this is the best Dracula movie ever. The story is great, as is the character development. The acting, direction, FX, and everything else is truly fantastic. Unlike every other vampire movie ever, this is an intelligent movie that tells a meaningful story. Its purpose is not to be a horror story, but a story of honor, self-sacrifice, and commitment. This is a Vlad Dracul that you can respect and admire. He is portrayed (albeit with some liberties) as a human being dealing with extraordinary circumstances. While the ending returns us to familiar territory, this is a guy that you can't help rooting for. If there ever were a direct sequel, I could see it completely rewriting the original. As with Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, you want the antihero to destroy that which threatens him. I bought this film, first as DVD and later as on iTunes. It is a movie that the intelligent viewer - the person interested in a genuine story and not just done-to-death garbage - should buy and watch again and again. 
Young viewers in their twenties may disagree, as they tend to favor action-packed gore-fests and as they are not as well versed in the history and events of the period, and particularly those who have ever put their lives on the line for their principles, this removes a lot of the substance. But for those who like a good story backed up by an excellent production, Dracula Untold is the absolutely definitive telling of the tale - told as it should have been from the start.",Dracula Untold
106,By-TorX-1,"Dracula, with a Dash of Thor and King Leonidas",7,30 March 2017,"Dracula untold is an enjoyable, if curious, take on the classic vampire tale, and Luke Evans gives a commanding presence as Vlad, bestowing upon him noble family and patriotic reasons for opting to transform into the titular bloodsucker. Visually, the film is a treat and in terms of theme and tone it is essentially a superhero take on Dracula, with a large portion of 300-style warrior antics thrown in for good measure (not forgetting a dash of romance, too). As such, the film is never dull and nor does the pace ever flag. However, with so many genres battling for attention, inevitably there are points that needed more detail, most significantly that of Dominic Cooper's character, the Sultan. As Dracula's antagonist, he is a little sketchy, a factor all the more evident when his convenient and unexplained knowledge of vampire 'Kryptonite' comes in to play within the climactic battle. Sadly, the final scene hints at the promise of further Dracula adventures in the modern world that have so far failed to materialize, which is a shame as the world seems ready for Super-Drac.",Dracula Untold
107,cnycitylady,'Dracula' wins the heart of the Audience.,7,28 November 2014,"'Dracula Untold' is the best Dracula movie in a very long time. It takes the origin story of the famous eternal and puts a noble and heroic spin on it that retains and perhaps enhances the romantic and esoteric tale.Here Dracula is the wise, kind and generous Prince of a small kingdom. He is in love with his beautiful wife and they have a young boy. But terror befalls them when they are obliged to give up one thousand boys to their imperialistic ruler. Refusing to do so, Dracula (N.e. Vladimir) undertakes the burden of the vampire. The story that ensues is action packed, sweet, tender, brave and sad. The heartbreak that haunts Dracula is front and center in this movie. He fights and fights his desire for blood, determined not to give into the darkness that is eating at his soul.The scenes are gritty and dark, but the script and the direction that the story takes leaves room for an inner light in even the darkest of characters. The hero is empathetic and his lady love is honestly in love with him, making him even more likable. Their love isn't cheesy or over the top. It is simple and she is worthy. The story actually gets to you emotionally as you feel for the loss that these characters face and by the end you are actually wishing for a sequel.I went into this movie with very low expectations and it tore through the ceiling and out of the boundaries of what anyone expects from a retelling of the classic Dracula. I hope they choose to continue this new and refreshing take on Dracula. 7/10",Dracula Untold
108,gerry_barnaby,The Best Told Dracula Film to date with Real History,10,4 October 2014,"First i will say is this is not a horror story as such, but there was a few moment that really do make you jump, this really impressed me by keeping true to the history of Vlad the impaler with the Turks taking young boys from family at a young age & raining them to be warriors which one such boy was vlad. The real history was that vlad after returning home the Turk started again which start a war with vlad. this is where the legend of vlad the impaler story became a vampire as people so though it was when he conquered his enemy & put their body's on pikes & drunk there blood as a right of strength, this is what put the fear in to the enemy think that vlad was some monster. What clever about this film is it show details of this history with the fantasy of the vampire, but the story is much more than just a vampire story there is a much bigger story going on behind it that is not shown in the trailers which made this film a lot better than people have made it out to be. Yes there is some sort of love story there but as this film process you can see where this is heading, i will say this is the best Dracula film I've seen in a while. The other films in the past have portrayed Dracula as just a monster, a killing machine with the thirst for blood, but with this film they portray him as a monster but also a character with love & strength to resist the darkness & corruption that come from being vampire. This darkness is brilliant portray by Luke Evans playing Vlad Tepes, his performance in this film is outstanding in ever way not only showing a father figure & a family man but also the strength & resolve to protect his people no matter the cost which lends him to this path of darkness to the first vampire played brilliantly by Charles Dance, who's presence in this film is truly frightening & chilling to say the least, the on screen presence as him playing this master vampire is truly outstanding & very believable. Sarah Gadon was absolutely brilliant playing the mother & wife of Vlad with a lot of passion in her heart for the man she loves Sarah performance really show this perfect on screen, great performance. Art Parkinson (game of thrones star) who plays the son done a brilliant job portraying the son of vlad with a great performance, Dominic Cooper done a brilliant job as the general Mehmed great final battle scene that well choreograph. Not once did this film give up the dark concept & a war torn country but also the dark concept of the vampire which makes this one of the most epic vampire film that not only gives you a true Dracula love story but also portrays Dracula better. Those that have play the game castle Castlevania will see this film also has that slight concept of the game as well .One thing this film dose have is there is a bigger story in the concept going on which if you miss the dialogue you will miss the concept of the ending that i mention is beyond the love story, the vampire story as it become a game of chest which i though was very clever in the story. The fight scene & battle scene are outstandingly choreograph with authentic battle armour from the time period & some of the best special effects with the bats is just spectacular, special with the way they had the morphing of Luke characters from human to hundreds of bats to solid form these special effect much of took ages to do, the team have really pulled this effect off brilliantly.This is a film i highly recommend watching at the cinema, epic tale of honour, love & struggle.",Dracula Untold
109,Lomedin,No originality,3,23 January 2016,"This movie can be easily defined as a potpourri of other movies put together. Every moment and line can be traced back to another movie. Furthermore, the dialogues selected to be borrowed are poor, at best, matching those ""cool"" scenes the movie is made of. ""Cool"" as understood by a 13 years old boy or a childish adult without imagination.The cast is forgettable, except for Mr. Dance, whose short appearance is wasted in a shallow and, yet again, clichéd character. And what to say of Luke Evans, who looks (and acts) in this movie like Orlando Bloom on steroids. With not such beautiful hands, by the way, as a side note.The whole religious theme in the movie is another point for me to classify it as boring, overused and even cheesy.The special effects are flawless, though.As an interesting note regarding people rating this movie with 10 stars and such, have a look at those people's accounts: like in so many other movies rated in IMDb, you'll see that they lack even the basic information, and that they only posted one single review (the high score in question), which probably means you have an agent explicitly paid to leave a positive review. A practice that, sadly, seems to be common here. Those are the disadvantages of open, free voting systems. Although, like I said, you only need a bit of common sense and a look at the user account to find the impostors and filter out these industry-paid fakes.Alas, festival of clichés and a good few completely predictable moments that surely will be the delight of immature men and underage denizens.",Dracula Untold
110,vistheindian,Does not contain any sparkling vampires,6,13 October 2014,"Quickie Review:As the Turks march to Transylvania, Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) faces the threat of losing his kingdom, wife, and son. In desperation Vlad seeks for power in the supernatural dark forces by accepting a deal with a vampire. As he battles his enemies he must also fight the darkness trying to consume him. Dracula Untold is a dark origin story of how Vlad became the infamous Dracula. There are several attempts at being deep and dramatic, but the film fails to achieve these goals. Despite that the movie is entertaining when purely focusing on the action and showcasing Dracula's power within the realm of the classic vampire lore. It's not great, but it's not bad either.Full Review:With recent renditions of vampire lore in cinema **cough** Twilight **cough** being very poor (putting it politely), my excitement for a vampire movie was minimal. What kept some hope was that this movie was going to be set in a faux history of the 1400s, and the focus would be only on Dracula as the major vampire. While there are some flaws to mention, for the most part it exceeded my expectations.Fortunately Dracula Untold's strongest aspect is the title character by Luke Evans. He balances the hero and monster characteristics of Dracula really well which is vital for an anti-hero. In that sense Dracula is multi-dimensional which certainly makes the character easier to empathize with. One of the more memorable parts is his encounter with the master vampire played by Charles Dance. I can't say that the rest of the cast lives up to the same standard, they are either functional or worse. On the worse end of the spectrum Dominic Cooper, which is surprising because he is a really talented actor in his other movies. However, in Dracula Untold it seems that Cooper is given very little to work with in the script and little screen time, leading him to appear as a very generic villain. If his character was more fleshed out, perhaps the filmmakers would have achieved more depth they were clearly striving for.The action for the most part is what makes this movie worth watching. Yes there is the occasional shaky cam obscuring some of the fights, but the final climatic fights are shown more cinematically. The visual effects help to display the most powerful Dracula on-screen yet. The scenes in between the fights on the other hand has some room for improvement in terms of pacing. Dracula Untold is so bogged down with trying to be serious and dramatic that we get some elongated scenes with the side characters. These scenes are meant to humanize Dracula, but instead it just makes you want to skip to the next scene.Overall I was satisfied with the movie. You will be too if you are only looking to have some fun popcorn action flick. If you go in expecting anything more than that you will be sorely disappointed. So keep that in mind when deciding to give it a shot in the cinema. Otherwise it is a good movie to stream on Netflix or other services once released.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Dracula Untold
111,elmoslively,Visually lavish.,7,27 January 2019,"Strong production design and cinematography are the main highlights of this otherwise laboured and overwrought film.

It has some good acting and is overall entertaining on a popcorn level.",Dracula Untold
112,CowherPowerForever,Let the Games Begin,7,1 November 2014,"As the release of this film came up, I was bombarded with trailers every time I turned on the television or went to a movie theater. I didn't enjoy the trailers, and frankly dreaded going to the theater recently in fear of seeing the awful trailer for the this. The release date came and went, and thankfully the television sorts and trailers went away. I found myself however recently being interested in the film for whatever reason. I knew the film was a watered down version of what could have been something nice, but I had this new found interest in seeing it. Thankfully I did, because I was pleasantly surprised. The following is my review of Dracula Untold.The film was written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, both who have their first writing credits on this film. This has come as somewhat of a shock to me because I felt the film was generally interesting and well written. Of course previous versions of Dracula are far better, but as a big time action film, it doesn't play out badly. The rating on this film also hurt what could have been something better. Vlad the Impaler was a vicious person, and having all of that in this film would have been great. The characters are written nicely, and play out perfectly. While the film definitely seems rushed in favor of something bigger(wink wink), it was overall a good fun action film with some acting that really helps out. In the end, Sazama and Sharpless do a good job of writing this film.The film was directed by Gary Shore who is also making his feature length debut on this film. The action is usually quick, but shot generally well. Nothing that bothers the eyes, for example a shaky cam. The scenes are generally very dark, but this plays out well for the film. As I mentioned above, one of the bigger problems I had was the rating the studio went with. No doubt they decided to go PG-13 for the extra cash, but I do wish Shore was allowed to make an all out gory action film with this great character. The acting is also an area that is key for a film, especially in a period piece like this. The star of the film playing Vlad(Dracula) is Luke Evans. Evans has been one of my favorite actors in recent years, and it was a joy to see him take on this role. Dominic Cooper takes on the villain role of Mehmed. Copper is another actor I enjoy watching. He really knows how to command the roles he picks, and the same can be said here. Sarah Gadon plays Vlad's wife, and I'm not too familiar with her work minus a few movies. She really does a good job in this film I must admit. With some good secondary actors like Charles Dance, the acting in this film is something that saves the movie from being barely above average. Overall, Shore gets a big thumbs up for the great directing as well as getting these actors to work so well on screen.Ramin Djawadi was the composer of this film, and his recent works were on films such as Fright Night, Safe House, and the 2013 hit Pacific Rim(one of my favorite scores for the record). I was glad to see he was scoring this film because I did in fact love his effort on Pacific Rim. While the type of score needed for this film was different than an all out action film, he adapts amazingly, and in return we get a fantastic score. I honestly have to put this score as one of the best scores of 2014. The score that Djawadi composed adds a great deal of depth to the film that makes it that much more enjoyable. Djawadi delivers a great score once again and most people like myself should enjoy it as well.In closing, this film caught me completely off guard. I hated the trailers and wanted them to stop prior to release, and after a couple weeks in release I finally broke down and paid to see the film in theaters. In the end I know I made the right choice. The film is hardly perfect, but it clicks well in my opinion. Those who like some good action mixed with some fabulous acting and an above average story should rush to see this film. Since it has been out for a couple weeks now, waiting for home video wouldn't be a bad idea either if you are trying to save money for bigger upcoming films. Either way, watching this film is a very good choice.7/10",Dracula Untold
113,CountVladDracula,Much better than I expected,9,12 October 2014,"So I just got done watching Dracula Untold. And to my surprise... I liked it. I really liked it.I'll start with what I didn't like about it before I get into what's good about it. First, there was one thing I liked in the original Dracula: Year Zero script I wish they had left in, his ability to become a wolf and mist. Here all we see is him transforming into a flock of bats but his ability to control the weather was nicely left in tact and made practical.Though in the original Stoker novel the sunlight could not kill Dracula I patiently looked the other way about that because he is a newborn vampire at this point in his story.Another part that bothered me was the idea that Dracula had previously killed for the Turks. This is not historically accurate but it really drives home the point that yes, he suffered as a child for The Ottoman Turks and yes the Turks did want young boy slaves to be used as soldiers or eunuchs for them.Now for the things I like: The plot is well paced. It moves quickly. It's well paced. It sheds the pretty boy vampire trend and balances a protagonist that is both predatory yet somewhat sympathetic. Now THIS is the type of vampire I have been waiting for! Let the trendy vampires that were polarized between broody pretty boys and mindless killing machines die! Long live Dracula! I like that unlike the early script this script acknowledges that Dracula was used to mean ""Son of the Dragon."" (until Dracula deliberately chose the darker meaning of the name.)I liked Caligula's twisted game of Hope vs. Despair and surprisingly Dracula was of the side of hope (while impaling entire armies!). I liked that Caligula was a Count Orlock-esque ugly SOB vampire. I liked his claws. I liked his dialogue. I liked him!I liked the use of real Vlad the Impaler history for the backstory. I liked the creative use of violent imagery while managing to maintain a PG-13 rating. I liked the subtle nods to other incarnations of Dracula such as the mad monk (or whatever he was) speaking like the 1931 Dwight Frye depiction of Renfield (character from the 1897 Dracula novel). Dwight Frye, as you may know, also played Fritz in the 1931 Frankenstein movie starring Boris Karloff and because of cultural consciousness merging these two characters together into ""Igor"" a lot of people mistakenly associate that dialogue from Frankenstein though it had it's origin in the Dracula novel and was never uttered by any character in the 1818 Frankenstein novel by Mary Shelley.Trivia: The name Igor was actually spelt Ygor and was the character portrayed by Bela Lugosi in Son of Frankenstein and Ghost of Frankenstein. The character had a damaged neck, not a crooked spine. Somehow the zeitgeist cultural consciousness changed how we perceived him. The mad man that calls Dracula ""master"" was Renfield and that has it's origins in Bram Stoker's original 1897 Dracula novel.I loved that there was even a subtle quoting of the song Life after Life from Frank Wildhorn's Dracula The musical (one of my favorite depictions of Dracula).This film had an almost Fred Saberhagen feel to it and I actually liked it a lot.I particularly adored the new ending. That was a LOT more satisfying than the ending of the early script. This is definitely going on my list of top twenty Dracula films.Sorry for any typos, I'm typing at a mile a minute. I'm gitty from the euphoria that finally after years of waiting there was a truly good Dracula film again. My biggest complaint is that I miss the wolf and mist transformations from the early script. Those were excellent powers. Other than that this was a fantastic depiction of Dracula.",Dracula Untold
114,ahegde3149,"A typical action-fantasy, slightly better comparing with recent additions to the genre",4,14 February 2015,"Dracula Untold is for fantasy fans craving for CGI-action sequences without much regard to the depth of the story. Honestly I do not care whether the things portrayed were historically accurate or even the plausibility of the events. I just expected a clichéd fantasy adventure involving vampires and other monsters, considering that the film was just mediocre. Well, this one is considerably better than the likes of 'I, Frankenstien' or 'The Legend of Hercules' of 2014 still its far from a good film.Luke Evans plays Vlad Tepes (also famous as Vlad the Impaler) who returns to his homeland Transylvania after serving in Turkish empire. Mehmed (Dominic Cooper), the Turkish king decides he wants more recruits from Transylvania and demands Vlad's son to be included among them. Raged by this demand plus not having enough force for war Vlad makes a deal with the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) giving him extraordinary powers of a vampire. There is one catch though Vlad must resist his temptation for blood or else he remain a vampire forever. Is he able to control his desires or ends up sucking someones blood? Watch yourself.While the film is briskly paced and the short run-time of around 90 minutes is really a positive still many things are quite bland. The film feels like a bad mix-up between PG-13 vampire violence and superhero action sequences. The CGI is good, but is that a special thing nowadays? The cast is great and give believable performances if not Oscar-worthy. The screenplay had a lot of potential specially with vampire-aspects which lack enough development. There is severe lack of violence with its family friendly PG-13 rating but this made the action sequences loose a considerable amount of credibility. Overall I must say Dracula Untold is an average movie which will loved fans of its genre, others won't be much amused.RATING: [2/5]",Dracula Untold
115,The_moan_of_all_moans,Some stories are best left Untold.,4,1 November 2014,"With the spooky, captivating cover version of ""Everybody wants to rule the World"" blaring out in the trailers, it would be very easy (as it was for me)to succumb to some sort of anticipation. It is Dracula after all, one of the - if not THE- greatest, most iconic monsters ever. However...when the credits rolled and the aforementioned optimism had been completely drained from my body, I couldn't help but feel like i had been duped. This is a clear case of integrating a legendary creation into a soul-less storyline. Ten minutes in, it has lost a mass of distinction. Although the vampire issue was there, it was basically like every other film with swords and shields. There's a battle, Then, of course there has to be some topless action showing scars and battle wounds,(my heart bleeds, it truly does)a cheesy, romantic gesture, (although if i dragged my girlfriend into a bath, i would get pulverized) then there's my favorite. Everyone merrily feasting, only to be disrupted by an angry group of men, who are clearly outraged that they where each given change of a 20 (all coins) and forced to jingle their way around the dining area. It is the same old clichés. And apart from a couple of bats, there's not much to differentiate it from films from that genre. In 1992, Gary Oldman pretty much did all there was you could do with Dracula. It wasn't a masterpiece of a film, but it was great and it did the job. There just seems to be a drought of originality these days. Dipping their greedy fingers into the past, just to make money; not to make a classic film. Frankenstein fell victim, and now so has Dracula.",Dracula Untold

117,The_Celluloid_Sage,Entertaining if ultimately average with a weak Evans,6,6 April 2020,"In this, the last of the modern Universal monster remakes before they start their own shared universe consisting of the The Mummy, Wolfman, Van Helsing and others (no doubt due to the recent success of Marvel's Cinematic Universe) we have the story of a young Vlad III (played rather weakly by Evans) in the fifteenth century.We open to a quick monologue giving us a back story to the Christian-Turk wars involving the Templar's and the effects of the lengthy conflicts. In fourteen forty-two, ten years after Vlad has returned from servitude to the Turkish, Vlad's lands are at an uneasy peace with his former captives. Nothing is said of Vlad's father, nor how he returned.While out looking for scouts, Vlad and two of his closest happen upon a fissure in a cave. Upon entering the cave they meet the resident creature (Charles Dance) who quickly dispatches with Vlad's associates and is only stopped by Vlad crawling to the caves entrance, which is bathed in sunlight. Vlad then seeks out the local holy man to learn more about this monster. Naturally the peace between the Turks does not last and Vlad takes desperate measures to protect those he loves.The overall problem with this film though is that it's just not very good, despite its budget. Now don't get me wrong, the movie is certainly enjoyable and fast-paced enough to keep you interested, but it has numerous other issues which befall it. Luke Evans while a reasonable actor, comes across as a weak, camp Orlando Bloom (if that's actually possible). He is just far too soft-voiced, pretty and basically unassuming to play such a strong historical character.The script is also a major issue in my opinion. Quite often the dialogue is shockingly laughable (though not to the extent of the terribly written Bram stokers Dracula to be fair). The camerawork and photography are also not the greatest, though I will say there are some fantastic single shots littered throughout the film. I'm not sure why there was such inconsistency. There are however some nice effects and despite the blatant use of CGI, the big battle scenes are visually quite impressive.Given it was almost 20 years before Universal started making these again and will only be a few years since the last lot of reboots, it will be interesting to see how a modern audience reacts to these remade classics. To be fair to this title, they do try to be a little inventive with the setting, era and story, and overall this is an enjoyable, if not a great film.

118,YJLcool,A horror action film that doesn't live up to its expectations,5,2 October 2014,"There's nothing new about Dracula Untold. Unfortunately, it's just another film that favours spectacle and style over substance. With a film clocked in at a mere 85 minutes (excluding credits), the story is just not compelling enough for the audience to invest emotionally in what happens next. There's simply not enough time and everything felt rushed without proper character development.In the beginning of the film, we're swiftly introduced to our main character, Vlad the Impaler with a series of montage about his background, what he did for the Turkish empire and why he was renowned for his brutality in warfare. Basically, he's a 15-century Transylvanian prince infamous for his practice of impaling his enemies to induce fear and ensure the safety of his people and kingdom. Unfortunately, the Sultan of the Turkish Empire demands 1000 of the young boys in his kingdom to join his army to conquer Europe. Unable to comply, outnumbered and face an imminent threat from the Turkish army, he decides to make a deal with an arch vampire demon, Caligula, at a price, to grant him power to destroy his enemies.The action scenes are stylish, cool and surprisingly not too violent, scary or gory, which fits the intention of establishing Dracula as an anti-hero instead of a frightening monster villain. The best action scene is where we get to see Vlad summons a colony of bats to defeat the 10,000-strong Turkish army during the climactic battle. It is truly a sight to behold but ultimately it fails to impress as everything just happens too fast.There are some fine performances from its actors, especially Luke Evans. He did the best he could in a film with a bad script. Many of the supporting characters are severely underdeveloped and completely forgettable. We don't know much about them aside from watching them appear on screen talking a few lines here and there before getting killed. None of them have enough screen time for their characters to make a memorable, lasting impression on screen, including the main antagonist, Sultan Mehmed II. We've being told that the Sultan and Vlad were close like brothers and yet we never get to see this relationship on screen at all. We don't know much about him at all. Not to mention, even the origins of Caligula, the vampire demon who sired Vlad is quickly briefed through without slowing down.The film never bothered to fully explore its premise...the ultimate price Vlad had to 'pay' (his humanity) for becoming a vampire to save his people, family and kingdom. It doesn't truly show what a 'monster' he had become in order to win the war against the Turks. Furthermore, the film doesn't take time to establish the characters well. Because of that, the film has lost its potential. Overall, Dracula Untold is just not worth the price of admission. A forgettable film.Rating: 5/10",Dracula Untold
119,georgecoffeynewyorker,"Spectacular, Music and of course the Bat Scene",9,2 November 2014,"Well what to say about this film. It blew me off my mind. Blew my jockstraps off - hahaha. I most looked forward to all the time, the fight scenes. It was absolutely heaven to watch. Bottomline, the plot being, Vlad(Evans) along with his mates, encounter a dark force of supernatural forces in the form of The Master Vampire(Dance). We are introduced first to a ""history"" lesson kinda thing which I can now reveal that actually Vlad was taken in by the Turds. Then afterwards, his two men are killed by The Master Vampire. A few years on, Vlad is trying to beat an army full of Turds. While at a dinner, Vlad being the Prince of the Kingdom, is forced by the Turds to confront Mehmed(Cooper). Mehmed reveals that he wants a 1,000 men to join the Turds, ie History is repeating itself. So Vlad to get help turns to The Master Vampire - claiming: ""I'll find a way"". He has a confrontation. The Master Vampire says: ""How supremely noble"", when Vlad returns back to the supernatural forces. While asking The Master Vampire for help, Vlad cunningly says ""Men do not fear swords, they fear monsters"". Continuing ""Sometimes the world no longer needs a hero, sometimes what it needs is a monster"". The Vampire reacts harshly ""and you believe you know what it is to be a monster"". He convinces Vlad to drink his blood and is NOW Dracula. Vlad will have ""the strength of a hundred men, speed of a falling star"". So he goes on fighting and fighting with extra powers with Bats etc., Then the Turks want 1000 men and the Prince's who is now Dracula's son. So he is even more enraged, and more fighting ensues. Then so that he can get extra help, he then ""converts"" some of his allies to Vampires. When they were about to ""change"" his son Ingeras(Parkinson) to a vampire. Vlad/Dracula didn't want this so he sent the Monk with the son. A few years later, we learn the Son has become the Prince as the father Vlad had ""died"". Then we later learn that he was reincarnated by The Monk, if I can recall rightly. Vlad was given 3days by the Master Vampire to do his job and defeat the army of Turks. When the 3rd day was up, sadly the Princess went. And she gave him permission to live on as a Vampire ie Dracula. So he bites her to become a Vampire. He was told to resist blood, and that if he actually got into the blood, that he would be permanent as a Vampire. Oh he resisted alrite. So then what an ending we were given. The Master Vampire became ""whole"" again. And left us with a a chilling line in a modern city: ""Let the games begin"". Bottomline, fantastic.Then the last scene of where the scene has now int he MODERN era. Vlad meets another woman Ima. And Dance being Master Vampire claims: ""Let the games begin"". I find that FASCINATING.",Dracula Untold
120,indiedavid,Lighten up people,7,1 November 2014,"I had to write a review to rebut the morons who are so ridiculous that they criticize this film because it is ""historically inaccurate""..REALLY people? A vampire film is historically inaccurate? Wow, what a revelation. Thanks for the reality check. Using known figures in history to craft a fictional film isn't exactly unprecedented. Have you sheltered fools ever heard of ""Forrest Gump""? Well, using your standards of cinematic truth, I am here to expose the film as a fraud. Forrest Gump didn't really bring down Richard Nixon and it's time the global film community was made aware of this fact. By the way, while we are at it, the Sioux Nation have absolutely no record of Lt. John Dunbar and the record books show absolutely no indication of a dramatic love triangle aboard the Titanic. Please get a life people. There are other things to worry about in contemporary society. And in my opinion, this film was outstanding!",Dracula Untold
121,RetroRick,"Historically accurate, except in relation to the factsg",7,8 November 2014,"There's a lot going for Dracula Untold. But before you can enjoy what is essentially a pretty good action flick in the sword and sorcery genre you may first have to overcome some significant but not insuperable niggles. There's a good reason its called Dracula Untold and that is because it never happened. At least not that way.This new imagining of the Dracula myth tries not entirely unsuccessfully to meld the Bram Stoker myth with the historical inspiration of the same. The fact that Stoker's tale of a supernatural being dwelling in Transylvania has absolutely nothing to do with the real history of Vlad the dragon Dracul doesn't really help the attempt to twine together the two stories. Still the writers certainly try their best, and given the difficulty of the task they don't do an absolutely dire job.Now don't misunderstand me, this is a quite good movie. Its enjoyable. The pace is great. Even the historical background is handled pretty well, given that it is basically a fantasy superimposed on real historical events. Ultimately the project to bring the supernatural myth together with the historical reality doesn't work, but that doesn't really stop it being an enjoyable movie and supernatural action flick. It just means that the film is better than the idea its based upon, and its a credit to the cast, direction and pacing that we find ourselves forgiving this for the most part.What I find most difficult though, although I completely understand why it was done, was the fact that the writers turn Vlad into the kind of guy we can root for. It seems that for Romanians Vlad is something of a national hero, despite his simply dreadful deeds. I imagine how they, as a nation, achieve that is done in rather the same way as the writers, namely by giving him a good whitewash. This Vlad is a guy who's done a lot of terrible things, including by his own admission thousands of impalings, but hes done them for the greater good. He is in other words a utilitarian impaler. Impaling scares the Turks. Scaring the Turks is good. Hence, its a pretty pro-social all things considered. Now there may well be some sense in which Vlad the Impaler did his impaling out of a sense of nationalist duty, or civic duty, but to suggest that he is a nice guy, really doesn't wash. The guy was an absolute sadist; one of the simply nastiest guys in history. Is that established beyond doubt. well not necessarily. Unfortunately Vlad is known to us, mainly through his enemies and detractors, of whom he had quite a few. Its quite possible that they made him worse that he in fact was, however even allowing for that I am pretty sure he was a sadist. Unless pretty much everything about what he did was made up, the guy was a sadist, and therefore this film, and probably the whole Romanian nationalist view of who Vlad was, is a white-wash.The vampire elements, actually work quite well, but again, the whole tortured vampire thing is a bit overdone. Interiew with a vampire is a far better movies about humanising vampires. I would much have preferred something closer to what Vlad really was. The guy was a bad boy. The whole romantic, sub-plot could have been dispensed with, and turned into a revenge movie, and you would have got a less feel good, but better and more raw movie. Dracula, & Vlad the Impaler, are both dark tales, one a fable, the other based on a true historical story. To try to humanise and indeed christianise both feels like a missed opportunity. It would have been far better to have presented a nasty guy, with a slight sliver of decency or humanity, rather than a basically nice guy who impales for the public good, and sucks blood for love not money.Those slight gripes aside, its a really enjoyable action flick, with very white looking Turks, and impeccably English romanians. If there is a follow up I'd probably take a look.",Dracula Untold
122,e-m-hobo,"A different, interesting, and ever so entertaining take on Dracula",10,4 January 2020,"Did anyone disregard the title? And the history thing... Why do people look at history? It isn't historical fiction.One thing I've had to learn to let go of is watching movies with premonitions. Every movie you decide to watch, turn off all of your expectations and just let the movie be the movie.I give a lot of ten star reviews, it's true, but I tend to stick to what I want to see nowadays and it isn't impossible to please me. Perfect movie : 9 stars. Drags me in and has me engaged, also completely feeling the main character, add the last star. Sometimes, when it feels distant to me because it's psychologically impossible even though it's supposed to be the real world, it knocks off a star even though perfectly made, even when it means to criticize the fact that this is the way some people see themselves.We seem to be going through the Platinum age of movies and we've been doing so for over a decade now.This movie appeals to you from a point of view of classic Hollywood romance with a classical Hollywood hero. I wouldn't call him a male Kathryn Hepburn, but hey, he's got class and it stands as such in this movie instead of criticize it like Luke Evans sometimes gets to do. He's an awful lot of fun to watch, quite possibly because behind the most wonderful and rich Hollywood-veneer he comes off as a bit of a scoundrel.I don't know whether I'm right or wrong, but throw in Sarah Gadon as his love and I do the one thing that I don't typically do : look up their names and remember them. Now, I really loved the movie and so should you. If you don't mind, I'm also going to check out the rest of the cast, because they really did do a formidable job.Don't forget : only watch movies without premonitions. And enjoy a little kickback to old school Hollywood romance and action with lots of magic and blood as you watch this one. Great movie.",Dracula Untold
123,teutonfirst,"Flaws, bats and flaws everywhere",4,9 November 2014,"Dunno where to start so I'll start with the beginning. Vlad was never ruling Transylvania. He was ruling Valahia, the southern part of Romania, known as Oltenia. His tribute to the sultan was in gold, 10.000 gold pieces to be more precise. His seat was in Targoviste. OK, enough history. Now since the action takes place in Transylvania, which is in north, and the Turks come from the south, why the hell are they retreating south to Cozia ??? To meet the Turks I presume, so the action can take place (big smile). The fighting was meh, I've seen better action in B grade movies. But the final scene was hilarious. So there is Vlad's army firing arrows and stuff, then out of nowhere 3 Turks get to his wife and son, kill one soldier and the whole army is gone ... Then he flies to save his wife, falls down with her (no comment in that scene is needed), and by the time they struck the ground, his son made it all the way from monastery to the Turks camp, which was pretty far away, on foot... teleportation isn't a myth I guess. I had high hopes regarding this movie, but, for me, it was a disappointment.",Dracula Untold

125,amiranda-39274,Let the Games Begin,7,2 November 2020,"Dracula Untold is one of my favorite vampire movies, and I fear it has gone underappreciated, not only does this movie impress me enough to write this review, I feel it deserved more recognition, since it is one of the best retellings of Dracula's origin.Characters:
Vlad is a very well written character, but perhaps not the kind of Dracula you would expect. Despite being raised by the Ottoman empire to be a killing machine and the titled "" Impaler"", he shows a level of humanity you wouldn't expect from such a man. he is shown to be a good husband, father and king, in fact everything he does in the movie is selfless and noble, to the point you don't question that he would sacrifice his soul for his people. But i fear they made this Dracula too likeable, because as he struggles through the movie to remain human, you actually want him to succeed, which adds to the tragedy. Sarah Gordon as Dracula's supportive wife, is absolutely gorgeous and really brings out the best in Vlad, together her and luke evans have some of the best romantic dialogue and are believable as a couple. But the man who steals the show, is Tywin Lannister himself, Charles Dance, who only has a few minutes onscreen, but is completely memorable as the master vampire, he has the best dialogue in the movie and is truly terrifying. While the king of the ottoman empire is a vile villain hes more of an obstacle for Vlad than an actual archenemy, but with more screen time I'm sure he could have been more compelling. In fact i think every character in this movie could have used more screen time since almost every character was interesting from Vlad's royal advisor to the priest, they have the makings of being great character but just lack the correct screen time, especially Charles Dance.Dialogue: The writing for this movie is truly compelling and profound, the very idea of a man giving up his humanity protect what he loves has never been done so good like in this story. Through clever dialogue we understand vlad was a child soldier and refuses to give up his son to that lie, even willing to make a deal with the devil. What's most interesting about that is that vlad is determined for salvation, since he only has to go 3 days without drinking human blood. You see him struggle but persevere, as he discusses with his wife how God can still forgive him, since is his goals are pure, but sadly good intentions sometimes pave the road to hell.The Music: The music in this movie is positively spinetingling, being dark and gothic, classic Dracula. I even play the soundtrack every Halloween, i recommend you listen to ""The Brood"", it will make you afraid.Cinematography: The visuals are gorgeous in this movie, the atmosphere is positively gothic. i will admit the only times when this movie looks weird is when CGI is heavily used such as during the war scenes.Action: Like i just said the weakest part of this movie is the action, while it is most certainly ambitious, the cgi used for the large battles misses the mark. Vlad fighting an army of a 1000 soldiers by himself is badass, its so distorted and clunky you cant really enjoy the fight scenes, which is why I'm sure the creators kept the fights so short and why they added impressive CGI effects to distract you. Anytime Vlad is displaying his powers, the effects are done simply but impressively. The final battle between the ottoman empire and the vampire army is however the best fight in the movie, watching Vlad's former subjects massacre the ottomans is both satisfying and horrifying to watch.Dark Universe: The movie ends on a very compelling cliffhanger, with vlad being in modern day and Charles dance being close by saying ""Let the Games begin"". And to be honest, i still wish a sequel had been made to this. Luke Evans was born to play Dracula, Charles Dance makes such a amazing villain, in fact hes the main reason i want a sequel so badly, just to see more of him as the master vampire. I feel this movie didn't deserve to be shunned as a pathetic popcorn action movie, this movie has atmosphere and charisma. While its tru there are some clunky moments here and there it has nothing to do with the acting or writing. I feel this is the movie that should have started the dark universe, imagine Dracula a the Tony stark/captain America of his monster steam. granted while the dark universe was too pretentious for its own good, I feel they could have built off of this movie and its sequel. Well never know.
I honesty don't consider tis the same traditional Dracula like Bela lagosi or Christopher lee, hes just too noble, but this Dracula will most certainly still compel you to do its bidding....And that is to give this review a like. Happy Halloween Folks!",Dracula Untold
126,dagallop,PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE watch this without the 'Dracula' impresion!,10,21 October 2018,"This movie frankly came as something as a shock, a good one though!I really didn't expect much from this movie, another Dracula movie but, that is as far from being the case as Alien was just another horror movie. The entire thing, scenes, photography, acting and sound was out of this world. I have no idea how this movie slipped by for so long before I got to see it and now I wish I had known what I know now then, because this would have been a must on the big screen.The special effects are better than some of the exceptionally high budget movies and frankly were faultless. Add the best acting I have seen in this genre of movie for a considerable time with the 'everything else about this movie' and you will absolutely be entertained and hopefully as impressed as was I.Ironically I didn't realize that it was Charles Dance to start with, someone as notable as he should have not escaped by notice but that is actually a testimony to the makeup and special effects. Luke Evans was so well placed in the lead role that I am even more surprised that we don't see him in some of the Marvel movies, he would be make a superb super hero or bad guy!Gary Shore should have won an oscar for the directing, if there is one thing that will fail an entire movie it is the directing, again excellent performances from all involved can only be credited to good direction. So two thumbs up there.In conclusion, watch this movie as if you have no idea about any of the Dracula stories that you may have seen, I guarantee that you will be as thrilled, riveted and fulfilled as was I.",Dracula Untold
127,shinsrevenge,Innovative version of the Dracula movies,9,19 June 2015,"Just watched Dracula Untold and I enjoyed every moment of it. Be it the great special effects, the story or the good acting performance. The only reason why it didn't get 10/10 is because it really felt like it was too short.Dracula Untold tells the story of Vlad, who is forced to take the path to vampirism in order to achieve the strength to save his land and people, above all his son. The movie shows his struggle to stay human and preserve his humanity. It's so good written that you get excited when he storms into battle, using all his powers to annihilate the enemies. And when one of his dear friends die it will concern you too. It is impressive that they managed to get you attached to the characters in such a short playtime, but it just shows how great this movie is.I'm no historian. I've read complains about the movie not being historically correct as well as being called anti-islamistic. As for the first: It's a movie. Not a documentation. And since it's about vampires we shouldn't even start to complain about facts.As for the later: Since when do fictional works about vampires have to be politically correct? Many movies have their antagonists and they are often portrayed as villains. Nothing wrong with that. Besides it really didn't feel like Dracula Untold was trying to stir hatred up. No need to feel offended.",Dracula Untold
128,matej-trkanjec-133-920386,A title no one seems to understand,7,10 October 2014,"Leaving the cinema last night I found myself arguing with half the audience about the movie. Half of them said the movie sucked, and the other half (myself included) loved it. Now, this is a type of movie that will divide the audience so much that there will not be a middle. One will either love it or hate it (which seems to be a pattern in recent Hollywood history). By just watching the trailer it was clear as day that this will not be a masterpiece or a rebirth of Stocker's fable. So I ask a very plausible question: What did you expect?1) The acting. This is a prototype of how a star is born. Luke Evans was by far the best choice for the lead role. His dark and passionate portrait of the prince was staggering. He was believable in every scene from start to finish. The changes of his character were so sophisticated and cool that only after the movie ends one actually realizes what a good performance that was. Evans is the only one that equals the '92 Gary Oldman performance. Cooper on the other hand used as a great counter performance showing just how bad his acting really is. That only emphasized Evans' performance. It was noticeable that the director felt the same way and gave him just a couple of scenes in the movie. Though, the end fight between the two was interesting, in my opinion it was more to the character and wardrobe than Cooper's performance. Two young actors of which one has, and will have a great career - Evans. Dance had an interesting role, but nothing worth praising. The rest of the cast I felt just filled the space and did a decent job. 2) The story. Unlike the stories so far (unfortunately there have been a lot) this one takes us far back to the very beginning, to the origins. It is innovative, and interesting to see how the story reveals itself. This is what the ones who don't like the movie don't like the most. Everyone expected a classic Dracula story and bloodsucking and London and Van Helsing etc. This is something else and accept it as it is. A good fantasy action movie with great visual effects, good acting and a decent story. The story has a nice paste, it is a great combination of slow sequences and action. But, the true problem with the movie is the length. 93 min is way to short for a movie of this type. If it were 30 min longer the characters could have been explored more, the story could have had more drama, and the ending could have been longer and bloodier. But this length shows that a nice story with enough drama, suspense, action and a bit gore, can be told in 90 min. We are, unfortunately spoiled by all the big spectacles lasting over 120 min, so 90 min can seem a bit short.3) The visual effects. By far the most memorable part (besides Evans). They are dark, brutal and entertaining. It is a joy to watch and it always leaves one sitting and waiting to see what Dracula will come up with next. And yes, the burning on the sun is very believable and quite gruesome.I have said a lot about this movie so far and most of it was good. This movie has its flaws - the length, the story holes, the lack of a good antagonist... One could really go on for days. But that is not the point. What matters is that Dracula untold provided exactly what it said it would - a great ride. It will not be a huge box office hit, it will not win an Acadamy award. But people will see it, they will have a good time go home and forget about it. That is exactly what Dracula is - 90 min of good entertainment. Not everything has to be The Shawshank Redemption or the Godfather. And most importantly, not every Dracula story has to be R rated and a pure horror movie. So, go see it, expect a fun ride, and you will enjoy it.",Dracula Untold
129,slayerjmk95,An Intense but Sadly Underdeveloped Epic,7,7 October 2014,"Dracula Untold is the re-imagining of the classic Hollywood vampire, from Universal Pictures. Vlad III (Luke Evans) learns of Mehmed II and his plans to ""recruit"" young men into his thousand-strong army, including Vlad's son Ingeras. Searching for a way to protect his family and his kingdom, Vlad encounters the Master Vampire (Charles Dance), who imbues Vlad with the powers and weaknesses of a vampire, giving him the chance to save all he knows and loves. But, he has only three days to either use the power and watch it fade away, or become a vampire for eternity if he gives in to the thirst.Dracula Untold was and is a surprisingly sleek and fast-paced tale of love and courage, but because of its pace, it seems like the big themes and moments of the film rush by all too quickly. That's not to say the film is bad; Luke Evans is perfect as Dracula, who is charismatic, brooding and commanding when on-screen (the supporting cast is fantastic as well), the visual effects are dazzling, the music is perfect and Gary Shore's direction isn't spot-on, but gives the film a wonderfully sleek and gorgeous look. It's the script (as usual) that needed some hefty work. It's not that there was an overabundance of cheesiness or clichés (although there were a few of those), everything just seemed 'mashed' together. If someone like Frank Darabont or even Alex Garland added to the script, giving it say fifteen to twenty minutes more, the movie could have been great. But alas, it's simply good at best.Boasting its visual prowess and grit over story-telling, Dracula Untold is neither bad nor great. If you want a fun, intense ride, see Dracula Untold (preferably in IMAX). Just lower your expectations for the film as a whole, while Luke Evans certainly deserves great attention.",Dracula Untold
130,Kingkitsch,This Dracula story should have remained untold.,4,1 April 2015,"What a stinking pile of bat guano this movie is! Yes, it's completely inaccurate historically, but the real crime here is the tidal wave of foolishness on display. Let's take a look at a few things that made this entire enterprise so ridiculous. 1. Dracula evidently has a private home gym or he works out on the rack in the dungeon. Let's make sure we get to ogle Luke Evans' six- pack, close up. 2. Dracula has a wife who's pretty much horny most of the time. Their son looks like a young Kristy MacNicol with a bitchin' 70s hairdo. Everyone has a different accent. Evidently the son went to Eaton at some point. Dracula uses anachronistic slang like the word ""Okay"". 3. Only about 100 or so people live in Transylvania. 4. The Sultan Mehmed as played by Dominic Cooper is awash in so much eye shadow and mascara he can barely keep his eyes open. Whoever gave him that West Hollywood haircut laughed all the way to the bank. 5.Transylvania and Middle Earth are the same place. Or maybe the action took place in the forest outside Hogwarts. Harry's stag patronus makes a nice cameo. 6. Everyone has perfect teeth, perfectly trimmed beards, and have clean clothes. 7. The swarms of bats are dangerously close to the swarms of bees you used to see in Looney Tunes cartoons. You know, they can make shapes and stuff. 8. The whole business with the vampire in the cave is never really explained, making the ""modern"" appearance of the thing completely confusing. 9.

The story is neither something fresh nor there is anything being untold, but more to divert from the original dead-less appearance of this character into domestication, insanity over power and merciless war to control over another land. The trailer promises some great actions and effects but when it comes to the full presentation, the awful CGIs and setting visualization are more worse than 300: Rise of an Empire. Towards the ending, it feels like the film develops into some Twilight affairs and the intention to have possible sequel is totally unnecessary, wasting the overall efforts to make this film.",Dracula Untold
132,MajorBaleegh,Biggest Joke With History,5,22 November 2014,"The movie ""Dracula Untold"" was a good movie if keeping in mind the entertainment point of view, however apart from that it was just a fantasy and a fairytale and nothing else, the way the director foretold the story and unwrap the pages of history that portrayed that the Turk's were the bad guys and the Christian's were the good one, whereas the history told a bitter story, it was other way round and as the movie was produced and made by a Christian by faith so it should what he thought was liked by the audience but from the Muslim's perspective would be completely different. It was not happened what was shown here, it's total absurd and clotting the mind of the young generation who knew very less of the history of Arabian Peninsula or for that matter about the 15th century Europe; using of Turk's in the European folklore was a really bad idea which should have been avoided to hurt the feelings of the Muslim community.I am a regular movie watcher and what change I am experiencing in the movies of the past seven years or so almost in all of the movies, the hatred is clearly seen among Muslim's by the west which is not encouraging neither entertaining. Movies were an entertainment platform but these days it is being used as a propaganda service like it used to be in the 30ths or 40ths used excessively in the world wars and the same is being reflected here which is shattering the image of the cinema. Making a folklore and degrading the Muslim community is not a good effort rather it showed the hatred in the mind of westerner's against a religion and its followers which should be avoided to attract more number of viewers so make a movie a success.I will rate this movie 5 out of 10, as it should have been a Dracula movie, rather it was a disgrace of Muslim's of 15th century and more so the old Dracula told him to stay strong whereas the new Dracula was more of a magician than a Dracula and he was using bats as a magic wand and killing Turk's like birds, and the funniest part was when one Dracula killed entire 1000 soldiers I think it was too much for a Dracula to perform keeping in mind he was Dracula and not some fire breathing dragon. It was too much a long shot which was very difficult to comprehend and was beyond possibility. For westerners it might be an entertainment but for Muslim's it was a sheer disgrace.",Dracula Untold

Special effects were nicely balanced ! One thing remain unsolved. there is no explanation on who is the mysterious forest vampire... and where did he come from.",Dracula Untold
137,honeybloggs-69648,Surprisingly Fantastic !,9,22 January 2020,"I read the reviews on IMDb and expected it to be lame but decided to watch it as hey ....it's Dracula !
I was pleasantly surprised as it was really good ! The acting was great, the action and CGI were really good too!
Luke Evans played the role perfectly . He was strong , powerful, regal , kind, masculine, masterful , monster like , and ....sexy! He captured his struggle not to drink blood well. The way he moved when he ' turned' was brilliant .
The movie critics often get it wrong and this time they definitely did ! This movie is great ! I'm so glad I gave it a chance and watched it!",Dracula Untold
138,bostonct,Historically wrong but it was a fun movie,8,11 March 2015,"What's going on with vampire movies? Was it 2011 or 2012 they made Abraham Lincoln, vampire killer? What next, Chairman Mao and the white army vampires? Or how about Aliens versus Predators versus Vampires? This is where education may be getting overrun by movies. They need to put a disclaimer in the beginning of these mutations so people don't think it's historically correct. Hell,just about every so-call ""based on a true story"" is incorrect so they probably should start doing it now. But I do like the variance into an alternate universe. It really allows your imagination to go wild. In this one, the acting was actually pretty good, very visual scenes and overall a fun movie to watch.",Dracula Untold

140,FallsDownz,"""Dracula Untold has a potential but it's just failed almost completely""",5,20 October 2014,"So Dracula Untold is another Fantasy movie that talks about the Lore or maybe Legend of Dracula , this movie reminds me of I,Frankenstein though (and that movie is really bad) but i have to say the source is interesting , i mean the Dracula story is a cool story and can be really good ""if"" they do it right.But unfortunately Dracula Untold is not up to par , it's a movie that has a lot of problem for example the movie take it self very very serious yet they don't give enough time for the story or even characters to grown a lot of time just spend on mediocre Action scene which makes the movie feels boring if you want to go serious then stop having this much action scene in 90 minutes movie because it will makes your story really bad.Another thing that this movie failed really hard is characters i mean the Dracula is cool but the others is just really really bad , they're just so boring cliché characters that you've seen a hundred times already and some are even worse , like the bad guy is just a bad guy with no reason why at all another characters that just boring and annoying is Dracula wife and son not only they're so bland and boring the movie just force and try so hard to make us care about them but it's just don't work and that's make both characters even worst.The Action scene is fine in this movie it's really really ""over the top"" action scene for sure but it's pretty entertaining at least .Also the cinematography is pretty great in Dracula Untold there's a lot of beautiful scene so i have to give cinematographer and this movie credit.The Lead actor Luke Evans who play as Dracula , he's pretty good in this movie in fact he's the only person in this movie who actually interesting you kind a care about him a bit .Overall i have to say that this is another wasted of opportunity for Dracula story i really like the idea of taking it very serious but the problem is the Director just doesn't have enough experience to know how to tell the story properly and in the end it's just end up messy , Dracula Untold is a pretty mediocre movie that you can just skip.",Dracula Untold
141,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Dracula Untold Review,6,8 October 2014,"My Thoughts: This is one of those fall movies that I have been looking forward to. I have read Bram Stokers Dracula as a teenager. I love Vampire stories. Unfortunately in this day and age we have had so many retelling of the Dracula story as well as an influx of Vampire stories that almost any original plots are left out there.What they are trying to give us here is a look at Dracula Origins. Vlad was forced to train as a Turk soldier as a kid and rose to have a fearful reputation as Vlad the Impaler and finally earned his freedom to go back home to Transylvania. For ten years there was peace between the Turks and Transylvania with the occasional submitting of tribute. But then things changed and the Sultan wants Transylvania to send their kids to once again become soldiers in the Turkish Army. Of course this does not sit well with Prince Vlad and he is determined to find a way to protect his family and country.I am not going to sugar coat it for you the story is weak and the choices made are really made to push Vlad into becoming the man we know him to become. There are just some ridiculous moments in this movie where you just have to blink and go that wouldn't work in the real world (Yes I know I am watching a Vampire movie) or smart people making a decision that goes against what they have been preaching for most of the movie.But what this movie does have going for it is the special effects. I loved how they showed Vlad getting accustomed to his new found powers, it wasn't ""oh look I can now crush a rock"" but an amazed ""oh now that is useful"" kind of thing. And we get the full range of Vampire powers from strength, to animal control, to transformation. As well as his many weaknesses.This movie is ballsy as well in that they did set themselves up for a sequel so they are already thinking ahead.My Recommendation:If you want to see this in the theaters catch an early show.",Dracula Untold
142,CrisMovieCorner,Vlad is back!,8,17 November 2014,"The reboot in the Universal Monsters franchise we all (well at least me) have been waiting for, and they decided to start with THE ultimate movie monster Dracula. This franchise comes at the right time, just when cinematic universes are on the up and up, and the Universal Monsters was and still is one of the most enjoyable franchises to date.Luke Evans truly carried this film from start to end, that is not to say that everybody else was poor, just that Evans was a complete and utter standout in his role as Vlad Tepes. He truly came across as an emotionally driven man willing to do absolutely anything for his family and people, even if that meant the ultimate sacrifice of himself. The progression that Vlad has throughout the film was great, he went from Prince of a calm and quiet land to the head of his own domineering army.With that all being said about Evans, doesn't mean I didn't enjoy other performances, Charles Dance for one was brilliant as Master Vampire, a truly terrifying performance I'm hoping will continue for more instalments in the franchise. I will say Cooper's character of Mehmed was a little bland in the way that there wasn't much progression on his behalf, however a bit bland he was played well by Cooper.I'm a huge fan of the vampiric subgenre of Horror, but found it be getting a little diluted with boring modern relationship driven stories and forgetting about the true nature of the greatest movie monster of all time. This film is a brilliant mixture of both, while we get to see the emotional struggle of becoming such a creature, we also get to see how a man striving to protect his world can use his now animalistic attributes to fight many men especially in that scene when he defeats an army and casually walks back to his people like he done nothing. ""Men don't fear swords. They fear monsters"".The cinematography was brilliant, it was a beautiful film to watch, it had a very artistic feel to it all the scenes made sense like they themselves were part of the story. There is a fair amount of computer generated scenes, but that's a given for the type of film it is, I usually advocate for practical over computer effects when possible. However, within this film the CG if the right approach it adds so much to the story, when Vlad flicks into bat mode to move quicker is phenomenal to watch.Overall, a great watch, I personally enjoy every second of the film, I will say it was not what I expected but in a good way I really enjoyed more than I ever imagined. I'm surprised this film only has a 6.3 (at time of writing) on IMDb, I understand this isn't a complete game changer in the genres it covers, however, I feel the low rating is unwarranted.In recent years there has been countless attempts to reboot classic fairy tales into modernised Horror's, Gary Shore on his directorial debut, yes this is his debut film, what a way to kick it off, has done a great job. I was extremely apprehensive and equally excited about the prospect of the reboot, if this film is just the introduction to this world I can not wait to see where it goes. Seriously hope Luke Evans and Charles Dance sign on for further instalments after that ending!",Dracula Untold
143,benntune,Entertainment twist on an old tale,6,18 July 2020,"I enjoyed this movie. Despite its flaws, and there's many, i m drawn to movies about men who will do anything for the protection of their family. One think i didn't understand was why there where Vikings in the close guard of the Ottoman empire. Was this fact or purely made up due to a lack of actors or to merely add a sense of Vikings cruelty to the Ottomans. I don't know the answer to this but it just seemed strange for Scandinavian warriors being used high up in the Turkish military. Granted this is fiction...but it still stood out as something that went a little too far with no regard at all for historical accuracy (if that's what they were aiming for). I still think it's worth a watch.",Dracula Untold
144,InMyHonestOpinion,Dracula reinvented to show he did have a heart,6,26 December 2014,"I've always found the tale of Dracula and who he was an interesting tale, unlike most people though I am well aware that Vlad the Impale was a real man who lived and died in the 1400's and Dracula was a monster created by Bram Stoker in the late 1800's. Most of us most likely had that vision of who Dracula is or was, the pale, thin, strong as 100 men, who can turn into a bat and sleeps in a coffin guy who sucks the blood from virgins and commands the dead army. Dracula untold mixes both the real life of Vlad the Impaler and Bram Stokers Dracula into one. The film starts off with a voice over of a young boy who we soon learn is Prince Vlad's son. Prince Vlad Teres III a Transylvanian ruler learns that the Sultan of the Turks demands he give him 1000 boys to train as warriors for his takeover of Europe, add to the 1000 boys Vlad's own son Ingeras. Vlad as it turns out was given up by his own father years earlier and trained to be a killer where he earned the name Vlad the Impaler due to his act of Impaling his victims giving Prince Vlad the name and face of a monster that most men feared. Not wanting his son to go through the same torture he faced when it comes time for Vlad to hand over his son to the Sultans men he attack and kills them instead and in doing so knows he has dammed his family and his people. He turns to the demon hiding in the caves who he learnt has a power to give in exchange for certain things. The demon will give Vlad superhuman powers that will last 3 days to defeat the Sultans army and save his people, his only downfall though is the insatiable need for human blood, if he can abstain from drinking he will return to his old self if not he is doomed to forever hunt for the blood of others in darkness of the night while the original Vampire can finally escape his prison where he has been condemned to live and feed for 100's of years. The CGI was very impressive in parts, the film was dark for obvious reasons but not horror, not scary, not blood filled as I wanted anyway. It was actually quite tame compared to what I wanted. The camera work was so annoying you hardly got to see any of the actual action apart from a blur and dismembered body part or flung victim. I hate how directors continue to use that kind of action scene, I find it cheap and very un-entertaining. Prince Vlad I thought was played quite well by Luke Evans (Clash of the Titans, The Hobbit) and I look forward to his reinvention of Eric Draven once it's released. Sarah Gadon (Spiderman II) plays Mirena his wife and Art Parkinson (Game of Thrones) plays Ingeras his son. Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) is the Master Vampire and Dominic Cooper (Captain America, Need for Speed) as Sultan Mehmed. Dracula untold works for what it is, there is a lot I would like to see changed but even so I don't believe it ever takes itself too seriously. Apparently they are working on a sequel as part of the Universal monster release (their answer to Marvel and the DC franchise of films being released). Perhaps that's why it seemed like a lost superhero film in parts. Universal is bringing back all the true Monsters in film so watch this space for the next installment of Monster buzz. Dracula Untold ends just when it gathers steam it's quite a short film and not one for the kids.",Dracula Untold
145,jan-hranac,Quite a good film,10,4 February 2015,"The film itself can be rated as passable. There were a few logical glitches for the sake of the plot, mainly Vlad's shortcomings when it comes to time and resource management (seriously, I wouldn't promote him if I was his boss in a company) but that's neither here nor there. However, the most important thing about this film is somewhere else. Similarly to pieces like ""Planet of the apes 2"" and such, ""Dracula Untold"" sends a very important message - one that each and every one of you need to heed, if you want your loved ones to live. Alas, I can't write here what that message is because that would be politically incorrect and this review would be deleted. The ending was promising though it could survive having a certain element in it (I can't write what kind of element because this is a non-spoiler review).",Dracula Untold
146,thedukeofmovietown,A different kind of Batman,6,31 October 2016,"I saw Dracula UNTOLD this weekend! This is movie marks Universal Studio's first film in a series of films that will seek to reboot it's long neglected monster movie franchise which is said to include movies about the mummy, the wolf man, Frankenstein, the invisible man and others. It tells an alternate version of the popular Bram Stroker Dracula story that centers around the legendary warrior Vlad the Impaler, his family and his quest to protect his kingdom from the fury of an invading Turk army.Let me start off by saying that I liked this movie. Luke Evans plays the title role with Dominic Cooper playing his nemesis Emperor Mehmed II and the two each do a great job of playing their respective roles with Evans especially standing out, as you would expect, as a man hell bent on keeping his people safe and secure. Charles Dance is also very good here as the creature who turns Vlad into the famous monster. The action and the fight scenes with Evans as Dracula are also quite impressive. This movie is not all aces though, it's mechanics are sound but the story feels a little thin and it's final scenes seem somewhat tacked together from scenes from 30 Days of Night which is not bad but it's... you know... Anyway, despite that, I did like it quite a bit and it's worth checking out. Maybe not right away, but it's enjoyable. Dracula Untold gets a 3... out of 5.",Dracula Untold
147,SofiCastle,Fun film,7,28 February 2019,"This is an entertaining film that got a lot of negative reviews here because it vaguely argues that it was no fun living under the Ottoman Turks. Surely, the film does not aspire to be a true biography of Vlad Tepes, there are many anachronisms, the accents are funny, the costumes seem off, but the Turks did collect young boys from all over the empire, they did kidnap young girls for their harems and they actually were extremely hard on the Christians. On the other hand, VAMPIRES DO NOT EXIST. It is thus ridiculous for someone who is ready to watch a film on non existent bat-like blood-drinking fiends to argue that said film is crap on account of how Sultan Mehmet was in fact ten years old at the time this story is supposed to take place.",Dracula Untold
148,mr_iceman,"A good attempt, however too issues",4,30 November 2014,"I don't usually like to point our factual errors and plot holes in fantasy movies as they're made to entertain you in their own right.However these coupled with terrible acting and a shoddy script force you to cast a vote below 5 The first 15mins starts out fine until you're introduced to the Turkish King, Mehmed (played by Dominic Cooper) the haircut sticks out like dogs balls. Looking at history books all over, I fail to see a King at the time with a 'Backstreet Boys' haircut. A shaved side with neatly gelled hair, combed. Whether you like it or not, your brain cannot take him seriously as a king, hence all further attempts are but futile.The acting was mediocre at best, other than Vlad (Luke) and Mirena (Sarah) the rest of the clan barely broke out any facial expressions resembling their given plight. I should have expected that given most of the actors/actresses have a major amount of ""TV"" appearances on their IMDb profile. I was rarely engaged throughout the film to a point where I got up to check the patch update status of my PC game.One of the most central items of the film, the Master Vampire had barely any background, most of his history was self-spoken by him and you had to join the dots yourself to understand his situation.These combined with various other issues which I will not disclose here (due to spoilers) were enough to score this a 4/10",Dracula Untold
149,kangarooconnor,If longer and more we'll thought out it would have been perfect.,7,2 May 2019,"This movie is pretty good in my opinion, stays with the concept and themes of Dracula and takes on a new meaning and ideas. Yes it's not as good as it could have been it's quite short, the villain is kind of just an early 50s comic book bad guy and the love relationship between Dracula and his wife is kinda bad and not enjoyable, but the action especially in the end is pretty good the reasoning for the movie is as stated reasonable protect his son by stopping him from becoming like him.Overall it was a movie that you can enjoy and not take to hard with good acting and good fights

150,smashthecontrolmachine,Vlad the incredible :),10,15 October 2014,"Just saw this in Imax and I was surprisingly impressed. I am a pretty tough critic of vampire movies and very few of then get it right. I am a fan of how the story here is told and of the special effects as well. I feel the entire movie was of very high entertainment value. No matter how much you know about Vlads story this movie brings something fresh and compelling to the legend. I appreciated the character development here as well, the characters we needed to care about most, we feel closely enough to, to really care what happens to them. Luke Evans is a great Vlad, really he steals the movie but I also loved Dominic Cooper as Mehmed. I highly recommend this!",Dracula Untold

152,jeffreyhillen-364-945381,Luke Evans as Vlad Dracula,5,15 October 2014,"Dracula Untold tells the classic story of Vlad during the battle with the Turkish. Comparing to other Dracula films this one takes place earlier in the Dracula time line and focuses much more on the battle between the Turkish and him. But also it is more focused on how he became a vampire. If you have seen a couple of Dracula films or know the story than you expect some things that will certainly happen.Luke Evans had a very hard job on performing such an iconic character. He plays a characters which was done so many times by very great actors as Gary Oldman and Christopher Lee. Yet you can see that he approached the role on his own way. He plays a vulnerable man ; he cares about his family and only wants peace. but he also plays the character with a madness once he's the monster and as the Impaler. He performed this role really well the audience felt the pain that Vlad had to carry. Luke Evans did a wonderful job playing him.Sometimes I think the Special Effects were not very great. The look of the Vampire in the cave was so bad. It was like I saw someone doing a parody of Lord Voldemort. They could have done a better job on that, a better cross between human and the monster he is. But the fight scenes were filmed really great which was really interesting to watch.There were too things that weren't necessary to include in the film. That was one; he is The Impaler but I wanted to see that filmed scarier. You really have to be afraid for what Dracula is capable of. It was too easy, like it was just this habit of him. I wanted to see more time on that part when he does that. And the thing I hated was that he lived in the future. Why showing that ? That wasn't the point of the film at all. It wasn't necessary, I preferred that cut out.Seeing all these point together I'd give this film 5/10 it wasn't extremely bad but also not extremely good. Luke Evans did an all-right performance and the story was nice to see in a film again, told in a different way, that's why 5 out of 10. Gary Oldman will for me always be the best Dracula.",Dracula Untold
153,jmazznyc,Luke Evans,10,6 October 2018,"The naysayers of this flick just don't wanna have fun. The visuals/special effects are great; the story engaging. A fresh 21st century take on a classic. Would have really given it 8 stars, but as a gay man being able to watch Luke Evans for an hour and a half makes it a 10! :)",Dracula Untold
154,kane_1371-117-231060,Why the hate? this movie is cool!,7,10 February 2015,"It seems that 2 kind of people hate this movie. The Turks since they think they are being demonized and the History buffs and Original Dracula buffs.First of, the Turks are represented pretty much fairly in this movie. They are the leaders of the area, they have control over these lands, demand revenge for their destroyed battalion of scouts, are arrogant but it is given since they are the super power here. Mehmed is inspiring, leading his army into battle but he is also a bitch and doesn't want to talk reason since he is blinded by revenge. I don't see any mistreatment of turks. They are not portrayed as savages, they are portrayed as arrogant conquerers which is actually a fair portrayal.Then we have the History buffs, it is understandable that you would get a bit annoyed about mistakes like names or sceneries but if you are so annoyed and bitter over these small things that it ruins your experience than you have a big problem and should try to relax more and enjoy life more. This is a fictional movie with a tiny hint at facts. There wasn't really a vampire, it is just a fictional story with its roots shrouded in long gone real facts, why would anyone care about historical accuracy if the story is not deliberately sabotaging the historical facts, it is just a fictional story to entertain, I mean this is not 300, a movies heavily relying of historical events filled with false accusations and events. This is a Dracula movie!For the Dracula fans, I understand you want the old Dracula and don't like this new telling of the story but that is done to many times, this is a new telling and a new story.The movie itself has some highs and some lows.I would say this there are some shoddy stuff like Dracula's wife being able to stay alive after a huge fall long enough to ask him to drink her blood.But then there are some highlights of awesome battle scenes with neat cgi. The choice of Charles Dance as the role of first vampire is intriguing, he is one great actor and can do a lot with this role in the future.Luke Evans was a good choice, he did sell the character well.There are some stuff in the script like Dracula ordering the clouds to clear up and leading to death of all the other vampires. Him not destroying Mehmed's army during the night time instead of waiting for them to get to the gates. Deciding to have the sequel in the present time is also too boring, we have seen enough vampire movies from blade to underworld to twilight to Vanhellsing that included guns or similar stuff. The idea of the original vampire challenging the Satan himself is much more appealing in a medieval setting than in the present day life. All in all this movie is getting undeserved heat, it is a nice cool movie with potential for growth in the future.",Dracula Untold
155,Royalcourtier,Effective retelling,8,5 October 2014,"Normally vampire films portray the vampire as either a monstrous villain (usually) or as a (relatively) innocent character (rarely). This film gives a more nuanced interpretation, which was quite effective. In order to protect his family and kingdom (actually principality), Vlad is prepared to run almost any risk. One which ultimately ends badly for him.There were a few bizarre errors of plot - for instance why would the Sultan send 100,000 men after a handful of stragglers in the mountains of a remote part of the empire. And how could they get there in only one or two days? Did the Porte have teleporters? And how was an apparently impregnable monastery entered so easily.The Sultan's army had only a minor role. They were just there to be killed with convincing completeness.When Vlad and his people were lamenting the invasion of the Turk, and Vlad was willing to try anything to defeat them, I could not help thinking of Washington. Just like Vlad, the Pentagon is willing to make a pack with the Devil to defeat the Taliban/ISIS/Al Qaeda/Turk. A very contemporary film, in some ways.Well acted, as befits a British-made film.All in all, a good film, but one not without its flaws.",Dracula Untold
156,JoeC345,Good Monster Movie Fun,7,25 January 2015,"I would like to start by saying that I understand the critical reviews of this movie, I really do. There are many flaws in this movie and some of the performances, with the exception of the superb Charles Dance as the master vampire, are lacking.However, in spite of it's flaws ""Dracula Untold"" is a entertaining movie from start to finish. This is the sort of film that critics try to take too seriously and focus too strongly on it's flaws and historical inaccuracies. For instance Mehmet never personally led an attack against his brother even though they were foes for many years. Here's my retort to that, WHO CARES! this is a story about Dracula, not the actual Vlad Tepes. Ironically my favorite depiction of Vlad comes from the ""DaVinci's Demons"" episode ""The Devil"".The story of Dracula is an old one, but this film does credit to it's predecessors by introducing a plausible back story along with some bloody good battles and impalement's.If your looking for a good monster story with some pretty sweet effects ""Dracula Untold"" is a solid choice.",Dracula Untold
157,Necroambulant,Not Bad At All,7,12 May 2015,"A Dracula origin story was never something that needed to be made...not by even the wildest stretch of the imagination. That said, Dracula Untold (ignoring what is arguably one of the single most insipid titles that could have been chosen) wasn't altogether a bad movie. It isn't a masterpiece and it won't be the sort of movie that will be cherished decades from now as a great piece of movie history (unless the events of Idiocracy come to pass)...but it was a solid bit of filmmaking. Had different actors been cast in a couple of the roles it would have been the sort of movie worth little more than a laugh and some well-deserved derision. The special effects weren't bad either, though I have seen better. I don't recommend rushing out to pick up a copy or anything, but if you get the chance, it is worth taking the time to sit through it and enjoy it for what it is...a monster movie made in the tradition of the old Universal monster movies, and as such it was a suitable homage.",Dracula Untold
158,Rocketeer_Raccoon,"Watchable but sucked, & I don't mean like a Vampire",5,24 October 2015,"First of all I want to clear up that there's nothing historically accurate in this film, instead it's a fictional twisted story of how Vlad Tepes became the legendary Vampire, Dracula which is an idea that's been done before in Dracula (1992) but in this story he became a Vampire solely to protect his family and kingdom from the invading Turks. The movie is OK, it's watchable but there's things in this movie that really bug me somewhat.Generally Vampires have a weakness to heart impalement, sunlight and crosses, however they decided to include silver as a weakness, seriously this should be the weakness for Werewolves, not Vampires. Come to think of it Dracula in Bram Stoker's classic story didn't have a weakness to sunlight. Also Vlad Tepes's Dracula name in the correct sense means ""Son of the Dragon"", not ""Son of the Devil""... Where on Earth did this idea come from?The action was alright but if you ask me this is pretty much a mediocre film in my opinion.",Dracula Untold
159,tags_skeewee,Great take on a Dracula,10,26 November 2014,I agree with other reviews. People this is a fantasy people. It was not boring. It was fun and interesting take on the Dracula story. So what liberty with the actual history. So what. I'm only sad the movie was too short. It had the right amount of action. It did not need lots of gore. The scenes were well played. The darkness of the movie helped with the atmosphere. The actor they choose to play Dracula was perfect. His dark and passionate acting really brought the chapter to life. The beauty of story telling is you can change it how you want. Giving Dracula a heart. It made you root for him. There are a few cheesy lines. This does not mean the entire movie was bad. Great pacing. Good special effects. Great movie.,Dracula Untold
160,cesbanbelubo21,Bad,4,29 December 2020,Movie very bad. This Dracula's actor is the worst dracula ever,Dracula Untold
161,rajivness,...meh! I'd skip this one,5,12 October 2014,"OK so this is YET another Dracula movie (Yawwnn!) - which is supposed to be like an X-men origins type movie. OK, so the movie is loosely based on the historical account of Vlad Dracul - depicted well in the 2000 Movie The Dark Prince: The True Story of Dracula - which was nice to see.The movie talked about how Romania was threatened by the Turkish Empire. This is historically accurate. The movie talks about how the Turkish Sultan would take 100s of young boys as Tribute and make them learn the Turk Way and Fight for the Turks. This is true also. This is also similar to the Story of Arthur. Check out the 2004 movie - King Arthur - starring Clive Owen - which is another gem i.e. a movie based on actual historical account of the man behind the legend. Anyways, I digress...Back to Dracula Untold. So the Prince is really committed to protecting his Kingdom - at ANY cost - which basically leads him to the supernatural and you can guess the rest.The movie has nice FX, a decent cast - but a pretty flimsy story. They didn't do anything different or explore new angles or even try and reinvent this iconic character. It would have been cool - if the Director did something like DC Comics Elseworlds - where they reinvented the Dracula Story - but in a completely different setting - like India or Africa or China. That, would have been fun!This movie played it too safe and is just Another Dracula movie (yawn x2) and introduces some silly powers that make Dracula look very comic book superhero like - kinda like Xmen Storm and DC's Animal Man - which didn't really help the authenticity the director was trying to establish. I won't share too much coz I'd want you to check this movie out on DVD or whatever and then decide if I was right or way off. So, net net, i'd give this a 5/10 coz it wasn't horrible to watch - but my expectations were not met at all! Definitely checkout the two movies I cited in my review though. Those were Awesome!",Dracula Untold
162,AkelaLoneWolf,Disappointing Dracula,5,29 October 2014,"To confess, I was not as enthusiastic as my friend in anticipation of this film though we both have a penchant for vampires. It appeared that the story was already clearly outlined in the trailer. Nevertheless, I hoped it would be good entertainment. Unfortunately, the viewing only proved my initial suspicion true. The plot was paper-thin, the character development non-existent and the ending ambiguous and weak. Numerous unexplained points were left hanging in the air (the excuse of these being the basis of a sequel doesn't work unless people really want to watch another movie like this), and this left the audience perplexed and unsatisfied. The director should have delved into the human-monster struggle and make that the focus of the film. Now the pain and suffering of Vlad was only lightly touched upon and the description of his resistance was superficial. Lacking dramatic force and tension, the subsequent narrative of this supposedly tragic hero became strained and stretched. It was not within even shouting distance of its epic counterparts. Come to speak of it, the circumstances that drove the main protagonist to seek help from supernatural powers were weak in the first place. And for the sake of argument, why would the master vampire even bother to impart the secret of the undead to Vlad at all? If he were that eager to break his curse he should be turning every intruder instead of devouring them. To conclude, this barely qualifies as no-brain entertainment if one is besotted and mesmerized by Luke Evans. Otherwise, forget it.",Dracula Untold

This is by far the best Dracula movie ever, let alone one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. Here are some of the best features: (1) A strong, patriotic leader (who happens to be Dracula) refuses to submit to a bloodthirsty tyrant, (2) The same leader puts protecting his wife, his family and his people before all else, (3) Heterosexual marriage and family are depicted favorably (sorry, same-sex lunatics will be disappointed) (4) Christianity is depicted favorably, instead of being trashed, (5) Islam is depicted as a bloodthirsty scourge - that would be the Turks in this movie, (6) The action is intense and non-stop, (7) The special effects are terrific, (8) The lead character (Dracula) is a complex mixture of sin and virtue; he makes admirable choices under the circumstances; this is not the blood-drinking, one-dimensional, bodice-ripping monster of all the other Dracula movies; you actually end up rooting for Dracula in this movie, and he prevails! Yes, I realize this movie is NOT true to history. It's historical fiction. Deal with it and ENJOY!",Dracula Untold

166,lmahesa,Epic!,9,8 November 2014,"This movie is so historically inaccurate. They got everything wrong, from the number of stakes used to the fang lengths...... oh, wait. This is called Dracula Untold. Not Vlad Untold. Let's start again, shall we?If you're like me and enjoy origin stories for villains, monsters and various psychos in slasher flicks, you would have noticed by now that there is a gaping hole where Dracula, the king of villains, is concerned. The 1992 movie starring Gary Oldman took some steps to remedy that situation, but that was a mere segment of a more traditional Dracula movie.This film remedies that situation, and in spades. It takes what you liked about the 1992 movie and multiplies it. It is a blend of history and fantasy, with a good cast. The clothing, weapons, scenery, makeup, effects... all were done well and not to excess. In fact, there was very little gore.

Absolutely ridiculous and a real shame because it had so much potential. The basic idea was thrilling, the special effects were very cool, the costumes and sets were top notch. The acting and casting were fine. But the writer and director and anyone else with a say in this disaster have no concept of time. None. Their time frames within the movie are absurd to the point of being silly. This goes well beyond not being able to 'suspend disbelief'.

And a hundred times more likable than Twilight Saga, for sure. I call this a vampyr movie.If you care for research based and historically correct stories, I'd say: stick to the BBC. I thought people got used to wrong terms and conditions in motion pictures? Take a look at known series like ""Grimm"". They try to tell their audience, in Vienna they speak French. LOL!

170,victuki,"Dracula, Lord of The Bats",6,27 October 2014,"I have always been a fan of vampires, in literature, cinema and any other media. Every time I hear about a Dracula project, I get excited and suspicious at the same time. It tends to happen when dealing with such a cultural icon. Luke Evans (Please, make him the next Bond) was a perfect choice for the part, and I was so excited about it. However, when I first watched the trailer I must confess my spider-sense was tingling. It was too much a video-clip style, and I was wary about it, but not wrong. Let's recapitulate: Vlad Tepes, the impaler, Prince of Wallachia, is the ruler of the nation, respected by allies and foes, but when Sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper, Daddy Stark in the Marvel Universe) requests a thousand boys for his army, Vlad refuses. The chaos unleashed by his actions will bring death, and he searches power in a dark cave that turns out to be the very hell. The realm of an evil creature (The great Charles Dance, daddy Lannister) that gives Vlad a dark gift, but such powers.. Are they a curse or a blessing? As I said before, this is but a humble opinion, the look of the movie is a video-clip like photography, and not a great one. Being a dark story, it tends to happen at night, but what it might look a creepy setting, looks just dark, in a negative way, crappy quality and action scenes are full of high speed camera movements, what I call the ""Greengrass Effect"" (Watch ""The Bourne Supremacy, 2004) and you will get it.It seems to me they had a good story but could not nail it. Plain and simple, not the outcome you would expect from such a big budget production, not to speak about the icon it represents. They got a blockbuster, nothing more, and it's a shame. I'll stick to my favorite, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (Francis Ford Coppola, 1992). Bottom line, fangs down!",Dracula Untold
171,Drive-in_Zeppelin,Whoever thought this was a good idea must be absolutely batty!,4,12 October 2014,"I would try my best not to write a scathing review, but this movie was simply awful. There is absolutely nothing redeemable about it save for a few CGI moments and eye-candy if you love bats. There's a lot of them. The story, if it can so be called, is basically that Vlad the Impaler was a political prisoner of the neighboring Turks when he was a child. He was conditioned to be a soldier in their vast empire and to fight in their wars. Eventually he went back home and restored peace to his kingdom. Then the Turks need more boy-soldiers, including Vlad's son, but are provoked by Vlad to war when he refuses to give them up. Naturally the Sultan just happens to have hundreds of thousands of soldiers nearby and Vlad has to seek out a Vampire in hopes of saving his kingdom. Like I said, the story sounds like it was written by a 12 year old that wants to see Dracula in Dragon armor and surrounded by epic fights and lot of cleavage. There is an extremely small amount of historical basis for the story, and its just 90 minutes or so of painful dialogue and lackluster action sequences. It looks and feels like the movie Van Helsing, only spiced up a bit with 300-style action visuals and Game of Thrones cinematography. In fact, I think that's what the producers were hoping to capitalize on as there are at least 3 Game of Thrones actors cast in Dracula Untold - including Charles Dance. The acting is all around terrible, the vampire lore is just a jumbled mess, and if this indeed was meant as a launching point for a shared universe of classic monsters, the next several years will just be painful. Pay particular attention to the sense of time in this movie as it is quite hysterical. Halfway through the movie the director just gives up and suddenly people magically scale mountains in a matter of seconds. Also prepare to be upset if you happen to know anything about vampire lore, it pretty much all gets thrown out the window. Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website",Dracula Untold
172,nflores342,Dracula Untold,8,13 October 2014,"It's been awhile since i've written a review for a film, but I felt the need to say something about about Dracula Untold. I'm a vampire fan. I have been ever since I watched Interview with Vampire (1994) and Dracula (1992) in 1997. And having seen those wonderful movies, I knew this revision of the legendary vampire was going to get bashed. I know most people said, when the trailer for this film came out, ""aw crap, another vampire flick,"" and you know what, I get it; Twilight ruined vamps for some people.The 2 biggest problems most moviegoers are going to have with this film is that 1. Vlad (Dracula) the main character of the film, is based on Vlad Tepes, know simply as Vlad the Impaler, the legendary warrior who killed his victims and impaled them on spears to strike fear into his enemies. In this film, Vlad is completely revamped (ha ha pun) into a kind, loving, family man who is trying to protect his family and people from war against the Turks.Aside from the difference in character, other historical figures and locations are used in the film and they are far from being historically correct. But, most moviegoers don't have the slightest inclination of the history of the Ottoman empire, let alone of Vlad the impaler, so it shouldn't be a big deal.And 2. Everyone (well most everyone) knows how this story plays out, it's been done numerous times before, so it's hard to be surprised or expect anything new from this version. So if you remove those aspects (the historical ones) and the fact that you know what happens away form the film, what you are left with is a another vampire story that is a fun, action packed, popcorn flick that is decent.So, on to some personal pros and cons! :) Pros:1.The costumes and sets are great. They help set the mood and tone of the story and add to the authenticity of the films time period.2.The acting is good, not Oscar worthy by any means, but good enough to where you don't question the character/actors believability. 3.Like some vampire stories, there is a bit of romance and it is wonderful. The chemistry between Luke and Sarah is one of the best aspects of the film, their love is tender, true, and makes the story what it is.4. For true Dracula fan, the last 5 minutes of the film is brilliant, I was truly fan girling. #sequel.The Con:Yes con, the only problem I had with the film is that there was a lot going on in the film, and when this happens plot holes are created. From Vlad trying to keep his son and people safe, to negotiating with the Sultan, to finding the ""strength"" (vampiric powers) to defeat the Turks and to fight his urge to drink blood, it was a bit much. It wasn't cohesive, with so much going on, of course plot holes are bound to happen. 2 scenes in particular made me pause and question the film. The first was that the Master Vampire is cursed and confined to the cave he is first discovered in, that is literally written in the legend and the book from where the legend is first told, so why is it that when Vlad finally succumbs to the curse that he is able to exist outside of the cave? That is never explained and is a major plot hole. The second was towards the end of the film and is when the Priest of Vlad's castle reveals what he has become to his people by revealing him in the sunlight and he starts to burn. His people turn on him and try to destroy him. This scene was completely unnecessary and a waste of time. Why would his people, who fear him at this point try to kill him and then still choose to fight for him? Totally pointless and didn't make any sense. Instead the director should've scrapped these scenes and elaborated on the key points of the story to make it better and stronger.With that i'll say this. Enjoy the film for what it is, a revamped (ha ha, a pun) vampire story with a wonderful love story and great action made to be an enjoyable popcorn movie experience that is made to take your mind away from your everyday lives. Don't read into it, just let your fangs hand free. :)",Dracula Untold
173,isabelle-frater,The scenes look beautiful,5,30 October 2014,"The ratings on this one are pretty bad, but I thought it looked good, so I wanted to see for myself what this movie was like. I'm kind of on the fence about it, because it wasn't that bad, not even boring.The story was very predictable, though the precise way of how Vlad became Dracula was something that I haven't seen before. Even though I knew what was going to happen, I wanted to see it. What actually did impress me about the movie was precisely that, the imagery. The colours, or rather the lack of them was great. In the beginning you still have some warm tones, the grass is green, the candle gives a warm yellow light. By the end, everything is grey and muted, just the red of the armour stands out. Among all the darkness the one bright spot is Mirena, the wife. Her beauty is so great, I often just stared at her on the screen, not being able to take my eyes off. Her white dress towards the end with the red lining displays her innocence, and how she is the one pure thing in all the darkness. Her purity comes out of the love of her two men. What I would really like to do is get the movie and make screenshots.Luke Evans made a pretty good Dracula. They probably had him sunbathing, because his skin was as dark as usually the people in the region are. His eyes were intense and telling. Sarah Gadon made an achingly beautiful Mirena. Frankly, I was quite mesmerised by her. She did feel familiar and I have seen her in a few things, but here they managed to make her very memorable. I also enjoyed Dominic Cooper as Mehmed. He actually looked Turkish.Overall, I don't think it was a very bad movie. It wasn't so horrible that I'm going to have nightmares. In a way I found it intriguing in the artistic way it was handled. It's not a big movie, but the story was quite enjoyable, and the action, while at times a bit ridiculous, fun. It had a definite dark feel. Watchable.",Dracula Untold
174,sastorytellerfilms,What Batman should have been and complete awesomeness,10,11 November 2014,"I gave this movie 10 stars because you can't deny the pure epicness of this film. The cinematography and flow of the film just work. The idea behind Dracula in this is the most original idea to come along in a great while. This is what Batman should have been. An unstoppable force of darkness that can conquer entire armies single handedly. I actually cheered watching this movie and I did not expect much at all honestly. What Dracula Untold is an ingenious blend of Braveheart, Batman Begins, and Underworld. It delivers an easy to understand story and doesn't try to get too complicated proving something historically. The heroism in this movie is on a level with Lord of the Rings. One man with incredible powers from dark forces using those forces to protect the ones he loves. See it for yourself without comparing it to history or another movie. It stands on it's own perfectly. ~ S A Storyteller",Dracula Untold

I mean it takes time to impale several thousand humans on stakes and then to make sure they stay upright... that is quite a task and I would like to see it explained.

177,theflixerdotcom,"Lots of fun, but don't expect your father's Dracula movie..",6,9 November 2014,"Believe it or not, this was a movie I was looking forward to watching. I enjoyed Luke Evans in the Hobbit and had high hopes here. Don't get me wrong, I fully understood the differences between this and a traditional Dracula movie. I was just curious to see if it was going to work...I was a little late to the game, and I could see this movie hadn't got much love, so I had the expectation going in that I was going to be disappointed. Honestly, I wasn't. This movie delivered on it's promise of an action/fantasy movie rather than a horror origin story. It had horror elements, but it was fairly toned down to reach a broader audience. That was probably the main gripe I had with it. I think a Dracula movie geared towards teens is probably never going to be a good idea. Dracula is supposed to be ruthless, brutal, and evil incarnate.. That said, he could be heroic in his early origin, but I think he would still have to be ruthless and brutal and I didn't have that feeling here. He was too much of a good guy for me. Even the way he killed the baddies was kind of watered down on the brutality side (not saying it wasn't interesting, it was more Hobbit than Dracula though) With that out of the way, I enjoyed the performances from Evans and Dominic Cooper as Mehmed. I really liked the effects; particularly the epic battle sequences which did a good job of showing the power that Dracula possess. The story was a little vanilla other than the back story to where the powers come from.In the end, this movie was a decent action/fantasy flick but it was certainly not the Dracula movie I would have liked to see. Turn up the Dracula and turn down the audience concerns. One last note -- I hated the 'extended' ending...please don't make that sequel.",Dracula Untold

See the market place where the monk confronts Vlad aka Dracul... son of dragon & devil... and some other Vlad.Speaking of similarities, the movie also visited Batman series briefly. If he compels hard enough, he'll turn into Batman cgi and kick the entire army's ass. What a bonus...After that, here comes the Matrix. Definitely that two battle scenes are rip off from Matrix 3's UFC scenes.Racing through the uncomfortable situations to catch your beloved one... from the first spider man i guess? or maybe superman lives...For the final, they thought it's good to place a final showdown at the CAVE of DUCK TALES!!! this time, instead of swimming in coins, they have to kill each other, throw that coin and burn him.Wait.

179,un1,Meh,4,29 October 2014,"I don't mind that much that the movie has little to do with history(Vlad wasn't a vampire, he was born in Transylvania but he ruled Wallachia, he fought the Turks for more than 3 days, the Sultan never died etc.) but this movie doesn't have much logic to it: he turns against the Turks on a whim(because, apparently, his wife would rather see a war with the Ottoman empire, than her son be taken hostage) then thinking he can't win, without even trying, he instantly tries to cheat his way out by going to the vampire(not knowing if he will insta-kill him or not, like it almost happened the last time), without making any defense preparations in his leave. During this time, the Turks magically summon an army and are already attacking Vlad's Castle, although the border distance from Transylvania and the Ottoman Empire, at that time, was over 200km(that would make Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian, the architects of Blitzkrieg via Armored Warfare, jelly), not to mention that the Turks would have to attack fortified mountain passes to even get into Transylvania...and that neither Transylvania or Wallachia payed tribute to the Ottoman empire at that time. It would make me think the Turks have supernatural powers that include premonition and super-fast travel speed, which they make use again to send an army over the border and catch up with the Transylvanians(moving away to another castle where ""they would be safer"") although they take precautions and move fast, in less than 1 day(my guess is that the Turks were using hax). Anyway, Vlad catches up to this 2nd Turkish army and destroys it, then the next day the Turks again pull a Flash and start attacking the castle, but this time they make use of another hax, they went through the castle walls as Vlad was busy killing their 3rd army, get to Vlad's wife and push her over into a massive fall from the castle, Vlad tries to help, fails, and the wife, instead of thanking Vlad for the sacrifices he made and realizing how stupid she was, she again asks Vlad to do something stupid, and drink her blood(to permanently become a vampire), which he does... the end disappoints me the most, it took 600 years for the Master Vampire to call for Vlad's aid, but, although the movie makes it undeniable that it uses the Christian dogma, and that there is heaven and hell, demons and vampires, apparently Buddhism is also there, as Vlad's wife magically reincarnates... facepalm material. The story is poorly written, it always feels that a lot of the plot elements are missing, I'm thinking they cut a lot of scenes out, which would have made it a more decent movie, but because that it has nothing to do with history(even less than Bram Stoker's Book), Bram Stoker's Book(at least it's a story about a Vampire named Dracula, which relates the two), logic and that the characters themselves seemed to be plagued by emotions and stupidity, I can't rate this higher than 4 out of 10.

IMHO no 'Dracula' movie has ever come close to Bram Stoker's book although Dracula (1992) was a fine attempt. I'm happy say that as a 'where did it all start' movie, this story is miles better than the disastrous and incomprehensible 'I Frankenstein'. Others here have addressed the main issues so I won't cover old ground but suffice to say that Luke Evans and Sarah Gadon were a great choice, but Domonic Cooper, as much as I have liked him in other roles was terribly miscast here. There was room for far more character and story development but wasn't to be. Most disappointingly, I found Charles Dance very unconvincing as the original vampire but made perfect sense as sinister 'English gent' at the end...maybe I'm just typecasting him?

182,john-connor-freedomfight,Perfection,10,8 November 2014,"The story told here is the first time the real pagan religion surrounding Vlad the Impaler has been told in Hollywood. As opposed to the other critics here I will go deep into the origins of the story of the Vampire. One thing is for sure, none of them were heroes but nephilim who ate human flesh and drank blood. We find traces of them in Genesis 6. There oftentimes the nephilim who are trans genetic beings, offspring of the Bnei Elohim, are called Giants. The Bnei Elohim in turn oftentimes translated son of YHWH who fell for the beauty of human women and begot children with them, in Hebrew the nephilm. The Torah says: There were nephilim in the land in those days and also after (the flood). Later on in the Torah and Tanakh we meet them again, i.e. the inhabitants of Israel, the ""people"" Joshua and the Israelites slew, the six fingered giant Goliath who David slew as well as the amorites, a nation of nephilim who David and his men exterminated completely. Now in Talmudic literature as well as in the apocrypha we can learn more about them, learn more about their blood thirst and human flesh eating habits, how they as Genesis 6 puts it ""corrupted all flesh"" by creating all kinds of trans genetic beings including human/angelic and animal hybrids that threatened and nearly wiped out the human race completely. Had not YHWH saved Noah and his family by sending the Flood to wipe the slate clean and thereby saved His Creation, all life on earth would have been extinct.Had there not been archaeological evidence of their existence and their achievements, the monolithic structures that bear witness of them all over the world, most notably the Pyramids we could have laughed it all off and called it fairy tales. But for those who dare to look for the evidence, the evidence is too compelling and comprehensive to shrug of as mere fiction. In addition, we find these stories all over the globe in all cultures even those who were completely disconnected from each other. Some say they are back, now calling themselves aliens, again doing trans genetic experiments to reproduce using human and animal DNA.One thing is for sure, there is a lot between the heavens and the earth that we don't fully know. As Moses wrote: There were indeed nephilim in those days and also after...As for the movie, perfection in its genre, I'll have to give it a 10/10.",Dracula Untold

This time we get to see his origins as Vlad III 'The Impaler' Tepes, a 15th century Transylvanian prince famed for skewering his enemies on big sticks. So much for Gothic romance. Essentially an elaboration on the artful prologue to Francis Ford Coppola's lavish 1992 adaptation of the classic novel, we get to see Prince Vlad deliver bloody diplomacy to the Ottoman Empire after he refuses their army's demands for one thousand of his male subjects including his own son. In a desperate effort to overcome his adversaries, Vlad enters into a Faustian pact with a pasty- faced, cave-dwelling sorcerer (Dance) who grants him preternatural powers. Among recent attempts to reanimate the corpse of Bram Stoker's most famous creation, there was Italian horror maestro Dario Argento's Dracula 3D (2012), which bafflingly saw the count transmogrify into a praying mantis. Elsewhere the vampire granddaddy found his home on television, featuring in Showtime's brilliantly revisionist Penny Dreadful and most notably in NBC's Dracula (2013), for which he's reimagined as a Victorian-era advocate for clean energy in a smog-filled London. This cancelled series showed promise but suffered from a mixed bag of a cast, led by Jonathan Rhys Meyers who lacked presence as the titular monster. In contrast, Dracula Untold also has its flaws, but its lead is not one of them. Luke Evans, a Welshman, does his damnedest to imbue a weak, overly expositional script with his full-blooded, emotionally-charged performance. Some scenes between Vlad and his young son (Game of Thrones alumni Art Parkinson) are genuinely touching, while the same cannot be said for those shared by Vlad and his beloved wife, Merina. Sarah Gadon is a poor foil for Evans, giving a flat, sap-filled, puppy-eyed performance that fails to measure up. This shifts the emotional core of the film towards father and son, which functions well enough, but pushes a tacked-on epilogue, set in the present day, further toward redundancy. Despite an altogether different scale and budget, all the British accents contribute a distinctly 1970s Hammer Horror flavour to the proceedings, which is not at all unwelcome. Detractors will rightly point out that the film works neither as historical document nor as an out and out horror, but it does partially succeed as historical fantasy – a fictionalised biographical picture about a legendary folk hero in much the same vein as Robin Hood. This is in keeping with Vlad Tepes' pre-Stoker status in parts of eastern Europe, where he is remembered as a fearless warrior prince who rose to defend his kingdom against the onslaught of the Ottoman Empire. It's unlikely that Dracula Untold will, as Universal apparently intended, kickstart a revival of their classic monster series – modelled after Marvel Comics' incredibly successful superhero films – due to the poor reception of this film. This marks the studio's second attempt, following the failure of its (not reprehensible) 2010 production, The Wolfman. Nevertheless, taken as a stand-alone entry in an over-crowded genre, Dracula Untold just about holds its own as a new take on an oft told tale – unwittingly falling into B-movie territory, but with charm enough to be enjoyed as a guilty pleasure.",Dracula Untold
189,nm4701284,My kind of movie,10,15 June 2015,"This movie had it all: history, love, fiction, legend, mystery, thirst, a good cast, great lead actor, powerful delivery, great story telling and emotional charge at several points in the film that would not let you relax, but get you involve in the story, great execution from costumes and make up to the CGI bats and the use of them.I don't know what I can say more. It's just so good. Yes, it had small imperfections like any other things man made, but it left a mark on me and you know, the movies that you're still talking about after several months you watched it, are good.This is my kind of movie!",Dracula Untold
190,Diedelmon,It should've known and done better.,2,16 November 2014,"This movie had everything. Great photography, good direction, good costume design (though I think someone forgot it was 1442 and threw in some 1900's boots and jackets, but we can ignore that when it's dark), great acting... The dance between Luke Evans and Charles Dance is superb, to say the least (and look, never a Lannister has stood so close to a Stark without a good killing). The soundtrack is very powerful. It had everything going on... But the story. What is it with this ""let's make classical villains good fellas"" trend? Dracula is a myth. A very good one, by the way. It is not to be meddled with. He is the Prince of Darkness, ruler of all vampires, the oldest of the fallen ones and he is purely and deliciously evil. They should've kept it that way, instead of this ""I'm doing this bad thing for the greater good, but it will be OK, I'll end it myself"". I think this is all Twilight's fault. This stupid saga went about destroying all that was enticing about these creatures - their sense of survival, their ruthlessness, their brutal rationality about life, their passion, their consuming rage, their incredible powers of seduction... It's all going down the drain. Out with the real thing, let's only make Disney vampires now, is it?",Dracula Untold

They all take some liberty at telling a story from different perspectives. Whether you require the boring repetitiveness of the same, same story, countlessly told over and over again, that's your prerogative. But for those of us who enjoy a good story and are not bound by doctrine, we can appreciate the creation of a different vantage this film presents. It is a film which speaks of the honor of an individual who scarifies his very own life for the sake of others; about honor and values. Personally, I found the script, production, direction and cast superbly executed, coupled with phenomenal special effects. I have enjoyed it immensely, multiple times, since its release.",Dracula Untold
192,Diddisnap,Pleasantly Surprised,8,30 August 2015,"I saw Dracula Untold listed in the guide on cable and thought, why not, I'll record it and give it a shot at some point. I didn't expect much from this movie, mainly because there really hasn't been a truly good back-to- basics vampire movie since Bram Stoker's Dracula. Also, this one only runs a bit over 90 minutes, so how good could it really be? Well, I found that I was pleasantly surprised to learn that was quite good. This one goes back to the story of Vlad the Impaler, with a twist. Dracula Untold includes strong performances by Luke Evans as Vlad and Sarah Gadon as his wife, Mirena, along with great special effects and a well-written story. This movie deserves a Part 2, and I hope to see one!",Dracula Untold

It looks he wanted to repeat his sexual attraction for her in modern times, right? This is the biggest bullshit that this director of this movie did. The biggest!!! If he wanted to show us that story continues in nowadays, it is enough with the words of his prince son. Thats all! Everything was so nice and well-built. The story was special and interesting with new scenes and new elements of tale. The power of vampire after he drink that old vampire supposed to be more magic and with more vampire tricks. However it is so empty taste at the end of movie. And that old Dracula now in suit having a drink at the square...pfffff...bullshits...and he was waiting the Son of Devil for what?

It is believed Bram Stoker used Vlad's legend for his novel, that is where Dracula got his name from and now these two are combined.Do not watch this if you expect a horror's tale... it is a knight's tale action film with a dark fantasy layer and this one is very well made!",Dracula Untold
195,ringaile-miliauskaite,Not bad indeed,7,12 December 2014,"Not bad indeed. Nope it's not a horror story with a lots of blood and screams and shadows creeping in the night, it's more a story of love that ends bad but ends good, with good dose of action and heroism. Maybe it's not that Dracula that you expect after seeing all those movies and reading all the stories, but I would not say that it is worse. I liked it. Good way to spend the evening and not regretting it. My advice - do not expect the standard Dracula story (it's Untold after-all) and you will be fine.Overall - good movie for the evening after the hard days work and you won't regret paying the entry into cinemas.",Dracula Untold
196,just_for_movies,"Too short, but still very entertaining",8,20 October 2014,I was never a huge vampire fan and really never had interest in Dracula in general but this movie piqued my interest. I found out about this movie earlier this year and it sounded very cool. The trailers didn't really help get me more interested in the movie since I found them kind of bland. When I saw the movie though it immediately exceeded my expectations. Luke Evans was a great Dracula and all the supporting cast were also very good. Gary Shore did a great job directing on his first feature length movie. Visual effects were pretty cool too although there were some snafus here and there. Action and such stuff was also fun to watch. The story was probably the slight downfall of this movie. The characters weren't developed enough and just some other things could have been better. Also the movie was just too dang short. Especially the beginning could have been much more developed. All in all though this movie was very entertaining. It definitely exceeded my expectations and I would recommend people should give this a try. NOTE: This is not a horror movie!,Dracula Untold

Dracula was in love but it wasn't the only driving force in the whole film, which was refreshing and there was action and blood but not too much. It was just overall, very well done. I was honestly sort of expecting that ""trying too hard to be cool/sci-fi"" like Underworld, but I was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Sophisticated Dracula for the Modern~ Definitely go see it in theaters. It's worth the ticket price.",Dracula Untold

From the moment I saw him I knew he will be perfect match for this film. Charles Dance is another perfect match for the role he's playing. The Dracula story can be told in different ways, and I think the director did it perfectly. There were few occasions in the movie that I thought I knew what was coming - and I was surprised to see other direction was taken. Exactly as I like in movies. Without telling nothing about the plot progress, I can just say that it was so thrilling and fascinating, that I'm waiting to see what else will be with this myth character.",Dracula Untold
202,ekenaudra,"Underrated, very good movie",10,12 October 2014,"I just finished watching this on the ultra screen with 3 other people. We all enjoyed the movie very much and I'm honestly surprised to see that it got such a low rating on IMDb. Obviously people's opinions should be respected, but I feel that some of the reviews/ratings that I read we're marked obtusely low due to discrepancies in the historical story/time-line of the plot. I read one review where someone gave the movie a 3 simply because it was based 20 years previous to the actual historical time-line... I'am baffled that such an overlooked detail of the movie could warrant such an outraged review. I could understand if the person didn't care for the movie based on plot, acting, direction, etc. but to judge it harshly due to a time-line issue? Another review ranted about how Vlad and the sultan never met on the battlefield and how historically Vlad didn't kill the sultan, but merely grazed him with an arrow during a night attack... Well, Vlad didn't really turn into bats either, and he didn't really get turned by a master vamp trapped in a cave on a mountain. You people are insane, ""I don't like the movie because the actor didn't look like the real Vlad"" GREAT! Luke Evans is hotter than the real Vlad, and if I had to watch an 85 min long movie with a busted up face Vlad I wouldn't have made it a quarter of the way! You people need to start reviewing and rating the movie fairly, not simply based on your hurt feelings that it was set in the wrong year, or the actor wasn't ugly enough. If you have a real issue with the movie Ex: substance, plot, acting, cg, etc. then write about THAT not about the stupid historical geeky discrepancies!",Dracula Untold
203,oceanic_osprey,"Poor Dracula, his efforts are......in vein",6,6 October 2014,"Greetings all, It was high time a new Dracula-oriented film came about, the last being Dracula 2001 if memory serves. I was excited at the prospect of a modern-styled take on the infamous Vlad 'The Impaler' Tepes' origins. So let's get into the nitty-grttiy.Firstly, the resounding issue here, to me at least, was the feature length - estimating at a mere 92 minutes including credits. This time frame does not allow for enough character development of both the supporting cast or the lead himself. That being said, this is about Dracula, and he is given ample screen time to become empathised with. It became apparent that the structure left a lot to be desired in terms of pacing (which could be attributed to the short length). Often was the case that the film concertinaed into frantic portions which deserved a more gradual approach, and, conversely, the more lethargic sections could have been hurried along.Luke Evans does a fine job as the sharp-toothed anti-hero. I'd go as far as saying that his performance dwarfs the contributions of many here. Unfortunately Dominic Cooper delivers a forgettable performance to his role as Mehmed the Turkish Sultan. He could have just as easily been played by any of his anonymous henchmen and we'd be none the wiser. Praise must be given to Charles Dance, who is suitably creepy and demonic, and always brings a great presence to his scenes. I must confess I found Evans' and Dance's interactions fascinating, and they were the highlight of this film for me.The action does not fall short here, apart from suffering slightly with the dreaded, intermittent shaky-cam, there were some nice touches and special effects that will keep even the die hard actioners among us satisfied. Similarly with the cinematography, the film's style lends itself to displaying some wonderful shots in various Northern Ireland locations, to which I was most impressed. So the visuals can't be faulted.There is so little to mention about the rather unmemorable score, suffice to say that I could not remember one instance where it had any significant impact on the piece.Unfortunately due to time constraints and perhaps some big-screen inexperience from the debut director, the film is heavy on the action and light on substance. I would argue that the spectacle and lead alone are enough to sell this movie, albeit, at a slightly more disappointing calibre than one would have hoped. I did, however, find it an enjoyable watch, and thus would recommend it to you.",Dracula Untold
204,invernessmovieclub,Decent but lacks a little bite,6,3 October 2014,"Dracula is undoubtedly one of the most famous mythological creations in literature history. He has been brought to the big screen dozens of times since Bram Stoker penned the novel way back in 1897, however we know very little about where he came from – how did he turn into the legendary monster? Given the popularity of movie origins of late (Casino Royale, X-Men First Class, Batman Begins to name but a few), it's no surprise that a beginnings story for the Prince of Darkness has now arrived.We are advised in the opening voice-over and montage that Prince Vlad Tepes (Luke Evans) was once a brutal military leader, also known as Vlad the Impaler for the way he tortured and killed those he conquered. The introduction is swift and we soon find Vlad now living in peace in his castle with his wife and young son. When the invading Turkish army led by Sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) demands 1000 young boys, including Vlad's son, join his army – Vlad, knowing that he is severely outnumbered, seeks power from a higher source to help keep his family safe. His closest adviser tells him the myth of a Vampire named Caligula who can grant the strength of 1000 men, at a high price of course, and therefore Vlad seeks him out. The rest, as we know, is history. Dracula is played convincingly by British rising star Luke Evans and brings a subtle sadness to the darkness the role carries. The director, Gary Shore shows some nice visual touches given this is his debut full length movie – he made his name making highly acclaimed short films and has a bright future ahead of him. Canadian actress Sarah Gadon plays Vlad's wife Mirena and has a few decent moments but unfortunately the rest of the cast fail to make any impression. We are advised that Vlad and the enemy Sultan Mehmed were raised, almost as brothers, but this is only touched on briefly. The battle scenes are mightily impressive, especially after Vlad has gained his powers, taking on and swiftly defeating a huge army single handedly. However the rest of the movie feels slightly rushed – at only 92 minutes, Vlad's shady past could've been explored a little more. The ending is tied up nicely and leaves Dracula Untold open to further instalments. Box office takings will inevitably decide its fate. All in all Dracula Untold was a decent origins movie. It is worth seeing for the action and spectacle but dare I say it, lacks a little bite.",Dracula Untold
205,barosanescu,Very enjoyable,10,18 January 2015,"This new twist in the Dracula/vampire emporium reminds me of the revamped Star Trek series, which J.J. Abrams took to a new level. A better one.It is obvious that the movie has nothing to do with the real history of Vlad The Impaler. It was done the same way ""300"" and ""Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter"" were written - Hollywood style.I've read the bad reviews of the movie before I decided to see it for myself. Funny, as usual. Then I noticed the $70 million budget. Not too shabby, so it can't be that bad.The Turk reviewers are up in flames, just as the Iranians (they still consider themselves Persians) were, when ""300"" came out.As if Vlad was a real vampire, Xerxes was really 9 foot tall, and Abraham Lincoln was really killing vampires.Be serious people, look at the movie for its entertainment value. It is not history, it is not a documentary, it is not REAL. It is a money maker for Hollywood and it sells.Great effects, awesome new twist in this never ending vampire world.",Dracula Untold

208,alnu-930-982284,A most welcome turn of the story,8,20 October 2014,"It took several dozens of movies to have a turn in the proper direction for this story. It is amazing how many ideas some people have about this story and comforting to see how you are all debating about Bram Stoker's and all those rubber figures of the past. The thing is ... the real story would make you hide under your beds. Vlad ( Tzapash ) - to have his name correctly pronounced by English speakers - was a ruthless leader and a just man. His justice was many times taken to extremes, fact of which some Islam supporters are very aware. Yet lying about his death and deeds is not something I or any of my countrymen like. Impaling was reserved for invaders and traitors. Thieves had their hands cut off from the wrists, which I believe was also heavily practiced in the Islamic countries. The thing with the blood and its sucking is Stoker's touch over the ""Dracul"" nickname Vlad was given and its meaning - ""The Devil"" and the cruelty he has shown in more than a few occasions. The boyars ""boierii"" have assassinated Vlad for having their rows decimated in several occasions as a punishment for their lack of support of the national cause and vile behaviour against common people. Some hearsay also says the sultan paid for his assassination. The common sense however says that you should look first into your own yard and he was one of those few true leaders who died for the sole reason that they loved their people. This is the first American movie taking a proper turn in the story. Prepare for the truth. There is much more gore in it yet also much more beauty. And do not judge with your civic sense. It was a time when people did not meet over a beer to discuss whether they should or should not make war upon one another. Stoker's was funny, this is amusing ... it's getting warmer. The funny thing is that the real story could produce several Academy Awards, but the price of that would be killing the franchise ... umm not gonna happen.",Dracula Untold

If you love the genre, this movie imho is battling for the nr 1 position.Of course, if you read some reviews here (typically from a country that plays a leading role in the movie haha) people don't seem to understand fairy tales, myths, fantasy or science-fiction. The number one review at the top even states that the facts don't add up according to history. Others even pull the ""racism"" card, saying this film encourages hate against the Turks (lol whut? Turk is not a race, it's a nationality). For everyone else that does understand that vampires do not exist in real life but are probably the biggest bad-asses in fantasy: watch this movie! It's fantastic action, drama, a story about how the good guy ended up being a creature of Satan. Never a dull second in the whole movie.

211,nightwing90,Failed To Meet Expectations,4,5 November 2014,"""Anyone expecting a hardcore horror film will be a disappointed lot"". This is what director Gary Shore of Dracula Untold had to say and that's quite right as the title mislead you on many counts as the film try to give a new look and story to Count Dracula without any reference to Bram Stocker's Dracula. The film is a mix of action, adventure and drama that fails to evoke any sort of excitement though it had something to offer story wise. But that gets spoiled by a weak script and average performances except Luke Evans who appear as Transylvanian Prince Vlad Tepes.Tepes' s wife, his people, his young son and his Kingdom is threatened by Sultan Mehmed who wants thousand young boys from Transylvania including Tepes's son to join the army. To protect his people, kingdom and family, Tepes reach Broken Tooth Mountain where he meets a powerful vampire named Caligula and the two reach an agreement for making Tepez a powerful man who can fight any force. But this can happen after making some compromises as the deal will make him a blood thirsty vampire.The film showed some promise that gradually fades away making the it a disappointing movie. Literally, a golden chance to roll out an engaging piece of work gets wasted, thanks to poor performances and a below par script. So in summary this Dracula tale is a misconceived attempt that neither scare you nor does it make for a compelling watch. In the acting side, except Luke Evans and to an extent the actor who portrayed Caligula (largely aided by good make up) none could make an impact to score a point and that's a big letdown. Visual effects were not that great but cinematography was good with reasonably fine cuts and background score. So its a below par Dracula reincarnation by Gary Shore that fails to meet the expectations and I am going with four out of ten for the untold story of the master vampire.",Dracula Untold
212,gaxiola_fk,Dracula Untold - Review,7,22 November 2016,"Dracula Untold - Review Year: 2014 Director: Gary ShoreDracula Untold is an interesting and entertaining movie that won't bore you, the thing is that is nothing more than an action pack based on the mythical vampire. The introduction is well done, explaining where Vlad comes from and why he is the way he is. Then the main problem comes to the main character and getting rid of his son isn't an option so he get the powers of a vampire to save his kingdom. Is totally understandable the decision that Vlad took and the way he transforms into a vampire and the required condition are great. The vampire skills are developed like superpowers and in the first battle I wasn't expecting just him to finish with the Turkish army, I mean, a group of warriors and Vlad being the leader, but anyway. After the destruction of the first army Vlade takes all the people to another edification through the forest where he deals with the problems of being a vampire and tell his wife about it. I really hated the scene where he tries to save his wife from the death, that simply scene when he's flying down is awful, and all this to kidnap his son and unleash his rage against the Turkish. The fortress is destroyed and only some persons survived, so Vlad transform them into vampires to attack the Turkish encampment to finally save his son and in order to defend his son from the other vampires (that he created), he kill them all, so why was that for?. The script is not exaggerated and the characters are well justified, the choreography is good but I'd prefer if Vlad hadn't fight alone, I mean, less incredible. The special effects are good and bad at times with all this stuff of the skills gotten, the nightview, creatures control, batjump, batfly. Photografy is amazing plastering a European essence. I love the costumes especially Vlad's dragon armor and all his designs.Finally this is a good movie, not to be remembered but to spend a good time. What it offers is action and fantasy mixed with a hero and not a deep story. The death of the wife was an important part only for Vlad but no for the watchers. The interesting thing is that this in not done and the ancient Dracula is back. Also the film respected some original aspects from the story, which is good. Luke Evnas is excellent as Vlad and probably, he'll be back.",Dracula Untold
213,deanpjackson_1973,"Pretty decent actually, ignore the oddballs",10,12 January 2015,"I had to give it 10/10 due to the low score it had. Probably a 7 is more realistic. Its a very decent film and I found it very entertaining. Take it for what it is...a fantasy movie. Expect an entertaining Dracula movie, its what you will get. If you are an amateur film critic, and I stress amateur, or pretentious you will no doubt complain about 'character development' or 'flawed' plots.As for many of the others reviewers annoyed as it is not historically accurate. What! My god. That's like complaining that the Elves in lord of the rings didn't really speak proper Elvish. Does not and never did exist. Yes, Vlad Tepes existed, but he wasn't really a vampire, surprising, I know . The issue, if you were looking for historical facts, would not be that the year was wrong or that Sultan Mehmet didn't die in Transylvania, it would be that he wasn't really a vampire haha. It's gobsmacking bad logic. It is based on MYTH! Its like complaining that 'the never ending story' actually ended.The acting was fine, good in fact! There were no poor performances and the lead was as good as can be expected for such a film. Much better acting than most 'big name' Hollywood actors. Its worth the watch if you just want to be entertained for 90 minutes and don't want your thoughts 'provoking'.",Dracula Untold
214,scyphe,The 1/10 reviews/scores shouldn't be taken seriously,8,12 July 2021,"The main complaint I see in all the hate-reviews is that it's not historically correct or that it doesn't follow Bram Stokers book closely. Bram Stokers book Dracula isn't historically correct (there are no vampires), it's simply gothic horror fiction based on various folktales and historical characters and events. Even the 1992 movie ""Bram Stokers Dracula"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola doesn't follow the book by the letter, yet it won a ton of awards and reaped great respect and a huge following.Dracula Untold is an origin story where we follow Vlad III Dracul (aka Vlad III Tepes) at the end of the 15th century as his Wallachian kingdom (including the people and his family) are threatened with conquest/annihilation by the Turkish Ottoman invasion of Europe. We follow Vlad as he tries to defend his family and his kingdom only to find himself at the edge of destruction. In a desperate move he remember the tale as well as almost being killed by a powerful being and seeks out this creature of the night to ask for the power he needs to protect his kingdom against Mehmed II and the Ottoman army. The help/power he gets from this creature comes at a price that we are all familiar with.It's a fantasy movie that is based partly on Dracula as well as some historical events without attempting to turn it into a historically correct period movie. It's about the struggles and the destiny of a fictional Vlad III Tepes/Dracula.It's a great popcorn flick with good acting, great scenery and an interesting story, all presented with good visuals. I definitely recommend it.",Dracula Untold

If you're into an anti-hero type movie with pretty decent acting (for the genre) as well as plenty of action then watch it. I'd watch a sequel to it based on how much I unexpectedly enjoyed this one.Second, people that have issues with historical inaccuracies reflect on the idea that the movie just might be a ""fictional fantasy"" film, make your peace with that and then enjoy the movie.

216,kk-carrie,Great action movie.,8,25 August 2015,"I laughed when I read the reviews. Sure the idea and expectations you had in your mind affect your mood and perception while watching the movie. I expect actions and fantasy and cool superpowers which are fulfilled in this movie. I have no idea of the history of this movie based on (which had provoked so many people) so I was spared from the possible irksome moments while playing Dracula Untold. The plot is simple and decent (yes, it's kinda predictable) but what made it different from the genre alike movies is that I am satisfied with the 1 and half hours spent watching the plot twists and conflicts took place. They are well developed which not like others that I'd watched as if they are rushing to get to the end and that's it. And oh, yeah it has few place where it's kinda illogical(sigh...I would have rate it 10/10).I will try to read the history of the people in the movie later but so far, I am really happy spending 1 and half hour watching it.",Dracula Untold
217,mynban,Interesting beginning followed by a ridiculously horrible ending,4,18 December 2014,"It felt like the scenarist who wrote the first part did a very good research and had a solid scenario. Then some 15 years old kid took over the mantle of scenarist and completed the project. Seriously second half is that bad.They already established good side as Vlad, and bad side as Turks in the early part of the movie in a logical manner. Turks were on a campaign of conquest towards Europe and they were forcing young boys from other nations into Janissary service. More than enough material to picture Vlad as the noble defender defying an invading army.Then movie started making Turks act like total dicks at every opportunity they get, to the point that sultan were doing completely idiotic things for the sake of being an asshole. It did not strengthen my sympathy for Vlad or make me want him to defeat Turks; it only made me feel like I am wasting my time with just another blockbuster bad movie.If scenario kept going the way it did till the point Vlad made his deal; and he fought against an ambitious invading Emperor who would sacrifice all his army before giving up his pride, then I would have given a 9/10 to this movie. By turning into just another cliché sellout at mid movie, they managed to get it down to 4/10 from me.",Dracula Untold
218,francoatgrex,Hi(story) retold,10,1 February 2015,"I almost always read the reviews before watching a movie; and generally I find the negative type of reviews more pertinent, more critical and intelligent. This time I did the opposite: I watched the movie first then read the reviews. How insipid they seem: only a bunch of bitter pessimists who demand, express their needs and views and they demand while offering nothing in return they decry being 'ripped-off' of a few dollars (that is if they have legally watched the movie) because the concept of the story did not fit their expectations. I tell them shut up already you whiners, that's all you are good at - whining. This movie was impressive, I liked, it it delivered a good story, good values and high quality effects; overall great entertainment value. Until today I did not know that Vlad the impaler (Dracula) was a real historical Romanian hero who fought against the tyranny of the Ottomans. The stories (this and others of Dracula) of course are fictitious legends but what this movie did compared to previous others was to provide a more accurate background around the history. I do recommend it and also please do not be put off by the negative reviews, do like I had done: watch the movie then read the reviews and you'll see how silly they will be.",Dracula Untold
219,ss_areeb_h,Castlevania attempt - could have been better,4,8 November 2014,"Though most people commend the movie for bringing out the Dracula story in a new light, they forget(or more possibly do not know) that the movie is actually right out of the video game Castlevania. A hero forced to take the power of a vampire to save his family, and eventually becoming hated for who he is. However, instead of keeping with the fictional video game characters, the producers have miserably attempted to yet again to make it historical by displaying the turks as a very evil and cruel people torturing poor innocent vlad (if you check your history books the turks were so good to vlad and his brother that his brother actually ended up joining them while vlad, who since he was a child showed extreme violence and cruelty) Anyway history apart there are so many stupid things in the movie that put me off even when i don't look at it in the light of the game. Like the time mehmet made his whole army fight blind so they wouldn't see Dracula and be afraid. And when Dracula kills each and every enemy soldier but just chooses to push aside the one who just attempted to kill his family. Oh and this happens twice. Then one second every loves him as a hero, the next second sunlight falls on him, he starts ti burn and all the people are trying to kill him, and then another second later they mellow down. Aaaaand of course his wife cant die .well technically she did but you know she is going to be reborn (which totally happens) And then when you compare it to the game. An epic storyline messed up by the producers. There were so many elements in the game that would make this movie so awesome, and which the producers totally omitted. I wanted this movie to be good. But sadly it just made me pity the lost opportunity",Dracula Untold

221,gabestoian,One of the best Dracula movies ever made.,8,29 June 2016,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Sumptuous production with good looking actors and plenty of cgi, fairly restrained acting by a large cast of characters sharing the screen pretty homogeneously. What I liked about it was a sense of balance between style and substance. Some critics gave it low score due to historical inaccuracies and I agree to an extent, but how many Dracula movies are historical really? And since when would Hollywood let the truth get in the way of a 'good story'?..:) This film at least has a go at the historical Dracula without trying to give a history lesson to an audience who in large part doesn't really care. What it does, it might trigger curiosity in the viewer as to who was this Dracula character which they hitherto thought was merely a fictional character invented by Bram Stoker. I'm not sure that enough is known of the historical Vlad (the impaler) to write up an accurate account of his life, least to say he was not a vampire.. :) if there ever was one.. But that's just my opinion.. :)",Dracula Untold

223,lezboyd,"All CGI, no substance. Not a good start to a movie-verse.",3,21 January 2015,"Universal Pictures are trying to build a movie universe on top of this pile of crap!? Good luck to them! The whole thing looked like a poor man's version of Van Helsing, released over a decade ago. That movie also tried to ""reinvent"" the monster genre as an action movie, and while I personally liked that movie, the audience at large disagreed then, and I am not sure they will agree now after watching this one. I don't.The one thing I noticed, and could not forget afterward about it was that they tried to paint Vlad as a humane person, doing what he did to save his family and his children. That is like some movie a couple of centuries from now, making Hitler out to be a humane person, because the movie industry has run out of ideas about Hitler. I found this disturbing, and could not enjoy the movie after that. Vlad even explains that impaling an entire village was necessary to save ten. Now imagine this same argument being made by Hitler in a movie 2 centuries from now! Revolting!There is nothing new in the story, its the same old crap of conquerors at the gate, ruler tries to save family with odds against him, epic fight, blah blah. Dracula suddenly had powers that he never ever had before in the mythology, like able to make a herd of bats form precise fist like shapes in the air and punch the massive Turk army with said bat-fists, controlling the weather so there is cloud cover during daytime (how convenient!), and so on. The mythology within the movie itself is not adhered to, like Vampire-prime being able to be free of his curse after turning Vlad, but Vlad unable to do so after turning tens of people. Makes one wonder how they plan to stick to an over-arching mythology across the entire planned movie-verse. Heck, they could not even nail accents correctly. Why are ROMANIANS talking with British accents!? Why are Turks talking...unlike Turks!? The presence of certain characters are totally unexplained, like the dude who first tries to cajole Vlad into drinking his human blood, and then revives Vlad again after the finale battle. Neither his motivations, nor his intentions are made clear. Heck, we don't even get his name.Universal needs to take a lot of production cues from Marvel if they really want to make their movie-verse successful. Like, do not mess with powers associated with long-established characters, do not try to force a sense of mystery, and more importantly have a cohesive story, with special effects only aiding said story! I think I have ranted enough. Just one more thing....anyone feel that the Queen's death sequence was totally channeling Gwen Stacy's death sequences from The Amazing Spiderman 2?? Originality, people! Please!",Dracula Untold
224,teddyackerdude,Dracula could have remained Untold,4,1 February 2015,"Firstly, if you are looking for a accurate historical film this will not be it. Then again, where the legend of Dracula is concerned historical accuracy will be pretty hard to confirm for obvious reasons.Secondly, the movie. From the outset I was not expecting much of it. As long as no one sparkled I would have been very happy. The CGI was very well done and the idea behind this story was good but, it just felt pointless and it was boring. What frustrated me was the fact that his wife falls of a cliff but she still look pretty good after plummeting for a considerable amount of time. Then, after Vlad goes through the whole ordeal of becoming a vampire to save his son and his fellow country men and he turns these country men into vampires as well he then proceeds to kill them all just to again save his boy. He does this even though at the beginning of the movie Vlad makes a clear point of saying he will do anything to save his countrymen and the people who trust and believe in him. I understand this is supposed to be a hard decision for our boy Vlad to make but thinking about it logically if he just gave up his son as the 1001st child to the Turkish everything would have probably turned out better. His wife would have still been alive, his son would have been educated by one of the most advanced regimes of it's time and he would not have had to kill a generous number of his fellow country men.If you are a massive fan of the whole Dracula genre than by all means watch the movie and I'm sure it will entertain you. If you are looking for a entertaining movie with a fresh outlook on an old story then I would give it a skip.",Dracula Untold

Also the history shows that Mehmat-al- fetih died naturally much long after the death of Vlad (Dracula).Luke Evans is a good actor and I liked his work in the Hobbit series but not in this movie.He took the one of the character which history recognise as a negative one which this movie tried to show a sympathetic one by introducing his love for his child.",Dracula Untold

Sexy, mysterious, NOT PREDICTABLE, not ""kiddy"" and too ""blockbuster"" like. Luke plays this role with superior vulnerability and power. He is amazing.I love how the movie evolves, the goon in the cave,,,how every scene Dracula is in charge. I hate movies that make the ""hero"" weak and get kicked around. Even the last scene where he was in silver..at end when he whipped around in face..like he was toying with him all the time.Loved the bat scenes..how his face changed to so cool, scary, creepy..the growling!!! Not the fake, phony plastic faces that some movies do. Everything about this movie was so cool.Please bring back Luke Evans and do a sequel. LOVED the ending..I hope I read wrong that Universal is not putting this on side as it was by far SUPERIOR to the ridiculous 2017 tom cruise Mummy. That movie sucks so bad. Predictable, too childish, too starlet chasing Tom ..havent we seen enough of this. Mummy reminds me of the Indiana Jones..tough guy, girl..then everything is laughable and over done with special effects.This movie, is NOT OVERDONE. Scenes are super cool without being too fake. It is a great movie. I should know.I watched it 5 times.Universal, you need more believable scary movies..with mystery and story..not junk like Mummy..if that is direction you are going..you are losing all ""adult"" fans.If you however, bring Luke back and more movies like this Drakula Untold..you will have way more fans and loyal new ones. Im so sick of the kid types..and the starlet famous lead ones..how many transformer type movies do we have to tolerate (or better ignore) before we get a really good spook flick.

Also Luke Evans did a great job portraying Vlad. The ending was best part of the film. It left a mystery and hype.

236,tinusa007,Better than I expected,8,8 November 2014,"When I saw trailer to this new Dracula I didn't really like it. I thought it would be really cheese and cheap looking so when I started to watch it my, expectations were really low. But I have to say I was hooked from the very start. Which may have something to do with the fact that Luke Evans is a very intriguing person by the way he looks, talks and acts. So before I start really getting into the movie and what I liked or didn't like about it, I would like to say that with these kind of movie I really don't care if they have historical facts right. This is a fantasy movie based on a book. Because any Dracula ever made will be put together with the ultimate Dracula by Bram Stoker. And this version of Dracula or the one played by Gary Oldman or any other never existed. So why does it matter how they change the facts if it is for a movie? I don't feel like people cared this much when Quentin Tarantino killed Hitler in a movie theater or Abe Lincoln haunted vampires. So the last thing I am looking for while watching any kind of vampire movie or fantasy movie are facts from history. I watch for the blood and darkness and Luke's hotness.So after getting that from my chest I have to say I really enjoyed this Dracula. I like that for once he wasn't really a monster by a choice or by force, but because he didn't see any other choice to protect his family. He did what he saw as an opportunity to be the ultimate protector for his people. He didn't see the consequences it may cost him. Or the fact that by damning himself he will make his own people turn on him in a way.By saying that I want to state that I really like the choices that the script writer made. If I count down how many times we saw the same Dracula, or way too similar. It is one too many, meaning there really didn't need to be the 2014 TV Show. Even though I love Jonathan Rhys Meyers this TV Show really didn't deliver the vampiristic sensation it could have i fit have a different storyline. So everything original is worth giving a chance to if you love vampires. And I bet you, that you didn't see a Dracula quite like this. The CGI was pretty sweet and dark. I mean I don't find Romania to be that dark all the time and I've been there so I can tell, but I get that the darkness was supposed to come from Vlad's powers.But to not put this movie to the highest pedestal I find Evans's growls when he got mad a bit over dramatic and overplayed and not necessary at all. We get he was angry when he dies, when Mirena died and when he almost died again. But to just look at the moon and growl is a bit too cliché to repeat it that many times in such a short amount of time. Also I think the music could have been a little bit better chosen either a little bit darker or more climatic. For me the music didn't really play any part in the movie which in a way is good, that means the movie get me a few chills just by itself which rarely happens.",Dracula Untold

Sequence of movie was balanced and acting from every villain to prince himself generated this rating of 6.3 on IMDb. I had a feeling of game of thrones in it which i loved and of course the last scene .. let the games begin .. was not bad at all ! Alas the movie give a little feeling that Muslims are actually the target and the sole purpose of this movie was to evoke feelings like as people did not accept the great victories of Muslim rulers :P and so they showed flags of KALMA written on them and showed their characters very week, cruel and cowards perhaps .. no need to do that you could have made a movie without presenting Muslim rulers so pathetic :P BUT honestly if you take out the history .. movie itself is enjoyable and at the end its just a video to enjoy its graphics and effects not to make your mind about the history after watching it :P Music could have been better if Hans Zimmer would have done it .. but i guess budget was not enough :P Luke again was impressive !

239,edwardanthony9,"Enough to entertain, but fail to dramatize...",6,4 October 2014,"It's always intriguing with an origin story, because it allows viewers to experience the change, in this case the man who will then become the monster we know as Dracula. This film did just enough on that part, while being sufficiently entertaining as an action flick. But it came with many minor flaws, one that culminates in a less overall dramatic experience.On the good part, the action sequences were great, supported by some well worked visual effects. The cast is also brilliant, most notably Luke Evans and Charles Dance. Dominic Cooper portrayed a bad guy for the second time this year, and though he can perform, he never really looked the menacing villain. He never felt like a threat and neither was his men, so there was little suspense throughout the film. There was more suspense towards the very end, but it did not culminate in a fight, promptly ending the movie in it's rather short running time.As an untold story, it's good to see the reasons and the set up as to how this man had to become the monster, yet it was not properly explored. The case was that Vlad was supposed to resist the temptation of human blood, but it was never explored in depth except for one initial moment. It could have been more dramatic if more scenes show of his struggle, and then maybe along with the repercussions that he may be hurting his own family because of this, which will ultimately be way more dramatic. Several other details like this were not properly explored, which made it a rather straightforward story, enough to make the plot move, but not to make it a dramatic experience.VERDICT:Good: Great action sequences, Decent visual effects, Excellent castBad: Many minor flaws in the plot, Little suspenseSCORE: 6.5(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)",Dracula Untold

Vlad doesn't want to be appear as weak to his people, so the man goes to his last resort: Caligula, a demon who turns Vlad into a vampire to fight the sultan's army within 3 days, but there's a catch...He has to fight while keeping away from the thirst, or he'll be a vampire forever. Luke Evans is brooding as Dracula and actually showing he could carry a movie like this on his own. As the protagonist of the film, it was easy to root of him and want to win this war, but then again, he could be seen as the antagonist as well, with everything he touches he destroys in his own world. The film had a good supporting cast, but it was still lacking. The plot line felt rush. It moved quickly until the end, but it would leave wanting more. The film is a just two minutes over of a hour and a half. I wanted to go farther in on how his life went after the beginning. The man had did so much in oh so little time.

BUT, If you want to watch a masterpiece which was thought over, constructed logically and nicely integrated with ""real historical events and people"", was taken by an objective perspective, this is not a movie you are looking for. I am not only talking about the chronological part (years and wars which will be mentioned in movie). But even the events and relations of the characters were poor. The script is written offensively against Turks, and Turkish that was spoken in scenes was a disappointment. Seriously, can't you find some people who can speak Turkish? Or are those actors really that bad at learning how to pronounce some foreign words? I think not. But If you want to make a movie to offense some people, these of course are to be ignored.

242,alanlovoe,Great underrated movie,8,15 January 2021,"Having scarcity of movies at the beginning of 2021, I found myself revisiting some movies in Netflix from the past that I thought were good. That's how I rewatched with this movie today.
I can say that after more than 6 years from its release this movie it's still rock solid.
--- THE FOLLOWING IS SPOILER FREE UNTIL THE LAST FEW PARAGRAPHS, I WILL WARN YOU WHEN I START THE SPOILERSThere is a bunch of nysayers and fanatics from Stocker's novel that keeps ranting about this film, however they are just closed minded and missing the point of movies and the beauty of reimagining a story.Dracula Untold, definitely goes away from the traditional Stocker folklore, and provides a fresh start with the origin of the fearless Vlad Tepes Dracul which is based on the real historic figure Vlad III or Vlad Tepes the III, Vlad the Impaler. Here is where most people start getting confused. This is not the novel, this is a reimagination of Vlad Tepes III and crossover the myth of vampires from Romania. Of course there are connections / inspirations that Stocker draw from Romian culture and the use of the house of Dracul may be where the connection stops. The same goes for this movie.
The story of Vlad mixed with the romanian vampires is perfect, gives a rich story that could be entertaining, which for most accounts in all reviewers this makes a great deal of entertaining, most criticism goes in rants like ""this is not Dracula"", ""this is not accurate"", ""this is not the story"", which is plainly dumb in my opinion.
Especially considering that 6 years before this movie came out people were applauding a movie where vampires shines like fairies (not pun intended, it's actually more close to a fairy creature).I like this is more in line like other reimagined views of Dracula like the videogame saga that more recently got a great animated series ""Castlevania"" or even Blade as he goes into that alternative mythology as well. Although I prefer Castlevania point of view for this analogy as resembles more what Dracula Untold stands for.This story and film has a lot of potential, and could have made a great saga that reshape the way we see this character to something less horror like. This brings action sequences closes to what the Underworld saga does for the dark world mythology, which is refleshing to see in this character that has been poorly treated outside the traditional Stocker inspired movies.To not extend more in this review I would say this is a great movie, a great reimagination of the Vlad Tepes mythology (which is not the same as Bram's one) and I see there is a missed potential here.-- SPOILERS FROM HERE ON -- YOU'VE BEEN WARNEDThe only aspects to be fair in my review that I don't like, are probably the duration of the movie, another 30 or 40 min would have been great to expand character development and have a more visceral take on the action scenes and even in the resolution after the death of the Sultan, the fight (or lack of) between Vlad and his recently converted friends and citizens could have had more drama, with an escape scene showing the monk and the boy and a final action take between Vlad and the vampires until he finally makes the last sacrifice by opening the sky.All an all I think even if that would have been ideal is very well told as a story and delivers in a great matter.
The only thing that I really wish they have not messed up is the final scene where they jump to the future / present day and he finds the reincarnation of Mirena, I just really wish they would not have used ""Mina"" as her name because that draws back attention to those arguments about ""this is not the story"". I wish they have actually made the effort to go away and maybe make an omage like showing Vlad watching one of the Bram stocker Dracula movies.Other than that this is to me is a great movie, something I would really love to see a sequel if some studio (or Netflix / Amazon.. wink wink) is courageous enough to take (against the nysayers).Please watch it!",Dracula Untold
243,duke78ro,Pretty good,8,8 November 2014,"First off I'll start by quoting one of my countryman here, who said that this is as historically accurate as the movie 300. It's funny how people get offended and take a fantasy movie so personal.To clear this out, there's plenty of resources on the web to read about the historical figures and the events of Vlad Tepes reign over ... of course, Wallachia not Transylvania. He is a national hero for us, Romanians and his most prominent feat was ""The Night Attack"", not the impaling and the so-called ""mindless bloodshed"". On the other hand, Mehmed the Conqueror is one of the greatest ottoman rulers so one should definitely read about him.But back to the movie, even inaccurate and sometimes blatantly stupid, the historical background elevates the already worn Bram Stocker's story to an original and interesting new chapter of Dracula's, his origins. And indeed, it needs new blood to shake off dozens of clichés and to turn it into a ""what happens next"" versus ""meh"" viewer response. To sum this up, clothing is good, main characters' actors just about average, CGI good enough to immerse you, story maybe too ""epic"", but OK, overall I'd give this an 8 and I'd recommend you to see it with an opened mind.",Dracula Untold

But when are you American film-makers going to grab a history book and read that Vlad Tepes had nothing to do with Transylvania?Basic historical facts: - Vlad Tepes, son of Vlad Dracul, was a ruler in Wallachia (NOT Transylvania) - his castle is named Bran (not Castle Dracula, wtf!) and is in the mountains indeed, but still belongs to Wallachia, not Transylvania+1 for mentioning that ""Dracul"" meant ""The Dragon"" in old Romanian language, referring to the Order of Dragon that Vlad's father was part of. Only in the recent history has ""Dracul"" become a synonym for ""The Devil"".Anyway, I was ready to accept all historically wrong facts and enjoy the movie. But I could not.The plot was so bad with so many inconsistencies and underdeveloped characters that I don't know what to begin with.I don't want to spoil so I will not bring exact details, but here's what happens in this movie: - there are characters who appear out of nowhere in 1 or 2 scenes, who apparently have an important part in the story, but we get to know absolutely NOTHING about them - nobody in the Turkish army seems to have any fear whatsoever after witnessing an extremely powerful, supernatural force; they see Dracula killing soldiers like crushing ant with a boot, yet the Turkish generals remain cocky and eager to fight him with... well... a sword. - the dumbest idea I have ever seen of how to prevent soldiers fear Dracula before going to fight him... watch and amazeOverall, a very bad movie.

248,thegolden_idea,watch and enjoy; Dracula is not yet dead,7,11 October 2014,"I do not know the reason for criticizing this movie except that people are expected a higher level of action, horror, or story line. But just to say it bluntly, this movie is a definitely worth watching. It contains many fighting scenes. Moreover, the storyline and the special effects of Dracula are pretty good comparing to other vampires movies. Even thought the director Gary Shore has no long experience, he did an amazing job for reemerging a legendary character such as Dracula. Regarding acting, I liked all of the actors especially Luke ""Dracula"" and except Charles Dance ""vampire master"" for some reasons; first is that his Game of throne character as a Lannister overwhelm his act; also, his presence added a little vagueness to the movie. For example, he appeared alone hiding at the beginning of the movie, but he became a near normal human at the end. Furthermore, ""Let the game begins"" is a wrong choice as a statement for the vampire master character because it may referred to that vampires were exist before, so, the idea of the first vampire disappeared and the seriousness, too.This movie is not a horror movie like some people think. It is more fantasy than horror (it is a PG-13). Overall, I clapped after seeing it. Though the director and the writers have a promising future, I wanna see their next move like Gods of Egypt. I gave it a solid 7.5/10 because I enjoyed watching it. Not reaching an 8 because I think it could've been done better in movie as this one.",Dracula Untold
249,guifig-gf,"Absolutely amazing movie, excellent cinematic experience.",7,27 October 2014,"Untold Dracula, a film that is well worth checking out. The first point of the film that makes it deserving of a good assessment is the cast: Luke Evans (The Hobbit), Art Parkinson, Charles Dance and Paul Kaye (Game of Thrones). The Second positive point for the film is the courage of director Gary Shore to embrace a project of this size, his second movie as director. The special effects are incredible, deserves my 8 dollars for IMAX 4K, the Soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones, Clash of Titans) transforms the film, making it unique of the theme explored. Some 4, 5 scenes of the film are unique even in global cinema, like the scenes of Mirena's fall, and the redemption of Dracula. The film makes your heart beat stronger in the action scenes, nothing could be further improved, when Dracula attacks, you will lose your breath, feeling the drama of an amazing way, that only the best films can achieve. Watch it, you will not regret, the film explores a broad universe in a new way, without fear, and very well done.

You may be different though. I don't generally care for this type of movie, so I was close-minded from the beginning.If you like vampire movies or medieval movies, you might want to see this one, maybe you'll enjoy it. If you are like me though, I would advise you to save your money or see something else.While I didn't care too much for the acting, I must admit, Luke Evans did a great job, so if you are a fan of his in particular, you might want to see this film.

I actually really enjoyed it! I liked that the movie addressed human nature, love, family, and Dracula (Luke Evans) was in fact depicted as the protagonist which I assumed would be the opposite for Dracula.Shore did a grand job creating remarkable visuals and breath-taking battle scenes. It was reminiscent of films 300 and Gladiator. It was also an interesting and different take on your typical blood-sucking, non-remorseful vampire. Dracula was given a conscience and morals and this made me empathise with him and understand his reasoning for his actions. A pleasant surprise and captivating. 2^^",Dracula Untold
252,scott_brierley,Enjoyable,7,11 November 2014,"This re-telling of an ""untold"" story is in a tricky position in terms of genre...it isn't horror (being that it isn't in the least bit scary) or pure fantasy (given its ""real-world"" setting)...neither is it an action-packed, drama laden epic. It is however, entertaining. Despite its short run time it manages to feel un-hurried and there is at least some motivation behind the characters actions.It isn't an historically accurate time-line of events that is immediately immersive or compelling. What it ""is"", is an enjoyably action orientated telling of a much-loved anti-hero.The special effects are special enough not to over-whelm the story line, which is told through a simplistic but not child-like view-point. While it may never be considered ""ground-shaking"" or a classic Dracula movie it is also not a dull experience.I enjoyed it as an undemanding action movie of its era...not too long until its forgotten, but enjoyed at the time nonetheless",Dracula Untold

And then she commits suicide, and he, Vlad, curses God in the church - hence the curse ...

254,Movie-Scene-by-Temo,"Sometimes the world doesn't need another hero, sometimes what it needs is a monster.",9,5 April 2019,"Historically there was a man named Vlad or Dracula, who as a lad was given by his father, a Transylvanian ruler, to the Turks as allegiance to be brought up in Islamic ways and trained in warfare. The Turks created a killing machine, the ultimate warrior whose name was enough to turn enemy armies on their heels. His signature stamp was the impaling of thousands. Vlad returned to rule his (Christian) country in 1462 Transylvania, modern day Romania.The movie picks up at this point in which Vlad (Luke Evans) has ruled in peace for 10 years, when Turkish leader Sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) sends a demand that the Transylvanians pay jizyah, a head or poll tax that early Islamic rulers demanded from their non-Muslim subjects, plus 1,000 youths for his army. Vlad's people are horrified and outmanned, and Prince Vlad is forced to seek alternative means of satisfying the Turks. He offers himself in place of the boys, the Sultan refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition. Negotiations have failed, and Vlad is forced to seek alternate means to vanquish the Turkish armies that will no doubt fall upon them. The means has to be monumental. Vlad the Impaler, son of Dracul, transforms himself (temporarily) into a one-man unstoppable force and self-proclaimed Son of the Devil: the ultimate vampire (founded on Bram Stoker's 1897 novel 'Dracula') who can transform, fly, and has super sensory perception. But can a man, loving husband and father and protector of his people, ever come out ahead by making a pact with evil?70 million dollars invested in a set of first-timers-feature director Gary Shores and writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless-has paid off big time. Evans (The Hobbit, Fast & Furious 6, No One Lives, The Raven, Immortals) plays the charismatic, compassionate hero with style and grace, and his commanding good looks are well suited to the beast transformations and restrained eroticism as is his use of voice. But it is questionable whether someone who grew up committing inhumane atrocities can really allow himself to be as vulnerable and expressive as Evans in the constantly conveyed love for his wife and son, or the smouldering tension in some scenes. His wife is played by Sarah Gadon (Mutant X, Life with Derek, Flashpoint), as Mirena, who has little to do but stand by her man. Cooper (Need for Speed, Fleming (TV Mini-Series), Reasonable Doubt, Mamma Mia!, Sense and Sensibility (TV Mini-Series)) as Mehmed the Conqueror is disappointing: he sounds and acts as he did playing Saddam Hussein's son Uday and body double Latif in The Devil's Double (2011). However, Oscar awarded costume designer Ngila Dickson (The Lord of the Rings, Blood Diamond, Xena: Warrior Princess) does not disappoint.Brilliant cinematography, the animations are epic with strategic bat swarms forming at the hand and command of their master, Dracula. The sky darkening and changing that are so necessary for preserving Dracula's strength are suitably gripping. The sound effects are rich: deep rumbling, growling, earth moving. The historical connections are interesting. The editing may have been better, some scenes were too short or under developed to allow the full emotional effect, I presume this was to keep the movie within the PG 13 range.Having watched numerous versions of Dracula, this is one of the best, and the change from rampaging, blood-thirsty, unfeeling, sex-consumed creature to a thoughtful, militarily strategic, loving hero is novel. It is entertaining and a movie worth watching. My hope is that it being the first in the Universal monster franchise revamp rollout, its impact is not diluted with the expected crossover into the upcoming series of movies.",Dracula Untold

It is not supposed to present the historical events of that era. It is a movie based on the myth of Dracula. This is what you are going to watch. Therefore, it is really good for its genre. It is what I expected it to be, it had some good action scenes, a love theme, the battle of evil and good etc. etc. The actors did a good job and I actually enjoyed my Saturday night.

256,Awesomephant,Son of the Dragon becomes Son of the Devil,7,3 October 2014,"Dracula Untold tells us the story of how Prince Vlad ""The Impaler"" Tepes of House Dracul (Son of the Dragon) became Dracula (Son of the Devil).This Gothic tale takes place after Vlad's days as the Impaler are over, with him ruling over Transylvania as a seemingly peaceful monarch. His kingdom, however, owes fealty to the Turkish empire, which is governed by Sultan Mehmed II ""The Conqueror"". One day, the sultan makes a demand too difficult for Vlad to fulfill, forcing him down the path to acquire dark powers and become the so feared Dracula.The movie explores quite superficially the topics of sacrifice and what it means to be a vampire, focusing more on the ""concrete"" plot instead. In other words, the film is more action driven than it will make you ponder about what you're watching, which is a shame. I would have rather seen a balance between both. Nonetheless, the special effects and fighting sequences are pretty nice, never becoming too dull or over the top. There's this interesting part where we're following a battle and as one of the soldiers goes down, the camera zooms in on his sword and we continue watching the combat taking place around him reflected on his blade.In terms of horror, unfortunately there's very little of it. There are only two moments I consider remotely creepy, and both are when Charles Dance is on screen! Dracula Untold was no way near as scary as I would have liked it to be, though it is also worth noting that the only genres attached to this film are Action, Drama, and Fiction.The tale also shares with us the relationship between Vlad and his wife Mirena, even though the first 3/4 of their arc is not very memorable. Still, one of the most visually stunning and touching scenes in the movie involves Vlad and Mirena and that you will likely not forget any time soon.The first half of the film was superior to the second, as it was packed with potential and build up, though I personally believe the movie could have benefited from an extra 30-45 minutes to flesh out the characters, the story, and the universe some more. There were also several moments throughout the whole flick where I found myself shrugging because they were too awkward or made little sense.The movie, though its plot is concluded, is left open ended, so a sequel could come to be without it being misplaced, albeit said sequel would definitely be a very different film...In the end, I had a good time.

For those who missed the movie in theaters, please watch on Blue-ray as the movie has been shot with a smooth cinematic effect and the effects are very restrained, not over powering the script and story line. That coupled with Luke Evans' acting where despite the various nuances of the character that he displays, he never goes overboard. The movie is fast paced, engaging and has dosages of action and drama and they tactfully leave it open for a sequel, wetting viewers' curiosity.

259,aimee-837-243757,A beautifully crafted version of Dracula. Worth the watch,10,12 October 2014,"First and foremost I know it's appalling that I am giving this a 10 but because I went to watch this movie knowing fully that I ought to disregard the true history of it and the classic Dracula novel from 1897 Gothic horror by Irish author Bram Stoker. I kept and open mind and my mind was blown away. Luke Evans is an amazing actor that carried out such a brilliance performances. I was so moved by the internal struggle he was portraying as a good hearted prince Vlad to the demon that he was becoming Dracula. I felt for his character deeply. It may have been a short movie in comparison to most movie out there but in that short period of time, I thought it was beautifully told how much he loved his wife and his son. How much he cares for his country and the length a good prince would go through to protect what he holds dear to him heart. The cinematography was very beautifully artsy. It is not like 300 where there is unnecessary blood and gore. It's more artistic and tastefully done. No need for all those gore. This movie isn't about horror or violence's. It's about how he became Dracula. It's about the person he was before all the evils. About a men that gave everything to save the things he love and the ultimate sacrifice he made to protect his family. I know there are a lot of bad criticism out there for this movie because it's not gore enough or there isn't enough bloody mess and also some that say that the special effect was a joke but I think it's definitely worth the watch and I think this movie is worthy of being in the ""good movie "" category. The special effects may not be as good as lord of the ring or 300 but considering the budget wasn't as high as those other movies, this movie surpassed all of them. It's worthy of a movie that is consider a better movie than most out there. Give it a chance. You will not regret it.",Dracula Untold
260,IllogicalGenius,Cannot believe the poor ratings!!!,10,15 November 2014,"First off I'd like to address the 'historically inaccurate' claims. You do realise this is meant to be a proposed prequel to a f-i-c-t- i-o-n-a-l b-o-o-k!! Also Vampires -aren't real anyway!- And please correct me if I'm wrong but I have not seen any claims that it is meant to be historically accurate, unlike such films as 'King Arthur' making false claims and then sodomising the legend. Or even 'The young Victoria' which changed real-life events to be more palatable as a movie. Yes, it's based off Vlad the impaler...based...-based- not true to life!OK...breathe.....bbrrreaatthheee.... ...I will try to maintain composure for the rest of this review.Luke Evans literally carried this movie and as the title character, rightly so, mirrored well whilst playing Vlad/Dracula he was carrying the weight of the world and the entire movie. Although Gadon was not the first choice for Mirena I feel her milk- white and sunny-gold complexion complemented the darkness in Vlad harmoniously as well as being the physical embodiment of Vlads desire to escape his past constantly proving her unrelenting faith in him.Admittedly I would've liked to have seen more character development from Vlads right hand men and his opponent it would've been more emotive upon their demise that and more interaction with the people he rules over but I'm sure due to timing constraints and the issue of movie-pacing would've slowed it down. Perhaps something for the extended directors cut of the DVD, which I hope to Vlad they do.I'm not sure I liked Cooper in this role, perhaps due to under- development his role felt weak. I think I would've liked to have seen him play Mehmed as a slightly hot-headed, possibly mentally deranged sycophant. For whatever reason he comes off slightly bland. I feel it's unfortunate as I seem to recall quite liking his role in '...Vampire hunter'.Other than that I find this movie faultless....that and I'm not entirely sure the bats shown were vampire bats, but they have to be one of the ugliest bats so perhaps they would've only distracted the viewers with their unsightly faces, though did they have to be vampire bats?Albeit their intent was clear to highlight..and under line Vlads struggle between his past/present/future, the true and deep passion he has with his wife and their bond with their son. To set up for the teaser at the end which would go on to hint at Vlad and Mirena/Mina being re-united, which as having read the book I am thrilled they made this connection as it gives Dracula another dimension, despite being the title character of Bram Stokers novel Dracula is under-developed and seen going after any attractive female. Placing Mirena as Mina is for lack of a better word, perfect. I really feel Dance's character could indeed turn out to be Van Helsing in any possible sequel which seems to be heavily implied. The action sequences I felt were fresh, so many blockbuster films with star-studded casts with great battle scenes start to feel samey. I really feel the director executed these sections in a tantalising and individual way. The entire movie brought me from a near sleep-like state to wide awake and on the edge of my seat. I hope all who were involved in this movie are not discouraged by the poor reception and go on to make their own version of a sequel to their film. Great historical geniuses and the like were oft unpopular in their day yet went on to be celebrated throughout the centuries. Fingers crossed this film becomes something of a cult classic come it's DVD release.",Dracula Untold
261,phoenix-caner,Who is worse than a vampire? A Turk.,1,9 October 2014,"Well, in most content which include antic or middle ages style in it always has a thing against the ""easterner"" figure, but in this movie it seems finally they decided to put it in a shape. As Turks.Personally I think this closely related to the position of the Ottoman empire in world stage in those days. During its 700 years of rule, Ottoman empire managed to grow big enough to be a superpower of the day and kept that place for 200 years. Yes Ottoman empire was not formed by saints. But it barely deserve this. I bet nobody thought Vatican's demonization of Turks would be this effective back then. There are even some commenters putting some known terrorist organizations in sentences like equals with Turks. Its like Nazis demonizing Jews to legitimate their killings. Aren't we better than this? Anyone with some skills with google can find who really count Vlad was and the practices at Ottoman empire (although this part might be a little controversial because of propaganda efforts) So I will not go trough them and bore you with realities. But I will say that there are many errors. If the producers decided to go fantastic about Vlad why put real figures against such made up character and humiliate people?That would be really ironic if people of the future mention USA the way producers did to Ottomans in this movie. Not impossible considering the last 50 years of USA.",Dracula Untold

Once again the critics are so wrong these days especially when ""Hansel and Gretal : Witch Hunters"" (2013) was released in theaters it was poorly received because it was plain and simple the critics didn't like it because it was too violent, bloody and sexist. Yet audiences reviewed the film positively and it enjoyed the entertainment they were receiving from just like with this underrated and unappreciated dark fantasy gem ""Dracula Untold"". That's my complaint and now for my criticism, the movie was too fast paced I'll say, I wish that the movie was a bit longer: it left me wanting more and left with many questions than answers; although I like a bit of mystery I just wanted more. The storyline was okay yet had so much potential and needed some depth the give the story some heart. Luke Evans, bow down, is amazing, brilliant and wonderful with his performance, yes despite this film flaws, Luke Evans did a fantastic job and with what he could do and showcase his acting chops as leading man. Charles Dance was creepy and ugly (good thing because he gave me the creeps) and everyone did okay but Dominic Cooper (although brilliant in his own way) was poorly miscast. Not enough character development either for our heroic monster nor his evil master, it wasn't enough and the audiences were left wanting more from our protagonist; to let our Dracula breathe and show more of his character despite Luke Evans giving it all and that's a well respected praise for such an underrated actor. He showed range and it was satisfyingly entertaining this movie is all but boring, it's a fun action/adventure, dark fantasy, lite horror movie. Because of this I'm giving a 10/10. Yes I'm being way too generous, this movie deserved more (appreciation, reception) and overall it deserved more but due to its face paced but it's perfect direction, stylization, action sequences and overall captivating atmosphere, beautiful visuals and Luke Evans. This movie is worth watching, it's by any means no Oscar winning picture but another fine and entertaining Universal stand alone picture.",Dracula Untold

Dracula Untold is the first film in Universal Studios' attempt to reboot its classic Monsters franchises (Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolfman, etc). This vampiric tale presents a lot of interesting ideas, but it never comes completely together and ultimately falls flat.Prince Vlad (Luke Evans, The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug) essentially sells his soul to gain the power to destroy an entire army single-handed. However, he will be forever cursed unless he can go without feeding on human blood for three days, in which case he will return to his mortal form and lose his powers. The wind is taken out of most of the action sequence's sails slightly because the audience knows that Dracula is, for all intents and purposes, invincible. ""Whether Dracula can arrive in time to stop the villains"" isn't enough to keep the action sequences (and the rest of the film) from being rather dull.Considering what he was given to work with, Luke Evans shines in one of his first leading roles. His portrayal as the man-who-would-be Dracula is sympathetic, dramatic, and aggressive when needed. There's potential for some excellent inner turmoil that would be a piece of cake for Evans to bring to life, but most of the struggles that Vlad should be going through (resisting the craving for human blood, choosing between his newfound powers and his soul, trying not to return to his barbaric past life) are mostly suffered without the audience's knowledge. Dracula Untold tries way too hard to make Vlad a ""good guy"" who is always in control and only gives in to his inner monster when the time is right. The supporting cast is mostly one-dimensional, but the brief appearance of the legendary Charles Dance (Game of Thrones), who plays an unnamed vampire who grants Vlad the power to destroy armies, is definitely a standout.Dracula Untold's sets, special effects, and landscapes are all on par with the best of Hollywood's sweeping epics. This makes the film nice to look at, but poor storytelling and a few very obvious plot holes will keep viewers from being totally invested, unless they checked their brains at the door beforehand. What would've otherwise been a passable dark fantasy/action film takes a monumental tumble right at the finish line, courtesy of a painful, tacked-on epilogue that only serves to set up a potential sequel, completely disconnecting the entire film from Bram Stoker's classic in the process.This retelling of Dracula might have been better left Untold. 5/10",Dracula Untold

267,magedrifter,Dracula... A Fresh Take,10,28 January 2019,"A fresh take on a terrifying figure known as Vlad the Impaler. What this film manages to do is give heart and a reason for Vlad becoming Dracula. Originally meant to be the start of the dark universe (now cancelled) Dracula Untold tells a story of love, tragedy, loss, revenge and it does it so brilliantly well. Everything from the cast and writing was on point. Luke Evans plays the titular character well and gives a much lesser dark tone than the original Bram Stoker version of Vlad, in here he's simply known as Vlad the Redeemer. The Special effects in this film were gorgeous, and being a PG 13 rated film left it rather bloodless but doesn't take anything away from the film at all. This is a highly underrated film imo and I'd recommend movie buffs go see this movie at least once, it is truly a work of art :) the ending scene alone is worth revisiting as it hinted at a possible sequel that would have been an interesting set up if it were continued (sadly it doesn't look like it'll happen)""Men do not fear swords.

No one argues how formidable a warrior Mehmet was, but creation of barbaric soldiers by prolonged torturing of captured youths from enemy territories, where the hell did it come from? Perhaps from the concept of creation of Orcs from Elfs in LOTR. And then trying to show the Muslim Turks' torture and training had originally turned young Vlad into ""The Impaler"", that's utterly disgusting.In all honesty, I don't see much difference between creators of this type of movies and radical Muslim clerics who preach hate.

I waited so long for this movie to come out. I always wanted to see Luke Evans as Dracula. Since i saw his performance in F&F6 and No one lives. The Plot has some really nice twists if you know the story about the real Vlad Dracula. The Story starts with some quick explaining of who vlad his and what he did so far. Vlad and a few of his soldiers are exploring a cave and get attacked by something, you can guess what attacks them ;P Vlad retruns to Castle Dracula and the Monk explains him that in the Mountain there lives an ancient Vampire. We get to know Vlads Family and the Movie cuts to a Party of Vlad. Sadly it gets interrupted by Hamza Bay i think his name was(Turks) The Sultan Mehemed the 2nd requieres 1000 Boys or 100 i don't remember for his Jannissaries Corp and he also wants his son. Hamza tells Vlad he has to do as the sultan commands cause Vlad is defense less. The Day comes when Vlad has to bring his son to the turks but at the last moment he decides to kill the turks and save his son. Now War will be at his Door. Vlad decides to seek out the vampire so he can give him strenght to defeat the Turks. The master Vampire explains Vlad that if he can resist drinking human blood for 3 days he will become human again if not he will be damned for ever. The Rest you should better watch for yourself The Movie is shot beautifully and the locations look awesome even if it has some CGI in it. The most thing i liked was Vlads Armor with the Dragon on it. So you are a die Hard Dracula fan and watched almost every Drac movie outthere and you are fascinated about Vlad Dracula The Impaler you should watch this Movie ASAP. I don't know why this Movie gets so much hate. PS. give me a sequel anytime but only if Luke evans plays Dracula again:DSorry for my bad English and have fun with Dracula Untold",Dracula Untold
271,ModelOmega,Finally a Vampire film that gives Vampires justice (mostly).,7,8 October 2014,"So I was able to see ""Dracula Untold"" in theatres today thanks to a contest from Universal Canada, and I'm here to tell you that the movie was honestly much better then I expected.The plot concerns Luke Evans as Vlad Tepes, who was taken from his home in Wallachia as a young lad along with 999 boys to be brutally trained as a Turkish Janissary. He emerges as a brutal warrior, ""Vlad the Impaler"" but when his tenure with the Turks is done he returns to Transylvania to rule, throwing away or sealing up his nightmarish past and attempting to live a somewhat normal life with wife Mirena played by Sarah Gadot and son Ingeras played by Art Parkinson.Ten years later he is visited by Turkish emissaries that demand another 1000 boys, plus his son, Vlad appeals to the Sultan Medmed II played by Dominic Cooper, but he refuses to say no and Vlad retaliates by killing the officials sent to collect his son. Vlad knows his bastion cannot defeat the Turks head on, so he heads to a cave that apparently contains a Vampire, to see if he can utilize their dark arts to save his family and homeland.It's overall nicely done with a strong central performance by Evans, but don't be fooled by the name or trailers, this isn't a horror or horror-action films, it's a fantasy epic about the lengths one goes to in order to save what he loves, trying not to lose himself in the process. The choreography is overall good but it likes to bust out a bit of shaky cam for some early action, but for the final act you get great view-shots of Vampiric warfare and one jaw-dropping scene of what I could only describe as ""Bat-Bending"" By the way if you were ever waiting for it, this is the movie that decides to give Vampires some real meaning. All of their historic abilities and weaknesses are truthfully represented, super-human feats, rapid-healing, light-intolerance and vulnerability to silver, holy objects and the stake through the heart (but then again, what wouldn't that kill?). And the action scenes with Vampire Vlad are AWESOME, and the final act is the stuff of monster movie dreams, there are rumours the this is actually the start of an Avengers style monster mash-up by Universal, and if that's the case hell I'm exited to see where they go given the ending.If I have to give one glaring critique, it's the PG-13 rating, which means basically no blood splatter, which feels so wrong for a Vampire movie. But you can obviously tell the movie was fighting against it, and I'm going to assume the filmmakers were really intent on an R but were forced by the executives to go for appeal.Final Rating: 7/10, it doesn't re-write the monster movie, but Untold is a cracking good epic with surprisingly heartfelt drama, great stage design, effects and action, if a little ""dry"" for starring a monster that literally consumes blood.",Dracula Untold
272,tbk83,"Good, but could have been great...",6,7 October 2014,"While this is unlikely to be anyones movie of the year, it's far better than some reviews suggest. Whether or not it disappoints depends, as always, on what you expect. From the trailer it looked like it could have been an epic, tragic fantasy-war-movie. It turns out to be mostly an action flick.Almost everything that's there is good, but it's mostly CGI-action. None of the relationships are really explored, the villains aren't very threatening and Dracula isn't that tragic or creepy. The action, music, acting, cinematography, effects, editing, etc are all good enough to entertain, but the movie is far too short to tell the story with any kind of gravity. An extended cut could easily fix all that, but I doubt a lot of material was left out. This is an origin story,to there is room for a sequel (or midquel, since there is a time skip). I wouldn't say no to that.",Dracula Untold
273,Vector18,A pleasant surprise,8,27 April 2020,"For some reason, I expected a mediocre, happy ending, fantasy and after 10 minutes I thought I had the movie and the plot all figured out. But I didn't, and I'm glad that I was wrong because it was far better than I believed it would be.Luke Evans really sold his role to me, the story of him making a ""deal with the devil"" to save his family and his people was strong and compelling. The way things turn out for him, the fact that he had to kill his wife to save their son and having to become a ""monster"" for ever, makes the movie and his character even better.The way it ended I really hoped the story would continue especially since it did quite well at the box office but six years later it seems it won't.",Dracula Untold

Well for the action, you will be disappointed, by the amount of useless talks and even after all the talks that they had, they still didn't manage to develop any of the characters except Dracula himself. The story didn't make any sense, the movie is way to short, it feels rushed and last but not least, at the end you just feel that you watched a very expensive pilot for a new TV series. About the horror you can forget about it (thanks to the PG13 rating). For the good parts : The few actions scenes are actually impressive even if you saw most of it in the trailer. And I liked Luke Evans he did a good job with what they gave him to work with .",Dracula Untold

It is also about love, loyalty, war and peace, faith, power and human nature in general.An original and fresh approach, away from the paved paths, make this a one of a kind Dracula film.Some people rate this movie very low because they consider it to be historically inaccurate. Come on, are there any accurate movies about vampires?Also, some people rate this movie very low because they view it as islamophobic. That is impossible, because as I mentioned before, it is also about war and war is never wrong or right.Just watch it with an open mind and you won't be disappointed.",Dracula Untold

279,annalevit,Entertaining,6,21 December 2014,"It doesn't pretend to be historical fiction, so I don't understand people dissing it for not being true to history. Vampires are not exactly historical, are they, now? It does not pretend to follow the literary source - Bram Stoker's famous novel - either. It is a free-form fantasy about how Dracula the vampire could have started. Though the main reason to watch that story is to watch Luke Evans. If you are not a fan, feel free to skip the movie, although it is only 90 minutes and the pace is brisk. It's not really logical within itself either, but it does have interesting fighting scenes, somewhat clichéd family scenes, and it has Luke Evans looking very hot and Charles Dance playing the coolest vampire in decades - cool because it is intelligent, not because it sparkles. I enjoyed it, because I knew what to expect. If someone came into it looking for a serious look at the history of Vlad III, then they better leave after the first few minutes.",Dracula Untold
280,darthfusion,Absolutely FANtastic,9,18 October 2014,"I have been a huge fan of Dracula since reading the book as a teen and yet I have never seen a movie do the lore justice.Everything about this movie is fantastic.It's believable, that Luke Evans could evolve to be the Dracula we know and love. His reasoning behind his actions add depth to the character.The romantic aspect just adds to the story, and the way it wraps adds an extra layer to a very important character in the mythos.The ending of the movie *perfectly* sets the stage for what should be an epic trilogy.If you like Dracula, and or the Traditional Vampire lore, watch this movie.",Dracula Untold
281,zeabourne,Better than expected,8,27 December 2014,"As a vampire fan since forever I am usually disappointed at the various portrayals that appear from time to time. Either the characters can't be taken seriously or the plot is too far out. I laughed at Twilight and could not endure 10 minutes of the Vampire Diaries series. Without too much comparison, this movie is good for those who liked ""Interview with a Vampire"" as well as ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (the one with Gary Oldman) It's not as sophisticated and there may be some historical errors here, but unless you actually believe in vampires you can surely live with that. The acting is good, the plot is okay, and the absence of ""funny"" jokes ensures a dark ambiance throughout the movie. I'd say it's well worth your while. Enjoy!",Dracula Untold

If you are looking for a thriller/horror, this is not the movie for you.Actor casting was superb, the acting was fantastic, the story didn't delve too far into fantasy to put it out of beliefs grasp. And the special effects were second to none. There was not one moment of this movie I didn't enjoy, it was action meets story telling done absolutely right in every way.

If you like the epic heroic-fantasy movies this will be really good! I can see this as a treat for Peter Jackson fans, I was expecting yet another ""Dracula"", another version just like the others before it. It could be that my expectations were low, but I can say WOW!, I was so impressed by the production, as good as Lord of The Rings or The Hobbit series. Really good, a true epic story. As for the script, it is quite good, do not expect by any means to find any related historical research in it! It is purely a tale about a man and his love for his country, his family and the courage to fight for them even if it means the supreme sacrifice. You will find love in it, some gory scenes (it is about Dracula anyway), a lot of epic battle scenes and some other things you need to discover for yourself.

284,kschramreed,Unexpected entertainment!,7,22 January 2021,"Edit: This movie is NOT a 9 or 10, but it is most certainly NOT a 4 or below, as many have implied.I'll keep this brief. I saw the title and had exactly no expectations, not seen a trailer or read anymore than the film description on Netflix.Stunning CGI, filmography is superb with very interesting fight scenes and display of vampire power.
Acting was surprisingly good, and an absolute joy to see Charles Dance, which was unexpected. Luke Evans portrayed the role of Dracula very well.
Script was decent as well as the over arching story. The end felt a bit rushed - it could have done with an extra 15 minutes to set up the final fight.It's a different take to Dracula, which I don't mind at all. Will it win any awards? Perhaps not, but overall it was a good bit of entertainment, and I would recommend it to anyone who has a couple hours to spare.Well deserved 7/10!edit: This movie is NOT a 9 or 10, but it is most certainly NOT a 4 or below.",Dracula Untold
285,jacob-grant101,A Damn-Fine Fantasy Action Film,8,30 April 2015,"I've really taken a liking to Luke Evans. I've very much enjoyed his performances in other films of recent years, and once again he fails to disappoint. Dracula Untold is a fictional take on the story of Vlad the Impaler, as he defended his people from the Turkish invasion. The Turkish in this film are painted as pretty much wholly evil, which I'm sure has offended a few people, but they work as an evil enemy meant to strengthen Vlad's position as the hero. The Turkish storm into Vlad's castle dining hall, and demand one thousand boys for the sultan Mehmed's (Dominic Cooper) army in addition to the regular tribute, and Vlad's own son is included in this demand. When Vlad presents his son to a group of Turkish soldiers in a field, he instead slays them and begins his climb up the mountain to the cave of the vampire (Charles Dance). After the change, Vlad gains incredible power, and is able to annihilate hundreds of soldiers on the battlefield within a few minutes. His power comes at great cost, as he struggles to hide what he has become from his people and his family, as well as resisting the thirst for blood (he is told that if he resists feeding for three days, he will revert back to being human), and therefore must defeat the Turks within that time.Luke Evans has a very commanding presence on screen, and it really shows in this film. It is quite satisfying to watch Vlad unleash his wrath upon his enemies, as well as the emotion that Evans brings to the character. The plot is fairly straight forward, but it's the stylish action sequences and the strong performances that carry the film. This film will not teach you about history, nor will it leave you having to really think about what happened. It is however, a very fun ride. I recommend this film to anyone who loves stylish action, especially in a fantasy setting. if you enjoy Evans' other films, chances are good you'll enjoy this one too. I give this film an 8/10.",Dracula Untold
286,cindysbr,Looked like a very inferior knockoff,5,15 October 2014,"Looked very forward to this movie as the titular character is supposed to be the baddest a$$ villain out there short of Lucifer. Left the movie not awed by Vlad at all, not even close. Vlad the Impaler was supposed to be most feared and ruthless in his time, yet in this movie the lowest subject in his realm stood up to him (during the mob scene) without a quiver on the lip. The enemy's emissary talks down to him. The enemy's foot soldiers don't even stand back or look away in his presence. One would leave ""The Devil wears Prada"" with more dread and fear of Meryl Streep that our guy here! I get that they spun the story to make Vlad more peace-loving and remorseful after he retired from fighting and 10 years after... but this side was overdone and made him appear truly weak, vulnerable and inconsequential and didn't effectively impart to the audience of the ruthlessness that simmered within. With the impaled victims' silhouettes taken out, this could be a family film. Right down to formulaic scene on the last part where Vlad meets the enemy's top dog. Silver as kryptonite to even things out? Gimme a break. And how did the guy know a wooden stake would do the trick when vampires were hardly known then and their existence was supposed to be lore and secret. Loyal followers of Bram Stoker's version of the legend of Vlad are fairly warned of watching this very inferior twist. Quite disappointed but 5 stars for effort.",Dracula Untold
287,MsWannare,An amazing remake of Dracula!,10,17 June 2017,"True, its loosely based on Vlad The Impaler, but Luke Evans and the story thanks to the incredible writers will have you rooting for Dracula. And if that is not enough, the special effects are flawless and filled with plenty of action, packed into a beautiful package. Considering the fact that Vlad was the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula, I have to say that this story which is closer to the real events in history (Minus the blood sucking vampire part) is a much more entertaining experience as the Bram Stoker version has been done and re-done multiple times. Quite honestly I am ecstatic that i didn't see a face with excessive foundation to give it that pale-vamp-twilight look!Its a shame that this was a big box office hit, considering all the trash that climbs over the Billion dollar returns these days. I really hope they come out with a sequel to this soon. My Review is a perfect 10/10",Dracula Untold

It's not Oscar material (I don't like to wasting $$ on touchy feely movies you can watch at home)and that Oscar crap depresses me anyway. There's something so satisfying about watching a fairy tale with lots of action and killing. It's not long-winded like the Batman movies and Luke Evans is amazing. My only gripe is there's not enough violence or gore or horror-elements. There are many things they could have done better with this movie but oh well, I was nevertheless thoroughly entertained.

293,mada-soare93,I want a sequel,8,3 October 2014,"If you look at this for your history exam, this is about as accurate as 300, if my history class is anything to go by. They actually went as far as to say that he ruled Transilvania instead of Wallachia - and I couldn't find it in me to be put off. On the other hand, if you look at it for what it should have marketed itself to be - an origin story - you get a completely different picture: The leads carry the whole story, one valiant effort to leave playing second fiddle for younger guys, the fight scenes are original, which is depressingly rare nowadays, the soundtrack is nigh nonexistent, and all the better for it, and the effects are used sparsely and ridiculously and appear all the more grossly self-indulgent for it (I loved *all* the bats).Also: Gollum and Jack Sparrow's love child makes an appearance. What a face to come back to life to... (no CPR, people, stay calm)Bottom line: if Man of Steel is getting a sequel because Terminator's third cousin once removed already planted his unmovable mug in the Justice League universe (and weirder still, some paid to see it), then Universal should definitely nurture a series that was *actually* entertaining.",Dracula Untold
294,kylejjaustin,"A dark and gritty origin story of how Vlad the Impaler became Dracula; however, there could have been a bit more to sink your teeth into.",8,23 October 2014,"Directed by newcomer Gary Shore and starring Luke Evans, Sarah Gadon, Dominic Cooper and Charles Dance, Dracula Untold tells the story of Prince Vlad of Transylvania and his transformation into that most recognizable of monsters, Count Dracula. The events are set in motion when the Sultan of Turkey (Dominic Cooper) requests one thousand boys for his imperial army, including Vlad's son. After an unsuccessful negotiation with the Sultan, Prince Vlad makes a vow to his beloved wife (Sarah Gadon) to protect his family. To defend his country, he then turns to the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) who haunts the caves of Transylvania. The Prince bargains with the Master Vampire to become a vampire himself. The movie then takes a fairytale turn in which Vlad must resist the urge to drink human blood for the next three days. Upon his transformation he is reborn as a one-man supernatural force of darkness, ready to singlehandedly take on the Sultan's army and defend his family and Transylvania.Luke Evans in the title role gives a brooding yet decent performance, though I did want more character development and not just from the leading role, but also from the rest of an undistinguished cast including the Sultan's portrayal as a one- dimensional villain. On the other hand, Charles Dance, best known for Game of Thrones, gives a classically sinister performance as the Master Vampire and is the best in the movie.Like Disney's recent retelling of the Sleeping Beauty story, Meleficant, the film is centered on a classic villainous character. Dracula Untold takes a similar direction and loosely bases Prince Vlad's dark past on the historical account of the real Vlad the Impaler. When I first heard about this movie being pitched as the origin story of Dracula, I was intrigued. The story delivered on what I anticipated and it didn't disappoint. It really makes for an interesting blend of legend and history, though I was not fully convinced a character that went from a bloodthirsty murderer to a demonic creature would make a likable hero. The story's direction later on feels more like a modern superhero film rather than Dracula's story as traditionally known.The film's Transylvanian setting is dark as it should be and is also reminiscent of Game of Thrones. The battle scenes are epic and fast paced but rely too heavily on shaky cam. Ironically, for a vampire movie, there's not a lot of blood; obviously to achieve its PG-13 rating. Despite the movie's lack of character development and a predictable plot, I still recommend it to fans of both the horror and fantasy genres. The ending is left open – sequel perhaps? I've heard Universal Pictures is renewing its licensing of other classic monsters such as Frankenstein, The Mummy and the Wolfman. Sounds like an epic monster mash is on the horizon.",Dracula Untold
295,pongowongo-466-306559,Expectations are everything,7,20 November 2014,"This movie is a 7.5 at best. The main problems with the movie are small sequence holes in the timeline, and unnecessary finale, and lack of full development. That being said, what did people expect? Did no one see the trailer or read the title? Did no one look at the PG 13 rating? Historically accurate? No. Frightening horror? No. PG 13 remember? Perfect character and story development? No.This movie is a cool movie loosely based on Bram Stoker's Dracula and some notion of historical events. Hence the title ""untold"". It's not some great work of film, story or art. It's just a movie with low aspirations. Most people knew this when they went to see it and enjoyed it as such.If you want to see a PG 13 film based on the character Dracula in his native Transylvania that reflects on some loose historical events, then watch this film and have fun with it. It shows the powers of darkness, cool action sequences, some decent acting and drama, but does not go overboard with anything. It's just a fun cool film, relax people, if you want to see a Dracula Masterpiece, Watch Coppalas interpretation made in 1992. If you want a real classic see Christopher lee in The Blood of Dracula. If you to sit down and watch a Friday night movie with your family or by yourself, watch Dracula Untold and don't complain about historical inaccuracy or small holes in the story.",Dracula Untold

Producer Alissa Phillips said that it is part of things and that Luke Evans will be playing Dracula in future installments of the franchise.With that out of the way.........All goods things to say here! Great story! Great acting! Great writing! A new take on the story that did have a new twist but it made sense to make it that way. It wasn't thrown in there to give it some cheesy way of connecting things with no reason behind it.The Gothic look was amazing! Sets were great!

Very much like Eben Olson (Josh Hartnett) in 30 Days Of Night (2007) does what he does at the end to save his wife and townspeople.It is well acted, well casted and really well acted, the British cast is just amazing with the likes of Charles Dance, Luke Evans, Dominic Cooper, Ferdinand Kingsley and also Paul Kaye, all did an amazing job!The special effects are quite OTT, the film is full of it and if you are looking for something historically accurate then don't expect anything from this film. It is just a retelling for entertainment purposes and the characters are really strongly portrayed.I do recommend it, it was better than Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter film and one of the better vampire films of the recent years since the whole Twishite craze!!",Dracula Untold
299,markhiwater,Dracula: Hero or Monster?,10,25 October 2014,"Dracula Untold seeks an innocent protector of innocent people. As if there is such a thing? The double sided coin of protecting his home kingdom is foreshadowed when Vlad Dracul (Luke Evans) believes the good side of his name meaning, ""Protector of the innocent."" The double entendre of his name means, ""Son of the Devil."" The dialogue delicately tells, ""Sometimes the world doesn't need another hero, sometimes what it needs is a monster."" People vote and pray for a hero yet condemn a savior who fights their monsters. We are shown what can make a soldier perform atrocities with their conscience turned to ""off"". In particular, Vlad was abandoned by his own country and sent to the Turks as tribute. When Transylvania shipped youth to the Turks to serve as soldiers. The Turks trained the boys with horrific brain-washing in a foreign language; heaping isolation and abuse in order to transform the innocent into capable soldier-slaves of the Turks. Vlad Dracula returned from the Turks and became king and his subjects adored him. Vlad's pheasants ignored his history of war crimes. Notwithstanding blame, Dracula's war crimes were to save a community that would eventually condemn him through fear. When the Turks demanded Vlad's son, Vlad's cowardly villagers feign ignorance of warfare and offered silver to buy-off the vulgar Turks. Vlad learned evil can never be bought off or bribed away. Instead, later in the film the silver money was used to perpetuate the Turks savagery. This loss-loss predicament drove Vlad to offer himself to a vampire and gained the power to defend his kingdom. In the end, the noble Dracula has a breaking point, found when he drinks his wife's blood as she dies. Even in this extreme circumstance, with no right way out, Vlad did what was required and imbibes on a hopeless path of self- destruction. He retrieves his family's armor from a monastery. Dracula's family Dragon armor was kept in a monastery, under the watchful eye of the Church. Instead of destroying the armor, the Church apparently had a double standard and preferred to keep evil close to it's chest. The Church kept the Dragon Armor preserved for future horrific times. The Church, represented by Brother Lucian (Paul Kaye) believes it controls vampires by the power of the cross and a silver sword. Brother Lucian and the villagers initially tried to burn and kill Vlad in his vampire-thrall stage. When the village is unable to kill the tainted Vlad, the village allows Vlad to defend the monastery. He is condemned as if a sacrifice to appease the demons of violence. Vlad did the violence required and the society he protects went blameless. Later in the film, in the tragic horror of the looted and destroyed monastery, Vlad converts surviving villagers to Vampire- thralls. Vlad soon sees that death and destruction will never be satiated. Even the God-fearing villagers hold the desire and ability to become ravaging monsters and kill every last member of the Turk's army.Riveting story telling showed Vlad fighting Mehmed, the invading Turk leader (Dominic Cooper) on a pile of silver coins. They were the same silver coins Vlad used to pay the Turks to placate their evil. The same silver was used to bring Vlad to the point of near-defeat. This irony of silver is one of many morals told in the film.When the pious do-gooders among the village become vampires, their savage rage is less tempered with ethics and morals than Vlad ever was. No wonder the villagers tried to kill Vlad. It is as if their previous attempt to kill Vlad was to keep hidden away their own vices and lust for bloodshed. The villagers sensed the evil in their own hearts could never survive temptation of power and blood-lust. The cinematography fluctuates with the mood in the film. It gives us a change in the grain and color as a reminder of bygone era cinematics. The intermittent sense of nostalgia bids us to recall fantasy monster films where good and bad is as clear as black and white. At other times, the images are so clear it is as if we are being shown the other side of a twisted moral dilemma. Special effects were outstanding. The director, Gary Shore used an epic, portrait-perfect still-motion sculpture-like depiction of the brutality of the war training of Vlad as a boy. The origins of loss of humanity is riveted in the viewer's mind as if it is a fulcrum on which relativity of morality is hinged.",Dracula Untold
300,psychorancho,I personally enjoyed it,9,11 October 2014,"I can kind of see why it got hate...I mean it wasn't THAT good it wasn't amazing but in my opinion I enjoyed it and I found it fun to watch so I will give it a good rating. It says ""strong horror"" but really it's just a few jump scares here and then. I recommend trying it out because it is fun to watch. This isn't one of those ""sparkling teenage unemotional"" vampire films, this film is violent, bloody and entertaining. It has a low meta-score but I suppose each to their own..I enjoyed it and I would definitely watch again if not buy it.

302,cambodimerican24,Very solid and entertaining retelling of Vlad the Impaler aka Dracula ;),7,21 May 2016,"***May contain spoilers***This was a very solid and entertaining film. If you are coming into this film thinking about historical accuracy and so on about the real Vlad then this might not be for you lol. Been a while since I've been compelled enough to write an actual review on here since I've mostly been sporadic with just rating films without a review on the message boards however, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Solid performances by the main characters and the plot was smooth. Character development was just right and the ending left me wanting more which I hope they do. The CGI and special effects were great which definitely gave a unique and stylish rendition of Vlad's ""vampiric"" abilities. This rendition of the classic Dracula mythos has a fresh and very welcoming style and life to it because of the smooth pacing of the sequences and overall solid character performances. This is a first debut for the director and I think he did a good job. A sequel and follow up would be nice. It's just too bad that it was canned by rotten tomatoes and received mixed reviews from the audience and not sure if it made out in the box office however I hear that it sold well on DVD/Blu-Ray release so yeah crossing my fingers haha. I highly recommend this film for those who every now and then want a fill of the vampire ethos. A solid 7/10 stars.",Dracula Untold

305,nathanfreve,AN ACTION PACKED HORROR EXPERIENCE!,7,2 May 2021,"Is Dracula Untold the best vampire movie? No it's not. Should you watch it with the expectation of the original Dracula? No you shouldn't.However, the movie on its own is really exciting and interesting. I liked this movie a lot and found it to be very entertaining with a good balance of action but not being overly gory. Don't expect this to be like the classic chiller or you be very disappointed. I found it to have a good story line and really awesome action sequences. I recommend watching it, but just watch it for what it is and try not to compare, it's its own new story, not a carbon copy of the old story.",Dracula Untold
306,trinigeleon,Enjoyable for what it is,7,24 November 2014,"When I first saw Dracula Untold advertised a few months ago I thought, ""Here we go, yet another 'Dracula' to re-hash all the usual tripe once more."" More recently, I happened across an interview with Luke Evans (Vlad) wherein he made a point of explaining that this was much more than just your typical monster-movie. There was a romantic back story which would explain Dracula's origin and motivations. This got my interest.Having now seen the film I have to admit that I very much enjoyed this telling of a classic genre.Now, before I go further, I have a small confession to make. I have a habit of watching a movie and then jumping onto the IMDb reviews to see if the consensus of opinion is in line with my own. Generally, I am in agreement with the overall ratings, if not the specifics of individual reviewers. In this case, and for the first time, I feel compelled to write a review due to the sheer amount of negativity in the review section. As such, I am going to address one of the main reoccurring negative points to get it out of the way.""The time line/location is historically inaccurate."" This may very well be true. However, at no point does this movie make any claim to be a historically accurate story. It is a movie about Vampires. So far as I am aware Vampires are not factual, physical beings, historically or otherwise. Perhaps what I admire most about this movie is the fact that it avoids the typical 'the-village-is-being- attacked-by-mythological-creatures-who-have-suddenly-appeared- despite-being-immortal-and-oooh-look-its-a-hero!' version of this story. If to achieve this the story has to borrow aspects from reality in order to weave a new narrative then I am all for it. The fact that this point has irritated so many people is simply beyond me. Why have these same reviewers who are so irked by these inaccuracies remained quiet about certain other movies (I'm looking at you, Braveheart) which are actually based on historical fact?As I've alluded to this movie deals with the back story and motivations of how Dracula came to be. Without revealing any plot details, I felt this was done in an interesting and believable manner. There is a humanity to all of Dracula's motivations for his actions throughout the movie. Actually, as I write this it occurs to me that maybe the reason for the negativity of some reviews is due to the fact that this version of the Dracula story doesn't depict Dracula as a straight forward villain, instead presenting believable motivations for his actions and his ultimate evolution into the Dracula that we are all more familiar with.Having said that, Dracula Untold is by no means a classic. While it does have some genuinely novel points in its approach to the character of Dracula it also has its allocated quantity of stereotypical cheese. Further, some of the secondary characters are given little if any development and the acting can be a little wooden at times (I cannot include Luke Evans in this category, I thought he was excellent). The running time was a little short at 90 minutes which didn't really allow for fuller exploration I feel this movie would have benefited from and there were a few moments which I felt were a little off in terms of continuity. Finally, there is one major plot point which, while beautifully shot, requires a significant suspension of dis-belief. To say that in a review of a vampire movie should indicate my level of annoyance while watching. Still, despite these drawbacks I have to say that I did enjoy this movie. All things considered I would give this movie a solid C+. To sum up: If you're a fan of the vampire genre, then this movie will appeal to you. If you're a fan of action/fight sequences, then this movie will appeal to you. If you're a fan of good CGI, then this movie will appeal to you. If you're open to exploring new interpretations of classic genres (Twilight excluded), then this movie will appeal to you. However, if you want your vampire movies to maintain historical accuracy then give this movie a wide berth.Peace, Love and all that Jazz :)",Dracula Untold
307,OLOLSouthPark,From one Dracula-fan to another...,3,8 March 2015,"This movie lacks pretty much everything. This is not what a Dracula-movie should be. There is no emotion, feeling or presence of a good storytelling. It is all so linear, so soulless. Don't get me started on the acting... Sometimes I thought to myself, this is just embarrassing. At times annoying!After having looked forward to this movie for a long time, I am deeply disappointed.If you're looking for the horror/romance story that is a good Dracula- movie, I will recommend looking elsewhere.This movie is, if not informed beforehand, a one-time see. After that, it's forgotten for ever. It's not a Dracula classic at all.",Dracula Untold
308,jolly_adam_roger,No need to shut your brain off.,9,15 October 2014,"Historical inaccuracy here is not an issue, because if the legend is to be believed, then the history books must be taken as grossly inaccurate. Using real names is a way of saying, ""this is how it ACTUALLY happened,"" at least as much as ANY horror movie has ever been ""inspired by true events."" Nobody is going to watch this film and take it as a history lesson, if anything it's an ""alternate history"" (which mind you IS A GENRE) lesson, and if they do take it seriously and fail a test because of it, then they're an idiot.Yes, the script is a bit bland, but this movie is also pretty short. It isn't so much about WHAT they say, it's about how they say it, and the acting from the main cast is EXCEPTIONAL.Realistically, this movie is about special effects, action, and Luke Evans shirtless, which it all does very well, but not in a ""shut your brain off"" sort of way. You won't leave the theater questioning the motives of any of the characters, but rather wondering where they're going to go from here. Honestly I hope this movie gets a sequel, or at least gets incorporated into the planned shared monster movie universe which Universal is planning, because what they've made may not be revolutionary, but it's far better than 90% of crap we get fed sequel after sequel. And my shoes and socks were soaked when I watched it.",Dracula Untold
309,CastorTroyOnCom,Everyone will enjoy this flick except history buffs,8,12 October 2014,"If your looking for a good action flick with a decent plot this is the movie for you. With a 90min runtime I was expecting this movie to feel ""rushed"", it felt far from that. The action was great, it did not disappoint with all the cool vampire abilities you see in the trailer, especially transforming into a group of bats. Being a Dracula movie there are things you have to expect, yes he receives his power by drinking blood, having all the vulnerabilities as every vampire (which they do very good in this movie) but the way this movie makes you root for Vlad(Dracula) you actually find yourself engulfed in the movie wanting him to overcome the darkness and win. However if you are a history buff and it irks you when movies take real life people and change their history for a movie, you will not enjoy this because it is loosely based off Vlad the Impaler.

310,bopgi,Dracula Untold 2?,10,14 May 2016,"Director Gary Shore has said he thinks there's so much history to explore in a sequel that he isn't quite sure where to start, but the idea would be to bridge the gap between the Vlad we encountered in Dracula Untold with the classic Dracula from Bram Stoker (tie in some other undead, like the walkers from Zombieland 2, and I'll be even MORE excited). Luke Evans is said to be pretty interested in a Dracula Untold sequel as well, saying he's been working hard for quite a while, and is happy to see the success his first film has enjoyed.Gary Shore directed the first film, and has expressed interest in returning for the sequel. Will he direct Dracula Untold 2? Not sure, but this is a franchise that I think you could treat the director as less than essential. Think Fast and Furious. Heck, Evans was IN one of those! Do you care who directs them? OF COURSE NOT! If you're seeing Fast and Furious movies, you likely aren't even aware that films aren't real. This isn't like the Big Hero 6 sequel, where you actually want the original team involved all the way.",Dracula Untold

How can you expect a historic movie with vampires ? don't you get a headache thinking on this?This movie combine (perfectly i might add) a historic figure with a legend and the superhero Hollywood trend.I must add that this movie is (as much as the superhero and legend script permitted) the most accurate movie ever made about Dracula, they actually named correctly some places (that exists and are historical correct) and the name of the characters, and the dragon order fact. But that's it!For those who wanted the same old story, read the title: Dracula UNTOLD - must i really translate what UNTOLD mean? it's a new story dhaaaa....Good movie with a new idea (i think it's the first medieval superhero ever made) good script, stunning effects and for sure the director or someone else has actually came to Transilvania (that is in Romania not Hungary like the Brawn Stoker said).I can't wait for the sequel!",Dracula Untold
312,Thrintus,I Draculiked it,7,4 October 2014,"I thought it was pretty good. Films like Twilight pretty much destroyed my interest in vampires, but gradually my interest came back by watching films like Daybreakers and Underworld. And with this, we're back on track.Casting: 8/10 At first, I thought Luke Evans wouldn't be too great as Dracula. And come to think of it, when he was talking to his men to encourage them, it almost felt like I was watching Bard the Bowsman talking to the residents of Lake-town. But once I got over that, I couldn't help but realize that he is a fantastic actor and that he certainly brought Vlad to life. The other actors are also well chosen, nothing out of the ordinary, but solid. Also fun to see Charles Dance in something else than Game of Thrones, although I must say I didn't recognize him at first (you'll see what I mean). Overall, casting is great.Music: 9/10 The soundtrack was absolutely fantastic. I mean, what else would you expect if virtuoso Ramin Djawadi (Iron Man, Pacific Rim, Prison Break, Game of Thrones, Person of Interest and even video games like Medal of Honor: Warfighter and Shift 2: Unleashed) created it? He's the Iranian version of Hans Zimmer. It's worth watching the credits for solely the music. Speaking of credits, there's nothing after them. So unless you want to enjoy the music, like I did, there's no reason to stay.Plot: 6/10 Although the premise was good, the plot in this film feels absolutely rushed. The fact that the film has around 85 minutes of playtime, without credits, doesn't really help either. Some lore and some history about the Turks and their feud with the Transsylvanians would have been nice. In the intro, you get a brief explanation but it felt really cheesy to me. If the movie would have been an hour longer, they could've certainly let the characters develop more, let the plot naturally unwrap without forcing it to unfold, have Vlad practice with his powers more (he seems to have mastered them only 5 minutes after gaining them) and so on. This was kind of a let-down. However, if you bear all this in mind, you might enjoy it more than I did. Don't expect too much of the plot.Visuals: 10/10 Well, I can't really add much more to this other than that this film has absolutely amazing visuals. The more the movie progresses, the more you will notice this. Sometimes it does get a little ""overvisualized"", but that didn't really bother me. Especially not after having seen ""The Desolation of Smaug"".Script: 7/10 The dialogues were rather, 'meh', if you catch my drift. Sometimes there's so much cheese involved that you think you're having a French dish with wine and bread. It's not bad, it's just.. very predictable and sometimes laughably funny. But it's never THAT sub- mediocre that you feel embarrassed for watching it. Let's just conclude that it could have been much better.Overall, the music and the fast-paced, beautifully visualized action really make this movie worth the watch. Lower your expectations a tad and enjoy it for what it is. That's what COUNTs.",Dracula Untold
313,danieleriktheodorlundin,Entertainment :),9,1 February 2015,"This movie is supposed to be entertaining, and because it succeeded in that regard as far as I am concerned, it's a very good movie. This is the kind of movie you should watch with a glass of beer in your hand. Enjoy the story for what it is and drink your beer. If you approach this movie with an analytic mind, you're probably not going to enjoy it. The plot's got more holes in it than a Swiss cheese and it shouldn't be treated as a deep, psychological study of the human mind.Who the heck has the patience for that? Just enjoy it on a basic, emotional level and I'm sure you'll have a good time.Enjoy!",Dracula Untold
314,jgshark21,"Very Underrated, Thoroughly Enjoyable",9,13 October 2014,"From what I've seen on here, many people seem to dislike this movie. Most users seem to make note of the short length (90 mins.), the historical flaws, and the lack of plot.Most reviews point out the length, which at a run-time of only 90 minutes, is completely understandable. However, length does not make a movie. Most older movies were an hour and a half, tops. Now, most movies run at 2.5, if not, 3 hrs. Yes, making the movie longer could've made it much better, but as I've seen in many movies, it can also kill the pace and seem to drag on forever. I wish it would've been longer for more character development and emotional investment, but I am glad they ended it at 90 minutes, as opposed to dragging something on. For me, if I were rating the length only, I would give it a 7/10.Another flaw that seemed to be over-emphasized by reviewers was the historical inconsistencies. Although these may be true, people need to realize that this is a Hollywood movie. Hollywood, thankfully, does not make National Geographic. So, I'm baffled that people expect it to be historically accurate, especially considering the fact that this is indeed, about Dracula, who never existed. Judging on completely historical consistency, I would rate this 10/10, because there is simply nothing historically accurate about Dracula in the first place, so how could we possibly claim that it isn't historically accurate?The final issue people seemed to have with this movie was with the plot. Even though the plot seemed to be pathetic to some, most of it was due to the short length of the film. Battle scenes were too short to truly grasp the importance and intensity of them. The CGI was amazing, and I don't know what they could've done better in that category. Still, the major problem with the film is the short length. Making it longer would've added more character development, plot clarity, longer battles, and more time to enjoy the movie. With all of this considered, I would have to rate the plot a 8/10, because of the wonderful twist they made on the original story, and the potential of a great story.With everything taken into account, I would rate this movie a 9/10, because of the intriguing story, wonderful CGI, intense scenes, quick pace, and overall, it's a good movie.",Dracula Untold

317,Definition_of_insanity,"""Salvation lies in the dark and all it's power.""",7,10 October 2014,"Finally a vampire movie with a vampire that doesn't sparkle. The film starts out in the 15th century, and after ten years of peace and prosperity The Turks come into the kingdom of Prince Vlad(played by Luke Evans) and demand 1000 boys, including Vlad's own son, for The Sultan's army. Desperate to save his kingdom and his family, Vlad strikes a pact with The Master Vampire(played by Game of Thrones's Charles Dance) for,""the strength of 100 men and dominion over the night and all it's creatures."" Now Vlad must use these new powers to protects those he holds dear. While trying to maintain his humanity.This film is directed by newcomer Gary Shore. And he does a good job with his first film. His vision of Dracula's origins is the story of good man with a checkered past trying to do what's right. And he succeeds in that department. He is able to bring out the loving father and husband in Vlad's character. But also some of his darker tendencies. You do sympathize with Vlad and his conflict. A big part of that is definitely thanks to Luke Evans. He does a great job with this role. He makes a character nicknamed Vlad The Impaler likable. That should tell you how good he is in this movie. The other actors do a good job as well. Sarah Gadon is great in her role as Vlad's wife and Art Parkinson, while not having much to do, is also good in his role as Vlad's son. One of my other favorites in this film is Charles Dance. He reminds me a bit of the Emperor from Star Wars and you can tell the actor is having a ball with it. Dominic Cooper does well with what he's given.And that brings me to one of the issues with this film. Aside from Vlad and his family, none of the other characters are really fleshed out or developed. Sometimes people die and you go,""who was that again?"" Not only that, but some of the character's actions don't make a lot of sense. And knowing what we know about Dracula and this being his origin story, some of the elements are a bit predictable.Overall Dracula Untold is one entertaining movie, and not a bad origin story for the most iconic vampire ever put into any medium.",Dracula Untold
318,david-herz-901-38916,Unfairly reviewed by critics and some normal people,8,15 November 2014,"I do not understand the venomous reviews from critics and a few normal people. There's nothing wrong with this film and a good deal right. It has an original twist. That Vlad Tepes would become Vlad Dracul, son of the devil, to save his people from the Turks is a choice I have not often seen in vampire movies. There is a good deal of historical fact in the story, among other things that Vlad Tepes was given over by his father to the Sultan to guarantee the father's good behavior, and that this experience did not endear the Turks to Vlad. The actors speak Turkish, the camera is good, the acting is impeccable and the vampire tropes are used well. Of course it is Murnau's fault that vampires are destroyed by light since legend has it that they are not at their best but hardly holocausted by the sun's rays. I enjoyed the film, I would have given it a 7,5 but cannot so gave it an 8 in response to the misery of the reviews.",Dracula Untold
319,tschmauck,I am just disappointed because of what they did to Dracula's reputation...,5,5 November 2014,"To begin with what probably I would like to call a ""destructive criticism"" I would like to say that Luke Evans cannot be compared with the legend that Gary Oldman made, there is no point to compare. When I got my ticket to watch this film with my girlfriend, I was expecting something more like a 'Thriller' or a 'Horror Movie', but it did not even pass by my mind that we were just preparing our backs to sit down and be tortured by this film. Anyway I do not want to be that of a jerk just because is the debut of Gary Shore in the film industry.In addition I would like to say that when you hear the word ""Dracula"", you are not expecting an epic movie trying to make up what the legends say about the real Dracula, to be honest, who really cares about the real story? No one has the idea of how he was, so probably a lot of people did not really understand what was going on, and just a few people could understand it.The effects in general are poor and gives the impression that you are not in the 16th century, reminds me of the pathetic movie at the middle of this year 'I, Frankenstein', again a remake trying to desperately drain all the money as possible from a classic plot.I did not enjoy the movie at all and I almost felt asleep while watching it.",Dracula Untold

After having done so, I just absolutely must add in my own two cents. I never even had an account with this website before, until I wanted to write a review for Dracula Untold. With that said, a lot of the negative reviews will dwell on the fact that this movie wasn't true to history and while I don't know my history of Dracula very well, I believe that aside from straying away from original stories, this Dracula Untold does a fabulous job of building its own plot.I am already biased in that I am a very huge vampire fan; I even have all of the Twilight books. BUT I will be the first to say how horrible the Twilight movies are and because of them, I almost was skeptical about Dracula Untold. After watching it though, I must say that it was wonderful--the drama, the acting, the special effects, the storyline. And Luke Evans, my was he an incredible actor. I felt his pain, his struggle, but more so his kind heart and pure soul despite his ""deal with the devil"" supposedly. This movie builds around an intense love between him and his wife and we can see that this is also what connects us into what seems to be a sequel. Not only was I devastated at the fate of Vlad's wife towards the end but I was also overwhelmed when the very ending gave us an awesome twist. I could go on and on, but it's clear to see how emotionally invested I became even though it was only 1hr and a half. (I even cried, more than once!) This is undoubtedly one of my favorite vampire movies, if not my most favorite. Come to think of it, it certainly has become my most favorite vampire movie of all time, that is until the sequel comes.",Dracula Untold

The film is extremely entertaining as it is meant to be and not a lesson in mythology as some thinks it should have been and it does a very good job of entertaining. I am the type of person who watches a movie while doing something else (ie... if at home playing on the computer or tablet and in the theater generally thinking about things that need to be done elsewhere or fantasizing about hitting the person close to me playing with a cell phone, yes I see the irony but I'm not disturbing others when at home) generally but for this one I did not move or lose focus. The music, makeup and sound was very good and in character with the movie.

Vlad used VERY harsh methods himself to deter much larger Ottoman forces, and to this day, he is recognized by much of Europe for deterring the Ottoman slaughter of ""infidels"". Watch the movie for what it is, don't watch it for a historical documentary. Go to your library for that stuff, as I have. This is a good movie but not perfect. There's SO MUCH potentially, especially when combining the real Vlad with Stoker's myth, that you need an 8 hour mini-series to do it justice. Still, good movie.",Dracula Untold

Luke Evans is perfectly cast as Dracula. The movie is 90 minute so you wouldn't have everything 'spelled out'. It's reasonably fast paced; the movie has its flaws but minor enough that you can reasonably pass it; the only major flaw that I see and think the movie should work on explaining is how the Sultan knows about Dracula's weaknesses.

Can't you people just enjoy the movie, or simply close your eyes or walk out of the theatre if ""history"" bothers you so much? I enjoyed the movie as it is. The length of this movie is just perfect since there are no filler / unnecessary scenes. All minor details does not change how well this movie is done.Please stop comparing this movie to history. It is what it is. The movie cannot be undone.",Dracula Untold

331,rfrzen,Well idk about the novel but this looks more like...,8,15 November 2014,"Well after some wait i saw this movie . I am from tansylvania but i didn't got offended by the many history mistakes in this movie is a fiction after all . And after all history that is older then 150-200 years is not 100% accurate anyways ... if i was an famous writer and write something fictional now who knows if 500-1000 years in the future they might think its true :)Anyway like the title said , this movie did not had an Dracula (Bram Stoker) feel to it. But rather a Castlevania (video game) feel to it. I felt that the 1st time i saw Dracula take on an army in the movie and his powers , they looked more like Belmonts (Dracula in the Castlevania : Lords of shadow) powers , even the ""Master Vampire"" had an Zobek (one of Dracula's nemesis ) vibe . I know in 2009 Castlevania movie was canceled so i was glad to find something similar even tho i still hope for Castlevania movie in the future .The movie is not perfect at all it has a lot of bad scripting here and there , but it is enjoyable at least for me it was . My biggest issue with the movie is that except vlad/Dracula all the other characters are rly blend and insignificant (maybe the master vampire is an exception). He is so much powerful than any villain they could make up (without superpowers or wity like van helsing) that it feels like he is 0 danger and u have a hard time to be scared for him ever . Maybe in a sequel they can make the master vampire (btw Charles Dance is awesome )to be a true nemesis for him that could be rly interesting to see . But overall the movie did well enough to worth an sequel so we will see what happens with the story in the future .",Dracula Untold

338,silver_bolbo,What a Romanian Open Minded thinks about this movie which explores one iconic king of the Romanian people.,9,23 July 2015,"Hello folks !I've just seen the movie Dracula Untold , first of all I was prepared to see a movie about the historical Vlad Tepes (The Impaler) but what I have seen is a mix at about 9 to 1 SF with reality , what is true about this movie are the names which are Romanian or Turkish names.If you are open minded or at least a vampire movie fan you will really enjoy this movie .Me being Romanian and having the image of Vlad Tepes as a really good king who actually ruled in Valahia not in Transilvania by the way and saved our people from the ottomans(turks) many times using an army of 20 000 people against to 200 000 enemies (more or less) is an automatic action to think at history only when I hear his name ; but the fact is that his power was a myth that kept the enemies scared by his methods of punishing everyone, from the land or foreigner, many times impaling people for robberies at the entrance of the towns...With this in mind I would say that I enjoyed the movie as I said in the beginning it tries to add together SF and reality and had achieved more than other movies about Vlad Tepes Dracul , what I hope is that in the future a director will make a 90% historical movie I guarantee it would be better than Braveheart. PS The actors are really appropriate Luke Evans is really close to what Vlad The Impaler looked like and how he used to act , well done for that for the actor and the director!",Dracula Untold

It takes all the things we have heard or previously watch and remakes it in a new kind of way that I just love and enjoy. Also the actors are a plus, I just enjoy watching Luke Evans movies, He never lets me down, and Dominic Cooper Is just a Bonus.

Unlike other Dracula movies - more than horror this movie revolves around sacrifice, love and war. Dracula Untold is a story about the necessity of evil and Luke evans did a great job as protagonist. and the plot breath new life into the Dracula tale and vampire myth in general.The director, Gary Shore shows some nice visual touches given this is his debut full length movie – he made his name making highly acclaimed short films and has a bright future ahead of him.Though many reviewers argue about the plot not being in sync with history - If you just forget all this - you will love this movie.

Also, Dominic Cooper does a wonderful job, he seems smarter and more interesting than the hero. So I ended up actually kind of rooting for the bad guy. Dracula seems to have bat pooh for brains and his wife, Mirena, makes the Stepford Wives look like angry feminists (seriously, who wrote her lines straight out of a 1950's soap opera?). But if you can ignore the main characters' stupidity and the plot holes, it's actually pretty entertaining. It's a fun watch, but don't expect to come out of it more enlightened on anything.

345,Galetonius,"Surprisingly ""true"" to history",7,22 January 2015,"Bram Stoker once wrote about Count Dracula. It was his interpretation and fictional story based on a true account. Vlad Dracul, like in this film, was a real person that was renowned in Eastern Europe for his heroic acts and holding back the Ottoman Empire, slaying as many as 100.000 with his guerrilla like tactics. In Western Europe, he was known for being a cruel tyrant, impaling people that opposed him. This story went viral in Germany where it got demonized more and more up to the point where Vlad Dracul was a monster impaling his victims, drinking their blood and feasting on their flesh admits the thousands of impaled bodies. Not very hard to figure out where Bram got his idea. So far so good, because Dracula Untold truly depicts Vlad II as history refers to him, then switching fluently into the demon Bram Stoker and everyone thereafter described.As for this film on its own: Vampires as depicted in Twilight, True Blood and The Vampire Diaries, always struck me as odd. Vampires should either be creepy like in Nosferatu or just hordes of evil like in Blade, Underworld and even From Dusk till Dawn. This film however, is neither and both at the same time. It starts as current vampire depictions would: a loving person bound by evil to fight for the good of the men and women of this world. It then switches to the dark side that we've seen in Blade and Underworld, with an additional touch of supernatural as seen in the more classical versions of Dracula (commanding vampire-bats and such).This strange game of ping pong between the 'old' and 'new' vampire genre makes the movie very interesting. Leaving you at the edge of your seat in one scene, then completely bored in the next. It ends however, with me wanting more of this. A sequel that is hopefully revealed.True: there is little character development. True: it's not really a horror story. True: it's romanticized up to the point where it becomes tedious. But as with a great many other action movies, it holds your attention, finds you rooting for the protagonist and wishing for more.",Dracula Untold
346,guisgarcia,"Good, but could be WAY better",6,31 October 2014,"I usually don't write reviews, mostly because it is a bit difficult to me as a Brazilian to argument in English. But I feel compelled to do so this time, because as a fan of vampire stories - and of Dracula -, I tend to think that as an adaptation, or a creation of a part of the story, the film did not play the role.Another side of the story that almost everyone knows. It was a good plot, if looked from a broad view, but altogether I sensed a shortage of darkness and harshness. It was hardly a Dracula worthy experience, and in just a few moments throughout the movie I really saw the powers of the vampires from the old stories.Luke Evans played a good role as an action movie actor. But he lacks the depth and darkness of the vampire. I could not help but to keeping comparing his acting with Gary Oldman's in Dracula from 1992. Charles Dance is very good. His role is an important part of the story and somewhere may be something more to tell about him but, like other characters and facts, he seemed to be just made up out of nothing. There are some special effects in the movie that did not make any sense to me, like an appearance of ""translucent"" skin on the face of the vampires in some scenes. Also there are sometimes when the vampire crosses streams of sunlight and nothing happens to him, when in the next scene he is pretty careful to hide as much as his boots away from a shiny strip of light.This kind of things, as well as one or two out-of-place jokes, only reinforced the feeling that the movie was nothing more than a hook over a great known story that would sell - as it always does – but got lost in that place Hollywood keeps throwing what could be very good storytelling based on very well availed stories. One and a half hour seemed to have lasted too long.",Dracula Untold
347,ismailkatip,bad story,1,18 October 2014,"A terrible scenario, shoddy effects, bad acting and no gripping on non fictional events that distorts history beyond ridiculous movie. Complete waste of time.Well, in most content which include antic or middle ages style in it always has a thing against the ""easterner"" figure, but in this movie it seems finally they decided to put it in a shape. As Turks.Personally I think this closely related to the position of the Ottoman empire in world stage in those days. During its 700 years of rule, Ottoman empire managed to grow big enough to be a superpower of the day and kept that place for 200 years. Yes Ottoman empire was not formed by saints. But it barely deserve this. I bet nobody thought Vatican's demonization of Turks would be this effective back then. There are even some commenters putting some known terrorist organizations in sentences like equals with Turks. Its like Nazis demonizing Jews to legitimate their killings. Aren't we better than this? Anyone with some skills with google can find who really count Vlad was and the practices at Ottoman empire (although this part might be a little controversial because of propaganda efforts) So I will not go trough them and bore you with realities. But I will say that there are many errors. If the producers decided to go fantastic about Vlad why put real figures against such made up character and humiliate people?That would be really ironic if people of the future mention USA the way producers did to Ottomans in this movie. Not impossible considering the last 50 years of USA.",Dracula Untold

349,helpme-373-347408,Dracula Untold Review - Spoiler Alert,4,2 November 2014,"This version attempts to re-invent the story of Vlad Tepes (played by Luke Evans) for what seems to be no better reason that to create a franchise. The acting was good, special effects great, but the casting as well as the story line and movie pace left a lot to be desired. The movie starts with Vlad's son Art ""Rickon Stark"" Parkinson narrating the story of his father the impaler. It rapidly evolves into showing the sacrifices Vlad & his wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) are willing to make to keep their son safe. The movie quickly moves into introducing a vampire played by Charles Dance (who is great to watch) appearing more animal than human who is for some unexplained reason trapped in a cave that has human skeletons of his victims all over the place; one cannot help but ask ""how is this possible if this master vampire is trapped in this cave in a huge mountain."" Shortly after wards, the story starts going sideways with too many things happening -- the Turks trying to take children, Vlad refusing to give up his son thus starting a war with his ""adoptive"" brother, he strikes a 3-day deal with the vampire which we all know how that ends. Then we leap into the 21st century where Vlad is happily walking city streets running into his reincarnated wife (now named Mina) but being stalked by the Master Vampire who had originally turned him who for another unexplained reason really wants to play games with Vlad. From a personal perspective, I overlooked a lot in the telling but the one plot hole that really annoyed me was the fact that in the beginning of the story, no one really knew what a vampire was and by the end (only 3 days later in the movie) everyone hated, then accepted being turned into one, and knew how to kill and revive one. My belief is that if a studio wants to create a franchise, then time to explain and develop characters is a must particularly when the subject is a character that has had volumes of books written about it and mountains of movie reels shot on it.For viewers that want action and straight entertainment driven by special effects and those who don't particularly care or know the original details behind the Dracula story, this movie - and the subsequent ones no doubt - can be fun to watch. If you are expecting a better re-telling of the Dracula myth, then this movie could be a disappointment.",Dracula Untold

After reading years of history books I have to say this movie though a fictional one...is the closest you will come to getting the real story of what happened 500 years ago.The printing press was invented around this time and Vlads enemies made good use of it spreading propaganda against him.

I've would love to see an sequel to this movie as Dracula has been around for ages so there is not much of an limit to where in time he could appear Again and see the World and its givens from his perspective and to see him grow into the Dracula we know from Bram Stroker's Dracula(1974),Dracula Untold
355,GreatMovieGeek,Has nothing to do with Vlad The Impaler..Not even with the fantasy story written by Bram Stoker,2,17 January 2015,"To Begin With,very few people know the true story of Vlad the Impaler.Hollywood knows nothing about it.This movie is a disgrace to history and a disrespect for the great ruler that Vlad was.First of all he was not the ruler of Transylvania!He was the ruler of Wallachia.Draculea(Dracula) was a nickname given to his father because of his affiliation to the ""Order Of The Dragon"".Vlad was known for being cruel but very just.He was absolutely not a thirsty vampire that drank blood from his enemies.Secondly,the battles shown in the movie are created by the rich imagination of someone.There was a battle between Vlad and Hamza Bey in the winter of 1461-1462,but it was fought south of the Danube River not in Transylvania as the movie shows.After the battle was won by Vlad,he impaled Hamza Bey and his entire army alongside the Danube River.Furthermore,he never had a wife named Mirena nor a child names Ingeras and Cozia Monastery has nothing to do with the battles fought by Vlad the Impaler.Also,Mehmet was not killed by Vlad the Impaler and Mehmet was not wearing a golden plate armor in battles.Other armor worn by both sides is also fake.In addition,the most disturbing part of the movie is the end of it..that is way to much for anyone's imagination.Vlad was assassinated in 1476 and his head was sent to the sultan.In the end of the movie you'll see him in the 21st century talking to a woman that looks like his wife from the ""medieval times"".Even more than this,the lead actor did not portray Vlad's personality.Not even close to it.The action scenes were also awful.In my opinion you should AVOID the movie!However some of you may consider it average if you like fantasy stories and you don't know the history of Vlad the Impaler.",Dracula Untold

It was more believable than the version with Gary Oldman in it. The plot was great too. This is not twilight. The characters are all legit and not flat or boring. You can really care about these people, especially Vlad and his family. Luke Evans really shines in this. It had a great story with some action, but it still let you care about the characters. There were some horror elements, but it is a vampire film. I hope that they have sequels to this film or something of the like because it was great.

It's as good as Game of Thrones, especially since the super-evil Master Vampire, played by Charles Dance, is so reminiscent of his treatment of Tyrell Lannister as to bring the creep factor up several more points. The rewriting of the story as a good guy just trying to stay good is quite a departure, yet the struggle is very evident in Luke Evans' portrayal of Vlad. Echoes of Conan in several scenes brought home the brutality of the character. I did wonder why he didn't save Merina, played convincingly tough by Sarah Gadon. I kept waiting.

I won't let out any spoilers because I would love people to go and see this movie and give their opinions on it but I think if all goes well at the box office there will definitely be a sequel.

Yes it is not that historically accurate but, then how many movies are and this is not a documentary - it is a work of fiction.I enjoyed watching it so much have gone and bought the DVD.

When I was watching, I was engaged consistently, there wasn't very many dull moments in the movie; Either the plot was building, characters were developing, or there was some just plain awesome fight scenes. With that being said, the end of the movie you could tell that they had missed some dates. The special effects quality lessened immensely and the story was kind of ""iffy"", There should have been a little more creativity to end such an amazing movie, but don't let the last 10-20min prevent you from seeing the movie. It was such an awesome change to the movies that are being released right now. If you're reading this to decide on a movie don't read any further, just go ahead and watch the movie and be satisfied that you made the right choice. There is nothing more that I can possibly say to promote this movie.",Dracula Untold
364,heisenberg_collier,Not as bad as I was expecting,7,20 October 2014,"When I was invited to see this movie I had really low expectations because I've gotten tired of vampire movies over the years but once I started to watch I actually was somewhat engaged, especially with the opening scene, instead of the film wasting hours of time trying to explain to you who val the impaler is, it sums it up in the beginning very well.. Yes the film wasn't amazing, but it is worth seeing it has a really good cast and some great visual effects. The story telling is unevenly paced so it can get boring or annoying in some parts. All in all, this film is just plain enjoyable, it has a new take on the whole Dracula concept that we haven't seen on the big screen before. Hopefully we get a better sequel!",Dracula Untold
365,shooterhasan,The betrayal of history,1,1 January 2021,"II.Mehmet(Fatih Sultan Mehmet) had never been a cruel emperor. Vlad never killed any of Ottoman Sultans. He was just a lokal leader, placed by Ottoman Empire and killed by Ottoman soldiers in 1476, because of being one of the most cruel man ever lived in history.
I know this is just a fiction but noone have any rights to use real names. II.Mehmet is one of the wisest and smartest leader ever lived. III.Vlad is one of the most cruel man ever lived.
I suggest you to learn some history, read book!",Dracula Untold
366,eric-striblin-es,Luke Evans is perfect as Dracula (imo),8,3 November 2014,"Let me first get a couple of things out of the way. I am a huge fan of Brahm Stoker's Dracula, that being said I do not hold every movie that comes out to the cross as it were to follow the story perfectly nor do I expect some historical accuracy to Vlad Tepes. Okay whew that's out of the way.I think that Luke Evans portrays Dracula perfectly in look and tone from the way I imagine the character. Some great cinematography in the film and some great battles. My main complaint is that the movie felt short to me despite what must have been 1.5 hour run time (if memory serves, i'm too lazy to verify at the moment) and felt like the film could have expanded to a longer movie and slowed the pace down a bit to allow for a bit better development.Overall I LOVED the film and very much hope a sequel is made with Luke Evans in the lead role.",Dracula Untold
367,elias-j-takacs,It resonated with me,8,7 November 2014,"I have read some of the reviews of people from Turkey and I understand they might have been somewhat insulted by the portrayal of the Turks/Ottomans in this movie.But please understand, a good movie needs a good villain. I am part Hungarian and part Romanian from the Transylvanian region and I recognize all the historical inaccuracies. Yes it's true, the Turks weren't all bad, nor were they all good. No great empire ever is. And great it was...magnificent even. But the Ottomans, whether today's Turks like it or not, make a wonderful villain. Vast armies from a distant land wanting to take over the known world.But back to the movie, and it is a movie. Pure fiction and nothing but. However it did resonate with me very strongly. This movie was quite artistic in fact. The most powerful, symbolic and visceral images from this movie are in my opinion these two: 1. The climb to power when Vlad ascends the cliff to attain Vampiric strength.2. The fall from power when his wife falls from the fortress and no matter how hard he tries, he cannot catch her.In this dark light, the movie tells the story of a tragic hero not unlike those of Shakespearean plays. A man so desperate and obsessed to overcome his adversaries that he is willing to pay any price, including embracing the ultimate darkness that consumed nearly all his people, his wife and even himself. And yet he is a noble figure with redeemable qualities until the very end.It is a cautionary tale that when you make a deal with the devil, there is often a price to pay.And yet, as the movie portrayed, sometimes the darkness offers a comforting embrace.",Dracula Untold
368,meliksah-tg,Historical Movies,1,8 November 2014,"I Know. Its just a Movie.But even if its a Fictional Movie , Historical Movies should base on a little truth. This movie is totally based on lies. Vlad was never a Hero. He was a Killer and even killed his own Citizens and Family. When he was surrounded by Faith sultan Mehmet he jumped on a Horse and run away. But Faith Sultan Mehmets Army catches him and judged him for his Crimes on his own Folks and Citizens. He was beheaded and his Head was brought to Istanbul for Shows.On The other hand Faith and Vlad were Childhood Friends.Faith Sultan Mehmet never lost a Battle against Vlad. Vlad was never a Hero beside he was the worst Coward of the History. He killed for fun. Maybe its an good show and the CGI is gorgeous... But this doesn't change the fact that this Movie is full of bull. Little truth should be added in a Movie. But Just making a Movie for hate to the Ottomans is outrageous. This Movie is just made of Racism.",Dracula Untold
369,malignance,Chewing Gum for the eyes,6,9 November 2014,"While this movie pretty much ignores the history, it's still a good movie, great CGI, good acting and the ending implies a sequel. Many have commented that Vlad was not a good guy in real life, hence the historical figures title of the ""impaler"". The movie does show this in a few scenes but in a interesting if somewhat brief way.Good action scenes, battles and some gory images, but then as it's Dracula, what do you expect.If your looking for a movie to just sit back and have fun watching, Dracula Untold is an enjoyable romp with good actors, Charles Dance is impeccable as always and Luke Evans is good as the main character.",Dracula Untold
370,pamukprensesinkutusu,Dracula OVER-TOLD,5,9 November 2014,"Visually fulfilling otherwise a little boring and predictable.This is meant to be a fantasy-adventure movie, right? In my view it lacks imagination because there are no big surprises in it once you figure out right at the beginning; 'the Turks are the bad guys and Dracula is the savior of his people and/or his loving son who keeps screaming papa..papa...paaapaaaa throughout the film'.The story could have taken a twist or a more powerful climax if Dracula was challenged by an equally powerful immortal. Depicting the Turks as the biggest enemy of Eastern Europe does not really save the film but I am sure many Romanians and Hungarians will appreciate it. Also overly romantic dialogues are questionable; if Dracula had a family I am sure the Turkish sultans did too but as an audience I am not really keen on sitting and watching a 30 minute dialogue overall between a vampire and his wife/son.There are couple of clichés the film throws at you...1- Not all vampires are bad, some of them are good. (Twilight, Daybreakers, Blade and many others have good vampires in them too.) 2-You can kill a vampire with sunshine, silver, a wooden stake or fire but heroic ones will keep coming back. I guess cow manure, tar or a plunger would have no effect on vampires at all.3- It is always the power of cross that wins against all the other faiths, believes and evils of the dark.",Dracula Untold

This film was great,really felt empathy for Dracula,brilliant effects and none stop,acting was good,a nice change to the usual boring vampire flicks Felt more like a superhero movie than a vampire movie, Hope they make a second big thumbs up from me. Please don't go to watch this movie with hopes of the usual Dracula with his cape floating into rooms mumbling ""I WANT TO DRINK YOUR blood"". That type of movie has been done to death. If anything this movie is more like 300 with vampires instead of Spartans",Dracula Untold
372,Shaunpatric,"Great movie, but a tad rushed!",8,28 February 2015,"I waited on this movie for a few months after I had seen the trailer, and I was not disappointed by the plot. Usually I do enjoy a few vampire movies with a strong structure coming from the vampires point of view, for example ""Interview with a Vampire"", but unlike the more dramatic 'teen vampire' style that's condemned as a chick flick, this brings out the more masculine side to these horror movies, although I enjoyed this movie so much the only downfall the film had was the fact that it was rushed so badly. The opening was unlike most other horrors where the suspension starts maybe 15-20 minutes in, this was 5 minutes in and builds to the conclusion almost instantly afterwards, but it definitely made up for this with thrilling special effects and acting. Very good movie and I would highly recommend it! Can't wait for the sequel!",Dracula Untold
373,zeso93,beyond just a simple movie,8,26 January 2015,"OK first of all I should say that this is not a historical documentary that some audiences expect it to be totally accurate and precise about names of characters etc. It has completely a story of its own, well I agree using real names may sound a bad idea when you're not following the historical time-line, but come on, can't any director make changes in a history event and be bit creative about it? I think there's no problem with that as long as the director doesn't claim the movie to be a documentary. When it wasn't meant to be real at first place, what are you guys so upset about? You've come to watch a historical movie? It's just a movie with a fun plot. Fun I mean rather good and pleasant. But yeah, like any other movies it has its flaws. I don't understand how someone would survive from falling of hundreds of meters! That sounds too unrealistic that you wouldn't like to see even in a totally supernatural movie. But as a whole, I liked it. And about its visual effects, well it was perfect in my opinion. You would really enjoy every second of it. And finally I can say that it wasn't just a movie produced just for the sake of entertainment. I dare say it has something more behind it. Watch it one more time and see each character as a symbol of something in this modern world. The scene in which you see Vlad giving his son to the monk or whatever holding a Cross is beyond just its surface meaning which is obviously just the story. I mean Vlad is a monster and his son is still a human, now Vlad is giving his son which I like to say can be humanity to a saviour with a cross that can be symbolized as Jesus Christ who would return to this world for salvation. And there's more. Muslims are shown really cruel and brutal with stone hearts! Which isn't something new in history of movies. Yeah I know in The Crusades, they acted brutal claiming every country and let's say region they could but it's still not the best way of introducing Muslims! Well it was a good movie which you could enjoy without considering historical time-line and details but in my opinion something beyond just entertaining people.",Dracula Untold

So I have been going over my excellent, classic Universal Monster movies (I am only missing TIM and TCFTBL compilation DVDs, which I will get) and I am going full-immersion with the genre again! While this film does not attempt to ""reboot"" the 1931 Dracula film, it is a fun, action- packed, fantasy-type thriller. It reminds me of a cross between a Vampire film and The Lord of The Rings (or The Last Samurai). Luke Evans is the man, truly. The guy was born to play these ""period""- epics (like his role in The Hobbit films and in The Raven and The Three Musketeers) and I loved him as Gaston in the new BATB. The only reason I couldn't give it an unqualified 10-stars is due to the regrettable reliance on CGI- effects. Ah, I guess it's to be expected, these days. They serve the story and I just have to work on ""suspending disbelief"" a bit more than I would otherwise. But, that aside, the film does work with action, horror-elements and pathos. It is a good story, along the lines of ""Game of Thrones"" and films of that ilk. It rocks! See it!",Dracula Untold

SpoilerSo when you hear Dracula, you think horror film, blood drinking, pale white. well you don't really get that, it's by no means a horror and theirs very limited biting.Near the opening Vlad and his men discover some dead turks near their castle (which they soon get the blame off), and go to investigate a cave in the mountain which they suspect other may be. The boys get a shock when a monster rips them apart all but Vlad who manages to escape. Vlad returns to the castle and not long after the Turks appear wanting to take his son and all young boys to serve the Turks army. Vlad is in two minds , Risk war and everyone's certain death or give up his son and ll the boys when he is supposed to be the king. After trying to negotiate with the Turks he is disrespected and war becomes the answer for our noble hero.

379,dimericoch,Why was this movie ever made or released onto the worldSo So BAD,1,12 June 2016,"This not a Dracula movie. It just used the Dracula name to sell the movie. The direction is so bad that fight scenes are done fast and you hardly understand who is fighting who. Dracula became Dracula by drinking some blood from a vampire so that he can take on a whole army and kill them by himself. The Plot is very unbelievable that you just think why I am still watching it. I normally can find a thing or two good about movies, but not with this one. There is absolutely nothing good. It is also a typical movie to make one side look bad (that side being the Turkish Muslims). People just do not understand this movie. It is not a horror movie, as the name might say. It is not even a good attempt to make people understand why and how Dracula became Dracula. It is just a cheap idea made into a movie to make you watch it by, using the name of Dracula in order to make money. Do not waste your time. You will a few fighting scenes, done very badly. No horror. No history. No thriller. Cheaply directed action with no plot. Nothing more. AVOID.",Dracula Untold

Sure, as someone familiar lore from the original Bram Stoker Novel, I found myself questioning whether or not this film was really meant to fit within the original cannon, or if it was meant to be part of its own alternate continuity. The latter seems to be true, but I don't see that as a problem. I've l grown to love MUCH looser takes on Dracula. As a stand-alone story, Dracula Untold takes every opportunity to steer the narrative in an interesting direction. Several times I found myself thinking, 'oh, it would be so cool if they did this next', and then they went there. The ultimate conclusion may have be forgone, but the journey sure was a ride. Everything was pretty tight. There were no parts I can recall that dragged down the pacing, which was pretty heart-pumping throughout. I loved how many little details had come back into play by the end. This version of Dracula is well preformed and also surprisingly sympathetic, even reasonable, despite being convincingly bad@#$. I enjoyed how his powers were and weaknesses were represented, and taken advantage of, with the final fight being my favorite. And for some reason, I find Dracula turning into a swarm of bats much cooler than him just turning into one.

Also, Janissaries were mostly of Albanian and Bosnian origin from West; Georgian and Armenian from East. As far as I know, Wallachia together with Moldavia had their autonomies.

But it still does an amazing job at showing how our ""Vlad"" in the movie, acted out of love and wanted to protect his family, but the end result is the same as the ""Vlad the impaler"" our history remembers.. so to me it's just a great way to tell the story. It also sets up for a sequel in my opinion, which we probably won't get.. or maybe your supposed to imagine that for yourself? I don't know.. but I do know if they had a sequel..

Luckily, this movie was refreshing for me. A different take on a tale none of us were alive to witness and testify to the veracity of the details. Told from Dracula's (and sometimes his son's) point of view, placing him as the sometimes misunderstood hero fighting for the freedom of his people from what he saw as a tyrannical rule.
No one wants the people they love to be seen as the monster in their own story, so give this fictitional-nonhistorical telling of vlad's actions and motives in his imaginary son's own imaginary words.Action, good acting, a different telling of a familiar story, and for the first time his wife wasn't insane and driven to self harm.

401,e_berilaz,"Great CGI, no relation to history whatsoever...",3,6 October 2014,"I've watched this movie with an open mind, intending not to look into the historical facts and just enjoy a good CGI-packed film, that tells the story of my country's most famous ancestor. But I couldn't, I just could. They've went on to use actual names for people and places, that some may think some things are actually true. Absolutely nothing from this movie has to do with reality!!! So, the year is 1442, when the real Vlad the Impaler was 11 years old, having been born in 1431. He's opposed to the sultan Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople (present-day Istanbul), who, at the time, was only 10 years old. Yet their characters are a bit older than that, aren't day?Then the need to connect Vlad ""Dracula"" the Impaler to Transylvania. They've made him prince. Uhmm... he wasn't the ruler of Transylvania, he was the ruler of Wallachia, which is just south of Transylvania. He merely stayed imprisoned in Transylvania for a good 12 years. He never ruled Transylvania, as the movie depicts, but I guess they had to stay with the legend, because who cares about history, right?!Then there's the Ottoman side. Mehmed II was a child at the time described in the movie. He did try to come and personally punish the rebellious Vlad, but that happened in 1462, so 20 years later. And he did not die by Vlad's hand, although he was almost shot by an arrow of the Wallachian prince during a night attack.One last thing. They've totally messed it up with the geography. I mean, look for yourself for the Tihuta passage and Cozia monastery and how you can get from Bran castle to the monastery using that passage. Let's just say that between the buildings and the passage there are some hundreds of kilometers.If you're not taking in consideration the historical facts (which basically don't exist, apart from the resemblance of some names), the movie is rather thin. The story doesn't hold and some parts are kind of forced there so the action might have some coherence - which it lacks, in parts. (I mean, seriously, an army marching miles and miles blind-folded? OK, I'll buy, for the movies's sake, but gathering an entire country's people to a single monastery...?!?! What were we? The Vatican?! Or someone falling for hundreds of meters and not dying instantly when they hit the ground...) I believe the movie would have been a lot better if they didn't use actual places and figures and they would have kept the persona drafted only from legends, with no historical ground. But it's Hollywood, so who cares about history, right?!",Dracula Untold
402,Kaljus,Dracula - Hero beneath the skin of a monster,7,24 November 2014,"Read till the end. Lets start with telling that this movie does not have almost any artistic value. This movie is not meant to be a masterpiece it follows the latest trend of Hollywood aiming at making money. It wont have any huge impact but may i tell you if you are like i fan of fantasy combined with swords slashing this movie is a must watch, what it promises it delivers. Dracula untold CGI heavy action flick. It epic on occasion but the feeling quickly fades away. If you love seeing good CGI this movie will most certainly not disappoint you, there are some amazing action scenes that will make your blood rush. This movie favours fast pace over character development even tho you can still manage to connect to evans's Vlad and understand him. Who should watch this movie: Those who love: Action, Sword fights, vampires and CGI. Who should not watch this movie: If you in order to enjoy a movie need deep character development or if you just dislike action cgi, or if you expect this movie to be a EPIC FANTASY you will find it lacking. And finally it is not Bram Stokers Dracula Key plot mover: Sacrifice, This movie plays with notion how much would one give in order to protect those which he loves.",Dracula Untold

Although the history was falsified in the movie maybe because of the making a popular movie reasons, everyone knows the difference between Ottoman Empire and Turkey today. So it was quite funny to watch the ignorance.What has been observed, actors were pushed to act and someone really hates the Turks and mixed his/her ignorant emotions to the movie.. What a shame.Lastly, they were in position to utilise their capability to a better story, a story which everyone was expected..

We were just wrapping up some fine dining at Buca De bepo, just one of many fine dining establishments there where we came across this movie playing at the theater over there. (U)nanimously we decided to give it a shot as we love so many other Universal pics like King Kong and Snow White and the Huntsman( Did you know they're making a sequel!?). (D)idn't think twice and saw it and .....wow! (I) think we both agree that Luke Evans was perfect as Dracula.(O)h, and the story was soooo engaging!(P)lease don't get me started on the effects-- amazing! People at Universal definitely know what they're doing! And it even set up for a shared universe at the end!(L)ike, Wouldn't that be awesome!?? I think what Marvel did with their Shared universe is acceptable but thats going to be nothing compared to what univeral has planned. (A)sk yourself, Who wants to see captain America and Hulk go at it when you can see wolfman and the mummy pal around!! (N)ot to mention, Dracula and the invisible man throws barbs as they take on threats like Van Helsing and The creature from the Black Lagoon!(T)he bottom line is -- Everyone wants this to happen and this movie is the Harbinger that will bring us the shared universe to rule them all!

Has a few eye candy scenes from Luke Evans, good special effects,good cast but the plot seems rushed and scattered... I didn't care much about historical facts since the dawn of film there's not even one vampire movie completely faithful either to history or to literature! Just name one!There's none! Its atmosphere was okay, among other actors with the same problem, Mehmet's hairdo ought to be from that historical period, so I found that detail a huge flaw from the costume design team's part, it cheapens the movie and the character portrayed.

I hear most of you disliked it because you don't find it realistic or maybe it doesn't go with the real story (i don't know), but guess what, that is the way CINEMA works!!

407,mbmincu,Really now?,3,28 October 2014,"First thing first - i'm Romanian. And thus i find this film insulting. You would get a more documented movie if you assign it to a 12 year old as homework. The plot is weak, the story is dumb and the whole movie is cheesy. Sort of a medieval teenage vampire flick with occasional 3D scares. the geography of the movie is dead wrong. The locations feel more like a manga than Transylvania. And - here's the best part - Dracula - a bloodthirsty medieval ruler turned vampire has a son named Ingeras. In Romanian that means ""Little angel"". Now imagine a medieval warlord called Little Angel of Transylvania. Yep, it's that dumb! Save your money, it's really not worth paying for this. I'm usually pretty tolerant to crappy movies but this one almost made me leave half way through.",Dracula Untold
408,Kristofferlol,"An entertaining movie, but...",7,22 June 2015,"I watched this movie with an expectation of it not being a masterpiece of a film, but something fun to pass the time. And i actually got pretty much what i expected. It was a fun movie with great casting, Luke Evans plays an amazing Dracula. I like the new twist on the Dracula universe, even though i am not that familiar with the old ones. If you see the movie, without being hung up on historical and geographical facts, I think you will have a good time. But the movie have some major plot holes that are just too annoying to ignore:First of all he becomes incredibly overpowered when he get his vampire powers, and that I can accept. It is when he chooses not to use his powers i am annoyed. He kills a thousand men, but later in the movie he is standing around waiting on the enemy army when he sees it in the distance. He could have easily turned himself into bats, flown over there, killed them, and won the war. Instead he stands around doing nothing even though he loses his powers the next morning. As i mentioned he can turn himself into bats and fly at the speed of lightning or something, but when his wife is falling of a tower he is unable to catch up with her. And that is not all. Before his wife dies she uses her final breath to tell him to feed on her to make his powers permanent so he can save their son. But why doesn't he give her some of his blood and turn her as well. They had a million turks to feed on. By the way his son magically changes position from the tower to down on the ground on the back of a horse, in the same time his wife uses to fall from the tower. When the Turks have Vlads son, Mehmed and his army suddenly turn around and travels back as if they have won, just because they have Vlads son and his wife is dead. Why would they have think they had won when Vlad is still alive? Of course he is coming to save his son. Mehmed also knows a little to much about Vlads vampire weaknesses when not one person have survived to figure them out. Oh yes, he also walks straight through a ray of sunlight at one point, that should have burned him.Although the movie have some big flaws, I did enjoy it very much and would actually recommend it to anyone looking for an entertaining movie. Hoping for a sequel!",Dracula Untold

Over all it was great entertainment, not another cheesy vampire movie. Yeah, the history was incorrect but I like changing history, maybe seeing it from his point of view. Or like this movie just making good entertainment. I did not expect Hollywood to write actual history facts. They normally don't so that is what I expected and I was pleased. Leaving the cinema last night I found myself arguing with half the audience about the movie. Half of them said the movie sucked, and the other half (myself and daughter included) loved it. Now, this is a type of movie that will divide the audience so much that there will not be a middle. One will either love it or hate it (which seems to be a pattern in recent Hollywood history). By just watching the trailer it was clear as day that this will not be a masterpiece or a rebirth of Stocker's fable. So I ask a very plausible question: What did you expect?I liked it so much I want to own it!",Dracula Untold

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler) I've thought a lot but couldn't find the idea of changing history. I don't wanna be rude but you can not create your own history using illusion of real history. If you do that probably it will be the worst rating at the IMDb like Gunday (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2574698/? ref_=chtbtm_tt_1)..

Why no one tell what 3rd of Vlad done the Turks and his punishment methods. He torture Turks soldier ıts unfair only Turks look like barbarian. Please when you done this kind of movie read some books to knows who is Mehmed or who is Vlad. And Turks aren't barbarian if they barbarian why some of the contries want to be part of the Turks. You don't know our history. I am repeating again first read the history of Turks or Vlad then do the movie. thanks for reading me by the way the movie is really bad it was awful.,Dracula Untold

416,mikaru89,Confusing and illogical plot,3,26 October 2014,"Very confusing plot!!! Also, The CG can only be classified as adequate. For the CG: it's annoying especially because most of the time it's either Vlad shape shifting (black bats swarm) that blur to some black shadow and jumping around in a ""flash-like"" manner, or a blurry ""Vlad vision"" of him looking at silver. The only good cg is on the trailer on which Vlad smashes the ground leading a bat swarm to wreck the enemy. Other than that it's only okay. The plot: the beginning is quite fine until the middle where the people (especially his wife) turns against him for no apparent reason. Ending in an awkward moment when Vlad comes out of the burning house and gets mad to the people, after that the people carry on like nothing happens (what!?) Also, After losing his wife the movie suddenly goes on to ""zombie infection"" mode (what?!) didn't the vampire said that to be another vampire one will be released from the curse as it is handed over to the new vessel (CMIIW) then how can he ""infect"" people with the curse?? The climax battle also illogical, if Vlad was weakened by the silver, then how can he shape shift and dodge the stake at the end? Why not do that in the first place instead of sword fighting? That way we can avoid watching badly blurred Vlad vision. After that yet another annoyingly awkward moment when his people (now vampire) wants to eat his son. Ultimately ending in Vlad stabbing the vampire and impaling them just to make the ""Vlad the impaler"" sign. All in all this movie has a very confusing twist. It's confusing because each of them are concluded awkwardly. Also it's because the twist seems to have no effect to the story flow at all. 3/10",Dracula Untold

418,delidolunet-268-44582,Disappointing movie with a terrible and unreal scenario,1,9 October 2014,"Lets think about it. III. Vlad (aka Dracula) is a killer who is war criminal (who is poisoning water cells, kills animals, releases leprosy patients from prisons to get sick Ottoman soldiers after he lost the war. Actually as a real mean about III. Vlad (aka Dracula) is that Murderer, Traitor, War criminal. And this movie shows that character as kind of a hero.On the other hand think about the Turkish Ottoman Sultan, Faith Mehmet. He changed the history, he is one of the best commander, conqueror and a statesman who brings to Ottoman empire the first human rights and after his conquests he set free the people for their religional choices and their freedom! (While you have the power of domination why would you choose to be a honest and a respectful person? This means a lot!). So, the real mean is for the Ottoman Sultan is that, he is a real hero for his and other people who lives on his lands.But what does the movie tells us with the scenario? The III. Vlad is a hero and the Ottoman Sultan Faith is a villainous person.This is totally lie. You can't just say this is a movie. If you want to use real historical names in your movie you have to respect the real history. The movie says Faith is killed by III. Vlad in 1422, But Faith is conquered Istanbul (Constantinapolis) in 1453 and he changed the age with this action.So, you can't just say this is a movie. A lot of person who is have no idea about the history is going to choose to believe this which is doesn't contains real historical things.Make sure yourself you've read this Wiki page to get some real information.

And yes, it happens in a hell of a lot of movies. I just take it as a universe apart and that's it. It is fantasy after all. Although it does raise a question of what Hollywood is doing. They should have done one with the turks being good and Dracula actually being the bad guy, now that would have been better.But the truth is that I really like it, I want to watch it again.

425,ilikethat94,absolutely phenomenal,10,15 October 2014,"This movie was by doubt one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Dracula Untold told the true story of Vlad Tepes, The Impaler. My boyfriend and I did research about the true story behind Vlad, and this movie was 95% close to the true story. We took every aspect of this movie very seriously, and we were VERY proud. My jaw dropped for the first time in years in this movie. Luke Evans was amazing in every way, and portrayed Vlad perfectly. Charles Dance did an equally amazing job. If you loved him in Game of Thrones, you'll love him even more in this. Dracula was historical, bad-ass, and sexy. We're going to see this movie again in theaters in a couple days. I could not give a better review. Bravo to all the people that worked with this movie. It was excellent in every way.IF ANYONE says that this movie was not historically accurate they are wrong. My boyfriend went to Dracula's castle, did research for months, and talked to locals in Transylvania. The only parts of the story that were wrong in the movie was that Mehmed and Dracula were probably not raised together, brothers, or friends. And Dracula's wife committed suicide because she heard Vlad died in battle and fell to her death during the raid, not pushed off. There were also two versions on how Vlad got his power, 99% of Transylvanians believe the way the movie told it. I was surprised that they did not call the vampire's s-t-r-i-g-o-i.Wallachia was part of the Province of Transylvania. So don't get that mistaken. It was accurate.But the other story is how his wife commits suicide while Vlad was in battle because she was told he was dead. She jumps into the cliffs in the sea and kills herself, gets washed back to shore and the people bring her back to the castle. When Vlad walks in, he takes off his armor, cries and stabs his sword into the cross. Blood drains out and he drinks the blood that gives him his power. He renounces god and becomes the vampire we all know. But most Transylvanians don't believe that story.But don't let the history aspect of the story fool you. It's pretty damn amazing. It's my favorite movie this year.",Dracula Untold
426,nelsonspyk,Balancing a good story with commercialism (SPOILER ALERT),6,10 October 2014,"PROS: 1.A remake of a good franchise, adding the word ""UNTOLD"" was sheer genius. 2. The directors delivery of the family life of Dracula was a beautiful backdrop for Dracula to turn to the dark-side. 3. My favorite action sequence was when he killed the emissaries sent to collect his son. 4. Best ""Romantic"" scene was Dracula trying to grab his wife when she was falling down the mountain 5. Best dramatic scene was when he confronts the monster and makes a deal. The delivery was inspired. 6. Dracula's amour...really nice 7. First class VFX, VFX is enough reason to see this movieCONS: I will stick to the glaring ones 1.Killing his wife was risky, but added dept to the story. Her re-introduction as re-incarnated in the future was weak. Yes it was to set up part 2 and create the commercial ending, but it was lame. 2. Killing everyone in the temple where they took refuge was also very weak. Because we see the son (Only ""survivor"") being crowned King. 3. The fight for Dracula to get his son back in the tent of the Sultan was embarrassing. The movie should have ended in the Monastery. His wife dying, and him saving his son & his people. They pay the ultimate sacrifice of walking into the sun. He is later brought to life by the fanatic lad. In all it was an okay film.",Dracula Untold

Luke Evans plays Vlad well and brings a wonderful vibe to the role. The story wasn't ground breaking but it was a breathe of fresh air among over used and tired plot devices being used in a large amount of movies now days. They did a great job and Dracula Untold is an interesting take on a mixture of the historical Vlad Tepes and the fictional Dracula. Review after review people are giving a low score:""I've watched this movie with an open mind, intending not to look into the historical facts and just enjoy a good CGI-packed film, that tells the story of my country's most famous ancestor.

Absolutely nothing from this movie has to do with reality!"" ""You can't just say this is a movie. If you want to use real historical names in your movie you have to respect the real history"".This is a FICTIONAL MOVIE! Truthfully every review saying anything resembling the quotes above is obvious and nonsensical. If I was watching a documentary about Vlad III I could understand complaining about how inaccurate it is but luckily this isn't supposed to be a biography so don't treat it like one. Movies are supposed to be FAKE, IMAGINARY stories even if they are BASED off of real people, events or places. SO GET OVER IT!

Do not expect incredible acting or perfect dialogs, but the effects were well made and it had an interesting story to tell. The story of Dracula has been an inspiration for years and many movie makers tried to tell a different story each time. In this movie the story is innovative and it tries to take us back to the time when ""Dracula"" was just a name and didn't have the meaning we now know.

436,Lovelaws,Awful,1,9 November 2014,"As vampire/Super natural enthusiast I had such high hopes for this one but sadly words can not describe how disappointed I am, it was straight out awful, first it takes a very long time for an hour and half movie for the story to develop, then the so cold Prince Dracula is represented as mighty, almost God like trough out the whole movie except when it counts then he just suck (big time).there are so many movie sins in this picture that you just can not look the other way, worst hour and half of my life, I would give it less than a star if that existed, I don't think that anyone should lose time on this one.",Dracula Untold
437,olcii-og,Disappointed,4,14 November 2014,"The movie is worth watching only if you are objective about it when you watch it. Because Luke's acting is really good and you can enjoy it. A man doing whatever he can to save the ones he loves. That's cool. However, the abuse of the history is just shocking. What I think is that this is just brainwashing. Just look it up on google and read some things about ""Vlad the Impaler"". And the death of the Sultan Mehmed is not like this. And these are just some parts of it. So please, director and the writers or anyone that's going to make a movie which includes history in it, Just read some writings or whatever you can find on the internet from different resources about history and try to be decent if you are going to involve history in your movie. Thanks.",Dracula Untold
438,reichert-constantin,Very enjoyable movie.,9,13 May 2021,"I cannot believe the insane amount of 1 star reviews trashing this movie for portraying a turkish leader inaccurately. Um, hello? It's a fantasy movie. Was Vlad the Impaler really a vampire who can control the weather and a horde of bats? I think not.Don't listen to the 1 star reviews from the thin skinned whiners who can't let people enjoy movies without injecting politics and race.",Dracula Untold
439,levykaren-ek,For Those Comparing to History go Watch the Dark Prince and move on,7,12 October 2014,"I don't write many reviews but I am tired of seeing stupid reviews on this movie.I'm going to state this right now before going on. Dracula, at least the vampire part, is a legend and therefore fiction and the real Dracula, the real person in history, is not really illustrated in this movie and was not meant to be. This movie was new twist on the Dracula stories, deferring to all previous movies and creating its own story line. Not a classic horror or historical movie of the life of Vlad the Impaler so if you wanted to see a movie like the rest of Dracula movies or for it to be close to the historical value of the real person, then stop now and don't watch it. I've seen so many reviews saying it's nothing like the history books...well duh it's FICTON! HE'S A DANM VAMPIRE!!Now on to the movie. Like I said it is a new twist to Dracula. He is a powerful warlord that has earned a great reputation and in this movie he seeks to become a vampire to protect his people and his family from the Turkish armies. So if you wanna see a bad ass Dracula single handily destroy an army, this is for you. This movie, in my opinion, was more of an action movie with cool CG effects. There is a little romance and drama thrown in with the scenes with his family and his people and such but for the most part it has a good pace and has a good balance of all three. The acting was pretty good and the main character in my opinion did a good job. Anyways Dracula in this movie was a bad ass, you get to see him use some of cool vampire powers to kill hundreds of soldiers and you get to see him become a hero for once. I don't want to give away any real spoilers to the movie for those who want to see it but go in with an open mind and just enjoy this movie.",Dracula Untold
440,thephoenixsantana,"Please don't let these petty history buffs sway you, this was one hell of a movie.",9,20 November 2014,"Let me start by getting this out of the way, it is absolutely annoying when people try to flex history knowledge in reviews about movies that deal with real life historical time and figures. This movie is in absolutely NO WAY WHATSOEVER meant to be a biopic about Vlad the Impaler or Sultan Mehmet. This movie is about the mystical, fictional character Dracula which means mystical and fictional does not require the element of fact. So does this movie have to hit on every single actual point dealing with Vlad or Mehmet or Turkey or Transylvania? The answer is no. This movie does not have ""Based on a True Story"" in the prologue so history critics, please. Spare us your vast knowledge on how THIS was suppose to be or how THAT person actually died in real life or how THIS person didn't really do THAT. That's not the purpose of the movie. This movie was made for pure entertainment, not educational purposes. Now the movie. Great story-line, great visuals, and just overall a kick-ass adaptation of the very many Dracula portrayals. If you are a vampire lover, you will appreciate the original yet modernized skill set of Dracula and vampires in general when you think back on the horrible vampire images we have had in the past few years. (Hint: Movie titles that rhyme with ""Highlight"", ""Blue June""...I think you get the picture.) The movie is very well rounded also. It's not too long, has just the right amount of action for the guys, just the right amount of emotion and romance for the ladies, and has the capacity to be a stay at home alone flick or even a cool date night flick that can just be something enjoyable to make time past. As I said before, this movie has no intent on being historically accurate, it just wanted to do something different and that is give Dracula a back story because truth be told, the way Dracula became how he is has never been a topic of attention on the big screen. Finally it is and a fine job getting it done. This movie is definitely worth the watch.",Dracula Untold
441,UthatNOOB,Best vampire movie ever,8,8 November 2014,This is the best vampire movie i have ever seen they don't really make that many vampire movies. and this is the perfect movie for me but its not one of the movies i could watch 3 times in a week. but i watched it 2 times its a really good movie and good story telling of Dracula. in this story Dracula is the good person that just wants to take care of his family and the people. love the actor who plays Dracula just makes it better also great effect and filming but i was a little disappointed that it wasn't more combat action but still i love it but it looks like there will be a second one hopefully it will i think the second one would be better then the first.,Dracula Untold

He did what he did to help save his people and family.The story-line is actually pretty great and special effects are really well done!Luke Evans executes the role of Dracula Perfectly!For me this movie is honestly worth an 8/10 and I am secretly hoping for a sequel, if you have seen the movie and the ending, you'll understand why.

And non of them could prove this movie to be bad, they are only nagging about the fact that the turk army was torn to pieces in this movie and weren't successful to do genocide as they really did in the history ! Please do not read the turks reviews and watch this nice action flick ! I really enjoyed the CGI ! The story is very engaging and keeps you on the edge of your chair, also it is good that the story is being told from another perspective than the old one which only shows the bad part of Dracula ! It shows how evil like the ottoman empire has made vlad to become evil himself to defend his people. There is another good point in this movie: they didn't show an army of retards so vlad can kill and prevail easily , instead they were smart and tricked him. Last but not least , i really loved the ending part were it shows him in the new world and the hope that the second volume of this title will come out in near future .i guess the second vol will be even better ! Watch and enjoy this great work !",Dracula Untold
444,Kafiri,Untold tales must remain untold,2,8 March 2015,"To summarize this movie: There is a reason it is ""Dracula Untold"" and it is because it was so bad that no one told it before. Untold tales like this one must remain untold.The cast wasn't so bad. I myself counted three Game of Thrones actor, including Charles Dance, the best one in the movie. And also, the protagonist just made the Hobbit trilogy, he is a good actor too. I know it isn't a horror movie, it is an action/dark superhero kinda movie, but still, the story was so lame. A plot based on revenge with lack of chemistry between the actors and all that squeezed in a 90 minutes movie. Although it was a short movie, I felt like it never ended. I understand there was people that felt this movie was pure entertainment, but I couldn't even watch it with this vision. There are a lot of ""ok"" movies that are better worth watching than this one and that will entertain you more. The end was funny. They thought it would have a sequel.",Dracula Untold

It was exciting and entertaining and would enjoy it if there was another movie to come in the future.this movie caught me from the beginning. Some may hate this movie because it doesn't base off of the Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. This movie focus more on the legends and stories (that some believe to be true) about 'Vlad the Impaler' the prince of Wallachia. 'Vlad's' history is what led to the famous Bram Stoker's novel, Dracula. 'Vlad' was the original Dracula. But Its just a movie, in which i found vary enjoyable to sit down with popcorn and watch. this movie was awesome in my opinion. but some will hate it and other will love it. in which i can say i'm one of those who loves it.",Dracula Untold

However I was so disappointed, I was literally bored all the way through and couldn't wait for it to end! I know the history of Vlad and sure OK Hollywood likes to change things and why not spice it up a little and make him into an actual fantasy vampire. But it's supposed to be Dracula Untold, many people don't know the true story about Vlad. He wasn't a vampire, he was just a normal human being! I think the writers should have focused more on the story portraying the truth, instead they've just turned it into another misconception. I really don't know how people can rate this movie over 6/10 seriously! I studied Video and Film Production at Uni, I know what should make a film successful and this is definitely not it!",Dracula Untold

I liked the most that they used accurate historical stuff: retreat to monastery , the night attack , etc all Basically is a prequel to the book as the movie ends where the book starts so we will see and i hope we will see a sequel for it. Really good acting. I wasn't fan of the Vampires movies but this one has a nice twist and we were left unanswered quite some answers to get. If you are looking for a Dracula by the book u will be very disappointed. Is like an alternative story that fill out the historical facts . For me that was really nice. Also many years Romanian accused Hollywood for distorting the facts and their history. The film has a very good historical documentation . They did a good job in researching the true facts about Vlad , who was a very good leader , a genius strategist who defeated the turks when no one could.",Dracula Untold
449,sebastianjake1998,Brilliant!,10,2 October 2014,"This movie was everything I hoped for and more, it is certainly not to be missed. In short, this movie takes elements from several things, it combines the history behind Vlad Tepes as well as Bram Stoker's masterpiece while revamping the lore to make an epic action movie. To be clear, if you're expecting a remake of Francis Ford's Dracula you will be disappointed, the key for this movie, is to go in with a very open mind, given that these kinds of movies are not for everyone. All in all, I loved it. Luke Evans played his role perfectly, as well as the rest of the cast. This was an epic action movie with elements from the horror genre and the perfect kickoff to the new Classic Monsters Cineverse. Not to be missed.",Dracula Untold
450,jfowles1992,Oh dear.,4,11 October 2014,"I'm usually one to try and find the good things about a movie. So I went into this with 2 minds either A: This is going to be a movie based in history with details tweaked or added to make the (only ever predicted) link between Vlad and Dracula. or B: This is going to be an action vampire movie which uses Vlads name and time period as a gimmick.Turns out, it was a mish-mash of both and neither worked.It rewrote history to fit what it needed. Putting it bluntly? Vlad wasn't a nice guy. He was a downright murderer, torturer and was generally hated/feared by most of his populous. In this, he's portrayed as a kind ruler saving a fallen/reviving kingdom. It also showed many inconsistencies regarding Mehmed, i.e dates and method of his death, costume and even his nicknames were massively out of place.""Okay"" You're saying, ""But i'm just looking for a good vampire movie with some action"". Well then go watch from Dust til Dawn again. This movie, ignoring the historical inaccuracies is still poor. The CGI looks rushed together, yes, i know. It's supposed to be dark, but at times I felt this was used as an excuse to make poor CGI. Also there are so many plot holes. Here's a few of my favourite: 1. Vlad cannot go in the sun because he's a vampire. Yet, in the tent where he show's this to his Queen, there are numerous rays of light touching him and doing nothing. Then, he rips some tenting away, revealing the same amount of light which starts burning him to a crisp. 2. Just after leaving this tent (which was streaming with light) they are now in a dark woods... 3. There comes a moment where Vlad has to defeat part of Mehmed army before the sun comes up otherwise burny death. However, moments later, he all of a sudden remembers he has the power to block out the sun with storm clouds. This power would have stopped so many other situations from happening. I just don't get it. 4. If it's literally just direct sunlight, then why not get an parasol? He's out in the day a lot and never gets burnt until the sun is literally glaring on his skin. 5. Oh yes. And if a vampire burns up in the sun, he's dead forever... unless he then happens to have someone feed him some blood again... Then that's totally cool, no questions asked.I'd advise people not to see this. At least not in cinema. I feel bad for the actors in this who i'm sure are already regretting their agents choices.",Dracula Untold
451,lorettabrannelly,The worst movie I've ever seen,1,3 October 2014,"I wish I was joking but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I've been trying to think of anything that comes close but I just can't. This movie may have given me a terminal illness, I'm not sure, I will need to check with a medical professional and update once I know. The movie is filled with plot holes and completely ridiculous scenes. I never thought a vampire movie would disappoint me. I won't spoil it with spoilers because it's so ridiculous, you'll just think I'm joking anyway. The whole movie is a continuity issue, which is why there's no section for mistakes here on IMDb because the main issue was the script and terrible acting. I wish I hadn't paid money to see this, although if it were free, I'd still think it cost too much. I feel like I've aged since seeing this like my life was dragged out for the 92 minutes this trash lasted. I can't believe it got a 6.6 out of 10. Honestly, 6.6 out of 100 would be pushing it. It deserves a minus score. I once saw a homeless man defecate himself while begging. That was far more entertaining than this movie. I would not recommend it, not even to my worst enemy. Hitler would be watching this movie in hell as punishment.",Dracula Untold

The only thing I didn't like was that it was a little bit hurried and short. Finally I loved it. It wasn't horror nor romantic. It was a combination of horror and action. Some historical experts would argue some of the plot and characters, but this is pure fictional. Everybody has it's own perspective and way of imagining stories. For a first long movie the director does show a lot of talent, but experience is also what he needs. Long story short it was a great movie.

457,jpwilliams-127-342720,Marvel's agents of Dracula?!?!?,3,7 October 2014,"I had been looking forward to this picture for some time. I am quite impressed by Luke Evans (a good local Welsh boy!) and had high hopes for him in this. The trailers were a bit stylised but I had the impression that there was an element of historical accuracy BEFORE it veered of into the vampire stuff. However this was not the case, nor was there any resemblance to pretty much any of the generally accepted Dracula story...and this was only the beginning of my disappointment.Whoever decided to cast Dominic Cooper as Memhet needs to have a change of career. Surely there are sufficient decent middle eastern actors around to adequately portray the Sultan warlord rather than a (general rather decent) white actor who looked like some fake tanned, coiffed, guy-liner wearing Essex boy on a night out rather than a ruthless Turk warrior... it was truly laughable.Charles Dance lent a decent air of sinisterness (is that a word) to proceedings but his involvement was short at first and daft subsequently.There was zero authenticity to the locations, buildings or any of the background to the story and it suffered as a result. 'Broken-Tooth Mountain'? who thought of that gem...this was Transylvania, not Wyoming!! The whole film was disjointed and never really got into any rhythm, lurching from one set piece to the next with very little character build. I found myself having no empathy with any of the main characters, even Vlad himself, it may have been the accent which was somewhere between Stephen Marchant and the count from Sesame Street.The whole thing was so CGI battle oriented that I wouldn't have been surprised to see Thor popping up to lend a hand. And the ending was such an obvious link to sequel (with Dracula as some kind of modern day super hero presumably) that I actually laughed! I really wanted to enjoy this film but it was awful and I felt embarrassed for the actors who were, by and large, quality performers with decent films to their credit. I'm sorry to say, avoid this or watch it on DVD but don't waste the price of a cinema ticket on it unless you really have no knowledge or interest in the story of Dracula. This pretends to be the story of how he became the vampire but it was so incidental to the obvious desire to get to the battle scenes that it was faintly ridiculous.If only someone would have the vision to make a 'Kingdom of Heaven' style film of the real history of Vlad Dracul (the real person not the vampire) possibly using the cracking CC Humphreys book, then it would be worth seeing and would also be far more exciting and interesting as the usual vampire twaddle constantly being trotted out.However, I think that is unlikely if this film was anything to go by...shame.",Dracula Untold

For starters if you expect it.to be true to history watch a documentary instead second off to the people complaining about the real life vlad he actually was a hero to his own people from wiki:It is important to consider that most of the documents containing graphic violence, high numbers regarding deaths, and claims that Vlad took sadistic pleasure in torture, all came from his enemies, especially German Saxons. It is also important to note that the people Vlad Dracula killed were his enemies and condemned criminals. Neither his use of capital punishment nor its exaggeration by his opponents were unusual for the time. So some reviews must be from one of his haters but if you haven't seen it go see it its worth it and btw CGI is in EVERY MOVIE NOW SO QUIT COMPLAINING!!!!",Dracula Untold

A standard action movie.However, I can't watch this without feeling that one of the most iconic tales of all time has been, well, ""raped"" in lack of a better word. It feels as though they have googled the names of all original characters to add some ""historical reference"", and justify the use of Draculas great name to create attention, when this tale has nothing to do with Bram Strokers original novel. I realize that there have been many adaptations, but this one is just insulting to anyone who has ever read Dracula or has any sort of appreciation for the original tale.And since when have vampires been burned by silver?

461,southlander-gd,"Gorgeous, Melancholy and Heroic – thanks to Evans & sets",8,11 October 2014,"A previous reviewer mentioned the negative comments were from, unsurprisingly, Turks. During my first viewing (seen it twice and planning a third visit to the cinema) it struck me how the Ottoman menace in Vlad Tepes era strikes a disturbing chord with the Wests' current threat (read Paul Fregosi's last book for a detailed and emotionally gripping exposition of the Ottoman incursions into Europe). A fascinating question – and if I ever get the chance to speak to Gary Shore (as if!) will be asking if it was intentional or just uncanny timing.Luke Evans elevates this film. The man has a big career ahead and I hope we get to see him ripping into serious drama roles.He brings a dark magnetism to every role, but here he is suitably epic, brooding and convincingly heroic. He imbues Vlad Tepes with pathos and grandeur despite an occasionally weak script. The other actors do well with the limited material. I felt Gadon was perfect for the role but like all the other support actors, was undercut by the brevity of the film. The anguish at her sons surrender to Hamza Bey was touching and of course she was set to perfection in velvet gowns and silks. I loved how Mirena's fall was a nod to 1992's River Princess scene where Elizabeta hurls herself from the Castle, but with a unique twist of it's own. Muting the background sound while a female singer's haunting notes pulled your heartstrings brilliant.The battle scenes are thrilling. I had to go back just to marvel at the monstrous tornado of vampire bats writhing and twisting in sync with Vlad fist before smashing into the Sultan's battalions. Dracula's first battle scene could easily have seemed absurd but Evan's and clever camera work pull it off. Dance is elegantly reptilian and that magisterial voice of his pity his screen time was so short.The sets and costumes are gorgeous. The Castle feast was well researched and looked authentic with Boyars, Guards and Monastics etc. It was like peering into a vanished world. There was one terrific little scene where 4 musicians break into a piece Slavic folk tune – I would love to know where they picked that element from.The scenes in the forest after Vlad's first draught of blood were original and clever with a dash of humour. Vlad's awe at his powers and a transformed perception of the world was a pleasure to watch.Dracula Untold delivers exactly what it promised. Big SCreen Fun.

462,ndcarter01,Special effects and movie concept well done,8,11 October 2014,"From the onset the movie gives the lead character (Dracula) a human quality that is often missing in many of previous story lines portraying Dracula. Yes, they all portray a monster but what makes this movie standout is the man before fully embodying a vampire, he displays caring that sacrifices all. Finally they special effects are excellent and gives the character a true superhuman quality that no other previous version could match, but at the same time not overwhelming the audience that too often is a problem with modern movies these days. I would have to compare this movie to the Hobbit for one genre similarities but also Luke Evens being a strong performer in both. I recommend watching.",Dracula Untold

I just finished watching Dracula Untold not even 30 minutes ago. I came straight home and immediately searched to see if a sequel will be made. Luke Evans plays a great role. I really enjoyed how they depicted Dracula in this storyline changing the whole meaning or thought of Dracula. I thought it was an Excellent movie and I enjoyed every minute of it.

I found that a lot of them were either romance or some horrific movie or hunting (whether its Dracula with human or Dracula with hunters) which was interesting but rather easy to guess what's going to happen. Storyline and its ending was totally different from those I've watched and made it more interesting. I love whole setting with some historical background added in movie. I was also pleased with the fact that this wasn't very horrific even during certain events in movie. There was quite number of kids in theater watching it with their parents so I found it rather neat. I waited for few months for this movie since I saw the trailer. It was worth waiting for me and I was happy that it was what I expected from trailer (I've saw movie that storyline was totally different from what seemed to happen on trailer and was disappointed once).

That's why the story comes to life, forget about Transylvania and all the wrong historical battle in this movie.I'm enjoying the characters of this movie, this movie should be in TV series like Spartacus. You will see the difference.What I don't like the most is the duration of the movie, how can you tell the story about Vlad in 90 minutes? Make 120 minutes movie, then we can enjoy the story.The character of Vlad is very good. Hope we have a very good sequel, just to make sure the story continues.",Dracula Untold
467,scottotis77,Awesome and very entertaining movie,10,13 October 2014,Me and my family loved this movie very much. We liked the little twist to the story of Dracula. The effects and the action is very good. Supported by a great cast such as Luke Evans and Charles Dance.I am not really sure what others were expecting from a fiction movie about blood sucking vampires. We did not go and watch this movie and think we was going to get a History lesson in Vlad 101. I gone and enjoyed the movie for what it was. A awesome vampire movie. I only wished it was a little bit longer of a movie.I hope there is a sequel and maybe covers the time period in between the jump in time to the present at the end of the movie.,Dracula Untold
468,pioneermanager,Dracula Untold left me wanting more,8,13 October 2014,"As with others I went into this movie with an open mind. I knew ahead of time it wasn't going to be like any other Dracula film put out there and this is what intrigued me. I wanted to know how they wove the history and Stoker's storyline in with their own. From what I have been able to research afterwards, they did a pretty good job, though there are going to be a lot of people whom are not going to agree since different regions have different histories regarding Vlad Tepes. Some saw him as a the monster Impaler, while many of his own people saw him as a war hero. There are a few reviewers knit-picking about the choice of history and location used. Get over it. Most people in the world know Transylvania more than they know about Wallachia, and you have to remember again, part of this story is based on Stoker's book and therefore it has to mesh. The movie does address the fact that Vlad was thought of as a warlord. That he killed thousands of innocent people and he felt nothing when doing it. The movie doesn't dwell on those facts, and you have to actually listen to the dialogue to catch the points. The visuals are spectacular, although at times they are far too fleeting. It would have been nice to see a few of these fleshed out more, including the bat swarm scene and the fight at the very end. I also noticed there were at least three scenes shown in the trailers which were cut out of the final film and I am hoping when the Bluray is released we get a Director's cut.The dialogue was thin. I haven't been able to decide if this might have been an editing issue or just poor scripting. The scene in which we are introduced to Vlad by the river I found to be awkward and had wished they focused on the helm and had a bit more to the conversation to carry it than having silence and the shot of the back of Vlad's head. I was also rather disappointed by the use of the same phrase by Dance twice in the film. It was rather jarring and left me confused.Again as others have stated, most of the supporting characters were forgettable or left me wondering what their motivation was, especially one particular ""advisor"" to Vlad in the end. The storyline was very interesting, though fast paced. I completely saw where they were going with the primary story, but I also saw massive potential for where they could take future films. I wish I had seen more of Dance's character, as it intrigued me most and I felt he was the prime antagonist in this movie, not Copper's Mehmed, who came across more like a spoiled Prince than a warlord. I wished however, that I had seen more of how Vlad's decision affected his family, particularly Merina. I am hoping whomever writes the sequel(s) truly explores Dance's character's evil and manipulations, and Vlad's struggle and loss to the evil within. Luke Evans as Vlad shone in this film. You could see and feel the pain and struggle he was going through as you watched, despite the lack of dialogue. He did the best with what he had to work with. Charles Dance also stood out spectacularly as the Master Vampire, and left me wanting to know more and see just how evil he really is. Despite the storyline being fast paced and lacking in a few areas, and missing dialogue this movie accomplished what it was meant to. I was entertained and I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Had they had a bit more of those two things and slowed the action scenes down a wee bit, I would have given this film a 10/10.I suggest, if you are still wavering on seeing it and don't like the fact it is not a traditional Dracula film like Coppola's version, to read the sequel to Stoker's book written by his son Dacre Stoker. I think it may give people more insight to how his original Dracula character was meant to be portrayed, compared to what we have been given over the years. I can't wait for more.",Dracula Untold
469,monkeystuff1990,Well done,9,13 October 2014,"I have seen a good deal of commentary on this movie thrashing it as ""historically inaccurate"" or ""too fast"". To the first: who cares? How many movies have used extreme license in the use of historical places, people, equipment, and methods yet turn out fantastically in the box office? Usually, this is due to inane, over-the-top aspects. 300 comes to mind. If we're going to nitpick, Vlad Tepes was known for a rather different mechanic of impaling than is depicted in the film. To the second: Perhaps. But how many more three hour long movies can we endure on a regular basis? Does Dracula (the fictional character) deserve such a movie? Fans might think so. However, the succinct nature of the movie, and the transition to a possible sequel, were both to its credit. Much like a reader does not often seek accuracy in their fiction, the viewer must allow the license; even if it is more stark because nothing is left to imagination.Pros: Excellent effects, without excess Rather original in story (i.e. Dracula backstory) Good pace Good action Demeanor of cast = near-perfectCons: Improper impaling (It IS what he was known for). Insufficient demonstration of extent of characters powers (variety). Second generation vampire???",Dracula Untold
470,smi10021,The Somewhat Told Story of Dracula,8,13 October 2014,"I am a great fan of vampire legends (bypassing what is now an over abundance of sparkling, moody immortal youths), but also of literature and history. The bestselling novel ""The Historian"" is based off of fact and fiction, where the author gives us Vlad's true story, but with a twist: he eventually sold his soul to wreak vengeance on the Ottoman Empire and the rest of the world. It is my favorite book, actually, so I was delighted when this film began delving deeper into the true story. There are shaky points, of course. Ingeras tells us at the film's end that the Turks ""never conquered the capitals of Europe"", which is not true. Vlad was eventually wiped out, hated by all, and his head was a trophy upon the Sultan's gates. So was Dracula completely told? Not really. But the film offers one heck of a viewing experience. It fluctuates from fantasy to horror to action and back to dark. I have already seen it three times by now, and I love it more and more each time. There is a tremendous depth to the characters, and you truly care for their welfare. I went the second time with my friend and her husband, and they said how deeply touched they were by Vlad and his wife's relationship. Luke and Sarah were incredible. I cry each time she falls to her death... and my heart breaks when Vlad lifts his head to the sky, howling in agony. Beautiful performance by Charles Dance. Incredible action and delicious for all vampire fans! Must see!!",Dracula Untold
471,tre0727,Great Prelude of a classic story,7,14 October 2014,I went into this film with no expectations that it be grand or terrible. I did go in to see a classic genre of film that has been diluted with sparkling teen heart throbs made for a new generation (not that those are terrible just not classic). I enjoyed seeing Luke Evans play a character that I must admit he was born to play. He truly embodied the type of person that the writers portrayed Vlad to be. Like many have said I do wish the movie was longer to fully highlight his past as Vlad. It is likely that the sequel will so somewhat of a backstory to show us who he was & his thought process in becoming Dracula since it appears Master V & he were having a convo none of us were privy to. My other hang up was the fact he had no control over those he sired--this can't be! That detail at the very climatic end could've destroyed the movie. But all in all there was great action & introduction of characters that felt like a prelude to a classic begging to be reborn. Keep Luke Evans & develop this further & you can have a great classic franchise!,Dracula Untold
472,shasha1245,Vampires are cool again.,9,15 October 2014,"This movie was great, actually made vampires out to be dangerous and scary.I have read the original Dracula book and several biographies on Vlad The Impaler. This movie put together the historical person and the fictional Dracula in a way that pleased the nerdy history dork and the horror movie fan in me. Not a movie to see if you are looking to be freaked out, but if you want to a movie that doesn't have vampires sparkling see this movie.Excellent twist to an old story and cannot wait for the next one. On a side note this movie has great special effects which really made vampires seem cool again. Unlike the twilight movies that just made vampires seem lame.",Dracula Untold
473,xtrm-gamer,Enjoy it for what it is,7,15 October 2014,"May contain Spoilers First off, I'm laughing at the people who are hurt and mad that this isn't true to the ""historical"" account of Vlad and/or Dracula and the Turks. Its their take on how Dracula became a Vampire (one of many different views on how Dracula and Vampires came to be in Hollywood). It used historical names and events to add a sense of credence to the story but its not meant to be a true to life documentary. So if you did know a little bit about Vlad's actual history than you could relate a little more to the story, but it isn't needed to enjoy the film.If the film itself was about 30 minutes longer to take time to develop the story and characters a little more than it could have been a fantastic movie. Its still worth watching and enjoyable but feels rushed. The CGI was fantastic and the fight scenes were great but too short (again felt rushed). Luke Evans played a great Vlad, the script and story didn't do him justice. To me he carried the film along with the CGI. Had the other characters been developed then it would have balanced out a lot more. It isn't a horror film but more of a fantasy action movie. So if you like fantasy action movies and don't expect historical accuracies and aren't offended by Dracula not being THE Dracula from the original novel then this is a good Friday night watch or rent.",Dracula Untold

The acting was superb and I can't wait to see a sequel with the rest of the story! As it turns out, many of the negative reviews surrounding this concern the historical facts, etc. To this, I'd say this is not a documentary ... it does not claim to be based on a true story ... and do we get upset if the fish in our aquariums don't behave as depicted in Finding Nemo??

475,benji_forrest,A great adaptation of a classic story,8,12 July 2015,"Bram Stoker's tale of Dracula is already a famous cinematic title and the ability to create an adaptation that creates a new look is hard. However that is just what has been done here. In many of the versions, Dracula is already the feared vampire and the story takes place wherever his anarchy takes him. However in this version we see how Dracula became the dreaded vampire and master of evil. The story has audiences on the edge of the seat especially when his son is ripped from him and taken to fight for the Turkish empire. The fight of a father to protect his family creates much of the emotional journey in the film and powers the film through to his embodiment of the demon. The need to protect his kingdom, people and family is something that everyone can relate to, but how far would you go to do this?A great cinematic picture that goes hand in hand with a great score by Ramin Djawadi, a composer that I will be listening to a lot more now.",Dracula Untold

478,michaelaford395,Dracula Untold (2014),5,28 October 2014,"Special effects can make or break a movie. In Dracula Untold (2014), the special effects were the only thing working in its favor. The special effects and make up resemble movies such as Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia. The main character is Vlad. His kingdom is threatened by Turks. Vlad makes the decision to become a monster (vampire) by drinking the Mater Vampire's blood. He does this in order to get the power he needs to protect his family and his kingdom. This movie was basically an adaptation of all other vampire movies. It was very unoriginal and historically incorrect. It was supposed to be an adaptation of Bram Stocker's Dracula, but through narrative problems and execution, it didn't make sense. There were parts of the story that was lacking and left questions. The audience doesn't even find out the name of Vlad's wife Mirena until she dies. There was the use of deus ex machine to fill some of the plot gaps. When Mirena falls to her death she is somehow still alive and able to tell Vlad to drink her blood. The plot also follows a Greek tragedy theme. It states ""a good but flawed man will become tangled in events that will prove to be his ruin"". However, this leads to the theme of good versus evil while still leaving you wondering who is good and who is evil. It is unclear is Vlad is good because of what he does for his son, or evil because he fails to protect his people. The runtime was around 90 minutes long which made the plot feel even more rushed to end with the movie. Nevertheless, the last few minutes of the movie left the audience with more questions and a possible sequel ending the dialogue with Master Vampire saying, ""let the games begin"". I would give this movie a 5/10. It was only interesting to watch because of the special effects and cinematography.",Dracula Untold
479,didemv,awful,1,29 October 2014,It is the worst movie I have ever seen. They have no idea about the Ottoman Empire. They never acted like that to women in this way. The Sultan's life and his acts also are lies. It is a shame for history. I invite these film producers to read the history in detail. Everything was awful. It is also a shame for the Dracula story. He did not live like that in the story. I don't recommend this movie. One vote is even too much for this movie. Fight scenes were not real. Dracula's wife didn't die like this. It is not also possible to kill that much men even for Dracula. The end was awful too. I want to give 0 to this disgusting thing...,Dracula Untold
480,kenzahra91,loved it,9,2 November 2014,"I'll give it a nine. It's different than d other vampire franchise. I Think, it's the setting that actually made this movie stand out, and It turns to be a good movie. The history of Vlad, most of them were true. Though the part where he became a vampire and the part that he's a caring and loving husband were actually just a fiction. But well, it's an entertainment and u have to put some drama sometimes, and i still love it though... so much better than d other vampire movie, even the underworld franchise (and i worshiped d underworld franchise BTW). I like it how Luke portrayed Vlad, he's born to became vampire i think, his acting even his canines was perfect. And about the ending, it's interesting how the film made it as if it's not end yet, when the master of vampire appear and said ""let's the game begin"". So i think it'll trigger the fans curiosity about what will happen next with Vlad and his reincarnate wife Nina. And if it's true that they'll make the sequel i hope the script writer and the producer & director really need to work hard to make the sequel outstanding like the first one.",Dracula Untold
481,lbushey729,Special Effects > Plot Holes,6,3 November 2014,"Dracula Untold (2014), directed by Gary Shore, left viewers with a handful of questions; mostly left behind by plot holes you could fit your fist through. Perhaps the best thing about medieval vampire movies is that because vampires aren't real (spoiler alert) there really is a lot of wiggle room for how a plot can be made. While there were some gaps in logic, the writers of Dracula Untold have to be given credit for their creativity and persistence in being different. Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (credits also given to Bram Stoker for the characters) attempted to give the ""untold"" story of Dracula by making him a family man that kills in front of his son, creating the original vampire to be an otherwise friendly guy to meet in a cave, and basically infecting all of Transylvania with vampirism. This film is a classic tale of hubris riddled with bats and the Turkish Empire. Besides a question here and there I can't help but be amazed by the visual appeal of this film, the special effects were some of the best I have seen in recent movies. I can only imagine the time spent on the visual effects that gave audience an actual feel of vampire powers; green screen background/set design was beautiful, as well as the costumes and makeup. Cinematographic value is hard to interpret, being that most scenes were digital, however wide landscape shots and low key lighting held true to medieval tale depiction. Dracula Untold took a brave path by trying to re-create a classic theme, the holes in the plot were possibly left by a sequel that is stewing. The story may be lackluster and rather empty, however I would give this film a solid 6 stars out of 10 due to the stunning effects and sheer talent it took to put the classic vampire-thriller aside. My prediction: a sequel is in the works and would definitely be worth seeing.",Dracula Untold

Its like trying to ""understand"" and sympathize with Hitler.2) Bits of the movie not adding up.. namely the fact that the Turkish emperor guy just suddenly knew exactly how to deal with Vlad via silver and a stake through the heart. Wtf? So just before their 'confrontation' the Turks all ""oh my men are scared about you there's rumours going around about you.."" BUT THEN all of a sudden hes like some vamp expert knowing Vlads exact weaknesses. Chyeah right.3)The ending. dafuq? Im all for cliffhangers but this was just too ???.... So hes just suddenly in the 21st century. It leaves a lot of questions...did he have a relationship with his son? How the hell does he find an exact replica of his wife...?

I finally watched it and I must say, never was I so disappointed in a movie before. Let me tell you why.Before criticizing it, I will give the few credits to this movie that it deserves:The CGI was pretty smooth and created exciting battlefield atmosphere with Dracula.Now to the contra:The historical facts in this movie are so false, that it hurt my ears and eyes while watching it. You can google Vlad III or Faith Sultan Mehmed and it will take you roughly 2minutes to read about the battle they fought and the outcome. The movie shows the total opposite! I do of course not know why the regisseur decided to make a movie based on totally false history. It might be due to his personal ""hate"" against Turks? Or maybe he just didn't care and tried to put it as authentical as he could by not putting ANY effort in researching the historical background? Nobody knows. But what I do know is that it is very lousy!IF you do not care about history, then leave the history part out. Just make a movie about Dracula and some random guys he is fighting, entertain your audience with CGI (which was obviously well done) and with other qualities.What bothers me the most about the false historical information is that some people, with little to zero historical background in this topic, will go watch the movie, and believe what they just saw. They will have totally wrong picture of the world and the Turks/Ottomans. Kids might even generate hate against them. Especially in the US.It is not only wrong to use non-researched historical background, but also dangerous. Very poor from the regisseur. Very poor.Thats why, this movie deserves not more than 1 Star.

If its creators wanted to ""display"" one of the legends about Vlad Tepes then I conclude (based on other comments, like the one about turks' swords not being curved) that the source of information is full of bs. From my understanding, a legend is a story where the details and some of its subjects are real (i.e. the swords are curved) but the facts were not necessary real.

488,Othurlby1,Quite simply: average,4,11 December 2014,"I have seen several reviews claiming that this is the best Dracula film ever made. Ridiculous. There is very little character development of any sort and the storyline is predictable and lacks any ability to grasp the viewer and fully immerse them. Its like an old story on steroids...: unfortunately these steroids have brought about some serious side effects. The direction is fairly one dimensional, and this ties in with the predictability of the film. Some of the camera shots were borderline hilarious and were the sort of thing I expect in a comedy. However that being said, the way the film (spoiler) travels full circle and ends in a similar way to which it starts is quite charming. The passion behind Dracula's actions is a refreshing twist on the well-known story and gave some real reason for why he became a vampire. One final thing that annoyed me in this film was the extent of Dracula's powers. It became a bit pointless, there was no peril, no danger. It all became a bit too easy. The director chose to create a Hollywood vampire god that became virtually indestructible. Could have gone a different route but unfortunately didn't.Overall an average film that perhaps lacked some character development and needed to be a little less predictable.

I think that the directors and the script writers did an excellent job writing a different side to the Dracula story. So, for those who care about the chronicles of Dracula and close their mind to a different story don't watch this movie. But, if you're looking for a fun fiction story this is a fantastic movie.

The actor knows how to act and handle to situation. This movie is highly recommended. I hope there is a sequel episode for it. There is a part a movie that gives you a sadness because the he was not able to save his own wife. Tsk tsk. Hoping for more sequel with that kind of title. Dracula Untold has a nice print and good enough of effects. I wonder because the old vampire has only few roles in the movie.,Dracula Untold
493,dragonborn9,It's very good!,9,22 December 2014,"loved the movie. Liked the idea that director have put in it. But in fact they made character of Dracula as sacrificing Angel or similar. Kind, polite and noble person. And it's Turkish Khan, who turned Vlad into scary and cruel murdered/warrior/Impaler. That's what i liked, it's something new. But there was a frustrating mistake i guess. No matter how powerful and strong Vlad became after transformation into vampire, he just couldn't kill and beat many thousands Turkish army. All the rest was good. Off course it's not Dracula by Francis Ford Coppola, i can't even compare these two movies, but Dracula untold wasn't bad.",Dracula Untold
494,wayneh10,Excellent movie good twist on the original,8,8 May 2020,Enjoyed the happier beginnings of Dracula & not the usual evil villain we've all grown up to know.,Dracula Untold
495,pisiata,I loved it!,10,15 January 2015,"1st of all i have read lots of books about Vlad the Impaler/Dracula because it always fascinated me. Even so, before to watch the movie i expected to be different and i accepted the new fantasy story. Strange thing is, why it has a bad note? Why people always want either the real truth or something only their mind can create/imagine? Luke plays FABULOUS, special effects are awesome, too bad it was only 90 min ""long"". And i don't really get why Turkish people make such a big deal from it. (PS: i got Turkish blood from my dad). IT IS REAL that sultan Mehmed II asked tribute in money and young children recruits for his army. IT IS REAL that Ottoman Empire did lots of harm to Europe wanting to conquest and conquest further. IT IS REAL that Vlad was very wise and skillful, and if he preferred to impale his enemies, he have learned that at the Ottoman court. IF he was cruel, he HAS TO BE! HE WAS STRONG,BRAVE, never surrendering. In those HARSH BARBARIC times it was needed to be ""evil"" so if he wouldn't be so, wouldn't live not even 10 min at the Ottoman court or after that period.",Dracula Untold
496,JamesXPateX,Such a great movie,8,21 January 2015,"I really enjoyed this movie. It shows a different side of Dracula that I have not seen before. It may not be historically correct but its a movie. Fictional. And with that in mind this was probably one of the best movies I've watched this year. It was relatively short but they did a fantastic job of not rushing the movie. I highly recommend watching this, great action thriller. It was awesome seeing the powers that a vampire has and the CGI does a really good job at portraying what he was capable of. I was on edge half of the movie wondering what was going to happen next, and honestly I was not disappointed one bit. I really hope that they decide to make Dracula Untold 2 and follow up on what happens next.",Dracula Untold
497,dcblanton93,Had potential but...,5,9 February 2015,"I don't know anything about the history so that part didn't get to me so much. It just seemed like a typical action movie, too many parts that are so unrealistic it's laughable...seriously? A woman falls from a cliff or wherever the heck she is and doesn't die immediately from impact.And then on top of all this stupidity that could have been avoided if they took the time to perfect their story, why on earth would he keep waiting for his enemy to arrive practically at his front door? You are a one man army sir! Move your butt to them. if you actually wanted to save your people You wouldn't let them set foot near them, they clearly are not equipped to fight a war which annoyed me. But it really did have potential the fighting scenes and graphics were pretty good I must say, I just think like most movies these days they don't perfect their movies details before rushing into production.",Dracula Untold
498,agelos1999,"Great movie , leave history out of this .",9,11 February 2015,"So , i watched the movie with reasonable expectations , and in fact , the movie overcame them . If you want to watch a movie about history , go watch a documentary or , a historically accurate film , so i think this movie shouldn't be judged based on historical terms . The length was a problem , but wow , did the acting make up for it . Luke Evans game an amazing performance , and managed to do what an actor should always do , make you feel sympathy , or anger against them , as did Dominic Cooper. Overall the movie was action packed , and in my opinion , really fun ! . It does NOT contain almost any true historical facts , but i didn't care ,as i said , the movie is neither a historical one ,nor a thriller . Great movie to watch with friends , 9/10 because of the length which could have added even more depth to the plot and characters ,and also the last 'final' fight sequence .",Dracula Untold
499,rhoni-245-667143,Amazing film!!!,9,22 February 2015,"I absolutely loved this film!! It's fast paced, enjoyable and fun to watch. The costume design and graphics were outstanding. I would recommend this film to all of my friends and family without a second thought. The plot was perfect and Luke Evans as Vlad was incredible. His first film where he is the main character and he smashed it!! The only downside (which is why I gave it 9 stars) is that the film is only 92 minutes long. So at times it seems like it was rushed a little. I would have liked to see Vlad a little more as a human personally, the relationship with this wife and child in more depth .. And maybe his transition that bit slower ... But hey it was still the best movie I have seen last year!! Plus there were some inconsistencies with the sun and what have you but I can over look those because the rest of the film could not be faulted!! The annoying thing is that people can give this film a low star score because they see Dracula in the title and assume it will be another Dracula movie and then get disappointed when it's not. It's the Untold story of Dracula .. An origin story .. You will do well to remember that people :)",Dracula Untold
500,jkscn,Much to think about,9,16 March 2015,"Considering what he does to save his family and his kingdom... the movie breathes a different light into an otherwise dark story. Thought Luke Evans did a great job and was certainly believable jointly as a prince, husband, father, friend and survivor. Sarah Gadon did an awesome job as his wife and made the ultimate sacrifice when necessary. Although other actors were familiar, the movie did a good job of keeping focused on the main characters. Thought the sultan's character was a complete wimp when it came time for their battle. Although bloody at times, it was certainly not as gory as other Dracula movies in the past. The ending was a somewhat pleasant surprise.",Dracula Untold
501,nathan_rossiter,A refreshing and exciting portrayal of a heavily told story,10,9 September 2016,"Dracula Untold delivers all the right elements of Dracula to feed the familiar but also brought with it a well-bodied tale of human virtues, conflict, love and betrayal.Enthralling right from the start with the right balance of depth and action. Some well-designed scenes to impress, and an excellent character building by Luke Evans (Vlad) that is hard to not be drawn into. The capturing performance by Luke gives this film life, where he effortlessly commands the dramatic and action genres and left me to question ""who is this actor and why am I not familiar with him?""The movie leaves with it some insatiable cravings from the unfamiliar plot lines, and an intense desire for a sequel.",Dracula Untold
502,rbkeith,Time for a sequel,8,14 April 2019,I hope that people put pen to paper and start to put together a sequel ...To be honest one of the better Dracula movies,Dracula Untold
503,superblastnz,A good fiction movie.,8,30 August 2015,"To all who complain the facts are not correct, please let me remind you, Dracula is not a real person, sure there was a Vlad but be assured he did not suck blood from peoples necks, he did not fly, also sunlight did not burn him to a crisp.If you want to watch a documentary about Dracula please do but do not assume a fictional story is anything but a fictional story.Also there is no Superman, Batman, X-men etc.Overall a good action movie which i recommend to all who do not want to watch a documentary. I found a refreshing story line with great special effects, sure it is a a standard bad v good type movie but are they not the best type when made properly. I do find it hard to believe certain reviews expect more accuracy needed when it it is but a story.Watch it and enjoy it for what it is....",Dracula Untold
504,wheelessa,Looking over history's timeline and other bad reviews,9,8 May 2021,"This was a good movie. I was skeptical at first because of the poor reviews. But I saw a review that made sense, so I decided to watch it. Movies don't need to be based on true historical events. Other reviews say Dracula isn't in this movie. The main character becomes Dracula to save his son. Very good plot and graphics.",Dracula Untold
505,wsizzle,A movie that utterly took me for a surprise!,9,11 October 2015,"I absolutely love this movie. I have watched it 5 times now and still am thrilled to watch this film. I do believe that you couldn't find a better actor for the main character. He always delivers a solid performance and that has not wavered in this film. In my opinion the full cast were exceptional and I absolutely love the romantic true love story involved. I have not seen a Dracula movie that I have enjoyed more. That includes Bram Strokes Dracula as well as Interview with a Vampire which is also another great movie. I hope there is a sequel because it deserves it. Besides, I want to see ""the games begin."" I would rate it a perfect score but it was too short and I just want more. Again the acting or should I say the cast worked perfectly. And at my age of 33, I have watched all the vampire movies. Again, this is my favorite and I want more. Please make more and keep the cast! Acting was amazing!!",Dracula Untold
506,tiarahps,"The story, who have to corrected",6,28 November 2015,"About the story i think it's a little sad to say if this story inspired from prince Wallachia, Vlad III Dracula who known as a cruel-brutal king from Rumania. In the history Vlad III Dracula defeated by Turk. And in this movie Turk knight clearly defined as the person who like massacring/decimating. My friend has told me if Sultan Mehmed II is Muslim (Islam) and in Islam forbidden to massacring/decimating citizen who not count as a knight. And what about Vlad III Dracula wife, why in the movie she died 'cause pushed by Turk soldier while in the history she died 'cause suicide. My suggestion if you want to make a movie related to or inspired from history, though not directly you must see the truly about in reality. So i give 4/10 'cause the story about. And 6/10 in all 'cause the background effect like The Lord of The Rings, and when he change to a bat.",Dracula Untold
507,darknovasfs,An Amazing film regardless if you like history or not,9,20 June 2017,"I absolutely adore this film and would recommend this to everyone. I find it extremely insulting that various critics act like this movie is a holy cross warding off the History fans like we are evil monsters hiding in the darkness. I was a former History major and learned all about the Ottoman Empire, probably more than any of you other critics ever learned. The Ottoman's were a horrible evil empire that invaded most of Europe but were ultimately stopped by Vlad and pushed back, eventually leading to their complete defeat as well as collapse in World War I (WWI). No one seems to ever care to learn about the Ottomans in terms of Europe invading great powers, often preferring to think of Napolean and Rome and the Nazi's but the Ottomans were also a major conquering power. They were once formed with the hope of uniting the Mid East, not created to be a force of evil yet their purpose became twisted over the years.Dracula is a fictional character that was created as a story book character inspired by the legend of Vlad the Impaler. If you are a real history fan you know all of this, if you are not a history fan don't lie and pretend you are one.I still believe tying this fictional character and the man inspired by him, tying them together, was a beautiful creative unique idea. Vlad sadly is mostly known only for inspiring the creation of Dracula, why not connect the two further?In terms of the film, Charles Dance does an outstanding job in this film as well as Luke Evans. I would say easily this is my favorite film with these two actors. I would also say this is one of my favorite vampire movies i have ever seen.I cannot express enough this does NOT follow the traditional story book tale of Dracula. He's not some arrogant lady's man seducing women tricking them drinking their blood and being the ultimate night hunter of women. If you look to Dracula and see only that, then you won't be happy. I personally like this version of Dracula better, i feel as if it makes the character more real and easier to relate with. I have watched this movie hundreds of times and will continue to watch it again and again in the future. I do not say it is a guilty pleasure as it is one of the best dark Gothic/ monster movies i have ever seen and to me guilty pleasure would be a film truly bad (many for instance debate the Transformers films as being very bad). Dracula Untold is simply a fantastic movie and deeply enjoyable.I guess if this movie has any problems, you don't really understand Vlad's commanders or the Sultan, their motives are very thin however i would say most of the movie's strength lies on Vlad and his family plus some amazing star power with Charles Dance as the master vampire. This movie is severely underrated.",Dracula Untold
508,thewolfman-10773,Not a 10 but a solid 8,8,16 May 2016,"Dracula Untold is a constantly critiqued but more often underrated film. It is by no means perfect and has a slightly underdeveloped plot, but it ties very well into the novel through certain steps along the way. The acting is no less than stellar and the color form or the film work is also very well done. I hope to see the sequel. Some of the film's characters are underdeveloped especially the supporting characters and the history of vampires is lacking, but the focus on the main character and his family doesn't draw enough from the main story to make it a bad movie. Why everyone seems to be so harsh on this movie is beyond me because I feel it definitely fits the monster movie genre even if it's not the horror movie genre.",Dracula Untold

511,strofacecary,Fantastic!,10,12 March 2017,"I love Dracula since I was a little girl and have always been obsessed. Dracula Untold exceeded all expectations. It was suspenseful and with a well explained plot, no getting lost in this story. Luke Evans did a fantastic job of playing the role and being easy on the eyes doesn't hurt. I really do hope they consider filming a part 2 after leaving us all thinking there would be with the ending in the movie. I have watched it more times than i can count at this point and am very disappointed to still hear they have no news on whether or not they will make a part two. If you want action (lots), suspense, and love this is the movie. It has it all! PLEASE MAKE A PART 2!!!!!!!",Dracula Untold
512,amixaili,Reminded me of later Castlevania video games,9,1 April 2017,"Before i watch the movie i had seen very mediocre critics but i was quite anxious to watch it even from the first time i watched the trailer. The movie was like watching a resent Castlevania video game. For that reason it did very good. I quite enjoyed the movie. Bad votes probably from those unfamiliar with the games, so maybe they didn't know what they were watching. It is a movie i'd like to watch again.",Dracula Untold

516,erdeilui,Rate your life and this movie more...,10,5 April 2018,"Although most people would not agree with me, i think this movie is sadly underrated.It is sad that people think some Eternal values are corny, like these:
the importance of One's family and the duty of protecting itthe relationship of parent and child, like protection from the parent side and full trust from children
protection and self-sacrifice for other people who all entrusted you with their lives or simply just hinder the evil around youthe Eternal love, admiring your partner amidst in the middle of crazy chaos
 with vibrant happiness surrounding them like an invisible force and protecting shield almost sparklingthe sanctity of the given word and promises, breaking them equals with slow death of the soulthe Eternal struggle of good and evil, where lines between the sides are blurred. It's uncertain how far One can go without crossing the line. Once crossed the border, can One remain good, and return?You can find all of the things above in this movie.
Special thank to the cast, who willy or unwittingly lived and portrayed these feelings and shared with us. I give it a 10 stars and looking forward to more other movies like this. About heroes, ordinary ""every day"" heroes, good and bad One's who could cross their boundaries so typical to our world today.They don't look for the easy way out, capable of brave sacrifice because of selflessness.
Because they know they are not the important thing in this world.Nowadays , where everyone locks themselves into their own world and bad things gain ground.The power of good is in the community,getting together and helping each other out.You don't need to protect yourself you need to protect others.Others will take care of you and they can protect you better than yourself, because they are many more.We can't reach this alone, nor without care about eachother.So this is all are in this movie. If you don't aggree with me, watch it again, and again.Not for me, but for you, for your family, for all of humanity, or the Earth...for the whole Universe.Supported by Eternal values.",Dracula Untold
