0,SnoopyStyle,a new voice,7,31 October 2018,"Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield) is struggling to get by. He lives in the garage rental in his uncle's house. His girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson) is an artist. He gets a telemarketing job. The pay is poor and commission is hard to come by until his co-worker Langston (Danny Glover) teaches him his White Voice. The best operators get promoted to be Power Callers upstairs. Co-worker Squeeze (Steven Yeun) is battling management to form an union. In the world, Steve Lift (Armie Hammer) is the mercurial CEO of WorryFree, a company which controls every aspect of its workers' lives.This is debut writing/directing from musician Boots Riley. It's a great first attempt and a new voice delivering something fresh. There are new ideas and new visuals. The story takes unusual turns but still says something coherent with a biting satire. I even like the surprise horse reveal. The only part bothering me is the abrupt change in Green's personality. The change needs to be more graduate. It's a character study gone wrong. The most problematic is his heated argument with his friend on the picket line. It's wrong in many ways and wrong in story writing. Otherwise, I love the fresh vision of this filmmaker.",Sorry to Bother You
1,boblipton,Complicity And Victimhood,5,5 November 2021,"Lakeith Stanfield really needs a job. He gets one as a telemarketer. What is he selling? It doesn't matter; just stick to the script. It's Danny Glover who explains how to make the sales: use his white voice. By that, he means his I-don't-really-need-this-I-was-just-on-the-way-to-my-yacht voice, and soon he's racking up the sales and promoted to the next floor, where they make the real money, just as a strike breaks out to organize the workers.It's up there that he discovers what he's selling up there: the new slavery, where people live, eat, sleep and work in a small space, making whatever Armie Hammer can get a contract to manufacture for a half the price that Asian laborers will accept. But Hammer wants him for his ability to sell something even worse...It's an interesting personal story. Suppose you go through life, not being good at anything, and suddenly you find something you are very good at; indeed, you're the best there is. However, it's being used for a wrong purpose? Stanfield plays his character appropriately as a nebbish, some one who walks hunched over and has nothing to say, even though his beautiful girlfriend, a crazy performance artist, tells him he's very interesting that way -- probably, I thought, because she can can dominate him so totally. So that part of it is a straw man argument.The second question: ""How can this movie show this sort of stuff, while when Spike Lee does it, everyone screams?"" I've thought about it and have concluded that it's because Lee makes Black people complicit in their own debasement in movies like CHI-RAq and BAMBOOZLED and yes, even in DO THE RIGHT THING, where it's Spike Lee himself who sets off the riot over a pair of shoes. In this movie, poor people are oppressed through no fault of their own, even though Stanfield rises through ability and his girlfriend is happy to accept the trapping of wealth that his success brings; she also looks forward to selling her art about Africa to rich White people. The telemarketers want a living wage, when they have been offered a commission on sales; and so forth.I doubt very much that most of the audience will see this other side of the coin. Nor are they supposed to. All they will see is rich stereotype Armie Hammer snorting coke and asking Stanfield to rap.",Sorry to Bother You
2,Prismark10,The shape of things to come,6,20 August 2019,"I can see Sorry to Bother You ranked as a cult classic in future years. We live in an era where future job security is at risk from AI, robots and drones. The films asks important questions. The answers though are unpalatable. Workhouses for future workers unless they are part of the elite.Sorry to Bother You starts out as a satire on race. Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield) gets a telemarketing job and is struggling just to stick with the script. Cassius is in debt and is living at his uncle's garage. His uncle is behind on his mortgage payments so he could lose his house.His fellow black colleague Langston (Danny Glover) tells Cassius that he will get more sales for using his 'White Voice.' Once Cassius adopts this, his sales hits the roof and pretty soon he is on his way to the top floor to become a power caller and more money. Meanwhile his fellow workers are on the picket line for better working conditions.On the top floor, Cassius finds himself working to sell services from WorryFree to the highest bidder. WorryFree guarantees folks employment, housing and food for life. However in reality it is slavery, the food is slop and the housing is prison like cells. They work long and hard for whichever corporation takes on WorryFree staff.However this is not enough for Steve Lift (Armie Hammer) the young chief executive of WorryFree. He plans to have a low cost workforce that can work harder and longer. He is not horsing about.What starts out as a social satire quickly morphs as a surreal attack on modern capitalism. Governments and corporations do not give a damn if the populace are modern slaves, only profits count.As for Cassius, he bends his principles when he starts to make huge commissions. He turns his back on his striking friends and splits with his activist girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson.)First time director Boots Riley shows his inexperience in film making, its message gets chaotic and muddled. Yet it is a daring and absurd debut.",Sorry to Bother You
3,nogodnomasters,Use your white voice,6,15 November 2018,"Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield) cash-is-green lives in his uncle's garage with his girlfriend. He recently got a job as a telemarketer but can't make a sale unless he uses his ""white voice."" His goal is to be a power caller, ride the gold elevator and make the big money. Meanwhile, there is a company called ""Worryfree"" which has workers sign lifetime contracts for three squares and a cot, i.e. legalized slavery.The film is an Orwellian/Swift satire of society that wasn't well focused. It made points but failed to capitalize on its potential, by not creating a big picture. Was it about black people who sell out their race and act white, or was it about wage slaves? or temps? Is it about people who are willing to swap freedom for security? It seemed to be all that and more.Guide: F-word, sex, brief nudity.",Sorry to Bother You
4,kosmasp,Don't sweat it,10,3 October 2019,"Every so often a movie comes around, then really gets you to go ""woah"". And this is one of those movies. I have no idea how the filmmaker came up with all the things he shows us here. And it is tough to describe overall, because this is a movie that takes on the establishment and society and our view on class system and also has something to say about those calls you get, where a stranger tries to sell you something.It's also about race (the ""rap"" is almost too cringe-worthy and should make you equal parts uncomfortable while kind of make you smile too) and other things. And it does have a fantastic cast to support all the strange thngs that are depicted in the movie. I can't praise the movie enough for being different. This really delivers on its premise and what else could you ask for? It may not touch any of your senses, it may not be to your liking, but it is masterfully crafted (flaws included)",Sorry to Bother You
5,jboothmillard,Sorry to Bother You,4,20 March 2020,"I almost went to the cinema to this film, I knew it was something to do with cold calling, and who hasn't been a victim of that? Then I found out it was a new entry in the latest edition of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was definitely going to be watching it. Basically, set in a parallel universe of present-day Oakland, California, Cassius ""Cash"" Green (Get Out's LaKeith Stanfield) with his girlfriend, artist Detroit (Men in Black: International's Tessa Thompson), in the garage of his uncle Sergio (Terry Crews). Struggling to pay rent, Cash manages to get commission paid job as a telemarketer for RegalView. Cash has trouble talking to customers, predominately white people over the phone. Older co-worker Langston (Danny Glover) tells him he will get more clients if he learns to use his ""white voice"" instead of his African American style of speaking. Langston demonstrates with the use of his own white voice (voice of Steve Buscemi). Cash unintentionally demonstrates ""white voice"" (voice of David Cross), which stuns people. He employs the voice whilst speaking to customers on the phone, and soon excels. Co-worker Squeeze (Steven Yeun) forms a trade union, and Cash, Detroit, and their friend Salvador ""Sal"" (Jermaine Fowler). Cash expects to be fired when he joins a protest group called Left Eye, but instead he is promoted to an elite Power Caller position. In his luxurious Power Caller suite, Cash is told always to use his white voice, and learns that RegalView secretly sells arms and slave labour from the corporation WorryFree. Cash is initially uncomfortable with the job, but he can afford a new car and apartment and pays off Sergio's house and his own rent. Working long hours, he stops participating in the union push and his relationship with Detroit deteriorates. An incident between Cash and a group of picketers is filmed and becomes an internet meme. Cash is invited to a party with WorryFree CEO Steve Lift (Armie Hammer). The crowd goaded him into rapping, and the only thing they respond to positively is repeated racist language. During the evening, Lift offers Cash a white powdered substance, Cash snorts it, believing it is cocaine. Looking for the bathroom, Cash is shocked to discover a shackled half-horse, half-human hybrid begging him for help. Lift is unsurprised by his discovery and shows him a video about what is going on. Lift explains that WorryFree plans to make many workers these creatures, known as ""equisapiens"", a stronger and more obedient work force. The transformation happens when the human subject snorts the white gene-modifying powder. Cash panics that he has just snorted the substance, but Lift assures him it was cocaine. Cash refuses a $100 million offer over five years to become an equisapien and act as a false revolutionary figure to keep the employees in line. Cash discovers he dropped his phone and recorded a video of his encounter and the plea of the creature. To spread the video, Cash appears on television talk and discussion shows. He even endures the humiliating games and beating on the extremely popular I Got the S**t Kicked Out of Me to get the video played. The plan backfires. The equisapiens are hailed as a ground-breaking scientific advancement, and WorryFree's stock reaches an all-time high. Cash apologises to Squeeze, Sal, and Detroit, and joins the union in a final stand against RegalView. Breaking into Lift's home, using a security code from the equisapien's video, Cash is arrested and knocked out by police in a riot. The equisapiens overpower the police and free Cash. Detroit and Cash reconcile and move back into the garage of Sergio's home. Cash eventually transforms a equisapien, and leads a mob to Lift's house. Cash breaks down the door and lets out a frightening roar. Also starring Omari Hardwick as Mr. Blank, Kate Berlant as Diana DeBauchery, Michael X. Sommers as Johnny, Ratatouille's Patton Oswalt as Mr. Blank's White Voice, Lily James as Detroit's White British Voice, Forest Whitaker as First Equisapien / Demarius and Rosario Dawson as Voice in Elevator. Stanfield does give a good leading performance, with good support from Thompson, Crews and Hammer, and the well-known ""white voices"". The first half of the film is more what I expected, then it switches gear and turns into something completely different, and much stranger. To be completely honest, I found it very weird, there were small elements of it I liked, and the odd amusing moment, like Marmite you will either love it or hate it, in my opinion, an acquired taste and not great, but it's not a terrible dark comedy. Okay!",Sorry to Bother You
6,view_and_review,Crude Art,5,7 July 2018,"I would definitely classify this movie as artsy. By that I mean that the writer tried to convey a message in an indirect and flamboyant manner.The appropriately named Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield) is a struggling, unemployed young man who wants to do something big with his life. He gets the opportunity when he's hired on at a telemarketing company. As he makes one sale after another he is offered the dream gig of being a PC (power caller). As a power caller he can change his life for the better but at what moral cost?The first half of the movie was really good. It had a good flow to it, the humor was funny, and the plot was clear. The last half of the movie was different, almost like two different people wrote and directed the first and second half. The flow of it seemed to taper off, the humor waned, and the message became almost abstract. As it was I was trying to fully understand all of the visual and verbal non sequiturs but then I became a bit bewildered with the direction the film went. It sort of devolved into something crude and crass. I'm sure there was a point in that but I didn't see a need.This was Boots Riley's writing and directorial debut. There was some promise here but I think it missed the mark. I hope he gets another shot to do another project and--whereas I don't want him to dumb it down or make it commercial--I'd like to see a more palatable movie.",Sorry to Bother You
7,evanston_dad,Appreciated the Effort,6,4 December 2018,"I was just complaining to my wife about the lack of films this year that seem to be connected remotely to anything happening in the world right now, as if filmmakers are afraid to take on hot button issues. There's racism, immigration, gender equality, climate disaster, to name a few issues currently plaguing us, yet the movie that seems to have enraptured everyone is the wildly mediocre and irrelevant ""A Star Is Born,"" which has nothing to say about the times we're living in.How refreshing it was, then, to pop in ""Sorry to Bother You,"" and be assaulted by its highly original, if extremely messy, mish-mosh of ideas about racial and economic inequality, its barbs aimed at corporate America in particular and American capitalism in general, and one young black man's attempts to better himself without treading on those around him. I wish the film had been better; as it is, the screenplay is a hot mess, a sort of poor man's ""Get Out,"" that feels like a rough draft of initial ideas that never got pruned into a coherent story. But it's got energy to spare, and at least I recognize in this film the world we're all actually living in right now rather than the world it would appear many people want to believe exists instead.Grade: B",Sorry to Bother You
8,ferguson-6,Horse play with a message,7,12 July 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. All movie watchers know that the first rule of Fight Club is 'Don't talk about Fight Club'. And now we know that the first rule of Telemarketing is STTS: Stick to the script. The similarities between the two movies may be few, but hip-hop artist (The Coup) turned first time filmmaker Boots Riley comes out swinging in this offbeat, quite clever satire on race, corporate culture, economic factions, social division, and politics. It makes for a nice companion piece to last year's critical darling, GET OUT.LaKeith Stanfield (GET OUT, SHORT TERM 12) stars as Cassius ""Cash"" Green, a low key good dude living with his girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson) in his uncle's (Terry Crews) garage. Four months behind on rent, Cash wants to do something important with his life, he just doesn't know how ... and his current financial circumstances aren't helping. You may call him a dreamer, but he's not the only one (a Lennon reference seems fitting for this film). Cash's best buddy Salvador (Jermaine Fowler) gets him an interview at a dingy basement telemarketing firm - an interview that clues us in on the type of humor we are in for. Thanks to advice from one of the veteran telemarketers (Danny Glover), Cash utilizes his ""white voice"" and immediately has remarkable success ... and we get some pretty funny sales call visuals to correspond to the obvious capitalism statement. Ultimately his sales success gets him promoted to the ""power caller"" level and his own mentor, accessible only through the gold elevator. This leads to conflict with his friends, his girlfriend and his own moral standards. See, the basement dwellers are being led by Squeeze (Steven Yeun) in an effort to unionize for a living wage and tolerable work environment. As Cash continues to pursue ... well, uh ... cash ... his friends carry out their form of civil disobedience. This leads to police brutality, examples of corporate greed, and the downside to individual ambition.Armie Hammer plays Steve Lift, the egomaniacal corporate d-bag who takes Cash under his wing - for the purpose of making more money. The sales pitch turns to ""Worry Free"", a lifestyle being marketed through brain-washing advertisements for guaranteed food and shelter. One need only commit to a lifetime of corporate servitude. If that sounds like slavery, well, that's the point Riley is making. It's not so far off from the life many of us lead today, but of course this is presented in satirical fashion, so we are manipulated into laughing at ourselves and our society. There is even a popular reality TV show titled ""I Got the S**T Kicked Out of Me"", and folks can't get enough! The story kind of flies off the rails in the second half with some wacko-science fiction genetic engineering. The equisapiens have to be seen, as no written description will do. Even this segment has purpose. It speaks to how individuals and corporations can seize power and head in a questionable direction - all in the name of progress, efficiency and stock price. Stanfield excels in one of his first lead roles, and Ms. Thompson is her usual shining star. Kate Berlant (as the humorously named Diana DeBauchery) has a couple of excellent scenes, and David Cross and Patton Oswalt are terrific as the (extremely) white voices of Cash and Mr. _________ (played by Omari Hardwick). Filmmaker Riley offers up not a call to arms, but rather a call to wake up! Many of the decisions here mirror real life. Personal success can cost us friends, and political and professional choices may challenge our inherent morals (here, bordering on Faustian). The film is both provocative and funny, though a bit messy at times. You'll laugh while you think, or laugh after you think, or think after you laugh ... somehow you'll do both. OFFICE SPACE and Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL may be the closest comparisons; just be cautious if Boots Riley ever invites you to join in some horse play.",Sorry to Bother You
9,Hellmant,One of the most original (and bizarre) movies I've seen in years!,10,20 July 2018,"'SORRY TO BOTHER YOU': Five Stars (Out of Five)A sci-fi comedy about an African American telemarketer who begins using a white person voice in order to get ahead in his job. It was written and directed by debut feature filmmaker Boots Riley. The film stars Lakeith Stanfield, Tessa Thompson, Jermaine Fowler, Steven Yeun, Armie Hammer, Omari Hardwick, Terry Crews, Danny Glover and the voices of David Cross, Patton Oswalt and Lily James. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I absolutely loved it. The film is set in an alternate version of present day Oakland, where Cassius Green (Stanfield) has had a really hard time finding a good paying job and making a living. He's living in his uncle's garage, with his girlfriend Detroit (Thompson), when Cassius first gets a job as a telemarketer. He at first has a lot of trouble making sales while doing this job, until he learns the secret to success is using a 'white voice' (Cross). Cassius's problems quickly disappear as he gains more and more success doing this, but so do his morals as well.The movie is refreshingly original, I'd even say it's one of the most original (and bizarre) movies I've seen in years. It's also very funny, witty and extremely insightful; with spot-on social commentary throughout. Stanfield is great in the lead, and I think Boots Riley really makes a name for himself here. I can't wait to see what he does next.",Sorry to Bother You
10,cherold,Remarkable - and remarkably weird,9,9 November 2018,"Stylishly directed by first-time filmmaker Boots Riley, Sorry to Bother You is deep and crazy, wacky and satiric, silly and dark.The beginning is straightforward. A black guy becomes a telemarketer and discovers that his sales are better if he sounds white. Not the white voice white folk think they have, but the real white voice, nasal and bland (and voiced by David Cross).Boots establishes his intent to startle with the first calls, in which the protagonist, Cassius, physically drops into people's homes to sell to them. It's an audacious idea that softens the audience up for the weirdness to come.This weirdness, which you should avoid learning about before seeing the movie, ramps up steadily, from satire through theater of the absurd. By the end the movie is totally nuts, yet you follow it every step of the day.This movie isn't just silly and weird; Boots has a message. Or messages. The movie is about race, it's about complicity in one's own oppression, it's about the evils of capitalism, it's about ... well, I'm sure there's a list of all the things it's about.If you don't like weird movies, you're going to hate this. If you don't like political movies, or message movies, you might still like this, because the movie doesn't beat you over the head; it presents the message, leaving it to the viewer to pursue the meaning in their own head.The one thing I'm iffy on is the ending. It just felt abrupt, as though the movie had somewhere to get to and didn't want to waste anymore time. It's a minor quibble - it's not a *bad* ending - but I wish it had been handled a little better.Still, check this out. It's the first film from a unique cinematic voice.",Sorry to Bother You
11,FeastMode,my notes,2,26 July 2019,"Awful. so weird, and not in the good way. a social commentary filled with symbolism, aka movies i hate. there were some pretty funny parts which is the only reason i didn't give it a half star, but i hated this movie and could barely get through it (1 viewing)",Sorry to Bother You
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Sorry, not sorry.",6,13 December 2018,"'Sorry To Bother You (2018)' is a bit of an odd one. It's an undeniably original mash-up of multiple genres, motifs and, even, plot-lines that ultimately feels too unfocused to really have an impact. While it's unconventionality could have been a great strength, it unfortunately bounces around from idea to idea all too often for any of them to really stick, and it actually feels like nobody making it really knew what the film was 'about' (in the keenest sense of the word). This happens to the point that its most marketed aspect is perhaps its strangest, or most jarring, element thanks to how glossed over and seemingly inconsequential it is in the grand scheme of things - despite the fact that this element, pretty much objectively (at least, on paper), isn't the weirdest thing in the feature. Still, there's an underlying, if inconsistent, satire and a constant confidence of uniquely presented craft, both of which lead to some humourous, if not 'laugh-out-loud', moments and an overall sense of enjoyment. Plus, at least it's unpredictable (for better and, strangely, for worse). It works more in the moment than it does in retrospection and it's certainly not a bad flick by any stretch, but it doesnt quite gel and isn't actually all that impactful because of it. 6/10",Sorry to Bother You
13,gbill-74877,"Entertaining, and strong social commentary",8,22 July 2018,"'Sorry to Bother You' is funny in places and has an entertaining story, but what really makes it a good film is its strong social commentary. A young African-American man (Lakeith Stanfield) finds that to make it as a telemarketer, he must use a 'white voice', and then as he finds success and ascends in the ranks, that he has ethical challenges. Can he ignore those still at the bottom as they try to unionize to get a living wage? Can he ignore what his company is doing to other people all over the world with its actions? And can he remain connected to his culture and true self, without sublimating it entirely?The film gives you the perspective of an African-American person trying to succeed in a capitalist system where the dominant culture is white, and makes you think. Fundamentally there seems to be a choice between struggling to make ends meet at the bottom, or to compromise oneself by working one's way to the top. Of course director (and writer) Boots Riley is giving us the extremes here, but that's what good satire does, and there is plenty of truth in this movie. There is a universal message here as well - at what point does a company do something that crosses a line, and no amount of money justifies you contributing to that? He also gets in a few jabs at the state of entertainment in America, where people revel in the misery of others.The performances are all strong, led by Stanfield, but Tessa Thompson as his artist girlfriend, and Steven Yeun as his co-worker pushing the group to strike, also stand out. Riley keeps the tone light despite all of the depth the film has, and doesn't dwell on the pathos. A great example is when the young telemarketer has 'made it', so that now he's on the executive floor and invited to a fancy party, but even then he's still forced to rap by the CEO and a large crowd. How this scene plays out is funny, but also disturbing, and as you reflect on it, it's just a powerful, powerful scene. Another example are the 'white voices' being dubbed in with Caucasian actors, which is funny especially the first time you hear it. At first I thought that I would have preferred it if they were done by the African-American actors, but then I thought this was also telling me something, that this is how foreign this mask is to the minority culture. I loved reading this story three years ago when it was included in an issue of McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, and was very happy the movie did it justice. It's certainly in keeping with the political messages of Riley's group 'The Coup' as well (check out the 2012 album 'Sorry to Bother You'). It was nice to see that the film was shot in Oakland, and little things like the cameo from W. Kamau Bell. Definitely worth seeing.",Sorry to Bother You
14,Cineanalyst,Political Absurdism,4,29 November 2018,"I have a low tolerance for political art. Regardless of the value of the message or whether I agree with it, art forms such as fictional narrative movies seem a poor medium for articulate arguments, but an effective means for blunt propaganda. That's what ""Sorry to Bother You"" is, too, in the tradition of George Orwell's ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" with a simplistic polemic illustrated by the absurdity of its dystopian scenario. Here, capitalism becomes slavery and literally dehumanizing, while labor unions and strikes are promoted, and there's a half-hearted commentary on race, as well. ""Sorry to Bother You"" is even self-reflexive in its lecturing, featuring some installations and performance art from within the story that makes the same points as the movie does. That the artist within the movie is rather stereotypically a Manic Pixie Dream Girl there to inspire the male hero and to potentially serve as his reward for doing right also rather neatly reflects the movie itself. Both are fantasies.I'd rate this higher, though, if the art were actually good despite the propaganda. Unfortunately, much of the dystopian vision is uninspired. The running gag of violent TV and a viral video, in particular, are unoriginal. The telemarketing bits where the seller enters the spaces of those he calls and the ""white voices"" of the black telemarketers fall flat, as does much of the rest of the comedy. I think the low point was when the strike leader went off on an irrelevant rant about STDs, which I assume was supposed to be amusing, but just seemed ill timed, out of place and out of character. It's bizarre, but doesn't reach Orwellian or Gilliam (""Brazil"" (1985)) heights.",Sorry to Bother You

16,westsideschl,Comedic Fantasy,4,31 October 2018,"From a minority ethnic perspective we get a fantastical look at working in lowly robotic jobs for the white man (not sure of their job examples, but the writers focused on telemarketers & sign twirlers). White business was represented and incorporated in this script as the ""WorryFree"" corporation which has decided to take corporate profit taking to the next level, i.e. ""humans have limitations so through corporate science we will genetically modify humans to be stronger, more obedient, more durable, and more profitable."" Thus, Equisapiens, half horse - half human to transform the workplace, and make more money. Dominate throughout was the using of white actors' voices dubbed into black actors to point out that there is even racism in how one speaks (I wonder if that's true with Asian or Indian English speaker).

18,eddie_baggins,One of 2018's most memorable and unique offerings,8,11 December 2018,"If you're looking to track down one of (if not the most original) cinematic offerings of 2018, then there's no need to look any further than debut director Boot's Riley's Sorry to Bother You.A film that defies any specific type of pigeonholing, Bother is a mix of social commentary, biting satire, black comedy and oddball science fiction yarn set in an alternate version of the city of Oakland that follows Lakeith Stanfield's meandering Cassius Green finding himself a new job and a new skill as a telemarketer but that's only part of the story that ends up unfolding in Riley's gonzo experience.Saying too much more about Bother's arc and little surprises would ruin much of the fun to be found in the film but suffice to say there will be places you didn't expect to be visiting as we follow Green's plight from lifeless office worker to top of the food chain ""power caller"" that sees him interact with a range of colourful characters such as Armie Hammer's arrogant CEO Steve Lift, Danny Glover's wise old office hand Langston, Steven Yeun's fiery protest organiser Squeeze, Terry Crews long suffering house owner Sergio and Tessa Thompson's artistic soul Detroit.Along this eccentric ride that's filled with colour, sass and more than a few smarts, Riley examines a number of current hot topic issues in imaginative ways and while the film begins to lose steam deep into its second half, this is one of the more promising and inventive debuts in some time and it's safe to say that Riley's transition from musical artist to filmmaker is one to keep a very close eye on if he can conjure up this type of originality again.Bother also acts as a fine showcase for its lead cast members with Stanfield the best his been yet on the big screen after bit parts in the likes of Short Term 12, Get Out and Selma.At first awkward and mopey, Green's transformation into a self-confident soul that morphs once more into concerned citizen is a bizarre one that Stanfield plays pitch-perfectly, ably supported by Thompson as long-suffering girlfriend Detroit, with the young actress once more delivering a turn that strengthens her case to be considered the best young actress working today.Final Say -Needing to be seen to be believed, Sorry to Bother You is an outrageously original offering that works across all its many genres. At times hilariously funny and at other times socially confronting, this is one of the year's most memorable offerings.4 soft-drink projectiles out of 5",Sorry to Bother You
19,TheMovieDiorama,"Sorry To Bother You called me with its ""white voice"" and analysed capitalism.",7,10 December 2018,"Weird. Just plain weird. Absurdist fiction has never been so thematically involving and unconventional, until now. There's so much to unravel, so much to absorb, that one review just wouldn't suffice. Riley's directorial debut is bonkers, but one that should not be dismissed. It amplifies current themes through dark comedy, and for the most part works efficiently. However, the world of telemarketing that is portrayed is one that I felt disconnected towards. A young African-American telemarketer adopts a ""white voice"" allowing him to thrive in his job. As his career thrives, he soon gets swept up in a conspiracy. Riley's screenplay is admirable. Intelligently breaking racial stereotypes by conforming to them, allowing the dark humour and thematic narrative to be conveyed. Whether it be the fact that the general public would rather listen to white callers, or showing that not every black person can randomly rap. Its originality and unique style, whilst not accessible for everyone, allows the scathing humour to be at the forefront. However, it's the broader look on capitalism and slavery that succinctly appeals to current masses. Portraying puppeteers as well as their puppets. Fortunately, the stellar cast of Stanfield, Thompson and Hammer, made the absurd seem utterly realistic. Grounded performances with subtle comedic touches. Riley's visual style, particularly when cold calling customers, was refreshing and proves that innovative originality is still available. Still though, I have my doubts on the film in its entirety. After a specific plot point where Hammer's CEO character is ""horsing"" around, the story suddenly becomes disjointed. Perhaps it's the shocking revelation that follows, but I found myself struggling to get reconnected with the story. The characterisation and the pacing almost stops as the plot becomes weirder and more absurd. Also some of the humour fell flat for me. But the unique endeavour that Riley has lovingly crafted is one that should not be missed, for I am not sorry that Sorry To Bother You bothered me.",Sorry to Bother You
20,Ed-Shullivan,Catch a rising star,7,4 July 2018,"This film is a refreshing new entry that combines comedy, fantasy and even a bit of science-fiction so although this film may not appeal to everybody's taste in what is a good cinematic experience it will sustain conversation around the water cooler the next day at your place of work.The film certainly reflects well on the film's main star Lakeith Stanfield who plays telemarketer Cassius Green who rises quickly through the ranks in his call center. Does the film make sense? No, not for most film fans but the concept is refreshing and it will appeal to open minded theater goers looking for something different and with a few fresh faces on the silver screen rather than the same old, same old, comedy/rom/com films that the film studios push out quicker than the world's population growth.What I think everyone will see in this film is the untapped (to date) natural comedic talent of fresh face new actor Jermaine Fowler who got his first foot in the door with the comedy television series Superior Donuts. (You can read my full review dated February 02nd, 2017.). Watch this film and see if you don't agree that Jermaine Fowler's character ""Salvador"" should have been featured more in this his first big role in a feature film.I give the film a decent 7 out of 10 rating!Good luck Jermaine Fowler...a new rising star !!!!!",Sorry to Bother You
21,matthewssilverhammer,An Alarm-Clock Movie,8,27 July 2018,"With Sorry to Bother You, Director Boots Riley has emerged onto the cinematic landscape like an unexpected houseguest busting down the party doors. As you can expect from any freshman effort, it's ladled with style, some of which comes off as more immature and insecure than fully realized. Mostly though, this is an unpredictable and wonderfully insane burst of colorful creativity that I can guarantee will be unlike anything else you'll see all year.
Set in either an alternative universe or a near-future, Cassius Green finds himself in a whirlwind of macabre success and personal compromise when his ""white voice"" propels him to the heights of the telemarketing game. The cast is jam-packed with talent. Stanfield is immediately empathetic, Thompson exudes strength, while Cross and Oswalt embrace their voice-roles with hilariously exaggerated genius.
The sales scenes are uniquely kinetic, with Cassius shown literally dropping into the customers home, representing the all-too familiar privacy invasion of unsolicited calls. It's a daring choice in a movie full of daring choices. Most of those choices work, and even those that don't are easily forgiven for their unabashed, fence-swinging nobility and their Atlanta-esque humor-mix of parody and dryness.
Best of all, Sorry to Bother You uses all this to present a thinly-veiled vision of what being a person-of-color goes through in America. To survive, many minorities are forced to compromise their integrity, lose their cultural truth, and suffer a molecular altering of personal character; ""If you see a problem you can't fix then you decide to just get used to it."" This is a bright and bold alarm clock movie, that uses wild entertainment in hopes of waking us all up.",Sorry to Bother You

23,paul-allaer,Wild social satire is all over the map,6,14 July 2018,"""Sorry To Bother You"" (2018 release; 105 min.) brings the story of Cassius ""Cash"" Green. As the movie opens, he is caught lying on his resume during a job interview at RegalView Telemarketing. He can't believe his good luck when he's offered the job anyway. ""Just stick to the script"", his new boss tells him. Later we get to know Cash's fiancee Detroit. When Cash starts his job selling encyclopedias, it takes him a while to find his groove. An older coworker gives him some advice: ""Use the white voice""... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the movie writing-directing debut of Boots Riley, best known for his rapping band The Coup (whose 2012 album is also called ""Sorry to Bother You""). Here he goes the social satire route, by way of a wild (and wildly imaginative) tale set in Oakland in the near future. The farther we get into the movie, the crazier it becomes. Riley tackles many issues, including racial stereotyping and prejudice, cheap labor/unionization, police brutality, and so on. Yet the movie is at times hilariously funny too. In other words: this movie is all over the map. Sometimes it works, other times it steers off course, if not off the tracks altogether. LaKeith Stanfield, best known for his prior role as Snoop Dogg in ""Straight Outta Compton"", delivers another outstanding performance as Cash. Danny Glover has a small role as the older coworker. If I have one word of caution, it's that the movie's trailer, which I had seen, is not indicative of what the full movie really is all about. So keep an open mind, and roll along with the punches. ""Sorry To Bother You"" premiered at this year's Sundance festival to immediate buzz and acclaim. The movie finally expanded wider this weekend, and opened on about 6-7 screens for all of Greater Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well at all, much to my surprise. If you are in the mood for a wild and at times over the top social satire, I'd readily suggest you check out this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",Sorry to Bother You
24,subxerogravity,"It does try hard to be brilliant, but in that effort it is.",7,9 July 2018,"A lot more bizarre than the trailer makes it out to be, and good for a few laughsThis movie went to a place I would have never expected from watching the trailer. You can tell director, Boots Riley was about to go out of the box, but this cat was trying to destroy it. You're either going to love how strange the movie gets or hate it how really stupid it gets, but I think it's going to go down in history like Fight Club. It's going to be one of those cult classic that people talk about and go see at midnight movie events. Aside from that, I'm really digging this new cat Lakeith Stanfield. I think he's got a chance to be one of the best out there.So Sorry to Bother You, bottom line, not as funny as I thought it was going to be but I do like how surreal it gets.",Sorry to Bother You
25,Turfseer,First-time activist director shoots down straw man CEO in this juvenile satire on corporate malfeasance,3,22 December 2018,"Sorry to Bother You is the product of one Boots Riley, a music producer and rap artist who has ventured into film for the first time. Riley, according to Wikipedia, was born to parents who were both social activists and has carried on his parent's mantle by promoting left-wing causes throughout his career primarily based in Oakland, California.
Riley is not without talent, particularly in offering up a creative smorgasbord of visual styles (his background in creating and producing music videos in the past has helped him to that end). In addition, he manages to extract some decent comic performances from his performers here, including luminaries such as Danny Glover and Tessa Thompson, along with an up and coming star, Lakeith Stanfield.
Despite the impressive production design, Riley's screenwriting leaves much to be desired. Echoing his left-wing bent, Riley's story revolves around his protagonist, Cassius ""Cash"" Green (Stanfield) who moves up the corporate ladder at a telemarketing firm, RegalView.
Cash finds success after receiving advice from an old-timer at the firm, Langston (Glover), who counsels him to adopt a ""white"" voice when making sales pitches over the phone. Riley mitigates this chauvinistic conceit that there is such a thing as a ""white"" voice by poking fun at black culture too (Cash for example is introduced as a loser who lives in his uncle's garage).
In a series of montages, Cash impresses his superiors by suddenly becoming a successful telemarketer utilizing this new found ""white"" voice (Stanfield has his voice overdubbed by a white actor). Langston instructs Cash to sound happy and optimistic (Riley maintains that certain whites sound this way due to their economic success-but achieved at the expense of the economically disadvantaged).
You might believe that Cash's success is dependent on techniques of persuasion utilized with this ""white voice""-unfortunately no, as it's merely by dint of this particular voice itself that earns Cash his promotion to ""Power Caller.""
The implication of course is that if you're white, you automatically have an advantage in advancing to higher level in the corporate stratosphere. Riley's satire is weak as not ALL whites in the real world will advance-only those with some kind talent as they apply themselves in the telemarketing world. Here Cash shows no extraordinary sales knowledge or persuasive techniques to land him his promotion; had Riley dreamed up a few, Cash's upward mobility would have been more believable and his character more sympathetic.
Riley's satire gets even worse in the second half. This is where Cash gets his promotion as ""Power Caller"" and eventually is introduced to Steve Lift, the CEO of the hugely influential WorryFree-a company undoubtedly modeled on Amazon. It's WorryFree that guarantees free food and lodging for its employees at the expense of a lifetime contract. The workers work under conditions of virtual indentured servitude.
Riley violates a prime directive of good satire: respect your adversary. Instead he makes Lift into a creepy, cartoonish megalomaniac, responsible for turning his employees into ""equisapiens,"" shackled half-horse, half-human hybrids.
Instead of ridiculing these new generation of CEOs through good-natured humor, Riley resorts to suggesting they're much more malevolent than they really are. The activist-director is so convinced that his side is right that he loses sight of any kind of a balanced vision. Here the unions are sacrosanct and can do no wrong-while anyone involved in the corporate world is responsible for all kinds of sinister machinations.
There is also a sub-plot here involving Cash's girlfriend, Detroit (Thompson), a ditsy performance artist who belongs to the radical group, ""The Left Eye,"" designed to oppose WorryFree's influence. Detroit has little to do except support Cash as he must atone for his initial sin of becoming a ""Power Caller,"" betraying Squeeze (Steven Yuen), now head of the recently formed telemarketers' union.
Riley's sense of humor completely goes down the drain by film's end. Cash's initial plan to sink WorryFree by releasing a video exposing the workers' transformation into equisapiens backfires. Instead WorryFree's stock jumps through the roof after the experiments on the workers are hailed as a scientific breakthrough.
Once Cash finds he's been transformed into an Equisapien himself after ingesting a white powder given to him by Steve Lift, he breaks into Lift's home with other Equisapiens, with the suggestion that WorryFree's CEO will now be paying a big price for his prior perfidious acts. Now with a double meaning for the film's title, it's Cash who menacingly tells Lift right before attacking him, ""Sorry to bother you.""
Riley's satire is completely lost as his protagonist now takes revenge on straw man Steve Lift. It's one thing to point out tales of corporate malfeasance-it's another to do so in a juvenile manner which only suggests that the film's director is obsessed with ensuring that he's always on the winning side.",Sorry to Bother You

27,jadavix,Tiresomely off-the-wall,6,19 December 2018,"""Sorry to Bother You"" is a weird, weird movie, and I know: there's nothing wrong with weird. I just didn't feel like I was on board for all, or most, of what it was trying to do, and the parts I got were kind of lame.Take for example the protagonist, Cassius, discovering the secret to success at his new telemarketing job: use a ""white voice"". When he starts doing that, he climbs the ladder of his corporation with the ease of a dumb waiter.Oh, I get it: white people have a much easier time getting promoted at work. But if it's that much easier for them, why are there millions upon millions of white people stuck in dead end jobs? I don't doubt that black people might have to ""suppress their blackness"" to have an easier time on the job, but why would it be that much easier?Later, Cassius discovers a company which has basically legalized slavery, and even has a new race working for them, who have larger nostrils and larger penises than regular people. Like the above example, you would have to be a complete fool to miss the point here... but the point is so over-the-top that it misses itself. With this plot point, the movie makes a final detour into true surrealism, becoming so bizarre as to defy description. It was off the wall before, but not this much. The movie needed a frame that was bizarre enough to accomodate such a contrivance. I'm thinking of classic satires like ""Robocop"" and ""Starship Troopers"", which distanced themselves from reality enough to get away with stuff like that, but not so much that we missed the point.""Sorry to Bother You"" is the work of a Communist, so it should come as no surprise that it is so incoherent. To be aware of the death toll this most lethal of all philosophies has wrought in the last century, and to want to nevertheless label yourself such, is perhaps evidence of psychosis.",Sorry to Bother You
28,kevin_robbins,Overall this movie falling apart the way it did makes it impossible for me to recommend,6,14 June 2021,"Sorry to Bother You (2018) is a movie my fiancée and I saw in theatres as soon as it came out.

This is a weird movie. Now, I like weird but it has a lot of symbolism-which I'm not too fond of-and it is not like it is being advertised. From the trailers, it looks like a comedy about a telemarketer that finds a way to make money, and that is part of it, but then it goes into some really weird ......stuff. Lakeith plays the telemarketer trying to make a living-unsuccessfully-that gets tips from his co-worker, Danny, on how to use his 'white voice' to get more sales. FYI: David Cross does Lakeith's white voice, Patton Oswalt does another character's voice and Rosario Dawson does the voice of the elevator. Tessa plays Lakeith's girlfriend, who is an anti-establishment radical type. The other telemarketers decide to go on strike, just as Lakeith gets promoted and moves upstairs. That is where Lakeith meets Armie, the boss that is against unions-Duh!-and heads a separate company called 'Worry Free Living' that provides food, security and health care for anyone that will work for free. Then, there is the horse/human hybrids that are used as slave labor. Remember, I said weird. Forest Whitaker does one of the voices of the hybrids. This movie is not for everyone. It's directed by first timer Boots Riley, who is in a rap/hip hop group called 'The Coup'. It is different and if you like social satire and symbolism, you may enjoy it more than I did.
It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes.

35,I_Ailurophile,Brutal and uncompromising,10,3 May 2021,"Writer-director Boots Riley is a person with no qualms about speaking their mind. 'Sorry to bother you' is a stark commentary on capitalism, and the structure of our society under its fist, filtered through the art of storytelling. It's funny, and unsettling. It's surrealist, to an extent, but only insofar as Corporate America hasn't pursued (all) the notions conveyed here - yet. And it's absolutely brilliant.Advance trailers indicated a laser focus on racism as well, and that's certainly true, as black telemarketer Cassius (LaKeith Stanfield) finds success only after he discovers his white voice (David Cross). This pointed reflection of the unconscious racism we all participate in is echoed as his girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson) is alternately voiced by lily-white Lily James, and Cassius' enignmatic, unnamed, but forceful handler (Omari Hardick) speaks almost exclusively with alabaster icon Patton Oswalt's timbre. While the lens on racism and our latent prejudices take a back seat in the narrative after a time, it absolutely pops up again, in a particularly cringe-worthy scene after Cassius gains entry to the higher echelons of the firm. And that's when the movie really starts to take a turn.'Sorry to bother you' is about many things: the way we compromise ourselves to get ahead, or even just to get by, in our nightmarish capitalist hellscape; the ties between the things we don't need being sold to us, and the death, destruction, and oppression being sold abroad or even just behind the scenes here at home; the importance of taking a stand; a clarion call for labor unions, specifically, and for collective action generally... and so much more. The WorryFree corporation could symbolize any sufficiently regressive capitalist organization, but it's a naked representation of Amazon specifically: the Everything Store, becoming too the Everything Manufacturer, who aims to ultimately be simply Everything. It's a small step from Amazon's treatment of its workers to the demands that WorryFree makes of theirs. And while WorryFree's looming ambitions are the stuff of fantasy, the future of genetic engineering in the real world has plenty of its own worrying implications that should deeply alarm even the least studious amateur ethicist.And still we're not done, as 'Sorry to bother you' also spotlights how the damage done to global society by capitalism means that even a transparently amoral toad like Steve Lift (Armie Hammer, at his sleaziest), a symbol of all that is wrong, is himself only a servant to The Almighty Dollar. The power wielded in nebulous financial markets means that even a damning violation of human rights will be not just ignored but altogether applauded and rewarded if it will make more money. Police and private security are violent goons, mere puppets of the wealthy to squash the slightest interruption to the ever-hungering economic furnace. And ordinary people are generally too wrapped up in the most trivial or even boorish of entertainment and distraction - and struggling, too, under the oppression of their capitalist overlords - to do anything about it.Riley's screenplay should be required reading for all, and his film required viewing for the utmost excellence with which it is brought to life. Beyond even those I've already named, the staggering cast includes Terry Crews, Danny Glover, Robert Longstreet, Forest Whitaker, and Steven Yeun. They, along with all crew from lighting and set design to wardrobe and editing and beyond, have produced a momentous work of sociopolitical criticism.Of course, this is a movie, and the most true, empowering, radicalizing, and convincing argument in the world does not of itself make for a compelling motion picture. Thankfully, Riley is up to the task, and 'Sorry to bother you' wraps its lively discourse within a highly engrossing narrative. Characters are real and relatable - it's very easy to see ourselves, and our struggles, in those we see on screen; we also can all surely name individuals who bear a striking resemblance to the slimier folks in the feature. The plot is an endless rabbit hole, digging deep, with every turn providing a new window into the horrid madness of our society. It's thrilling, it's exciting, and we can't peel our eyes away from the picture even if we wanted to.This isn't the sort of movie that a lot of people would generally want to watch purely for fun. That's unfortunate, because it IS deeply entertaining, and the messages it has to impart about our world are 100% essential. Riley is highly outspoken about white supremacy, and the evils of capitalism, concepts that should be of the greatest priority for us all to educate ourselves on - and this is the very core of this fantastic film.For both its quality as a work of cinema and the commentary it has to convey, 'Sorry to bother you' is a movie that everyone needs to see, and gets my top recommendation.Bravo, Boots - bravo.",Sorry to Bother You

Boots Riley's feature film debut is overwhelmingly bold and unapologetic about what it wants to be, and that's not only refreshing to see in general, but extra admirable when it comes from a first time director. He's certainly a filmmaker to pay attention to in the future, after a debut that's this compelling and gloriously off the rails.On paper, Sorry To Bother You can be seen as covering familiar themes, regarding- broadly speaking- race, class, capitalism, and the decline of society. I get the sense it's often hard to make movies dealing with this sort of subject matter without it seeming too derivative, and I know personally I've lost count of how many times I've come away from a movie thinking that I liked the message, but didn't find the execution particularly exciting or entertaining. Sorry To Bother You works hard to subvert this, and for me personally, many of its bizarre ideas and out there concepts worked and paid off well. Even, to some extent, the particularly controversial third act twist that seems to have polarised many viewers, perhaps understandably. It surprised and confused me, for sure, but also gave me a really unpleasant feeling of horror that I rarely get out of movies, and certainly wasn't expecting out of this one.That aside, the film does have an absurd, heavily satirical tone, and if you can do your best to get on the film's wavelength I think there's a great deal to laugh at and think about. Because yes, thankfully the movie is genuinely funny. Despite dealing with serious themes, it never really feels as though is strays out of the realm of absurdist satire, maintaining a vibrant, fast pace throughout. In fact, I almost wish it were longer. It's not that the pace is too fast necessarily; maybe more-so that I loved the world the film constructed, and just wanted to see more of it. It's the world building and detail that made me compare it to Black Mirror in my review headline, although it is more thought out and contains a higher level of production value than your average Black Mirror episode, which tends to be more direct and intent on honing in on one particular social theme or issue at a time. Sorry To Bother You tackles many, and that coupled with its fast pace and immense attention to detail makes me think a second viewing would help me appreciate the movie even more.The cast all impress here, with star LaKeith Stanfield in particular standing out. I've seen him in a few supporting roles, so it was great to finally see him in a lead performance, and he carried the movie well (apparently Donald Glover was at one point being considered for the role, and I'm sure he would've been great here too). The soundtrack is as offbeat (and sometimes eerie) as the film's overall tone and style, and complements the slightly sci-fi and boldly colourful aesthetic of the film well. The movie as a whole might not always work for every audience member, and there were a few points where I was admittedly confused and slightly overwhelmed, but I can say that Sorry To Bother You is never boring. Even if it's frustrating, I can't see many viewers not wanting to finish it once they start.I guess it was too weird to get a lot of attention and awards consideration upon release, but the odds are in its favour for Sorry To Bother You becoming some kind of cult movie going forward. It's smart, funny, and unafraid to take risks, arguably even to the movie's occasional detriment. Still, if you're in the mood for something offbeat, or want to see another movie that deals with class and capitalism after watching the recent Best Picture winner Parasite, I'd easily recommend Sorry To Bother You. It may be a hard movie to top, but nevertheless, I can't wait to see how Riley chooses to follow it up.",Sorry to Bother You
44,proud_luddite,Odd and fascinating,7,10 October 2018,"In Oakland, California, Cassius ""Cash"" Green (Lakeith Stanfield) is a young African American with money troubles and ends up working at a telemarketing company. In a partly real / partly surreal atmosphere, the temptations of success (as he uses a ""white voice"") lead Cash into a very bizarre world.The first half of the film is relevant in its exposure of the exploitation of workers in a horrible line of work. A clever device is used to show the invasiveness of telemarketers as they interrupt their targeted callers. The movie later morphs into an odd but intriguing fantasy-satire that exposes the greed and manipulation of modern capitalism. There are unnecessary scenes of humiliation against two of the main characters. This is only part of a trend of the film that goes too far in the second half. But unlike numerous other films that go way off base, ""Sorry to Bother You"" does eventually get back on track with a very satisfying conclusion. It also succeeds in a universal, timeless theme: while money and success are desirable, at what point does the pursuit of it cost one's soul?",Sorry to Bother You
45,maurice_yacowar,Satire of gig economy drifting into fascism.,10,17 July 2018,"This richly inventive satire may have been 10 years in the making but it speaks trenchantly to our moment.
 The title is the telemarketer's opening gambit, but it also works as a pseudo-apology to the film viewer for interrupting his entertainment-time with a rude awakening to our harsh social reality. The profit-uber-alles ethos is propelling us into a fascist state. 
 The initial satire targets corporate salesmanship. Management create an illusion of ""family"" and ""team"" to harness their commission-only drones selling delusions of success through unnecessary products like encyclopedias. (There's an endangered species.) This is a sad view of our gig economy.
 But the telemarketer's prime customer has a larger humanity to numb. They offer Worry-Free Living, a sweeping assurance policy that will guarantee its clients a life of work, ""security,"" minimal comfort, in short, an updated version of slavery. Company head Steve Lift carries the promise of improvement in his name. 
 Even its glossy commercials reveal the system's total abandonment of privacy, of individual living. In exchange for guaranteed - i.e., unending - labour the clients enjoy living in rooms full of bunk beds, with drab uniforms and meals of slop provided. This is the no-worry life that can seduce individuals to resign their humanity.
 In offering to meet all its workers' earthly needs, that company seems to promise a kind of socialism. Instead it delivers a tyranny, a total reduction of its workers to a brutish life. Here the film parallels the conversion of the pretence to populism in America and Europe into right-wing fascism. 
 Company head Lift takes his dehumanizing one step further. He is using a drug to turn his serfs into equine-sapiens, humans with exploded muscle strength but with the heads of horses. This brutalizing makes human labourers all the more efficient. For a saving grace, they get the horse's schlong too. Every cloud....
 Our nebbish hero Cassius Green grabs the telemarketing gig as a last resort. His surprising flair gets him promoted to Power Caller, which llifts him to meeting the impressive Steve. Having succeeded as seller, Cassius is now converted to product. Lift offers him $100,000,000 to undergo the horse change and work as the company's agent in the workers' union for five years, after which a serum will - hopefully - return him to human normalcy. He gets to keep the schlong.
 Instead of accepting Cassius tries to expose Lift's nefarious scheme. But the company's spectacular profits valorize even that evil practice. Money talks; who knew? Only by submitting himself to painful abuse and humiliation on TV can Cassius air his scandalous revelation.
 The film's activism is encapsulated in Cassius's girlfreind, Detroit. She swings a sign-company's advert on a street corner, but her real calling is politically driven art. In addition to her paintings and sculpture, she does a performance piece in which she also maintains dignity in the face of the audience's (invited) abuse. That anticipates Cassius's strategy. 
 Detroit's very name evokes the America of economic and racial injustice. In his name Cassius combines the ""slave name"" of the revolutionary fighter Mohammad Ali with the society's hunger for the long green, which also reduces Cassius to Cash. 
 The central characters may be black but in the film's major concern race gives way to class. The traveling labour organizer Squeaze is Chinese. This struggle is not black vs white but Haves vs Haven'ts. 
 In their speech Cassius and Detroit have left behind their street-smart. They speak white like Will Smith. But Cassius's sales success lies in his affecting an even whiter tone, the voice of the Privileged/Confident/Carefree. That's economic not racial. That voice sells and makes him a huge success-only to doom him to fulfill his user's baser intentions. Cassius's success not only pulls him away from his striking colleagues but dooms him to his boss's designs. 
 This dystopian Oakland satires sends a clear message. Voters of the West unite. You have nothing to lose but tyranny.",Sorry to Bother You

And I actually agree with most of them (although I probably didn't catch them all).But its too long (1h 50 is insane), it has too many subplots (way too many things to say that makes the experience unfocussed and messy), it could use some editing (the second act, more than anything), the comedy is too absurd (I literally laughed once, and it was probably the dumbest joke/commentary of the film) and the resolution a bit confusing (although, if I got it right, its nuanced and really great).In the end, other than being bored a bit in the second act, I don't regret watching this movie, even if in the end, I think is bad, probably because Im not into surreal movies that much.",Sorry to Bother You
48,rockman182,Sorry to Bother You (2018),7,9 July 2018,"Let me start off by saying I love Donald Glover's show, Atlanta. Fantastic show, and one of the best characters on that show is played by Lakeith Stanfield. This film had a weirdly interesting premise (based on the trailer) and a musician directing his first film. I was always going to see it. This film is something else. Its a hell of a trip but a very good debut for Boots Riley who manages to make a very fun and unique film. This is going to be a vehicle for Lakeith and Boots.The film is about a man named Cassius Green who desperately needs a job and luckily lands one for a telemarketing agency called Regalview. He becomes extremely successful closing sales, after using a ""white"" voice to connect with the customers on the phone. He eventually moves up to the upper echelon of callers, called a power caller. He soon starts losing his morals and the relationship with his lover and friends until he realizes the truth about what his new job entails.As mentioned earlier, this film is a hell of a debut for Boots Riley. I don't know if he was trippin' or if some of this came to him in a dream, but its wild. The film is crazy at times. The film tackles crazy ideas while still remaining funny and entertaining the whole way true. Its a film that isn't afraid to be relevant in talking about capitalism, mistreatment of the working class, and a dystopian future brought upon by the rich.Lakeith works well as a leading man and Tessa Thompson is also on the rise as she's in a lot of big films recently and I'd love to see more of both. Cassius's character is easy to identify with because he's a man who works hard and soon lives the dream of getting the riches. His character answers the question of whether we could lose ourselves and our morals in success. Overall, really enjoyable though I think its not for everyone. I can see this reaching cult status down the line.7.5/10",Sorry to Bother You

Then it does a 180 on you. Then you think you get it. Then it pivots in an entirely new direction. Then things flip upside down. You give up on trying to ""get it"" then it changes again and gets absolutely insane. Then it makes sense after you finish watching it while walking out of the movie theater.I'll do my best to review this film without spoiling anything.Sorry To Bother You is an allegory on selling yourself out in a capitalist world. The film is original and experimental with deeper themes and subplots. It covers race, labor relations, and adaptation among many other things. There are things and techniques tossed in this film that you don't see again. I can only imagine the creative process behind this film as a manic scribble session. The end result is a deranged movie that's actually exciting.Shout-out to Boots Riley for directing this mad movie and Lakeith Stanfield as his role as Cash, the protagonist.4.5/5.

52,springfieldrental,A Sincere Effort That Comes Up Just Short,7,23 July 2018,"It's not hard to imagine that first-time director Boots Riley has been heavily influenced by Terry Gilliam's dystopian science fiction film ""Brazil."" Instead of a mind-numbing bureaucratic government job, writer Riley places his protagonist in a greedy corporate conglomeration bent on squeezing the last penny from its lowly workers. 
 Riley, whose background includes music and community activism, uses his life experiences to deliver a surreal yet impactful statement on humanities' sell-out of the soul for the almighty high-priced dollar. The writer/director's ambitions are sincere, but his debut is uneven in spots. 
 As numerous others have mentioned, the first half is springing with engaging humor and insights of telemarking, something Riley had experienced by working the phones early in his life. But towards the middle, the film takes a more philosophical turn, with results that are not quite up to par as the first 60 minutes. His message, unlike Gilliam's ""Brazil,"" is muddled in its eventual unfolding.
 I do appreciate his and his crew's work in giving us a unique movie on the screen, a departure from the cookie-cutter products coming off today's Hollywood assembly line. Despite his late age at 47, Riley hopefully will tightened up his future scripts because he surely has the talent to excel in this business.",Sorry to Bother You
53,kjproulx,Bizarrely Superb,9,14 August 2018,"There are many ways of calling a film bizarre. When it comes to independent ventures, it really can go back and forth from being accessible to a mainstream audience. With the release of this year's Sorry to Bother You, the film has a premise that may attract fans of comedy/drama, but, when this movie truly kicks into gear, it's really a toss-up whether or not it will sit right with you. For fans of the medium of film no matter how strange, Sorry to Bother You may just end up being one of the best movies of 2018 to date, as it is to myself. For all its quirks and strange twists and turns, here's why I can't recommend Sorry to Bother You enough if you're ready to explore a film that explores the weird side of cinema.Following Cassius Green (sort of set in an alternate reality to our own), he receives a job at a telemarketing company, where he discovers a new voice and is able to make a huge profit for himself. Propelling himself into greed and forcing his life to spiral into a metaphor that reflects the social issues of our daily lives, Sorry to Bother You represents the horrible side of our society while also managing to be an entertaining and eye-opening piece of filmmaking. The core premise is very easy to follow, but once the twist occurs, sending this film on a course that you'll either buy into or find too bizarre to comprehend, it's true message begins to reveal itself.This movie has one of the most surprising turns that I've been able to witness in quite some time. Not only is it visually shocking, but it also manages to be a slightly comedic aspect to the movie while also being a social commentary for the mature audiences, which is really just writer/director Boots Riley displaying his creative mind to the world. Being his directorial debut in the feature film category, I can't wait to see where his career goes next. I truly believe that he has the potential to create stories that will be loved by audiences on a yearly basis. Riley definitely has a knack for telling a great story, even in the subtlest of ways.Although I pretty much loved this film from start to finish, upon reflection I must say that the first act of this film goes suffer from pacing issues. I feel as though Sorry to Bother You is trying to set up a few elements at the beginning that may not land with some viewers, but that's only because it needs to be able to pay off in the final act, so it's acceptable. Still, I found myself enjoying the movie at first, but it took a while to really hook me. I feel that will happen with other viewers as well. That being said, when the film concludes, I do believe that viewers will look back on the movie as a whole and appreciate the first act more. For that reason, I can't say it's a true glaring error, but it is definitely worth mentioning.In the end, Sorry to Bother You mixes a few genres together to make one wacky ride of a film. There are visuals that will stun you, an over-arching story that will open your eyes to our ever-evolving society, and a quiet editing style that seamlessly takes you through the film with ease. This movie is absolutely not for everyone, especially due to the fact that the third act is very ""out there,"" but, if you're prone to liking movies solely based on a good execution, regardless of how strange it becomes, then I can't recommend this movie enough. Sorry to Bother You is one of my favourites of 2018.",Sorry to Bother You

The movie stars Lakeith Stanfield, Tessa Thompson, and Steven Yeun. The movie is about an alternate world where a young African-American telemarketer adopts a white accent to succeed at his job. Through this success, he discovers a conspiracy in society.Sorry to Bother You is a good comedy motion picture. The movie has a fun plot with hilarious dialogue. The story is also fun to follow with Lakeith Stanfield's performance as Cassius Green being magnetic. The story does get political at times, but it is still funny with its dialogue.The movie's direction is absolutely wild. This movie feels absolutely surreeal and can feel as if things are moving at a roller-coaster pace. It absolutely did feel that the movie did not feel real as it began feeling like a fantasy. I believe the creators of this movie were going for this feel to make the dark parts of the movie seem lighter. The movie's direction is still one of its strengths and the surreal direction aids in the movie's tone and mood.The plot is absolutely great for about the first two-thirds of the movie. The first two-thirds of the movie cover lots of modern day troubles and even the absurdities of modern life. It is a great satire to see as Cassius Green rises to the top of society through his special gift. The movie's last third is when the movie becomes more absurd and surreal. The movie introduces hybrid horse and humans that will replace the workforce at Worry-Free. This is all organized by Steve Lift, Worry-Free's CEO that created the hybrid equisapiens. This is when Cassius Green becomes an activist and seeks to stop Worry-Free. This jump was strange but not out of the bounds of the movie. It was here that the movie became less funny. Despite this shift, I still enjoyed the rest of the movie but it can get too weird for some.I would recommend Sorry to Bother You.Grade: B",Sorry to Bother You

Its unique and fresh approach to its social commentary may be off-putting to some, but it is certainly worth watching thanks in part to the film's brisk pace and tongue-in-cheek humour. Lakeith Stanfield is the perfect straight man in the surreal world this film has created and his reactions to everything around him brilliantly encapsulate the surprises the plot throws at not only him, but the audience as well.

The humor is the best part - there are several laugh out loud moments, and the humor intelligently uses the societal backdrop to great effect in its comedy. I was really enjoying it through the first two acts - Stanfeld is very good, and the symbolism of the society in the movie and themes of exploitation and unionization were really well done. As Stanfeld learned more about the society and continued to struggle between his moral values and individual success, the details of the world unfold and the viewer has a lot to contemplate. Unfortunately, the good build of the first two acts comes crashing down in the third act, which completely comes off the rails and cheapens the emotional and intellectual investment of the first two acts. Obviously the idea of horse people and the way it was presented was totally insane, but what really did it for me was Riley's failure to engage the audience in any way with Cassius' attempt to fight back against the company. All of these wild developments happen... and literally nothing changes? On top of being clearly unrealistic, the third act showed enormous inconsistencies in Cassius' character, WorryFree's structure, and the state of society as a whole. The final two scenes in which Cassius becomes a horse really sealed it for me as just completely ridiculous.

67,PyroSikTh,Everything in this Movie Means Something,7,1 September 2019,"This movie was not exactly what I expected, and I still can't decide whether that's a good thing or not. We follow Cassius Green (cash is green, get it?) as he goes up the ranks of his telemarketing job until he's meeting with the CEO of another company to become the figurehead of the labour force. He manages this by discovering his 'white voice', immediately making him a high-flying salesman. Meanwhile his friends are attempting to orchestrate a revolution against the company in order to get a pay raise, and his girlfriend flips signs while building up an art exhibit on the side.That is this film in a nutshell, at absolute surface level. In truth there's so much to Sorry to Bother You, that nearly twenty-four hours later I'm still processing it's many layers. Every frame, every line, every choice in making this film was deliberate and means something to one end or another. This film has a lot to say, and I'm not sure it ties all of it together tightly enough, but it's messages and themes are all executed really well on their own. The two biggest ones relate to capitalism and (somewhat obviously) racism. The very concept of using a 'white voice' has huge racial implications, implications that BlacKkKlansman maybe doubled down on more so than this movie did. But there's a lot more to the subject of race in this movie as well. All the protagonists are minorities; black or asian, and of course the antagonistic CEO is white. In fact it could be argued that white people in general are the antagonist of the film. This sounds fairly offensive, but it's this last point that ties into the other theme of capitalism. Capitalism is a typically white people thing, and the film makes slavery and poverty key points, things that are ingrained in the African-American community. The work Cassius finds himself in is basically as a slave trader, selling the poor and vulnerable to rich CEOs to be their work forces. He's confronted with the dilemma of what's more important, his morals, or his greed for wealth? A wealth that relies on his white voice to earn. And how far is he willing to go in pursuit of money? What is the absolute limit?And it's here where the movie takes its biggest diversion that will alienate audiences and turn many people off. Throughout the entire film's runtime, there's a vague sense of surreality. Telemarketing is mundane as a subject, and the satire is mined promptly. The film finds it's identity in weird little flourishes that make the film feel weird without making it a fully bizarre experience. The way the first act is filmed, it's choice of colours, the editing, the score, the way the story moves and transitions from one plot point to the next. On paper it's all normal, but there's something to it that feels a little off. This is done really cleverly to lull you into the film's alternate world, slowly allowing you to get used to it, to the point you don't notice it and take it for granted. It steadily gets weirder and weirder without you really noticing or being able to put your finger on it. And then around the end of the second act we get a twist that feels like it comes completely out of nowhere and suddenly thrusts you fully into the weird, but it's foreshadowed and hinted at subtly throughout the movie. Let's just say it takes the phrase 'work horse' literally. This is the lengths corporations in a capitalist society are willing to go.And there's so much more here as well, including the riots born of the telemarketing revolution (which were a little hard to watch what with recent events in Hong Kong), Detroit's art exhibit being a fine display of her hypocrisy, the black eye movement and Mr. ______'s eye patch, the overt racism of assuming every black person can rap and the awkwardness that follows, Steve Lift's limited understanding of Martin Luther King Jr. and how Cassius ultimately becomes the figurehead he refuses to be, the split of the run-of-the-mill telemarketers and the power callers who get to travel in a golden elevator, all the names are rife with symbolism (like Detroit being a fine example of a city where capitalism creates poverty), the media's manipulation and subjugation of the masses, protestors profiting off their own activism, black people and culture existing as entertainment for white people etc. etc. There's so much here to digest and it all links one way or another, but reconciling those links takes a lot of mental gymnastics.My biggest criticism of Sorry to Bother You isn't how surreal it can get, but just how it's trying to say too much, buried in subtext. Look too deep and it's overwhelming and messy, don't look deep enough and it's just plain weird. Ultimately this film earns kudos for trying something new, for not being afraid of embracing its own weirdness and proposing you accept it for what it is, or don't. One way or the other, I think Sorry to Bother You deserves to be seen, even if you don't like it. I give it a good but difficult 7/10.",Sorry to Bother You

73,gsygsy,It's good,7,2 December 2020,"A fine film from Boots Riley, artist and political activist. The man has an analysis of society and applies it imaginatively, so that his movie has a solid story to tell. If it strays into outlandish territory, it's chastening to recall how much in science-fiction has ended up as science fact.The prodigiously talented and highly watchable LaKeith Stanfield leads us through the movie as upwardly-mobile Cassius Green. He's well matched by Tessa Thompson as his artistically-politically committed partner Detroit. Jermaine Fowler and Steven Yeun are his excellent main men. Danny Glover contributes presence and star-power to a cameo role as an older workmate of Cassius'. Armie Hammer has a good time as the villain of the piece.There are many funny set-pieces, which are all well-integrated into the story. My favourite is an extended argument between Stanfield and Fowler, in which they attempt to pull verbal punches to hilarious effect.As the narrative heads further into the surreal in the film's last half-hour, the pacing slackens. I'm not sure why. Perhaps the underlying seriousness of the issues -- political exploitation of the poor and under-priveleged, money-making placed above human need -- compelled Riley to slow down, take his foot off the comedy control. If so, that's understandable. Whatever the reason, it turns into a different kind of movie before picking up the strands again for the final scenes.All in all, it's good.",Sorry to Bother You

75,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Likely the most innovative film of 2018 - vibrant satire!,9,15 July 2018,"No one could ever guess where Sorry To Bother You was about to take them upon a first viewing. It's that far out there, but with great purpose. This is a very original piece of satire that functions exactly how most great satire tends to: weaving back and forth rather seamlessly between cleverly executed dark humor and striking social commentary. Some of the more memorable sequences demonstrate both of these elements simultaneously in a rather provocative scene. There was one particular sequence (which may have been my favorite scene in the whole movie) where I found myself to be the only one cracking up in the entire theater - though I recognized the heaviness of it's statement, the absurdity of the execution was so surreal and so on point that I could not help myself - it just hit too hard, it was too good. There are many moments throughout this film where you will be unsure as to whether you should laugh or feel bothered, but that's exactly where it excels and holds it's place as a very unique and important film. Beyond that, the cast is great: particularly Lakeith Stanfield who effortlessly holds down the entire film with flying colors and Tessa Thompson who is endlessly charming and charismatic. As far as the filmmaking, the only thing the trailer reminded me of was Michel Gondry - the movie itself does carry a bit of that vibe, but it never feels like Gondry worship. It feels like a movie made by a Gondry fan who realizes his influence and wears that influence on his sleeve (especially considering there is a film within the film labeled as ""directed by Michel Garndry"" or something along those lines)... this is a unique creature!

Sex filled, hyperreal and a solid blend of humour, horror and just straight entertainment it's a good little experience. However at times things feel a slight bit messy and rushed as the style has no time for cohesion at points and the commentary other than maybe slight sprinklings of Marxism is a bit vague, supported by various interviews from Boots Riley himself stating there's no clear answer which is probably why Spike Lee's Blackkklansman (despite its criticism) and Get Out are infinitely more important as films on the mass scale touching upon the pulse of society whereas currently this feels like a swing and a miss. Despite its jarring jumps at points and the odd aspects of 'commentary' it's a perfectly fine piece of film as a stand-alone and one I highly recommend",Sorry to Bother You

Some social-realist (e.g. I Daniel Blake), some documentary (e.g. insert any Michael Moore films here), and some absurdist dramas (e.g. American Psycho). Sorry to Bother You had a bit of all of these, yet was totally unique. A satirical and often hilarious portrayal of modern day Capitalism through the medium of the call centre, which, according to my Master's dissertation at least, represents the 21st Century factory sweatshop. So I'm a bit biased. Cassius is a black 30 something with few prospects. He manages to find a job as a tele-marketer, only to find that his sales will be boosted if he uses his 'white voice'. Whilst this film had serious undertones, it is a comedy first and foremost, and I found it laugh out loud hilarious at times. However, I did have to stifle my laughter on occasions as I was clearly in the minority at some stages - such as when Cassius is asked to conform to his 'blackness' and do a rap song. I won't spoil it, but the result was very funny (for me anyway). I would give the film a higher score but there were a few occasions when I felt it was a little disjointed.

Nonetheless, this schmorgesborg of ideas remains a delightfully strange, intriguing watch. When it works, it works well, seeing David Cross' voice come out of LaKeith Stanfield's mouth is absurdly hilarious while making an important point on whitewashing. However, it flip flops between indictments of racism and capitalism without truly pinning down a target, and the third act may cross a line that's more WTF than it is clever.

It's a smart genre-blending mix of comedy and drama and, eventually, horror. And, at its heart, it's a subversive take on the black experience in America. Tick, tick, tick. Commission the think pieces!And yet ... while the comparisons work from a distance, they actually do Sorry To Bother You a disservice when viewed close-up.Get Out was a fantastic Trojan Horse of a film, at once unsettling and funny and then something else entirely. But Sorry To Bother You - though it also boasts a grand, final twist that boy do you not see coming - is in its own unique groove from the get-go: a heady mix of Charlie Kaufman smarts and Spike Lee social conscience, a visual mashup that's part Michel Gondry and part Stanley Kubrick.

87,Bertaut,A sharp satire that runs a little too long and takes a bizarre left-turn that will alienate many,7,24 December 2018,"A paean to the proletariat. A pro-union battle cry. An ideological evisceration of late capitalism. A deconstruction of corporate greed and the concomitant commercialisation of self-worth necessary to succeed. A critique of identity politics. An allegory of institutional racism in big business. A lampooning of Silicon Valley bro culture. Sorry to Bother You, the debut feature of writer/director Boots Riley, is all this, and more. Very much in the key of absurdist fiction such as Dino Buzzati's Il deserto dei Tartari (1940) and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (1952), as well as race-conscious satirical cinema such as Putney Swope (1969) and Watermelon Man (1970), the film draws more direct inspiration from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust (c.1806-1831), Repo Man (1984), and the work of Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and, bizarrely, Ken Loach.A black comedy/Juvenalian satire/science fiction/horror/magic realist/allegorical character study, it's impossible to classify. Dealing with the obstacles facing African Americans in a white-dominated corporate milieu, and positing that the experience of workers is determined by both labour conditions and race, the film examines labour relations, wage issues, worker solidarity, unionism, mass media, and the dangers of betraying oneself and choosing corporate advancement over friendships, relationships, and personal integrity. Although it's a beat or two too long, and although the spectacularly bizarre left-turn at the end of the second act will surely alienate a lot of viewers, the deconstruction and comic appropriation of code-switching results in a film that is constantly inventive, highly confrontational, and extremely funny.Set in Oakland, California in an ""alternate present"", the company WorryFree offers food and lodging in exchange for a lifetime labour contract with no wages, a practice which the Supreme Court has deemed legal and not equivalent to slavery. Standing against WorryFree is the radical group ""Left Eye"", who organise protests and vandalise WorryFree's billboards. Meanwhile, Cash Green (LaKeith Stanfield) is a telemarketer working for RegalView, who, upon the advice of a veteran co-worker (Danny Glover), discovers his ""white voice"" and rises to the top of the company's food chain. Gradually, however, he learns that RegalView is selling slave labour to WorryFree. Torn between exposing WorryFree and his substantial earnings, Cash's dilemma is exacerbated when WorryFree CEO, Steve Lift (a spectacular Armie Hammer) offers him a $1 million a year contract. However, Cash then makes a discovery that changes everything, not just for himself, but potentially for all of humanity.At its heart, Sorry to Bother is an anti-corporate, proletarian rally cry, something with which Riley has been engaged for decades as lead vocalist for The Coup and Sweet Sweeper Social Club. However, unlike the recent satire Assassination Nation (2018), Sorry to Bother You is not especially interested in politics per se, certainly not in the explicit sense of films such as Stachka (1925), Medium Cool (1969), or Bulworth (1998).This is not to say that the film ignores politics completely, rather it approaches the subject obliquely. For example, the country's most popular TV show, I Got the S--t Kicked Out of Me, involves people being violently assaulted by family and friends and then dunked in a vat of faeces, with Riley providing little to no contextualisation (think It's Not My Problem! from RoboCop (1987), where Bixby Snyder's (S.D. Nemeth) catchphrase, ""I'd buy that for a dollar"", is used as a one-size-fits-all response to every situation). This mindless consumption of meaningless and morally questionable content indicates the passivity of the masses, their critical faculties either dormant or absent entirely (an inverse verfremdungseffekt, if you will). Clips of the show feature prominently throughout the film, allowing Riley to depict a milieu where popular entertainment has reached an unimaginable low. Another example of a pseudo-political aspect of the film are the ubiquitous billboards and TV commercials advertising WorryFree, suggesting the corruption or co-opting of mass media.Riley's focus is very much on economic issues, with a lot of the humour derived from pecuniary-based situations. One of the easiest ways to parse the film is to approach it as a parable about selling out, equal parts polemic and acknowledgement that it's next to impossible not to sell out in some way. Indeed, the last act of the film explicitly deals with the literal dehumanisation of the workforce (and I do mean ""literal""). RegalView and WorryFree exist in an economic system built upon impoverishing the many for the benefit of the few, with Riley attempting to expose the importance of a poverty line for the continued functioning of late capitalism. Within such a system, he suggests, it is exceptionally difficult for African Americans to succeed unless they are willing to code-switch. In this sense, although the concept of ""white voice"" does have a practical function within the narrative, its most salient characteristic is as an object of allegorical satire, a hyperbolic caricature of what African Americans need to do to survive in the Caucasian bro-culture corporate ranks of Silicon Valley; they must literally relinquish part of the self and pretend to be something Other.Aesthetically, the film adopts a visual style obviously influenced by Michel Gondry, and, to a lesser extent, Terry Gilliam. An especially interesting aesthetic device, as anyone who has seen the trailer can attest, is how white voice is handled - rather than having the actors simply speak in a different voice, Riley instead has the white actors' voices overdubbed; when Cash's friend Salvador (Jermaine Fowler) first hears Cash's white voice, he literally tells him ""you sound overdubbed"". However, the lip syncing is, presumably intentionally, far from perfect, with the voice not quite aligning with the actors' mouth movements. This throws the scenes ""off"" ever so slightly, creating an extra layer of surreality, and highlighting just how absurd the whole thing is, drawing attention to the lengths these people have to go to achieve real success. The fact that our culture places such value on ""correct"" intonation is, in and of itself, absurd, like an extreme version of the phone voice that pretty much everyone has, and by failing to perfectly sync white voice to black actor, Riley is able to deconstruct and draw attention to this absurdity.The film's other big aesthetic innovation is having Cash plunge (not especially gracefully) into the living room of the people he calls, desk and all. Obviously, this draws attention to the level of intrusion with which most people greet telemarketers, but, at least in the early stages, it also highlights Cash's own discomfit at being the intruder, seen most clearly when he drops in on a couple having sex. This is an excellently-handled piece of visual shorthand, conveying Cash's internal process, without having him verbalise it at any point.Also impressive is the acting. While the standout performances are definitely Hammer and Omari Hardwick (playing Mr. _______, Cash's superior at WorryFree), Stanfield certainly holds his own, with his body-language providing a clinic of wordless performing. Early on in the film, he's hunched over and put-upon, his every movement seemingly uncomfortable, as if ill at ease in his own skin. Later on, however, after his promotion at RegalView, his physicality acquires a more easy nature, he carries himself more confidently, as if high-powered telemarketing has helped him to find himself, something which is, in the context of the whole, doubly ironic. And no matter how surreal things get (and trust me, they get very, very surreal), the cast keep everything grounded, as if what they're experiencing at any given moment is the most natural thing in the world.Of course, it isn't all perfect. The wildly unexpected plot twist at the end of the second act will be too much for some people (there were multiple walk-outs at the screening I attended). The film is also just a beat or two too long, and the bottom does fall out to an extent before it reaches its madcap dénouement. There's also a mid-credit scene that serves as a kind of epilogue that I'm led to believe was a re-shoot when test audiences found the initial ending too abrupt. For me, however, it doesn't entirely work, and I would have much preferred the original, somewhat darker, ending. Also, with so much satire and humour floating about, almost by definition, not every joke lands, However, the flip side to this is that when Riley's humour does hit the target, it's sublime - Mr. _______ literally beep-denied a name, for example, or Cash's two-word rap being gleefully cheered by Lift's assembled yuppies.Sorry to Bother You is as timely and relevant as it is funny and irreverent, as progressive as it is radical, and as inventive as it is confident. Exploring the intersection between race and economics from a wholly satirical point-of-view, the film both condemns and sympathises with those who choose to sell-out in some way so as to climb the ladder of success. Now in his late-40s, Riley is a veteran political protestor, a Chomsky-literate agitator, who is here positing that the most significant divide in the US isn't between white and black, it's between those with money and those without. Suggesting that the desire to cross this divide can lead to a herd mentality, the film argues that the labour force must never forget their collective strength, and must never turn on one another, as in such a situation, management will use workers like horses.",Sorry to Bother You

89,Jared_Andrews,The WTF Movie of the Year,8,18 July 2018,"Sorry to Bother You is a strange, surreal, hilarious satire guided by the intentionally unsteady hand of rapper-activist turned debut director, Boots Riley. It dabbles in commentary on media, society, race and working-class issues-so many poignant messages, some more successfully delivered than others. The fearless absurdism will likely distract some viewers from a couple of these messages, but I'm okay with that. I take this wonderful creation much more for its entertainment value than anything else. The messages that do resonate should come through clearly. Riley's story doesn't shroud itself in murky metaphors. It tells us exactly how to interpret the bizarre world he has created. Rising star LaKeith Stanfield plays Cassius 'Cash' Green, a deep-thinker who lives in his uncle's garage with his artistic girlfriend named Detroit (the invaluable Tessa Thompson). It comes as no surprise that a man who goes by Boots would opt to give his characters unusual names. These two are just the beginning. To collect enough scratch to keep up with his rent and put gas in the rusty bucket he drives, he takes a job as a telemarketer. When a wise elder advises him to use ""white voice"" to improve his sales, Cash starts to rake in the green. After he rises the ranks of the telemarketing world, ascending to the divine status of power caller, he attracts the attention of an eccentric, drug-fueled CEO, Steve Lift (Armie Hammer). His company, WorryFree (a place where employees feel anything but) hides a dark new idea. But when the secret leaks to the public, his stock unexpectedly skyrockets, and Lift is declared a pioneering genius. The rational-minded public undoubtedly opposed Lift's plan, but big business carried on. As union organizer Squeeze (Steve Yuen) explains to Cassius, ""if you show people a problem, but they don't know what to do about it, they just learn to get used to it."" If you think you have any of this plot figured out, think again. It makes a radical left turn in the third act that will tempt some viewers to jump ship. My advice: stay on board. Even if you don't want to totally buy in, just hang around to see where this new direction leads. The film flies along with such easy energy early, then hits turbulence when trying to figure out how to end this thing. Riley introduces so much psychedelic madness that by the end it's nearly impossible to wrap up the story. But at some point, one must come down from every trip. Even with as jarringly fantastical as it is, in many ways this movie also feels incredibly real. As Riley puts it, he strives to ""break down reality to help us better understand it."" Mission accomplished.",Sorry to Bother You

Weirdly enough, I remained invested. A radically off-beat critique of capitalism, this film had me laughing HARD, which is rare. Normally I'll smile or chuckle to acknowledge a film's comedy, but the extremely odd direction this story took left me genuinely disturbed and in absolute hysterics as a result.

And Armie Hammer is good in a dark performance as a corporate mastermind. Just when you think the film has run out of ways to be weird and is about to settle down, it will boomerang back at you with another quirky twist.Even though the conclusion is a bit sloppy, this is still a very enjoyable and refreshingly edgy film. It's a good idea to go in knowing as little as possible. Enthusiastically recommended.",Sorry to Bother You
94,OneAnjel,Reverse Racism at it's best,4,10 February 2019,"I'm giving it 4 stars as kudos to the sexy and talented Lakeith. I kept watching hoping it would go somewhere and I had to check to see if this was another Spike Lee concoction that was intentionally only on a black level. Props to all the actors here, really. But the film itself.... Let me put it this way: While all the people of the world of all races and creeds are fleeing from giant spiders, military, cowboys, aliens, Matrix's and bionic mushrooms (Ok that one hasn't been written yet), black folk are still putting greedy white folk as their boogie man. Sure, white man was the original monster in America, and we've all seen all the great films from A Raisin in the Sun, Roots, and The Color Purple, to Crooklyn, For Honor, D'Jango Unchained and countless others. Most made sense on some level to all races. But Sorry is not in their league. It is the epitome of the black whine, the endless anger that keeps the black community in mental and emotional poverty. Do they think their ancestors fought for their sanity and their freedom so that they could enslave their children with fear and build walls with the quintessential reverse racism? Are we really raising black kids to hate white people because of the past, cutting them off from huge opportunities by placing an angry 3-headed monster squarely on their forehead just to keep a vendetta alive? This film is clever, and did I mention LaKeith is the so worth the gander. But it is very racist and is part of what's wrong with the American culture today -- blacks silently spitting at whites and imagining that we all were born with a silver spoon and owe them far more than opportunity. But then if you became just another respected part of society, give up your martyrdom, turned in your EBT cards and stopped selling drugs to your own children, what would you do. What would you do. God forbid that you should open your eyes and realize that we are all slaves of something. Women are still slaves, not only in 3rd world countries but right here in the U.S.! Everyday people in other parts of the world DIE for their religious beliefs or to ensure their political freedom. Human Trafficking is a bigger industry than illegal drugs! So don't tell me about how you are still slaves because I see these girls here and now and they are not always black. Yet each year that passes I hear more and more black people suffering under this false notion that WE owe YOU something. Does my perpetrator owe me STILL for all the years I was abused as a gender? NO. I moved on. And I'm tired of suffering under your mistaken view of my mind, my interests, my ideas, my capability... This is the land of opportunity that people are risking their lives to come to and you are stuck in some fantasy where you end by rising up against the white power. Shame shame shame. Get a new monster.",Sorry to Bother You
95,bastille-852-731547,"Hysterical, Thoughtful Satire",10,29 June 2018,"I walked into this movie at an advance screening expecting something unique, but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer brilliance of this satirical masterwork. Hilarious from beginning to end while also subversive, this film joins some of the finest satires of its generation--from ""South Park"" to some of the best episodes of ""Saturday Night Live"" to ""Wild Tales.""The story follows Cassius, an African-American telemarketer in Oakland. When told to use his ""white voice"" on the job while making calls, he quickly rises through the ranks of his profession--and ends up getting a hefty promotion. All of a sudden, things start to spiral out of control. I definitely won't give anything else away, as doing so would spoil what clearly must be experienced for oneself. The film's script is incredibly strong and is consistently hilarious. I laughed more while watching this film than any other movie in recent memory. Its dialogue is not only humorous, but incredibly frank and on-the-nose in its brutal honesty. The film's social consciousness and commentary intersect in ways that are thoughtful, snappy, and deeply rooted in (often unfortunately) a sense of genuine realism. Yet the film's image of the world is not equal to our society with microscopic precision, as its humor often tends to look at current societal issues with the mirror of a macabre fun-house.Performances in the film are outstanding throughout, and the film is incredibly engaging throughout its run time. Free of pacing issues, it moves at a fast pace and twists and turns so unusually that one will never know what could happen next. This erratic nature is truly part of the film's genius. If such a style of narrative filmmaking was attempted to be used as a technique in almost any other film, it would fail miserably, but Boots Riley was able to commendably stay one step ahead of audiences while making them laugh profusely and question why and how our society may be in deep-seated decline. Also noteworthy is the film's soundtrack, which is a superb mix of rap and pop. The movie can often be strange, but viewers will be all the more thankful for its genuine audaciousness upon the film's conclusion.Riley's ambitious filmmaking has a variety of possible influences (Spike Lee, Jordan Peele, Alejandro Inarritu, Charles Kaufman) yet feels wholly original--and genuinely, howlingly funny and socially relevant despite being so unconventional--from beginning to end. Very highly recommended. 10/10",Sorry to Bother You

Likewise the dubbing of 'white voices' for 'black voices'; just awful. The theme is Faustian: sell your soul to the devil and reap the earthly rewards. And to the extent that the story follows through on the concept,. it's fine. But the production itself, the look and 'feel' of the film, the lack of spirit (more than once the film seems to die right before your eyes), the failure of the film is inescapable.Of course I don't know this, but perhaps the enthusiasm of the film's critics stems from their desire for something non-Hollywood; new, fresh, different.

Cassius lands a telemarketing job where his main clients are predominately privileged white people, the exact stereotype you're thinking of. When an aged co worker advises Cassius unless he is able to tap into his 'white voice' that he may never be successful doing what he does or even sell anything at all. So he hilariously taps into his own form of the 'white voice' and quickly becomes the most prolific caller on his floor garnishing him the coveted 'power caller' status gaining him a ticket upstairs, where the real commissions are. After several weeks or months Cassius now only sells what one could describe as morally distasteful but extremely gainful products but this seems to turn Cassius away from the only people who came from where he came from and rode for him everyday. Whilst all this is happening Cassius is thrown through monumental ups and downs as he tries to find some meaning in his work all the while trying to ignore any morals. With the infectious nature of his bosses work and words, Cassius is almost just another soldier in his plight to create an almost entire subservient and 'perfect' work force by any sinister means necessary. Once Cassius stumbles upon the most bizarre discovery, now set with two choices, become the subservient his boss desires with the draw of endless income or risk is all for the betterment of the entire planet Earth.What a wild ride this one is with an beautiful mixture of hilarious moments that keep you engaged and moments of pure suspense like 'what the hell is happening right now'.

133,flynnflon,Mixed Feelings,5,1 February 2021,"Still trying to process my feelings about this movie. On the one hand, it's been awhile since I've seen an independent movie, like this. In today's era of blockbusters dominating the majority of movies to get made, I was excited to check this out.Similarly, this really seems like an independent movie from the early 90's-and in a strange way, it dates the movie, in a negative way (for me).As someone who came of age during that era of independent film, I probably would have loved this, in my Gen X twenties. There are many familiar Gen X messages, that are peppered throughout the plot.Things like class equality, the evils of capitalism, selling out versus personal success, existential angst, racial stereotypes, etc. I know these issues aren't exclusively the domain of Gen-X, but again, as someone who fondly recalls that era, the presentation of them in this film, is very familiar.Not to mention the writer/director Boots Riley is a few years older, then me. As I say, this is familiar territory.But now, in my mid-forties, I noticed many aspects to this story, that felt forced, or trying to be clever in ways that seem a little too on the nose.I specifically think to the scene where Cassius is made to rap in front of a soulless crowd of minions, despite his insistence that he, in fact, cannot rap. The only reason he's asked to perform, is because he's black, so 'of course' he must know how to rap. After stumbling through some awkward verses, he switches to shouting a series of emphatic n-words, over and over again, and the crowd roars in approval.Obviously, this is a comment on the minstrel ish many people of colour, especially Black people, have to endure to be accepted/successful by a largely Caucasian power-structure, but the entire scene was full of eye rolls because it was performed in such a lazy manner.This movie finds itself entering into several of these predictable traps.The kind of trap a high-school play often falls into. Where it feels like you're speaking truth to power, on stage-but out in the audience, you're slow-clapping at the effort.Which begs the question, am I out of touch with those youthful ideals, or is this movie-with the benefit of age-just pretentious in its arc? Maybe it's both.5.5/10",Sorry to Bother You

Still,I honestly encourage you to give this movie a try and not skip it because of some mixed reviews,you should see it to at least have your own opinion of the movie and not to be influenced too much by others opinions.
After those being said,I have to say that Boots Riley made,in my opinion,one of the wierdest motion picture masterpieces ever,but it did it in such great way that ""Sorry to Bother You"" not only takes you by surprise with its content but you also laugh,enjoy and get a bit confused during the movie and after the movie ends.
Another great aspect about this film are the amazing soundrack combined with the breathtaking performance of all the actors,especially LaKeith Stanfield and Tessa Thompson,as well as the theme of the film.
I only gave ""Sorry to Bother You"" a 9/10 because of the somehow unexpected ending that I found a bit dumb if not a litte sad.The film could have ended with Cassius 'Cash' having a great day,in his house,with his girlfired Detroid but without his nose transforming into a horse nose.

140,cinemawithcj,Sorry to Bother You - Cinema with CJ Review,8,11 December 2018,"Sorry to Bother You is unlike anything I've really seen before. That's a statement that can be overused or undersold, but Sorry to Bother You is legitimately one of the most original and resonant voices in film I've seen in western cinema lately.Boots Riley's directorial debut off his own original screenplay, while this film deserves it in its own way, I'm sure it won't be recognised for any screenplay honours for just how out there Sorry to Bother You actually is.Inventive and off-kilter, Sorry to Bother You feels so much like if Charlie Kaufman made amovie except if it was full-on extroverted over introverted, and fuelled entirely by cocaine. It's a film that plays with structure and realism and art and quirky concepts and ideas that make for great visuals.It's effortlessly brought to life through its cast. Whether that's the leads like the brilliantly cast Lakeith Stanfield, or his ""white voice"" in David Cross, or even side characters like the fantastic Armie Hammer, who has one of the greatest character introductions ever.Sorry to Bother You is a feast of brilliant satire, though not aimed towards the current American administration (though you could definitely argue that it's unintentionally great as one). It speaks to how big business use the workhorses of industry for their greater good, how strings are pulled in the world to further exploit their way down the chain.Riley's film is effortlessly entertaining, intelligent, batshit crazy, wonderfully vibrant, drastically original, artistic, abstract, and just entirely pleasing across the board I.That's not to say the film is perfect, it's not. It plods around a little and feels longer than what it should be, but I can't lie and say I wasn't entertained the entire time. As the runtime ticks away it does progress further and further into the darkness and into the twister mirror pointed at the current world. It is fiercely anti-capitalist, it is full on with its motivations as a movie, it is a hell of a ride.Sorry to Bother You is a mission statement and it is a brilliant first step into Riley's cinematic career. I hope for more from this guy and I want him to go even further, if that's possible. This is a phenomenal first film for a director, and this is the sort of vision we need to see in cinema.Absurd, abstract, and astounding, I wish it were a tiny bit more refined, but still...",Sorry to Bother You
141,daveygandthekeyboard,Funny and messed up and political and odd.,9,17 July 2018,"Did not know what to expect walking in to this one, but I think the film had me at the part where protagonist Cassius Green tells the cashier at the gas station: ""40 on 2""...and then drops 40 cents in the tray to ""fill"" his busted out Toyota. Can't say I haven't been there. Maybe not all the way, but I've at least been part of the way.Cassius, or ""Cash"" Green (Lakeith Lee Stanfield) is having a hard time making ends meet, living in his uncle's (Terry Crews) garage while engaged to one Ms. Detroit (Tessa Thompson), who makes her own living as a sign twirler while creating her provocative visual and performance art. Cash ponders the point of it all while fantasizing about an easier life, perhaps even one involving giving up all freedom in exchange for security and a lifetime of crap work in a service called ""Worry Free.""Instead, Cash lands a low level telemarketing job at a company called Regal View, where he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams by heeding the advice of a colleague (played by Danny Glover) to use his ""white voice."" Cash gets reluctantly swept up in an uprising by his fellow employees who want to unionize at Regal View...while he gets promoted to ""Power Caller"" and gets to move upstairs, where it is ""white voice"" all the time.In his new role as Power Caller, Cash winds up being so good at this that it leads to another job. It then takes a dark turn as Cash's personal life and loyalty to friends takes a big hit, and goes even darker when he learns a terrible secret...Wow. I really liked this. I kinda wish I'd written it myself. It says so much about corporate greed, race relations, politics, the ""meaning of it all,"" the reality of just trying to get by, the intertwining of personal and business, loyalty to friends and loved ones versus survival, the nature of humanity and how excessive greed of giant corporations threaten our very humanity.

142,littlemankazoo,Off-the-wall!,9,15 July 2018,"If ""Get Out"" deserved to win an Academy Award for how original it was, ""Sorry To Bother You"" deserves to win about five times that amount.Where to begin with ""Sorry To Bother You""...This film is bonkers. Off-the-wall. Flamboyantly and unapologetically original. This film is ITSELF, and I cannot say I have seen many films like this.""Sorry To Bother You"" is the writing and directorial debut for musician Boots Riley, a previous contributor to the world of film as a songwriter for films such as ""Superbad"" or ""The Losers"".This film, however, has contents within that are no simple single. It has treasures worth an entire LP to dig through, and I cannot stress enough that it is a piece worth checking-out.The sense of style that Riley's direction features here is so off-the-wall and unlike anything I have seen this year, it really differentiates itself from the rest of the pack for this summer's field of films. Transitions from scene-to-scene are unique, the characters are entertaining and all identifiable to what they serve for this film's story.The ideas incorporated into this big, massive stew of a film that combines quite fantastic comedy writing with societal and racial commentary that really does cut deep at times is what makes it such a tremendous thing to stomach. I would dare call it 'overwhelming' for some viewers, if it were not so crazy and insane at some points that most 'normal' audience members would be driven-off already by then.Rather than what I found to be unfocused commentary that was featured in ""Get Out"", Riley's script manages to be an unholy, caffeinated lovechild of ""Office Space"" and ""Get Out"", worming its way into a position of being not only a hilarious comment on the workforce of today, but also how race and society factor-in as well.Along with this, the performances are all first-rate in every regard. Lakeith Stanfield is bought every second as our protagonist that is torn-between playing the system and being himself in a society that is adapt-or-die, his supporting cast keeps things upbeat, and the voice-over performances/cameo appearances by David Cross and Patton Oswalt make every moment they appear an incredibly fun time.That said, this film's penchant for insanity and turning the wick to 11 at every chance is where I feel some people may be lost. The story by the time it reaches its climax becomes somewhat muddled amidst all the insanity the third act decides to unleash upon the audience. This film's only true crime is that perhaps it is a bit ""much"" in some regards.However, for a film that very much fancies 'Style' over 'Substance', this one has all the style in the world. Funny, poignant, and overall a hell of a ride, ""Sorry To Bother You"" is one of the most unique and creative films I have seen so far this year.You can keep ""Get Out"".

143,travishouze,"""Sorry to Bother You"", But Your Going to Want To Stay on the Line for This",7,30 June 2018,"Sorry to Bother You is quite possibly the most insane movie I've seen this year. In a year of films Hereditary, and A Wrinkle in Time, none of the trailers really prepare for the insanity that ensues within the film. Wether it all comes together well or not is up for debate. I'm going to try my best not to spoil much because there's a lot to unpack.Lakeith Stanfield delivers as the charming Cassius Green, a young down on his luck guy who applies to a telemarketing job and is encouraged to use his ""white voice"" in order to succeed. During his eventual rise within the company, he begins to see the shady tactics his business entails, but becomes increasingly passive as he benefits, until he finds out the ugliest truths.One thing the film does great is visually describing the crazy world it takes place within. There are many times the camera would cut to something crazy happening in the background and doesn't take to the time to explain what or why, but instead tells to just go with it. It's ambition alone makes it one of the more refreshing films to come from a person of colors film in the multiplex theater lately.The double edged sword comes from the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. It's hard to describe and hard to process as the film spends much of your time thinking it's a satire but goes one way that makes it even question how we got to this point. It does make the film feel a bit uneven in what the overall message is of the movie, or if director Boots Riley didn't want you to think too deeply in the first place, which would be commendable.Sorry to Bother You will make you laugh and make you squeal at the same time. It's takes advantage of what you think it will be about and turn you upside down.

144,jg_1977,The most original movie of the year,7,14 July 2018,"If I can impart one takeaway from this movie, it would be this: it will surprise you and defy your expectations in almost every way. Writer/director Boots Riley did not hold back when crafting this story, it's clear basically every idea he had went into the script. That both works to its advantage and disadvantage. Because of everything that happens, this movie stays completely unpredictable from start to finish, something I am a big fan of. Where it becomes an issue, is towards the end when so many plot threads have been introduced and the story feels a bit overcrowded. In terms of the humor of the movie, it mostly worked for me. However, I'd say for anyone expecting a comedy, this movie is more of a drama with comedic moments. The message of the movie, which isn't hard to pick up on, is a little heavier and doesn't completely lend itself to the tone of an all out comedy. That being said, the way the humor is delivered was great. In closing, go see this movie with a very open mind, and check your preconceived notions about it at the door.

156,ryandannar,"An inspired, brilliant, and bonkers satire of capitalism run amok!",8,31 July 2018,"Saw this awesome, bonkers indie film on Saturday called ""Sorry to Bother You."" It was one of those rare occasions when I've been able to go into a film knowing little-to-nothing about it. My friend invited me out, told me that the film was sort of a cross between ""Get Out"" and ""Dear White People,"" and that was all I knew. Having seen it, I'd offer a slightly revised assessment: It's more like ""Get Out"" crossed with ""Office Space,"" as filtered through the madness of Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil,"" with more than a dash of inspiration taken from Michel Gondry's charmingly low-fi effects work.That's a mouthful of references there, I know. Trust me, the film more than earns each of those, and more. It is the feature debut of writer/director Boots Riley, a former telemarketer who first made a name for himself as the lead rapper and producer of The Coup, a politically-conscious rap-band from Oakland, CA. One can sense a wealth of life-experience and long-gestating ideas poured into this film. The film is so energetic, original, and irrepressible, it feels as if Riley and his crew had been itching for years to make this feature -- and then, when finally given the chance, held absolutely nothing back. What they have ended up with is a fantastical and deeply funny satire about capitalism run amok.The plot, in a nutshell: Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield) is a black man in his early 20s, low-key, smart but directionless. He lives with his artistic and politically-conscious girlfriend in an apartment in his uncle's garage in Oakland. He needs money! And so, as the film opens, he's applying for a job at RegalView Telemarketing. The interview goes well enough -- the manager essentially tells Cassius they'll hire anyone with a pulse -- and soon Cassius finds himself on the phone, hawking what sounds like a set of encyclopedias.From its opening moments, the film is giving us clues that it's not interested in a realistic depiction of actual life. Cassius's world is strangely exaggerated, a satirical funhouse-mirror reflection of the actual world. For example: When Cassius is in his cubicle at RegalView, the camera often frames him up against the window of an office across the hallway behind him. Through that window, a xerox-machine flashes ominously, paper flies everywhere, and men in suits frantically wave their arms around. This is never commented upon, which is probably why I found it such a delightful and funny flourish.But as funny and as visually inventive as the film is, it finds perhaps its best gimmick in the way it depicts Cassius's phone-calls. When the computer Cassius is using connects him suddenly with a new customer, he's literally dropped out of his cubicle -- desk and all -- into the customer's life, interrupting whatever it was they were doing. He can see them, but they can't see him. This results in some very funny moments, but it's also a brilliant way of illustrating Cassius's emotional response to these calls. Who is he, to be invading these people's lives unwanted? Having worked at a few call-centers myself, I could definitely feel some real-life experience invested into these moments. Cassius adjusts, as he must, to the strange realities of his new job, but he isn't doing very well at it until a co-worker (played by Danny Glover!) tells him that he'll get more sales if he uses his ""white voice."" Cassius thinks about it, then tries it, and naturally finds his success-rate skyrocket.Here again, the film has a very clever gimmick. Rather than have its black actors simply do their best ""white folk"" impersonation, the film actually OVERDUBS their voices with those of white comedians, such as David Cross and Patton Oswalt. If this makes you feel uneasy -- if the blatant replacement of black voices with white ones reads a bit like ""censorship"" -- that is most definitely the point. Fortunately, it's also funny, and so are most of the film's most pointed satirical jabs. This is a politically-minded film which never feels too preachy, because -- like ""Get Out"" -- its social criticisms are wrapped-up in such an entertaining package.There is so much more to this film, I have hardly even scratched the surface. A very satisfying film surely could have been made out of what little plot I have already described. And yet, Boots Riley has not settled for a simple workplace satire. His debut film is bigger, and weirder, than most sane people would probably imagine. Every time you think you've finally got your head around the film, it reveals strange and funny new territory.So the film is, shall we say, ""overstuffed."" That can be a bad thing. I've seen many a film try to pack way too many ideas into a two-hour runtime, only to end up a disorganized mess. What sets ""Sorry to Bother You"" apart, I think, is the thematic unity of the film. As crazy as the film gets -- and it DOES get crazy, taking a turn into science-fiction at the end which might be one turn too many for some viewers -- everything remains very directly related to the film's satirical concerns.It also helps that the film is bolstered by some very strong performances. Lakeith Stanfield is excellent as Cassius, bringing sweet naivite to a role which requires him to, at times, play a man misguided by profit (or its promise) into morally-compromising positions. Tessa Thompson is kinetic as Detroit, Cassius's artistic girlfriend, whose social-conscience will prove (for him) a point of conflict. And Armie Hammer oozes evil cluelessness as Steve Lift, the founder of a ""lifetime-contract housing and employment"" empire called ""WorryFree,"" which is obviously patterned after the American prison system.
 
One other note: If you think you've seen Lakeith Stanfield before, it might be because he was the man abducted in the opening scene of ""Get Out."" Which is a pretty neat meta-connection between the two films.Anyway, I'll readily admit that ""Sorry to Bother You"" is a strange hot mess of a film -- but I think it's an inspired mess, and perhaps even a brilliant one. If you're in the mood for a comedy that might make you think, but will definitely make you go, ""WTF!?"" -- well, this is one to check out.",Sorry to Bother You
157,joelnova93,"Immersive, risk taking. But feels small",7,11 August 2018,"One quote from a review pulled for the movie's trailer said ""Like 'Get Out' but on Drugs"". I definitely agree, and quite possibly the movie may be better enjoyed not sober.Meant-to-be-high movies are immersive; Sorry to Bother You's method is to give the viewers a simple world with simple messages and simple elements, repeated frequently, but not quite the same every time you see it. For example, Tessa Thompson's character Detroit wears earrings she designs herself, and each pair is different every time you see her. More surreal, however, is Lakieth Stanfield's Cassius Green, who carries a picture of a man posing by a car, which appears in different poses and moods according to the events that play out in the film. The little quirks like those are what gives Sorry to Bother You its charm. However, the audience in my theater slightly less than I expected for a comedy. Sorry to Bother You seems to be more weird than funny overall. The movie's world also seems small, as many elements repeat over and over to a fault. For instance, there's a scene where Cassius flips through the tv channels, of which there are only 3. Don't get me wrong, the three channels is an impressive position for the film's theme and message on Monopoly Capitalism, but the rest of the film didn't stretch its legs far enough to off-set the claustrophobia.However, I doubt many critics could provide specific changes to improve the film, and neither could I. It's a unique film that took risks to have its own voice, and I absolutely love it for that fact. If you are still interested in any way, please go see it, as I believe it would be way more fun at the theater than at home.",Sorry to Bother You

""From the sublime to the ridiculous"" may be a well-worn cliché these days but has never been more appropriate.LaKeith Stanfield (Get Out) takes a telemarketing job out of financial necessity and, discovering his ""voice"", climbs the corporate ladder and in turn discovers some disturbing truths.It is perhaps a testament to the Cast that the on-again off-again romantic plot line involving Stanfield and Thompson is the least believable aspect of a film in which voluntary slavery is no longer oxymoronic. Tessa Thompson does her best with the little she has to work with and Armie Hammer is perfectly cast as the antagonistic coke-fuelled captain of industry.Sorry To Bother You is not a perfect film by any stretch. Yet while its oddness may lose some viewers, it is genuinely funny and utterly different. Why not see something you've never seen before.",Sorry to Bother You
160,AnDread_The_Blind,Satire Gone Wild,9,5 January 2019,"How does one begin to describe a movie like this? Funny, satirical, bizarre - a start, but inadequate. What starts out as a smart and outstandingly acted - if seemingly typical - poor man vs corporate exploitation, goes off the rails to become twisted feverdream of existential nightmare, without ever losing its acerbic wit. This tackles heavy social issues but manages to never take itself quite seriously. Perhaps a bit too on the nose sometimes, though it delivers in a totally unique and somewhat absurd way. What a blast.",Sorry to Bother You
161,Yee_Reviews,"Ambitious, Yet Scattered",6,11 May 2018,"Good: The concept was original and different and the first two-thirds of the movie were interesting/engaging. The film is filled with talent from Tessa Thompson to Armie Hammer. But the true standout is Lakeith Stanfield's character who is relatable with his struggles and goal in life of making a difference and mattering in the world. I do like the themes the film tackles like the corruption of big companies with its hunger for power and money.Bad: The film bounces around too much with its subplots. Near the end, the story goes for more of a shock value and the social problems it started to develop gets lost in a bad acid trip. Some of the ideas and characters were not fully developed as a result of the film being fast paced and messy. I personally did not find the jokes funny, but my audience was laughing for the most part.Overall: This film is a political satire so it is not for everyone, however I believe there is a certain crowd that will absolutely admire this film and praise it for its originality and humor. The film juggles too much, but I appreciate Boots Riley's first time directorial debut ambitions.3/5",Sorry to Bother You

More like a dystopian drama but with some bizarre moments that break the tension.It's well done in what it does, but what it does is very similar to Get Out in message and portrayal.I didn't love the twist, personally, and the ending felt super abrupt, but it was still wild, a completely different movie from where it began. It was enjoyable throughout.I only deduct points for the last act feeling extremely rushed and a bit unexplained, and the final ending being a foregone conclusion.However I would absolutely recommend this film. If you like Get Out, you'll like this. Though some will certainly prefer one over the other, and for me, I prefer Get Out.

Stanfield and Fowler, especially, though, were very good. Plus it's always good to see Danny Glover in anything.The film, however, was dreadful. I normally enjoy absurdist humour, but this didn't know when to draw the line. It was strangely paced, too. Plus, is it even possible to watch a Hollywood movie nowadays without them having to ram a political message down our throats? It's mind-numbing, and, dismally, I find myself waiting for the point in every modern film or tv programme when it happens. Unfortunately, when it does, I completely lose all interest in what I'm watching.If you like Monty Python sketches without the humour, you'll enjoy this.

Great use of mise-en-scene to make statements about society and within the plot of the movie. Solid writing, it had alot of funny moments. Interestingly, weird music selection which was perfect for this movie. I felt like other than the main protagonist, Cassius, all of the other characters stories just revolved around him, especially for the main female character Detroit. Her story only mattered when it aligned with Cassius's story, with no character development of her own. I get tired of seeing poorly developed female characters in movies and it sends a message the women's stories don't matter. You would definitely have to see this movie more than once to catch all of the political statements that Boots Riley is trying to make. Overall, I'll give it an 8/10.",Sorry to Bother You

Where do I start first? The narrative that people of color have to conform to society behavioral norms to succeed in the workplace? How big companies use modern-day slave labor for mass production and will do anything to make more profit? The lengths struggling people go in order to get ahead short of selling their soul? Worry-Free corporation in the film may have been a glimpse into what big companies such as google, apple, and amazon may become but I don't want to come off like i'm reaching.

174,Mikheil-H,"Telemarketers, where do they come from anyway?",8,14 November 2020,"We have all been there, doing our daily routines, relaxing until suddenly, we get a ring from an unknown number. We answer and on the other end are the words ""Sorry to bother you"" followed by a sales pitch. However, now, through the eyes of first time writer and director Boots Riley, we get to see how that phone call is formed.Set in alternate present-day America, our protagonist Cassius Green (Lakeith Stanfield) is propelled into the surreal world of telemarketing. However, where his friends and colleagues unite and fight the depressed system, Cassius rises, finding himself in a bizarre world where greed is king and morals come to die. Joining us in this alternate world is Cassius's girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson), a budding political artist with earrings to die for, and Salvador (Jermaine Fowler) who brings Cassius into telemarketing unaware of the insane consequences of that action. The secret to Cassius's telemarketing success comes in the form of the film's comedic highlight of ""the white voice"". This is a term, used by an elder telemarketer, to refer to a voice that sounds like the owner has everything; they are comfortable, they are content, and they want to share that with you.Despite the fairly in-depth review of the plot above, it only scratches the surface of this intricate, complex and fresh interpretation of greatness from poor beginnings. Whilst other films, such as the current Fantastic Beasts outing, fail to balance a multitude of story lines, 'Sorry to bother you' blends its' plotlines together allowing the threads to seamlessly weave in and out of each other, providing the viewer a grand sense of the world it takes place in.Upon release, the film has been harkened back to three pieces of popular media. Firstly, its' themes on race and class relations, especially in the USA, allows 'Sorry to bother you' to be coined as a ""social horror"" being likened to 2017s ""Get Out"". Secondly, by presenting a surreally twisted alternate setting, as well as the worst sides of humanity, the film provides connotations with Black Mirror. Lastly, the third act, with one of the most outrageous and jaw-dropping plot twists of recent times, results in a direct association with the infamous revelation from 1973's Soylent Green. These three inspirations combine to form a funny, intense and beautifully directed film which truly leaves a lot to think about.Despite this, 'Sorry to Bother You' is not for everyone. Even with genius strokes such as costume design, the third act, whilst jaw-dropping for me, will be polarising for others and does have the ability to ruin what has come before. However, whilst it may not claim awards, cult status is ultimately what awaits this marmite gem of a film.",Sorry to Bother You
175,vikascoder,Explosive satire!,9,15 July 2018,"If you thought Get Out was the breakthrough innovative movie which surprised and shocked audiences with a heady mix of horror and genre bending social messaging, then Sorry to Bother You will blow your mind. This is such a meticulously crafted innovative and funny social satire that illuminates and illustrates how corporate greed, general apathy and institutionalized racism has affected the black community so hard. It is also a fiery comment on the state of our society in general. I wonder how this can fly over the head of folks rating his 1 and 2 stars or it is just denial at the sheer virtuosity of directorial control and pointed messaging at display here. This is a brutal tear down of what makes us human and it is not pretty. Anyone who is even slightly tuned to the general zeitgeist will absolutely know what the whole movie and the ending lays out.

To be fair, yeah, it's messed up. I saw the trailer a bunch of times and thought it was just a fun little movie, but it plays like a Spike Lee joint laced with some serious party drugs.

It pretends to be satire when really, it's just preaching to the usual gang. Paul Verhoeven makes satire. This? this has an agenda that can be seen from space. It doesn't need to be a movie since there's nothing cinematic about it. It's television on a big screen; a double episode, let's say. Look at the poster, you know if you want to see it or not.

But in an age of automation and AI that will inevitably gobble up low-skilled jobs and venture onwards and upwards now and into the future. I felt this title seemed a bit behind the times in its satirical commentary. Large corporations will employ robots to do the work and those jobs will not be replaced with humans anymore (let alone horse-people!) Yes, a change in systems that benefits all needs to eventuate or else corporations and a few at the top of the chain will have all the wealth. That's not right. Bit I'm not exactly sure how it all changes. I don't have the answer. But I believe it needs to change to purpose beyond profit and health over wealth for all. That message was in this movie.

189,kim_smoltz,A uniquely American portrait of personal success amidst the flimsy morals of capitalism,7,23 February 2019,"Hilarious, bizarre, and endearing, ""Sorry to Bother You"" is one of the most unique films I've seen in years.Cassius 'Cash' Green (Lakeith Stanfield) is broke, unemployed, living in a garage, and four months behind on rent. He's got an ultra left-wing girlfriend named Detroit (Tessa Thompson) who is an experimental visual artist. When given the opportunity to start a grunt career at a telemarketing company, Cash exceeds all expectations and begins to climb the ladders to the elite telemarketing world. And that's where things get weird. Really weird.This is Oakland, California -- but not the Oakland (or the United States) that we know. Early in the film, it's established that this is somewhat of a parallel universe, a surreal and exaggerated version of our current country. This ""distant but nearby"" environment carries through the film and only gets stronger and more in-your-face, in a surrealist way that almost reminds me of a Tim & Eric sketch. For example, the hottest show on television is a reality show called ""I Got the Sh@t Kicked Out of Me,"" where people are literally beaten for comic effect.There is a whole lot to unpack in ""Sorry to Bother You."" The very relevant American sociopolitical theme is front and center, and the plot revolves around unfair labor practices (although ""unfair"" would be putting it lightly), protests, left-wing resistance, and the complete inefficiency of the U.S. legislature. These familiar issues are then blown up to larger-than-life proportions -- and both hilarity and horror ensues. ""Sorry to Bother You"" asks relevant and difficult questions; as a disenfranchised person, how far will you go in your career despite your moral compass? How much dirty capitalism can you withstand? How much money is worth being a part of something that disgusts you?This is a black comedy, but it's super fun and over-the-top, never losing sight of its razor-sharp wit. There are some scenes that border on upsetting, but this isn't ""Dogtooth,"" so if you're not into black comedies normally, it's still something worth checking out. If you're a fan of dry, surrealist humor, are into left-wing politics, or just fed up with the banality of your work life -- do yourself a favor and watch this movie.Nothing else should be discussed in a review for this movie. I'll leave the rest for your viewing pleasure. Enjoy the ride!",Sorry to Bother You

195,Holland_March,It must be seen to be believed,10,5 May 2021,"Sorry To Bother You is a bizarre, funny, and on occasion horrifying satire. LaKeith Stanfield is amazing as Cash here, his newness to this world makes him a more relatable character and gives the film a good way to introduce us to everything. His slow arc is incredible and painful to watch, but it makes the film all the more better. Detroit adds some humanity to the story and gives Cash a good reason not to do a lot of what he ends up doing. Squeeze is a fun character who always has the best interests in heart. He might be my personal favorite simply because his character is entertaining to watch and his actions set the story into a whole other motion. Sal and Cash have good chemistry and feel like best friends, something very important to the story. Humor is quick but mostly very intelligent. It certainly works as a satire. The white voice is a really creative idea, with a great reason of existing. It was handled really well and tackled the theme of racism in fun way that wasn't too jarring. The dubbing is occasionally off, but it still works really well. The cinematography is really good, there's a lot of beautiful shots and camera movements throughout. The first two acts are amazing, from the style to the comedy, to the actual plot, it's all handled amazingly well by Boots Riley. The final act... it's honestly grown on me a lot. It seemingly throws the rest of the film out the window to instead give us... well, you know what it is if you've seen it. While almost entirely different to the rest of the story, a lot from the first two acts makes a reappearance in great ways that deeply impact the story.

Ended up seeming like a freshman film school effort, which I guess it sort of was. Saddest part is that the clumsy effort at surrealism which had the plot going all adult swim by the end, eclipsed what are some important themic elements about class and race.Worst of all, the production values were even more amateurish than the script. The design was garish, in your face and so lacking any naturalism that it screamed faux throughout. As an example there is an elevator interior so glitzed up that no one could possibly read as an elevator once the door closes. Then the constant use of colored accent lighting made most of the night scenes it look like an anti-drug PSA from the 80's, with the interiors flat and the exteriors even flatter.I'm glad they're making some money so that maybe they can do better next time, as there are obviously some interesting ideas and creativity behind this project, which is also often true of other freshman film school product.

I was correct on all but the straightforward part. This movie moves in directions that you would never see coming, and I truly mean this in the best way possible. The acting in this movie is top notch, from even the smallest of characters. Lakeith Stanfield and Armie Hammer are the two actors that really stood out to me, however, this is not saying to discredit any of the other actors involved. This movie is strange and extremely fast paced. The directing style is unlike any movie I have ever seen, and it moves just fast enough to keep you on your toes while not moving too fast for you to comprehend. There are so many themes within this movie, and all of them are shown within either a comedic context, a darker context, or both. All in all this is a movie about capitalism and how companies are driven to make money rather than care about the well-being of their workers. This is shown through more extreme absurdist examples as the movie goes on, and it just works. The movie is quirky, and there are moments that will have you laughing out loud just at the pure absurdity of what you are witnessing. The writing for this movie is EXTREMELY witty and snappy. Even Terry Crews, who played a very small role, had some great lines. All in all, this movie is extremely unique, it takes huge risks from a directing standpoint, almost tempting people not to like it. It is just so different from any other movie that you can watch that some people will be instantly turned away. For me though, everything in this movie just worked, and I have to say there is a new contender for best movie of the year, in my opinion. Outstanding movie and hope to see much more from Boots Riley (the director) very soon.",Sorry to Bother You

It takes a lot to offend me, having grown up with Kevin Smith, South Park, Family Guy etc and by no means do I conform to the politically correct fad but even on second viewing this movie felt offensive and divisive especially in this day and age where surely we should be aiming for equality and not not divisive race baiting",Sorry to Bother You
204,davedflores,"Sorry to Bother You, only applies to the title",8,19 October 2018,"Sorry To Bother You, the most interesting movie of 2018, starts off going in one direction and takes not only the characters, but its audiences in a complete different direction. Set in Oakland, Ca., Cassius Green is the average American, chasing the dream of success by joining a telemarketing company. After discovering his 'white voice,' Cassius climbs the ranks of the company, bringing him into a life he did not expect at all, selling more than just the average household goods. Cassius is just the business man stuck between the two world of glory and greed, and humility with the working class.
While the movie starts off as a comedy for audiences, feeling like its a relatable story about the average man, it takes a much darker turn.
The film takes your mind for a spin, asking questions like 'what media is consuming the minds of the people' and 'do people realize what is happening around them?'
Boots Riley wrote the film, showing that he can give audience something more than just the average blockbuster. He makes the story progress at a rapid, yet followable pace.
Taking on multiple roles, Boots Riley also takes on directing the film, definitely pulling out a great performance from the actors. He also is able to show the pacing that he had when he wrote the film, very smoothly.
Editing done by Terel Gibson brings to life the world in Cassuis Green's view of the world, from literal things to the way he sees his job as a telemarketer. Something that is done well is the scenes where they transition the time of day by jump cutting a sign from the WorryFree corporation, from clean to tagged with graffiti.
Lastly, Doug Emmett shows the mood very well with his placement of lighting, from darker scenes in the film, to the bright mornings that Cassius wakes up. He uses lighting to highlight the mood that Cassius is in.
While the film was superb, the only difference I would of made was using more of the well known actors, showing their character development, especially Danny Glover.",Sorry to Bother You

(Hoping it could be a better version of Office Space) Finally a movie about life, and how Monotonous, draining, and ironic it can be. Most people feel that way about their jobs, and we can all relate. However, all of a sudden I don't know what happened. Theirs half werewolf/human clones running around fighting each other.

207,elliotgjazz,Sorry to Bore You !,1,8 December 2018,"Hi ELLIOT GJAZZ here, well well well. What can I say. Out of the 50+ movies I,ve seen this year in CINEWORLD, the 2 worst are this and another so called SCI FI Black Comedy DOWNSIZING. STBY was awful, dreadful, annoying,boring, stupid, dire, pointless, and just downright terrible.The story was silly. The characters I didn't care for whatsoever. At some point in the movie some of the actors are dubbed, this is so annoying, why couldn't the actors act and do a different accent. It reminded me of that silly advert on telly right now that has a masculine guy with a squeaky voice. The crux of the story of a guy jumping up the job ladder is just not that believable and went on too long. I was bored and wanted so much to leave , however in order to write a review I had to suffer it. Satirical sci fi n Horror is perhaps a hard thing to write and if you are unable to do this don't. Boots Riley has been compared to the genius SPIKE LEE , I don't think so. Avoid this movie like the plague, or do a mystery science theatre and watch and slag it to hell. What a surprise Mark Kermode loved it! He compared it to two films I loved a lot, the brilliant SOCIETY 1989 and the superb O LUCKY MAN! 1973, not on your nelly Mark. Sci Fi Films you must see that are Comedic, Satirical Dark and wae better, SLEEPER 1973 - DARK STAR 1974 BARBARELLA 1968 - BRAZIL 1985 - BEING JOHN MALKOVICH 1999 - THEY LIVE 1988 - ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK 1981 - MARS ATTACKS 1996 and lastly the hell of a funny FLESH GORDON 1974.

212,coopermcdonald-52056,One of the most entertaining films of the decade.,8,25 February 2020,"In an alternate version of Oakland, California, Cassius Green finds a job as a telemarketer, only to discover the commission paying job to be quite the struggle as a black man trying to sell to predominately white people over the phone. This changes when a veteran telemarketer advises him to use his ""white voice"", which makes his attitude more appealing to the customers. With this bizarrely high-pitched and flamboyant accent, Cassius becomes a huge success as his job, right as his colleagues form a union to improve their miserable jobs. Regardless, Cassius finds himself promoted to a ""Power Caller"", where he started selling the most morally abhorrent but lucrative products and services as his connection to his girlfriend and colleagues slip away. However, Cassius' conscience arises anew as he finds himself in the midst of his boss' bizarre world of condescending bigoted decadence and his sinister plans to create the perfect subservient work force with Cassius' help.
This film is filled with a truly outstanding cast. Lakieth Stanfield is given the lead as Cassius Green, and he does a phenomenal job. Stanfield is usually acting in more minor and supportive roles, so it is awesome to see him fully unleashed as the lead. Tessa Thompson stars as Detroit, Cassius' girlfriend. She is definitely one of the stranger characters in the movie, and Tessa Thompson delivers that weirdness with beautiful expertise. I cannot imagine another actress with this role. Other big faces act in smaller roles including Steven Yeun as Squeeze, and Terry Crews as Sergio, Cassius' uncle.
Aesthetically, the film adopts a visual style obviously influenced by Michel Gondry, and, to a lesser extent, Terry Gilliam. An especially interesting aesthetic device, as anyone who has seen the trailer can attest, is how white voice is handled - rather than having the actors simply speak in a different voice, Riley instead has the white actors' voices overdubbed; when Cash's friend Salvador first hears Cash's white voice, he literally tells him ""you sound overdubbed"". However, the lip syncing is, presumably intentionally, far from perfect, with the voice not quite aligning with the actors' mouth movements. This throws the scenes ""off"" ever so slightly, creating an extra layer of surreality, and highlighting just how absurd the whole thing is, drawing attention to the lengths these people have to go to achieve real success. The fact that our culture places such value on ""correct"" intonation is, in and of itself, absurd, like an extreme version of the phone voice that pretty much everyone has, and by failing to perfectly sync white voice to black actor, Riley is able to deconstruct and draw attention to this absurdity.
The film's other big aesthetic innovation is having Cash plunge (not especially gracefully) into the living room of the people he calls, desk and all. Obviously, this draws attention to the level of intrusion with which most people greet telemarketers, but, at least in the early stages, it also highlights Cash's own discomfit at being the intruder, seen most clearly when he drops in on a couple having sex. This is an excellently-handled piece of visual shorthand, conveying Cash's internal process, without having him verbalise it at any point.
A black comedy/Juvenalian satire/science fiction/horror/magic realist/allegorical character study, Sorry to Bother You is impossible to classify. Dealing with the obstacles facing African Americans in a white-dominated corporate milieu, and positing that the experience of workers is determined by both labor conditions and race, the film examines labour relations, wage issues, worker solidarity, unionism, mass media, and the dangers of betraying oneself and choosing corporate advancement over friendships, relationships, and personal integrity. Although it's a beat or two too long, and although the spectacularly bizarre left-turn at the end of the second act will surely alienate a lot of viewers, the deconstruction and comic appropriation of code-switching results in a film that is constantly inventive, highly confrontational, and extremely funny. Sorry to Bother You is one of the most underrated movies of the decade. This is one of my favorite movies, as it is incredibly well done and has an A tier cast. I am giving Sorry to Bother You a 7.9/10.",Sorry to Bother You
213,judeknicks,"Overrated, lacks focus and message gets lost",5,16 July 2018,"Many times, movies that don't deserve to be critically lambasted (i.e. King Arthur: Legend of the Sword) end up being critically lambasted. Simultaneously, movies that don't deserve critical praise (i.e. Wonder Woman) end up receiving a heap of critical praise. When I see movies receive critical praise, I become more interested in seeing them. I know I said that I don't check reviews, but every time I get on the internet its hard to avoid seeing such content.I unfortunately saw reviews and commercials that raved about how good and true Sorry To Bother You was. It was described as a fresh, relevant, and hilarious take on the sci-fi/comedy genre that meant so much to what events are transpiring in our world today. I'm guessing that, based on the director, actors involved, and just just watching the commercials seeing Lakeith Stanfield doing a ""white voice"", it had something to do about race. Whatever it's hidden message about racial equality was, it got lost behind direction that was non-parralel almost on a Gotti level and a crazy twist that was a major WTF. I don't think the twist had anything to do with our modern world; if it did, then i missed it completely.I will first begin with good things since this is a negative review that should end with the bad. The good aspects included Lakeith Stanfield's standout performance as the main character Cassius ""Cash"" Green. He was able to transition from a non-social loser who carries himself as a timid individual to an entitled selfish prick when he earns the promotion. That is not a spoiler; it is explicitly in the trailers that he moves up the ladder in his job. He does a great job in creating a character that makes us think about how we would become if we were to leave behind our friends and beliefs in pursuit of wealth and personal gain. It made me beg the question as well, even though the situation Cash was in is definitely unrealistic. It is a movie after all. Stanfield's performance along with the rest of the cast is the main standout moment in the movie. That about does it. Time to move on to the bad stuff.In my opinion, just about everything else with this movie is bad. The directing is misguided and all over the place, which is also bad credit towards the editing. The transitions between each scene make the film feel that it was made using Microsoft PowerPoint slides. All these different fades and transition effects are misplaced, which is distracting and harms the focus that viewers should be placing on the movie. The directing isn't the only bad thing; the overall message and plot of the film is unknown. I have no idea what the movie is trying to say about ""white voice"" and ""black voice"". As established in the trailers, Cash is able to move up the echelon of importance in his workplace by using his ""white voice"" to have his phone clients pay attention to him. He seems to move up the ladder very fast, but the film loses whatever message it was trying to parlay from there. Many of these films that criticize race relations in our nations only point out issues with African-Americans, and they seem to be exaggerated. It can get annoying when people continue to complain about issues by being preachy in entertainment only; it takes away from the joy of entertainment.After I walked out of the theatre, I was very disappointed with the film. There was so much hype surrounding it that I could not avoid any press or reviews. I tried to, as they have altered my expectations in the past, but I could not avoid it. I myself had been interested in seeing the movie after watching the trailers; the premise looked interesting, and I am a big fan of Lakeith. However, the message of the film was not clear to me. It got lost within a large array of unnecessary content that did not push the film forward. There is one major shocking and disturbing twist at the end, and all I have to say about that is WTF.Overall, I would say that this movie is not worth your $20, $12, $2, or your time. If you never watch it, you won't miss a thing. Rating wise, I would give Sorry To Bother You 5 stars out of 10. Just don't.",Sorry to Bother You

217,popcornandfizz,A bona fide classic waiting to happen,9,7 February 2019,"Sorry to Bother You is such an aesthetically pleasing film. It was made on a relatively small budget of $3.2 million, yet it looks as good as and better than ones which multiply that number twentyfold. It's not how much you have, it's how you use it. Superlative visuals aside, the film also boasts some exceptional tunes which are to be expected of Riley, who has never made a film before (he has always been a musician).As a comedy that reads as a working class manifesto, there are two things that had to be nailed for the film to come out well: humor and interesting themes. Sorry to Bother You is right on the money with both. Comedy is a tricky, subjective thing, but I found it to be a damn funny film that was absurd enough to elicit laughs regularly but not so much that the more thematic elements came out worse off through tonal whiplash. The performances and dialogue accentuate the humor, with some great delivery from all of the cast, including Stanfield, Thompson, David Cross, Patton Oswalt, and Terry Crews.Sorry to Bother You is the type of film that will find itself in the sights of both the ""everyone on the left is a socialist"" far right and pseudo-woke pseudo-centrists with thorns up their asses from fence-sitting their whole lives. But it's also the kind of film that someone truly progressive would adore, as it presents such a complex web of how our corrupt system corrodes society in such an easy to understand fashion. While some may critique the film for a ""lack of subtlety"", you cannot have subtlety when depicting such a total portrayal of our country. And it's not as though subtlety is some innately positive quality in art. Sorry to Bother You is such an intelligent film, I can't help but love it for that alone.Narratively, I've seen some people taking umbrage with a turning point towards the end of the story. Now, I came in knowing what happens thanks to the Just Write video, but I implore anyone who has not seen the film yet but is interested to go in without knowing if you want a surprise. Personally, I don't think I would've been turned off by that revelation had I come in unawares, because the rest of the film before it is already so gonzo that it's not really jumping the shark in my opinion. Where other films are politically ""woke"" and also happen to be funny, the beauty of Sorry to Bother You is in how it perfectly melds both social commentary and humor in a way that the two cannot be separated.Sorry to Bother You is a bona fide classic waiting to happen; a perfect counterweight and antidote to the overexposure of Ayn Rand's nauseating Atlas Shrugged. I hope to be there as it grows in popularity with time. My only problems with it, which are only really marginal issues, are that some of the jokes don't land with me (your mileage may vary). Other than that, this is a flick that's firing on all cylinders and provides progressives with something bafflingly fun to chew on. Sorry to Bother You gets a 9.5/10 from me.Must-seeSummary:

Four well known very talented actors with Terry Crews, Omari Hardwick, Danny Glover, and Forrest Whitaker gave a lot of credibility to this movie but only to disappoint and leave me scratching my head wondering why they would ever take these roles in such an oddball ""D"" movie that never should have made it out of anyone's head onto paper let alone as a movie release.If you watch the Trailer you will get far more entertainment in those 2 or 3 minutes than spending the time and money to sit in the theater for 2+ hours trying to figure out how this movie got a 7.4 on IMDB.

It isn't a disaster and it isn't a success. 5 stars for being right on the middle of everything else.From a film school standpoint, it has good potential to build characters and show story arc. It fails to make that happen on a solid premise. Creating an absurd alternate reality just tells the viewer ""hey this movie is not based on reality!"". The cast feels like extras. No need to care about them.The viewer is left wondering what the heck is happening, because it has nothing to do with reality, so the characters have no depth, and the arc goes nowhere. Well, I guess it goes to the end. It really is one of those movies where it ends and you are like, whatever, I'm not gonna hate on it, just move on to something good. What is next?

256,PopeyeTheSailor,"For better or for worse, not an average film",5,5 April 2020,"Off the top I'll say that I personally don't consider this movie ""good"" according to my own tastes. I felt that the acting besides Danny Glover to be unbelievable, the story to be cheesy/preachy, and the forced imagery to be eye-rolling akin to Spike Lee's post-2010 work. I'll also further say that if you have conservative views or just don't like overtly leftist material, DEFINITELY avoid this. You're just wasting your time watching it and for your own blood pressure, don't even bother reading the rest of this review. The story/script isn't strong or clever enough like RoboCop, Dawn of the Dead, etc. to subvert its anti-Capitalist themes for right wing audiences that may be stubborn on having their views challenged. Not saying this is right or wrong, but it's a fact regardless.If it's relevant, I want to say that I have a lot of the same stances as STBY's director, Boots Riley, myself being an African-American who has grown very skeptical of neoliberal capitalism. If you are someone who is passionate about political subjects like imperialism, American socioeconomic relations, etc. this is where the movie can shine in my eyes and why I decided to finish the film despite genuinely not enjoying it. Its subject is extremely relevant and actually rather important on how culturally manipulative a destructive economic system can be. Although written sloppily in my view, it does cover many topics that I find necessary to address in this time and age.The problem with the movie isn't its heart, it's the components. All of leads give average or subpar performances. Tessa Thompson is beautiful to look at, but I've never been a fan of her acting and here she plays another boring exaggerated extension of herself. Fowler and Yeun were alright in their respective roles, but Hardwick was extremely cringe in his appearances. The white antagonists were equally bad as their Black and Asian counterparts, delivering doctrine in their lines rather than subversive dialogue. These things wouldn't be as much an issue under a visual visionary building strong characters but I was damn near about to turn it off until Glover sold me on the movie's concept in his monologue to Stanfield. At this point, this is where I found it amusing for the reasons stated earlier.Unlike some friends who rated the movie lower than me, I actually did find the twist to be one of the movie's few strong points despite how weird it is. I like the fact that the movie has a unique voice and takes risks storytelling-wise. Perhaps if the buildup to this revelation was stronger, I would have enjoyed the movie. But in addition to the writing, acting, and I guess even the directing... I gotta say that I wasn't a fan of the editing either. Several transitions seemed sudden and awkwardly comical.Overall, I don't ever see myself giving this movie another viewing. The writer definitely has a lot to say and the preachyness at least avoids ""Bright""-level stupidity. (a far worse anti-racist sci fi film) However, I can't with any good faith put this movie in the recommended category.",Sorry to Bother You

258,idennis32,"Starts off strong, ends poorly.",6,3 May 2018,"I had high hopes for this movie and it fullfills half of it. I saw this at a special screening in Baltimore Parkway theatre yesterday and I still can't believe how strong the first of the movie is and how it gets derailed so quickly.The movie is about Cassius Green, a man who gets a telemarketing job and rising to the ranks using his ""white voice"". The concept alone lets people know the film deals with themes of identity. But this theme is tarnished by the big plot twist.SPOILER ALERT: The big twist is that the telemarketer's goal is to mutate workers into horse like beings in order to use them as labor and control them by making them snort this capsule that can be mistaken for cocaine. Sounds silly right? Because it is. None of that made sense literally came out of left field and you have to deal with for the last 30minutes - hour of the movie. And the ending has Cassius turn into the horse like being and come and destroy the big bad guy's mansion. It totally ruins the previous themes and becomes a weird, forced sci-fi movie. It's as if the director wanted to mash Get Out with District 9 together. It just doesn't work.The movie overall is hilarious. Literally the movie is PACKED with jokes from start to finish. The dubbing of the ""white voice"" is odd as sometimes the actors expressions and the voice don't match up. The animatronics are horrendous like TMNT 3 Bad. But the real crime is how they ditched this really thematic angle of the story dealing with identity crisis and how Cassius is selling out to ""the man"" due to his greed and traded it for a weird sci fi scene about mutation and how they're making slaves out of us. Although creative, the film suffers from its storytelling and for that it gets a 6/10. There's much to enjoy but you'll end up confused in the end.",Sorry to Bother You

It abhorrently lacks so much. This movie is a dumpster fire. I have never seen a movie this bad before in my life. It completely fails to entertain at alllllll. It graphically shows disturbing things that take you out of the movie and want your time and money back. It's dark, it's gritty, distasteful, disturbing, inappropriate, disgusting and unmistakably bad. I don't understand how anyone could have supported making this movie. I would give a zero if I could.

261,Yeary72,Curvy Weird Ride,6,27 July 2018,"Sorry to Bother You is a movie that starts strong but takes a few missteps along a way and ends on rocky note. This movie is Boots Riley's premier Directing role. And for his first time in the directing chair and sole writer he does a fine job. This movie is unique in many ways big very bland in others. No Spoliers here but to say some plot lines and characters get very one note is an understatement. They become very generic at times and sometimes boring. Or just trail off and not really have a purpose in the big picture of the movie. But not to say the movie has fun times. The entire movie has this fun spunky vibe that really makes you feel for the main character. Others around him not so much but the main actor here does a good job and really makes you feel for him. The ladder half of the movie is when it feels the movie kinda dragged for me. It takes some weird twists and turns that were a little far fetched but the entire story before it has been setting up weird things and events so it wasn't to off putting. It's just where the story decides to go is where it got boring. Last 30ish minutes seem very by the numbers and generic where the first 30ish minutes of the movies is orignal, funny, and interesting. Overall it is a Okay (6) movie. Though I do believe in some parts it goes beyond ok. The ending drags down the movie and makes it an ok experience that I do actually recommend. The beginning and weird funky nature of the movie made it more enjoyable then an average summer comedy/fantasy movie.

It starts off whimsical and smart, and clearly attempts to make a racial statements about African Americans and corporate America. Unfortunately the second half of the movie makes a turn for the unhinged and fails to see any of the 1st act themes through.The cast assembled should put on a better performance than it does, but aside from a hand full of scenes the performances are underwhelming.Visually, the film pidgeon-holes itself as an art film and ignores the beauty of filming in the picturesque bay area. In fact if the characters didn't mention Oakland as often as it did the audience may not even realize the location.Character development is lacking, and the film would stand to benefit from exploring the origins of these characters.Bottom line: the movie bites off more than it can chew, and unravles into lunacy.

I loved all the underlying political commentary, such as the ""white person voice"" and the hilarious scene where Lakeith Stanfield raps, commenting on the audience in hip hop. However, the stupid, terrible CGI horse people brought this film to a grinding halt. What was the point here? I'm sure there's some ""corporations treat us like animals maaaannnnn"" themes but that is incredibly shallow compared to the rest of the weird quirks this world contained.

Things I didn't like? Well I hate the editing. The dissolves are really out of place and weird, and some of the other ""tricks"" are pretty amateur. The ""white voice"" got really grading really fast and was out of sync often.

When it decides to become surrealist near the very end of the film it falls off the rails very quickly especially seeing as the film does just decide to end rather happily and optimistically.
A film with the type of tone it has and the morally confused main character does not lead itself well to an ending that we got. Also, the ending makes everything that I just watched feel empty and pointless. Yes, things change but not in a satisfying way or even in a morbidly curious way. It just ends.

It takes strange twists and turns, all while saying interesting things and presenting something thought provoking.STBY is about Cassius ""Cash"" Green, a man who just needs to make a buck at his horrible telemarketer job and just get by. After finding he has a talent for sales while using his ""white voice"", he's propelled to the upper echelon of elite salespeople at the company. But that's just the first act. Any more and I'll spoil what this film has in store for you. The pace of it all is very quick and kept me wondering what could happen next. Every time I thought I knew where it was going, it jerked me into another dimension. The only gripe I had with the story is that the side plot of the friend who is trying to get with his girlfriend seems totally unnecessary. It could be taken out of the movie completely and nothing would be different. The acting is great, with all the actors either embracing the insanity or not knowing what exactly to do with it. Everyone is fun to watch and see how they would react to their new situations.The cinematography was excellent. From the first act and how dull and drab and out of focus everything is due to our main character's disinterest in his life and job, to the second act's sharp clarity where he is focused on doing the best he can at his job. The third act feels like a dream where everything is bright but hazy. There's a lot of great subtle visual metaphors throughout that make it fun to analyze as well. I would love to watch this again and see what I missed.The soundtrack for this is just as trippy and weird. Lots of loops and weird instrumentation can be heard. Some members of the band Tune-Yards do the composition and it really does show. It keeps the kooky and psychedelic atmosphere alive.Aside from some wonky ""white voice"" lip sync and the one story gripe, this is an awesome movie.

The film does not fit within the demographic of most movie reviewers, however, this picture paints a vivid portrait of what could be possible in a not so distant future. This may be hard to digest for some moviegoers, but if one goes in with the perspective of what can and what does happen on a daily basis for many living in the United States, the film is not as far-fetched as it can appear. There are elements of cinematic brilliance in scenes of transformation as the character Cassius Green as he progresses through the movie. The sheer normalcy of poverty is exhibited with brilliance, the essences of beauty are brought from Oakland and projected on to the film expertly. The comedic elements are delivered with skill and are abundant. This comedy melds elements from films such as Idiocrasy, They Live, and the Office. Yet adds a sense of genuine artistic elements that is otherwise lacking from the aforementioned films. There is a raw nature to Boot's film which can be attributed to lack of experience, but as a whole, the film and its cast delivered a performance that was on par with the cult classics named above.

291,djbattick,Hmm,7,21 October 2018,"I always try to base my judgement of a film, on how much it can bring forth my emotions. The more a film can invoke my feelings the; whether that be love, fear or joy. That is what makes a movie great. I have stuck to that rule my whole life, and whether I am feeling in awe at another Nolan epic, or pure bitter frustration at sharknado 13, I have never stumbled across a single film to which I can make an exception.That was in fact until I embarked on the journey known as ""sorry to bother you"".This film is strange. I mean, reallyyy strange. A dystopian reality is constructed, using cheerful and colourful, mise-en-scene, picture and sound; as a poorly crafted mask to cover the dark undertones which hide in plain sight. The acting? Seamless. The humour? Hilarious. The plot? A positive unorthodox. And yet what emotion of mine does this film invoke? Misery.The alternative reality conjured is so surreal, yet so real. The psychopathic nature of every single aspect of this creation bears all too many similarities to the world we too live in. So hyperbolized, so ridiculous, but still so true. Immediately after whatching this film I had to call my best friend, just to hear a sane voice, as even the one in my own head was failing to provide me that comfort.This film does exactly what it sets out to do, it does so in stupendous fashion. And yet, I hated it. I recommended that none of my friends watch it. Though smiling throughout, my overall emotion was of such discomfort, that I really did not want anybody to go through the same. This is the best worst film I have ever seen. My rating has fluctuated from 4-10 throughout the writing of this review. But here you have it. 7/10. My final answer, a mediocre score, for a far from mediocre film.",Sorry to Bother You

Boots Riley is not afraid to take his message to its absurdist extreme; he knows that film and fiction are more than just the mundanities of the real world. You will not see him resort to melodrama to convince the viewer as lesser new filmmakers on the scene have been doing. Riley understands the unique opportunities available to telling a story through the medium of film: live action, animation, comedy, drama, clever scene transitions, bold use of color, amazing original music, all on display here. Lakeith Stanfield as usual does a fantastic job of letting you understand his character. The soundtrack by The Coup only enhances how much of a creative explosion this film is. It's not perfect; some jokes could be rewritten and a couple scenes could have been streamlined, but in the end this is one of the most original films of the year.

The female protagonist is a radical feminist that has an art exhibit, which of course, is centered on Africa and how EVERYTHING comes from there.
To progress socially and professionally one must act white, literally. Of course, when the black protagonist does it he is deemed as Uncle Tom and a sellout. Plus, he has to make fun of other black people.

However this film's progression is perfect and right when you're wondering what could happen next you get hit in the chest with a complete curve ball. It is not predictable and startled me at first. In the end, the film comes full circle and leaves the audience with a suitable ending but also left me wanting to know what happens next. The mise en scene of the film is very detailed and I got the impression that there are subtle meanings hidden under the main plot. There are sub plots about minor character that further the main plot about Cassius but some characters make a big point or affect Cassius then disappear. The editing style of this film normal of most movies and uses lots of temporal and continuity editing the progress the timeline in the film. Overall, I was expecting a boring film about telemarketers but after watching this film I had to take 5 minutes to think about what I just watched. If you are into exploring films with a deeper meaning and want to think about the message behind a film I would recommend this one. However, if you are just looking for a film to put on and kinda watch then i would not suggest this. From a film standpoint, this is 10/10 and as an overall rating I would give it a 8.5/10 because its not for everyone.",Sorry to Bother You

Reading the reviews, I see that it's not everyone's cup of tea. But I thought it was great.This movie was modern, but it was a throw back to the crazy movies of the 60's and 70's.

309,HenryChampion,A hypnotic trip into the capitalistic abyss,8,16 July 2018,"Few films have captured the current zeitgeist with style and efficacy. Fewer filmmakers have done so with a unique and resonating voice. Longtime musician and first time film director Boots Riley has checked all of the above boxes in crafting one of the year's standout movies, Sorry To Bother You. Working from a foundation of biting social satire, Riley infuses urban art and hip hop culture with comedy, blaxploitation, dystopian sci-fi and psychedelia. In between the laughs and the gasps, STBY covers a lot of serious ground allegorizing among other things: capitalism, commercialism, class warfare, cultural appropriation and good ol' existential angst in the 21st century. A perfectly cast Lakeith Stanfield turns in a witty and complex performance as Cassius Green, a disillusioned and struggling Oaklander who finds his niche and sense of purpose in telemarketing. He rapidly ascends from lowly cubicle drone to the high rank of ""power caller"" by way of sales hits and his mastery of the ""white voice."" The newly acquired wealth and stature drip with white collar filth. His supervisory escort to the grand upstairs offices is appropriately named Diana DeBauchery (but pronounced day-boo-cherry). The doors of opportunity open as Cassius is introduced to gatekeepers of knowledge and seduction. An enigmatic, one-eyed fellow (Omari Hardwick) with the gift of the white voice - and whose name is curiously beeped out - represents the only other black man amongst a sea of white. Dark secrets of the corporate underbelly are laid bare by a gluttonous CEO Steve Lift (Armie Hammer). A sequence at a ravenous house party hosted by Lift recalls images of depraved self-indulgence in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. Of course no social satire is complete without a revolt by the masses, in this case a unionized strike by the underpaid and overworked telemarketing minions. Leading the working class cohorts are Cassius's friends Squeeze (Steven Yuen) and Salvador (Jermaine Fowler), along with Cassius's artist girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson). Relationships are tested and the line of betrayal is drawn as Cassius crosses violent picket lines and continues to climb the ladder. It's through this ideological clash that STBY really establishes its narrative crux: Stand up or sell out.The film also functions with the inner-city backdrop of Oakland and its lengthy rows of homeless camps juxtaposed with ubiquitous media ads and absurdist programming maintaining an induced state of escapism. Creatives struggle to find clarity and fortitude on the social justice front evidenced by Detroit's art gallery performance of bizarre crucifixion. Sorry To Bother You is a mind-bending, hilarious and nightmarish jaunt into an alternate America we fear and an all-too-familiar America we loathe. Racial norms are challenged, white privilege is parodied, and corporate hierarchy is underscored in the vein of such films as Putney Swope, Trading Places and White Man's Burden. Riley stumbles at times especially in the final act trying to navigate the oddities while still keeping it somewhat real. Despite the occasional misfires, he has put together an entertaining, intelligent and important film that encapsulates these times from the working poor's perspective. It's early to say, but Sorry To Bother You seems destined for midnight cult movie screenings at an art house near you.",Sorry to Bother You

The cast is good, the acting is good, the dialogue, the way it's shot... I had no idea what it was going to be about and it certainly went places I wasn't expecting it to. It was delving in to areas that I'm particularly interested in these days and I thought I had hit the jackpot with it, until I got to the end and I was left feeling like I'd been slightly cheated.Or maybe not. I'll have to let it sink in. I just feel that to end on a happy resolution was somewhat of a cop out. It felt like one of thos movies where the bad guy gets killed at the end, and the sun comes back out. But the issue in real life is one that isn't going away.Finally, my one issue with the film was the use of the term ""white voice"".

Which on one hand serves well the somewhat wtf claimed atmosphere and on the other, despite a fairly impressive cast, results in not so funny situations which makes it difficult to keep the room in suspense until the final clap.

BUT, I would be shocked if in 10-15 years it hasn't developed an intense cult following. This movie was unforgettable. The jokes worked. The politics were genuinely interesting. It brings you to surprising places as a viewer. I have a really hard time overlooking the stumbles of a first-time director with what was probably a limited budget and schedule, I have to be honest about its flaws.

Very artistic, the story had an important, clear message, that flowed perfectly. The transition of time through out the movie was brilliant, and transition scene resembled those of Scott Pilgrim.

The film's underlying commentary is so overtly subtle, as is the humor. It almost crosses the line to cheesy/slapstick-ish, but is presented so expertly by the film crew and cast, it ends up being a notable quality of the film overall.I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie.

There's a very real and serious message about rampant capitalism, oppression, classism, and race. The message is delivered with quirky humour broken up with moments of seriousness and subtle absurdity.
Then, there is the final act which like others have said appear to have been written and directed by an entirely different person. While the message remains the same, the humour and subtle absurdity is abandoned and you are slapped in the face with it. It ruined an otherwise amazing movie for me.

That was already unreal to take the movie as if it could be based on real life experiences.

This governmental branch was responsible for the creation and distribution of less-than-subtle political propaganda which was disseminated through the media and performing arts in order to push an agenda onto the general population. Agitprop is a perfect descriptor for Sorry To Bother You.Sorry follows Cassius Green (LaKeith Stanfield), a broke, working class black man living in his uncle's garage. When Cassius' artist and activist girlfriend Detroit (Tessa Thompson) expresses concern for their financial situation, Cassius finds work at RegalView, a telemarketing firm. Cassius' initial efforts prove unfruitful until a veteran telemarketer instructs him to use his ""white voice"". Stanfield's own voice is dubbed over by a squeaky-clean white accent, and this magically allows him great success with sales.
Cassius learns of a mega-corporation named WorryFree which offers secure work and housing in exchange for a lifetime contract of labour. However, there is growing concern that employees of WorryFree are being used as slave labour. WorryFree is RegalView's biggest client, which causes a worker's union to be formed at RegalView, which Cassius is roped into. He leads a small protest which is quickly stopped by the higher-ups in RegalView who, instead of punishing Cassius, promote him on the basis of his sales figures.
Cassius begins to climb the job ladder and becomes successful, choosing to remain ignorant of the issue of WorryFree. This creates a conflict between him and Detroit and his fellow workers. Soon, Cassius has risen the ranks to the top and is dealing directly with the CEO of WorryFree, Steve Lift (Armie Hammer). Cassius discovers a dark secret about the nature of WorryFree's workers and joins a growing revolution to protest the evil corporations.Sorry has exactly the level of nuance you'd expect from activist/rapper turned first time writer/director Boots Riley - not much. His script is clumsy, messy, and schizophrenic. Riley's approach appears to be 'throw it all at the wall and see what sticks', except that the content that doesn't stick is picked up and glued onto the wall by Riley anyway. The film is a jumble of many different and conflicting stylistic choices, and in trying so hard to be important and original, it only appears desperate and trite.
The film is billed as a comedy and a satire, however there is very little humour to be found, and the jokes function on the basis of eliciting a feeling of guilt and shame from any audience member who doesn't align themselves with the twisted worldview of Riley and his film's characters.The void left by the absence of humour is instead filled with an insipid cocktail of half-baked political messages. For example, Cassius finds that climbing the job ladder and just generally participating in a capitalist economy sucks the life out of him. The solution? A socialist revolution, obviously. Hardly surprising when Riley has outwardly expressed support for socialist dictator of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro on social media.
The central gag and plot device of the ""white voice"" particularly leaves a sour taste. Imagine if the races were reversed, and a run-of-the-mill white man learns to put on his most stereotypical ""black voice"" in order to become influential in a black community / workplace. A film such as that would rightly be denounced as offensive, however the message that Sorry is peddling is that racial stereotyping is a one-way street.By the time the film finally reaches its third act, Riley decides that being on the nose wasn't quite getting the message across, so he decides to ditch the pen and instead bludgeon your skull with his literary sledgehammer. This final act is so clunky, disjointed, and immature that what was intended as a gear-shift feels more like riding in an altogether different vehicle.
We finally meet Steve Lift, the evil CEO of WorryFree, and Armie Hammer gives a ridiculous pantomime performance as the coked-up evil capitalist. Boo! Hiss! Cassius is struggling to socialise with the patronising, soulless high-ups (all white) and a very long and uncomfortable scene plays out in which Riley has Cassius repeatedly sing a particular racial slur, any deeper meaning to this moment is lost in the deafening noise of Riley's smug self-righteousness. Riley decides to cash in all his ""weird and quirky"" chips and has Cassius discover an army of poorly-rendered CGI human/horse hybrids, a cack-handed attempt at a metaphor for what he views to be the result of labour under capitalism. At this point, I was expecting to see Karl Marx rapping over the credits.The irony of Riley peddling such messages is that his heroes too are devoid of humanity. Stanfield as Cassius is unlikeable, indifferent, and constantly mumbling and lazy-eyed. Detroit is shallow and reduced to a human vessel for a political agenda. Their friend and coworker Squeeze exists purely as a plot device.Perhaps Riley believes that his ability to get this film produced was as a result of years of activism and an established career in music. It isn't. A film carrying messages such as this was only made because the industry in which it was birthed into is already heavily saturated in the very same political biases and agendas. Riley must think that Sorry is a rebellious work of art with a unique voice that dares to shout above the crowd, but it's really just another confusing whimper into the echo chamber. It therefore comes as no surprise that the majority of critics and audiences look favourably upon it. They're all too happy to endorse this twisted piece of agitprop.",Sorry to Bother You
408,willsinclairmarshall,Not for everybody and that's why you should watch it,9,8 January 2021,"This is so bizarre and yet it's how close that it skirts to reality that makes it so uncomfortable.
Lots of people won't like this film (evident from the reviews) but that absolutely shouldn't stop you watching it. You should avoid watching any trailers or reviews for fear of spoiling it, and they honestly won't give you a clue what it's about anyway.
For a Directorial debut it's also fairly stunning, despite (or because of?) the unhinged third act, and the entire cast nail it. It's all very confusing and marvellous for it. Terry Gilliam fans will be excited from the off.

I found the plot twists surprising in the moment, but logical upon reflection. Well, most of them, anyway. 
The penultimate twist, revealed when the wrong door is opened, to the movie in a completely different direction... but again, upon reflection, what is the ultimate end when crony capitalism is unchecked and the 99% are crushed by the weight of lionization of profit and return?

426,imsbs,My Type of Movie,7,16 December 2018,"Sorry to Bother You is anything but a bad time. This fantastic absurdist comedy was an extravagantly unique experience. From its unique style and presentation, to its consistently pleasant humor, its well delivered social commentary, and of course its masterful descent into madness, this film undoubtedly achieves what it set out to be. Demonstrating competent direction and a prominent style, I feel this movie's director, Boots Riley, has a promising future in the film industry, coming off of such a successful directorial debut.Starring Lakeith Stanfield as protagonist Cassius Green, this film is set in an alternate reality of present-day Oakland, California. Cassius Green is a telemarketer, and by learning to speak with a ""white voice,"" he sees massive success in his career. Meanwhile, his friends and co-workers are protesting the exact company that Cassius sees he has a chance at. When promoted to a ""Power Caller,"" he takes that chance, and begins to head down another road. In his case, he went straight up Materialism Avenue. Cassius has a dilemma. Should he continue to live his life as an irredeemable, but wealthy man, or should he redeem himself in the eyes of his friends and co-workers?This film is truly enjoyable. And while this film is great, no film is flawless. I noticed that there were several moments where what was said on screen caused me to cringe. I found the scene in which Cassius goes on a tangent on how the Sun is going to explode to be particularly egregious when it comes to inducing cringe. I also found the technical aspects to be a bit rough around the edges. But of course, nothing is perfect.Where this movie outdoes itself, though, is in its smooth and entrancing journey to insanity. The escalations in the absurdism of this film were never forced or jarring, despite extreme differences between nearing the end of it and the beginning. Of course there was one particularly jarring scene, but it happens to be the exception, in that, this scene was intended to throw off the viewer, and its jarring nature was likewise completely intentional. Anyone who has watched this movie will recognize the scene in particular I am referring to.Sorry to Bother You does not disappoint. I recommend anyone who enjoys absurdist comedies watch this movie, and that they try it on for size. Even though there are so many individual parts of this movie that enthrall me, none are as prominent throughout this film as one thing; it exudes a unique style. If Boots Riley can consistently match the pungency of this film's aura with any upcoming projects, he may just form his own cinematic niche. Ultimately, I score Sorry to Bother You an 7/10. Thank you for reading, have a nice day.",Sorry to Bother You

None of us knew anything about this movie going in other than it had something to do with telemarketing and was highly rated online. Afterwards, we had to go get some ice cream and sit down for a bit to scream and process what the hell we just watched.This movie is a surreal fever dream that has a few great scenes and something interesting to say about the socio-political atmosphere of the US right now, but is mostly just a total mindscrew of a movie with no real purpose or direction. The whole movie is confusing, feels like it's 4 hours long, and the goddamn horse-people freaked me out so much I felt like I was gonna have nightmares.I'm honestly really conflicted about this movie because it took some really interesting risks and clearly had some thought put into it, but it took such a bizarre turn that I genuinely feel like I can't understand what just happened. Obviously, it wasn't my kind of movie but if you go into it expecting a wild, nonsensical LSD trip then go for it, I guess.But beware the horses. I'm scared to sleep",Sorry to Bother You

Oh yeah, did I mention that the Sunday afternoon showing we attended was FULL? And, yes, it was a nice day outside) we were constantly saying to each other ""I have no idea where this is going or how it's going to end."" Serious understatement.
