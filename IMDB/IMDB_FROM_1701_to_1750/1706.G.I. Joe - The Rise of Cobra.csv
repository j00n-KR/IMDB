0,TheLittleSongbird,"Far from a masterpiece, but I enjoyed it for what it was",7,14 June 2011,"GI Joe:Rise of Cobra was better than expected, at least in my view. It is far from a masterpiece, the story is often thin and unfocused, Channing Tatum is bland and painful to watch sometimes and the quality of the script is uneven, there are some smart and witty lines but there are also some really bad howlers as well. That said, I did enjoy it for what it was, and I have seen far worse movies, some of which didn't promise much(Disaster Movie) and some of which did look as though it would be entertaining but it was actually a pile of rubbish(Dungeons & Dragons). The sets, scenery, costumes, cinematography and special effects are wonderful to watch, the music is memorable and suitably bombastic, the action is thrilling, the film is decently paced, the finale is the epitome of the term epic and Dennis Quaid is quite good in his role. Overall, far from perfect but for me not a pile of buffalo dung either. 7/10 Bethany Cox",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
1,bkoganbing,Action Figures Sold Separately,5,27 April 2012,"I'm too old to have played with GI Joes as a child, but I do recall my nephew did so love his action figures as a child. As the credits rolled at the beginning of the film I saw that Hasbro Toys was acknowledged as the creator of GI Joe which was only proper. With the film based on a doll, the creators really had a free hand in making up out of whole cloth a story for the ever combat prepared action figure whom Channing Tatum brings to life. Poor Tatum should have gotten something better for his troubles. He's a soldier who joins an elite unit after a convoy he's assigned to is attacked. The unit is an international fighting force headed by Dennis Quaid who twenty years earlier might have been cast in Tatum's role.The mission of this unit is a serious one. Some meglomaniacal arms dealer is looking to start World War III and he's got a real nasty weapon to do the job. A missile warhead with thousands of Nano-bots who eat metal until the off switch is turned. Drop them on a crowded city and the structures will be a feeding ground.Some ten years earlier in Agent Cody Banks a similar type weapon was what teenage agent Frankie Muniz was fighting. I enjoyed that film better than this.And the seeds of the sequel were planted in this film, a sequel coming out later this year. I'll try and restrain myself.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
2,Leofwine_draca,"Silly, convoluted kid-friendly product",4,8 December 2011,"A disappointingly routine action blockbuster, based like TRANSFORMERS on a line of toys and offering up exactly the same kind of big-bucks-equals-missing-storyline kind of nonsense. I keep watching these movies with the intention to enjoy them, but they're so shallowly plotted – and the characters are so thin – that even printed cartoons have more depth. The nonsensical back story to this film involves some super-weapon that the bad guys use to plan destruction while the good guys have to stop them.The cast is terrible, particularly the walking slab of meat that is Channing Tatum. It says something when the best performance comes from Ray Park (Darth Maul in STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE), an actor who remains suited and masked for the entire duration of the movie. Way too much time is given over to physically handsome but bland and untalented personalities like Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols and the aforementioned Tatum while genuine actors like Jonathan Pryce and Dennis Quaid are left on the sidelines. Of the younger stars, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is miscast in a role that needs a much older and more experienced actor while Lee Byung-hun (A BITTERSWEET LIFE) gets to show off some fancy martial arts and that's about it. The less said about Christopher Eccleston's OTT turn as the bad guy, the better.The one good thing about G. I. JOE is the quality of the special effects work, which is truly excellent (a lengthy and destructive car chase is the highlight in this respect). Every dollar of the mega budget is up on the screen for all to see. Unfortunately, though, director Stephen Sommers shows no respect for cinematic convention such as story development, suspense or character arcs, preferring instead to begin with a massively elaborate action scene and virtually keep it up for the entire running time. The resultant overkill unfortunately saps the film of most of its enjoyment.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
3,SnoopyStyle,"Boys with their toys, and Girls in their skintight outfits",6,28 September 2013,"Highly dangerous metal eating Nanomites could eat and replicate incredibly. Captain Duke Hauser (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are transporting the dangerous Nanomites warheads when they are attacked by Cobra led by Anastasia DeCobray (Sienna Miller). Luckily they're saved by a special force called G. I. Joe. Duke and Ripcord join up with the Joes to battle Cobra.This is simply a blow em up action adventure. A lot of gadgets, and a lot of action mask a lack of acting and storytelling. This movie is a blunt instrument bashing in your brain into submission with loud thumping explosive action sequences. It is boys with theirs toys, and girls in their skintight outfits.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
4,Horst_In_Translation,All in all a decent result,6,29 September 2013,"If you approach this one by expecting a mindless fun time at the movies which you won't have to think about too much, you will not be disappointed. You get what you could expect here. There's no great acting involved by anybody, most of the characters aren't even written to be the basis for a good performance, but it's all about the special effects. And while I wasn't too big on how the desert was designed early on, most of the action afterwards, especially the Paris sequences, is pretty convincing. As were most of the fight sequences, especially those with one guy dressed in white, the other in black.The film is directed by Stephen Sommers from the Mummy movies. It's been a while since I watched those, so I can't really say to which extent his abilities improved or declined by then, but I think ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is a decent overall result which is not without flaws, but very much worth a watch for the entertainment value. What I also liked about it is that pretty much all the supporting characters were written over-the-top in an interesting way, especially the two ladies portrayed by Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols and Marlon Wayans brings some nice comic relief here and there. Unfortunately, as a result, the actual central character of the story, portrayed by Channing Tatum, seemed rather boring. At least, I never really felt the need to cheer him on, even when he was in captivity as his captors were all much more interesting to watch than him. Sure, a good villain makes or breaks the movie, but there should at least be some grit to the hero too. Occasionally the film reminded me story- and looks-wise of the Bond movie ""Die Another Day"", but maybe that was just me.Let me finally add that I'm not familiar with the comics this is based on. I'm merely judging the movie itself with no reference to its origins. In any case, I recommend this film and I see there's a sequel coming out this year. I wouldn't say it's a must-watch by any means, but I'll make sure to catch a copy at some point. Hopefully it's equally entertaining as the last.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
5,claudio_carvalho,For Fans of C.G.I. and Explosions Only,4,2 January 2010,"""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is one of those imbeciles full of action movies like ""Transformers"" where the viewer is forbidden to think and indicated for fans of C.G.I. and explosions only. The screenplay is ridiculous, and as an example, the elite force G.I. Joe destroy half Paris chasing the bad guys that had the intention of destroying the Eiffel Tower only that is not spared in the end; or destroying a large area in the polar ice cap to defeat the villain, reflecting the doctrine of ""destroying the environment to save the world from the terrorists"". The lines are silly, like for example Ana saying ""nice shoes"" while shooting and destroying a building. James McCullen is wealthy and powerful, and his motivations are never clear. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""G.I. Joe: A Origem de Cobra"" (""G.I. Joe: The Origin of Cobra"")",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
6,kosmasp,Summer Blockbuster,8,27 September 2009,"This movie was everything ""Transformers 2"" tried to be and should have been. I am not an avid GI Joe fan or anything (don't have any toys or whatnot), but the movie really had me going. Of course it is a blockbuster and you can't compare it with movies that have an actual plot or are character driven pieces. This is just a fun little movie, that is just that.The jokes hit (almost) every time and we get some relaxing time, between action sequences. The action doesn't disappoint, the actors are chosen carefully (even if Dennis Quais doesn't really do that much) and the story just serves the movie (as an Origin story). Mindless, but good relaxing fun, that you can have, if you want to.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
7,jboothmillard,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,7,1 March 2012,"I knew G.I. Joe as an American action figure, and in Britain we have our own version called Action Man, but I didn't realise the franchise included other characters in a group or anything, but I was keen even before finding that out to see the film, from director Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Van Helsing). Basically arms manufacturing company M.A.R.S. (Military Armaments Research Syndicate) have created a new array of warheads, and a special technological weapon, and Kazakhstan stationed soldiers Conrad S. 'Duke' Hauser (Dear John's Channing Tatum) and Wallace A. 'Ripcord' Weems(Scary Movie's Marlon Wayans) are ordered to transport the cargo. The mission however is attacked by a group of thieves, led by Anastasia 'The Baroness' DeCobray (Sienna Miller), who Duke recognises as his ex-fiancée, and they are working for the evil organisation Cobra. During the ambush though they were also saved by top secret international special forces unit G.I. Joe, led by General Clayton M. 'Hawk' Abernathy (Dennis Quaid), who are on the trail of these thieves and Cobra, and the two soldiers join the group after Duke reveals knowing The Baroness. While Duke and Ripcord train to be part of G.I. Joe, Cobra member Laird James 'Destro' McCullen XXIV (Christopher Eccleston) wants to recapture the most dangerous and devastating weapon, the metal eating ""nanomite"" warhead, to cause destruction in parts of the world. Soon enough the Joes: Duke, Ripcord, Shana M. 'Scarlett' O'Hara (Rachel Nichols), Hershel 'Heavy Duty' Dalton (Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Snake Eyes (Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace's Ray Park) and the rest are ready to prove themselves true American heroes and save the day. Unfortunately one of the warheads during a heated attack does get launched into the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, and the metal melts so quickly that a part of the city is destroyed with no way to stop it. The big twist comes when the true villain of the piece, and the mastermind behind Cobra, The Doctor is thought to be dead brother of Ana, Rex Lewis (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who has been disfigured from getting caught in a bombing that involved the nanomite warheads. In the end, Cobra and all members of it are defeated, The Baroness is taken into custody with nanomites that need to be removed from her body, Duke and the Joes are praised for saving the day, and villain Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) has used nanomites to assume the identity of the U.S. President (Jonathan Pryce). Also starring Byung-Hun Lee Thomas S. 'Storm Shadow' Arashikage, Saïd Taghmaoui as Abel 'Breaker' Shaz, Kevin J. O'Connor as Dr. Mindbender, Karolína Kurková as Courtney A. 'Cover Girl' Kreiger and Brendan Fraser as Sgt. Geoffrey Stone IV. The cast are very well chosen, Tatum making a good dedicated soldier and main man, Miller being a good double crossing bad girl, and the supporting cast members are great too, especially Wayans who gets most of the one liners. The story is fairly straight forward, the dialogue is what you would expect in this kind of film, and there is good use of flashbacks to see the origins of the individual characters, it is definitely the explosive destruction, fights and chases that catch your eye and keep you watching, it is an enjoyable action adventure. Very good!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
8,Tweekums,At least it was better than Transformers 2,4,12 April 2010,"When I sat down to watch this I was expecting it to be terrible but while it was rubbish it wasn't as dire as I'd expected and at just under two hours long it didn't overstay its welcome like the latest ""Transformers"" film. Set in the near future the army have been asked to transfer a case of warheads from the makers to NATO. Each warhead contains nonobots that will eat their target and continue eating until they are deactivated. The convoy is attacked and just as it looks like the weapons are lost another force turns up and saves the day. It emerges that this new force is GI Joe, an international military organisation. Duke and ""Ripcord"", the two army survivors ask to join and after a trail are accepted. They haven't been there long though when the base is attacked and the weapons are stolen by a force led by Duke's ex-wife. What follows is a chase to retrieve the weapons, first in Paris then at the bad guys lair under the North Pole.Fans of non stop CGI action will love this film as it is almost constant; there are a variety of CGI planes and submarines, lots of things blowing up an a car chase through Paris which ends in the destruction of the city's most famous landmark. I was a little disturbed at the total lack of concern for all the Parisians who must have been killed in the chase, we didn't even get a comment from the good guys about trying to avoid casualties. It was though it didn't matter because it looked cool. The acting wasn't great and I was surprised to find the usually good Christopher Eccleston hamming it up as the leader of the bad guys. While the two sides were rather unrealistically balanced; both included a good looking woman and both included katana wielding ninjas but this can be forgiven in what was never meant to be more than a silly action flick. While the film was pretty rubbish if you just want to sit down for a couple of hours of relatively bloodless action you could do a lot worse.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
9,BA_Harrison,"For a film based on a toy, it's very entertaining.",8,30 March 2014,"Army buddies Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) team up with an elite international fighting force to try and recover four high-tech warheads stolen by an evil organisation led by arms dealer McCullen (Christopher Eccleston).For those who don't know, G.I. Joe is a popular range of American action figure toys made by Hasbro. Like the Transformers movies, which are also based on a Hasbro line, this movie is clearly designed to help their toys fly off the shelves; but where I found Michael Bay's giant robot movies to be almost unwatchable (thanks to crap direction, lousy editing, an often over-serious tone and Shia LaBeouf), Rise of the Cobra proved to be surprisingly good fun.Directed by Stephen Sommers, the man who gave us the mega-successful Mummy series, the film is undeniably brainless, but thanks to a great cast (which also includes Dennis Quaid, Ray 'Darth Maul' Park, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Korean star Byung-hun Lee), superb production design, countless expertly staged set-pieces, and a stunning array of special effects, boredom was not an option. Besides, how could I get tired of any film that features both Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols in such incredibly tight-fitting outfits? 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",G.I.

10,paul_haakonsen,No no no Joe!,6,16 February 2010,"Having grown up with G.I. Joe cartoons on TV, I just had to see this movie. And I must say that I am left with mixed feelings.First of all, this is a splendid action movie with lots of cool stuff going on. Lots of shooting, martial arts, explosions and all that makes for a good action movie.However, there is very little G.I. Joe feel to the movie. Sure they have the same names as the ones in the cartoons (and comic books), sure they have the gadgets, but something is missing. That whole ""real American hero"" feel is lacking from this movie. And that is what drags this movie down.The cast is good, lots of good performances here. But at times the dialogue is halting, coming off a cheesy or clumsy.Watch it for what it is; a good action movie. Forget that you have seen the G.I. Joe cartoons (or read the comic books). With that out of your head you will be thoroughly entertained by the movie. If you go into this movie with G.I. Joe in your heart, you are in for somewhat of a disappointment.I give my rating based on the action movie aspect of the movie, having decided to overlook its lack of the true spirit of G.I. Joe.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
11,Quinoa1984,Knowing is half the battle... the other half is not going to this movie if you know any better,3,8 August 2009,"GI Joe: The Rise of the Cobra is product in the guise of commercial art. Matter of fact, this would make a very good example to show in a class about film-making as a means of a purely commercial end. Everything about it really excludes a satisfying artistic intent or with something to actually say. This is, in fact, the anti Iron Man; where that movie provided us with a solid story and smart script and characters to care about and real skill with the actors to apply to a 'popcorn' movie, 'GI Joe' is everything against that.It's one of those ridiculous military-industrial-complex machine-stories involving a cold one-dimensional villain (Christopher Eccleston) out to get warheads that are more like bacteria-heads and the elite group of would-be robot soldier humans (i.e. Tatum, Wayans) who are up against them. Oh, and there's a story too! And characters with backstories too and, uh, stuff. But by the end of it, I couldn't really remember or care about any of the characters, even Sienna Miller's Baroness who is attempted to be given a character. It's ultimately... dumb. Dumb as a doornail, and in its plastic-form and execution, proud of it. It's another step for Stephen Sommers away from fun-stupid stuff like the Mummy movies and into, well, Van Helsing territory once more.Anybody who sincerely likes and enjoys this movie without irony or unintentional hilarity is either deluded or the real-life Beavis & Butt-head. This is just a retarded toy of movie-making, the kind of thing those who are young will look back on like the Nostalgia Critic does with say Barb Wire in befuddled astonishment. It's one stupid scene of dialog, one stupid set-piece after another. I'm not even sure why the hell I went and saw this silly machinery; maybe I thought I'd get another Ghost Rider experience, where it's so stupid it ventures into a kind of unbridled brilliance. But this is not the case. Sure, there's some really funny bits and moments, and an action scene or two that had me howling laughing (or trying to control it). It may not always be mean about itself, but to say it takes itself a wee bit too seriously at times is an understatement, even with all of those one-liners thrown to Marlon Wayans. Yeesh.Ultimately, there is no real significant plot, though the film does try, and there is no real significant conflict because whatever they try to set up is clichéd to the point of inertia. One other thing that astounded me was the supporting performance from Joseph Gordon Levitt. I was under the impression he was in *good* movies since his kid-movie days ended. This is a turn for the inexplicable as he plays The Doctor, barely recognizable for most of the time in a sound fx voice and make-up and half-face mask and is just mind-bogglingly hammy, and not really in a good way. Not to mention really crap-tacular CGI (all of it, really, save for the Eiffel tower collapse which is oddly mundane), Celtic commands being excused for Scottish (isn't Celtic Irish?), and the kind of mind-numbing 'flashbacks' meant to emphasize the characters that are horribly cheesy and bad and Kung-fu parodies and ... wow.Pardon me for saying this, as I mean no disrespect to the mentally challenged, but... this is retarded blockbuster movie-sex. Period. It's not harmful like Michael Bay's Transformer movies, but it's pretty close to being that bad of an un-ironic recruiter for the US military in a fantasy world. And don't say that it might be just good for the kids and that's who it's aimed at. Bulls***. Kids deserve better. That's like saying McDonald's is good for kids. It's something easy to take them to, without much effort and spoon-fed by TV commercials, but it's not *good* for kids. Matter of fact this is wretchedly violent stuff, too, marked only from an R for a lack of constant blood-pouring. At best it's sometimes joyfully dumb, like a big dog who keeps drooling all over the carpet but tries to charm with chasing its tail. At worst, it features a cast of supposedly talented actors like Quaid and Eccleston and Levitt and Pryce and eye-candy like Sienna Miller and places them in a rotten and contrived and moronic script and lackluster action direction. Did I mention the flashbacks?",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
12,wes-connors,Joe Against The Joes,5,28 January 2012,"Sometime in the near future, muscular ""G.I.

Also cool are ""nanomites"" that boil in the necks of enslaved men. Helping Mr. Tatum is muscular sidekick Marlon Wayans (as Wallace ""Rip"" Weems). Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Rex ""The Doctor"" Lewis) goes from good to bad-ass.

13,sunwarrior13,It Has Enough To Keep The Viewer Entertained,8,8 April 2013,"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is a science fiction action film based on the G.I. Joe toy franchise, with particular inspiration from the comic book and cartoon series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero.It features an ensemble cast that includes Channing Tatum,Christopher Eccleston,Joseph Gordon-Levitt,Lee Byung-hun,Sienna Miller,Rachel Nichols,Ray Park,Jonathan Pryce, Said Taghmaoui,Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje,Marlon Wayans and Dennis Quaid. The story follows two American soldiers, Duke and Ripcord, who join the G.I. Joe Team after being attacked by MARS troops.It is directed by Stephen Sommers, produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura and co-written by Stuart Beattie, based on the screenplay by John Paul Kay. Weapons master James McCullen has created a nanotech-based weapon capable of destroying a city. His company M.A.R.S. (Military Armament Research Syndicate) sells four warheads to NATO, and NATO troops led by American soldiers Duke and Ripcord are tasked with delivering the warheads. Their convoy is ambushed by the Baroness, whom Duke recognizes to be his ex-fiancée Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett ,Snake Eyes, Breaker and Heavy Duty. They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe's command center in Egypt, and upon arriving rendezvous with the head of the G.I. Joe Team, General Hawk. Hawk takes command of the warheads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to let them join his group, after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness. McCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor, planning on using the warheads to cause panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends Storm Shadow and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads, with assistance from Zartan.Overall,it is largely a cartoonish, over-the-top action fest propelled by silly writing, inconsistent visual effects, and merely passable performances.After a first hour that plays like a bad TV show,the movie hits it groove with an over-the-top Paris chase sequence that, in turn, leads to an underwater finale that's absurdly overproduced, momentarily diverting, and then instantly forgettable.It's just as you would expect from an action film: passably acted, conventionally written and occasionally fun.",G.I.

14,hitchcockthelegend,It feels like it was made for pre-teens by pre-teens.,3,14 July 2012,"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is directed by Stephen Sommers who also co writes the story and screenplay with four other people. It stars Dennis Quaid, Channing Tatum, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Marlon Wayans, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Rachel Nichols, Sienna Miller, Christopher Eccleston, Saïd Taghmaoui, Lee Byung-hun, Ray Park, Jonathan Pryce, Arnold Vosloo and Karolina Kurkova. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Mitchell Amundsen.It's all very well people coming forward and proclaiming that it is what it is, it was never going to be an intelligent film, it does what it says on the tin etc, but there has to still be a marker for the worth of a popcorn action movie. Put G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra up against something like Transformers, or Sommers' own The Mummy, and you get what G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is, an awful empty movie that uses crash bang and wallop to try and hide its short comings. Sure it has visceral thrills, it has to have those since the dialogue is so crummy, so crummy in fact it gives the terrible acting a run for its money as worst part of the film. It's near heartbreaking for a film fan to see actors like Dennis Quaid, Sienna Miller, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jonathan Pryce really scraping the bottom of the barrel. You gotta hand it to Sommers for his cheek, he only lets the film breath for about ten seconds at a time before moving things quickly on in the hope nobody notices. And we are of course expected to piece together the plot in those ten second snippets. The action is mounted like a child mounts a battle with his toy soldiers on the bedroom floor, while the computer effects are often shoddy and awash in a whirl of quick cuts, flash edits and spinning cameras. I felt like I had been on a Waltzer ride at the fairground, after ten minutes I felt sick, disorientated and wanted to get off quickly.Loud, dumb and fun is the general tag-line often applied to big effects strewn action blockbusters, trouble is is that the last part isn't true here at all. 3/10 for Silvestri's score, Miller's shapely form in a cat-suit and some nice colour photography by Amundsen.",G.I.

15,Theo Robertson,Almost A Fairly Good Summer Blockbuster,6,30 March 2013,"I probably wouldn't have watched this if it didn't have Christopher Eccleston as the villain . Eccleston is an actor I've always been impressed with and having seen an episode of DOCTOR WHO tonight where the prattling jackanapes that is Matt Smith certainly made me appreciate the much missed talents of Eccleston in the role The film does get off to a great start as a Scottish arms dealer McCullen finds himself in a French torture chamber in the 17th Century . A terrible fate awaits him as he is tied down and a red hot metal mask is put over his face. This is a genuinely shocking scene full of latent sadism that gives the impression that it's running a very thin line between the 12 and 15 certificate . The film does deserve some credit for being an enjoyably mean spirited blockbuster . Minor characters occasionally get killed off in a cruel manner which is unexpected Where the film fails is that it's very noisy and trying too hard to impress and sinks slightly in a welter of explosions chases and battles . One had wished the film had been given more room to breath and the characters had been explored a bit more but that said it's not really a film where you expect character development because characters are wafer thin cyphers who only exist to fight one another . One also can't help noticing that despite having a physical presence Eccleston's Scottish accent is both laughable and distracting in equal measure , but again it's not a film where you're expecting Oscar winning performances",G.I.

16,preppy-3,"The kind of movie where you sit back, turn off your mind and watch things go BOOM!!!!",6,15 August 2009,"Silly movie. Something about an elite force called G.I. Joe who is assigned to protect America from terrorists. Some of those people have captured four nuclear warheads and plan to use them against the world (for no really good reason). Duke (Channing Tatum) and his annoying best buddy (Marlon Wayans) join the group to fight the terrorists because Duke's ex-girlfriend (Sienna Miller) is one of the heads of the group. Really! The plot is ridiculous. If you think about it it makes to no sense--characters change allegiance at the drop of a hat; the plot ""twists"" are so obvious they're almost insulting; dialogue so inane that it would embarrass writers of an Archie comic book and there are some REAL stupid situations here (my eyes hurt from rolling them so much). Also it's LOUD--a young kid in front of me complained to his dad it was too loud 10 minutes in! As for the acting--the Hasbro action figures this movie is based on show more animation than the actors! What can you say about a movie where Wayans gives the best performance? Heck--even Dennis Quaid was bad! Channing Tatum (as Duke) was tall, handsome, pumped up and is one of the WORST actors I have ever seen! Only Miller gives a halfway decent performance (despite the fact that her character inexplicably changes towards the end). There's also plenty of room left for a sequel (which I heard is already in the works). Also TONS of violence with people being killed--but no blood so we can get the PG-13 rating.Despite all these things I'd be lying if I said I hated it. The special effects were excellent, there were plenty of action sequences and they were FULL of excitement, the stupid plot kept me amused and I was honestly never bored. This is not a good movie at all (the company refused to screen it to critics before it opened because they were positive it would get bad reviews--which it did) but it WAS entertaining and amusing in a no-think kind of way.

Joe toy action figure, comics & subsequent cartoon series, first released in 1964 to try & come up with a toy that would be as popular for boys as Barbie was for girls G.I. Joe was a big success & I guess someone decided to make a film out of the franchise & decided to hire Sommers to direct it. I am not entirely sure either idea was a particularly good one but I suppose G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is undemanding enough, loud enough, dumb enough & spectacular enough to appeal on very basic levels. It came as no great surprise to discover that G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not screened for the press & critics before it's release, always a bad sign. The script isn't very good, the plot is basic & tries to shoehorn in lots of G.I. Joe continuity, character's & the like but never having watched the cartoon series, brought any of the toys or read the comic it all went over my head really. The plot is a little loose, I don't really understand why McCullen needs to steal his own warheads, I don't really understand what they intend to do with them or for what reasons as if they destroy the world there won't be a world left to rule, if you know what I mean. At least it moves along like a rocket & it never lets you get bored even if by the end you are a bit desensitised. The script & production delights in showing off hi-tech military gadgets & weapons from armoured suits to submarines to underwater bases to fighter jets to laser rifles. I must admit that I didn't like the central concept of the film, the basic idea that you should fight violence with violence, the idea that you need to kill people & blow things up in such a casual way is not a positive message. The makers logic here is to make things blow-up, crash & have people kill each other as coolly & loudly as possible, the idea doesn't sit well with me especially in a film obviously aged at a young audience. There is a sort of James Bond feel with the hidden base, gadgets, the evil organisation & daft plot to take over the world but G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra has none of Bond's class I'm afraid. The character's aren't the best & aren't helped by some poor one-liners, most of the Joe's & Cobra's have some history with each other shown in various flashbacks, Duke comes across as a dull hero while Ripcord is highly annoying as the comic relief black sidekick (thank God he has been dropped from the sequel).One positive aspect of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is that Sommers directs & edits the action in a clear & understandable way, sure it's over the top, totally impossible & far too noisy but at least there's no fast editing where you can't tell what's going on & praise the lord he keeps his camera nice & steady so there's no horrible hand-held shaky cam crap present. The CGI computer effects are generally pretty good, the action scenes themselves are alright but apart from the amazing car chase & destruction of the Eiffel Tower in Paris it's a bit repetitive & not that exciting although there are still plenty of explosions, fights, shoot-outs & jet-pack flying ninjas in white suits. There lots of futuristic weapons & vehicles on show here of all shapes & sizes & they look cool enough they don't really do much & I ended up feeling like I was watching some video game as lots of computer graphics explode.With a supposed budget of about $175,000,000 no expense was spared, filmed in California, Prague & the Artic. The acting is bland, Channing Tatum was a terrible choice for the lead, Marlon Wayans is both awful & annoying as the comic sidekick, Rachel Nichols is poor & it's no surprise she has been dumped from the sequel while Eccleston is totally wasted as is Dennis Quaid, Jonathan Pryce & it's left to Sienna Miller in tight rubber to try & save the film. She doesn't, although I admit she does look good in black skin tight rubber.G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is a big, loud, dumb two hour CGI computer effects loaded teen action film based on some toys, it's watchable for one or two impressive effects & action scenes & Sienna Miller in tight rubber but otherwise it's fairly forgettable. Followed by G.I Joe: Retaliation (2012) which doesn't feature Marlon Wayans, it's looking better already.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
19,dbborroughs,The action set pieces are the draw. The plot is as mindless and empty as they come,6,8 August 2009,"Mindless action filled shoot'em up based upon the toy and cartoon series that depicts the battle between a super secret organization working for good and the mad plotting of a crazy weapons dealer and his shadowy evil organization (it eventually becomes COBRA).Better than it has any right to be the film is engaging thanks to the not wholly serious attitude and several truly amazing action set pieces (including the amazing chase through Paris). Truthfully the film is little more than the mad musings of a bunch of kids playing with there toys but some how it works.I could go into the numerous flaws in the film from the lack of real believability (how many plot holes are there?); to the numerous flashbacks that are suppose to build character and back story but are in fact laughably awful; to any number of other problems, but to go into them would be pointless because the film kind of over comes them and you continue to watch in spite of yourself. This is a real turn your mind off sort of a film.If you like great action, minimal plot and don't want to think I suggest you give the film a try. If you want anything else stay as afar away as possible.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
20,zardoz-13,Hyper-Kinetic Hasbro Heroics,8,7 August 2009,"""Van Helsing"" director Stephen Sommers pays tribute to several Hollywood blockbusters in his latest effort ""G.I. Joe, The Rise of the Cobra,"" the second-live action film celebrating the legendary line of Hasbro action figures. Sommers makes allusions in ""G.I. Joe"" to the James Bond epics ""Moonraker,"" ""Thunderball,"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" as well as the Clint Eastwood Cold War thriller ""Firefox"" and Jean-Claude Van Damme sci-fi flick ""Universal Soldier. ""G.I. Joe"" bristles with larger-than-life heroes and villains clashing with super-charged weapons amid futuristic pyrotechnics. Not surprisingly, characterization takes a backseat to the high-octane, adrenalin-laced action sequences. Sadly, the formulaic storyline doesn't spring as many surprises as most big action films, but Sommers keeps the action moving swiftly.A treacherous Scottish arms dealer named James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston of ""Dr. Who""), who is in league with a vast criminal organization called COBRA, has spent ten years creating a apocalyptic new weapon with NATO funding. McCullen's Mars Weapons Company have subverted microscopic green nanomites originally used to eliminate cancer into feisty little buggers can munch their way through either the armor on an army tank or the Eiffel Tower. McCullen presents this formidable weapon to NATO, and our two heroes, U.S. Army officers Duke (Channing Tatum of ""Public Enemies"") and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans of ""Dance Movie""), escort it via a heavily armed convoy with Apache helicopters flying overhead as escorts. Out of nowhere the military escort is ambushed. A stealthy ninja in white, Storm Shadow (South Korean superstar Byung-hun Lee), and a spectacularly sexy kick-butt babe-in-black, the Baroness (Sienna Miller of ""Factory Girl""), try to steal the suitcase containing the four warheads with the deadly nano technology. Duke recognizes the Baroness as a girl that he almost married. Fortunately, our heroes manage to hang onto the warheads because the elite G.I. Joe commando team intervenes and thwarts the villains. A black-clad ninja, Snake Eyes (Ray Park of ""Fanboys""), crosses swords with Shadow Storm. As we learn afterwards, these guys have a history of hate. Later, the villains manage to reprogram a homing device in the suitcase and the Baroness and her team invades the G.I. Joe headquarters—called the Pit--deep beneath the desert sands of the Sahara in Egypt. They catch the heroes off guard, wound General Hawk, and steal the warheads.McCullen has teamed up with a malevolent scientific genius, the Doctor (Joseph Gordon-Levitt of ""The Look Out""), who injects this nano serum into soldiers. We see one soldier thrust his arm into a glass case housing a venomous cobra and the snake bites him. The soldier withdraws his arm and the nano technology in his bloodstream repels the venom. You see it leak out of his wounds. We're talking some bad mothers here! McCullen wants to demonstrate to the world how lethal his cannibalistic nano technology is and dispatches his minions to Paris to destroy the Eiffel Tower. Meanwhile, Duke and Ripcord convince General Hawk (Dennis Quaid of ""Vantage Point"") to let them join the team in exchange for Duke's information about the Baroness. Duke had planned to marry her, but things got complicated when he made a promise to look after her brother during a raid in Africa. Our heroes pass all the grueling trials, including some devised by a combat instructor (Brendan Fraser of the ""Mummy"" movies in a cameo). Duke and Ripcord don a couple of accelerator outfits, created by the Stan Winston Studio, which enable them to hoof it around Paris at 40 miles per hour, dodge missiles streaking toward them, and hurtle cars like daredevils, as they pursue the Baroness and Shadow Storm. This qualifies as the best action scene in ""G.I. Joe."" At 118 minutes, ""G.I. Joe"" rarely sacrifices its momentum, except to plunge us into frequent flashbacks so we can learn important events that shaped the lives of the heroes and the villains. The Stuart Beattie, David Elliot and Paul Lovett screenplay isn't for an instant remotely believable, but the action is pretty exciting. Unfortunately, predictability sets in early, enough so that a couple of revelations lack sufficient punch. Furthermore, Sommers and his scribes shun any effort to create characters here because that would interfere with the hyper-kinetic action sequences.Sommers directs with a sure hand, but the humor that made his previous movies so charming is conspicuously absent. The chief villain mimics the James Bond villain Drax from ""Moonraker"" (1979) because he steals his own weapons back from the military. Later, Ripcord pilots a state-of-the-art ""Firefox"" jet with a sophisticated weapons system that responds to vocal commands instead of hands-on application. He has to chase two deadly missiles before each destroys major world capitals, another cliffhanger ""Moonraker"" ploy, and blast them to smithereens. The massive polar ice cap base that the COBRA organization has built recalls another Bond bonanza ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" Kevin J. O'Connor and Arnold Vosloo are two other ""Mummy"" cast members who show up here, and Vosloo gets to impersonate the President. The nanomites recall the scarabs that swarmed throughout ""The Mummy."" People who loved the ""G.I. Joe"" cartoon show might be in a better, more informed position to criticize this actioneer. However, it should be known that Ripcord wasn't an African-American in the cartoon but the villains did launch an assault on the Eiffel Tower. The performances here are serviceable. Channing Tatum seems rather leaden, but then most action heroes are one-dimensional. Our heroes aren't as flamboyant as the villains. Christopher Eccleston chews the scenery with considerable relish like his nanomites and makes a fantastic villain, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes the most of his evil doctor. Although it isn't as audacious as ""Transformers 2,"" ""G.I. Joe"" ranks as an above-average testosterone thriller, with an ending that leaves the film open to an inevitable sequel.",G.I.

21,grantss,So bad you'd think it was directed by Michael Bay or Uwe Boll,2,10 April 2016,"Very very bad, so bad you'd think it was directed by Michael Bay. Lame, predictable, hole-ridden script. Join-the-dots direction. Obviously the CGI is great, but that is a given for a modern action movie.I can't think of crappier movie which contained such a galaxy of stars: Dennis Quaid, Christopher Eccleston, Sienna Miller, Channing Tatum, Rachel Nichols, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marlon Wayans, Jonathan Pryce. Due to the lame plot and direction, none of them are required to extend themselves. In fact, in keeping with the low standard of the movie, it appears that those of them that actually have some acting talent (Dennis Quaid, Christopher Eccleston, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) were told to dumb their performances down. They can do better.Yet another example of the ""don't worry about originality, plot, direction, or acting, CGI is everything"" trend in Hollywood.

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Sloppy Joe, half-baked and jam-packed with flavor imitation(they're quite weak, regardless of if they look it or not)",5,26 August 2009,"Whether or not that's what you ordered, that's what you're getting. Now, you can try to chow down, and hope for the best, or you can leave the establishment angry and unfed. I chose to stay and give the meal a chance, stopping to silently and discretely pick out the large and ungainly bits of corn scattered about it, as I found them tough to swallow. Before I proceed, I feel it only due to inform you that I have had zero personal experience with this franchise before... I knew of its existence(for a couple of years now), and that was about it. On that note, this really doesn't do as much as it could to help newcomers find out that much about who's who and so forth. I say the following without any hyperbole: It should be clear within the first few seconds of this(!) that every single fraction of actual sense was, long before pre-production began, thrown violently out the window(to avoid a gaping cavity remaining in the script, it was subsequently filled with every single cliché and stereotype imaginable), blew up mid-air, and then probably again, in another giant fireball, upon landing(unless it just kept plummeting, exploding every so often along the way). Oh, don't worry if any good guys were near it, they seem pretty immune to that sort of thing. It has all the impact of a big sneeze on them, which, incidentally, is a stronger response(and that's the main reason I wasn't overwhelmed by the copious amounts of it) than you're likely to have at the majority of the constant action in this. Honestly, it's essentially non-stop, throughout this. And hey, some of it genuinely is cool, and one or two things are downright creative and different. I'm not going to lie to you... portions of this did entertain me. The music is great, and always fits, which is sadly not always guaranteed today in brainless popcorn flicks. A lot of scenes are of no consequence to the reasonable plot. The story-telling is unimpressive, and the exposition is put forth with all the subtlety of a hammer to the face. I laughed quite a bit while watching this, though always at stuff that was unintentionally hilarious. The actual jokes and gags were stupid, with delivery that ought to have generations of comedians who appeared on, and mastered, the medium of film, rolling in their graves, eventually reaching such velocity that they'd burst out through the bottom of their coffin and be headed speedily towards Earth's core. The writing of this contains such massive, deep, glaring and obvious holes... I think it's apt to compare it to a Limburger in its prime, after it's been rampaged by a trigger-happy platoon armed entirely with weapons that are simultaneously fully automatic and rather accurate: If you do manage to steer clear of the chasms, you'll still find yourself headed directly towards ripe, odorous cheese. If that's what'd you'd like in your dinner, have at it. I could count the aspects of this that could be cut out without it affecting the whole in the least. It's worse still if you'd prefer a list of the occurrences in this that have no grounding in anything even vaguely resembling reality. Nepotism that'd make J.J. cry ""uncle"". About that, why'd they hire the *one* chick that was on Alias, whose bad-assery *didn't* extend to every moment she was on-screen? There is no emotion or drama herein. It's not impossible to find yourself at least somewhat enjoying this and that(it is, here as in many other cases, vital to distinguish between that and what's technically actually of high quality, because one doesn't always equal the other, and remember, they are not mutually exclusive) and it's certainly considerably less painful to sit through than every single other Sommers... piece, let's call it that, and I'm not saying of what, that I've seen. Van Helsing and Deep Rising, for those wondering. With that said, I have as little respect for the man as I did before. Talent? Where? There's a bunch of it wasted, here. The effects look nice, and sound doesn't irritate, and tends to be well-done. Acting consists solely of performances that are uninspired or overdone, to the point where they're silly. Most of the cast isn't particularly talented, though they've done better than this. This does have a twist I didn't see coming. Not every concept in this is hopeless and stupid. The martial arts is awesome, Park gets to do his thing, if all too infrequently, in this. While I, of course, don't know for sure, I can imagine that purists are going to hate this. When something is translated from one form of expression to another, it almost invariably has to undergo changes. ""Perfect adaptation"" is usually something of an oxymoron. With that said, I do sympathize when it it carelessly treated, and thus ruined, and I can believe that that's one of the many things of a negative nature that occurred here, as it often does when Hollywood is doing the ""translation"". In at least one way, this does seem as if it took a hint from the Saturday morning cartoon show; it definitely feels like one long toy commercial(not to mention that this does feel like it's the result of kids sitting down with figures and playing with them). To return to my running analogy, allow me to called this something of a junk food; the taste will be gone before you're done chewing, it won't add anything remotely positive to your system, and you will soon be hungry again(...that last one may relate to Chinese). Perhaps fans of Stephen will love it, since it is similar to his other works. I recommend this to that group, and to those wanting absolutely nothing other than mindless B-level schlock to pass two hours. Anyone else, well, I really am not exaggerating in what I write in this review. Now you know. And knowing is half the battle. 5/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
24,neil-476,Crash bang wallop. For two hours.,6,26 August 2009,"I do hope no-one going to see this movie is doing so in order to see top-of-the-range acting because, quite frankly, it's not that sort of movie. As anyone who has seen the first two Mummy movies or Van Helsing will know, Stephen Sommers offers us action dressed up in eye candy, and GI Joe is not an exception to that rule.In fact, it reinforces it, because I don't ever recall seeing a movie with so much action. This film never stops, not even for plot. Yes, there is a plot: it's daft, mind you (why are Cobra doing this, for crying out loud? I mean, these people have the wherewithal to build a huge city packed with electronics and cutting edge ordnance - underwater, at the North Pole, for heaven's sake!) and there is even some character motivation and backstory, but none of this serves to hold up the breakneck pace - one might use the word relentless - for a second.That's the main problem. Yes, it's mindless popcorn hokum, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But you come out of it exhausted, having had no opportunity to draw breath in between explosions, underwater dogfights, explosions, hand-to-hand combat, explosions, hugely destructive chase sequences, explosions, car crashes, explosions, destruction by nanomites, explosions, missile chases, and explosions. Oh, and maybe I forgot to mention the explosions.Cast-wise, Dennis Quaid does Dennis Quaid, Christopher Eccleston takes the paycheque, Channing Tatum is glum as hero Duke, and Sienna Miller is gloriously slinky in black leather (plus she seems to have acquired some serious cleavage from somewhere, although mine is not to speculate on the source) Only Arnold Vosloo and Marlon Wayans remember to have fun, so thanks to them.And now you'll have to excuse me, I'm so knackered from watching this movie that I'm going to have to go and have a lie down.",G.I.

It's been a while since I've seen such a collection of hot chicks toting guns gathered in one place, and for that, if for no other reason, ""G.I.

Joe: The Rise of the Cobra (2009): Dir: Stephen Sommers / Cast: Channing Tatum, Marlon Wayans, Sienna Miller, Dennis Quaid, Rachel Nichols: Here is the latest attempt to bring a vintage cartoon to the screen and this one pretty much proves that salaries should be cut when it comes to crap such as this. The theme of this junk has always been about teamwork although the screenplay collaboration seems spliced together by kids. The Joe squad assemble and do battle against the Cobra Commander and his army. This all amounts to a lot of action, violence and superb special effects much expected in a Stephen Sommers film. Sommers is the one responsible for those flimsy Mummy films, and this is no improvement. The cast sleepwalk through the film with an ensemble that includes Channing Tatum, Marlon Wayans, Sienna Miller, and Dennis Quaid. Could any of them have possibly seen this as a good career move? Most of them are interchangeable with characters that only hardcore collectors of the action figures will grasp. Watching a group of fraternity guys run around the woods with paint ball guns seems more entertaining this five minutes of this tripe. One wonders if this classic comic book could possibly be filmed effectively. It is more or less an excuse for another moron action film as oppose to a celebration of characters that would likely blow this film up. Score: 2 / 10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

McCullen is secretly working for Cobra and plotting to recapture his metal-eating ""Nanomite"" warheads. Duke, Ripcord, and the rest of the unit must stop the launch of these warheads before Cobra uses them to take over the world.........Firstly, anyone expecting anything more than an effects laden action movie with two dimensional characters and a wonderfully over the top plot that makes barely any sense should look elsewhere, this is a big budget film based on a toy franchise.But unlike the dreadful Transformers films, at least the action scenes are coherent, and some of the characters you can warm to ever so slightly.But for the most part of the film, it's the good guys playing it straight, with Marlon Wayans playing the annoying comic relief, and Quaid as the couldn't care less General, and the bad guys turning it up to eleven in the scene chewing stakes.Eccleston really hams it up in a Richard E Grant in Hudson Hawk style, but my word, Levitt is seriously miscast as the Nazi-esque Doctor.But it's a lot of stupid fun, and it's what you'd expect from a Stephen Sommers film. This lies somewhere between The Mummy and Van Helsing for entertainment. The action sequence in Paris is well edited and fun, and the final attack on the villains lair is over the top bilge, but you can't help but enjoy it.So all in all, it's rubbish, but for an over the top action film about toys, you could do a lot worse......",G.I.

28,zetes,It is as bad as everyone assumed it would be,4,9 August 2009,"I have to admit I've been curious about this film since I learned Joseph Gordon-Levitt, my favorite current actor, was cast as the villain of the 1980s cartoon series. I kind of expected it to be not very good, but there has been a small amount of buzz coming out since the day it premiered, mostly saying things like, ""It's not as bad as you'd think,"" but some actually declaring it to be a decent big, dumb, fun action flick. And, let's face it, this summer has left us hurting for that type of movie. Unfortunately, G.I. Joe doesn't fit the bill, at least for me. I'd place the fault mostly with the acting. Like so many of these kinds of action flicks (it is pretty much a superhero movie), the good guys are extremely boring compared to the bad guys. This one is especially bad in that respect. Not only are they boring, a couple of the good guys I straight up wanted to die. Channing Tatum is the lead, and he's God awful. Calling him a block of wood would be insulting to formerly living organisms. If I had known Marlon Wayans was in the picture, I may have at least waited for video. As always, he's only here to provide painful comic relief. Dennis Quaid can be a welcome addition to some movies, but very often he's there just to cash a check, and is really bad. This is one of those times. The only Joe who's even worth having on screen is Rachel Nichols as Scarlett, probably just because of the awesome red hair (dye job, of course). She's cute, and isn't a completely crappy actress. All of the villains are fairly interesting. Byung-hun Lee has a good presence as Storm Shadow, far more than his Joe counterpart, pouty-lipped Snake Eyes (played by the always mute Ray ""Darth Maul"" Park). Sienna Miller's breasts steal the movie every time they appear (she's not a half bad actress, either). And Levitt is by far the best thing about the movie. I mean, the role is pretty crappy, and he doesn't necessarily seem like he belongs, but he has fun with it, at least. The film does contain one pretty awesome action sequence, a chase through Paris with the villains racing to destroy the Eiffel Tower (it might have been wise to avoid showing it falling in all the promotional material, because that is the film's biggest moment). It's well choreographed and you can actually see what's going on, unlike so many action sequences these days. Most of the rest of the action sequences don't live up to that one, though, and the finale is just a cheap rip-off of the Star Wars movies.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

30,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,7,5 August 2009,"I have to confess I'm not much of a G.I. Joe fan when I was a kid, partly because the other Hasbro product in transforming robots had more appeal to a boy than a bunch of plastic figures in military garb. The cartoon series too didn't convert me either, as it was up against a whole host of classic series from MASK to Silverhawks, Centurion to Starcomm. Ahh, the wonderful 80s to be growing up...So while I do not hold G.I Joe in as high a regard as Transformers, between the two films this summer based on the Hasbro toys, I will unabashedly proclaim that G.I. Joe triumphs over the other by a long mile. Michael Bay in his second robot outing has proved to be a two-trick pony, relying on countless of larger than large explosions - hardly a frame passes by without being engulfed in an inferno - and of course, Ms Fox's bouncing assets in slow motion. While one can afford to leave one's brains at the door for popcorn flicks such as these, Bay had forgotten than they have to be basically fun to watch, and magically he had dumbed Transformers down to a mind-numbing bore.Enter Stephen Sommers, who had a couple of box office successes with the action-adventure genre in The Mummy movies, so this guy obviously knows what he's doing, and it shows. Forget the excuse of a story just to link up the big set action pieces, and it is precisely in the action that Sommers understood when to show restraint, add in a dash of humour, pepper it with proper camera angles, though of course still unable to buckle the trend of slowing things down just before any impact. Slow motion unfortunately is here to stay I guess.There are obviously some updates to this big budgeted flick, that while it's still a military- type based movie per se, some common sensibilities have crept in. No more are the soldiers ""Real American"" heroes (though that iconic phrase still managed a mention), and a more inclusive (but still token in a way) United Nations type best-of-the-best elite troopers get invited to this highly classified unit blessed with unlimited budget for high tech weapons and toys. Unlike Bay's invasion-and-conquer type of US troopers, these guys do get arrested after they unleash their weapons of mass destruction, diplomatic immunity not withstanding afterwards. And of course having futuristic toys help to lift this into fantasy-land, than an all out US Military commercial selling the virtues of why Uncle Sam needs you.Sommers also managed to blend in the myriad of characters from the beloved toy lines and series, akin to what Bryan Singer managed to pull off with X-Men, but of course without the cerebral material to go along. Everything here is plain and simple, with black being black and white being white. It doesn't get bogged down with trying to tell the origin stories of everyone, but does so at precise intervals. I suspect if there was going to be more movies, then the case dossiers of the Joes would get their respective air time.Otherwise, like the subtitle mentioned, it's more of a bad guys take all film, where surprisingly the Joes always a step behind, from the first action sequence until the last. It was smart too that the film had action over land, sea and air, covering a wide range of military operations to mop up a growing conspiracy involving arms dealers and nano- technology that doesn't seem to far fetched (in fact also seen before in other science fiction films). The best part of course is echoing some sentiments whenever opportunity allows in lambasting a superpower's policies, including a subtle jibe that most of the world's terrorist type problems, stem from ineptness and how the monster came to grow from within.G.I. Joe was much better than expected as pure entertainment, and you really shouldn't give this a miss as it might just restore your faith in big-action summer popcorn flicks that takes a huge leaf out of their cartoon counterparts. A bevy of good looking, established stars in its casting also helped in making this watchable, even though some, like Ray Park, had to spend all his time behind a mask. See if you can spot an uncredited Brandan Fraser as well!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
31,siderite,Unapologetic,8,19 March 2013,"I only watched Rise of the Cobra because I saw the sequel of the movie getting on the big screens and the trailer seemed nice. I thought it would be something like Street Fighter the movie, so I went with really low expectations. And, in part, I was right. There was no meaningful script, deep characterization or a whole lot of sense, but the truth, the obvious truth, is that the movie did not want to achieve any of that. More so, it didn't even attempt to hide it and that made it better than the drab that is infesting cinema today.So let me get this clear: the special effects are great, the cast is great, including personal favourites of mine like Christopher Eccleston, Dennis Quaid or Arnold Vosloo, and all the rest is completely irrelevant. The film was completely unapologetic about that and that is what I enjoyed. So for me it was an above average action film that was worth watching.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

34,KineticSeoul,Watchable popcorn flick nothing more,6,3 April 2013,"This is a very silly movie that is super cartoony which is understandable. Since this movie is based on action figures and cartoon shows called G.I. Joe but as a whole it's still a lame movie. The story is predictable without the scenarios and actions sequences just isn't all that cool and actually quite forgettable. And all the gadgets and vehicles in this movie is just lame, including the vapid characters and story. When it comes the the technology and just about everything in this flick it's just way too over the top in a childish kinda way. Although few casting is either good or at least decent. Such as Channing Tatum as Duke, Lee Byung-hun as Storm Shadow and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cobra Commander. But besides that this is a pretty forgettable action movie. It's watchable but nothing really stands out about it, since it really lacks substance. It's not a bad movie but it's just a summer popcorn flick with decent but forgettable action sequences. It's much better than ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" which came out on the same year that is for sure, although that isn't saying much.6/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
35,thesar-2,Knowing Joe is only half the movie,8,8 August 2009,"'G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra' was the movie 'Transformers' 1 & 2 should have been. Seriously. And ironically, it never took itself seriously. It also, despite some jokes that simply didn't work, never added in severe childish jokes and extreme adult themes 'Transformers' did. So, as I said, it was the Hasbro childhood toy I cherished come to life with an over-the-top live-action story that I enjoyed as if I was a 10-year-old again. In fact, this was basically made for a 10-year-old in mind. No nudity, sexual scenes (or references,) heavy language and included over-the-top sets (or bases,) weapons and battle chases/scenes. I actually really enjoyed this movie, despite its obvious flaws of mediocre and clichéd dialogue, acting and predictable story lines. This all being said, I had a great time with the absolute, full-on action sequences that quite literally spanned from minute one to the closing; it never let up. Talk about feeding a new generation, especially those with ADHA. Two new members, Duke & Ripcord (aka Lennox & Epps from 'Transformers') to the Special-Ops 'Joe' team help protect & recover a new ""Borg-type"" technology to destroy matter at will. Other than some relationships thrown in, that's all you really need to know. Otherwise, just sit back, remember what it was like to be 10 again, and enjoy.(Here are the only spoilers and should be read by those who've seen the movie): As with 'Transformers,' they changed a few things from what I remember best in the comics/cartoon I grew up on and cherished: The Baroness would never would betray Cobra, no one EVER died (there's multiples in this movie,) Snake-Eye's (my favorite 'Joe') extremely unnecessary back-story & unfortunate painted-on mouth and the birth of Cobra Commander was so far-fetched and his, well, ""mask"" and voice was incredibly off-mark, my jaw literally dropped during his obvious 'rise' in power.",G.I.

36,FeastMode,not good,3,27 July 2021,"This movie is mostly terrible. The characters, dialogue, screenplay. Terrible. Some of the action scenes were useless, especially in the climax. How do you get two martial artists and not have a good fight scene? Either Bad editing or bad directing. The comedy fell flat. There were so many dumb parts and things that make no sense. And it's filled with clichesI did enjoy some of the mindless action, including one chase scene that i thought was pretty awesome. And i guess i didn't mind following the team on their missions in a stupid transformers-y type of way.Speaking of transformers (which poops on this)... while this in 2021, i was thinking the CGI is terrible, but i should give it a pass since it's such an old movie.

37,Robert_duder,Exactly what you could expect...splash splash thump thump,7,3 April 2013,"I have read so many reviews of GI Joe that said the same thing. ""They ruined my childhood,"" ""This had nothing to do with GI Joe"", ""Shame on them!"" Wahhh wahhh! Wipe your snot noses and accept the fact that this was the best iteration of an animated series you could have possibly got. It was exactly what you would expect. Bad acting? Bad characters? Bad special effects? Ummm...did you watch the same GI Joe I grew up with? Of course I loved it too and the action figures were legendary but watch an episode of the original cartoon now...terrible acting, silly over the top bad characters, and literally laugh out loud special effects and animation. At least they desperately tried to make sense of a concept that was incredibly campy 80's animation. So to make a long rant short(er), I enjoyed the movie. I only watched it because I want to see the new one. The action is non-stop. You can't deny the constant barrage of gun fights, martial arts, sword fighting, laser guns, and high technology. The plot is simplistic but it makes sense and is almost believable given the setting and world that they create. I was also surprise/impressed that the film holds a PG-13 rating but still has some over the top violent scenes making it a decent watch for adults. I also think the costumes were very well done and the GI Joe concept holds well in the film.The cast isn't great. In fact most of the performances are really cheesy but maybe that's okay because I said before the cartoon series was incredibly cheesy. Whether we like it or not, Channing Tatum is becoming a Hollywood ""It"" boy. The new film was even re-tooled to give him more scenes. He does an alright job leading the cast as Duke. I have an issue with any script that tries to play Tatum as a ""bad ass"" because he always looks like a pretty boy and he's better off playing that angle. Marlon Wayans does a solid job as the comic relief. He actually has a lot of personality in the film and good chemistry with Tatum. My personal favorite was Rachel Nichols who I thought was excellent as Scarlet. I only wish she had gotten more scenes. Not only is she sexy but kicks some serious butt and the little mini-romance between her and Wayans worked well for the movie. Sienna Miller gives probably the most campy performance as one of the main villains Ana or The Baroness. She is still decent and has some good one liners but the chemistry they try to make between and Tatum doesn't work and is distracting to the story. Ray Park certainly pulls off Snake Eyes as far as the stunts and martial arts goes. He is fun to watch but gets very little personality aside from his back story which also seems out of place in the middle of the action. Byung-hun Lee also plays his role well enough as the evil Storm Shadow. Even without being completely disguised behind a suit like Snake Eyes he doesn't have a ton of personality, just a lot of stunts. Supporting cast include decent performances from Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Saïd Taghmaoui (one of the better performances), Arnold Vosloo, and Dennis Quaid. I particularly enjoy Dennis Quaid and he adds a certain esteem to the cast but he is very underused. Joseph Gordon Levitt has a role that is effective but he should have been used much more given his calibre of acting and his stature in Hollywood, even in 2009. He has a dual role but he isn't really the MAIN villain that he should be. His best scenes are in the last half hour of the film and by the time he becomes his best character it is too late to really become significant in the film.GI Joe (Hasbro) has Michael Bay written all over it proving its not just his style. Stephen Sommers certainly deserves recognition for his work on the first two Mummy movies and I think he does give substance to an otherwise empty action flick. The GI Joe suits make for some potentially cheesy action scenes but somehow it works. You can't fault the film for being boring. It is non stop action and non stop special effects and kudos to them because the special effects don't look completely ridiculous and I didn't notice any major CGI faux pas which is surprising given that it feels like 99% of the film would have been CGI. The scene where the Eiffle Tower is destroyed is unique and cool action scene. Basically anyone coming out of this movie ""disappointed"" with what it is clearly went in with ridiculous expectations. This film is GI Joe, and it is an action movie geared towards teens and early twenty somethings and it succeeds in that. It is the furthest thing from a perfect film but it certainly fulfills everything it could have possibly been. 7/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
38,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Another big, soulless cash in on an old franchise",4,24 August 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Like with the Transformers movie a couple of years ago, I was interested when I heard they would make a movie adaptation of G.I. Joe, as I used to collect the small toys quite keenly when I was younger. At first it does seem like lazy Hollywood writers regurgitating an old franchise to make a bit more money, but maybe there's something more slick going on here. Maybe they made this film to appeal to people like me who brought all the toys when they were younger, relying on the sentimental aspect of it all to bring in the money. Although I went to check it out, something in the back of my mind told me it would be a very flawed film in a lot of regards, and sadly I was proved right.Incredible Hulk/Mummy director Stephen Sommers has crafted a big, soulless vacuum of a film that bears little relation to it's source material at all. It starts with an opening set in 1641 France that is so laughably acted and poorly played you wonder if someone will call 'and cut' to reveal it all to just be the set of a lousy film. And from here on in, we're subjected to a loud, uninvolving, incoherent mess of a film that feels like it's being played a hundred miles a minute in the first part and just drags on and on and on towards the end, making it's two hour running time feel much longer. The main aim of the game here seems to be to see lots of cool machines flying around, cool weapons firing and sexy babes in leather cat suits/khakis (chiefly Sienna Miller as the lead villain who's flawless American accent is one of the few high points.) What patchy excuse for a plot there is could have been written on a serviette from McDonalds, with Christopher Eccleston's rogue weapons dealer unleashing his 'nanobites' weapons to wreak havoc on the world and Dennis Quaid's elite fighting force training some new recruits in the battle against terror. The dialogue's weak and the characters are sketchy. I remember Snake Eyes from when I used to collect the toys, as well as the 'Cobra' organisation, but there's none of the other cool, colourful characters that were there, replaced instead with characters like Byung-hun Lee's Storm Shadow, who's cold and menacing enough but will hold little for fans of the toy collection, apart from his character's relationship with SE.The trouble is, everything I was expecting to go wrong did. I would have liked a real movie for the fans, something made with some affection for the original source material. All I got instead was this loud, soulless, long mess. There'll probably be a sequel. But like the Transformers one, I'll probably take my time getting round to see it. **",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
39,richardchatten,The Alphadogs,7,11 November 2019,"'Team America' had already sent this sort of nonsense up so beautifully five years earlier (even down to the scene where they lay waste to Paris) that filming this straight seemed redundant (except of course this made a mint at the box office, thus paving the way for a sequel). But it passes two hours reasonably enough, the script does contain the occasional witty one-liner, and it's good to see a feisty female (Rachel Nichols) on the team.Sienna Miller makes a satisfying if not very scary English-accented Baroness. But was it a simple failure of nerve - or conviction that they knew better - that made the film's makers revise the geeky spectacles (along with the hair distinctively blown away from her forehead) essential to the dominatrix librarian look femme cosplayers regularly pull off so satisfyingly at a fraction of the cost?",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
40,bowmanblue,Doesn't hold up as well over time,7,17 April 2015,"I'm writing this review after none other than my third viewing of 'GI Joe.' After I initially watched it, I ever went as far as to buy it. Yes, I know it's no work of art, but I enjoyed it enough for what it was –and what it was is a simple, no-frills action movie (mainly for kids, I guess).I never actually played with the toys when I was younger, so I can't say how faithful the film is to the toy-line, but the characters were pretty easy to define as either 'good' or 'evil.' And I enjoyed it quite a bit, both the first and second time I sat through it. However, after a third viewing, something didn't quite sit so well with me.I know it's minor, but somehow the special effects just didn't seem that special any more. Okay, so I probably could tell that real people couldn't really jump over (and through) trains on my first two viewings, but this time round everything just came across as too computer-generated – almost to the point of totally destroying what little realism there was in the film.That said, it was still an okay watch. It's pretty much aimed at kids. The characters are hardly three dimensional and are more 'cool' than well-rounded (probably in a bid to sell yet more toys in their likeness).Like I said... the primary audience is probably young boys, not really fully-grown men like me, but it's a decent enough story about a terrible tyrant trying to manufacture weapons that will take over the world and a team of special operation good guys who are out to stop him.Dennis Quid is probably the stand-out of the film, but he's not young enough to be the star, so his parts – although fun – are limited. Although, even if you are a fully-grown man, you'll probably appreciate Sienna Miller's *ahem* 'performance' in the movie (and when I say 'performance' I mean costume).Whether this is a good film or not, it'll probably keep the young boys happy on a Saturday afternoon (at least until the new Star Wars films come out). But could someone explain to me why they needed to cast a British actor to play the President of America? Surely there are enough American middle-aged actors who could play the small part just fine?",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
41,MLDinTN,an ideal action flick,7,27 February 2012,"I thought this was a good action film. I'm not expecting some well thought out plot or plausible events; this is your basic popcorn flick. The only weird thing was all the flashbacks; you normally don't see that in popcorn films. But the special effects were good and it had a lot of action. I found it entertaining and not silly stunts.The main plot is this guy, Destro, wants to rule the world with his new invention, which are tiny nano bugs that can eat metal. You put them in a war head and they destroy what it hits, then there is a kill switch to kill the bugs. He's working with the Doctor, an evil scientist that has his own agenda and just happens to be the long lost brother of a major character and a friend that Duke thought he had lost. There are 2 female kick #ss characters that can hold their own. Then there is a love story thrown in between one of them and Duke. And the gist of the film is the Joes trying to get the war heads back from the bad guys and they go from the desert to Paris to the North Pole tracking the war heads down.FINAL VERDICT: I found it entertaining and recommend it for action fans.",G.I.

Byung-Hun Lee was by far the best actor in this film, and also the most interesting character, Storm Shadow. The visual effects are also very inconsistent.

Also, you are presented with character-bonding interludes and attempts to unveil the G.I. Joe universe, but I found them very weak (I don't blame the actors, I blame the script). The characters are boring and wack, and the acting isn't very great. The special effects are pretty good but honestly they could have been much more real.

The twist though, with Rex proved to be alive after all and Anna not being bad, was something, but that didn't help the film becoming more interesting. The special effects, were many and very spectacular, however, there were unconvincing as well. The whole technology and super-human abilities were confusing and they didn't seem real.

In addition, I got the recommendation of my twin brother, saying that there was a great chase in Paris in which all is destroyed (and maybe my accommodation, because I live near Eiffel Tower).Beyond this, GI Joe remains more a far childhood cartoon and farther toys (my twin brother used to play with ""Action Force"" instead and received monthly letters, the last one telling that the enemy has invaded the base and that for their survival, they should remain silent!).Right from the start, I find it interesting: sure, for an American action movie, you see always military (it seems to say ""if you don't agree with America, you will pay the consequences"", which is a bit contradictory with America being a democracy!) but I found the battle well directed, edited and with bright colors.Then, as in ""Goldeneye"", the lead bad guy is a very cute brunette and it is great! The story is then twisted by personal stories and you have much more than action sequences! Personnaly, I found the attacks in the bases a bit dull but not boring! For the Paris chase, as in a lot of movies, the scenes are edited in disorder (first, Arc de Triomphe, then, Notre Dame, then Orsay, then Opera: with this, you circle in Paris without getting close to Eiffel Tower!).In conclusion, this movie introduces me to a fine actress, Sienna Miller, and the kid and I have a lot of fun.

50,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Action so gratuitous that the entertainment is lost and the flaws stick out,2,1 February 2010,"Here's my theory on how Paramount and Hasbro teamed up to make ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra."" With the help of the film's creative team, Hasbro designed an entire Toys R Us aisle's worth of G.I. Joe action figures and accessories, everything from subs to jets to tunneling vehicles to Joes in accelerator suits as well as swords and guns and toy explosives. Then they put all those toys in a room lined with tinted glass and filled it with at least a dozen 8-year- olds with diagnosed ADHD and instructed them to have at it. On the other side of the glass were Michael B. Gordon, Stuart Beattie, Stephen Sommers, David Elliot and Paul Lovett, the film's writers, who tried to roughly translate the kids' make-believe story lines into a semblance of a plot.""G.I. Joe"" might be the most offensively terrible and amateur big-budget action flick I have ever seen. It's like driving through an automobile scrapyard rigged with land mines. The action, although intense and sometimes ""cool,"" is so gratuitous that it's rendered completely ineffective. There are dozens of characters all of which are tied to some kind of pointless subplot that reveals their past but only makes them more shallow because it doesn't reveal anything about them as people, just characters. The dialogue also exists solely to explain the gadgets, the plot and move from Explosive Sequence A to Explosive Sequence B and the rest are dumb filler lines like ""nice shoes"" or ""We're going to France? I like croissants.""""Joe"" starts off with two American soldiers, Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) who are sent on a mission to safely deliver these nanomite warheads (weapons filled with microscopic termites that can eat through cities). En route, a mysterious group of fighters led by The Baroness (Sienna Miller) attempt to steal it. They fail, of course, so that later after Duke and Ripcord get discovered by General Hawk and the G.I. Joe team, they can burrow into the base and try to steal it again, this time succeeding. The Joes figure out the big evil plan and then go to Paris as well as the Polar Icecaps to stop it.Although not great films, I enjoyed -- from an entertainment perspective -- Stephen Sommers' previous flicks ""The Mummy"" and ""Van Helsing,"" but ""Joe"" is atrocious. Whatever eye for cool-looking sequences he has is wasted because there's way too much. Nothing sticks out as being ""it was really cool when they did ___"" because every sequence tries to be that way. Action scenes have to work like any other; they need to build up to a climax and resolve in some mildly intelligent manner. Otherwise, it's like watching the grand finale of a fireworks display only the finale is the whole thing and it's two hours long. The finale is not nearly as cool if it doesn't build and create anticipation. Sure, say that ""Joe"" is ""just supposed to be an action movie"" but it doesn't even adhere to those standards.It's pointless to even contemplate delving into the absurdity of the film's plot. Half the events defy the laws of physics and characters too-narrowly escape death, but that's the least of this movie's problems.One of my stars goes to the creative team that designed all these gadgets and vehicles and such. They're clever, they make sense (usually) and they're pretty cool on the whole. The problem is that the movie goes through them like a one-year-old with toys: Play with it for two minutes, throw it to the ground and go pick up that other new shiny thing. Hours of imagination go to waste here because we never get to savor the creativity. The CG work is pretty good on a small scale, but there are a lot of wide shots that look like bad TV effects shots like the desert and even the G.I. Joe base at times. I, as an average film-goer who only knows what green screen is, should not be able to tell when and when it's not used the way technology is today.""G.I. Joe"" is loud, obnoxious and unsympathetic. It's a new cool kid that walks onto the playground and says ""I'm gonna be awesome"" and does something like assume it's worthy of a sequel. I'm not spoiling anything here, after all, the film is called ""The Rise of Cobra"" and the Cobra doesn't rise until the end of the movie. The clunking giant is actually named like a prequel for goodness sake, and that pretentious attitude is offensive when you're not a particularly good movie.Action movies are like candy and in that metaphor ""G.I. Joe"" is like asking you to eat all your Halloween candy in one sitting. Candy is awesome, but not when you eat it all at once, don't appreciate each kind and then get sick.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

You got the finest soldiers around who goes after a rising terrorist organization called COBRA. Their goal is to rule the world. In this movie, they are just building the organization. They are ruthless, violent, and ready to strike fear in the eyes of the innocent. In order to stop them, the Joes must take action before Cobra gets the chance to succeed. When the team pick up up Duke and Ripcord, they have a fighting chance. With weapons and gears so great, the enemy wouldn't know what hit them. Now as a kid, I owned the figures. It's a whole lot of fun. Nostalgia is a good thing, especially when you have experienced the action of G.I. Joe. The movie was non-stop fun, and it was only the beginning.

But the characters we loved in the classic cartoon series. Really don't quite come alive here, most of the actors are so bland and unwatchable. Except for Marlon Wayans, who seems to keep the movies humor on it's toes. But that is it, Channing Tatum is so stiff, he makes Frankenstein look like an Oscar winner. Sienna Miller looks like a poor woman's Kate Beckinsale.Just see it for the action, but nothing else.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
54,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,18 July 2019,"People like me were waiting for a GI Joe movie for decades. It was instead kind of a hack that could have been any other movie.I don't think that the distaste came from the fact that the movie could never live up to memories of childhood play. I think that the distaste came from the knoweldge that Larry Hama had decades of fun and wonderful stories to tell, he had written an entire little universe... and the movie was nothing like it.It hardly even resembled the cartoon.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
55,freemantle_uk,How not to make a blockbuster,2,7 June 2010,"With the success of Transformers in 2007 and the popularity of the G.I. Joe series in America, the bigwigs at Paramount saw fit to commission a G.I. Joe film. But this was a project that was met by production problems, constant re-writing, leaked pictures of the costume designs which were called cheap looking and rumours that there were re-shoots with the director being replaced.In the near future Weapons' Industrialist James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) had created a new nanotechnology weapon which could eat through metal and had support from NATO to create it. American Special Forces were assigned the mission to escort the new weapon, led by Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans). After an unsuccessful attempt by a terrorist organisation to steal the world Duke and Ripcord are recruited by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid) to joint the Joes, a multi-national team of special forces operatives who are the best of the best. There include weapon specialist Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), super-intelligent Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), technical expert Breaker (Saïd Taghmaoui) and of course a ninja, Snake Eyes (Ray Park). But the nano-warheads are stolen by The Baroness (Sienna Miller) and her ninja friend Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) under the order of McCullen. Its up to the Joes to stop the plans of this new, powerful organisation.With a budget of $175 Million it was money poorly spend. The acting is terrible, the action average, CGI that was on par with films from the mid-90s and despite its rewrites, barely has a plot. The cast was made up with actors who are not A-List stars. Tatum is at best seen as an up-and-coming actor; but he is very much in the model of Hayden Christensen: your looks come before your acting ability. He was bad in it and once his looks fade his career will as well. This is not the film that will make him into a star. The producers claim Wayans was cast because of his performance in Requiem for a Dream. That was a lie because he was cast as weak comic relief: but he was still funnier then he was in the Wayans brothers films. Quaid was really bad and whilst Eccleston did try hard, this is no the film to capitalise on his Doctor Who fame. Sienna Miller was very easy on the eye and she did seem to have fun in the film, but she is still only good in Layer Cake. It was also weird to hear Akinnuoye-Agbaje with his natural English accent. He really did not try hard in G.I. Joe and is better playing African characters. The only actor who came out the film with any merit was Joseph Gordon-Levitt who played a sinister supporting villain who becomes important later on.As started the action was average. There were some decent moments, but nothing really fresh or exciting. The CGI was poor and the film did not come up with anything new with it's set designs and just recycled sci-fi ideas: like the invisible suit was a cross between Harry Potter's invisibility clock and the invisible car from Die Another Day and the sound blasting weapons were pretty much lifted from Minority Report and the plot involving metal eating nanos was very similar to a cartoon episode I once saw. Stephen Summers is an gun-for-hire type director. He does know how to deliver an entertaining film, the Mummy being the best example. He basically delivers dumb-fun. But G.I. Joe was particularly stupid, with a plot that was pretty much lifted from a cartoon, with designs to match. It may work in a cartoon but does not work in live-action. One scene was even taken from Team America but done seriously rather then comic.The script was poor! The very basic plot could have worked well, a mad industrialist planning to fire 3 powerful missions at Washington DC, Moscow and Beijing. But it was done in the worst possible way. The film at times was almost like Team America, the serious live-action version, such as the raid on the base and the chase in Paris. The way the film was handled would only appeal to 9-year-old boys who would quickly forget about it when their grow up. GI Joe has also suffered from politics. In the 80s because of the aftermath of Vietnam the cartoon makers decided to make out GI Joe fights against a group of evil mercenaries instead of typical American enemies like Communists. Because of the Iraq War and the un-American feeling towards Bush the filmmakers decided to make the film a sci-fi type film, with the characters not even in traditional military gear. But audience's politics often don't affect their cinematic choice and smart enough to know not to treat films like G.I. Joe and Live Free and Die Hard too seriously. Transformers had a lot of backing from the American military and it was a massive hit. The film also suffered from silly ways how the team finds people and solves situations, such as how the Joes find out where McCullen's base was or the use of a voice-activated weapons system. There are silly things that would only work in a cartoon, like the nano-robots in mind-controlled soldiers and how they were used to do pretty much anything. The film was also filled with plot-holes, clichés and terrible dialogue throughout. The characters, particular General Hawk just spoke in clichés. GI was one of the worst blockbusters in 2009 in a year that was weak for blockbusters.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
56,ebiros2,Expensive and well made,5,13 April 2011,"This is an expensive movie at $175M, and you can tell. The special effects are over the top, and so are the action.The movie is a near future high tech black ops type commando comprised of elite GIs, and Capt. Duke is recruited into this unit. During an on route mission to transport secret nano technology weapon, Duke and his team are attacked by another very high tech equipped soldiers. They they are special soldiers created by a large military industrial corporation MARS. They want to steal the very weapon they've created in order to gain money and control the world.Although on a surface it seems like a characterization of a popular child's toy, I saw many depiction of real world technologies that's rumored to be in existence. Could this be another Hollywood insider information showing up on the big screen ? I've heard that they do this on purpose to hide the things in plain sight. If the rumor comes out about these weapons, people will just say ""Oh, you've been watching too many GI Joe movies."". A very clever strategy.In any case it's a good action entertainment, and worth watching. My only complaint is that the main protagonist is overshadowed by all the high tech weapons that shows up one after another, and makes the focus of the story weak.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
57,dfranzen70,"High-octane, just don't expect nuance",6,8 December 2009,"For a loud, ridiculous movie, G.I. Joe could have been much worse. Sure, it's filled with clichés and implausibilities and the acting is on par with a jelly sandwich, but the story is easy to follow and the special effects are fairly special. Neat gadgetry, too.Movies like this really get a bad rap sometimes, because they are simply slightly controlled chaos. So of course, the bar is set pretty low for these movies. The plot here feels like it's been lifted from the remnants of a James Bond treatment, only they hacked out all the thinky stuff and went with more blowy-uppy stuff. Not that there's anything wrong with that.In fact, one thing this movie has going for it is its simplicity of design. Bad guy steals weapons, good guys chase him to the ends of the earth, good guys save the day, bad guy shakes fist angrily and vows revenge. I mean, you can't get much more straightforward than that, can you? Oh, sure, there are some twists thrown in to surprise you a little bit, but they don't surprise so much as give you something else to think about for perhaps a nanosecond. Bad guys remain bad guys, good guys remain good guys, love interests remain in place so you can ogle them. That sort of thing.A quick glance at the plot: a weapons dealer has created four warheads that can wipe out an entire city...and they've been stolen! The Man who Would Become Cobra Commander might be behind it, as might Destro (said arms dealer). And it's up to the Joes, led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), to retrieve them. Two of the soldiers who let the warheads get away, Duke and Ripcord, join the Joes (yes, here they're rookies, not the veterans from the TV series), but it seems that Duke (Channing Tatum) has a past with the evil Baroness (Sienna Miller), and there's one of your love-interest connections. The other one is that Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) has the hots for Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), the brains of the outfit. That's not saying much in this movie, but trust me, she are smart.But above all else, it's the effects you came to see, and they deliver. We're well past the point where the effects have more personality than the actors, so it's not really a debit. The effects here are awe inspiring, even on a small TV screen. I mean, where else would you see an invisibility coat? Oh, wait, Harry Potter, right. Okay, but they do have these neat suits that allow the wearer to run really fast and jump really high and smash really hard, as if they were all made out of Hulk Hands.So what the movie lacks in terms of such niceties as character development and a logical plot it makes up for with genuinely exhilarating effects that make you feel as if you're right there in the cockpit, or in the submarine, or in the secret lair, or even just roaming the streets of Paris in your robot suit.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
58,MBunge,All I can do is damn it with faint praise,4,27 January 2011,"Michael Bay should be tied down in a chair, his eyelids stapled open, and forced to watch this film over and over and over again until he understands that you can make a big, loud, dumb action movie without it being a complete and utter atrocity.Duke (Channing Tatum) and his best friend Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are U.S. army officers serving as a part of NATO who are assigned to guard a new weapon as it's being transported across Europe. The weapon is a nanotech warhead that essentially dissolves metal, designed by Scottish arms manufacturer James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston). Duke's convoy is attacked by high tech terrorists led by The Baroness (Sienna Miller), a woman with a connection to Duke's past, and he only fends them off with the help of an equally high tech military unit called G.I. Joe. The rest of the movie is essentially Duke and his new friends, General Hawk (Dennis Quaid), Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Breaker (Said Taghmaoui), Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) battling it out with The Baroness and her friends, ninja badass Storm Shadow (Byun-hun Lee) and master of disguise Zartan (Arnold Vosloo). And yeah, the bad guys finally get the nanotech weapons and the good guys have to get them back, leading to one of those never ending CGI battles where the laws of physics are loaded into a rocket ship and fired into the heart of the Sun. We also get flashbacks of the relationship between Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes and of Duke and The Baroness' past and how it connects to their current conflict.Don't get me wrong. This is a pretty bad film but it had the good fortune of coming out the same summer as Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. It stinks, but the odor was barely noticeable next to Transformers, which stunk like a hog house that hasn't been cleaned out in 5 years. G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is overblown and shallow and gets stupider as it goes along, but at least it doesn't assault you every single second it's on screen like a hammer to the ear and an ice pick to the eye. While fairly idiotic, most of the story makes some vague logical and practical sense. While it never rises above crude melodrama, there's not a bunch of extraneous crap roughly jammed in and weighing down the story.Also unlike Transformers 2, where every single thing in the movie was an affront to human decency, there are only a few aggressively terrible parts to G. I. Joe. Channing Tatum is stiffer than a frozen corpse. Department store mannequins show more emotion. He makes Jean Claude van Damme and John Cena look like master thespians. They could have cast any other actor in the role of Duke, even Rip Torn or Kathleen Turner, and it would have been an improvement. They also need the take the person who decided to make Snake Eyes a living action figure with plastic ab muscles and lips on his full-face mask and vigorously horsewhip him. Lips on a mask? Ye gods. And especially offensive to G. I. Joe fans, this movie completely botches the character of Cobra Commander. They screw him up as badly as the Fantastic Four films screwed up Doctor Doom.I suppose some folks would also complain about how the movie has transformed G. I. Joe from an American military unit into an international organization with soldiers from around the world and a base in Egypt of all places. Given the world we live in today, I'm not sure that's such a big deal.This is not a good movie. But if you've seen Transformers: Revenge of the Fallendon't try and pretend you've got any standards. You might as well watch G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
59,TdSmth5,Lots of fun,9,10 August 2009,"I went to see this mostly because Sienna Miller looked amazing in the preview and she sure looks fine in this movie. But the movie as a whole surprised me in how much fun and non-stop action it was. I'm glad to say the the ""critics"" are flat out wrong on this one and am happy to see that audiences responded well.This movie has a great pace- there are several non-stop action scenes with some breaks in between where the Joes gather at headquarters, or when we get some background about the characters. There's a lot of story here, this is not a mindless Michael Bay CGI-fest. There are actually some funny lines and the characters' relationships with each other are well-developed.A new devastatingly destructive weapon is developed by the MARS corporation. They seek to sell it to NATO. But the people at MARS don't exactly have the world's best intentions in mind. The military team in charge is ambushed as they transport this weapon by a mysterious group with powerful weapons. But the GI Joes intervene and two military guys ask to join the Joes to recover the weapon.The two main Joes are Duke and Ripcord- horribly played by a painfully miscast Marlon Wayans- yes that's the skinny Wayans playing a military guy! Otherwise we have a great cast: the gorgeous Sienna Miller, Rachel Nichols- not looking bad either, Arnold Vosloo, Jonathan Pryce, Dennis Quaid, Channing Tatum- all of them doing a great job.There are plenty of action scenes, the most amazing one, a car/motorcycle/foot chase scene in Paris that's just mind-blowing and remarkably well done. The third act taking place underwater is almost unnecessary, or should have been shortened. This is a long movie and the Paris scene would have made for a good climax. Overall this movie is a lot of fun and it is not insultingly dumb as most blockbusters.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
60,Enchorde,Good fun action,6,10 September 2010,"Recap: The McCullen is a notorious and legendary clan of weapon makers and dealers with a dark history of dealing to both sides of a conflict. This generation McCullen is taking sides himself, and decides that selling the weapons isn't enough. He is set to build an empire for world domination. His tool will be the destructive force of metal consuming nanorobots, loaded into four warheads under NATO protection. But unknown agents attempt to steal the warheads, and the attempt would have succeeded unless a third party, the G I Joes had intervened. Duke and Ripcord, two of the NATO soldiers join forces with the Joes as the terrorists seem to have an connection to Duke's past.Comments: A pure action movie, through and through. It is a fast paced mix of martial arts, explosions, thrilling high tech gun fights and a lot of CGI. It is fun and entertaining, all the way. It is rather predictable but that didn't disturb me that much. I didn't expect a surprising, suspenseful thriller anyway, and anybody that does is sadly mistaken.Unfortunately it is taking itself a little bit too seriously, something that is confirmed by some of the makers comments. Instead of really committing to the effects driven and CGI-based action movie, they tried to add a few moments of plausibility. Why, since it is based on a toy, is questionable. It would have been better to go all out, and maybe add a little more comedy to the action.Also, despite having a good cast, Channing Tatum didn't seem totally comfortable in a leading role. Not yet anyway. Fortunately he has got some good support but the cast lacks a real star to carry the movie. The characters are too under developed. In fact, to me it is perhaps Storm Shadow, one of the villains, that is the most intriguing character as there is a hint to something beyond the immediate surface that dictates his actions.However, I enjoyed it and will look forward to a sequel. Hopefully the action will be preserved but the cast and characters given a little more time to develop and feel more like a real team.6/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Channing Tatum gives a really good lead performance and Dennis Quaid, Sienna Miller, Marlon Wayans, Rachel Nichols and Byung-Hun Lee are all good.

62,Samiam3,"Umm.....yeah, a no-go",4,14 April 2010,"Well they don't come much more gimmicky than this, G.I Joe is yet another brainless, tension ridden, hand full of superhero clichés, overused special effects, and ineptly assembled action scenes. Why does action have to come at the cost of even a bit of story or coherency. Derivative as it was, Hollywood can learn a lesson from Avatar. Action/Adventure/and effects should only be used if it serves to better the film not wreck it. The first step to repairing G.I. Joe would be to make it more visually coherent. All the action scenes (which take up about 80% of the screen time) are atrociously edited, breaking all the rules of time and spacial relationships, the camera work is ridiculous, making it impossible to see anything. By the time we reach the climax, which is way too long, you start to get eager for the movie to end. It's not just the action that is so aggravating, the dialogue is terrible. The things people say are so cliché and dumbed down, that you'd think the screenwriters were adapting a comic book word for word. Problems aside, there are a few good shots in the movie, and a couple of laughs to be had (some unintentionally of course). I enjoyed watching Dennis Quade overact, and I have to admire the film crew's decision to blow up a city other than New York (which has been done one too many times)I'm not angry, the critics are right though, this is a waste of money, You'd probably have more fun with the toy.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
63,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A Fun Popcorn Flick,8,21 December 2011,"As a kid, I never was into G.I. Joe action figures. It didn't really grab my attention. Nor did director Stephen Sommers really grab my attention with this film originally. But I ended up going because I had nothing else better to do. I must say that for a person who was never into the franchise, definitely turned the other cheek. I enjoyed this film better than I thought I would. I'm not saying it's great and memorable, but it is fun to watch.This movie is probably why Sommers could not direct The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), which is what I was more interested in watching. Anyway, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra stars Channing Tatum and Marion Wayans as two soldiers who end up finding their way into the secret society of the ""Joes"". That's the other thing, I originally thought G.I. Joe was a specific character. Why would you change it to as name of an organization? I spent the whole movie trying to figure out which the original Joe was. In this film, there's a Commander Cobra, but no G.I. Joe? How did that get passed during the screenings of the script?Appearing as the leader of the ""Joes"" is Dennis Quaid. I enjoyed watching him act. He for some reason reminds me of a Harrison Ford duplicate because of the way he talked. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje is also in this movie and he's fun to watch because of his callous nature. Rachel Nichols plays a character called Scarlett who is just an eye pleaser to watch and I don't blame Wayans character for doing the same. Finally Ray Park, the martial arts man who knows how to amaze us with his physical abilities plays Snake Eyes, the silent but deadly man. He is another character that is great to see move around.Since G.I. Joe is a military force, there is going to be action in here. Much of it is pretty fun to watch. At points it had me just want to hop on screen and do the same. All the guns make good noise and the vehicles have never before seen attachments, not sure if it's a new thing though. Ray Park is great to watch, he's too good with a sword! Besides just swinging a sword, he also does flips, somersaults, rolls anything you can think of. This movie also has some comedic moments but obviously this isn't supposed to be a comedy. And because this is a Stephen Sommers' movie, he has called upon his two most famous actors for small parts. Who are they; Arnold Vosloo and Brendan Fraser. Ten years after The Mummy (1999), they are still fighting on opposite sides. It's almost like his trademark. The music is also good listening. Alan Silvestri composed this music and it goes well with all the action that occurs during the film.G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra doesn't quite make sense in some areas but it's made-up by its good cast of actors, impressive music and fun action sequences. Director Stephen Sommers may not be able to create the most astounding films, but he knows how to make fun ones.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
64,p-stepien,Your average Joe,4,15 January 2011,"G.I.Joe hits the big screen fully loaded and ready to kick some bottoms. This time under NATO command with an international special forces recipe-book. Opposing them Cobra Commander (an almost unrecognisable Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and the whole gang prepped for havoc, mayhem and unadulterated world domination. The plan - create nanomachines that consume anything, then steal them from yourself and when that fails break into Joe headquarters instead of just making a new batch... All masterminded by a group of the most imbecilic masterminds in living memory...The whole movie is an overloaded summer blockbuster with non-stop action, that really could just slow down for a minute, so the audience can catch a breather and actually learn to care about any of the characters. Throwing action sequences at the audiences by the bucket-load the simple truth of less is more quickly makes this movie strike out, especially in the final battle, which is boring, tiresome and just waiting for someone to stop its agony. The only sequence that seems done right is the Paris chase to the Eiffle tower with some amazing visuals and total annihilation rocking the boat without any hurl effects.Nonetheless focusing a bit more on character development and keeping out of archetype territory would have done the movie an immense favour. Given that is a toughie, since most actors are borderline boring, forgettable and bland with just a couple of notable exceptions. Saïd Taghmaoui (as Breaker) and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (as Heavy Duty) have undeniable screen presence and despite little screen time they immediately connect with audiences. Similarly Byung-hun Lee (Storm Shadow) may falter in a couple of scenes with his acting, but the moves and the stone-cold self-aware face are present in abundance. Arnold Vosloo (as Zartan) absolutely steals the movie acting-wise, despite only appearing in about three scenes, so he is an absolute must for any future instalments. Last but not least Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an excellent villain and given the laughable lines he had to sell you have to give him immense credit for never faltering throughout the movie.Especially tiresome are all four lead characters with Sienna Miller (as the Baroness), Rachel Nichols (as Scarlett), Channing Tatum (as Duke) and Marlon Wayans (as Ripcord) fighting it out for the title of the most irritating on-screen performance of the year.Summing it up your average Joe blockbuster with a rushed plot, some great visuals, a lot of explosions and some sub-par acting. Basically strictly for G.I.Joe fans. The rest can move on for some intellectual entertainment. Like Terminator 3.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
65,Rob_Taylor,GI watched it the whole way through and didn't fall asleep...,5,5 October 2009,"Not that it's awful by any means, just not very good. I know it's based on a range of kids toys but, honestly, you'd get more excitement out of filming kids playing with GI Joe toys than watching this movie. At no point was any real suspense or edge-of-the-seat action apparent. And they tried, believe me, they tried. But they failed miserably.Despite the (sometimes laughable) effects shots, nothing remotely like fun ever cropped up. A lot of nice sets, costumes and occasionally decent effects could not combine to make this film worthwhile to anyone over the age of about nine.Of course, this was a Stephen Sommers movie. And on the scale from Van Helsing to The Mummy, with the latter being good, this comes way back down towards the Van Helsing end. Cameos by Kevin O'Connor and Brendan Fraser left me wondering why they weren't more prominently involved in the cast, since the others pretty much phoned in their performances. Especially Dennis Quaid. And Ray Park gets yet another role where he's not allowed to speak, or even show his face, apparently.The effects are fair to middling, but just as in Van Helsing, only casual attention is paid to how objects move in reality. As a result, CGI things tend to float unnaturally or move in unrealistic arcs - you have to watch it to understand what I mean, and I seriously don't recommend you do that.All in all, unless it's for the kids, give this one a miss. It's not a long film, but it will seem to go on forever. But at least you learn a few of Sommers trademark physics idiocies again. This time it's that ice doesn't float - and no I'm not joking either.Not recommended.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
66,Matt_Layden,I Went In Expecting To Hate It,7,9 November 2009,"A top secret organization known as G.I.Joe must take on an arms dealer hell bend on destroying parts of the world. In watching the previews for this film the first thing that came to my mind was ""This is going to suck"". The over the top cheese factor was all over the previews. The suits they wear to make them run faster, jump higher, was ridiculous. Not to mention the horribly miscast lead of Tatum and the out of the blue decision to include Quaid. With all of this going against, I finished the film was a smile on my face. I was...wait for it....entertained. I thought I was going to hate this film, it didn't feel like a G.I. Joe film to me, it felt like they were just cashing in on the character names and fan base. This still feels true, but the film has fun with itself and never tries to be more than the sum of its parts. When you compare it to other loud and dumb action films of the summer, like Transformers 2 and Wolverine, G.I. Joe is better. The plot is inane and they do screw up some characters. They had a chance to do something special with the ""Rise of Cobra"" but the sequences of his ""flashback"" seem wasted. The character himself is weird and nothing what I, or the fans for the most part, expected. Is he bad? In those terms yes, but for some strange reasons he works in this film. He was more interesting than any of the other characters. Scarlett is heavily underwritten as is Heavy Duty. In the realms of this film they do their job, heavy gunner and sex pot. Duke, the aforementioned Tatum is the main character and Tatum plays it wooden. He has a relationship with the Baroness, but it's hastily thrown together and doesn't have the weight it should. The is the same for Cobra and his relationships in the film.The special effects are mixed here, sometimes it looks horrible, such as Destro's face and the obvious green screen moments. Other times it blends in relatively well with the action scenes. The attack on the Joes and the Paris chase sequences are well done and thrilling. I get excited seeing a group of highly trained ""bad-guys"" fight highly trained ""good-guys"". I would guess that's why I liked the movie as much as I did. That and every scene with Snake Eyes. Who, for a character who doesn't speak, has more back story to him than most of the other characters.This film is not as bad as everyone says it is, it is pure popcorn entertainment with over the top action sequences and some cheese. The 3rd act takes place underwater and there are fight sequences in underwater vehicles. It's a neat spin on the space battles you see in Star Wars. I expected trash, got high-octane entertainment. I might be really generous with this score and on a second viewing it might go lower, but as I said before...I was entertained.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
67,pc95,About what Expected,5,31 July 2010,"Taking an 80's shoot-em-up cartoon and transferring it to a 2-hr movie might not be such a good idea. That thought gets validated with this movie. I didn't have high expectations for ""GI-JOE: The Rise of Cobra"", and this movie met those low expectations head-on. The movie suffers from ADD badly. It takes the movie 2/3 of it's run-time to actually dole out some well put together scenes and desperately needed humor - (spoiler) the scene I'm referring here is the centerpiece scene in the movie, the chase in Paris. Up until then, the movie jumps without transition or warning from fight scene to fight scene with mostly low quality, poorly written dialog. As if action is all anyone could want from a movie. Just because a movie is based off a cartoon doesn't mean it has to try to mimic it in-whole. The music is so poor and blandly generic, so indistinct, that it'll have you wondering if you're not in an elevator or supermarket. This movie needed loads more editing and rewriting. It's trying too hard for it's own good. The 'PG13' rating leaves it in a poor state; should've just gone with 'R'. Checked out at the library - the right price for this near turkey.",G.I.

68,brando647,"The Best of the Worst, Summer 2009",7,14 November 2009,"GI JOE was the best of the worst of the summer of 2009. It wasn't as painful to watch as TRANSFORMERS 2 or WOLVERINE; instead, it managed to keep me entertained. It may have been that I was able to enjoy this movie because, unlike the other ""hot"" summer movies of the year, it didn't have far superior previous installments to set my sights high before going into the theater. Or it may just have been that Stephen Sommers recognized that his movie was campy, brainless, popcorn fun and he embraced it and ran with it. Based on the popular Hasbro line (comics, toys, cartoons, etc.), the film has the Joe team in a race against time against Scottish arms dealer James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) before he can unleash his nanomite warheads. Of course, the only aspect of this movie that feels important is that it establishes the enemy organization Cobra, meaning guaranteed sequels.Similar to the films of Michael Bay, this movie is nothing but non-stop action, with a minor pause here and there for plot exposition to keep the audience informed as to who's shooting at who and why. The filmmakers do everything in their power to ensure you won't want/have to think for the two hours you're watching their film. Fortunately, the action scenes are pretty well done and make for a fun time. From start to finish, the film strings you along with a sequence of action scenes, ranging from a STAR WARS-esquire underwater battle to a fight in the streets of Paris reminiscent of TEAM America (what's the point in fighting to save a city if you destroy as much of it as the bad guys?).You can tell most of the casting seemed to be based on how well the actors'/actresses' look matched the character, as skill appears to take a vacation. Channing Tatum was one of the most wooden performances I've seen since Hayden Christensen as Anakin Skywalker in the STAR WARS prequels. Dennis Quaid (in a major supporting role as General Hawk) hams it up, reminding me of a blend of John Wayne and Harrison Ford in his line delivery. Rachel Nichols was awkward, Marlon Wayans was amusing, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt was WTF. Seriously, casting Levitt as the ""Doctor"" is up there as one of the weirdest casting decisions I've seen. The only performances I thoroughly enjoyed in the film were Christopher Eccleston, Ray Park (Snake Eyes), and Byung-hun Lee (Storm Shadow).The movie is loaded with plot holes and poor logic. The acting was mediocre, the CGI didn't always look right, and the story was nearly non-existent. So what makes Sommer's film work? It's fun, above all else, and I feel that's one of the most important aspects of a summer film. I'm not here to convince you that GI JOE's worth your time, I'm just sharing my opinion so you have the knowledge to make your own decision.And now you know, and knowing is half the battle.",G.I.

JOE team uses the latest in next-generation spy and military equipment to fight the corrupt arms dealer Destro and the growing threat of the mysterious Cobra organization to prevent them from plunging the world into chaos. --© ParamountG.I. JOE is a mindless popcorn flick meant to entertain. No more. No less. The quicker you get that through your head, the more you'll be entertained from the film. And this is the reason why I think G.I. JOE succeeds. It's dumb and stupid, sure, but, hell, it's entertaining from beginning to end that nothing else matters.Saying that, however, there is actually some thought put into the plot, although it's the usual ""evil man wanting to take over the world."" I like the idea of nanobots, which is blatantly reminiscent of the idea used in the remake of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. The action sequences are, you guessed it, filled with an average of about 127 explosions each. That's just a guestimation, though because there were too many to count. They were also well done, especially the Paris sequence, which you might have seen in the trailers. The CGI is also pretty fantastic.Channing Tatum is in his 17th time (again, just a guestimation) playing someone in the military and he's pretty convincing at it. Marlon Wayans's character is more of a hit or miss. I laughed at some of his jokes while others failed. Sienna Miller is also surprisingly good in her role, sporting an extremely realistic American accent. I also liked Rachel Nichols, whom I think is an underrated actress.However, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the one who I want to put the spotlight on, not because he was great, but because he was absolutely horrible in his role. What the hell. I highly respect him as an actor but seeing him in this film was an embarrassment. He plays the villain who speaks in a cartoonish deep ""dark"" voice. Every line he spews out as that character is utterly and unintentionally hilarious. This is probably the main point why I didn't enjoy the film as much as I should have.Another problem I had with the film was the origin story between the characters of Storm Shadow and Snakes Eyes mostly dealing with the use of English (you'll understand the problem once you see it). But other than those flaws, I was still entertained by the film's persistent intent at entertaining the audience. The action sequences are utterly ridiculous but so much fun to watch.

It seems that all futuristic movies involving war and espionage will be primarily CGI. There will be some dialogue so some can say there is a story hidden within. Things have gone too far. CGI should be used for effect or to relate a visual that enhances the story. All we saw were weapons and gadgets James Bond would kill for without a license to kill. The movie should not be all CGI with the dialogue consisting of: he's on your six; bogies at 12 o'clock; I got em; incoming; you okay?; look out;....well, you get the idea. I thought we made that point with not-so-kind reviews of Transformers, both of them. Apparently not. These movies with 95% CGI are not movies we are used to, but instead video games gone haywire and we are not at the controls. Oh, but, we hear: the kids love it. Yes, and what kind of message are they getting out of all this?Yes, the CGI was terrific. The acting (what there was of it) and stunts were good. There are a lot of what I call ""no name"" actors. Maybe other recognizable names would not have helped as the actors whose names you do recognize, really didn't have much to say.There is one line I did like coming from General Hawk (Quaid): when others fail, we don't. But, it went downhill from there. Too much non-stop CGI battle scenes make me sleepy. I am surprised I got thru It. I did shut it down once. I fell asleep and had no idea where the movie was when I woke up, but they were still fighting. Oh, Brendan Fraser had a small part as a G.I. Joe Instructor in the beginning. Oh, guess what? The bad guys get away and there are some other issues that were not resolved, so look for G.I. Joe 2. I'm going to have to rest up for that one. Yeah, right.Violence: Yes.

Here is one more film of this kind which is only worth for the visual effects and digital animation as a matter of fact in large profusion sometimes tiresome. The story is a mere pretext to the display of these effects and animation. This is a more than ordinary story in this kind of movies. The honourable guys and the evil ones (the former very good and the latter very bad) are typical. The story develops itself through a series of violent episodes some absurd and even unintelligible. A group of malefactors called the Cobra who are the owners of a high technology intends to lay hold on the world using nanomite warheads. The Joes are a special team of the good ones who fight the Cobra to prevent that they reach their aim.

Then I leave it up to you.This is way too violent for eight - ten year olds - in places it makes Rambo look like Strawberry Shortcake - 10 years ago this would have got an R rating.There is seriously not enough space to say what's wrong with this: I tried to think of an adjective for this and the only one I can come up with is mean-spirited. I though G I Joe was about values, heroism, and glory - honestly when did violence (And I mean real violence not just cartoon type) become these values. There's a kill every 10 seconds: civilians, soldiers, innocents, women, oh heck you name it and the body count is just horrible (Rather than just horrific)We hated the effects which are far too clever and obvious for their own good and a script that is totally set up to lead to the next set piece.After watching the 50th sword kill I gave up - when the kids turn round and say they weren't enjoying it either - and at 2 hours this is an assault on the senses that even Rammstein and Slipknot would be proud of - we just gave up....Sure, some 9 year will love this for its OTT nature - but who decides what's entertainment when this is what they're fed....This is NOT an adventure / action movie for kids.... it is just a load of very violent effects, clever manipulation, some bad language, and bad taste self irony with no class whatsoever.I sincerely hope this is NOT the future of pre-teen cinema...",G.I.

The Other feeling is that they could have done better.The movie try hard to be a great thrill ride. The Action is pure awesome with a lot of cool fight scenes, battles that are so extreme.The Score is very cool with a great mix of music that gets you going.The Story has many things going on. James McCullen who is also Destro is the head of M.A.R.S. a huge weapon company who is also behind the evil group known as Destro.The G.I.JOE team recruits two new members that being Ripcord and Duke. The G.I.JOE team are Duke, Ripcord, Heavy Duty, Snake Eyes, Scarlett (My Personal favorite member of the G.I.Joe team)Breaker, and General HawkCobra has Cobra Commander, Destro, Baroness, Storm Shadow, and Zartan The movie has a lot of plot twist that gives the movie it strong points. Plot Twist is what keeps a movie good.They are a few things wrong with this movie like some weak cast choices and some that should have not been in the movie but it is what it is.And From out of nowhere we get a love affair that was between Duke and Anne who becomes the Baroness that was from out of the blue. Note it was from their past but it changes once Anne's brother Rex who is really still alive was killed in battle.One of the few things done right in The Rise Of Cobra was the feud between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow.Overall G.I.JOE The Rise Of Cobra is a mix feeling movie but if you are a fan of the toys you would give it a try but it is not one of the best but it is not one of the worst movies ever made.I enjoy G.I.JOE The Rise Of Cobra I thought it was a good action movie but it could have been done more for the series.Overall I give G.I.JOE The Rise Of Cobra a 7 out of 10 good action scenes just some bad weak points",G.I.

74,sme_no_densetsu,It could have been worse,6,16 January 2010,"Like ""Transformers"" before it, ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is a movie based on action figures that reached the peak of their popularity during the 1980's. In a clear case of cinematic bottom-of-the-barrel-scraping somebody thought that this would make for a good movie.The screenwriters stick reasonably close to the original characters while amping up the technology to current standards. The references to the source material are sometimes groan-inducingly bad but for the most part the script is fairly reasonable. However, it is undeniably aimed at a younger audience who value things like explosions over story.The acting is decent enough for a flick like this but it's nothing to write home about. A few talented folks like Christopher Eccleston lend a shred of credibility to the film but in the end they just seem like they're slumming it. Oh well, at least there's Sienna Miller looking drop dead gorgeous.The film looks alright with some fairly convincing special effects but they're wasted on a ridiculous story. I was never really a huge G.I. Joe fan but I still can't help but question some of the choices made by the screenwriters. As for the story itself, it's standard 'save the world' heroics with a predictable outcome.Despite its many flaws the movie is still at least watchable, though. The filmmakers shamelessly set up for a sequel which is now supposedly in development so the movie apparently satisfied enough people to make that feasible.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

When the U.S. Army is delivering a nanotechnology-based weapon to NATO, Duke Hauser and Ripcord's team are attacked by a group called Cobra. They want to join General Hawk's G.I. Joe Team. Duke knows The Baroness, because they were going to get married years earlier. When Duke is kidnapped and brought to Cobra's lair, the group must stop Cobra from releasing the weapon that would bring the world to its knees, and save Duke while trying to make it out alive.

77,Sirus_the_Virus,5.9? Are you kidding me?,4,4 November 2009,"G.I. Joe: the rise of Cobra has a title like one for a sequel. Unfotunately, there is going to be a sequel. Most likely because the end hints towards a sequel. This movie has many, many flaws. The acting in is is very bad. The dialogue in it is kind of cheesy. Along with some of the special effects. They spent a ton of money putting green slime on the Eifel Twoer. Well, it wasn't green slime but it looked like it.The plot to this movie is rather stupid. Some of the people in it are kind of silly looking. Especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that great actor, as Sienna Miller's brother. The plot involving him has been used so many times. Sienna Miller may be the only highlight in the film. Playing Ana, AKA,The Baroness. She is a good actress, and she looks good in leather. that is one of the only things that actually pulled me into this movie. I'll admit this. Sometimes, I don't mind a silly action movie(I liked The Mummy:Tomb of the Dragon emperor), but this movie is just a mess.At least The Mummy trilogy interested me a bit. Director Steven Sommers did well with those movies. Not quite the second one but I still liked it. He doesn't do well with this one though. I wanted more of an X-Men type deal. I came in with low expectations, and came out, with a low rating. Not many of the people in it are that good of actors. I don't really like Channing Tatum. That is it. The weird thing about this movie is that is is a little better than Transformers:Revenge of the fallen. That movie wasn't very good either. I didn't like this movie. I have seen better. But I guess if You are bored, give it a go. Give Joe a go. Otherwise, stay away.G.I. Joe:The Rise of Cobra:*1/2 out of ****",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

79,jeremycrimsonfox,Okay For A Movie Adapting A Cartoon,7,13 June 2021,"G. I. Joe is a toyline that has been around since the 1960's. Starting out as an action figure that can wear different military outfits, the brand would be redone in the 1980's, as it would shift from real world military men to a fictional tale of good vs. Evil with G. I. Joe: A Real American Hero. This version is the one people remember most, and would be used as the basis for future media, including this movie, G. I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra, a movie that does an okay job of bringing the Joes vs. Cobra battle to live action and modern times, despite having some issues.Set in the near future, while delivering nanomite warheads made by M. AR. S. Industries, Duke and Ripcord, the two leaders of the team, are attacked by Cobra troops led by The Baroness, whoa are after the warheads. Thankfully, the two and the warheads are secured by G. I. Joe, and taken to their base of operations, The Pit, which is somewhere in Egypt. Soon, Duke and Rip are now part of the team as they have to race to stop The Baroness after she breaks into The Pit and steals the warheads with the help of Storm Shadow and Zartan, as James McMurray, the head of M. A. R. S., is in league with Cobra.So yeah, like the Transformers films, this film is in a universe seperate from the cartoon it's based on. As the movie is PG-13, it will have some stuff the cartoon was never allowed to have (characters can be killed or wounded horribly, and the action is a lot more intense). While it does have some dubious changes (like The Baroness being Duke's ex-girlfriend), it does has some good moments (like the flashbacks that show the past of Snake Eyes, and how he and Storm Shadow are rivals). Speaking of, some of the characters are translated well (they nailed Snake Eyes better than they did Optimus Prime for the Transformers films).But despite all this, the film is still nothing more than a special effects show, as the movie relies on it to make it more believable (especially with the Paris scene). Also, the plot can be a mess at some points.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
80,Joxerlives,Kinda plastic (sorry) but still fun,7,11 December 2012,"As a kid I was a huge fan of Action Man/Action Force (the British version of GI Joe), collecting the figures, reading the excellent cartoon strip in The Battle comic, even getting the novels featuring Action Man's World War 2 adventures. I wasn't too fond of when it got taken over by an American company and Baron Ironblood and the Red Shadows became Cobra whilst all the existing Action Force characters were replaced with GI Joe(and to judge by The Battle's letters page I wasn't the only one). I think it sums it up the difference between the 2 when you compare the villains. According to his official history Baron Ironblood was the disgraced son of a Swiss diplomat who fled Britain after being court-martialed from The Parachute Regiment, becoming a mercenary in Africa and later leader of his own private terrorist army. His family motto (found inscribed on numerous rockets which fell on American positions towards the end of the Vietnam War) was 'Singueno Ferris', literally 'Our blood is of iron'. And Cobra Commander? He was a used car salesman who was bitter that his business failed. So going into the film I wasn't too hopeful but it was actually pretty good. The Paris chase and destruction of the Eiffel Tower was magnificent although it did remind me rather of Team America World Police. The raid on The Pit was also exciting and all the stuff with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow was terrific. I predicted going in that all the male characters would dress like normal soldiers whilst the female would dress like porn stars with a militaristic slant and I wasn't far wrong. Just like Megan Fox in Transformers the makers know the value of a little eye candy and both The Baroness and Scarlet are breathtakingly sexy, the sight of them fighting in their catsuits must have driven fetishists wild with lust. Someone should really count up the number of times the storyline contrives to play up the 'jiggle factor'(and I'm sure they have). Surprisingly violent, especially the scene where Cover Girl get's so brutally and arbitrarily killed off in true slasher pic buxom bimbo style, that really shocked me (although noticeably there's no blood involved). Also is it just me or does Ripcord's plane look the spitting image of the Firefox?As for the bad I didn't like the way The Baroness was so easily redeemed, that just seemed way too convenient. Ripcord's humour just didn't work and grated after a while. Cobra Commander's/Destro's backstory was uninvolving and the way they have the final showdown defies all military logic AND the laws of physics in several different ways.So all told I did enjoy it and might even go to see the sequel at the cinema.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
81,juliankennedy23,G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra... Thinking is Half the Battle.,8,11 November 2009,"G.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra: 7 out of 10: I think I may have liked this movie less had I not recently sat through the two and a half hour opus that is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. GI Joe is like Transformers with a coherent plot and a half an hour of stupid removed. (Notice I said half an hour not all.) First, let us get the ugly out of the way. GI Joe is no longer “A Real American Hero” instead it is a group of foreigners led by Dennis Quaid and answerable to well nobody as far as I can tell. While I understand the change from a cowardly international marketing point of view, it really is a sad state of affairs. However, since all the real heroes turn out to be Americans after all and the bad guys are mostly foreigners from despot countries like Scotland and Japan, it is less jarring of a change than one would suppose.If you can get past the fact the GI Joe Corps is a secret international army (no doubt enforcing the upcoming one world order), has weapons more advanced than the US troops and yet is still inexplicably called GI JOE. (I had assumed at some point Dennis Quaid would declare it is a lame acronym such as Global Initiative something something Expedition alas to his credit he does not.) You still have to deal with some of the casting choices.While I am not overly familiar with the GI Joe mythos, I did see a major flaw on the Joe side. Channing Tatum simply does not look or act like Duke. Now Duke is the main character and everyman of the Joes. If you are familiar with the Duke Nukem video game, think that guy with less one-liners and titty bar visits. Channing simply does not have the charisma or presence to pull of the character and the script does not give him much help.The other character the script torpedoes is The Baroness. She is the bad girl of the GI Joe universe and is played brilliantly by Sienna Miller (It really helps to hire great actors for these roles sometimes). The storyline unfortunately softens the Baroness to the point that by the end Duke is carrying her out of the exploding bad guys headquarters in his arms. (The bad guys lose. I hope that is not a spoiler in a movie called G.I. Joe) The other main characters are well represented. Marlon Wayans plays the black comic relief in the form of Ripcord (Dukes buddy). Normally I am aghast at the ethnic comic relief but Wayans pulls it off with aplomb. Rachel Nichols might seem a strange choice to play a smart woman, but she certainly looks the part and the whole Scarlett is an intellectual meme has clearly been toned down. She and Wayans have a romance that while safe for the kids may make adults in the audience dislocate their ciliary muscle.Rounding out the cast is a bunch of foreigners, Dennis Quaid, Jonathan Pryce as the President and an uncredited Brendan Fraser.The movie has a video game feel and I mean that in the most complementary way. The weapons are out of a Sci-fi shooter. The Joes wear suits cribbed directly from the video game Crackdown (Complete with the same powers); the very well shot action sequence in Paris will be quite familiar to any old school players of Twisted Metal 2.The finale is right out of any Roger Moore James Bond film. This is old school fun action, well shot, with a plot a seven year old could follow. There is some back-story and attempts at depth, but needless to say it is perfectly safe to turn your brain off for a few hours and enjoy the show.The plot is as follows. Bad guys steal evil weapon (Nanobite missiles). Good Guys get weapons back. Bad guys invade good guys headquarters killing cute blond and stealing missiles, Bad guys use missiles on unimportant foreign city (Paris) to show they mean business. Good Guys have their badges take away and are ordered to report to base. Good guys go to bad guys base instead. Good guys destroy bad guys underwater Arctic base by blowing up the icecap causing the underwater base to be crushed by the falling ice... hold on... falling ice???? Yes, apparently in the GI Joe universe the concept that ice floats is just another unproven liberal egghead theory like evolution or the female orgasm. I guess that is what happens when you have a redheaded bimbo play your science officer. (Moreover, do not get me started on the chasing ballistic missiles with an airplane part.) The stupid is strong in this one... but so is the fun.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

83,ajs-10,Spectacular... but flawed...,5,20 November 2010,"I believe that G.I. Joe was originally a toy, an all American hero meant to inspire young boys to join the American armed forces. We have a similar thing over here in the U.K. call 'Action Man'. In the film G.I. Joe is no longer an individual, but a special top secret unit, and the unit is no longer American, but made up from the best of the best from all over the world. I guess Hollywood is learning that there is a bit chunk of the planet that isn't the USA. But more of this later, here's a short summary before I tell you what I really think (summary haters please inject yourselves with nanobots and omit the next paragraph thank you).Captain Duke Hauser and his team are tasked with delivering new weapons, special nanobot warheads, to NATO. They are ambushed but the mission is saved by the intervention of the top secret unit known as G.I. Joe. Having been taken to their HQ in Egypt, Hauser and his sidekick, Ripcord ask to join the Unit, lead by General Abernathy. They go through training under the watchful eye of Heavy Duty and Snake Eyes. Both qualify to join the team. Before they can set off after their ambushers the base is attacked and the bad guys, including Anastasia 'Ana' DeCobray, who has a history with Hauser and Storm Shadow, who is the sworn enemy of Snake Eyes. They get away with the warheads and head for Paris. The bad guys are led by megalomaniac James McCullen, also known as Destro who is assisted by the evil genius the Cobra Commander. The G.I. Joe unit follows the bad guys to Paris where they fight a pitched battle. They escape but 'The Joes' are on the trail and a big showdown is imminent.This film relies very heavily on CGI, which is very well done. There are also some nice fight sequences and the stunt work is all of high quality. The sets are of James Bond scale, giant complexes hewn into the ground or vast undersea cities, all very impressive to look at. It's a shame the same effort wasn't put into the plot. There were too many flashbacks that broke up the narrative and proved more of a distraction than, I'm sure, was intended.I have to say that Christopher Eccleston's Scottish accent as James McCullen is one of the worst I've ever heard, I expect much better from an actor of his standing. Nobody really stood out, performance wise, but I guess I'll give honourable mentions to Channing Tatum as Captain Duke Hauser, Dennis Quaid as General Abernathy / Hawk, Sienna Miller as Anastasia 'Ana' DeCobray / Baroness, Byung-hun Lee as Storm Shadow, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Rex Lewis / Cobra Commander and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Heavy Duty.At the end of the day the great special effects could not make up for an over-complicated plot. It's left wide open for a sequel and I hope the producers take a long hard look at this one before giving any sequel a green light. I can see what they were trying to achieve but I feel they tried to squeeze too much into this film. Over all, for me, although it's visually quite spectacular, it just doesn't work, and so, not recommended.My score: 5.3/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
84,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Army Men go High Tech,7,16 August 2009,"There is something particular about this fairly routine summer blockbuster that makes it more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been. More aptly put it is a lack of something and that is frenetic cutting. This is highlighted during an outrageously destructive chase scene through the streets of Paris when a volley of missiles flies down a street and two of our heroes jump up, flip, and dodge them in an epic camera move that then reveals about ten parked cars behind them that get sent sky high. That one shot is a mixture of many of the things that make action movies great - motion and grace couple with destruction. Realistically speaking that's utterly preposterous, but this movie never tries to be realistic; it's an adaptation of a preposterous cartoon for kids and it is just like that source material. It's a boys' (and also girls') army game rendered in the latest cutting edge of special effects of Hollywood. Brought to the screen by one Stephen Sommers who has made a career out of such things, and while he has yet to give his movies some brains, he is spot on in giving his audiences epic spectacle.There are changes from the cartoon; the heroes aren't just Americans, but rather the best of the best of the best selected from armed forces from all over the World, which is a nice touch. Also, Hollywood's love of acronyms has made ""G.I. Joe"" into ""G.I.J.O.E."" What's it mean? I don't remember, but I think somewhere between a military convoy getting attacked and an underwater military base exploding, by way of the Eiffel Tower falling down and several capital cities being saved from ballistic missile annihilation, they explain it. It doesn't really matter anyway. What does matter is that this adaptation may be a bit too little of an adaptation than some where thinking, it is more of a re-vamping and the bringing into a new age of the cartoon. The many owners of many of the action figures and vehicles from the massive line of toys back in the day will undoubtedly notice that only a few of those things made it into the movie and those that did were seriously redressed. It would have been perfectly acceptable if they at least homaged the classic things... seriously there is mention of the GI Joe Battle Wagon! Or of the GI Joe General. However, seeing that this is merely ""the rise"" of Cobra and not ""the battle against"" Cobra, those things might very well be in line for a sequel, and if they aren't, they should be. --- 7/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence",G.I.

85,jdkraus,Not a bad movie for a rainy day,7,10 October 2009,"I didn't see this movie in theaters initially because I kept finding mixed reviews. But when a friend offered to see go and see it on a Friday night, I said, ""Sure."" Now that I have seen ""G.I. Joe Rise of Cobra"" it proves to be like many of the big-budget, sci-fi films this year, action over plot. I should give this movie no more than a 4/10, but I actually enjoyed it. Maybe it's because it was a rainy day, and I needed an excuse to get out of the house, but I liked it. Yes, there's lots and lots and lots of violent action sequences and even more CGI, which is overall not overdone (though the final battle almost went to the point that it felt like a three- dimensional animated fest) but there is also good, likable characters. I'll be honest, I didn't recognize many of the actors, but the majority of them did a decent job. Unfortunately the villains are two-dimensional and predictable, lacking maliciousness but the good guys make nice characters we can care for. There's the strong, hardheaded, good-looking white guy. The comical black guy. Sexy women carrying guns and delivering wonderful kung fu moves. Sword-crazy ninjas. And the aging, yet determined head boss. What more can be asked for a cast of heroes? This movie is far from Oscar potential nor is it about a first class story, more of a second- class story that kind of thrown in at the last minute. Still, if you're looking for a two hour diversion of a typical action flick with a big-budget, I'd recommend this movie.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

90,DonFishies,A positively dreadful excuse of a movie,2,16 December 2009,"Whether his movies make insane amounts of money or not, I do not think I am alone when I ask how any scripts or story treatments by Stephen Sommers have been approved. Sure The Mummy was a very fun action movie with Brendan Fraser before he descended into parodying his everyman role in every film he has been in since. But since that romp, Sommers has consistently turned out subpar and atrocious work. The Mummy Returns was not a great movie by any stretch, and Van Helsing had very little redeeming it outside of Hugh Jackman's performance. So why else would I even believe to think G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra would be any different? For everyone who claims it was a fun escapist film, or a decent popcorn movie, I ask this question: did we see alternate cuts of this movie? Because I have seen escapist fare, and enjoy just as many popcorn flicks as the next film-goer. But Rise of Cobra is neither. It manages to be so appallingly bad that I can only hope everyone involved is attempting to scrub it from their resumes and memories.Following one of the most inane flashback sequences ever committed to the medium, the film jumps right into the dastardly plot of one James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), an arms dealer playing both sides and criminally intent on nuclear domination. Meanwhile, the worldwide secret task force named G.I. Joe is attempting to stop him, with the help of new recruits and former U.S. army rangers Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans).If you were to turn on a blender and throw in a zany and diverse batch of supporting characters, a gorgeous assassin codenamed Baroness (Sienna Miller), ninjas, deadly nanotechnology that eats through anything it comes into contact with, an intense amount of CGI, people attending conferences and meetings by hologram, a partially written screenplay, a team leader played by Dennis Quaid, a fighter jet that only takes commands in Gaelic, and an uncanny resemblance to Team America: World Police, you would have Rise of Cobra. The movie simply has no idea from the start what kind of action movie it wants to be. It is dead serious about every single piece of technology used in the film (as bizarre and fantastically silly as they not so slowly become), and uses Wayans as the only real comic relief (outside what Tatum calls ""acting""). This easily could have been a very tongue-in-cheek movie based off a wildly popular 1980s television and comic book series, but the film's creators seemed to have far too much reverence to the material.I was never a fan of the original material, so I cannot hold anything against the creators for what changes have been made to plot lines and stories for each character. But I think I can blame them for some of the baffling and inexplicable twists the film takes in order to pad out the running time or extend someone's character in ways they never should have been. Flashbacks are thrown in at any given time, no matter the scene, to help flesh out characters and make certain elements make sense. While it is appreciated, it does not happen for each instance, and in almost all the times they do, they are usually tossed in at the worst possible moments. For what little amount of time I was actually involved in the storyline, a flashback sequence would take me right out of it. I know the script was hastily thrown together in the first place, but these scenes just feel lazy and forced. The majority of them could easily have been better described with a piece of dialogue.While the script was an uninhibited and unbalanced mix of ideas stuck together by what I imagine is a writer's equivalent to super glue, the CGI was even worse and gives X-Men Origins: Wolverine a run for worst effects of the year. Outside of a rather specific fight scene in the final act, almost all of the fight sequences, the entirety of the foot chase through Paris (yes, you read that right) and the underwater battles that close the film, are all computer generated. There is so little effort even attempting to mask these effects that you can still notice the lingering jagged green screen around each character. So little is real in the film that when I noticed the CG'ed robot fish, I almost had to turn off the film. Rise of Cobra makes the effects-heavy Star Wars prequel trilogy look like the original trilogy before George Lucas jazzed them up. I know the effects can only help realize the world of Rise of Cobra, but it just feels like every last dollar not spent on the script or dialogue coaches was spent on making this film look more and more fake.Acting wise, the film is a total failure to launch. Tatum, who is given the unfortunate task of carrying the film, gives wooden actors like Hayden Christensen a bad name. He has been acting for the better part of the decade, and he has still not learned how to deliver dialogue or even look like anything but a gorgeous model. He lacks charisma, and his extended relationships with Wayans and Miller are often times painful to look at. The majority of the supporting cast really does not do a whole lot in their roles, and I genuinely felt disgusted watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has been branching out into brilliant roles in the likes of Brick and (500) Days of Summer, stuck in such a terribly written one-dimensional role.As the title not so subtly suggests, Rise of Cobra sets up for a sequel in its ending moments. I can only hope it will improve on everything here. There are some interesting ideas, a few amusing moments from Wayans, and an awesome fight scene, but not much else at all.2/10.",G.I.

91,gigan-92,A Monstrous Budget in the hands of Ten Year Old Boys,5,23 May 2011,"It doesn't take a film critic to know the original show was purely a marketing gimmick to sell toys and nothing more. With that said the thought of making a movie out of it seems like action-movie 101. Which holds true, seeing as the movie uses every action cliché in the book: The comedic African-American who naturally loves white women, the commander with no real personality (played with less emotion than a rock by Dennis Quaid) who always gets wounded or killed before the final battle or so and of course the villainess who the protagonist refuses to fight because of his love for her. If you're under ten or easily amused then yes you'll most likely be drooling over this mediocrity. The only scene I really felt amped up about was the Paris scene, with its rather good effects, pacing and epic shots, but it's all really squandered by the second grade Iron Man suits. As a fan of Rambo and Godzilla, classic cult action giants, believe me I tried good and hard to simply let go of my analyzing of it all and simply enjoy it but I could not.The constant flashbacks for each character were annoying and the character interaction was dead. The only character I really liked was Storm Shadow, played well by Byung-hun Lee . A lot of the dialogue is half-assed, but there are some memorable and of course cheesy ones that you won't forget. The screen play throws insane plot twists at the end to try and give the notion Stephen Sommers hasn't completely given up on creating something memorable, but all I can do is raise an eyebrow and yawn.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
92,moviesleuth2,Cliché doesn't even begin to describe this movie...,6,3 November 2009,"The special effects are great. The visuals are awesome. The action sequences (which the movie is filled with almost from beginning to end) are actually comprehensible. The cast is made up of rising stars, and most of them are good. However, it's just about all for naught. Everything about this movie is a cliché.The film has three people credited to the story, and another three credited to the script. Watching the movie, it's hard to imagine that's true. Every line, every plot point is a cliché. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. There is not a single new line or idea in this film. I realize that mass audiences are undemanding about their action movies being new and different (and judging by the success of the crap that's out there these days, it's getting worse), but this is a new low.Duke (Channing Tatum) is a soldier in the U.S. Army who has been assigned to carry some nuclear weapons from one destination to another. But his convoy is attacked and destroyed by some mysterious people with some very fancy weaponry. Wanting revenge, Duke and his friend Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) join up with the Joes.It's hard to address the acting because no one is given anything to work with. Channing Tatum gets a bad rep, but I think this is mostly from his being cast as the flat action hero who's all muscle and no brain. Like Paul Walker, he's flat when he has nothing to work with. But when Walker was actually given a part to play in ""Running Scared,"" he surprised everyone (everyone who saw it, that is...it surprisingly disappeared from the box office without a blip on the screen). Joseph Gordon-Levitt is unrecognizable (more than that I won't say, but if you watch the first 20 minutes of the movie, you'll know exactly why), but the voice he uses is so obnoxious--it's like something out of a bad anime from Cartoon Network. I'm guessing that was to ""affectionately reference"" the TV show, but voices like this don't work there either. Dennis Quaid and Jonathan Pryce are merely on hand to pick up a paycheck.I'd say skip this one, except that this is the first action movie in a good few years that doesn't have the inexplicable trend of making all the action sequences indecipherable by a camera on speed and quick cuts. You know what I'm talking about, the shaky cam technique that started with The Bourne movies and was made worse by ""Transformers"" (I'm going to pretend that Michael Mann didn't ruin ""Public Enemies"" by doing this). While it's true that a strong story, characterization and shot placement increase the suspense, the fact that I was actually able to SEE what was going on made the action sequences seem more fresh and energetic. Thank you, Stephen Sommers! If you look at the MPAA rating for this movie, you'll see that this is rated PG-13 for Strong Sequences of Action Violence and Mayhem Throughout. I'm beginning to think that the MPAA has an actual written rule that no big-budget action movie can be rated R unless there is an actual bleeding wound in it. In terms of the amount of violence that's in the movie, it's about equivalent to ""The Passion of the Christ,"" except that here it's just standard order action sequences instead of brutal torture. Yet, the MPAA has STILL found a new low to sink to. People have their heads explode via grenades stuck in their neck, are impaled, stabbed, shot, hit and kicked in this movie, but it STILL gets a PG-13 rating! Blood is avoided to the point of where it stops making any sense. If a person's head explodes, you'd think there would be some gore, or if they were sliced about a hundred times with a sword (and were somehow able to keep standing), they would bleed. Not according to G.I. Joe! See it, but not for the little ones, and only if you're in a (very) undemanding mood.My rating: Rated R for Strong Violence and Language.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

97,judywalker2,Hollywood ruins another comic book series,1,12 August 2009,"GI Joe can only be described as one of the most painful movies to sit through of all time! I remember being a quasi fan of the GI Joe series so I'm not an expert on the 'whole story' for each of the characters, but I do remember enough to know that nothing about this adaptation rang true. Hollywood should have fired all of the writers when they went on strike and maybe they should have included some of the studio heads who green light some of the crap they've been putting out lately.Where do I start with what's wrong with this film: 1. Bad writing. You know the comic book adaptations that work depend on the writers reverence to the source material. Did these people ever even look at a GI Joe comic, cartoon or movie! 2. Like I said before I don't know all of the bad story on each character and frankly, I don't give a crap! If they had done this movie right they might have had a chance to tell those stories in a sequel. 3. Villains have to be fun and this one had a few but the main ones were really stupid. Anyone who knows the series knows what they did just didn't make sense. I only gave the movie one star because of Zartan and the Baroness character (at least before he sudden change). 4. Stupid Black men characters. Shame on Wayans, he's better than this. I would have quit after reading the script. 5. Every movie does not have to have people falling in love; this statement is coming from a woman. Sometimes its just not necessary, especially if its between the wrong characters.I surely hope since they did away with one of their good characters that the intent is to never make another one of these, but I doubt that's what will happen.",G.I.

98,richieandsam,A lot better than I was expecting.,7,10 June 2013,"G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF THE COBRAI was expecting this to be soooooooooooo bad... but I was wrong. I really loved it.A friend of mine, Andrew Nyendwa, kept telling me this was a good film but I didn't believe him because he has very dodgy tastes in movies. haha. But this time he was right.This film is about a military unit in the future who are out to stop a terrorist. This terrorist had invented this missile that can eat away at anything it touches.The effects are not very good in this... there are a lot of scenes where you can clearly see that computers or green screen were used to get the shot. Some of the effects were even comical, but I just thought that added to the fun of this film. This is not a movie that I took too seriously. You don't need to do much thinking, it is just one of those movies that you can just sit down and enjoy.The action is non stop. There so many explosions and fighting scenes. And they were all put together really well. This movie has every kind of action too... explosions, hand to hand combat, samurai fighting, gun fights, car chases etc.There were a few scenes where I thought it ripped off Star Wars. There is an underwater fight, but the subs they use reminded me of the space ships in Star Wars episodes 1-3... it didn't ruin anything for me as I enjoyed this anyway. But I did think of Star Wars a lot during this sequence.The cast list is very impressive actually. I didn't realise there were so many famous people in it. Channing Tatum, Marlon Wayans, Dennis Quade, Arnold Vosloo, Jonathan Price, Sienna Miller, Ray Park, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Christopher Eccleston & Brendan Fraser. Now, there are a few good performances in this film, but to be honest the acting is not great. But this movie is so over the top that if you are watching this, it is not for the acting... it is because you just want outright action/sci-fi. But it was good to see these actor on screen together. They work well together.I will give this film 7 out of 10.I really enjoyed this... and even though the sequel didn't get as many good reviews, i still can't wait to see it.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",G.I.

99,moviemanMA,Enough is enough!,2,17 September 2009,"After watching the trailer for G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, I knew this wasn't going to be the same Joe. Soldiers running around in what look like knockoff Halo jumpsuits, historic landmarks being blown up, and a cast featuring the ""talents"" of Dennis Quaid, Channing Tatum, Sienna Miller, and Marlon Wayans. What could go wrong, right?Good lord, what a hodgepodge of special effects and awful dialogue. There is very little if anything to take away from this film except a sad empty feeling and a pain in your side from laughing so hard. The only somewhat cool parts involve the fighting between the two ninjas, Snake Eyes (played by Ray park, more commonly known as Darth Maul) and Storm Shadow, although their fights are often interrupted by flashbacks of their youths, which is to say the least garbage.I guess I shouldn't lump Quaid in with the rest. He wasn't awful, but he wasn't great. He was himself, scowling, frowning, and looking surprised, upset, and weathered. The others who showed some form of acting ability were Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who is really a cut above the rest), Sienna Miller (although she might be better to look at), and Ray Park, who didn't say a word in the film, and I attribute that greatly to his performance.The story is bad, but not the downfall. The writing falls flat on its face. It's filled with awkward encounters, almost moronic setups, and overall just an embarrassing execution. There were a few moments that had a glimmer of hope, only to be cut down by poor storytelling and an overzealous special effects director.Stephen Summers, the director of The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, and Van Helsing, is not a terribly director. I enjoyed The Mummy a lot (not so much his other films), but he has a knack for entertaining. He certainly gave us some entertainment, but not the kind he was looking to give us. This film is a laugh riot. The story is bad and predictable, the characters are boring, and the special effects/technology used in the film is ridiculous. You can't have a gun fight underwater, not everything can be a hologram, and for the last time a gun that shoots an electric impulse/sound wave is not original!I was tempted to demand my money back from such an atrocity, but I guess it's my own fault. I willingly subjected myself to this film, accepted that it could be awful, and sat through it. Buyer beware I guess. For those interested in seeing it, you have been warned. Yes, it has lots of explosions, gun fights, sword fights, even some scantily clad ladies, but paying to see this movie is truly a crime.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

I was never a fan of GI Joe but have seen some of the cartoons in my early childhood years. Finally on it's DVD release, I went out on a whim to rent this movie with low expectations. Having just watched it I can say wholeheartedly that this movie was FAR more entertaining than that piece of garbage that is Transformers 2!! Despite some obviously fake CGI and special effects; though some were impressive, the film feels like those old-fashioned '80s action movies that relied more on practical effects rather than CGI. Best parts of the movie were the action set piece in Paris and the fight between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. I'm already waiting for a sequel that will hopefully flesh out the characters more with a better story and more practical effects and less CGI. GI Joe has made me become a new fan.",G.I.

102,xamtaro,It knows it's from a Cartoon. And knowing is Half the Battle,8,7 August 2009,"G I Joe: The Rise of Cobra is the latest in a line of big screen movie adaptations of Saturday morning cartoons, following the big but brainless Transformers movie last month.Unlike Transformers, the producers and director of G I Joe know that it is, afterall, a live adaptation of an 80s CARTOON. Instead of going for a real-world contemporary setting, they decided to push the storyline years into the future; allowing the rather far fetched technology like Plasma weapons and nanobots to not seem so far fetched.Before i continue, let me remind everyone that reads this that laser guns, high tech weaponry, underwater bases and futuristic vehicles were constantly featured in the G I Joe cartoon.For better or for worse, this entire movie is a tribute to the classic action adventure Saturday morning cartoons that thrilled an entire generation of children. Unlike Michael Bay's ""wild abandon"" when it comes to action scenes(with little else beyond that), Stephan Sommers manages to balance great moments of ""wow"" with more subtle scenes, then throw in the right amount of humor, an easy to follow story and very likable characters. I'll have to admit that the story was a little too straight forward at times and the characters, though very likable, are a little one-sided......which is exactly like in the original cartoon. Good guys are good guys, bad guys are bad guys. The heroic guy is always heroic, the comic relief is always funny, the diabolical guy is always devious etc etc. What saved the characters from being dull was the excellent script and chemistry that each character had with the others. The acting is natural, the dialogue flows perfectly, the humour is clever and witty without resorting to any sexual innuendo(yes Transformers im looking at you again). It becomes so easy to just immerse yourself into the movie and forget that those are actors playing parts. A romantic sub-plot was thrown in for good measure but don't expect anything too sappy. Again, the romance comes across as very typical of a Saturday morning cartoon. Nothing dirty, nothing lovey dovey, a little contrived at times but it really takes one back to more innocent times of old. Flashbacks are used frequently throughout the film for certain characters to establish their background and their motives. A superb decision to help in characterization but the placement of some of the flashbacks sort of ""takes us away"" from the build up of story, ""spoils the mood"" of some of the scenes.Stephan Sommers knows how to do an action movie, and this one just reaffirms my claim. The shots are clear and easy to follow. Chase scenes are thrilling, edge-of-your-seat, rides, and slow-mo is used at all the right moments to accentuate the impact of the scene. Depending on your own point of view, this movie's adherence to the Saturday morning cartoon staple can be a good thing or a bad thing. It is really up to personal preference. If you considered cartoons juvenile, their characters plain, the plots simple, the romance cheesy, then your opinions about the cartoons would be easily carried over to this movie.G I Joe is an example of how live action adaptations of cartoons should be done. A blend of everything that made the cartoon a classic, without flying into overdrive on the action footage. It is an action adventure blockbuster WITH HEART. A live action cartoon adaptation that is not afraid to admit to its cel drawn origins. I know some viewers would not take too well to the....""cartoony nature"" of the whole show, and again, it is up to personal opinion. To me, being able to re-capture the fun, though flawed, spirit of an 80s Saturday morning cartoon shows how faithful to the original this movie is.People of all ages will enjoy this exciting thrill ride of a movie. Great cast( both in terms of chemistry and eye candy), awesome action(the underwater mini-subs battle was definitely something not often seen in movies) and great fun for the whole family. G I Joe: The Rise of Cobra has won itself a new fan today, me.A little note: The trailers for this movie are very misleading. Don't believe what you see in the trailers. The Exo-suits are just featured in one chase scene and are not a staple of the entire movie. Also, the scenes in the trailer are NOT in chronological order.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

104,bh_tafe3,Big Dumb Fun,7,23 December 2009,"The great thing about TV shows and comics based on enduring premises is that if you live long enough, you'll see them return, and receive reboots for modern audiences. Eventually you'll get to see your favourite story done in the way you hoped it would be.While Transformers suffered somewhat from the decision to throw in some nonsensical drivel about the all spark, into what was a simple God vs the Devil, God gets cornered, creates an army of robots who forget about him, start warring with each other and eventually come together to vanquish the Devil story arc in the original comic books, but it had some Spheilbergian moments and the first one at least was a good film.GI Joe has no such problems, sticking close to the intent and backstory from the comics, but tweaking a few plot points for the better. The effects are well done and the story is perfectly acceptable. This is the year where Michael Bay drew in about a billion dollars at the box office for a film which was simply a 2 and a half hour special effects shot with no story whatsoever. Next to that film, GI Joe's plot of a secret branch of the army trying to stop an evil weapons manufacturer and his cohorts from taking control of the world, is sheer genius.On the acting side the film fares well. Christopher Eccleston, who's the man responsible for the finest small screen portrayal of Doctor Who, is a suitably loathsome villain, and a strong counter point to Dennis Quaid's Hawk. Sienna Miller does a nice job as the Baroness, though I sincerely hope she's back to her cold evil self for the next film. You can't have Cobra without the Baroness. The rest are about what you'd expect for their characters. Marlon Wayans providing the comedy relief, which manages, unlike the idiots following Spike Witwicky through the desert in Revenge of the Fallen, to both relieve tension and be funny, while Channing Tatum plays it straight up as Duke.Ignore the critics.

It is what it is! A guilty pleasure of mine. Full of tricks, details (there is even a guy defrosting pipelines in the background for no reason) and over the top fanfare. Even beautiful cinematography (that shot of the Eiffel Tower from the van for example) and a great cast (aside from the 2 main leads, which I feel are a bit out of place). Baroness, Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow, Zartan.. all winners. It's rare when you can have as much fun watching the bad guys as you do the good ones.For an action movie, it is action 90% of the time and with real destruction. It's funny but not childish, it's smart but not dry, it's very well structure and doesn't waste time. It even has layers on top of the main story. It's 2 hours and it uses every minute of it.

The plot was lopsided but the visual effects manages to help the film's beauty flourish. GI JOE: The Rise Of Cobra 8/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
107,dvc5159,Non-stop action; a good time at the movies.,4,9 August 2009,"Honestly, if you cannot find anything entertaining in this movie, then you can never take things lightly. Basically it's just another toy franchise being tailored for the big-screen. So does it work.Mostly, it does. And with great results, too.You see, every Hollywood trope is thrown into the fray in this film. Smokin' hot heroes. The comic sidekick. The smokin hot villainess. The predictable plot twists. The egotistical super villain, complete with raspy voice. The hero with a dark past. So why does this film works? It's all in the execution.Stephen Sommers' lively direction takes these children's' playthings into a hugely enjoyable summer feast, one that I daresay surpasses the enjoyable factor of Transformers 2. Eat your heart out, Michael Bay! The action sequences are over-the-top fun, that you just forget about realism and just be blown away from the sheer awesomeness in front of you. While a bit of the special effects are dodgy, no one can truly dismiss the fact that it is a whole lotta fun, and the movie is chock-full of action sequences. Not to mention the usual terrific music score by the ever-wonderful Alan Silvestri, that really gets the pace of the movie going.The actors do a substantial job with what their given. Channning Tatum is okay as the pretty boy lead, but he could do better. Marlon Wayans is good as the comic sidekick, but not without getting some action on his own. The others do very well, especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who looks like he's having a blast playing the diabolical villain. Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols are drop-dead gorgeous in their roles, so much that I didn't notice their acting, especially the former. And Stephen Sommers is generous enough to bring back three of his previous collaborators; Arnold Vosloo as a henchman this time instead of the baddie, and special appearances by Brendan Fraser and Sommers regular Kevin J. O Connor.In short, I liked it. I don't know much about critics or the cartoon either, but it's a damn good time at the movies. Since this is the last big movie of the summer, catch it if you can.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 7/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Great actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Dennis Quaid, and Jonathon Pryce should be sewing their agents right now. They are wasted in worthless roles. It's too loud, too silly, too flashy, too long, and too boring. The bad guy's plan makes no sense at all. Yes, I am more than aware that this is an action film, but I want at least some realism in here. The bad guy's plan: use warheads to eat up the whole earth. It's such a stupid plan in a stupid movie. I can't believe they even made this. Everyone should be ashamed of themselves for participating in this filth. I can't believe that good actors looked at this script, and thought it was actually worth using their precious time on. How can anyone think that this was worth making? Our time on this planet is too short to make crap movies like this. It's literally like being stabbed in the ears. Paramount, Spyglass Entertainment, Dennis Quaid, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jonathon Pryce, Sienna Miller, Christopher Eccleston, Stephen Sommers should all be ashamed for partaking in such filth.",G.I.

The recruit only the best from around the world (a bit like a team of military Batmen).So we join the story of Duke, who survives an encounter from some mysterious attacker and then gets rescued by the G.I. Joes. He joins them and we get a brief training segment.At which point a reasonable entertaining movie, with characters I care enough to watch breaks down into a poorly executed CGI illogical mess.It is entertaining enough, perhaps way too long (over extended action sequences).

111,Quebec_Dragon,G.I.Joe not a real American hero anymore,5,13 August 2009,"It's not horrible or very good, it's a big-budget military sci-fi action flick banking on boys' nostalgia to sell the movie and all the inevitable tie-in products. So let's skip the acting that goes from minimalist poseur to unemotional plastic (except for the women) and focus on the quality of the action scenes. They are mostly exciting, especially the chase scene with the tech suits, but they sometimes suffer from a very frenetic nervous camera. Fight scenes in particular are cut extremely rapidly and it hinders or hides the choreography of the moves. The special effects themselves look good (they should considering the budget) and sometimes awe-inspiring such as when they go down in the G.I.Joe base. The vehicles are usually more sci-fi than military looking and sometimes look computer-generated. During the big underwater battle, I was actually getting tired and losing interest. Did it go on too long, was badly shot or didn't I just care anymore at that point? I'm not sure.Overall, the plot was serviceable but predictable. It doesn't stick close to the cartoon or the comics but it didn't bother me. The characters did look good visually especially Scarlett, Storm Shadow and the Baroness. Just to nitpick but the ""mouth"" on Snake Eyes, otherwise looking cool, bugged me. There's the undeniable appeal for old fans to see known heroes and villains in live-action. Not particularly important in this type of movie but the dialogues were especially mediocre and the wisecracking comic relief by Marlon Wayans was just severely lacking but perhaps one should blame the writing and not his delivery. The few romantic aspects were terrible probably due to the total lack of chemistry between the actors involved. Perhaps to appeal more to international markets, G.I.Joe is now an international elite covert group and it doesn't particularly glorify the US military. It would be easy and politically correct to trash this toy tie-in film but I was moderately entertained, not as much as the first Transformers film which was in all ways superior, but still I wouldn't pay full price for G.I.Joe at the movie theatre. It was kind of fun but my ""enthusiasm"" slowly waned past the Paris scene. I would definitely skip it if you're a woman who dislikes that type of loud superficial American action film unless you feel generous and want to accompany a boyfriend.Rating: 5.5 out of 10",G.I.

112,tburke85,G.I. Joe A Flawed Action Adventure,4,12 January 2010,"G.I. Joe is a flawed action adventure from director Stephen Sommers whose okay in bringing this movie to the screen but some major problems weight it down. This film seemed to have been made so they can show lots of action and special effects but spectacle alone doesn't make a good movie or hide a poorly written story with too many characters. I prefer Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, or The Departed which had many characters who didn't hurt the film but made it better because they were at least developed to the point where you knew them a little bit before the action kicks into high gear. G.I. Joe is just action, action, action, action. action, with little character development, a so-so story which has too many characters, sub par performances, and some cringe inducing dialogue. The cast turn in decent performances including Sienna Miller, Ray Park, Rachel Nichols, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Marlon Wayans, Christopher Eccelston, and Channing Tatum but this isn't their best movie. Jonathan Pryce, Arnold Vosloo, and Dennis Quaid show up for brief roles that are nothing more than a few extended appearances. Brendan Fraiser even shows up for a cameo with little to no dialogue. The rest of the cast are okay but none of them stand out. The special effects aren't the greatest resembling too much like a cartoon and the same goes for most of the action sequences. If you want to see some exhilarating action sequences see Batman Begins or The Dark Knight because those felt very realistic and not something made up in a computer. Overall G.I. Joe was decent but I'm glad I didn't see this in the movie theater and I got it for free from the library. If you're a big fan of the toy line or the show you might enjoy it more than I did. But I prefer character development with a compelling story to go along with the action but hey that's just me.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
113,jonathanruano,GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra -- A Review,2,21 September 2009,"My expectations for this film were not that high to begin with when I entered the cinema; and yet GI Joe was still able to disappoint me. The film can essentially be reduced to three themes: hot women, action scenes and explosions, and it does not get more complicated than that. It is virtually impossible to identify with any of the characters, because they spend all of their time engaged in physical combat. And when they not engaged in physical combat, we see several flash backs which are about -- guess what? -- even more physical combat. And the actions scenes are not even very good. They lack the excitement, the craft and the dynamism of the fighting in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood,"" ""Rob Roy"" and ""Braveheart,"" and since we do not have any sympathy for the characters, we do not really care who wins.Now it would be unfair to say that this film does not have a plot. But the plot is so thin as to be almost unrecognizable. The movie is so crowded with action scenes that there is little room for character development or a narrative that could entertain us. Apparently, the screenplay writers, the director and producers assumed that since special effects were enough to sell the film anyway, there was no need to put that much thought into a good screenplay. Little wonder less than ten people saw the film with me in a gallery that could have seated more than one hundred.So for me, the problem with this film essentially boils down to two things. First, the script was not yet ready for production. A lot more editing and work needed to be put into developing the plot, developing the characters and reediting. Second, what few remnants there were of a plot were in service of the film's special effects, instead of the other way round. The director and producers should have studied the film ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Although ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" is a very different movie from ""GI Joe,"" these films have one important thing in common: they both use special effects. The difference is that in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" the special effects are used to advance the plot, which is why this movie works so well and why we can imagine a fantasy world where real life and cartoon characters coexist. In GI Joe, the thin plot is a pretext for the special effects, a strategy which has demonstrated time and again to be one that simply does not work.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
114,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Take it for what it is, and you'll have a bit of fun.",5,13 August 2009,"This isn't a movie one expects much depth or detail from, so you won't get much from this review, either. What I will say about G.I. Joe, is that it knows what it is, who it's going to entertain, and why it's being made. I credit this to Stephen Sommers, who is actually pretty good at entertaining an audience with less than acceptable story lines and actors, as his entries to the ""Mummy"" series have proved (notice how the third one was dreadful without him?). Sommers may never win an Oscar, but he, like Michael Bay, knows how to entertain an audience (though it's an insult to put Sommers on the same level as Bay, as I think he's a better director than good ol' Michael).G.I. Joe is about as subtle as a brick through a window. You know what you're getting from each scene, character, and action sequence. The guys with guns are loud. The leaders (good and bad) are cheesy. The girls are hot (all of them). Yes, the movie is basically Sommers pointing the camera in a direction, then making whatever is in the camera's line of sight either explode or host a fight scene (all of which are incredible). Another plus of this film: all the action is extremely well choreographed and planned out. All of the fight scenes are of very high quality, especially those with Snake Eyes.As for our performers in the film, it's really a grocery store variety when it comes to how good they are. Let's start with the bad. I'm really not holding back here. Channing Tatum has got to be one of the worst actors I've ever seen. At least Keanu Reeves makes his monotone performances badass and can make even a few facial expressions. There is no emotion in Tatum's performance, which I feel compelled to tell you is one of the worst I've seen this decade. Marlon Wayans is basically a stereotype with more to do than usual, while Rachel Nichols was a lot of fun to look at, and she was good as Scarlett as well. Sienna Miller looked like she was having a fun time as the Baroness, while Christopher Eccleston took himself way too seriously. The performers who were having the most fun were Dennis Quaid (seriously?) and the always wonderful Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who's over the top, loud, and cheesy performance is ever so appropriate for this film. I couldn't wait for him to reappear every time he left the screen.When it comes down to it, G.I. Joe is one loud, well designed, poorly CGIed, and hilariously acted ride that really, honest to God, is never boring. Stephen Sommers makes a movie that entertains, is BETTER than Transformers 2 (though that's not saying much), and has a bit of heart to go with it. Really, everyone involved looked like they were having a blast (besides the god awful Channing Tatum), whether it be older comedians (Wayans), All American actors (Quaid), or former indie darlings (Miller and Gordon-Levitt), and though I didn't quite have a blast, it was a fun way to spend 2 hours, as it never outstays its welcome and is exactly what it presents itself to be.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
115,Jay_Exiomo,Kid stuff,5,5 August 2009,"With a pre-release buzz that has been nothing short of lethal (fanned into bigger flames by Paramount's decision to withhold press screenings), ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" has its work cut out for it arriving to theaters amidst the insinuations that the prospective summer blockbuster would be a crippling blow off to director Stephen Sommers, perhaps not unlike what ""The Island"" was to Michael Bay or ""Stealth"" to Rob Cohen. Sommers' action figures-turned-action movie, however, neither attains the extreme maladroitness its defamers assume it to be courtesy of sporadically engaging moments and a zestful turn by Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- though it's not to say it lives to early high expectations via surprisingly high aggregated ratings -- frustratingly leaving the film in a somewhat oddball state of mediocrity.This exhausting blend of CGI and contrived one-liners focuses on the genesis of the Cobra Organization, charting Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord's (Marlon Wayans) entry into the G.I. Joe Team where they are to fight mysterious villains intent on torpedoing the world into a bedlam through nanotechnology-based weapons. Sommers' hooey patchwork of blockbuster cacophony resembles a futuristic ""The Mummy"" -- an analogy maintained by Arnold Vosloo playing a villain and Brendan Fraser's cameo -- and ""Van Helsing,"" where flamboyant chaos take over competent acting, all the more highlighted when the self-deprecating charisma of Fraser and the gruff appeal of Hugh Jackman is replaced by the graceless Tatum.Paying lip reverence to human drama via flashbacks of its dull characters, ""G.I. Joe"" unfolds all too predictably with unconvincing fight scenes and, save for a marginally engaging chase scene in Paris, ho-hum action set pieces that never match up to Sommers' early works. The outcome isn't an awful experience, but neither is it a gloriously engaging one. Early scuttlebutt speculating it as the worst film of the year may be a bit overstated, though it's unlikely the film itself will stick to memories long enough.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

117,jerekra,Solid Film.,8,11 August 2009,"I saw G.I.Joe with no real high expectations. For the most part I thought that it was a good film that was entertaining.Basically it is about a secret government army organization called G.I.JOe who takes in the best military people from the world. They are battling an evil corporation that will go on to become Cobra.The action and effects are pretty good in this film. THere is no lack of action in this film and it gets going early so it is quite action packed. At times the effects look a little too computer animated, but well done for the most part.The characters are good and bad. Duke I did not think was well portrayed in the film and was nothing like how he was in the cartoon. Also I did not like how Destro was portrayed in this film. Cobra Commander was quite good at being evil, as was Storm Shadow. Snake Eyes was awesome.There are some good looking women in this film that give this film a tremendous x factor. Barrones was extremely hot, and a great villainous. Great at being evil and something that you like to see. Scarlett was quite hot as well. But man, Baroness is something that was awesome.So, great action, most of the characters were cool, and some good looking women. Recommended.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
118,TheHande,Review by Hannu Mäkinen,7,31 August 2009,"This review is in the form of a 10-point questionnaire (1 point per star):01. What did I think of the title? - First part is good and snappy. The subtitle felt unnecessary though.02. What did I think of Duke? - He's a straight-backed sort of hero who only wants to do the right thing. Not the most personal of main characters but sympathetic and human enough that you sort of root for him.03. What did I think of the villains? - Brilliant and varied, each slightly more preposterously cartoony than the last. Chris Eccleston was obviously my favorite and I can't wait to see him in the sequel. I was waiting around for Cobra Commander to show up and he didn't disappoint (that was just a fantastic voice). Everyone just stood out.04. What did I think of the supporting cast? - Rather surprisingly I felt the supporting Joe characters didn't stand out nearly as well as the villains. They were distinguishable from one another but no-one really stood out as particularly interesting. Snake Eyes was cool and even got his personal character arc.05. How did it match up against Transformers? - I have to say that I find human actors playing human characters a lot easier to relate to than gigantic CG robots to be honest.06. What did I think of the CGI? - Oddly, it didn't bother me as much as I thought. There was definitely an excessive amount of it but it all seemed to be there to serve the over-all look of the film. It was justified, just as in Transformers and with the giant-robot factor lowered it perhaps helped accept the CG better.07. What did I think of the flashbacks? - They were rather abrupt but I liked the fact that they tried to give the characters some history.08. What did I think of the Internationalized Joe unit in comparison to the Real American Heroes of the original cartoon? - This one's a toughy. Obviously this was done to better appeal to international audiences, but I'm kinda tempted to see what the film would have been like with a more US central approach. It could have potentially added to the entertainment value but in the long run might have undermined the film's credibility even further.09. What did I think of the soundtrack? - I actually enjoyed it but during the action scenes it just got buried under the sound-effects. A bit of a disappointment because I was enjoying it so.10. What did I think of the ending? - Bring on the sequel. It was nice and ominous.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
119,fung0,"Too Many Explosions, Not Enough Story",6,11 August 2009,"Opinions seem to be equally split on this film, but the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. It's not terrible, and is far from the worst action film of the year. On the other hand, it should (and easily could) have been better.* The stars are likable and the acting is adequate. Christopher Eccleston is the major exception: he's the one real actor on board, and his powerful performance as the villain does a lot to help anchor the whole film.* The dialog and bits of behind-the-scenes drama are just about right for a film of this type. Comic quips are somewhat predictable, but well-timed. And the bits of back-story (efficiently doled out in flashbacks) give the various characters more than enough depth.* The plot is straightforward (essentially just a long chase), but perfectly appropriate to a cinematic comic-book. And more than sufficient to justify a good assortment of action sequences.* Best of all, those action sequences work extremely well. Under Stephen Sommers' flowing direction, the big set-pieces become almost lyrical. The initial battle in the woods is exciting, and the Parisian power-suit chase is near-classic. The invasion of the GI Joe base by Cobra forces includes a lot of really cool fights between individuals. It's all perfectly choreographed, with just enough emotional background to hold our interest.Where the film goes wrong is in losing its human dimension in the last third. For starters, it abandons real-world locales for a set- and CGI-bound Arctic wasteland. The Paris sequence works so well because it's set in a familiar, believable locale. The Arctic battle fails because it lacks that contrast between the mundane and the fantastic.Worse, the final battle takes way too long to tell not nearly enough story. Stephen Sommers should have cut a good ten minutes out of the Arctic section and devoted that extra time to developing the various plot lines. As it is, the film spends too much time wallowing in pyrotechnic special-effects that have less and less impact despite their escalating volume. It's like either some Hollywood exec insisted on more explosions, or Sommers himself feared being too subtle. Either way, it's weak storytelling.Even with that flaw, GI Joe delivers a pretty satisfactory experience. There are no huge plot holes. The characters are likable and the action plentiful. It's a decent popcorn movie, and slightly frustrating only because it could so easily have been so much better.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

122,RichardSRussell-1,"Not Too Bad, Not Too Good, Certainly Not ""Just Right""",5,13 August 2009,"Transformers 2 has just passed Revenge of the Sith for #9 on the all-time domestic box- office charts. I rated it as ""2: awful"" (no accounting for tastes, I guess), so I just shook my head at the news and dreaded having to attend its Hasbro extended-infomercial stablemate G. I. Joe. It wasn't nearly so bad. Not that it was actually good, you understand, but at least it had a followable James Bondian, ""evil genius wants to rule the world"" plot with a few minor surprise twists, some identifiable (if consistently 2-D) characters, some really impressive CGI visuals, and action that was slowed down instead of sped up at crucial points, making it easier to follow.The cast is listed in alphabetical order (apparently so as not to upstage the characters Hasbro's trying to peddle), so you have to be attentive to notice that Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans (down near the end of the alphabet) are the ostensible heroes as Capt. Duke Hauser and (unknown rank) Ripcord (unmentioned family name), respectively. Wayans, who made his chops as one of the funnyman Wayans brothers, has some mildly comic bits, but nothing that would detract from his primary persona as an action hero. Rachel Nichols (good gal Scarlett) and Sienna Miller (bad gal Ana) supply the eye candy, with Dennis Quaid (Gen. Hawk) and Jonathan Pryce (The Prez) in minor supporting roles providing what little gravitas the film can muster.Mars Technologies, run by the latest of the arms-peddling McCullen clan (replete with thick Scottish accent) has been selling both offensive weapons and defensive fortifications to opposing sides in various global conflicts. (The modern McCullen learned one lesson from his ""man in the iron mask"" ancestor who pioneered that business practice: Don't get caught doing it.) The latest innovation from Mars is nanomites, teensy metallophages capable of rapid reproduction in a metal-rich environment such as, oh, say, the Eiffel Tower. As the movie opens, the 1st 4 nanomite warheads are being driven from the Mars factory in Kyrgyzstan to their NATO purchasers when the convoy (including our heroes) is ambushed by some spiffily high-tech ninja types. But then there's a counterattack from what turns out to be the top-secret G. I. Joe force, and Duke and Rip, having learned that it exists, are recruited to serve.After that it's all wham-bang, smash-boom, robot-suited shoot-em-ups, but done quite well, with occasional moments of heroic introspection, evil cackling villainy, and brief ""origin of"" flashbacks in between.It's PG-13, which means there's an abundance of killing but a dearth of blood and leftover body parts; a plethora of beautiful, healthy, physically fit bodies but no sex; and a thesaurus full of braggadocio and posturing but no cussing.Not too bad, not too good, but I sure wouldn't call it ""just right"". 5.",G.I.

Maybe because the expectations for TS4 were much higher?? The script is lousy not to say moronic, the direction is awful- not only the director cannot direct actors, he even cannot direct action sequences. If they were well made never-mind about the rest, but the action is blurry, chaotic, a hundred cuts a minute, the camera gets into actors nostrils almost. The dialogue is mostly poor too. In addition the CGI effects are weak, artificial, like in a 1970s movie. In a movie based on a game it is inexcusable. Basically whatever bad could be said about Terminator 4 the same can be said here. Even the ""babe factor"" is taken to new heights here: every girl on show has to be like a top model. I knew things were wrong after just 1st minute, not only the French quash a Scottish rebellion here (sic, ha ha ha) but the director has them put a red-hot mask on the Scottish ""villain's"" face. Give me a break, a bit of realism here could be useful, nobody survives after a red, almost white hot metal is attached to your face. In Paris they demolish a few streets and many cars with people in them, and apparently the French police find out about it all only after half an hour?? Pleeease. And so on and so on. Rubbish.

Critics hate movies like this.Overall: As stated, it is the last of this year's summer blockbuster, enjoy it. This is one of the movies you either like or hate it.

127,BigGuy,"Fairly entertaining, if you don't think too much",7,9 August 2009,"First of all, I have to say this isn't the G.I. Joe that you watched twenty years ago where everyone safely ejects just before their plane blows up. Although there is surprisingly little blood for the number of people who get killed/injured.Really, G.I. Joe is a near-future sci-fi action movie. The acting and plot are on the simple side, and the action is on the PG-13 side, but it does fulfill the basic objective of being a couple of hours of mindless fun.As is common in movies such as this, I was more impressed with the acting of a lot of the supporting actors than the main actors. Vosloo was chilling and convincing as Zartan, and Byung-Hun Lee did a great job as Storm Shadow. But most of the rest of the Joes and Cobras showed as much depth as their plastic figurines. That being said, the lack of depth doesn't really hurt the film.There were a few things I found a bit jarring, but that has more to do with my personal biases. Such as, why is ""G.I. Joe"" a NATO team? The term was used to describe U.S. soldiers. I understand the need for name recognition and a wider fan base, but it's a bit offensive. Actually along the lines of American/Not-American, why is a Brit president of the US? Spoiler Alert: I also wish they had spent a little money on a science/technical adviser. I can understand and easily forgive the whiz-bang future weapons such as the disrupter guns. But when they blew the ice pack and hunks of ice started sinking? An ICBM that only goes Mach 5 (which is uncatchable by anything the Joe's have) and an airplane that goes Mach 6 which can catch both missiles heading in opposite directions? And someone really needs to look up atmosphere.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
128,colinrgeorge,"""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra""",5,6 April 2010,"""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,"" didn't have the star power, the state-of-the-art special effects, or the epic trailer the sequel to Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" did, which is maybe in part why I found it so ludicrously, stupidly charming.Despite a critical tongue-lashing, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" took in just shy of 110 million dollars in its opening weekend. The role and effect of professional film criticism were called into question. America had willingly seen a bad movie.But unlike ""Transformers,"" the war against ""G.I. Joe"" was fought much more intimately than from the critical Mount Olympus, domain of A.O. Scott, Roger Ebert, and Peter Travers: ""Joe"" was being trashed by the back alley bloggers and the fanboys it wanted so desperately to impress.The (admittedly terrible) trailer was widely ridiculed, and late rumors of the film being completely re-cut prompted tall tales of its legendary awfulness the internet over. These thoughts stirred in the back of my mind as the first reel began to unspool. Stephen Sommers' (""The Mummy,"" ""The Mummy Returns,"" ""Van Helsing"") latest film opens... in 1641, France. Alright, you got me.Silly childhood favorites suddenly sprung to mind, like ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers,"" or ""Independence Day,"" as more recent misunderstood TV-to-film experiments (""Speed Racer,"" ""Land of the Lost,"") resurfaced. All of a sudden ""G.I. Joe"" felt like an underdog. The imagery and the dialogue are often laughable at best, bad, unquestionably, but in a nostalgic, over- the-top, cartoony sort of way.The plot is incomprehensible, but less so than the garbled mess of ""Transformers 2,"" and the films are equally dumb. So why was it that as I sat in that curiously narrow theater, I suddenly felt compelled to come to old Joe's defense? It's not franchise nostalgia, as I was only peripherally aware of either series or toy line as a child. Somewhere between the obviously expositional flashbacks and the gleefully destructive actions sequences it struck me: I was having fun.The pretension of the ""Transformers"" films, their high-contrast doom and gloom aesthetic, and those shared by equally uninteresting blockbusters like ""Terminator Salvation"" and ""Watchmen"" was replaced by full-fledged puppy-dog film-making that celebrates what makes those films fun, and yes, what makes them cheesy.But even as a just-for-fun flick, ""G.I. Joe"" wears out its welcome by the end, during a forty minute submarine/airplane/ninja fight sequence that precedes a ""Return of the King"" esquire bait and tease of false endings and fade-outs. Half the theater was in the aisle by the time the credits rolled.It sounds silly to say, being the sort of movie-poster quote you scoff at on the way into the theater, but ""G.I. Joe"" is Stephen Sommers' best film, which, yeah, isn't saying much. Is ""Rise of Cobra"" worth your time, art snob? Probably not. It's not as innovative as ""Speed Racer"" or as funny as ""Land of the Lost,"" but anyone that grew up watching early nineties television (as opposed to mid-eighties television, when the cartoon actually aired) might find a place for this campy action throwback in their hearts.It's still got that stigma, though. Those stinky green lines that make even Michael Bay's most staunch supporters dry heave. The truth is ""G.I. Joe"" is twice the film ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is, forty minutes shorter, and an infinite amount more fun (zero times X is...).But the best that can be said for old Government Issue Joe is that he knows his place. And knowing is half the battle.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
129,kunalkhandwala,"Incredulous plot, ordinary acting but visually exciting",6,15 August 2009,"Paramount Studios and Hasbro (maker of Transformers & G.I.Joe toy series) attempted a movie version of the popular animated series several times but got around to finally making it only after the success of Transformers in '07. The animated series had a special bond with an entire generation of action figure enthusiasts who grew up watching their favourite G.I.Joe characters save the world from the evil plans of Cobra. Unfortunately though, Stephen Sommers' rendition of the legend escapes too far away from the world of G.I.Joe that is known to everyone. G.I.JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA pretends to be very futuristic, techno oriented and over-the-top in its story and action which is a far cry from the original series. Yes, the nanotechnology, advanced weaponary, hyperactive suits and space-age vehicles is all impressive in the beginning but that was not what G.I.Joe was all about. The elite military unit was just contemporary in its weapons, vehicles and technologies but its strength lay in the diverse capabilities of its individual members. As a team, they were always invincible against any world dominating attempt by Cobra but the movie overlooks these critical aspects about G.I.Joe and indulges unnecessarily in technology, random blasts and annihilation. As promising as the title sounds, the movie is not really focused on Cobra. Fans must not watch the movie expecting a story about the rise of an evil power as we saw in 'Revenge of the Sith' as the focus on Cobra is only towards the end of the movie when it all doesn't matter anymore. There is nothing as sinister about this Cobra but thankfully, there isn't anything tacky and cartoonish either. The becoming of Destro, the astute plan of Zartan and the flashback to the childhood of Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes are the only saving graces of the movie in terms of characterization. Baroness takes an inexplicable turn towards the good side simply because of her affection with Jake! Come on! It's G.I.Joe! There never was a love story in here! Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes have a lot of Ninja fighting as one could have expected but there is absolutely no chemistry for the audience to see or any compassion for the audience to feel. Jake and Heavy Duty appear to be enacting the soldiers from 'Transformers' rather than G.I.Joe recruits. Scarlett is the eye candy in the movie and nothing more while General Hawk is the only character we can associate with as being close to the real animation series characters. In the end, after the destruction of Moscow (that hardly seemed to affect anyone), half of Paris (good change from blowing up Manhattan all the time) and Cobra's underwater arctic station, G.I.Joe save the world in a manner more unconvincing than what He-Man single handedly would do. The movie even makes one of the lamest attempts to remain open ended for a sequel but Stephen Sommers blew up enough of our G.I.Joe world already to let us anticipate anything else. What most people may have overlooked this year is 'G.I.Joe Resolute', which was an 11 episode animated series of 5 mins each that came out in early 2009. This series was not futuristic at all. In fact, the visuals were similar to the T.V. series of the 1980s but the story telling took a more distinctive human approach with an epic encounter between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow with a glorious flashback that puts everything in place for their characters. Cobra's devilry is more deceiving than ever and it cripples G.I.Joe that can only launch a defensive operation in individual units led by a small group of its members. Thus showcasing each character's strengths, weaknesses while asserting the fact that G.I.Joe is not just about weapons and vehicles. If only Stephen Sommers had accumulated the script and screenplay from G.I.Joe Resolute and made a movie, it would have turned out to be an exhilarating epic. Alas, we have instead been subjected to mediocre direction, screenplay, characterization, below average performances, dull soundtrack, inane plot and technical wizardry that almost takes G.I.Joe to Star Trek levels. Nevertheless, it remains a mindless summer action flick that entertains with its thrilling over-the-top action sequences and the battle of good against evil little to offer for the nostalgic fans of the original series and by no means the revival of one of the most popular action figures on screen. 6.77 on a scale of 1-10.",G.I.

From start to finish, the entire tone felt cheesy and there were shades of Batman and Robin comic book dialogue. While I'm sure that someone with a rich GI Joe knowledge would be excited to hear names like ""Destro"", ""Ripcord"" and ""Storm Shadow"", I cringed each time I heard them.There was a lot to dislike, but I did not hate the film. I enjoyed the Paris nanomite scene and I thought that it was visually fun to watch (especially the GI Joe and Cobra headquarters). At the end of the day, I liked GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra but there were way too many issues to make it a ""good"" film. The plot was contrived, character development (especially the motivations of Rex) were non-existent, the script was lousy and the acting was mediocre.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Joe - The Rise of Cobra
133,RCWjr,Entertaining for those not familiar with GI: Joe,6,9 August 2009,"The thing with this movie, you really need to have little to no emotional connection to what GI:Joe is/was. The movie, though based on the characters created in the Joe universe, bares no resemblance to what many of us grew up with. For those who are 15 and below, this is going to be a fun run. But for many like myself who are 40-something, this movie is neither a reflection of what we all have known to be GI:Joe and ultimately wasn't made for us. This is not supposed to be ""your father's GI:Joe"".Personally, I did not like the whole multinational aspect of GI:Joe. It has been changed from an American fighting force to one that is comprised of the best warriors from all over the world. Fine enough in today's NATO peace keeping force attitude, but still, GI:Joe is slang for an American fighter. A small thing to some, but for me, someone who grew up with GI:Joe representing the best of America, this is a huge compromise. Additionally, the characters are shown flaunting major dress and appearance violations. An example, during a flashback, Duke and Ripchord are shown in their Class-A Army uniforms, both sporting goatee's. Then you have GI:Joe female enlisted members with their hair hanging down like they are in a Barbie joins the Army movie. Again, something that removes you from the supposed military aspect these characters are supposed to be a part of. Lastly, the super suits are nothing more than an excuse to sell more toys and find a way to use 100% CGI characters in place of real ones. In regard to CGI; some of the worse CGI I have seen in a long time. Somers is known for having hokey CGI work in his movies, but there is never a time that the CGI looked anywhere close to real. Which is I know an ironic statement to make about a movie based on a action doll and cartoon, but still, you need to have a little reality to keep you invested.The story is actually pretty decent, though I am not sure about giving Snake Eyes a back story, but all in all the story is kind of engaging. Performances are also good, nothing Oscar worthy, but all right on par with what you would expect from a summer popcorn flick. Wayan's actually didn't get on my nerves as much as I thought he would.All of the characters for the most part were brought to life in a decent way. You can forgive the Baronesse not having an accent given how great she looks. Interesting that they create a connection between her and Duke. The biggest disappointment I had was the reveal of Cobra Commander; he looks like Jason from the Friday the 13th movie that went to space. Disliked how they rendered his look.All in all, this is a movie targeted not at those who grew up with GI:Joe, but to their 15 year old and under sons. It is entertaining enough for them, but will be a disappointment for those of us who first shouted ""yo Joe"".",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
134,jaredpahl,Pure Summer. Pure Popcorn. Pure Action. Pure Fun.,8,23 August 2019,"Take all the elements of the traditional summer blockbuster; Action, gadgets, humor, special effects, toys, colors, dopiness. Mix them all together and boil that mixture down until all the excess character development and heady themes evaporate away. What you're left with is a potent drug. Pure, distilled summer fun. What you're left with is G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.Based on the Hasbro property (toys and a TV show), the G.I Joe film crafts a story around the mythology of the show. Something about a conflict between two secret military factions. Who really knows, who really cares? I'm familiar neither with the toys nor the tv show, so I have no connection to G.I. Joe, Snake Eyes, or any of the other apparently beloved characters from the G.I. Joe brand beyond what they look like. The beauty of Rise of Cobra is that it's better that I don't. Because director Stephen Sommers, the helmer of some of the best goofy summer extravaganzas of the 90s and early 2000s, understands me. He gets that all I care about in a movie like G.I. Joe is the surface. He knows that my inner 12-year-old wants things that look cool. The plot is precisely as ridiculous as it needs to be to allow for a bunch of cool looking stuff to fill the screen.Needless to say, the sets, costumes, vehicles, and guns are ridiculously cool looking. There is something invigorating about a movie that only cares about being entertaining. Rise of Cobra is laser-focused. Dedicated solely to ""awesome"" moments and ""badass"" toys. As strange as it seems, there aren't many films with the guts to do that. Most of the dumb summer action movies releasing today have some element of character (a dead family member or something) or a half-baked theme the filmmakers hope you will chew on at the end. Not G.I. Joe. Action, effects, humor, and not much else. Of course that philosophy wouldn't look so admirable if the action didn't work. So let's be thankful for Stephen Sommers. He has the mind of a teenage boy and the skill of a Hollywood maestro. Few other mid-level directors stage fight scenes better (the stuff with Snake Eyes is simply gorgeous to watch), and he seems to have a knack for designing high-concept set-pieces. A dissolving Eiffel Tower and a super-charged foot chase are terrifically inspired ideas for over-the-top action scenes. And G.I. Joe is generic enough a property where the ""anything goes"" approach feels natural. Underwater submarine machine gun battles? Sure. Ninja sword fights? why not? Bionic exo-suit chases? Hell yes! In the world Sommers has created, gunfights and car chases are not enough. Here, everything is cranked to glorious overkill.There are ""good"" summer blockbusters out there that entertain and engage. There are better movies than this. But isn't it wonderful to have a film like G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra? A gleeful feast of cinematic junk food. Delicious, savory junk food, served up by Stephen Sommers, a filmmaker who specializes in ""guilty pleasures"". I think the sentiment sells his gifts short. In his own goofy way, the man is a craftsman. His movies pulse with fun. G.I. Joe is fun in its most basic form. Summer popcorn action injected directly into the veins. Let us hope this is not the last adventure we get from the Popcorn Auteur.81/100",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
135,piratecannon,Wait? A Solid Movie Based on a Toy Line?,7,27 December 2012,"Making movies based on popular toys is a concept that's been around for a while–and, really, it's a no-brainer from a capitalist standpoint. When it comes to the quality of these movies, however, the general rule of thumb is that they're almost always lackluster to one degree or another.Lately, though, there have been some respectable flicks generated in the wake of the resurgence of various toylines from the 1980′s. Having been born in 1982, this is an especially joyous thing for yours truly. As an 8 year-old, I absolutely loved the 1990 release Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. However, I have to admit that watching it as a 27 year old is a completely different experience. Even though it will always have a special place in my heart, the movie takes itself way too seriously, and, at times, is unintentionally laughable. The 2007 animated reboot (titled TMNT) is a different story altogether. It's got some familiar elements of the earlier films in terms of trying to add some characterization to six-foot tall turtles who know karate, but, on the whole, the movie seemed to be aware of the fact that it's designed for kids and that the overall product should be something akin to a fun, relatively mindless amusement park ride.Tonight has seen yet another motion picture incarnation of one of the great toy lines of my generation–G.I. Joe. After glimpsing the trailers for G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, I expected the worst. Well, guess what. It's a movie that will pleasantly surprise you with its copious amounts of camp and pure, unadulterated fun.The plot involves nanotechnology, ninjas, and international terrorism; a recipe with ingredients that shouldn't be taken seriously. Thankfully, the cast and crew who created G.I. Joe seemed to know how ridiculous the whole thing is and appropriately decided to focus their energy on making a mindless action flick that includes actors/actresses who actually have fun with their roles, jumping into them with a delightful degree of hamminess. And hamminess there is, from the dialogue to the action and everything in between. I laughed throughout the entire runtime of G.I. Joe, and, to my amazement, was genuinely thrilled by many of the action sequences (despite their intentionally hokey nature). The best of these scenes features our heroes, Duke and Ripcord (played respectively by Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans), racing through the streets of Paris in modified combat suits that accelerate all of their movements. Cars are launched into the air, missiles are dodged, and general mayhem ensues as the pair tries to stop the bad guy–exactly what you'd you expect from a movie based on a line of toys that features steely-eyed military men with awesome weapons. And, as previously mentioned, the humor is non- stop. Some of it falls a little flat, but this movie is cheesy on purpose, and it uses said cheese to great effect. The camp is literally lathered on, and it makes the whole thing a carefree hoot.Unfortunately, the only person who doesn't seem to be on the same page is Channing Tatum, playing the central character of Duke. For the bulk of the film he seems to feel that Duke is a person who has an unshakable cool and somewhat muted sense of drama about him. This is all well and good, but when compared to the sheer ridiculousness of the other characters in G.I. Joe, this is a really odd phenomenon–one that's not repeated anywhere else in the movie. Even his love interest sees the need for camp (and unapologetically heaps it on, despite the fact that he continues to deliver each of his lines via the unconvincing and awkward medium of the startlingly inappropriate ""grizzled/committed"" soldier persona). The more of Tatum you see on screen, the more you realize what a drag on the overall effect of G.I. Joe he actually is.But just ignore all that. You'll want to see this movie for the explosions, the insanely cheesy humor, and the ever-so-cool battle/fight sequences. G.I. Joe won't appeal to everyone, but if you're looking for a completely mindless night at the movies, this is your ticket.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
136,liberalgems,Totally Harmless Fun!,10,10 August 2009,"There's only one scene of gruesome violence. The actors have decent chemistry. The sets are imaginative. The story is entertaining enough. I would even call GI Joe more science fiction then anything else. This is a fun B-movie, something safe enough for even older children to enjoy.Sure, GI Joe gets most of it's ideas from much better movies like the Matrix, X-Men and the Manchurian Candidate.So I realize it would be easy to tear a film like GI Joe to pieces! But the story made me laugh, at times, for being so preposterous, and it was entertaining without going overboard.

The action packed movie is full of graphic death and violence. Let's face facts, they aren't tossing mud pies at each other. The technologies are very nearly plausible for a near future show.The actors did a pretty good job and I would have to admit Christopher Eccleston did a fine job as Destro. I really wanted to see more of Arnold Vosloo as Zartan. As a personal note about the whole series in general, whoever came up with the nicknames for these comic book heroes?

The story is so weak but the action replaces what the story couldn't do but then the action can be pretty boring sometimes, because every second it's blowing up this or that. The suits are quite cool and the chase is awesome.After having an encounter with the bad guys, two army soldiers realize that a group called the G.I. Joes' secretly save the world when we don't realize it. After that the story drops down and the action gets high, maybe too high.G.I. Joe is probably the worst movie from Stephen Sommers and that just shows that your favorite directors can be a little bit unpredictable.

The acting was just terrible and the performances from almost all of the actors were like puppets, sure there was movement but where is the emotion? Channing Tatum was the worst in this case. The people who brought you Transformers decided to revive this and bring it to lifeif there was any sign of life in itat least Transformers had the leading male who could show emotion. The cast was just a joke when it come to acting, although the action scenes were pretty good to watch.The characters in the movie were seriously stupid and didn't even know it and was therefore instantly annoying. The 'jokes' weren't funny in the slightest as they tried way too hard to make it a funny, action movie. The only good thing about the movie, the only shining light in this dull movie I could see, was Sienna Miller as Ana. Sienna Miller was absolutely wasted on this movie but not even she could save this movieif I can even call it a movie.

144,JimD73,"Very stupid, but very fun",7,13 August 2009,"After Transformers 2, I didn't have high hopes for the next toy-based movie. The fact that the first trailer for GI Joe looked laughably bad didn't help either. However, as the last big action movie of the summer, it seemed necessary to at least give it a chance. With the right expectations in mind, GI Joe actually managed to be worthwhile in spite of its stupidity by simply being that damn entertaining.The plot is hardly worth discussing. Some big bad guy comes along, steals warheads, has diabolical plot, etc etc. Its not particularly poetic, but it doesn't need to be, it just needs to have some sense of urgency. Unlike Transformers which tried its hand at mythology and such, GI Joe keeps it simple and is all the better for it. The heroes are heroes, the villains are villains, motives aren't really explored so thinking is kept to a minimal.The focus is instead on the action scenes. The movie follows the setup of big action setups separated by ten minute plot breaks, so its obvious where its heart lies. The action scenes are usually ridiculously cool, with plenty of high tech gadgets (ranging from an invisibility suit to pulse guns that shatter glass floors). A handful of ninja sword fights between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow are all very impressive. In terms of classic punch-kick-shoot action, this is probably the most well done action movie of the summer.As anyone who's seen the old GI Joe PSA's can expect, GI Joe is cheesy as all hell. The Baroness runs through a mall in a chase sequence, slowing to say ""nice shoes"" to a passerby. When these moments appear randomly in a movie, it can really bring it down, but GI Joe uses this enough to actually make it part of the entertainment. I had as much fun making fun of the movie as I did with the action setups. Yes, this is the kind of movie where a bunch of heavily armored grunt run around commanded by a skimply-dressed Sienna Miller, yet the armor doesn't work as well as a healthy dose of cleavage. Your ability to enjoy so-bad-its-good may influence how much you like the movie.Of course, sometimes it goes too far. A fight with the child Snake Eyes in Tokyo is beyond awful (Japanese children are apparently very rude). The end twist with Baroness is incredibly groan-inducing. This takes a lot of the satisfaction out of the ending, but at least the references to ""knowing is half the battle"" and ""kung fu grip"" are all funny rather than forced.The cast of Joes pulls a very smart move by removing the jingoism from the All American Heroes. Now, instead of the whitebread heroes of the toys, we have a multiracial, multinational assortment of heroes. It doesn't come across as forced anti-racism, and flows very well thankfully. We still have some dislike for the French, however.The cast isn't particularly great. Quaid is a suitable leader and has the presence to pull it off. Wayans can be annoying at the start, but eventually gets comfortable as Ripcord. Nichols and Miller are both sufficiently hot such that acting is a non-issue. Tatum is the big weakness, giving no character of any sort to Duke, just a bland face for the girls to scream over. Joseph Gordon Levitt definitely had a lot of fun with his role. The less said the better, although I compare him to Igor given an unfortunate amount of power. Also good is Ray ""Darth Maul"" Park as the silent Joe Snake Eyes.Every boy used to play with his toys and make them fight in ludicrous situations, whether they be GI Joes or whatever toys he could scrap up (Raphael and Batman had some very epic battles in my youth). GI Joe plays out exactly like those did in our minds, pointless but very fun. If you can put your mind in neutral and enjoy the cheesiness, GI Joe is a fun night at the movies.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
145,rstef1,G.I. Joe vs. Transformers,6,3 November 2009,"So this week I rented both G.I. Joe and Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen. Guess I felt starved for mindless action and, brother, is that what I got and in large doses.I find Channing Tatum a likable actor, and in Step Up, a severely average movie, he showed he has charisma on screen. However, Stephen Sommers seems to have performed a charismaectomy on him in this movie. He's supposed to be the center of the film but instead gets blown off the screen by everyone around him. Sienna Miller as the naughty countess/ex-fiancée runs rings around him in their scenes together, she's quite good. The ever-so-annoying Marlon Wayans mugs so much in his scenes that he walks away with them. Even Chris Eccleston and Joseph Gordon Levitt hamming it up as the leering, sneering baddies make Tatum look like a wooden pole. With such a void at its center it poses a problem for the film.It doesn't help matters that so many characters are thrown at the viewer, most of them in such short snippets (what was the point of using Brendan Frasier in his little cameo?) that we don't get much sense of who they are. Jonathan Pryce and Dennis Quaid deserve so much better than ten minutes of screen time as the President and Joe team leader respectively. I would have liked to see more of them, but that wouldn't have left time for the hundreds of explosions, gun battles and combat scenes that we all paid to see.For the most part, the chases, stunts and action scenes are exciting and handled well, despite a few CG letdowns like the chase through the streets of Paris. The Robocop suits and stunts looked really silly after a short time. Stephen Sommers knows how to direct action, but when the action stops, so does the film. Clearly these characters are based on toys as they have about as much dimension, especially Duke.The worst part is that the movie doesn't give you a proper ending. I'm getting sick of these big budget films that simply set up the next film in the franchise, giving you no closure. With the lackluster performance of this film at the box office, it may or may not even spawn a sequel. I think I preferred the shenanigans of Transformers a bit more. We got to know the characters and care about them a bit amid the carnage and explosions. And though they too set up a sequel, they at least gave us a proper ending to that film. Who knows, maybe Hasbro's next toy commercial/action flick will pit the Joe team against the evil Decepticons. I might pay to see that...",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
146,lopcar1993,"A dumb, silly and cartoonish attempt at creating a viable vehicle for the G.I. Joe franchise",2,30 October 2009,"Lately Hollywood has been trying to Monopolize on the success that Hasbro has created over the years. First in 2007 Michael Bay directed the adequate adaption of the ultra mega popular toy line and cartoon animated franchise Transformers, While his attempt was good it didn't quite make the cut as great as it could have been. Then in 2009 he made the horrible and audacious Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen which was shortly followed by Stephen Sommers G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra which in turn was no different than Revenge of the fallen except, that Rise of Cobra had terrible CGI bad plotting and a really terrible script, It's a film that is easily the worst of the year and it 's number two to Revenge of the fallen.When I first saw the trailer G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra I instantly thought, ""Wow this is going to be an awesome movie!"", my expectations were high when I entered the movie theater to see it. But when the light's came back and the credits rolled the smile that was on my face quickly evaporated. Now Why do you ask did that happen? Well let me break it down for you. 1.) the plot , while interesting was shallow and was riddled with bullet holes. also it's story was nothing like that of the G.I. Joe animated series or comics and was way to fast paced and packed with wall to wall action that really brought down the value of the film and killed the story. 2.) The acting, while not as bad as it could have been was terrible and very shallow especially from the senior actors in the cast. 3.) Stephen Sommers(the director of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns.) crafts a poor script and mediocre direction, which is shocking for the man that created one of the greatest film of the 90's . But all in all this film tries very, very hard to be good and plausible entertainment but falls to short.Dennis Quaid(Who has been failing lately to make good films.) Is alright in this but can't seen to elevate his character past being nothing more than a High School football coach. Channing Tatum(Who needs a new line of work.) Is terrible as Duke the leader of G.I. Joe he's too young to play the part and not very convincing as Duke. He doesn't have what it takes too be the character, but he does give it all he's got which, sadly is not much. Sienna Miller(who tries her best but is degraded to eye candy.) She is even less convincing as Baroness(I mean she didn't even have a Russian accent.) She has the look , the style and the sexiness to play the part. But she lacks the cruel nature of The Baroness and the cunning nature that made her a great character. Rachel Nichols(you may know her from P-2.) Is completely wrong for Scarlett. Again she's got the look the style and she's even got the sexiness down, but yet again she lacks the conviction and even the acting skills to play a tough smart women like Scarlett. Ray Park(Who is the saving grace in this film.) Ray Park does great as Snake Eyes and he is the only reason I went to see this movie in Theaters, seeing as he doesn't say a word he's one of the best of the cast. Joseph Gordon-Levitt(Who is the second class act in this.) He is great as the Doctor and does his very best in this and comes out on top. But none the less the cast tries there hardest and fails to elevate this film to greatness but it falls hard on bad direction and a poor script and acting.G.I. Joe rise of Cobra is a high class action film with low class T.V. special effects and mediocre acting, it tries hard to be convincing and emotional at sometimes but it fails miserably. While Sommers had a great idea he couldn't quite get it off the ground and this film had the chance to have wings but it doesn't quite learn how to fly. But all in all it's a good popcorn flick, but nothing more beyond that, it is very entertaining at least but even that can't stop it from getting on your nerves from time to time. All in all a good attempt at making G.I. Joe a viable film franchise but sad to say it doesn't come even close. It's good to watch if your bored or have nothing else to see. But beyond that it's not worth going to see in theaters or buying for that matter. All in all G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra is an A- Bomb.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
147,misbegotten,It's the Bad Guys (and Girl) who make this film worth watching,6,11 August 2009,"I saw this movie without any high expectations, simply because it's directed by Steve Sommers. Like Paul Anderson and Michael Bay, Sommers is a quandary: a clearly talented individual who churns out movies that are very well-made and highly commercial, but which can usually be described as falling somewhere between 'disappointing' and 'appalling'. Of his previous efforts, DEEP RISING was workmanlike and unremarkable, while THE MUMMY was a promising tale of 1920s High Adventure – until the title character turned up, whereupon the movie descended into relentless CGI overkill. The sequel THE MUMMY RETURNS took everything that was wrong with the first film and multiplied it, and the result was a badly written, frantic CGI orgy with nothing to recommend it. Sommers followed it with another attempted revision of Universal's monsters, VAN HELSING, which despite some fine individual scenes and a few impressive sequences, was ultimately sunk by a truly appalling script and (unsurprisingly) an over-reliance on CGI.GI JOE is the first Sommers film in which the action scenes are all about military hardware and human conflict as opposed to monsters and fantasy-based concepts, and this initially appears to have made him re-think his approach. The opening sequence, in which an armoured NATO convoy is taken apart by ambushers equipped with high-tech VTOL aircraft, advanced body armour and energy pulse weaponry, has an edge that was lacking from his previous movies. However, it can't last and later sequences desperately needed someone to keep Sommers reined in. Yes, the centrepiece car chase through Paris is genuinely exciting, and if shot 'old school' like RONIN and the BOURNE movies, it could have been truly spectacular. But Sommers can't resist reverting to type and including unnecessary CGI elements, such as a motorbike-riding Scarlet and two pursuers in 'Accelerator Suits'. The latter gizmos are extremely silly, make little narrative sense (why do the JOEs use them unadvisedly in a public place full of civilians but not elsewhere in the film, in situations where they'd be more suitable?) and they belong in a superhero movie, not a spy/action film. Perhaps Sommers is keen to direct Marvel's planned AVENGERS movie, and is using the Paris sequence as his audition tape.Interestingly, while the GI JOE team in the original toy line, cartoon series and comic books was an all-American affair, it's a multi-national organisation in the movie. I suspect this is purely because the studio understandably wants the film to do well across the world, and most overseas audiences would view a film about American military triumphism as extremely distasteful, following the Bush administration's - ahem - 'liberation' of Iraq. Unfortunately, the main JOEs are a particularly colourless and clichéd bunch: there's The One With The Supposedly Tragic Past Who Broods a Lot, The One Who's Good With Tech Stuff, The One Who's Big and Strong, The One Who's Female, The One Who's Supposed To Be Funny, and The Gimp (speaking of which, as a newbie to the GI JOE mythos I thought Snake Eyes was very out-of-place, if only because it's never explained why he permanently walks around in head-to-toe rubber instead of combat fatigues like everybody else). The JOEs' blandness can be gauged by the fact that the only one to make an impression is Marlon Wayans, despite the fact that he's just reprising his comic relief character from the first DUNGEONS & DRAGONS movie.However, if the heroes are unmemorable, the same can't be said about the villains. GI JOE's poster ad-line was 'Evil Has Never Looked So Good', and the film delivers when it comes to that particular description. We're used to seeing bad guys in action movies who are barely competent, being out-thought and out-fought by the heroes throughout. Not this time. The Neo-Viper henchmen may be the usual cannon folder, but Storm Shadow and the Baroness are both extremely efficient and highly formidable, and repeatedly run rings around the JOEs for most of the movie's running time. Sienna Miller could have let her skin-tight leathers do the acting for her, but instead she gives a well-judged, understated and nicely nuanced performance, and she completely steals the film. There's not many action movies in which you find yourselves rooting for the bad guys, but with GI JOE you can, and not feel even the slightest bit guilty.The film falters towards the end, with too many soap opera-style revelations and cumbersome scenes that exist purely to set up a sequel. But on the positive side, while Sommers' previous movies were riddled with ludicrous plot holes and logic-gaps, GI JOE fortunately only contains a couple - the most glaring being when Ripcord thinks aloud about who he believes is ultimately responsible for the theft of the film's MacGuffin, and everybody immediately decides he's right, despite the fact there's no evidence to support his theory. Such annoyances aside, it's still the best film that Sommers has made so far, though admittedly that's not saying much.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
148,JokerMichel,Terrible,2,12 May 2018,"Even though I didn't have high expectations on this movie , it still managed to disappoint me
I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
149,cordaro9418,A Real American Hero....,6,2 September 2009,"""G.I.Joe is the codename for America's highly trained special mission force. It's purpose: To defend human freedom against Cobra, a ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world."" From the phenomenal release of the 3 3/4 inch toy line, the groundbreaking cartoon and even the Marvel Comics version, this basic principle has always rung true. 'GIJOE: The Rise of Cobra' stays true to that, no question.While JOE makes a very vibrant and well paced action flick and popcorn movie, it fails in supporting what producers may have seen as a rather thin cannon that the die-hard 80's fans will know by heart. For those of you who don't know or really didn't care... here it is. The GIJoe cartoon was the mainstream outlet while the comic book served as filler / fodder depending on how you viewed it. The comics obviously needed to add more human interest to the background and swerved way to the left where the cartoon would stay on its course of animated violence with a PSA and all is resolved by the end of the half hour episode. The big screen versions of 'Transformers' suffers from the same story problems, but easily overcame it because they're big robots and that's that. Though to the producers the background stories of the cartoons/comics may be fairly pointless (they took comic over cartoon because of the more realistic Cobra aspect) when launching a franchise and raking in millions upon millions of dollars (just ask Trekkies how much they love when the story veers from the cannon) it still means a little something to that small demographic of the audience who grew up with it. Certain characters worked seamlessly in transition, Destro being one and surprisingly Cobra Commander being another. Other characters endured minor tweaks while some simply had their backgrounds twisted into some useless silly sweet simple to follow everyday follies while others were changed completely inside out (if you're familiar with 'Ripcord' you know what I mean and 'Sgt. Slaughter' or 'Stalker' (or Stone as listed in the IMDb and played by Brendan Fasier) in the film renamed 'Flint' would have been perfect)... and sorry, but Duke was seriously miscast. Too bad considering you could have actually used the cannon background, re-arranged two or three scenes, a character name or two and have a movie approximately seven minutes longer but a lot more involving to the die-hard fan. Overall, this film does what it should. It takes you on the summer blockbuster journey through good versus evil (making cute fun of itself and the source material in the process) with some really great and imaginative locales and explosions delivering you neatly to the end of the ride where it at least appears that the good guys won... but they didn't. Kudos for that and for setting up what could be a great franchise. Story wise, and again only for the diehards (if you've never seen G.I.Joe or don't know anything of it outside of a little toy with kung-fu grip, you're safe) it's a tainted premise but obviously we'll muddle through. Popcorn movie epic and no bathroom breaks.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
150,jakerocks,Terrible casting,1,31 July 2021,Why did they use so many well known actors for these iconic GI Joe characters? Get unknowns who actually look and act the part.

151,EchoMaRinE,a pop-corn movie that you would watch and forget,7,1 May 2010,"I think I was expecting too much since G.I. Joe was my favorite when I was a kid. Long gone memories but yet fresh enough to judge the quality of this movie. This is certainly a pop-corn movie that you would watch and forget. Does it need to be that way, that I doubt. Recent CGI packed action movies are falling into the same trap. Somehow they manage to make the plot so cheesy that the movie turns into a crappy pop-corn flick. Transformers, 2012 and this one in particular had such a great potential, they had a fairly good budget and a big group of fan but the result is plain disappointment. Let me tell you why. First and most importantly, you really don't need to put a doll like woman in the plot. Really, I am sick of this great hero, saving the day and getting the woman scenario. Second, don't make silly jokes. It is distracting and reducing the quality of the movie. OK, coming back to Rise of Cobra, the acting is poor, directing is plain bad, plot is non-existing and CGI is border. If you want a high-volume pop-corn movie, go ahead but if you are G.I.

152,Jetset971,I saw what they were trying to do. Too bad if didn't work.,4,21 December 2010,"I thought long and hard about how I wanted to approach writing a review of this movie. I could blame it all on the producers or the director or the writers or even the actors. To be fair, I am going to have to evenly disperse the blame factor equally to all. THE PLOT: The process of setting up who and how GI Joe and Cobra are and how they got started is just a jumbled mess. Its so all over the place that you feel like they are not explaining enough and just making it to convenient. Like we should just accept this and move on. Fine, but how about developing this in a more cohesive fashion. I really felt insulted by the gimmicks presented here. UNESSACARY TANGENTS. Ugh. The whole sequence with the origin of ""Snake eyes"" was just tacked on. This too was rushed and would have served better in a sequel. THE ACTING. The biggest star in this movie was Dennis Quaid. Mr. Sellout himself. Man he has been doing so many sub-par movies over the years that I think he has done irrevocable harm to his career. He brings absolutely nothing to the table here. Not that they give him much to work with. The rest of the actors are completely forgettable and that ""Wayans"" actor, I cant remember his first name I just know he is the weakest actor of that family, just gets annoying after awhile. SPECIAL EFFECTS. Fair at best. A few good shots but mostly not worth it. it. OVERALL. The whole movie just doesn't work. They fall into the classic trap of thinking that just because this is based off a pop culture Icon that it should be able to float no matter what. WRONG! This movie collapsed from beginning to end. Could they have salvaged it? Only if they had scraped this whole direction and started from scratch. If you like GI JOE. Go watch the series.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
153,blackmambamark,"Boring story, horrible dialogue.....pieced together with terrible acting.",6,9 August 2009,"Congrats! If you were the creator of any form of cartoon in the 80's, you will probably get a phone call from Hollywood in a few months. Seems like they are just trying their dearest to capitalize on the Y generation. But G.I Joe? Really? I must be honest, i remember watching the cartoon as a kid, and thinking that it wasn't that cool.....it was just a road bump before X-Men came on.....but maybe they can bring it around to something better, and possibly save the 09' summer blockbuster series. OK, the first thing that i must talk about is the acting......it was down right terrible.......that is easily some of the worst acting i have seen in a long while. Up until this point, i have never seen a movie staring Channing Tatum, so i have never seen his acting ability.....and i honestly never want to again. But he wasn't quiet the tip of the iceberg.....you then have Marlon Wayans.....im sorry, but when i think of the term 'Real American Hero's'...he really doesn't come to mind. Especially in this movie, because you can tell he was there for the comic relief, and he provided the dullest jokes in the book. Dennis Quaid, a premiere actor in the 80's, and has done great work in the past, was also terrible in this. But the one that took the cake was easily the lead female......every time she came on screen, i had to look away, because her acting was just so terrible. I admit, i cannot act to save my life, but i could easily have out acted this broad. So combine this dame with Channing Tatum.....and you have an atom bomb of the worst acting duo you have ever seen. Now acting isn't everything.....right? You gotta have a decent story, one that can still keep the audience interest despite the horrid acting. Well.......they didn't really have a good one either. It was so un-interesting, and was pieced together with some of the worst dialogue. I thought ""Transformers"" had some pretty bad lines.....but this one is hands down the winner in that face-off. This movie pretty much did the same exact thing that ""Transformers 2"" did......it had 20% story, and 80% action........now don't get me wrong, in some cases, that can be a good thing, i mean after all.......this is a movie based on a cartoon right..........but in this case it was not. A boring storyline, worked with horrible acting, and pieced together with pathetic dialogue. Bottom Line......this movie looked horrible from the outside, and sure enough, its the same thing on the inside. Its filled with Cliché' after Cliché'......creates a story that doesn't really grab you, and does nothing but try to WOW you with its special effects.......which are probably the only good thing in this movie. But now that the summer blockbusters are coming to a close, i would like to say one thing......is it possible to bring back the old summer blockbusters? You know, the ones that actually had a little brains with its story......i mean look at the movie ""Speed""......basic storyline right? But it was adrenaline filled, and had a good enough plot to keep you one your toes. Probably something the director should have thought about before making this film.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

I used to watch the 80's cartoon, had my own figure (I think it was Tunnel Rat) and I do take a glimpse of the new ones once in a while. The cartoon was ridiculous and taking at least 1% of the cartoon into the movie would make it look incredibly weird. The movie draws from the cartoon and comic book very strongly (when you see the weapons and equipment that Cobra uses you'll know) and managed to keep itself together.I heard that the director of this film made The Mummy and Van Helsing. It is apparent because this film has a very unusual sort of violence and constant comedy, with Marlon Wayans providing most of the relief (Wayans was actually a good choice). All together its a cocktail of war films, James Bond, Power Rangers and Star Wars.Its for kids and for adults. Kids will enjoy the action, the story and its cartoon like appeal. Adults will enjoy the strong violence and the film does have moments in adult territory.And pretty much there is no big disappointment. It shed its Real American Hero roots but you will still get the same characters in their specialties doing their thing.This isn't an Oscar film. Its story, acting and special effects do not qualify in any sort of way. This will get bashed by the snooty ass critics.

156,changmoh,Crazy Adrenaline-Spiked Action All The Way!,7,5 August 2009,"After the Transformers, it's G.I. Joe for more crazy summer action. Like Transformers, G.I. Joe (or Action Force) was also a brand of Hasbro toys featuring all kinds of combat figures and high-tech vehicles that fire a young boy's imagination. At the height of its popularity in the 1980s, the Action Force brand spawned a cartoon series, a Marvel comic and even an animated movie before fading away in the early 1990s. Now it is set to rival Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen at the box-office. I am not well acquainted with Action Force toys but I was totally immersed in the action right after the opening flashback. For those who have played with G.I. Joe toys as kids, this is definitely the chance to relive their wildest action fantasies... The Plot: MARS Corporation, led by the dastardly James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), has developed a 'nanomite' bomb that contains greenish particles capable of 'eating' metal and demolishing structures and vehicles in seconds. You can imagine that anyone who has the nanomite bomb will be able to control the world - which is what McCullen is trying to do with a secret organisation known as Cobra. Sent out to get the bomb are the Baroness (Sienna Miller) and Storm Shadow (Lee Byung-hun) and trying to stop them are the elite G.I. Joe team led by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Leading members of the Joes team are Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Breaker (Saïd Taghmaoui). They are later joined by US Special Forces members, Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) who provide the movie with its love story, romantic interests and comic relief, not to mention fast-paced action and thrills. The Review: Indeed, director Stephen Sommers and his scripters (Stuart Beattie, David Elliot and Paul Lovett) seem obsessed with wanting to throw in everything from James Bond-type action, villains, underwater sets and romance to Star Wars battles, weapons and awe-inspiring gadgets. Sommers spares no expense in getting the stunts and scenes he wants and most of them are 'real cool'. Still, he takes time to provide the 'backgrounds' of the major characters, albeit in flashbacks so that they do not 'clash' with the main action and storyflow.In the Transformers movies, the battle sequences are often blurred and confusing when we have trouble differentiating the good and bad robots. There is no such problem here. The chases and fight/stunt sequences are so spectacular and breath-taking - one of the most mind-boggling action pieces I have seen this summer. This especially applies to the Paris street chase sequence which has the Joes in accelerator suits hot on the heels of the Baroness in a reinforced Hummer.Usually in action movies like this, performances take a back seat. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the chemistry between Tatum and Miller, and between Wayans and Nichols. Yeah, in the midst of all that zapping, clashing and crashing, Sommers wants us to know that 'the heart still goes on'. And of course, he ends with an intriguing narrative hook - provided by a subplot involving Zartan (played by Arnold Vosloo). It has its flaws but this is an adrenaline-spiked 'Government-Issue' fun ride from start to end. - By Lim Chang Moh",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Everybody seems to have the same argument when they trash this film.. ""it's all effects and no brains or dramatic undertones"". OK, that is true, I've got to admit, but then again what kind of movie were these people actually expecting to see? Huh?! G.I. Joe is as pure as an action film can possibly be and most importantly, it doesn't pretend to be anything else. Look at the poster. Check out the trailer. After those, were you perhaps waiting to see an Ingmar Bergman film? IT'S G.I. JOE, for Christ's sake! And I must say that in it's category, it isn't that bad. Sommers can direct good action sequences (the pursuit on the streets of Paris is stunning!) and although the film is obviously overblown with ridiculous gadgets and over the top plot lines, it doesn't matter because Joe succeeds in it's ONLY primary mission: to be entertaining. It's never boring and it's the silly fun it was always going to be.So in a nutshell.. if you want a serious film to watch, check out There Will Be Blood or Doubt, but if you just want to forget for two hours the mess your leaders have left your nation, nay, the *world* and just have fun, check out this action film.

We had CGI like that already in our heads. At first I was pulled out by the obvious military ad, then I got suckered in by sheer childish nostalgia.It works. The vehicle's design have that toyish quality, great designs. Camera work is remarkable too, making the movie much less chaotic in action scenes than, say, Transformers. It is really action-packed from one end to the other, and all of this numbs the mature critic to let the child step in, somehow.Furthermore, there is a pair of ladies in there that might pass as normal to a kid but that will make sure that daddy watches with interest, too. That Scarlet chick, Rachel Nichols, is quite a feast for the eyes, and classy Sienna Miller also looks real good as a brunette, and acts with a lighter touch, too.This film is a guilty pleasure; Rationality isn't required here, and certainly won't help; I suggest you leave it at the door, and indulge the kid in you.",G.I.

Great concept, cast and budget: hey, let's bury it all under a huge pile of annoying special effects. People from Hollywood: I (and all the other movie maniacs) have already seen every possible special there is. Its not exciting anymore! would you please take your feet off the gas pedal?!! thank you.I gave it 5 points because yes, there are a few good lines and its still fun to watch (but only once, unlike some really good movies). So there you go. Watch it if you must. G.I.Joe is the reason I won't go watch Avatar. I'm tired! Please spare me!!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
161,theycallmemrglass,A surprisingly very fun big movie.,7,2 January 2010,"I too, like so many others went into this movie with not just low expectations but with a paranoid fear of not being able to make a quick escape to the exit door having been planted bang in the middle of the cinema auditorium. The trailer suggested this was going to be a loud, overly camp comic book movie in the vein of the terrible Fantastic Four.So it is with shock that I enjoyed this movie to very giddy height. It isn't classic, far far from it but it is a film full of fun, action and humour much like Serenity and dare I say it, Star Wars. In fact there is blatant (somewhat crass, I admit) mirroring of the Star Wars, A new hope structure, including an army of Darth Vader look alike to boot. There is absolutely nothing original but I still couldn't help enjoying it.Its just a fun summer movie. That's all it wants to be but its a good one.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
162,Naughtia_Nah,Had no expectations and loved it,7,28 August 2011,"This movie has a lot of famous faces and the plot was quite good. I must add that I've never been a fan of the G.I. Joe concept/toys when I was a kid, but I remember all my male friends back then had a lot of these toys. Also I've never known the story behind the concept, I just know about the toys.So one can say that I had no expectations when I started watching this movie. I guess that's why I didn't get disappointed, I guess I liked it very much because of all the neat special effects (I'm a sucker for good special effects) and I was fond of the concept. All in all this is a good movie with a lot of action entertainment.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
163,LadyLiberty,GI Joe Succeeds in its Movie Mission,8,8 August 2009,"I first saw previews for GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra a couple of months ago. As the trailer unfolded on screen, I found myself getting more and more excited. What was this awesome movie that I was so absolutely going to see? Then I saw the big title appear: GI Joe. How embarrassing. A few weeks later, I saw the previews again, and was sucked in again. I even admitted to a few discreet friends that I just might have to go see it (yes, they laughed). Well, now I've seen it and I'm going public with that fact as well as my reaction: I loved it, and I'm not ashamed to say so! I don't know anything about GI Joe the doll—I'm sorry, the ""action figure""—nor am I familiar with the comics. In fact, I didn't even know that there were GI Joe comics. So I came into the theatre with a group of friends and no expectations or foreknowledge.Duke (Channing Tatum) is an American soldier whose team is tasked with guarding some very nasty warheads developed by the MARS corporation. Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) is his friend and fellow team member. Despite the team's impressive firepower and expertise, a group headed up by the Baroness (Sienna Miller) ambushes them. The technology of the attackers is off the scale, and Duke and Ripcord find themselves fighting for their lives in what appears to be a losing proposition. At the last minute, another team joins the fray and they, too, boast some very high tech weaponry. Fortunately, they're the good guys.Such is Duke and Ripcord's introduction to GI JOE, a special black ops team headed up by General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Their determination to avenge their team sees the men fighting along side such GI JOE luminaries as Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) against baddies like Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee), ""the doctor"" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the mysterious Zartan (Arnold Vosloo), and their very wealthy, very powerful supporters including the man behind the weapons genius of MARS, McCullen (Christopher Eccleston).The stories and back stories being told are surprisingly intricate, yet even with no prior knowledge of the characters or setting, I had no problem following everything. But let's be honest here: the story isn't why you go to see a movie like this. It's the action, the explosions, the special effects that draw you in, and GI Joe has 'em all in spades. The effects are fantastic and the action is almost non-stop. Frankly, the story could have been simpler and the movie still pretty good; the fact that the script doesn't let us down is a real and welcome bonus. Simplistic? Yeah, in many ways it is. Simple? Not even close.With a movie like this, acting ability is almost superfluous. Muscles and stunts are what it's all about. There is actually some decent acting in GI Joe (most notably from Sienna Miller and Christopher Eccleston), though some performers don't measure up in that regard. But that's okay, because the muscles and stunts are there; the fight scenes are intricately choreographed and well executed; and the CGI is both effective and, at times, jaw-dropping. Oh, and where low tech but nice surprises are concerned, keep your eyes open for a nice cameo from an actor we've seen in one or two other action flicks.BOTTOM LINE: I had a ball. The friends I was with (three guys in their early 20's) had fun, too. If you're more into serious dramas or sophisticated comedies, stay away from this one. But if you like action, special effects, and pure movie entertainment, go ahead and put GI Joe on your movie-going itinerary. By the way, GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra positively screams, ""Sequel! Sequel!"" I'll tell you right now that, based on the first movie, I'll be buying a ticket for any follow-up they care to make.FAMILY SUITABILITY: GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra is rated PG-13, which is fairly appropriate. The violence is almost non-stop and is, at times, fairly graphic. While there's no sex, and profanity is sparse and mild when it occurs, the overall film is quite intense, too much so for little ones. That being said, I suspect most little boys (older than, say, 7 or 8) will have no problem seeing GI Joe and will probably like it quite a bit. Most little girls likely won't like it at all.POLITICAL NOTES: One world government? That's a problem for me, and apparently a problem for GI Joe as well. In the movies, the ultimate goal of the bad guys is supposed to horrify us and make us want them to fail. What do the bad guys in GI Joe want? A one world government. That's not a bad message to send, especially given the proclivities of some in this country to institute just that.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
164,H_Spengler,"Big dumb fun is ""OK""",4,7 August 2009,"This certainly isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, but it's far from the best. If you go into it with an open mind just wanting to be entertained and not expecting anything cerebral, than you'll likely be amused.The Good: Ray Park as Snake Eyes. Ray Park never disappoints. His martial arts style and amazing flexibility shine through here too. I was pleased.Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Probably the best performance of anyone in the movie (right up there with Park.) I was very impressed with his portrayal of the half mad genius doctor. He captured the atmosphere of the character dead on. You'll enjoy him every second he's on screen.A lot of the POV shots are very cool (esp the ""Joe plane""). The attention to detail in most parts of the film is really very good. Particularly the shot of the city ""grid"" below when a complicated sky shot is occurring. Even if it is CGI, it's done very well, and doesn't look fake. The traffic action sequences are nicely done, as are the destruction of the ""metal objects"" of different heights and lengths. I also enjoyed the transitions from scene to scene, esp. during battles. (Matching what the plane was doing, and then morphing to the submarine in a similar position was pretty cool.) Your all around performances by the rest of the cast really aren't too bad, but at the same time isn't anything remarkable either. The Bad:If you're expecting any character development....don't, there really isn't any. A few characters have a few brief flashbacks to establish quick parts of their lives, but it really isn't anything substantial or particularly revealing.Don't expect anything special from the dialog either, it's not deep, and most of the time not really particularly interesting. It's not necessarily monotone as much as it is flat and consistent. Few characters ever seem to be astonished or overwhelmed by the situations/battles/action sequences they've found themselves in. I'm willing to believe this is a casualty of acting in front of green screen with mega effects and explosions added post production, or just lazy script writing and the failure of the director to envision what will eventually be added and directing his actors to feel it.The movie is laughable unintentionally in certain parts, mostly thanks to cornball dialog and occasional over the top acting.A few nit-picky items I had with the movie: Why is it all the women have this long hair all over the place all the time, even in the heat of battle? Seems to me a ponytail could at least have been utilized, instead super model hair abounds! Oh well.Could we make the Cobra Commander a cooler mask? In the cartoon he had this faceless mask that you never saw through. It was simple, and yet effective in it's design. I got all excited in this movie when the doctor finally donned his commander mask, only to have it look like something you'd use around your house when doing projects, covered in something cheap looking & shiny, with large, clear, plastic eye-holes. If Gordon-Levitt could pull a performance that surpassed expectations, than surely the effects department could whip him up a mask to match.Like I said, not a bad movie if you have no expectations and can enjoy big dumb fun, but nothing too cerebral. 4/10P.S. - Watch for a ""blink and you'll miss it"" cameo by Brendan Fraser.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
165,NutzieFagin,Come on People It wasn't that bad...,7,28 August 2009,"At first I was ashamed to see this movie. I am a grown woman in my forties. On the day of the movie, I was having my car serviced and needed some time to kill, so I walked over to the local movie theatre. Scanning my choices, I was craving for a movie with a LOT of NOISY action...nothing quiet...no big social issues or thoughts. G.I Joe seemed the obvious choice. Muttering under my breath, ""I can't believe I am seeing a kiddie flick"" I paid the ticket and entered.Yep! In the theatre itself, i got my wish for noise and action. I was surrounded by 15 screaming 11 yr olds. Dad was trying to quiet them down..and luckily they shooshed by the time the picture started. When I saw within the credits that Hasbro was one of the main producers, I only rolled my eyes backward and sighed. Many memories of picking up the G.I toys off the floor.So with this scenario I was throughly prepared to just go to sleep during a bad movie in an air conditioned theatre. But I hate to admit it....The movie kept my interest. a LOT of non stop action scenes, the plot was simple bad guy/ good guy fight saving the world etc. but in overall, I was entertained. Remember People--the characters in the movie are from a TOY and comic book manufactors. It was just a good summer movie to beat the heat. I don't know why some people are looking at this movie like the Academy Awards Favorite scenes? Love the action suits for the running scenes in Paris. However, these suits make the enabler to run as fast as they can--no strain on the body or heart? And I never understood in most kung fu and fight scenes in movies, that NO ONE gets seriously hurt or breaks a bone. Oh Well, that's show biz! And saving the city of Paris? They must have killed off scores of people in traffic accidents on the streets---where are the French police? The fight scene between Snake Eyes and his ""brother"" was good but the black and white costumes made me think of the Star Wars scene between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. I could hear ""Luke, I am your father"" vaguely.Even with the contrived plot, ""Go Joe"" shouts...Hip Hip Hurrah...I was entertained and I can see a sequel may be in the making...Maybe if the car needs repair again, I'll be there.But truth in advertising...Need a movie..lots of noisy action...sorta simple plot great scenes...I'd say ""Go Joe!""",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
166,alanrayford,Agressively and Bombastically Mediocre,5,29 December 2009,"Why was this movie made? Who the hell was it made for? Did anyone notice how it was shaping up before it was shipped out to the masses? These are all questions I have about G.I. Joe: the Rise of Cobra.This property only saw success in the early to late eighties with generation X—my generation. I remember racing home from elementary school to watch it and then talking about in class the next day. But, by the time I was twelve, the show had become a joke and I couldn't bring myself to watch another episode.When I heard this movie was being made, I was still curious. The more I heard about it, the more my curiosity grew. My hopes probably should've been set lowersomewhere around the heel of my foot.I won't mention the acting, because nobody watches a movie like this in hopes of seeing an Oscar winning performance. I won't complain about the casting, because I've long ago accepted that Hollywood has its head up its arse when it comes to filling roles in summer flicks (check out 2003's the Hulk, Superman Returns, Transformers 1 and 2, or the Fantastic Four movies). But I will take exception with the writing and directing.TROC did nothing to rectify the problems that plagued the cartoon. The good guys still win in the face of insurmountable odds. The bad guys still lose in the face of insurmountable odds. The technology both sides employ is echelons beyond bleeding edge tech, but is taken for granted and never explained. Cobra has an improbably complex H.Q. which couldn't have possibly been built without anyone noticing (via satellite)—yet no one did.The action scenes were even more far-fetched than the cartoon's. The accelerator suits used in the Paris chase begged the question why everyone didn't have one. Snake eyes jumping around the top of a SUV felt like an unused clip from a Spiderman movie. The undersea battle at the end of the film was too over the top to follow. I realize the dogfight was taking place under water. But, no matter how advanced, a submarine isn't going to handle like a plane. Watching Duke bob and weave a submersible through the waters of the Artic like something out of Iron Eagle was not only absurdit was confusing. The fight between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow was underwhelming and felt like it'd been ripped out of the Phantom Menace, complete with a beaten SS plummeting down a large shaft to his seeming demise.The one thing the 80's cartoon had going for it was the character designs. This was the single aspect of the show which, arguably, didn't need to be changed. Everyone looked like an extension of their personalities. How ironic that this is one of the only two things which was altered. Not one character jumped off the screen—not even Snake Eyes. Duke, Ripcord, Scarlett, Heavy Duty, Breaker, and General Hawk all felt flat. On the villainous front, Destro didn't sport his trademark look until the very end of the film; Cobra Commander looked more like a subordinate than THE bad guy; Storm Shadow looked more like a gigolo than a highly skilled ninja assassin; and the BaronessWTF.A large part of the Baroness' appeal was that she was, through and through, a bad guy. There was no conflict. There was no remorse. She wore tight leather, did bad things, and would laugh like a maniac about it. Here they made her the victim of brainwashing so that Duke could have a kinda' love interest—it's like adding one and one to come up with eleven.All in all, I can't fathom why this movie was ever greenlit. The only rationale which springs to mind is that it was a blatant cash run. I just hope the inevitable sequel scales thing back to make the entire premise more in line with the real world—after all this isn't Transformers.To do this, all that has to be done is to scale back the budget. Make the Joe team smaller, put greater emphasis on their specialties, and make them more visually distinctive. Take away their super-duper, crazy tech, leaving them to use the standard issue armaments the military does. After all, an M-16 is going to do way more damage in the hands of an elite commando than in the hands of a grunt fresh out of basic. Have the set pieces be more in line with the planet Earth and less like something that would stupefy Luke Skywalker. As for the bad guys, leave them just big enough to pose a genuine threat to the world, have a definite edge over the Joe team, and not an inch bigger.Until these changes are made (assuming they ever would be), to any fans of the 80's show, I say check out G.I. Joe: Resolute. This animated feature is a more realistic, mature, and intriguing take on the franchise that TROC should have been, but was not.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
167,johnslegers,Moronic two hour toy commercial,4,15 May 2010,"As I just finished watching ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"", I seriously wonder what kind of abomination the Hollywood film industry has become when its major blockbusters are reduced to two hour long toy commercials filled with fancy CGI but lacking a coherent story whatsoever.Any man born in the early eighties somewhere in Western society remembers GI Joe as one of the coolest toy franchises that (just like ""Transformers"") had its own cartoon series to make the toys notorious. And boy, notorious they were. Millions of young boys dreamed of having their own plastic Cobra army going against the brave plastic Joe's and of course (unlike the cartoon) defeating them every now and then. I don't remember much of the cartoon series, to be honest, but boy do I remember those fascinating Cobra outfits. Those were the days...Now we're 20 years later and the toy companies have moved up. Instead of using cartoons to sell their toys, they're using movies. And boy, do they suck. ""Transformers"" was an empty shell of a film, ""Transformers 2"" managed to be even worse and then there was ""GI Joe"". All I can say is ""WOW""... What a way to ruin our childhood memories.""GI Joe"" consists of little more than one action scene after the other. While this is not a bad thing per se (I actually liked ""Crank"" and even ""Shoot 'em up"" the first time I saw them), the audience of ""GI Joe"" witnesses its intelligence being consistently insulted by a story that lacks any character development whatsoever, that lacks a coherent plot, that defies physics on a continuous basis and that is so filled with CGI I sometimes felt I was watching an animation film. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but going throughout this film and remotely taking it seriously is another. Is there any more blatant way to rip off an existing franchise and use film as a way to advertise a new line of toys? And you know what... The one thing that made ""GI Joe"" so fascinating as a kid was the cool ""Cobra"" outfits and they managed to ruin that as well. ####, even the toys look like ####!Watch this film only if you want to get a glimpse of how ridiculously sub par Hollywood blockbusters have become and you feel like making fun of it. Even as a ""turn off your brain and enjoy"" kind of film, this film is just too moronic to watch in any other setting... unless you're as stupid as the lowest common denominators this film seems to be targeted for. In that case, I pity you.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
168,RyanEberhart,Pretty Good,8,5 September 2013,"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra stars (in no particular order) Channing Tatum, Dennis Quaid, Sienna Miller, Marlon Wayans, Rachel Nichols, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Jonathan Pryce and several others. Joseph Gordon Levitt plays Cobra Commander, although he doesn't reveal himself until the end as the mastermind behind the whole story of the movie. Cobra Commander played everyone off each other as best he could, but eventually was caught. Oops, I gave away the ending. Wait, if you have ever seen a G.I. Joe cartoon or read a comic book, then you should know that either Cobra Commander is caught or escapes. One of his lieutenants is usually caught as well.I do have many favorite scenes in this movie but what I like the most is the special effects. The plasma cannons are pretty good, and the way the editors slowed them down for full effect was pretty cool. The nanomite warheads taking out the Eiffel Tower was pretty awesome. The different weapons that each character used was pretty cool, like the suits that Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) war running across Paris to stop The Baroness (Sienna Miller) and Stormshadow (Byung-hun Lee). I also liked when Zartan (Arnold Vosloo) was injected with nanomites in order to change his face to look like the President (Jonathan Pryce).One of my favorite scenes is when The Baroness, Stormshadow and Zartan locate the G.I. Joe base and attack. They are there to steal the nanomite warheads for McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), who actually made them but wants them for himself. After a long fight The Baroness and Stormshadow escape successfully with the warheads.My next favorite, the best scene, is the chase scene through Paris. There is a lot going on in this scene. You have Snake Eyes (Ray Park) on top of or underneath the vehicle that The Baroness and Stormshadow are in. Duke and Ripcord are chasing after the same vehicle wearing suits that enhance their every move. Duke and Ripcord even jump over, or through as is the case for Ripcord, a train. The train incidentally flipped the vehicle in which The Baroness and Stormshadow are in. The scene culminates with Stormshadow firing one of the warheads at the Eiffel Tower. The nanomites eat half of the tower and many other metal objects before Duke is able to hit the kill switch.I am only going to describe two scenes this time, since I described some of the special effects and the weapons that were used by some of the characters.I give this an 8 out of 10 stars though, even though I liked the special effects. There just wasn't much of a story. The writers, director and producers tried to put in some of the back stories of many of the characters, but it just didn't work for me. If it wasn't for the special effects, and Rachel Nichols as Scarlett, the score would be lower. Rachel Nichols is hot, more so as a redhead. Just my opinion.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

170,lekgolah,Action packed entertainment fitted within a suitable running time,7,29 August 2010,"When I went to see G.I Joe, I had recently seen Transformers 2 a week before, which was terrible. Therefore my expectations had decreased significantly. Thankfully though I found this film to be non-stop action that was always entertaining to watch.It beats Transformers 2 in almost every area (sadly not in the CGI department); the action was enjoyable, the heroes were likable and had a clear goal they had to achieve, the story was simple and easy to follow, the villains carried a sense of danger, the jokes while not hilarious were good and the film had an appropriate running time therefore it never became dull.What is so enjoyable about this film is that it introduces the audience nicely into the world of G.I Joe and that the film is aware that people are watching this for lots of explosions and action and the film delivers. The story is established early on and then it is onto the action with helicopters being blasted to pieces while soldiers fire off hundreds of rounds at the enemy.Of course the film is silly and it does start to fall apart towards the end but for most of its running time, the film is fun. I do doubt though that the sequel will have the same luck as this one did because this is not a perfect film. The script may not be great but for anyone in search of an enjoyable action film, this is the film for you.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
171,Brownsbros3,"If you were a fan of the original series, you will hate this film.",3,19 August 2009,"I give the film three points based on the special effects, which were pretty good. As a fan of the original TV series (I never read the comics because no store in my neighborhood carried them), I was very disappointed in this film. While the Transformers movie stayed faithful to the original animated series, this movie took way too many creative liberties with the material. Some of these include, Duke is not a hick, the Baroness is supposed to be German, Destro is not Scottish, Duke and Cobra Commander were never friends, Duke was never involved romantically with the Baroness, Zartan had long hair, Heavy Duty and Ripcord were minor characters at best, Breaker is not French, the Baroness was never good, the Baroness and Cobra Commander are not brother and sister, and Scarlett was romantically linked to Duke, not Ripcord.Plus what is the deal with the casting? Channing Tatum sucked. They would have been better off with Brendan Fraser as Duke. They originally had listed him as Gung Ho, but given that he didn't shave his head and grow a goatee, I don't know who he was playing (Flint maybe?). He should have been in the whole movie, not just a brief cameo. I also thought Dwayne Johnson was supposed to be in the movie as Shipwreck. I would have much rather he be in the cast than Marlon Wayans. Speaking of which, how does Marlon keep getting work? He is a terrible actor, and regularly nominated for a Razzie Award. Other than Wayans and Dennis Quaid, this was largely a cast of unknowns, which tends to be the Hollywood blockbuster trend. And several key characters are missing like Flint, Lady Jaye, Shipwreck, Gung Ho, Roadblock, Dusty, and Wild Bill. The super suit idea was also missing the point. The G.I. Joe team was a different group of heroes. They used their own abilities to fight evil. They didn't need super powers.They set up for a sequel, but I would advise against it. And if they they do, I will probably wait for the DVD.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
172,Foobarman,Just an average action film,6,10 August 2009,"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is pretty much just a typical mediocre action movie. There isn't really much that is special about it at all. I still enjoyed it - but to really enjoy a movie it should be a bit unique and different.The action in this movie is not great but merely average - same as the plot. The plot is just the basic good vs evil teams and quite frankly it gets quite boring after a while.If this movie had a less typical plot and a more serious tone - then it would probably be quite a good movie and more enjoyable. Don't get me wrong - it's still a good movie and I'm sure many people enjoyed it - but it could have been better.That said, it's a good action movie for the family or friends and for those who like action movies then I recommend you see this movie.",G.I.

JOE exists purely for it's breathtaking action.Based upon the Hasbro toy line of the same name it was made after the huge success of TRANSFORMERS (another Hasbro Toy) along with its sequel.There isn't a lot I can tell you about it. as the plot is irrelevant.Directed by Stephen Sommers - The man responsible for THE MUMMY, THE MUMMY RETURNS & VAN HELSING - so if you've seen any of those you'll know what to expect, but on a even grander scale.$150M plus was spent here and every penny of it is on the screen in mostly tremendous Special FX.It had a troubled production and a ballooning budget, but it did well enough Internationally to warrant a sequel, currently in Pre-Production and scheduled for release sometime in 2012.G.I. JOE won't win any awards (apart from for it's FX that is) but as an pure Action Film, its probably the best ever made to date and so gets a 10/10 on the basis of quality.DON'T LOOK FOR FAULTS - JUST LEAVE YOUR BRAIN AT THE DOOR AND ENJOY!",G.I.

For every good movie that was released during them (District 9, Toy Story 3, Inception, Iron Man 2) we had a ton of awful movies that accompanied them. And G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra was one of the bad ones, yet not as bad as some of the others were. It is just flat-out stupid.G.I Joe: The Rise Of Cobra is about... well, it's about a team of soldiers trying to stop terrorist from unleashing ghost ooze against the world. The story is so stupid, that it is insulting to stupid movies to classify this as stupid. There is no beginning, there is no middle, and there is no end. It is just stuff blowing up with no rhyme or reason. Who is this Cobra, what is their ultimate goal, where are they getting this technology? If you are a fan of G.I Joe (Like myself), you may have the answers... but there is no way in hell anybody else will! Cause they never bloody explain anything!!How is the dialogue? Awful, bloody horrendously awful. The nonstop action cliché' moments are downright embarrassing, from lines such as ""You could do that?"" to ""Now you will die, without saying a word"" the dialogue makes you cringe, and all of this is poorly delivered as well. The acting here is as fake as the horrible special effects. Speaking of which, the action scenes downright rip off Michael Bay's Transformers movies.

Its got nothing on its mind at all, its $170 million worth of eye candy, same as last year, same as next year, if thats your bag, go, if its not, don't !",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
176,Jinn,G.I Blow,2,6 August 2009,"Was this a G.I. Joke? Yet another long awaited blockbuster - and about time for a comeback... And yet another, in the tradition if Michael Bay, a total let down :( ...Well let's start with the good ... Yes there was some. The effects and fight scenes were awesome, interesting storyline and history ... The History of Destro, Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, although Storm Shadow wasn't (or wasn't in the original episodes I saw, such a sadistic bastard), he had more of an enigma to him. I liked Snake Eyes, although he looked a but chunky. The History of Cobra Commander was interesting, but I can't see the Commander as the Baroness' Brother ... Again she's supposed to be German, and Cobra Commander was American... Another new live-action movie 'eff up...After Michael Bay's testosteronic let down of Transformers, I, to be honest, was not expecting GI Joe to be too true to the original, sadly.Now the new look was okay for me, even if Scarlett didn't have her trademark pony tail. I also missed the presence of Lady J. I liked Duke, Rip Cord and Hawk.Now most of the new stuff and different takes can be forgiven, but one thing that cannot be ...*Oh...My...God*... Baroness! What happened!? No offence to Americans (many of my friends are Americans), but the Baroness speaks with a thick European/Austrian accent and is *not* in love with Duke!! *Blecccch!!!*** That take made me sick! They turned this once proud Cobra operative into a lovesick, conscious wrestling bimbo! Yuck!!!*** ... She's ruthless, hates the Joes and is Cobra Commander's Second in Command! In the episodes (and comics) However she did have a tender side - which was very, very, very, very, very *rarely* shown. This movie was like a badly written piece of fan fiction -- and the fans write better ones.My guess is they wanted to make her character redeemable ... But it didn't work! It was the most off-putting thing about the movie. Good thing for the producers The Baroness is a fictitious character, or she'd shoot them or at the very least up-chuck her Stroganoff. Quote Hermione from 'Harry Potter & the Half Blood Prince: 'Excuse me, I have to go and vomit.' This was the one things that *sucked* totally in the Gi-Joe/Cobra movie. When I first heard Sienna Miller was cast, I had my doubts (seeing as she played that snobby bint Victoria in StarDust) ... However when I saw her with dark hair all decked in leather, I became impressed. She certainly looked the part (Better with the glasses darkened), but this whole American accent, in love with Duke and only turned evil due to the nanite robot infection was deplorable... Grrrr! While I watched the movie, I had to put on her real accent and repeat her lines to myself to make it less barf-able. Go here to learn of the *real* Baroness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_(G.I._Joe) I wish, like with X-Men they had had a fan at the helm (and the same with Transformers) - At least we'd have a decent story, characters looking and sounding right - and true to the original ***from what they are made***!!!!! Was it too much for them to write a bad-ass woman character without making her lovey-dovey, and not really evil? Yeech! (That'd be like Starscream joining the Autobots - or Ironhide joining the Decepticons... **So Not happening** (Now don't you go getting' ideas, Bay) ... Don't get me wrong, I like good guys but if the bad guys are bad -- ***Keep them that way!!!***The Baroness... Last seen with Megatron & Starscream, all drunk & high as a kite & reminiscing about the good 'ol days...",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
177,bharath-karthikeyan,Inadequate detail at some areas mirages an otherwise fun movie!,6,16 September 2009,"G.I.Joe the movie,just hearing this built up enough expectations in me to check out the movie as soon as it is to be out as I have been a great fan of G.I.Joe,both the toys and the cartoons(The Cobra Commander still lurks in my Computer Desk). Hence to be frank,it is actually a bit hard to come up with a story showcasing all the elements the G.I.Joe franchise holds in a movie.But the story this movie has is totally not new.The writers of the script could have come up with some other interesting storyline. Apart from the story the intense action and thrill elements in the movie is just great,there is snake eyes in one side with his martial art moves and Duke n Ripcord's accelerating suit tricks are really fun to watch. Steven Sommers' favorite's's from the mummy series can be seen in this movie with Brendan Fraser in a flash-and-he-is-gone role.The soundtrack failed to captivate and so did the acting skill of the actors(considering most of them wearing a mask or dark shades throughout the movie!). Some of the CGI shot look really captivating but a few others are just too cartoonish to accept it for real(according to the movie).A little more detail in this area would have helped. Overall the movie turned out to be just another action flick with more detail into action rather than the story.But as for me,am gonna wait till another G.I.Joe movie to come out,not just another movie with a G.I.Joe name with it,period!",G.I.

178,Chris_Mac_25,"Lost two stars for Wayans ""acting""",1,30 May 2020,"Was not expecting an academy award winning effort, just a big dumb action movie, and we nearly got there. But Marlon Wayans was cast as the comedic side kick and proceeded to act convincingly as the comedy challenged drop kick. His presence overshadowed every aspect of the movie, it's no wonder he's stuck churning out his own brand of low budget cringefest rubbish like Little Man",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
179,ticket_for_one,Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow,7,15 August 2009,"I found this to be a fun enjoyable action movie. But like some of the other summer blockbusters it wasn't perfect. In terms of action, it never lets up. The set pieces, as computer generated as they are, are really good. Although I found some of the special effects in some of the scenes rather choppy...but they can be easily overlooked. It delivers on action, but not on story which was pretty basic really. A group of soldiers team up to save the world against an evil group of terrorists and one soldier, gets the girl at the end of it all. That's it! Stephen Sommers is not the kind of director whose interested in plot as much as he is action. So this he's given us another special effects laden movie, with no story. Performance wise, Sienna Miller as Baroness was great, Marlon Wayans was annoying and funny at the same time and Joseph Gordon Levitt also did a good job with his character Cobra Commander. I can't say the same for some of the others. Channing Tatum continues where he left off with Fighting, he was truly awful, as was Chris Ecclestone who struggled with his Scottish accent throughout the entire film. Best thing about this movie is Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, who have this Streetfighter, Ken and Ryu rivalry between them. Every time they fought on screen it was great and in my opinion those two were the best thing about this movie. Even the fight scenes they had in their flashbacks were great. All in all, G.I Joe is a good old fashioned summer blockbuster, much better than Transformers 2 and Wolverine.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
180,John K.-2,"Non-stop cliché-filled action: great gadgets, no brains",6,7 August 2009,"First, the bad news: Think of the action scenes in every James Bond film you've ever seen (except the sex -- this film is aimed at a young audience). Add in anything you remember from Top Gun or Iron Man. Well, it's all here -- every action film cliché. Worldwide locations? High-tech gadgets? Fast vehicles on land, sea and air? Fights with all kinds of weapons, or none? They're all here.Some key plot elements get a scene or two to develop them, but many others just get a single expository line from one of the main characters -- there's just no time to develop them, even though it sometimes comes across as comically bad scriptwriting.As for realism, the filmmakers didn't watch enough Star Trek episodes to know that you cannae change the laws of physics. Plus computers with incredibly simple user interfaces can issues incredibly complex commands, and incredibly complex computerised control panels can be understood by 'science boffins' after seeing them for about two seconds. And if I gave you a list of questions of the form ""If they had the technology to do this, then why didn't they do that?"", it would fill the page.Now the good news: The action never stops for more than a couple of minutes. The gadgets would be great fun to use if they were real. The main characters in the cast are all incredibly fit (in both senses of the word). The main action sequences are good, though not outstanding enough to compete with the likes of the Matrix Revisited. The CGI explosions/disasters are well done.Summary: If you are happy to switch off your reality detector, and imagine yourself as the heroic knight/feisty damsel saving the world while having fun using these gadgets, you should love this film. But if you're looking for emotional depth, you'll find more in a rain puddle.See it if you like action films, or if you were a fan of the TV show Gladiators/American Gladiators ... one of the actors is a dead ringer for one of the original British Gladiators, and there's even a scene in the film that pays homage to Gladiators. And Gladiators has a lot in common with this film -- there's supposed to be a plot, but all the fun is in watching fit people fight.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
181,mokshjuneja,Yo Joe! Go G.I. Joe!,7,21 August 2009,"What you should be going for in the movie - G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is the total mindless actions pack chase sequences, this is something I loved in the movie.1. there is whole dodging highly explosive missiles with somersaults like the sequence in Transformers.2. I love the scene two men (Rip Cord and Duke) in heavy armored suits are actually running across the streets of France and with smoothness and complete agility to save the city. In the same chase, there was Scarlet who had super-human skills of rising bike, specially for a girl, you need to watch this to believe it.This was somewhat better than the Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, cause at least this movie did not randomly bring robots or characters, with out giving them introduction. Even the way flashback is created for each character, not necessarily for all of them is actually a good way of introducing the G.I. characters.I liked the character Rip Cord the most because he was a comic relief. Snake Eyes looks more black than white in the character, was it because of the costume. Anyway, true identity was never revealed neither you could, but he was never so muscular. Now, what i missed in the movie, and love to see, if the plan a sequel, prequel, postquel and what ever they G.I's want to call it, are the They need to shout ""Yo Joe"" at least 10-15 times in the movie. You need to bring in more characters from the G.I. Team is Dusty, Short-Fuse (he was also a comic relief in the TV series), Ghung- Ho, Shipwreak and Cobra team is Suit dressed Tomax and Xamot.You need to show how Zartan is scared of the sun and what you missed out in the movie was that Zartan is actually a master of disguise and you missed that out, hope you give Aronld Vosloo enough space in the movie. He is favourite since the Mummy days. Brenden Fraiser was a complete surprise to be seen in the movie.Dennis Quiad as General Hawk was too docile and not authoritative enough. The last movie that comes to my mind with Dennis Quaid is Vantage Point, in that movie you had Said who was the enemy in the movie and now he is the accomplice in this movie. Welcome to the movie world.The movie with the G.I. Joe mission and purpose: to defend human freedom against Cobra, a ruthless terrorist organization determined to rule the world.The movie also misses the the theme song of TV series at least should make one peppy one. What about the public service announcements that were made at the end of each show. Last fight scene would be Destro running away, saying that, we will get you next time.Please! Please! get all these elements in the next G.I. Joe movie.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
182,blackberrybabe,Not bad for a romantic,6,9 October 2009,"This movie is not my type. I like romances, not action films. That being said, I had a good time seeing GI Joe: The Rise of the Cobra. Not enough to add to my collection, but enough to watch on television some night. There is a lot of action in this movie of course, beautiful women and world domination. What man would not love it? It can appeal to women as well as there are numerous attractive men throughout the entire film. And plenty of comedy.One thing that made this film exciting was the stars that popped out of nowhere to appear in the film. Dennis Quaid, Jonathan Pryce, Marlon Wayans and Arnold Vosloo. Every time a corner was turned, a new celebrity appeared. One thing I noticed was several actors from The Mummy franchise appeared, along with Vosloo. I won't tell you all of the names, you'll have to see it for yourself. My favorite was one who appears on a motorcycle during a training exercise.A plus about this film was the patriotism. Many people, myself included, feel that America can be a joke at times. The people sworn to protect this country are proud and show it in this movie. It renewed my faith.Good flick that appeals to men and women alike.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

184,rjyelverton,Film based on the exploits of plastic figures as good as expected,4,11 August 2009,"Fans of the G.I. Joe cartoons, actions figures and playsets--the movie showcases a host of vehicles and exotic bases--will find nostalgic charm in ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra."" The film is faithful to its source material right down to having the good guys shoot red lasers and the bad guys shoot blue lasers. This color coded anarchy is helpful during the manic on screen melees. It's no help when the two sword carrying ninjas face off. Why does the high tech, high body count, gun-toting Joe force need a ninja? Because the bad guys have a ninja, too. See: Cold war, arms race.The faithfulness to source material also means the movie is incredibly stupid. This is Saturday morning plotting on a giant budget. The bad guys are insanely evil. The good guys are all basically the same character--this one's the black good guy, this one's the French good guy, this one's a girl. Appropriately, for a film based on plastic figures, Channing Tatum plays the lead. The whole enterprise might have been winningly stupid had Stephen Sommers (""The Mummy"", ""Van Helsing"") cast someone else in the lead. Frequent Sommers' leading Brendan Fraser has a cameo in the film and one could imagine him successfully selling this frenetic mess as he has done before. He usually treats this kind of junk as comedy and brings us along for the ride. Tatum acts like he is starring in ""Saving Private Ryan."" The film does feature a strong action scene at its center where the good guys try to stop the bad guys from destroying the Eiffel Tower. The music ramps up, the action is more clearly defined than at any other point in the film, and the movie sucks us in for about twenty minutes. After the fight, the movie immediately devolves into heavy handed French bashing that will be bliss for anyone who enjoyed diplomacy is for wusses message of ""Transformers 2."" Here is yet another action movie trading in on and coasting on the nostalgia for plastic figures from our youth. It's a loud mess hopefully more indicative of the stupidity of summer than a dumbing down of the movies.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Channing Tatum sucks. Thank God they kept him to one liners. However, even when he had to convey some type of emotion without words, it was painful. The dude can't act and I believe he is a Hollywood turd dressed up to look shiny and exciting. I will be surprised to see him in anything significant other than G.I.

Different fighting styles, futuristic weapons, make this action packed movie a success. I looked for action in this movie and I found more than I expected, the special effects were very awesome. On the other hand, the movie could have been better. The plot of the movie was somewhat very simple, the script needed a lot of professional editing, also the acting was convincing but this could have been better. The critics gave this movie bad reviews, but I don't understand critics anymore, they give good movies bad reviews for no reason.

187,yasenkiranov,Kaboom!!!,5,11 November 2012,"""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is the epitome of mindless,unsophisticated entertainment.About 70% of the movie consists of over the top action scenes filled with explosions,lots and lots of 'em.I swear,this film breaks the record for most explosions in a single movie.The plot is really,really cliché - some guy wants to take over the world.The character development is at a bare minimum.Basically,the characters are given a background,which is also cliché.Other than that,there is a romance subplot.The thing that bugged me the most was the sheer stupidity of the dialog.I mean,half the lines the characters say make Forrest Gump look like Einstein and the other half is mainly techno babble...HOWEVER,""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is based on a cartoon meant for selling action figures to boys.And,to be completely honest,I thought the over the top action scenes were kinda cool.As much as I try not to let fancy special effects cloud my judgment,I have to admit,they were pretty damn impressive.Despite the fact,that I really ripped on the dialog,some of the humor in the movie isn't all that bad,though I am very easily amused.The thing I liked the most,however,was the training montage.I don't know why,but I really like training montages in general and i really enjoyed this one in particular.If you're not looking for anything sophisticated,than ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" is worth taking a look at.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
188,Cube_TX,More proof that critics are worthless,7,16 August 2009,"Originally I was very excited to see this movie; until I saw the first trailer -- which looked awful. Because I had been a fan of the comic book, toys and cartoons when I was younger, I still went to see the movie. I would probably have gone closer to opening day if not for the lousy trailer.I'm very glad I did see this movie. It was much better than I anticipated. The action scenes were very well done and kept a good level of intensity. The humor worked as well. The movie completely changes the mythology of the comics and cartoons (which were very different from one another themselves), but that's pretty typical in these kinds of movies. They didn't try too hard to make the movie serious and instead turned it into complete comic book fantasy.I did enjoy the movie, but it helped to have very, very low expectations. I'll say this flick was worth watching and I was never disappointed or bored (which is my main criticism of many movies -- the worst thing any of them can be is boring).Despite being based on a toyline, cartoon and comic it is NOT as much a kiddie movie as you would expect. It gets pretty violent and there are a lot of deaths, injuries and explosions. Being that it was made by the same guy who made The Mummy flicks you'll see a whole bunch of references to those movies; including a few of the actors and many plot references.From a fan perspective, they could have used a few of the more popular characters rather than the ones that were in the movie (Snake-Eyes, Duke and Scarlett were main characters, but Breaker, Ripcord and Heavy-Duty never really were). They also could have chosen actors who looked more like their comic book, toy or cartoon counterparts for just about all of the villains.Overall I'd recommend it and would buy the DVD. Not great, but good enough to see again.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

But is it weird that I liked this movie BECAUSE it's a pile of garbage? I don't know about you, but this movie is a definite guilty pleasure of mine. It's just so stupidly over-the-top, but in a way that kind of makes it fun to watch for me. And the science in The Rise of Cobra is so hilariously unrealistic and stupid that just makes it even more fun to watch. The effects are so poorly done, and the dialogue is either generic or cliched, that it almost makes this movie laughable. The effects aren't necessarily ""The Last Airbender"" levels of bad, but they're still not great. Especially when you have movies like ""Star Trek"" and ""Transformers 2"" that had fantastic visuals and came out the exact same year, so there's no excuse for a big budget movie like this to have effects that look worse than whatever short filmmakers on YouTube can create.What can I say? I love this movie, even though it sucks.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
190,marcoasleitao-905-480753,good and bad,4,21 September 2020,"It was a great action/adventure movie, but a horrible g.i.joe adaptation. The Joes were chosen randomly when they could have use some of the oldest. The uniforms should be like the original colorfoul and customized, instead of the all black suits like was done in x-men, taking away the soul of the characters.

191,jwhale9382,"Good popcorn flick, but it's not GI Joe!",4,6 August 2010,"For the longest time, I defended this movie. I was really excited to see a GI Joe movie, that I just went along with it. But now, almost a year later, having seen and heard all the facts, I've just gotta say, it stunk. Admittedly, it wasn't horrible, and there were a few things about this movie that I enjoyed, but overall, this movie was a real disservice to the franchise I loved as a kid.In the movie, the NATO-funded organization MARS Industries, led by wealthy arms-dealer James McCullen XXIV, develops a set of warheads loaded with metal-eating nanomites, a perfect weapon of mass destruction. When the covert military organization GI Joe hears about this and learns that MARS is a front for the terrorist organization COBRA, they set out to stop them and, along the way, recruit two new members, Duke and Ripcord. That should about sum up the plot.Now, I could nitpick this movie to death, and I have, but the main problems of this movie boil down to 3 things:1) Not enough GI Joe references: The movie may call itself GI Joe, it may have the GI Joe team, Cobra, the Pit and several characters named after GI Joe characters, but this movie does not resemble the GI Joe series at all. And I don't know how much this matters to anyone else, but it bugs me: the catchphrase, ""Yo Joe!"" only appears once in the whole movie. It's at the very end and spoken by a British guy. For this reason, or maybe some other reason entirely, it just doesn't sound right. And that really annoys me! Now, maybe if they called it something else, like Team America or Anti-Terrorist, Inc., maybe it wouldn't have been as bad, but they called it GI Joe which makes us compare it to the GI Joe franchise, and as far as I'm concerned, the two are unrelated. Just call it something else.2) A poorly written story: The plot makes absolutely no sense. The focus of the story, the warheads, are not explained enough to be an interesting plot point. The movie jumps around too quickly from on location to the next, which is just confusing. In addition, the movie is advertised as an origin story and we don't see an origin for either GI Joe or Cobra.3) The director is unfamiliar with the source material: That's right. When I heard that Stephen Sommers was going to be the director of GI Joe, I knew that the movie was in good hands, there was no way they could screw this up. Needless to say, I was really confused with the final product. And then, I learned that Sommers had never even heard of GI Joe prior to making this movie....Are you freaking kidding me?!Well, it certainly shows.But for all my complaining, there were a few good things about it. The action scenes were the highlight of this movie (except for the Pit scene). I loved the accelerator suits. Most people argue that the Joes don't have Iron Man armor, but I say whatever, it looks cool. Many of the actors were well cast, Dennis Quaid as Hawk, Christopher Eccleston as Destro, Ray Park as Snake-Eyes (the man with real superpowers) and Rachel Nichols as Scarlett. My favorite character was Ripcord. In contrast to his friend Duke, Ripcord was funny, he was active and he had a personality. Also, the special effects were impressive. The final action scene had me on the edge of my seat. Heck yeah!Overall, this is an okay popcorn flick, but as a GI Joe movie, it's an epic fail. If you're into mindless action scenes, get some friends together and check it out but if you're a die-hard GI Joe fan, avoid this one. It'll just make you angry.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
192,jasonpachar,Go Joe,10,24 June 2014,"Hasbro has done it again. With the success of the first two Transformers movies, G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra does the job. Growing up as a kid, I saw the cartoon for G.I. Joe and I really did not care much about it, but now that I'm older and have seen the movie, there is a much greater expectancy to it. This movie with an all star studded cast alongside with the sexiest heartthrob known to man – Channing Tatum does a tremendous job especially a cameo appearance from The Mummy star Brendan Fraser (nice touch!) Overall, I give Stephen Summers his props, he really pulled it off. I can't wait to see what he will come up with in the sequel.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
193,bramb600,"Poor filming making and lazy writing,",4,26 August 2009,"Normally when you see a blockbuster come out in August, it usually means that the movie isn't that great. That seems to be the case here because GI Joe is very bad. It's a movie, but it can hardly even be called a movie because it essentially is just an elaborate toy commercial as you can see when the Hasbro logo is shown before the film. This is actually the second movie to be produced by Hasbro this summer after Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen in June. There also seems to be a consistent pattern that the worst movies this year have been Hasbro productions.If you're expecting to see a direct adaptation of the GI Joe cartoon, then that's not what you're going to get here. This is an upgrade in technology and that could actually be quite entertaining for the first hour of the film. It's a big problem when you could tell that a lot of work was put into the special effects and not so much on the character development. I honestly couldn't care for anyone in this movie and it didn't help that they were so annoying.The plot is very simple. Basically all you need to know is that there are two sides, GI Joe vs. Cobra and they are fighting against each other. You are easily able to identify who is on which side.The movie is directed by Stephen Sommers that previously did The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and Van Helsing. I actually haven't seen any of the movies in The Mummy series but I have seen Van Helsing and I did like it the first time I saw it. When I watched it recently it was actually quite dull. So, he isn't exactly a great director.I guess I can briefly talk about the performances. You can't expect the acting in GI Joe to be anything special. In fact, it's quite terrible. No one is believable with these remarkably cheesy lines from the script. Even Dennis Quaid didn't impress me in this. I suppose this is a flaw that would be blamed on the writers, rather than the actors. I do know that Channing Tatum is terrible in anything that he's in. Marlon Waylons was also in it doing the comic relief. I thought that he was funny at times, but mostly his jokes and just fell flat. I can't say more about the performances that hasn't already been mentioned.The special effects in GI Joe were actually quite good at times, but it looked very fake at other times. Still, it saved it from becoming a complete disaster. I could say that I hated every scene in the movie, with the exception of the Paris scene which was the most fun I has with GI Joe and people seem to agree with me on that.And of course it ends with characters holding guns and walking towards the camera because it's a stereotypical brainless action movie.To conclude this review, I'm going to give GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra a 4/10. Still if you are a fan of brainless action movies, you might actually like GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra, but I still was very bad in my opinion.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
194,axopnk,Very Similar to Transformers,5,29 November 2009,"First off, i've never watched the original cartoon series so i am basing this review purely on an objective viewpoint. To me, this movie is similar to Transformers for the following reasons: 1. Has a hot chic 2. Fun/ Entertaining 3. Based on a 80's cartoon 4. A lot of unrealistic CGI Action 5. Confusing StorylineFirst, this is of course based on the big 80's cartoon of the decade so for cartoon fans there is a lot of characters there that they will recognize and love, but for most audiences some of the villains seem cheesy (Dr for example, Destro etc.) and the costume designs look average. Not bad just not great. Second, like all remakes of 80's cartoon's there has to be eye candy/bomb shell girl and while Megan Fox loves becoming the male fantasy dream, Sienna Miller is pretty hot just not as hot. Third, if you want a lot of CGI action like Transformers this is it. I'm just not a big fan of the whole CGI wave that has come about since the early 2000's. Even worse is this movie's CGI looks OK in some parts (jet) but really bad in others (sea craft, polar bear etc.). At least with Transformers they really invested into it, but in this movie, CGI wasn't a must have. They could have done better without it. Fourth, the storyline got messy toward the end. The basic storyline seemed simple. Creator of weapon wants to use his own weapons to rise to power by using Cobra. Seemed strait forward but it soon got to confusing: First by using the jump back method. Basically something happens then we view that character 4 years earlier then back to that character presently. This is done for facts and character development but the problem here is the director used it way to much. After awhile i started getting pretty bored and tired of the whole method and it suffers in the pace of the movie. Secondly, the storyline gets drowned out by to much CGI/ Action which makes the flash back scenes pointless. Third the flash back scenes are more CGI/Action. Overall the storyline gets confusing with too many characters, flashback scenes, actions, and plot twist which leaves the audience with ""i'm tired of trying to figure it out. Let me just watch action"". Not great if you want to have a sequel. Overall though, it is fun and entertaining. If you want a lot of action, dumb comedy, eye candy, and cool technology then this movie is for you.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
195,merdiolu,Somewhat Entertaining Toy movie but toy movie nonetheless,2,9 November 2009,"There is a new trend in Hollywood. Its unofficial name might be : ""Shortage of original scripts and producing dumber , sillier and flashier movies based on comics , toys or PC games"" I mean come on this is directed by Stephen Sommers and once you see his name you know that it is not Oscar material but after you see the movie ( finishing it might be a real ordeal for a regular average thinking person with some artistic taste ) any hope that there might be some substance in it quickly vanishes.G.I. Joe Rise of Cobra is basically a toy movie aimed for children and Hasbro fans in 1980'ies with large dose of US Army propaganda mixed. Every character , conversation , line was thinner than one dimensional. Channing Tatum might be a good dancer but he sucks when he tries to act as a soldier. Marlon Wayans was standard stereotype funny black sidekick...Adewale Akinnouye , Rachel Nichols , Said Taghmaoui were all one functional team members with their distinctive abilities and accents that's all....Snake Eyes played by Ray Parks only well laid out character and when your only well remembered character is a nameless ninja who does not utter a word throughout whole movie it means something is wrong in script writing...Veteran professional actors like Jonathan Pryce , Dennis Quaid , Arnold Vosloo and Christopher Eccleston should be embarrassed for their awful characterizations. I mean these are decent actors but material given them to perform was beyond terrible. ( Economic crisis must have hit Hollywood worse than I thought ) Adding Victoria's Secret top model Karolina Kurkova as a soldier with long unmilitary feminine hair and fatigues is a cheap shot to bait juvenile male viewers...I am at loss to describe the character writing of James Gordon Lewitt's Rex/Doctor. Not only awfully overdone it was copied directly from Star Wars along with his and Destro's change. And the plot was so over cliché and simplistic ( launching missiles with deadly warheads to spread chaos , US President ) with stereotype simplistic speeches/coversations ( I AM SOOOO EVIL HAHAHAHA ) it wouldn't even be shown in a live action cartoon series anymore.What was good ? Well CGI , special effects and sets were not bad but hey that was a Stephan Sommers film what do you expect ? He tries to sell movie through CGI ( like Michael Bay does )",G.I.

I'm not going to see this movie, and you can't - *Is abducted by a tribe of Turbonerds and forced to watch the movie. Returns an hour later, gagging*Oh sweet melting Kubrick, I never thought it would be THAT bad. Excuse me, it's not even noon yet and I need to start drinking.All right. I'm going to desperately try to put my thoughts in order here.Whew.GI Joe, the Rise of Cobra, is the story of Dr. Who #9, mangling a Scottish accent, and creating nanomites of mass destruction, then tries to steal them from himself so the evil organization Cobra can use them to take over the world. Ow. Ow. Ow.It hurts already. Guarding the shipment is Duke, and his politically correct Black Friend, and a team of redshirts that get killed in the resulting assault from a piece of CGI containing the movie's main piece of tail, 'The Baroness.' Who apparently Duke has met before, fell in love with her, knows everything about her from before she went evil and discovered black hair die and push up bras.Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. So then... Duke is saved miraculously by Go Joe, the ultra-secret GI Joe team who is so classified, unless you really want to know, then they'll tell you... but they don't have to kill you for it, apparently, because this is the worst kept secret in the world with 23 countries joining this elite team with super comic book tech and a secret base in flipping Egypt with hoverplanes, stealth suits, and other special toys...

In some attempt to bring order to the chaos of the world... because of course destroying major cities always pacifies a panicked populace... *Passes out*Okay. This was just the first forty minutes. I even stayed through Transformers 2. This movie isn't just bad, it's worse than Michael Bay bad. It's almost Ewe Boll bad. I didn't even get to the 'accelerator suits' they touted in the trailer, and good thing, because I think it actually would have given me a fatal dose of stupid. It's LESS moronic than the cartoon! At least the cartoon knew what it was. It was a silly little half-hour toy commercial that, half the time, tried to teach an important life lesson. It was pure 80's cheese.

Joe organization, the Cobra organization, Cobra Commander, Destro and the Baroness I don't remember them.It doesn't matter because the G.I. Joe movie is written for a general audience. Like the new James Bond and the new Star Trek this is a reboot of the G.I Joe story. I am positive major changes were made so the story could move quickly and finish in a few hours.I enjoyed the movie a lot. There are girls, gadgets, vehicles and explosions.

No Cobra insignias, and we sure weren't in Springfield. And it was way too high tech. We are talking about a start-up evil terrorist army, right? So, at least they finally answer the Cobra Commander question at the end, but that didn't look like the Cobra Commander I remember either. More like something from Predator. That said, for an action movie, designed to indoctrinate perspective teenage military recruits, it was great. Archetypally, it was very much Star Wars/Return of the Jedi, or any other 'evil mastermind wants to destroy the world just because' plot. It was fun, but clearly these 80's era action/adventure producers would do well to have me writing their scripts.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
199,psychogoatee,An action joyride with a very likable cast.,9,10 August 2009,"G.I. Joe is a fast paced action film, with characters that are lovable enough to make it a joy to watch.As our heroes, we notably have Scarlett (Nichols) and Ripcord (Wayans), who have a fun romance throughout. Rachel Nichols is great, very sexy with a sense of fun, and Marlon shines as the wisecracking nice guy hero. Then we have the stoic warriors Duke (Tatum) and Snake Eyes (Park) kicking ass. Giving orders and being enjoyably intense and cheesy, in a good way, is Dennis Quaid as General Hawk.Tormenting our heroes at every turn, we have Baroness (Miller) and Storm Shadow (Lee) with the most screen time. This pair are a joy to watch as they have fun wreaking havoc. Sienna Miller rocks as the sexy bad girl, and Byung-hun Lee is amazingly suave. Their commander is done justice by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who fills the classic role of the maniacal villain.The story takes these two lovably entertaining groups of characters, and puts them in a constant series of battles throughout the film. There are brief interludes to flesh out the characters, which do add to the film, but for the most part it's just a joy to watch these warriors go at it.Sit back and watch as the awesomely entertaining over-the-top war rages on.",G.I.

200,DirtyStarling,Meh,5,1 September 2009,"This movie didn't really do anything for me. I didn't love it, I didn't hate it... I just really didn't care. However, this is one I saw from the trailers and knew it was going to be pretty dumb.GI Joe is based on the cartoon series with Cobra, which is sort of silly in itself, so you've got silly source material (just like with Transformers). What happens in this film is that... they know the material is silly, and they just made it really generic and cheesy and really just embraced the silliness and said, ""F*** it. Were just going to play.""The characters are about as 1 dimensional as you can get, the story is just a generic action movie story. The acting is OK at times and AWFUL at others. Likewise the special effects are really good in some scenes and in others they're just crap. The story is just an excuse to have more explosions and special effects, and the creators forced in as many references to the cartoon series as they could, disregarding whether or not it actually fits in the scene.Overall, the film is just silly. There are some cool effects, some cool action sequences, but the whole thing is just meant to be silly fun. If you're just looking for a generic action film to sit down with some friends and watch while drinking a few beers, I'd recommend this. You could do worse. However, I would really only recommend this if you're just trying to have some fun and you don't really care what you watch.5/10 - Some cool action, but not really anything special.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
201,SebaZava,What Transformers 2 should have been and sadly wasn't,8,7 August 2009,"I was very looking forward to the G.I. Joe film, not because I'm a fan of the toys or the animated series, but because I knew what to expect: tons of cool special effects and some really exciting action. And guess what? That's exactly what the film provides.If there's something G.I. Joe is, it's an action movie. But unlike movies like Transformers 2, Sommers' motion picture actually succeeds at providing with wall-to-wall action. Unlike Michael Bay, he doesn't insert explosions every three seconds, and doesn't seem to have the need of shaking his camera like a madman so that the audience doesn't have a clue of what's happening. Yes, there is a lot of action in this movie, but it is of the comprehensible sort, meaning the viewer actually knows if his favorite characters are in danger and also has the opportunity of enjoying and being marveled by the special effects instead of watching balls of fire and tons of CGI that doesn't make sense. Sommers' approach to action is almost ""old-fashioned"", and I thanks him for that. Of course, that doesn't mean that all of the action sequences work beautifully; some of them are a little tiresome actually. There is no denying, though, that the Paris action set-piece is quite awesome, both in terms of special effects, and in terms of how excited and tense it made me feel.Now, regarding the special effects... yes, they are by no means perfect, and yes, the film does have a sort-of artificial look from time to time, but it's nothing serious. Sommers always inserts a lot of computer-generated effects and other extravagances in his movies, and although these kinds of tricks have improved in quality during the last couple of years, it's always hard to make them look 100% realistic if you're inserting them virtually everywhere. (The movie doesn't have an infinite budget, after all.) Nevertheless, because the film doesn't take itself excessively seriously (unlike Revenge of the Fallen), these kinds of ""mistakes"" are allowed. I even accepted a final ""revelation"", which occurs during the last few minutes of runningtime, and which includes a ""new"" (and very cheesy) Darth Vader-looking bad guy. Why? Because I accepted the fact that this is a ""toy movie"", and that nothing (expect maybe some of the characters) should be taken too seriously.Performances are what should be expected from this kind of movie. Not particularly strong, but not bad either. The standout is Sienna Miller, who is almost unrecognizable with black hair and dark glasses. (She looks really hot, though.) She seems to be having lots of fun playing the bad guy, and thus manages to create a very memorable and entertaining character. Rachel Nichols is cute and believable as Scarlett, and Marlon Wayans is great as Ripcord; he can be funny and dorky from time to time, but because he's also a pretty good soldier and because he's never too goofy, one can take his character (kinda) seriously. His flirting with Nichols was great, not only because it was fun, but because it was - for a lack of a better word - awesome to see an inter-racial romance making an appearance in a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Christopher Eccleston is effective as a megalomaniac villain, and despite their small parts, the likes of Dennis Quaid (always reliable, that bloke), Brendan Fraser and Jonathan Pryce (!) are memorable. The one disappointment, though, is Channing Tatum, who as Duke is almost as wooden as Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker. He looks good during the action sequences, but that's about it.The main reason, though, of why G.I. Joe is so much superior to Revenge of the Fallen (I know I'm comparing both movies a little too much, but it's almost unavoidable) is that the former actually has memorable and fun characters worth rooting for, while the latter has virtually no characters, and instead provides with a gazzilion CGI robots who look virtually all the same during the confusing action sequences. I like the fact that each Joe is given a back-story through flashbacks (the most interesting is definitely the one concerning Snake Eyes and his rival, Storm Shadow), and I also like the fact that, despite having very archetypical personalities, each character is instantly recognizable and played with style. The screenplay might not be particularly smart (although it's a million times wittier and organized than the one for Michael Bay's picture), but it accomplishes what it sets to do: provide with nice and entertaining characters, a plot that actually makes sense, and action sequences that don't feel repetitive or dull.So has Stephen Sommers and his creative team managed to fulfill expectations? Well, considering buzz for the movie a couple of months ago was horribly negative, it won't be hard for the filmmakers to please their audience, but even if expectations had been higher, I don't think viewers would have emerged disappointed from theatres. I can say I was a Joe virgin before watching the movie; I knew nothing about the characters, the plot or the role of the ""Cobra"" organization in the series' mythos, but after watching the film, I am now more interested in everything related to it. Needless to say, the movie does do a really good job at presenting the characters and the plot to newbies, and I'm sure that for die-hard fans, it is a very entertaining and visually-pleasing way to revisit their favorite characters. With its comprehensible action, cool special effects, effective performances and mildly-interesting plot, G.I. Joe is one of the better big-budget action extravaganzas I've seen in some time.

203,chi-cerca-trova,"Fun, tightly executed summer movie",8,6 August 2009,"GI JOE was a film I was wary going into. I loved the toys and animated show growing up, and this seemed like a cynical cash in. And to an extent, it was. There is no use denying that.However, I realized that, as a summer blockbuster, it works wonderfully on that level. Devious bad guys, squared jaw good guys and thrilling action pieces make this a fun adventure.Stephen Sommers has steadily gone down hill the past few years. I really enjoyed The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. Then The Scorpian King and Van Helsing were complete duds to me. But, GI JOE is a return to form. Tightly directed action sequences, characters that don't try to hard to fit their niche and actors who filled the roles they were meant to fill.So, I enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a summer movie for what it is.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
204,SophomoreSlump,Do not underestimate it!,8,15 August 2009,"After Transformer: Revenge of the Fallen, most people weren't getting their hopes high for GI Joe. It wasn't even screened for critics fearing that they might and will bash it. However, do NOT underestimate GI Joe because it is something completely different.First, the storyline itself is 'smart' for this type of adrenaline-filled action movie. It is one long storyline that starts at the middle, then goes back to the beginning with the efficient uses of flashbacks and it finishes off with all the questions answered at the end. This way, you'll keep guessing throughout and the twist is also great – if you haven't read the spoilers, that is. I also love the fact that most of the characters have their own backstories and some even intertwine. The characters show development and are lovable, even the bad guys like Baroness and Storm Shadow.Next, the action and visual effect is really fun to watch. The editing is neat and camera angles are superb. Some scenes might not be as realistic as others but that is okay because it makes the movie looks like a real live-action cartoon. There's plenty of choreographed hand-to-hand and sword fights, shoot-outs and an awesome car chase scene where the Joes are trying to stop the Baroness from destroying the Eiffel Tower – and the Joes are not even in a car.The acting, honestly, is nowhere near Oscar-worthy. It's cheesy and awkward most of the time. But it fits because it gives the movie a B-movie feel to it. Super-evil villains trying to take over the world, a great leader, a wise-crack, add in some philosophical lines, silly one-liners and scientific jargon nonsense and it will spell 'Fun'! However, the movie contains a lot of flaws. I mean, sinking ice? What? But you have to remember that this movie is based on a toy franchise, and a cartoon and comic series whose sole purpose is to sell those toys. So it could easily be forgiven.All in all, if you're seeking a fun, action-spiked, filled with testosterone movie that you just want to watch, laugh, be awed by the visual and just want to turn your brain off, relax and enjoy, then GI Joe is just the thing.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
205,Apemangalore,Much better than expected,6,8 August 2009,"Going into G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, I was expecting – to be fairly blunt – an absolute trainwreck of a movie. I've hated just about every one of Stephen Sommers' films (with the exception of the first Mummy, which I simply didn't mind), the cast that was announced didn't impress me in the slightest, nor did the trailers or clips that were released. However, for some bizarre reason, I still found myself being excited to see it, and having just done so, I have to say that I was pretty pleasantly surprised.One of the things that I found refreshing about this movie is that, unlike, say, Transformers 2, it knows what it wants to be. The film doesn't pander to any specific audience, nor does it try to make the source material out to be anything more than what it actually is. Also, while the film has a good number of very cartoonish moments, it never goes too over the top, to the point where you feel that the tone of the film has been disrupted.The action sequences, too, are solid and fun, despite the visual effects ranging from so-so to outright laughable. The camera, for the most part, stays perfectly still, giving you a clear view of what's going on – another refreshing aspect about this movie.Now, the performances are a mixed bag overall. Sienna Miller (Baroness), Dennis Quaid (Hawk), Arnold Vosloo (Zartan), and Rachel Nichols (Scarlett) are pretty solid in their roles. Ray Park and Byung-hun Lee as Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, respectively, are especially brilliant; in fact, I could've easily gone for an entire movie centered around those two characters. However, Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans as the film's two main heroes, Duke and Ripcord, are extraordinarily awful (the former's performance being one of the worst I've seen on film in a long time).Overall, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, is a solid, fun flick that features some decent action sequences, a simple, yet not overly stupid, story, and some surprisingly likable characters. It's not a particularly memorable film, but certainly much better than I was expecting.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
206,jmcginn174,Can director Stephen Sommers direct?,5,16 June 2011,"Going into this movie I honestly thought it was going to be terrible move, maybe 1 star or worse, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was a decent movie. That being said I wouldn't pay to see it in the theater I'd wait till it comes out on DVD and rent it.The story was bad and had major plot holes or didn't make any sense, but what can you expect from a Stephen Sommers movie(As you can tell I really don't like the his directing/writing).The acting was decent with Dennis Quaid(General Hawk), Christopher Eccleston(Destro). He's also good in Doctor Who. Byung-hun Lee(Storm Shadow) and Ray Park(Snake Eyes). Though Sommers and the rest of the writers destroyed their great stories from they had from the cartoon and comics. As for everyone else from Channing Tatum to Marlon Wayans pretty much sucked.Action/Special Effects I thought were the best part of the film. The high not was the battle in Paris which was great. The other action scenes were visual good but weren't well executed especially the underwater one.Now for my tangent on the so call director Stephen Sommers. Back to my first question. Can Stephen Sommers direct, and the overwhelming evidence says NO! Lets look at the list of films he has directed.Deep Rising, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Van Helsing, and GI Joe. The only film that I though was above mediocre was The Mummy which I gave 3 1/2 stars. The rest were Mediocre to terrible.Now lets look at all the things he's written/screenplay.Deep Rising, The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King, Van Helsing, and G.I. Joe. Again the only really decent film was The Mummy. Is he the worst director/writer out there of course not but he is really bad.Now if this movie manages to make enough money to garner a sequel. Which I truly think is in question. Here are a few things their going to need to do to bring me back.1. Get rid of Stephen Sommers. There are a lot better directors than him.2. Get rid of Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans. They were two of the worst actors in this film.3. Make the second film better. I'd say less is more. You don't have to have these over the top actions scenes to have make entertaining movie. Also add move depth to the characters like Snake Eyes, Scarlet and Destro. Last thing add more drama and suspense.If the producers can do the majority of this I'd be on board for another film other wise this potential franchise is done.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
207,on_the_can,Loads of fun,7,16 August 2009,"I'm gonna lay it all out on the table for ya. The plot is far from award material. The dialogue can be quite cheesy at times and the acting sometimes comes through as awkward thanks to that aforementioned dialogue. The characters for the most part don't have a lot of depth and most of the scenarios are about as realistic as a Chuck Jones cartoon. But to be frank...I couldn't care less! This movie is so entertaining it's down right criminal to dwell on all these aspects. The story may not be award material but that doesn't mean it's bad. After a nearly failed military attempt to protect a top secret and extremely volatile weapon from a high tech terrorist group, the two soldiers primarily responsible for the weapon's safety are recruited into a secret world wide counter terrorist branch known as G.I. Joe. From then on it's a global game of capture the flag as the Joes fight to keep the weapon from the enemy and the enemy fights to get the weapon from the Joes. The weapon trades hands here and there and it's all in the name of action and fun.The actors involved are all more than capable and for the most part they do a good job. A script doctor could have been put to good use to clean up some of the dialogue and that would have saved the cast from some embarrassing moments. There were also a few ill-advised attempts at drama, which was forced and out of place given the rest of the movie's tone. This stuff though, compared to the epic scale action that eats up most of the screen time is pretty minor.The action is definitely overblown but the filmmakers were well aware of it when they put it together. It's adrenaline pumping, edge of your seat type stuff with all kinds of imagination, cool vehicles and gadgetry. I was pretty young in the cartoons hay day but from what I remember this captures the tone of the series pretty well and you can tell from the ending that as the franchise evolves into a sequel or two it will more closely resemble the original in plot...which I imagine put a lot of stewing fanboys at ease.Would I want to see a sequel exactly like this? No. This movie basically serves one main purpose in the grand scheme of things, and that's to introduce a whole slew of characters, but not at the expense of action. That's no easy feat but they did it. I would hope that the sequel gets a little deeper into character and plot, and I think that it most likely will. And as long as they keep the excitement at this level, I'll be in line for a ticket.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
208,xgray-03873,"""Nooo Joe!!!!!!""",5,23 April 2016,"Yeah, I'm sorry. But, this movie was kind of a huge disappointment for me as someone who wasn't really into G.I. Joe as a kid. But, as a fellow geek, I was expecting for this movie to at least get me interested into the franchise. Unfortunately, this isn't the G.I. Joe movie that I was looking for at all. Aside from the casting choices of Dennis Quaid as General Clayton M. Abernathy/Hawk and Christopher Eccleston as Laird James McCullen XXIV/Destro and the characters of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, the rest of the cast weren't that good of portraying the characters at all. And, I didn't like what they did to the Cobra Commander and the Baroness in this movie. Plus, Marlon Wayans wasn't that funny in this movie.So, if you're like a fan of Stephen Sommers, you might find at least four cameos from the cast members of the Mummy 1 & 2. But, you're not gonna get as much excitement from the Mummy movies in this movie. It's best to just skip this movie and go watch the cartoons instead.I'd give ""G.I.

209,synevy,Action anyone?,6,11 April 2012,"To save some time, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is a 2009 science fiction action film based on the G.I. Joe toy franchise, with particular inspiration from the comic book and cartoon series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero (which i've never read). And that's all i need to know right now.Here, the elite military team G.I. Joe that operates outside the federal nets, has to deal with a vicious arms dealer and his feisty company. I hadn't seen the full cast or story before i started the film, so i was pleasantly surprised when i saw Christopher Eccleston (9th Doctor Who) in it. He's fantastic! I knew Channing Tatum was there too. He can easily pull off such roles and he's still improving. Marlon Wayans and Joseph Gordon-Levitt also make good appearances, alongside Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols. My most memorable characters though, are Snake Eyes (Ray Park) and Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee).The story was satisfying for an action film. The flashbacks, even though helpful to figure out what brought each character to this point, were a bit distracting, like they were put in a wrong sequence or something. But nothing else matters when it comes to the action and cgi. You'll get A LOT of it. Maybe more than you planned for. I had to watch it in mute for a couple of times due to all the explosions and shooting! The music wasn't much for its, almost, two-hour duration but then again we're talking about A LOT of explosions.Just hang out with your friends (or however you like) and enjoy some swords and guns and fighting.",G.I.

211,lostinaction,The better Hasbro Movie of 2009,7,10 August 2009,I have to admit that I don't think that I belong to the target audience of this Popcorn Flick. Nevertheless at the end I thought this movie wasn't that bad and at least I was entertained. At the beginning and more or less the first half I was afraid to see just another Michael Bay Ripp Off with a lot of CGI explosions and Good Guy's (and Girls) versus Bad Guys (Girls)fights . It is but interestingly the movie was getting better and more suspenseful for me in the second half. For me the movie starts with the chase in beautiful Paris. That's what I would call thrilling entertainment. I also enjoyed all the fights between the good Ninja in a black suit and the bad Ninja in a white suit. The action scenes are more violent as in Transformers 2 and there are several murder scenes.Another positive point was that some the characters were connected through their past which can be seen in their flashbacks. So if people are saying there was no characterization in this movie it's just not true. The other highlight was Sienna Miller as a Villainess called Baroness. She clearly had the best role in this movie. Her performance had style and was remarkable. Don't know why everybody is talking in summer 2009 about Megan Fox Sienna Miller is the Popcorn Movie Queen of the Year. I'm a fan of the X-Men series and somehow the second half reminded me on these great flicks. The humor with Marlon Wayans as Ripcord was well paced but I wished there would have been some more.I never played with the GI Joe Toys from Hasbro and I'm not into the created stories round the Toys. So I cannot judge if this movie was close to the stories or not but I can say that this flick was fun. Whereas at the end of Transformers 2 I wasn't quite interested in a sequel I cannot say the same about G.I.Joe: Rise of the Cobra. Oh yes I want to know what will happen next.,G.I.

Oh, what a good laugh I had.Also, the irish accent of the bad guy was pretty funny too, because what kinda badass has such a funny irish accent like that? I couldn't take him seriously, at all.Well, it's a good popcorn flick for the summer, T4 and Trans2 was much better than this action frenzy of a film, but it was nice, worth my money. Sierra Miller never looked so hot before, I think I had an orgasm when I saw her in that sexy latex suit and those sexy glasses. Adding Marlon Wayans to the film was good for comic relief, I kinda liked the movie for that. Channing Tatum still remains to be a homo actor in my eyes. The whole ebonics accent was killing it, seriously. They should of got Arnie or Stallone to play GI JOE. So the first flaw to me was the horrible CGI. You could notice it at the first few minutes of the movie. The choppers flying by, were all CGI, and pretty bad too. Looked like it came straight from a next-gen video game cut scene. The second flaw was the cheesy lines like ""knowing is half the battle"" . I know it's iconic and all, but you know you're never gonna make the movie as accurate as the TV show or comics, might as well leave that crappy line out. Another flaw was that they didn't have any nude scenes for Sienna Miller, she should of stripped naked just for my viewing pleasure.Well that's it, doubt that I'll be watching it again or even renting it on blu-ray, but it was worth it for Sienna Miller and her nice rack.",G.I.

213,twi1609372,"A real ""American Hero""?",6,9 August 2009,"First, the GI Joe franchise is good, but I won't blindly love everything that comes out of it. By modern standards and even traditional standards this wasn't a bad movie; but it was far from great. As the other comment noted, the animation is so prevalent, it is a wonder why it wasn't simply all computer animated. First, what was this movie and what wasn't it. It was not a well thought out story. This was an introduction to a film series. This was all the characters and toys being introduced to give somewhat of a back-story for the upcoming movies. So much so it seems like they forgot that this was a ""movie"" also.If you want planes to crash into the grand canyon, killing all persons on board, except for the main character; who seem to be able survive falling head first into a volcano, then this is about what you will see. If you don't mind being able to predict each and every move each person makes, well then you won't mind this movie. Not horrible overall, but far from great.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
214,firefox2k,THIS is what summer movies should be,10,8 August 2009,"When i saw the promos for this movie, i thought it might be OK, maybe just a cool, forgetful flick....I WAS WRONG!!This movie is what summer movies should be. It has everything a great movie should be, in fact i will call this THE BEST movie of the year, so far....G.I. JOE was 2 times better than transformers and 10 times better than Harry potter. What made this movie so great? Well if you take The Empire Strikes Back, mix it with a little James Bond, add a dash of Firefox, you should have one great movie, and we do.The really great thing about this movie is it COULD be believable, in a small manner. The technology in the movie, we do have in today's military...souped-up of course, but we do have it. Cybersuits, nanobots, holographic displays, voice control...all in real life. But i digress...What makes this an ultimate movie is we have an ACTUAL and Believable Plot..something lacking in other movies we have had.We have the Hero, with a trouble and emotional past. Strong, brave, and just a little crazy. We have the Bad Guy, who doesn't start as the bad guy, nor as the top dog, but is in the title of the movie, and will be the focus of the sequel to come. The bad guy has a trouble past, and a thirst for more power, and doesn't want to play second fiddle to no one. Finally we have the mystery man...No one knows his TRUE intentions. Is he just a pawn/lap dog for the bad guy, or does he have his own sinister intentions??? We have action, excitement, intrigue, and a couple of good laughs as well. This movie is a movie I would, and in fact did see again, and have recommend others to see as well. even if they aren't GI JOE fans.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
215,jeethjohnp,Something that I enjoyed this summer,7,6 August 2009,"One thing I would like to state before I start with my review is that I am a big fan of G.I.Joe cartoon and the action figures when I was a kid... I use to worship them...So, when the movie was announced I was excited...But when the posters and the trailers got out I went ""Oh, What the hell"".... I went in for the movie with zero expectation. But boy was I blown. It is a fast-paced out and right action film. Those of you who expect a good story can pack up and avoid this. The G.I.Joe cartoons never had any story...it just had the frequent fights between Joe's and The Cobra....So I was not let down by the lack of a solid story. And the acting was the typical type that can be found in such popcorn summer flicks. And I am happy Sommer's has tried to keep some of the core stuffs of G.I.Joe intact while changing other stuffs for better viewing. The CGI is a bit of a let down at some points...but I stopped thinking about that after the non-stop action started..... This summer was a big let down in terms of wolverine, transformers 2, et al...this is a better outing than all of those.... Just watch it with the right mind set and anybody can enjoy this flick.....",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
216,ennieday09,A lower rating than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen? Now that's wrong,7,30 September 2009,"I will admit I wasn't expecting an epic classic movie out of G.I Joe but what I liked about it was that it was exactly what I expected it to be and that is lots of cool action scenes and not too much over the top humor. I add the title about Transformers because we all know Transformers 2 did not live up to the hype and we all know the humor in that movie is what pretty much ruined the film. G.I Joe however wasn't too hyped, it made much more sense and it was much more satisfying in my opinion. There were some pretty cheesy moments and the plot outline was sort of scattered around everywhere, but to be serious, a movie starring Channing Tatum about a G.I Joe movie you can't expect good acting or a serious plot. Enjoy the movie for what it is and that's great and I mean GREAT action sequences. Lets hope the sequel takes the story a little more serious next time.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
217,michael11391,The best action flick this summer.,5,5 August 2009,"While Star Trek and Transformers 2 were my favorite action movies this summer, G.I. Joe came in and blew both out of the water completely!! The action is so non-stop and exhilarating that your jaws will drop immediately of how awesome the action sequences is, it just never lets up!! The acting is all right (better than both Transformers combined): Every girl's dream Channing Tatum did all right but started to go downhill throughout, Dennis Quaid as General Hawk was good with his role, Rachel Nichols as Scarlett was hot as usual and good with her role, The always-sexy Sienna Miller as Baroness was pretty good, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Heavy Duty did a good job, Joesph Gordon-Levitt as Cobra Commander was awesome, Said Taghmaoui as Breaker did good and provied most of the humor in the movie and Marlon Wayans as Ripcord(probably did the best acting of the lot) showed not only his serious side but his funny side as usual, he was funny.G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra is not the best action film ever made but it is the best action flick of this summer. It's just a big budget brainless, always fun and extremely entertaining popcorn movie. Also, I came with high expectations with this movie because it just looked like my type of movie, a mix of: Star Trek, Transformers and Iron Man. All three movies that are some of my favorite action movies ever, G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra joins the list of my favorite action movies. If you were a fan of the toys, go see this and you will NOT be disappointed at all. If your a fan of movies like this: Star Trek, Transformers or Iron Man like me, go see this awesome action flick!!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

219,lndkramer,Another summer let down,5,9 August 2009,"I just saw the movie today so I wanted to do this while it was fresh in my mind.I was never a GI Joe fan, but of course when a big summer blockbuster like this comes along, any guy is gonna go see it. (Even if the only other summer blockbuster I enjoyed this year was Star Trek.) GI Joe, though entertaining and containing some warm and fuzzy moments, was another let down for me. I won't drag this out, since it doesn't take much explaining.The acting was sub par at best. Tatum, not a bad actor, but not badass enough to carry this. There were moments where I was all the way behind him, and other moments where I wondered how he got casted.Gordon-Levitt. Been around a while, always been decent. But he turns into this evil villain and hams it up so bad, you want to die every time he's on the screen. Reminded me of a power ranger villain. There was literally a part when he ""Muahahahaha""'d in there. Horrible.That leads me to the writing. There was some laughably bad dialogue that makes you wonder who they thought would be watching this movie. And it bothers me even more that decent enough actors were forcing out these cheesy lines. The guy who played in Traitor and Vantage Point is usually good as well. But he plays the nerdy computer hacker guy, he's so wimpy and corny I can't stand him. Oh and by the way, somehow we can pinpoint someone's location by seeing where their shadow was 50 hours ago. Wtf?? Oh well. Throw in Marlon Wayans for a couple cheap chuckles and it's OK.The special effects weren't even good enough to make up for the bad acting. But it did have decent action scenes, and they were also nice and long. Good rental, good time killer, but not a classic at all.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
220,XpocalypseSurvival,Everything in this movie shoots rockets.,6,12 March 2021,"Rating: 6/10. High production value and special effects. Movie is filled with action and gadgets which keeps it entertaining. It is a comic book movie, and it definitely has a comic-book feel to it. Characters and events are very typical for action movies (car chases, silly romantic interests, etc.) The ninjas were interesting. If you like Michael Bay movies, you should be good.Survival Lesson: Nobody wins all the time. You must be mentally prepared to faces losses.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
221,Filmaholic78,Good for what it is,7,6 August 2009,"I watched this film last night and luckily I had no high expectations. As a fan of the G.I Joe toys when I was a kid (back then they where called Action Force) I had a good idea of the characters and story before hand. I am glad to say this film stayed true to most of the original concepts with a few tweaks for the better here and there.Go see this film if you want to see a fun action film full of special effects and doesn't take itself too seriously.Don't go and see this film if you are an uptight, unhappy film critic that spends too much time highlighting plot holes and acting because that's not what this film is about. It's more of a roller-coaster ride. Fast, furious and just fun.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
222,djray65,Laughably implausible,4,12 June 2010,"Typical popcorn fare with all the CGI butter toping one could hope for. As if strait out a Saturday morning cartoon, this had all the trappings of an action packed trill ride. Although it was outrageous and some times ridiculous it was fun to watch. Just remember to suspend all semblance of reality. I was a bit surprised to see many powerhouse actors in this movie, although the main hero played by Channing Tatum was not one of them. He comes across like a football jock that has been getting drunk at a pub then finds out it's a gay bar. However the ""real"" actors could not save it. The story was over the top, but that is expected as this movie is aimed at 14-year-old kids. While I didn't hate this movie, I did think it was silly and often laughable at times. That said it did have some entertaining qualities.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

For example, when i first heard of this movie i though ""oh no, another America movie, by some American company, trying to make as much money as they can, over-using cgi, and totally destroying a good thing, that being the original G.I. Joe cartoon"". After watching the film that followed the usual modern day formula for a story: -BEGINNING- hype some silly problem (the missiles, you might have heard) -MIDDLE- send in captain CGI to save the day, and -END- advertise for the next installation of the film. It leaves nothing left to say except that my initial thought was right, oh, and please don't waste your time making G.I. Joe 2.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
224,BlackJack_88,I just can't wait to write this review - Worst 2 hours of my life,1,21 October 2012,"Pathetic movie I've ever seen. The film on the whole has no plot. They break every law of Physics (RIP Einstein & Newton) in this movie.. Every technology they use is far far far advanced (probably cr*p). I don't think anyone can create such weapons (except in CG). In one scene a GI-Joe commando tries to shoot a Cobra commando but misses. She then hides beside a truck, rewinds some cr*p display in her gun marks the cobra commando's eyes and then shoots. The bullet travels some cities nearby and then strikes into the eye of the cobra commando (Stephen Sommers I just cannot believe that you directed The Mummy). That was the start of disgust in the movie, then everything goes as per your expectation (I mean worse).. Cr*ppy technologies, cr*ppy dialogues (yeahhhhh !! oooohaaaaa !!) The GIJOE team seems to know about every technology the COBRA team uses and vice versa (maybe some Open Source Software). They plunge into the GIJOE pit easily by making few damages (OMG ... what a security for a military organization!!). Overall a CR*P movie full of unbelievable sh*t. I really feel blessed for having not watched this movie in theater. The real need now arises for IMDb to keep ratings in minus. This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen and my rating will be not more than -10. You can definitely give this movie a miss..",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
225,wbafanclub12,Strangely decent in its own way. ....,7,11 August 2009,"Without going into too much detail I had to go and see this film as part of my work. I was not looking forward to seeing it as I really did not think it was the sort of film that would appeal to me, imagining it to be a hybrid between street fighter and transformers. In some ways I wasn't disappointed. The corniness is definitely there in abundance. The special effects at times were hard pushed to seem realistic and the storyline was quite amazingly far fetched. And normally all the above would not make for a good film, as far as I am concerned anyway. But strangely this film was an interesting watch. I cant for one minute imagine it will ever force its way into anybody over 11's top ten film but there was something uncomfortably enjoyable about it. I certainly am not into the comic strip although must admit to having one of the action force figure 25 years ago. But that is not the attraction. The film for me is a complete mismatch of parts which all join together to make one good whole. In between the brief love story and at times funny humour is a film which is action packed for a whole one and half hours. The storyline, although far fetched moves as quick as the action scenes so you are never left thinking 'Yawn....too long'. The ending not only satisfies the viewer but also leaves enough scope for a sequel which I can definitely see coming sooner rather than later. Your imagination or process of thought will not be stretched by any means, but what you have here is a jolly decent movie flick which despite its 12a rating I think is suitable for most ages.",G.I.

226,ercarvajal,Why...why...why is Hollywood screwing every good story I used to like?!!!,2,17 August 2009,"Why am i giving such a bad score: because I feel betrayed, this is not the G.I. Joe I used to watch (The Real American Heroes series of the 80's); this is not how the story goes, the main characters are not as the TV series used to be, although Duke, Snake Eyes, Hawk, Scarlett and some others frequent-ones appear.Yes, lot of action as expected, that is kind of cool; lots of Fx's, but the whole character history/background was change, to the point where: ""Duke is a novice G.I. Joe wannabe"", and The Baroness was his lover and the sister of Cobra Commander... what a piece of s@#$@#$...No no no, It's not fair! please, respect the past... G.I.

227,myungjahigh,enjoyable,6,21 March 2012,"Well.. it could be not good, but I enjoyed G.I.Joe. Story was banal, ending scene looks a little bit hurriedly built, but what I liked about this movie is that lots of characters have their own color and specific features. People in G.I.Joe might be too many, but they are well described and all included. Also, this movie means a lot to me. I was glad that Byung-hun Lee did a good job as Storm Shadow. It is quite hard for korean actors to have a chance to star in Hollywood films, but I really think that Lee did go well with the character. Now I am looking forward to watching the prequel of G.I.Joe. Hope the prequel is better than the previous one.If you are looking for something fun and good actions, this movie is worth to watch, somehow.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
228,ftyl,"When all else fails, they dress up in bondage gear and walk in slow motion...",3,5 August 2009,"I like Stephen Sommers. Theoretically. I caught Deep Rising on video (yes VHS!) many moons ago and, apart from being shocked by the body melting effects, really enjoyed it. The film found the right balance between ridiculousness and thrills and stuck to it. Sommers' next, 1999s The Mummy struck that balance just as well, with a more kid friendly slant and was a near perfect summer action adventure, especially considering the gut wrenching disappointment that was The Phantom Menace. And then, with The Mummy Returns, the cracks began to show... Sommers likes effects, this has always been clear and in his early films it could be considered a virtue, particularly in his fantastical re imagining of The Mummy tale. The sequel barely managed to keep its head above the flood of CG assisted smoke and mirrors and the knock on effect was to create more and more fanciful images. This reached its supposed peak with the unintentional horror show that was 2004s Van Helsing - with much of the running time composed of terribly animated, wire swinging sequences which defied logic, physics and good sense. Well, with G.I. Joe, Sommers has topped even that frustrating CG fest. Pretty people in incredibly, perhaps dangerously, tight clothing do all manner of unlikely things in G.I. Joe. You've seen some of them in the trailer and in small doses they seem like fun but the reality is that, over two hours, it just creates a vicious, all encompassing boredom. So their suits make them more or less indestructible - how interesting. When did filmmakers forget that putting heroes in situations with absolutely no danger just neuters the whole experience. There is no vicarious thrill if we don't even slightly believe they could be hurt whilst jumping through a Parisian LUAS. And speaking of tentative Irish connections, there is a moment in this film where a token, shockingly unfunny black man realises his futuristic fighter jet has no firing controls. Then his colleague suggests that it might respond to voice commands. In Celtic. Cue Marlon Wayans murdering the pronunciation at 30,000 feet. And its not even played for laughs. You couldn't make this crap up. The story is a mess of two many characters and blatant, on the nose exposition which makes the biggest mistake possible in a fantasy film - it never establishes the rules. As such, the audience is lost in a wildly vacillating tone which shifts from spastic humour to ultraviolence and small children beating the crap out of each other in seconds. The latter scene transplants a rough and ready kitchen fight scene into one involving children no older than 12. If Bruce Willis is barely dodging blades, fire and saucepans in a kitchen it is exhilarating. Here is just feels vaguely sinister and more than a little off-putting. For what its worth, Channing Tatum seems to have potential as a leading man. Sienna Miller makes next to no impression, particularly when set against the genuinely stunning and surprisingly effective Rachel Nichols. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Christopher Eccleston battle with shockingly awful versions of their actual accents (why?!) and Dennis Quaid smirks a lot in that way which makes him look like a stroke victim. The Paris sequence comes closest to making sense (as there is a clearly defined goal) and is almost engaging, though overlong and the final act borrows at first amusingly, then shamelessly from the end of Star Wars. Just transpose Arctic water for space and you can almost see the Death Star. Bottom line - forget the reviews filtering through the net and go see The Hurt Locker instead. Its the best action film I've seen in years.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
229,KaiOlaf,Crash! Boom!

230,marc242,Better than expected - Thumbs up,8,12 August 2009,"GI JOE is almost like a homage to 60s and 70s James-Bond Movies with all the gadgets and larger than life villains. Marlon Wayans was a little bit misplaced I must admit, but he was mainly there for some comic relief, which is OK. But he is not believable as a bad-ass marine or something like that, not for a second. The main action set-piece is of course the Battle of Paris (which was shot in the Czech Republic, btw), the accelerator suits rock, even if they aren't really from the JOE Universe of Gadgets.Everyone who expects this to be exactly like the cartoons will not like it, I'm afraid. It has more similarities to 60s James Bond / modern X-MEN trilogy than the old 80s Saturday morning cartoon. The production design reflects that. Good guys and villains alike are mostly dressed in black leather and rubber. Thats sometimes hard to watch in night time scenes. But anyway, its definitely a good roller-coaster ride. Better than Transformers 2, which was a bit too disjointed and cluttered. GI JOE has fast pacing, some nice character moments, corny but not atrocious dialogue, and entertains all the way.THE GOOD: Awesome Pacing, great production design, Insane action scenes, Snake Eyes, The BaronessTHE BAD: Marlon Wayans, some shoddy, rushed CGI Work in some scenes.

231,ColonelFaulkner,Bringing toys to real life.....not.,4,9 August 2009,"I'm no GI Joe guru or fanatic and never had any of the toys but I have to say I was looking forward to this movie without ever expecting it to be anything special. After seeing 'GI Joe' I have to describe it as a little bit disappointing and seemingly pointless (other than perhaps as a money spinner). The film was watchable for the most part but devoid of any real emotion or suspense (and not without trying).Taking a children's action figure and making a real life film out of it might be a good idea, but still presenting those characters on screen as two dimensional toys devoid of any real depth or character should not have have been (and probably wasn't) the idea. The film contains so much CGI and animation that I watched it wondering why they hadn't just done the whole thing in computer animation, including the characters.It's yet another example of a film and possibly director who doesn't seem to understand how so much more of something, too much in fact can really add up to less at the finish line. It's full of action, action and more action, but on such a scope and scale as to overdo it. It is concentrated on the fantastical and illogical (including the technology) to the point of absurdity in places and as a result it lacks many of the other things it required to really make the grade.It's not short of inspiration from a few other movie scenes either and more than once I was reminded of seeing a very similar scene in a different movie. This project had plenty of merit but I must suggest it ended up in the hands of the wrong guy. I will say that my boy loved it and gave it 10/10 so it will undoubtedly appeal to a much younger audience, younger than it's rating I suggest, a kids movie but with plenty of violence. I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it at all costs, but if you happen to miss it you've not missed a whole lot; a shame really.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
232,cm_anon76,Painful to watch,4,7 August 2009,"George Lucas once said that ""a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing"". This movie is a perfect example of that. Each special effect is painful to watch as it reinforces the fact that 95% of this movie just isn't interesting.There is some good acting in this movie, mostly from the villains. The moments of good acting make watching the meaningless special effects even more painful.I wouldn't even call this an action movie. It's more of a disaster movie. It consists mostly of one group of people blowing up another group of people. Instead of heroes and villains this movie is full of cowards with big guns.Some of the acting was really bad. Watching Dennis Quaid as General Hawk was an interesting as watching a corpse.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
233,RoadSideAssistance,Decent Summer Blockbuster,6,19 March 2011,"GI JOE: Rise of the Cobra is a film based on the action figures, comics, and television series. The basic premise of the film is a sort of cat and mouse chase to recover a very deadly weapon that uses nanotechnology. I wont go any further into the plot, but expect numerous twists and turns. The audience is definitely kept on the edge of their seat as various individuals and/or situations are not what they seem at first.The movie itself gives you non-stop action for the entirety of the film. If you're one of those types that can't stand slow parts or over the top drama this is your film. The film takes you everywhere, and I literally mean that. You're treated to various countries, aerial scenes, underwater scenes and witness some devastation in great detail along the way. The CGI is top notch and is used well to stage the scenes.What the movie seems to lack is direction. I felt like the producers jammed in WAY too many scenes and flashbacks. Some seemed necessary for the story but others just got in the way. It seems like they tried to dive into everyone's backstory a little too much, and the audience somewhat struggled imo (considering the average rating/reviews) to catch up to speed.The actors seemed to do well with the material they had but it was quite obvious the producers were going for big explosions and special effects. No one performance really stood out. I felt Sienna Miller basically carried the whole film. Dennis Quaid didn't seem like he had much to do.Overall a decent Friday night movie if you want to eat some popcorn and turn your mind off for 2 hours. 6/10.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
234,MoronUnited,Pure Enjoyment,9,8 August 2009,"One of the most iconic franchises in American history, G.I. Joe has been inspiring the minds of the American youth for decades. As a kid, I played with the figures, spending hours upon hours setting up war scenes in the living room, using all of the furniture as the terrain for the battlefield I had planned out in my head. Between the comic books and TV show, there was just no denying that G.I. Joe was absolutely awesome. Now, a live-action movie based on the franchise had yet to be done.......until now. Is it the summer blockbuster moviegoers will flock to, or just a miserable action mess? Evil has shown its hideous face on earth and the G.I. Joe organization refuses to let it prevail. Albeit simple, how much of a plot do you really need? Sure, there are a variety of characters each with their own dilemmas and whatnot, but nobody gives a crap about that. We went to the theater to see some spectacular action, and thankfully, that is just what the film has given audiences. The action sequences are enormous spectacles that just burst with excitement on the screen. Not only are the action sequences terrific, but there are just so many of them that it's mesmerizing. Cars flipping over, explosions in public places......it's absolutely crazy. The creativity in which these action scenes are created with also adds to the entertainment factor. Audiences have seen explosions and action sequences thousands of times in movies, but here, everything feels exciting and new to the point where it is truly refreshing. Also, even with a PG-13 rating, the action scenes don't feel cut and make audiences feel cheated like with many PG-13 action movies that are cut-down for the kiddies.Simply put, this is the way CGI should be used in movies. Instead of relying on CGI to create the movie from scratch, the creators used CGI as a tool to further enhance G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. This is not like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen in which everything is a jumbled mess of computer images vomiting across the screen. In G.I. Joe, everything has a distinct shape, making everything appear very flashy and sophisticated. Sure, some brief clips here and there may appear to be a tad bit rushed, but these are in very small numbers as the rest of the movie is just a feast for the eyes. The machines are sleek, powerful and edgy, and everything maintains just the right balance between serious and silly. Too much silliness and the movie feels cheap and crappy, and trying to hard to be serious leads to unintentional hilarity in which nobody is willing to believe what is happening. The balance is perfect, though, and everything just really works.As far as the acting is considered, these are not Academy Award winning performances, but that's mainly due to the nature of the script as opposed to amount of talent each actor has. Dennis Quaid works surprisingly well as General Hawk, and it really seemed like he was having a good time filming the movie, which in turn helps audiences further enjoy it. Other than that, the only real person that I must mention is a completely random appearance by Brendan Fraser. He doesn't serve much of a purpose in any way, but it's great to see him in an entertaining movie for a change. (Please Brendan, go back to being awesome. Please?).G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra may not be a perfect movie, but it's just so enjoyable and fun that everything else is irrelevant. Many people were skeptical right from the early announcement that the movie would be live-action, but I can safely say that after all the anticipation and speculation, the movie was worth the wait. It's a refreshing action movie that celebrates its subject matter with plenty of the famous lines being said in the movie, and it just knows how to have a good time. Definitely check this one out in theaters since the spectacle it produces on the big screen is fantastic. And now you know that you should see G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra........and knowing is half the battle.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
235,wikipediacabal,Brainless in the finest tradition of GI Joe properties,5,15 February 2015,"I was ten years old when the GI Joe cartoon came on back in the 80s and I thought it was great back then. When I watched this reboot, my first reaction was that it has no respect for plausibility or physics. There are many examples but one of the worst was the ballistic missiles. Marlon Wayans steals some kind of SR-71 knockoff Cobra plane and proceeds to chase and shoot down two ICBMs.Stupid, right? Ridiculous in several different ways? That's what I thought until I happened to rewatch one of the 1985 cartoons: ""Red Rocket's Glare."" In the cartoon, a ballistic missile is about to launch from California to Washington, DC. Roadblock, one of the GI Joes jumps onto the missile to disarm it. The Crimson Twins are in hot pursuit and they also jump on. The missile launches with three guys on top of it and they hang on.Flint and Lady Jay are in an F-14 flying around. Someone radios to them that this particular rocket has launched. So they say ""On our way"" and the afterburners light up, naturally allowing the jet to catch the ballistic missile.The missile has apparently gone up as high as it's going to go and come down again with Roadblock and the two Cobra guys hanging onto it, still fist fighting and exchanging quips. Flint then shoots a sidewinder at the flying missile and somehow it knocks the missile warhead off, instead of exploding itself. Then the missile luckily lands in the Potomac and everyone is OK.My point is, the dumbest and most unbelievable stuff from the movie pales in comparison to how stupid everything was on the TV show. Actually they cleaned it up a lot in terms of plausibility. You think nanomites are dumb? In that particular show I discussed, Destro has invented something called a photon disintegrator that fits in a backpack and makes a whole city disappear. And he is going to use them to destroy every capital city unless every country surrenders their nation to Cobra. That's it! No further explanation! When this is the source material, it's impossible to criticize the movie for being implausible. It might help to watch some of the old cartoons to recalibrate your sense of what is just too stupid.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

237,AlbusDumbledore,Very enjoyable.,7,12 November 2010,"Very enjoyable in a comic book sense.Although the efforts of the GI team to stop Cobra destroying the Eiffel Tower seemed to consist of them ploughing through Parisian rush hour traffic in a trail of destruction. And the Eiffel Tower was still destroyed. By Cobra.Didn't we witness a similar scenario in the opening scenes (I think) of Team America: World Police?I bet those Parisians heaved a sigh of relief.Anyway Christopher Eccleston was great as always. A modern day Peter Cushing, the Tenth Doctor (Doctor Who) effortlessly added a touch of authenticity to proceedings.Incidentally, Peter Cushing has also played a film version of The Doctor.",G.I.

238,DarioTheSweeper,A good movie.,10,9 October 2021,"I played with the toy figures as a child, so this movie was a must. I am very happy with what I saw.The G. I. Joe soldiers fight the bad Cobra terrorists. I imagined it differently when it comes to a movie, but I'm still very satisfied. Channing Tatum plays the main role, by the way, he is known from the movie Step up. Ray Park plays a ninja named Snake Eyes. He's definitely known to Star Wars fans. The fights are well done and the story is very good. I can not follow the bad comments of the haters. I enjoy seeing this movie on screen!To come to the conclusion I have to say that this is a movie for real G. I. Joe fans. I can't force anyone to watch this movie, but I liked it.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
239,jaeelbooks,Action-Packed Fun,8,9 October 2020,"First of all, shame on Channing Tatum for speaking as disparagingly about this film as he did. Even though he was signed to three of these films, I don't blame the production company from offing him in the sequel. 'G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra' is an action-packed and often humorous film that pays good homage to the cartoons and comics of days long past, while bringing them into our modern world. Marlon Wayans is a highlight of the film, and in truth, he is the film's real American hero. The production studio missed its mark by not bringing him back for the sequel. Dennis Quaid, who took his role by urging from his son, does a great job as the leader of the Joes, and the film is literally nonstop action. What more could anyone want? I have always been a 'true' fan of G.I. Joe, ever since I was a a little kid. I watched every cartoon, read every comic book, had every toy... The Only thing that could have made this better for me would have been Sergeant Slaughter. It is visually stunning, well-acted, and incredibly filmed. There are a lot of haters out there as far as this first installment of the franchise is concerned. To them, I say this: Go back to your source material, and if you know it's based on a toy or a cartoon or a comic book and that's not your thing, don't watch it.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
240,tasev1,More than I bargained for,8,12 August 2009,"I went to see this film at a cheap theatre, just wanting to see some special effects and not expecting to see a very good flick, especially since I used to watch the cartoons when I was a kid. My expectations were low.I was surprisingly blown away by this guy-flick-action-movie a la old school appeal film!. Why? Because this film had an element of every imaginable idea of military, science-fiction, fighting action wawa-wiwa technology my head has always imagined and wished would be true. And they PUT IT TOGETHER WELL. How well? I'm a realist, so I always look at believability, continuity, factual errors, etc.... I didn't even notice, let alone care about realism. It didn't matter because I was having too much fun. I'm a sci-fi buff, so I saw many points undoubtedly inspired by everything from Star Trek and Terminator, to Fallout 3 and Sea Quest DSV to name a few. This film was a playground, and it had everything. Sex appeal, technology, martial arts, fighting on ground, in the air, and underwater. James Bond would poo his pants.I await a sequel, and hopefully a game release too! If you want to be entertained, and to see a good action movie, this is a good bet. I had more regret with Transformers than this one. Don't be too critical - just remember how cheesy those mindless action flicks of the 70's and 80's were, yet so popular in pop culture.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
241,GloriousGooner,Boring flashfest,4,19 March 2010,"The saving grace of GI Joe is that it comes in under 2 hours. Unfortunately it still gets tedious: really seriously boring. The one set piece in Paris is the relative highlight yet it quickly becomes indistinguishable amongst the sea of explosions and fast action that is so overdone, so over the top, and without any hint of humour (except Wayans) or letup that watching it all becomes a chore in the final act. The bases were done better in Bond films, the action better in every other action film and the slow mo was done better in the Matrix; there aren't any discernible characters and the bloated story takes way too long getting to the big letdown of a denouement that we're all waiting for. An instantly forgettable splash of commercial pulp excess. Mortal Combat with bigger bangs.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
242,Digory,My butt ached on this one,5,15 August 2009,"Just after Transformers' sweep at the box office comes another movie from the Hasbro Toy Company. For those who've seen the cartoons, read the comics, or collected the toys, it might rock your world but I wouldn't count on it. If you're looking forward to see a movie about real soldiers, you might want to pass. If you are expecting a superhero movie, you might also want to wait for this to come out on DVD or your favorite movie channel. If you wish to see a typical action movie with all the cliché moments and cheesiness, this might be for you (note the helping verb ""might""). G.I. Joe is nothing more than your average action-adventure flick with plenty of the usual. The story in this film isn't something new either and they don't even give a shot at making it appear new. The ""action"" effects in G.I. Joe doesn't measure up to my standards. The movie felt so long because of the dialogue which I didn't bother to listen to. There are a few cool scenes though but that just doesn't compensate the typicality of this movie.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
243,train1077,"Good action, with a silly love story...",4,25 November 2009,"If it was not for the very silly love story between Baroness and Duke, the too unrealistic flirting between Ripcord and Scarlett, this would be an otherwise excellent action movie.. But unfortunately these two things, take up too much of the movie and makes it very annoying. No one knows that Storm Shadow and Snakeeyes are brothers, that is acceptable. But the emotionally connection would do, that Duke never should be accepted in this mission. Considering that he, well actually all the time, ruins the missions. Ripcord I think, is supposed to be the comic in the movie, well honestly, it does not work.There is only really one cgi effect that is not worth looking at because they look too fake, otherwise visually the movie is nice to look at. I am talking about Scarlett on the motorcycle. If you want action it is a worth the time. I would not recommend it, but not tell people not to watch it.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
244,sinsro,"Another IP gets a movie, and pulls it off with some dignity",6,8 August 2009,"I heard of G.I. Joe before, but in my country it was never popular, so I had no idea about what to expect. Which turned out to be no problem, as the movie is telling the story of how it all began, with the introduction of the G.I. team which is the secret protector of Earth who steps in with amazing technology and the best of the best soldiers when everything else has failed. It's the story of how Joe found his way into this team, to become the legendary G.I. Joe.Other characters, evil and good, are also introduced through a series of brief flashbacks. You will be pretty educated about G.I. Joe and his arch enemy, the Cobra, when leaving the theater.To make it even less hardcore, they also added some romance in there, so it's safe to bring your date. I went with a female friend, and she liked it at least. But don't worry, the romance never gets in the way of the action. And that's what the movie is all about, action and special effects. It's not about the story or good acting.I guess the movie is what you'd expect to appear if Transformers 2 and The Day the Earth Stood Still fell in love and made a baby. It has swarms of destructive Nano bots, men in robot suits, lots of action, some romance with tomboy girls and pretty much gives the same feel. Looks more like its dad Transformers 2 though.I never found myself caught up in the movie at any point since it's never exciting as you always know what will happen before the characters in the movie figures it out, and it has no surprising plot turns in any way. It's just a long exercise in CGI-assisted action scenes, with a humorous tone to it. It will give you a few laughs.If you are picky about special effects you might catch a few scenes where the graphics looks pretty fake, which is in fact more rare than the opposite these days, but it still is pretty good eye candy.It's a movie that is soon forgotten, but which is still entertaining enough to be hypnotized to after a long stressful week. Remember to turn off your brain before watching and you'll be fine.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
245,murrayspeer,The first half is bad but tolerable; then it gets ludicrous,4,5 November 2019,"There was a point about one third of the way through this movie where I found myself thinking it might not be so bad after all. Yes, the dialogue and the ""acting"" were atrocious. Yes, there seemed to be no actual global awareness in the script. (Cancer has apparently been cured; this is considered so insignificant next to the military applications of the technology that it becomes a throw-away line.) But the plot itself was shaping up to be reasonably strong.The movie centers on Marine Special Ops officer ""Duke"" and his pal ""Ripcord"". There's never any indication whether these are nicknames or real names, and apparently no one cares. But that's fine. Their unit has responsibility for delivering some new experimental weapons from the developer's manufacturing site to a NATO base. They are ambushed by a third party, commanded by an exotic leather-clad beauty called ""The Baroness"", who seems to have a history with Duke. The marines are rescued by GI JOE, a top secret international commando unit into which they are quickly inducted.(Spoilers)Let's leave aside for a second the two force-fed and under-nourished romantic storylines, and the ""acting"" of ""actors"" Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans. The plot so far is interesting, possibly even compelling. Who does Baroness represent? What is the connection between her and Duke? How is her organization related to JOE? Is a massively over-equipped and trigger-happy group of self-obsessed hotshots really a good use of funds? Compelling stuff, if written properly.Unfortunately, it was not. The answers to these questions are either simplistic and trite, or nonexistent. The first of them was answered before it arose, turning a plot ""twist"" into a plot ""plunk"".But still, if not compelling it was at least interesting. After all, so far we haven't been asked to swallow any preposterous notions. A single development - nanites - allowed for all of the brilliant technologies in the story. Until, that is, they extract a dead man's memories - in visual format - by sticking two knitting needles into his skull.At that point, the film shifts gear into ludicrous speed.For instance, the JOES are attempting to prevent the destruction of the Eiffel Tower and the resulting deaths of hundreds of civilians. So they carve a path of destruction through the middle of Paris, causing the deaths of untold dozens of civilians. Okay, you could say that in the balance it would have worked out. But they don't even request the evacuation of the tower. It just doesn't occur to them as they are rampaging through the city streets, delighting in their own skill and power, to simply phone it in. So when the tower is destroyed, the hundreds of civilians still die. But at least all of the JOES are okay.Then they're arrested by French police, and the President of the USA has to make a phone call to get them released. So, we're asked to believe that of the 38 countries that support the GI JOE unit, France is NOT one of them? Is this some BS American dig at France that I'm not equipped to understand? Or just sheer idiocy?Nevertheless, I would be willing to overlook that gaping plot hole. But the hits just keep on coming. Ripcord flies from Moscow to Washington in about six minutes. He says he's flying Mach 6. Mach 6 is approximately 4600 mph. The distance between the two cities is about 4900 miles. In other words, it would take a little over an hour to make that flight. Not six minutes.Then, the commander of the JOES, General ""Hawk"", leaves their secret Egyptian base with the entire squadron to attack their enemy who is hiding under the polar ice cap. They arrive minutes later in a submarine. Yes, you heard right. They travelled from Egypt to the North Pole in a matter of minutes. In a submarine.And the icing on the cake, from the ""Is our children learning?"" category: the enemy blows up the ice cap while making an escape, and the JOES have to hurry to get out from under the sinking ice before it crushes them. Yes. You heard right. The sinking ice. Why does this ice sink, you ask? Well... um... isn't that what ice does? Like, when you put it in your drink it si-... um...But boy were there a lot of characters to make action figures out of! And sexy shots of the Baroness and the token woman on the JOE team, ""Scarlet""! And a greater variety of vehicles than you could produce in a single toy line! And explosions! Lots of explosions.Just not enough to cover the absolute failure of ""acting"", plot, and storytelling. 4/10Still, at least it was better than Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
246,DaleP1979,Had Low Expectations. Loved The Movie!,8,11 August 2009,"OK, I had almost every GI Joe toy growing up. I also watched the cartoon. Being a young kid during the 80's was awesome. As far as I am concerned, the toys and the cartoons from that era are the best. However, after first seeing the preview for GI Joe, and seeing that they now wore mech suits...... I had very low expectations for the movie. Just figured they were trying yet another way to milk money off of the remainder of 80's cartoons/ re-imaging.However, I have to say, even though there was a little cheesiness to it, I really enjoyed this movie. This movie is based off a toy/cartoon/comic book. It isn't like other comics that could be deep, or thought provoking. It was always mainly about action, cool weapons, good guys and bad guys, getting caught and then escaping. This movie is just that. A action movie from start to finish. Has enough of a storyline to make it from beginning to end, but is mainly about the action. It doesn't give you a lot of back story to the characters. You do get a couple flashbacks, just so you know who people are, and how they are connected. But this isn't really an origins movie. I think some people were expecting some kind of epic movie experience. This movie is not that! This is a popcorn/ summer action movie/ and a way to relive some childhood memories for those of us who grew up watching the cartoon, or playing with the toys.For those of you complaining about plot holes, and/or unbelievable science......... come on!!! What about the original cartoons was so believable??? This is fantasy!!!I will admit though, although I did like the movie, some of the special effects were not that good. There were a few times during the movie where I saw something that just looked too fake, and I was like ... ""that is just cheesy"". But overall, it was a fun movie. Definitely not one I regret going to see.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
247,zahmed_1970,This Movie is a Joke,1,7 November 2009,"This Movie Truly Sucks, its a Joke. I watched it on DVD and just kept nodding my head. Very Start of the movie, the inactive warhead were supposed to be so sensitive that pot holes on the road were to be avoided, yet the Weaponized ones later in the movie went through complete destruction of the vehicle yet they survive. The manufacturing company MARS supposed to be playing with both sides, would be so easy to pass the warheads directly to the enemy but the movie went through the elaborate plot of first giving the weapons to US and then let the enemy steal them... What a Joke, would be so easy just to give it to them. The G.I. Joe base in Eygpt is a Fortress yet the so easily breached with no alarms nothing. Entire City is built under water yet no one knows about it. Twp missiles were fired both in opposite direction, one for Moscow the other for Washington DC, Marlon Wayans destroys the one for Moscow just few seconds before the Impact which is fine but suddenly appears above Washington to destroy the other, no mention of WARP Speed, even Superman could not do this, he had to make the planet go back in time to prevent it.

248,mbkalkan,"A bit of this, a bit of that...",5,14 August 2009,"James Bond meets Star Wars meets Transformers meets Mortal Kombat. Action in, dialogues out. Adrenaline in, common sense out. SFX in, acting out. OK, this IS a summer blockbuster -and with some cool scenes in it, if I may add- but it still could have been crafted much much better anyway, and in a more original way at that. For reference, please look/watch: Star Trek (2009). Apart from the rebooting thing and the criticisms it received, it was as a blockbuster much more balanced across its elements, and was far more enjoyable than this latter example. In G.I. Joe, on the other hand, action and suspense and SFX is used to bloat out all the major plot holes and bad dialogues and lousy personal interactions. Still, all in all, this one is still better than transformers: revenge of the fallen, and the action sequences still make this flick somewhat -and at certain times- fun to watch.",G.I.

249,datdudesketch,A real American ZERO!,5,8 August 2009,"Okay, so clearly I did not give this film a zero, because it's not all that bad for non fans. But, if you're a G.I. Joe aficionado like myself looking to time travel for at least 120 minutes of your life... forget it. The Rise of Cobra has so many pros and cons it's hard to truly shoot it down or give it praise and I'll tell you why.The pros: I'm sure most fans are completely psyched to finally see a live action battle between Storm Shadow (the white ninja) and his sword brother Snake Eyes (the black ninja) on the big screen. Truthfully we get two great scenes in all of its bloody ninja goodness, so there's no need to complain there. Also, Sienna Miller delivers sexiness and vicious intent as the Baroness. She's so hot in that leather you'd almost go into a trance right before she kills you. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the shining jewel of this film. Yes, I said it. A lot of the fans I've heard from scoffed at his casting, but he proved them wrong as I knew he would! Joseph delivers a great voice and commanding presence as Cobra Commander that could not be topped. Finally, there's some awesome nostalgic elements to smile at like the ""Yo Joe!"" call, ""Knowing is half the battle"", and even a glimpse at the USS Flagg which was the G.I. Joe's aircraft carrier. Unfortunately, that's where it ends folks.The cons: Sure you get a healthy dose of ninja action, but the back story between Storm and Snake is completely rewritten. It doesn't have any connection as to why they are now in the G.I. Joe and (ahem) MARS organizations! Is it just random coincidence? All of the back stories are changed and not one of them is completely believable, so don't think for a second that you non-fans would like what they did. I won't go into details because I'd be here all night. Sienna Miller looked good, but god... what a horrible Baroness. Remember I mentioned vicious intent? That's all it is, intent. She never really does any damage. Speaking of damage... there's just way too much guys. Really.So that's how I see it. The film is a great one night stand, but she lacks the intelligence and potential for a second date. If you're looking to see a bunch of loud explosions, skin tight black rubber and goofy one-liners than this is the movie for you. Don't expect to come out of the theater reviewing all the cools scenes with your buddies, because you won't remember any of them. It's a wham bam thank you ma'am.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
250,sweetlittlepie,"Good special effects, bad storyline",4,19 August 2009,"Okay...How do I even begin to name all the things that went wrong with this film. Okay first I'll start by saying it's pretty bad, not Dragonball Evolution bad, it's actually tolerable, but it's still bad.First they got they got the storyline completely wrong. The Baroness isn't romantically linked to Duke. She has always been faithful to Destro. Snake Eyes and Scarlett are suppose to be romantically linked, but that was thrown out of the window. Oh and then they killed Cover Girl! What else...The flashbacks were pretty much pointless, personally I found the Snake Eyes/Storm Shadow flashback to be tedious and infantile. I think they're rivalry could have been explained without having to waste so much time. Sienna Miller was worse than usual. I have nothing against her personally, but she does nothing for me. I've seen better acting from a cardboard cutout. Channing Tatum is mediocre at best. The rest of the cast is okay. The best performances were pulled off by Christopher Eccleston who plays Destro, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Cobra Commander.There were some scenes that were so cheesy I almost burst out laughing in the theater, but I contained myself.Also I know the film has some sci-fi elements, but still there were some things that were too outrageous. One thing that bothered me is that the Baroness' husband is a Baron who is also a scientist. Correct me if I'm wrong, but most people who are related to royalty and have a formal title don't work. I mean has anyone ever heard of a Baron scientist! I thought not. Maybe I'm just picky, but for some reason that really bothered me.The Cobra Commander storyline is again wrong as well. He is not related to the Baroness. He wasn't acquainted with Duke, he was not a soldier, but a used car salesman.They basically took the original storyline and crapped on it. But I don't expect much from Stephen Sommers. Nothing against the guy personally, but he has no real creative imput in any of his projects. I think his best film to date has been the first Mummy flick. And even the Mummy wasn't that good. He is just one of those directors who's specialty is to make summer popcorn movies with stereotypical and dated plot lines.I guess the only thing positive I have to say is that the film delivers in the special effects area. That's about it.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

252,f_mckissack,Good dumb but unremarkable fun,6,2 November 2009,"GI:Joe Rise of Cobra is a good dumb fun action film that offers plenty of bang for your buck. Forget plots, character development or plausibility. What this film offers, and it offers it in droves, is high impact thrills and action set pieces that every kid in their sandpit could only dream of creating.However, even though the film appears to cater for the easily pleased, action saturated market of juvenile kids and young adults in denial of their age, the film falters at various stages, both on a technical level, and also as a functional and engaging film. While he is no doubt a talented and successful actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt is absolutely terrible as 'The Doctor.' His voice is off, the performance is stale, and it seems that he is completely uninterested in the material. A shame. Sienna Miller's Baroness offers some sweet sex appeal, but her character goes through one of the most unnecessary changes of heart i have ever seen. It is almost as though the film is afraid to keep its baddies for fear of scaring the little ones. Finally, while they may be passable when dealing with action figurines, some of the character names (Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow etc...) just sound silly when spoken by actual actors in a live action film. This is made worse by the fact that most of the characters are so shallow that the only way the audience can get to know them is through these campy combat names.Some of the action sequences also lose their intensity. This is in part because of the frenetic, almost incomprehensible nature of some of the larger battles, but also because it is all so obviously CGI at times. It is hard to care for the action (as pretty as it may be) when there is little to no emotional investment in the characters and when it is clear that at no point in the making of the film was any actual person in any actual danger.But that is to be pretentious with a film that is merely aiming to entertain. And it succeeds. Worth watching on a big screen with big speakers and a big bucket of popcorn.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

He and I both loved to see these action flicks that didn't require a lot of thought to enjoy. We just enjoyed the explosions, gunfire, improbable acrobatics, and all that. I thought about him all during this movie, and it brought a big smile to my face. Growing up, I was a little too old for the G.I.

I generally don't like movies like this but I don't hate them either so this might be a realistic review. When the movie started it blew me away, I actually went ""WOW!"" cos it surprised me positively. I like the cast, but then again I'm not a fan of GI Joe so I don't really know what the characters should be like, still I think the actors did a decent job.Most of the film is made in modern action sci-fi style and the scenes are packed with flawless CGI and action as they should be in a movie like this.So far I would give this movie a 7, but...Durring this movie I noticed 3 HUGE mistakes the movie makers made.1. Our Joes wearing the super fast suits run after a car, jump through a train, but can't catch up with 2 bad guys one of which is a 5'4"" girl running on foot?!2. One of the Joes gets tomato sauce spilled on his mask so he can't see anymore?! I mean, If those are super freaking' suits that can jump through walls, wouldn't the scientists who built them invent a way to clear that freaking' glass?3. Ice doesn't sink people, it floats, so You cant blow the polar cap expecting the ice to sink! My god! RETARDED!Some parts of the movie, like the three listed above, made me mad but I still think this movie is better then AVP 2 etc, so I'm gonna give it a weak 4.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
255,neighborlee,Excellent movie considering the source material.,10,28 October 2009,"After having seen this film, right after watching transformers latest movie, I am appalled to see critics here with their noses in the air, and obviously drowning in their own misplaced lack of objectivity.I've seen far too many reviews here suggesting there was no plot , bad acting ad nauseam, but honestly I think its jealousy from not having gotten the part(s), because the only bad acting I see so far is insincere outrage from expectations in the negative.How much more of a plot do you need anyway , what movie did it for you and what comparisons are you drawing between the two ? THe effects were incredible and the pacing was never without thrills and they did it all without resorting to over the top boring , unnecessary and undesireable plot stealing gore; so if you didn't like this movie then don't blame the movie, or even high expectations but instead maybe your confusion came from trying to watch the movie and having your thoughts betray you with visions of that last bad tomatoes experience .I've seen the scores from this and transformers2 and many other movies that were otherwise great in many ways, but overall scores held down very likely by people that would never have gone to see the movie to begin with and just wanted to come find fault and minimize, so at the end of the day I say don't go into a movie without knowing something about what you'll be seeing and be honest with that expectation and instead of expecting the movie to necessarily 'obey' the law of physics accept it for what it is. It's a movie , where you are supposed to be whisked away to a fantasy realm ( unless based purely on fact ) where the idea is to have some fun, dream, and maybe discover inspiration to make this a better place for everyone.I thought about the score initially, and while I wasn't completely happy about some acting honestly, overall I could not hold this movie down on that one small flaw because it delivered on its intentions of drawing us into a fantasy world where bad people do bad things, good people becomes heroes, and at the end , life was renewed by two people who didn't give up on each other and all was becoming right with the world again.",G.I.

256,angelocrus,"An amateur review, subjective too",3,13 August 2009,"Too noisy, with a little element in it. The story, hmmph a little awkward, stereotype. There's no single good actor in this piece of something, Mr. Quaid is just there to be seen, nothing special, Mr. Tatum is too pretty to play the part, Mr. Wayans - that's his element okay... too typical for me. Everything's too typical.Mr. Fraser's appearance is somewhat okay, cool, he's cool. Special effects are too much... a little moderation and a little time for the viewers to breathe will be good. Some stunning effects though, and cool ideas put in those visuals but it somehow didn't make me feel anything special... as I said, everything's too typical and ordinary.I guess that what makes this piece a little bit not too cool is it's inability to capture the imagination of it's viewers. Faces are there to be seen, effects are made to be admired, hmmm, story maybe thought to be great but really, a little amateur and immature for me. Take from an amateur guy like me.I thought I was gonna watch this film two times but I can only watch it once and I already know there's no heart in this. That's actually the reason why this is not going to be as successful as others... because scenes were made from elements... not from deep within. The result... lame.Every body has his own opinions right? That's for me.I checked the spoiler thing here because I still have no idea what's one.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
257,musings-morsels,Rise of Cr*p!,1,13 May 2010,"Paramount Pictures and Hasbro, whose previous collaboration was the worldwide blockbuster 'Transformers' join forces with Spyglass Entertainment for another extraordinary action-adventure 'G.I Joe' – that's what's being marketed globally for this new flick. But don't get your hopes up because if you're expecting an actual plot and a clever/humorous dialogue banter between well developed characters. You'd have more luck watching half way through a Disney Pixar film.The film was all action and that's it. Script, plot, the art of acting & characterisation was all completely f**ked! Not that the screenwriters and director Stephen Sommers thought any of these film techniques would help make the movie a little more bearable. They seem determined to mainly deliver one high-octane, heavily CGI-laden ultimately deadening effect.The film revolves around the idea of ""the Joes"" (not just the one all-American-hero G.I Joe) - now a massive underground secret service division with the best ops from all around the world cumulated into one unit. Right this is a seriously flawed foundation for the film to be base on since all I was asking throughout the film was, where's the funding coming from? Didn't anyone notice all their best soldiers disappearing? Why the hell are all these solders co-operatively turning their back on their own countries to work for America? .... Weren't any of these questions raised at all??? The government must all be f**ken stupid in the near future. I mean I'm all for good bullshit light entertaining actions films but there's only so much I can handle. And throwing in a whole heap of 'the Mummy' cast (Brendan Fraser, Arnold Vosloo & Kevin J. O'Connor) isn't going to help the film whatsoever except maybe jack the budget up to make it seem like a bigger blockbuster film.But hey! That's just my opinion.Don't take my word for it; catch it in cinemas if you want to experience the mind numbing – eye rolling – ear and brain damaging film while it's still available, because duds always get booted off the silver screens sooner than expected.

260,has_no_pseudonym,Was not good for what it was...,2,10 April 2011,"Sometimes you just want an action flick to watch: kill a little time, have something easy to watch while you're doing something else, something a bit stupid or silly to indulge in because it's fun. A guilty pleasure, if you will. I had very low expectations for this film, but well, it still didn't cut it. I have never been more disinterested in an action film. I gave up after 26 minutes...I thought I was an hour into the film. Supernova, which is just a bad movie, was able to hold my interest better.I would call the level of explosions and fight scenes hedonistic, but that would imply pleasure. There was nothing thrilling or suspenseful about any of the action I saw. It was just boring.I have nothing against Channing Tatum, but he was wooden and uninteresting. His emotions barely varied from scene to scene. Marlon Wayans, while relegated to the comedic non-hero role, was much more emotive, human and ultimately more likable. Dennis Quaid, who I admire, was horrible in this. It's like he dumbed down the quality of his acting to match the quality of the writing. I love Christopher Eccleston, but his Scottish accent was crap and I could barely stand it. I love Arnold Vosloo, but I couldn't watch more of this, even for him.This movie is so bland I don't even have the will to hate it, but it's so bad I'd rather rewatch Transformers than to watch 'G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra' in its entirety.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
261,amunetpallaton,"Meh, is about as good as it's gonna get.",4,9 August 2009,"I saw this on Saturday and I really can't remember too much about it which is not a good sign.This movie just didn't appeal to me at all and I grew up wanting my brother's GI Joes (to play with my barbies lol).The special effects were just OK, but the more they showed certain things, the longer we got to see just how not so great they actually were. Like the jets that the 2 main characters were picked up on. We got to see a 2 or 3 minute long 360 shot of it, and it just looked cheap and totally fake.The acting wasn't very good either. I'm not sure if it was just the material or what, but I was cringing throughout the movie at the campiness of it all.The movie as a whole felt like 1 loooooong drawn out far too long car chase scene. It's entertaining for the first couple of minutes, with the explosions and FX, and all of that, but then it gets very old very quickly.Am I looking forward to this movie coming out on DVD? Nope... not at all.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
262,chillyacademic,Haven't laughed so hard in ages,4,20 December 2009,"Like many others, I wasn't expecting much from this movie. And good thing too. It uses every futuristic action movie cliché in the book, the dialogue is so bad it becomes quite pathetic, the characters are very thinly written and poorly acted, the special effects are nothing to write home about, and you can guess most of the plot from a mile away.Yet this movie wasn't truly terrible. It had a good attempt at emotional involvement with the main protagonist/antagonist, considering how flat the other characters were, and the flashbacks were somewhat interesting.The biggest problem the movie suffers from is utter lack of inspiration. I realize G.I. Joe isn't the greatest source material but the entire movie is so corny, predictable, and unoriginal that it becomes impossible to take even slightly seriously. There are plenty of plot holes and character decisions that don't make any sense at all. The plot is built around the action scenes and convenience, and so it doesn't make sense on its own. It is also painfully obvious how hard they tried to keep the action PG-13.Channing Tatum was a robot, Sienna Miller was okay I suppose but her character just smirked all the time, and Marlon Mayans was lame. I didn't believe for a second that he was an actual soldier in an elite training program because he plain sucked as the bumbling sidekick. Dennis Quaid was wasted.I give this 4/10. Not particularly good or even passable, but not quite terrible.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
263,cheesymctaggert,Really Cheesy!!,6,20 December 2009,This film looked really promising and started that way too but then took a turn for the worse..The film is far too cheesy to be taken seriously from the really bad British accent to the massively advanced weapons they use to kill each other.It does have its good points such as the ninjas fighting and the two lead women look amazing (sienna miller and rachel nichols) and the cgi is really impressive..But for me its too childish and a bit of a boring story i think they could have done a lot better with the franchise.If your looking for a decent American action movie just watch iron man!!!!,G.I.

264,merlinsk,Not a film for GI JOE fans!,6,2 May 2019,"If this was any old action flick it would be good, and if you were not a fan of the 80s GI JOE (or Action Force in Europe) comics and cartoons you will probably thoroughly enjoy this film.The problem is this is marketed as a GI Joe movie, yet the filmmakers for whatever reasons, have pretty much completely disregarded the existing mythology, thereby alienating a large core fan base. It just doesn't seem to make sense to me!If the above paragraph seems petty to you, imagine some other examples; if the MCU had made Thor a Greek God instead of Norse, Iron Man a robot instead of a man in armour and the Hulk an alien, would the movies have been so successful? What if the rebooted Dr. Who had been made into a human mad scientist whose TARDIS was a dumpster? Or if in JJ Abram's Trek, Spock was Klingon? Answer to all, you just wouldn't do it!Yes, reboots play with, and tweak the existing mythologies which does in fact often improve things, franchises have to evolve to stay relevant, but there is tweaking and there's bastardising. So much has changed in this movie that it is no longer the GI Joe that the fans loved.I was, like many of those old enough to remember eagerly awaiting the arrival of the comic, thoroughly disappointed.Just a comment to those who have made an issue of the multicultural nature of the Joes here taking away from the ""Real American Hero"", well in the UK GI JOE was ""Action Force, International Heroes"" because in Europe we're sensible enough to know that America never saves the world alone, her successful wars are when she has allies (even the Revolutionary War before I get any ""Well we whupped your ass Limey"" comments) 😉. Anyway I can only assume that Hasbro were sensible enough to realise that the movie would be more successful internationally if the team was, in fact, international as was Action Force.Finally, what the hell is with the lips on Snake Eyes mask??",G.I.

I know you probably won't take my advice and this will spawn sequels but if even one person reads this and avoids this crap sandwich then I have done well. Please don't support Stephen Sommers. It says I need ten lines so in closing the movie is bad, the one good scene is the chase scene in Paris but it is ruined when Duke jumps into the helicopter stops the bomb and then instead of putting up a fight he flirts with Sienna Miller until the China man can crack his skull.

It has a terrible script and is poorly directed, but there is heaps of action to keep some interest. The budget is big but the result is less. It could have been a movie to rival Transformers 2, but sadly a French/USA feel production does not hit the mark. The most positive aspect are the countless action sequences which could be further picked at, but with the script and direction being so poor, they are the only saving grace. I do not hold much hope for the sequel but with a better script you never know it may surprise. Overall I would have preferred to watch Transformers 2 a second time than watch this.",G.I.

267,Knighthawk701,"Bad, worse, GI Joe",2,22 May 2011,"Now I am a fan of the comic and watched all of the animated series when I was a kid. So making a movie about it added a new dimension. Too bad it's one of the worst movies ever.I mean yeah there are some nice special effect. But they are so over the top it's just too much. The storyline is a complete disaster too. I won't comment on the acting since that is not that important to most action movies, but it's not even the worst on this movie.Things happen that are just too dumb to describe even. For instance, there is this case in which 4 missiles are stored. The bad guy activates a device in it to track the HQ of GI Joe and attacks it. After the attack some of the Joe's are walking down a corridor and one of them all of the sudden says: 'Mc Mullen activated the code to track us down'. I mean come on! The writers were just too lazy to think of something else.Talking about bad writing, like half the movie is a family-reunion. Okay subplot with the two ninja's on opposite sides is cool, but the part were the evil doctor unveils he is Rex, brother of the Baroness (ex-lover from Duke) is just too much.And why they even bother acquiring these warheads? Yeah they are powerful, but the bad guys have weapons that are even more powerful then any mega-bazooka or missile in the world! The Baroness (the only reason I gave the movie 2 stars!) fires a handgun and it takes apart half a roof. Why not just build a cannon-version of these guns? Ow wait they did but they attached it to their over-the-top base underwater so it's not the useful for world-domination purposes.There is a lot of CGI and it shows. Half of it looks made by some kids testing 3D Studio in a basement somewhere, while some other parts look quite nice, like the take off of the Night Raven jet at the Polarbase.Overall it's just too much over the top. I understand it's an action movie but the writers over do it. Could it be to impress the Transformers? Only one thing is sure, I was not impressed in any way...",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
268,mgayles2005,"""Knowing is half the battle""...well know this movie sucks",4,9 August 2009,"I am well aware that this movie is based on an 80's cartoon show, and a series of toys, but shouldn't the live action version evolve from it's predecessor? According to the director Steven Sommers, the answer is no. ""G.I Joe: Rise of Cobra"" is still a cartoon in terms of style, pacing and tone. The once animated characters are brought to life by stiff actors who still portray cartoon characters. There is non stop action, some of it is well made, and much of it is loaded with CGI effects that belong on a Playstation 2 game.The screenplay is made up on the fly, with predictable twists, the most basic exposition ever written, and dialog that mainly consists of bad one liners; these lines are so cheesy even Arnold Schwarzenegger would have too much pride and integrity to say them.The villain is named McCullen (or Destro to the fans). He's played with lackadaisical effort by Christopher Eccleston. McCullen comes from a long line of arms dealers who have history of selling to both sides during a conflict. In the opening scene McCullen demonstrates a missile weapon that can ceaselessly destroy entire cities with deadly nano technology. He is not selling these weapons to terrorists, he is actually selling them to our own American military, who hypocritically buy these weapons of mass destruction.It cost billions of dollars just to produce four of these weapons (which resemble green Nerf footballs) so of course they are safely shipped and protected by two lightly armed soldiers in a hummer (not a plane), driving through the woods at night. The real life terrorists wish the real military was this stupid. The bad guys show up and attempt to steal the weapon, until the good guys show up and stop them. The good guys (for reasons never explained) are known as G.I Joe. The two soldiers, Duke (Channing Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayons), are recruited into the organization that is so secret, if a member reveals his real name he is booted off of the team, even though all it takes to become a G.I Joe is less than a day of testing and training. Like I said earlier, the terrorists only wish the real military was this stupid.But it turns out that McCullen sent the bad guys to steal the weapons from the military that he sold them to in the first place. Why would he do such a thing? He wants to sell the weapon to the army and the terrorists. But such a weapon is so expensive he can only produce four of them, so he has to spend even more time, money, and man power just to steal the weapon back. And it appears that money is his only motivation. He even tells his top scientist that after his plans succeed he will be able to finance all of his research. But they clearly state that McCullen's company has produced almost all of the weapons technology on the planet. That would make McCullen trillions of dollars in profits. And did I mention that the enemy base is located in an underwater city? This base is so elaborate and complex it makes the city from ""Bioshock"" look like an aquarium. Once you can afford to build and operate an underwater city, money is no issue, even in this economy.And the underwater city is just one of the dozens of gadgets that upstage the humans. The movie becomes a two hour commercial for ""Hasbro"" toys, the US military, and ""The Sharper Image"". Since there are no characters to care about the props have to take center stage. But even the props upstage the props. It's impossible to care about a nano missile after you see the bad guys use a flying saucer type device to steal it. It's impossible to care about accelerator suits when you've seen a cloaking a suit, drills that can travel all across the world underground, and nano technology that turns average goons into invincible supermen. The movie becomes an any thing goes type of movie. If the Joe's needed a rocket that could fly to mars i'm sure they would have it.The action is non stop, and it's slightly satisfying, but it's impossible to care about any of it when the people involved can not die or be injured. They are constantly shot at, blown up, slashed, stabbed, beaten, and fall from deadly heights only to suffer minor scratches in the process. Flashbacks are shown to flesh out the characters, but even the flashbacks are just an excuse to show more action. With such cheesy acting and dialog I welcome things blowing up. There are few action scenes without CGI, and with such an expensive production you would expect the CGI effects to dazzle; most of the effects shots resembled the toys I assume Hasbro hoped to sell. Product placement at its finest.For a film that used the phrase: ""knowing is half the battle"", I found it unapologetically moronic. The only battle waged was against my own brain. One half of my grey matter said: ""stop noticing the flaws and like this movie!"", but that half wasn't strong enough to overtake the critical side that hated this movie from the very beginning. To be fair it's not the worst action movie of this summer by any means. It's not as plot less as ""Terminator Salvation"", and it's not as offensive as ""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"". It's only crime is being stupid, so stupid that it may de-evolve mankind into monkeys, just like that weapon from ""Super Mario Bros."". If a theater of monkeys could see this movie the chimppocalypse would soon begin.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
269,cchires,To Sum it Up in One Word: Fun!,7,3 September 2009,"To think analytically about 'G.I. Joe' is like looking for the meaning of life in a fortune cookie: Sure you could do it, but it's a waste of time. The film appears to have one goal which is to be the equivalent of a two hour roller-coaster ride and for the most part it succeeds.My expectations for this film were not high due to the fact that it wasn't previewed for critics (this usually is the sign of desperate marketing) and when the reviews starting pouring in, they were not pretty. But think for a minute, the source material for this movie are the Hasbro action figures which were fun because of the novelty of their different accessories. Not the character nuances or intriguing story lines. The movie version knows this and provides the audience with an inexhaustible series of extravagant sets, special weaponry and soldier enhancing technology. There are a number of good action scenes but my favorite was a well-edited multifaceted chase through Paris that looked authentic and very expensive.I agree with most of the criticisms of this movie: the characters are cardboard thin, the logic of Destro's plot to take over the world is weak and the flow of the movie consistently comes to a halt whenever character's back-story is provided. Yet none of these things bothered me while watching the movie. Conversely I sat back and let my senses enjoy the spectacle on the screen.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

There is just enough plot to keep the movie from turning into watching someone play a video game. Which is what a lot of action movies can get to. A lot of action movies are basically a vehicle for the director to show off just how good his special effects can be. With no thought to keeping more than the average mindless lemming glued to the screen. For what it is, it isn't bad at all. It was entertaining, which is the point of a movie, in the end.

272,jeffrey4949,Action upon action upon action. Nothing much else though.,2,15 October 2009,"This movie will probably make the producers and backers zillions. But I wish it was because the movie is good and not that there are just zillions of people out there who will watch every action movie that comes along without ever demanding that they be GOOD action movies or complaining about the bad ones. This is a movie any truly discerning action movie watcher should object to and shout at the producers about before they bore us all with an inevitable sequel 'GI Joe does it again' or whatever. They need to do better next time or don't bother.Computer graphics and effects are to be marveled at these days and those technical bods can do incredible things. In this movie there were effects, and loads of them, but somehow all that skill and terrific imagination never managed to make me forget that they were only make-believe (unlike other movies such as District 9 for example). The result was a 'computer game' feeling throughout, not helped by the almost total lack of any meaningful dialog or opportunities for anyone to act (is being constantly blown up, lazered, machine gunned, melted down or slashed into pieces by crazed samurai warriors real acting? Um... No.)Sure there was a very thin and predictable 'world-threatening' plot based on bioengineering terrorism, but its nothing special and nobody will watch this movie for the clever twists nor depth to the characters. Many were shown at times as holograms and that's how they came across to me – virtual, unreal and with nothing solid behind them. The director even missed the opportunity to make his leading ladies sexy killing machines. They looked and acted more like catty secretaries who are attracted to men in uniform and who have a fantasy to be soldiers at weekends.Yes this is an action movie. Yes it is action packed – seriously so. Yes it will be very popular. But is it an action masterpiece that will be watched again and again over the next 20 years – NO WAY. For many, possibly even a few action-junkies, I suspect that making the mistake of watching this movie once in a lifetime will be more than enough.I am pretty sure this movie will disappoint many if not most of those who watch it.",G.I.

This movie with an all star studded cast alongside with the sexiest heartthrob known to man – Channing Tatum does a tremendous job especially a cameo appearance from The Mummy star Brendan Fraser (nice touch!)

274,Rick_Swift,Whatever happened to the real American Hero?,6,14 August 2009,"Like most red-blooded American males, I grew up playing with GI Joes, so when this one was first mentioned I thought – waaaay cool, then I saw the preview and I thought, oh no! For some odd reason, the studio didn't allow early screenings or any press to see this film. Maybe they wanted our ten bucks to help dilute the close to 170 million dollar budget; they need every red cent – trust me. Merchandising is going to make up the majority of profit methinks. This was an amazing year for film, and some really great movies were out this year, but GI Joe stands alone in the comic/action genre this month – so, it should do pretty well.GI Joe is an elite squad of classified soldiers from several nations, completely secret and extremely well trained. They are on a mission to ensure the safe delivery of four nanotech warheads, which in a nutshell, nanotechnology is like a million little bugs that can reproduce and perform single tasks. Writ large, millions of little bugs eating you would turn you into powder in seconds. So, GI Joe is there to make sure the bad guys don't get these warheads. The whole film centers around the warheads, which looked like RPGs with the bio-agents from The Rock, in fact they looked exactly like that! At any rate, it was an enjoyable action movie, tons and tons of action with limited dialog and mediocre acting all around. I would have liked to say Sienna Miller did a great job as the Baroness, but she didn't even attempt the accent – what a let down. What is the point of getting all gussied up in leather with a one-shot, twenty kill, weapon if you aren't going to wield a sultry European accent, German, French, Italian (SOMETHING) to sexy it up for the drooling masses? Many of the well known figures were displayed in the film, with some origins revealed as well. Destro, The Baroness, Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow, Rip Cord, Breaker, Duke, Hawk, Scarlet, am I missing anyone? Oh yea, Brendan Fraser was supposedly Gung Ho, but I challenge anyone to recognize him as such, he looked like a weenie. No doubt he was thrown in there because director Stephen Sommers liked working with him in the Mummy films. I'm not going to inundate you with who played who – you can check out several other sources for that intel.Channing Tatum, as Duke is such a terrible actor, I know the ladies love him for his chiseled (action-figure like) presence – but the guy can kill a lot of scenes. I did notice he did far better in the out and out action sequences, and maybe he detracted from the acting of Marlon Wayans as Ripcord – or maybe Wayans sucks too. His delivery was stilted and forced in most shots. Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) keeps turning down his advances and there makes for some coy comedy – thankfully, very little comedy is forced into the script. And overall, the story wasn't terrible – but it wasn't terrific either. One plot loophole centered around the Baroness, but almost immediately it gets filled, so I liked that . . . plot holes irk me to no end.This story tells how Cobra begins, thus the title, the Rise of Cobra – and while it might not have been a critically impressive film – it did make me jump in my jet-black Tiburon and speed away the whole time thinking, ""man wouldn't my hood look bad ass with a Cobra decal"". There are some scenes that teenagers and true action lovers will enjoy with excellent, seamless special effects in most places. The cheese factor is heavy though, which I expected after seeing the previews – but if you enjoy your action movies to really just get to the good $hit and trim the fat of reality and thoughtful prose – this is your film. Now, I have to go, I am gonna check out ebay for a Cobra decal.Rick Swift - iratefilms",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
275,Othy59,"Warning, bring ear plugs!",3,21 August 2009,"Let me begin by saying that I went into this film expecting things, the first was that this is a Steven Sommers film so it would have had plenty of CGI goofiness, plucky dialogue that'll give plenty of giggles and barrels of energy. The second was that it was an adaptation of a toy line so there'll be nothing but fights and little plot except for reasons to get the characters into another fight. And thirdly I never properly watched the cartoon so I could be less distracted by the certain creative changes.Now, to the review.G.I. Joe is a new offering of CGI silliness from director Steven Sommers (The Mummy/Returns) but unlike those films, Joe definitely lacks the entertaining energy and vocal perkiness. Not only that but it is as loud as any Michael Bay film and by mixing Sommers-esquire energy (the little that was there) and Bay-esquire explosive action loud enough to shake the very foundations of the whole cinema I was left very exhausted towards the end, and not in a good way.There are elements of a good entertaining film but the noise and flashy images just cover it all up and made me care less and less through to the end. The actors themselves seem to be struggling here to make something of this film and the actors of most attention are Dennis Quaid who just seems to be doing some corny John Wayne impression. Channing Tatum was rubbish in the lead and his flat performance made him one of the weakest links in the whole film. I was surprised by Marlon Wayans (one of the many Wayans who keep infecting us with those crappy spoof films) performance who wasn't all that bad, which is a big shock! All in all this film doesn't have enough to carry it off as an entertaining Saturday afternoon film, it's loud, it's flashy and will give you a headache towards the end. Perhaps I can wait for it to come out on DVD, at least my tele has a volume control.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

As i said it has the classic Bond FORMULA, some evil mastermind with some very cool weapons tries to take over / destroy the world etc............. The story have more holes then physically possible for a movie that is 2 hours long. The Action is so bad that it feels like a parody of it self. The acting is even worse, through the hole movie you are crossing your fingers that they will all die so the evil dude will win. The visuals are on the same level as an Austin powers movie, it's so bad that I rather watch a crappy alien movie from the 50th.This movie is the worst garbage I have seen in a long time.Please for the love of god Allah, Buddha do not watch this movie.

278,MovieNewsAndUpdates,A Decent First Part,6,18 November 2012,"I have seen this movie a couple of times now and i must say it is a decent watch. However, the only reason why i watched it for the second time is to focus on more intricate aspects of the movie which i missed out on due to the action in movie. I am quite sure with the fact that the reason why the movie did not fit in much with people is because of too much of action. After having seen this movie i realized that they did try to give attention to the detail of character creation from normal beings to Joe's. But the time span dedicated to that was extremely less which i personally feel should had been more. I would have preferred knowing about just 4-5 characters in the movie but with a more emotional connect than knowing 7-10 and not having that connect at all, which i guess would have reduced the amount of action. The action scenes undoubtedly entertain you and are very huge but at times one can have a feel of too much of effects ruining the feel of the movie. Well, the entire scale of movie is very huge and rightly so. The actors seem to be chosen appropriately for their respective roles although i would have loved to see more of Dennis Quaid as General Hawk. Stephen Sommers has always made his movies extremely adventurous for the audiences but with this one i feel he went bit overboard. The Paris chase scene is one that i really enjoyed watching and for me is the best moment of the entire film.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

THE WHOLE POINT OF MOVIES IS TO MAKE PEOPLE BELIEVE.You can't sit there and say the point of the movie is to be mindless entertainment when it has a 170 million dollar budget. It's a good example of how to spend 170 million dollars on cool special effects. Just like TF2.Especially when it DOESN'T present itself as mindless entertainment. It tries (pointlessly) to deliver a message, have mystery, be funny, etc. This movie had even more ridiculous lines than TF2. The dialogue is handsdown #1 worst of the year.",G.I.

As one guy states in his review, the special effects were okay but a dime a dozen now a days. What extreme crappy dialog... I think a 10 year old would get nauseous with the dung.

282,angelicardour,http://trust-the-dice.blogspot.com/,4,25 July 2014,"I want nothing more than to say how much I loved this movie. I want to be able to say it was epic and it did the name ""G.I. Joe"" proud but I can't. Not honestly anyway.I will say that I didn't hate the movie. It had its good parts. For instance, some of the action sequences were ridiculous (in a good way). The main characters were played really well. Channing Tatum was a perfect choice for Duke and did his best to breathe life into the character. Marlon Wayans managed to bring out the action with Ripcord without losing that funny edge that suits him. As for Christopher Eccleston the ninth doctor definitely made the switch from light to dark side seamlessly – though I often found his ""accent"" a little hard to believe. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was on screen a bit too little for my taste, but I still love him none-the-less. He also shows a great deal more depth in his acting ability than I've seen up until now.As good as the acting was though, there were parts of this movie that I just couldn't get past. There's a point where there are some people who are not supposed to be able to feel fear or have any use of self- consideration. Yet those same people are pictured screaming in terror and trying to pull something out of their chest in panic rather than going after their target.If that wasn't enough to make one double glance at the screen, the storyline was flat. I knew just about everything that was going to happen within the first twenty minutes of the movie.I think, perhaps, my problems with the script and direction is a case of too many cooks spoiling the pot. I checked IMDb for the Writer credits and there were five different people listed. I've been writing a book with ONE other person and it's often difficult for us to be on the same page about where we want sh*t to go.In the end, the movie didn't suck. Perhaps I would have had more appreciation for it if I had been an avid watcher of the cartoon series, but even then – my problems still had to do with continuity more than anything else, so maybe not. I don't regret watching it, but I doubt I'll be watching it again either.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
283,Bobby9976,Leave your brain at the door and you'll enjoy this movie,6,18 August 2009,"Having watched this film today, I'm a bit perplexed at the attitude of the critics who have criticised the CGI effects and acting in this movie, both are fine, and are part of a very fun no-brainer of a movie. Personally I like to eat steak sometimes, and sometimes I just want a burger or popcorn, this doesn't have the weight of an Ingmar Bergman film, but it wasn't intended to. There is plenty of action, some surprise cameos, and an OK storyline, which is quite complicated considering the target audience/demographic. An expensive commercial for toys this may be, but then so was Transformers (and also Superman Returns if you read Kevin Smith's blogs). There was also a twist in the story that I didn't see coming (not that I tried that hard).The only contention for me was Heavy-Duty's awful mouth-full-of marbles ""London"" accent that Americans presumably think Londoners like me speak. Shame on you Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, you should have insisted on doing a real accent!I was surprised this was a 12A in the UK as some of the fight scenes involve knifing in the eye,people melting and the milder 4 letter words.Critics - get a grip - there are far more ""worthy"" films that you could be deriding.I'll happily watch this again when its out on DVD.",G.I.

There were some good effects and this movie is all about the over the top action sequences and battles between G.I. Joe and Cobra, after all this is a guy movie almost entirely just for guys, but the plot was just stupid and the acting was pretty awful, you could tell all the professional actors in this were just going through the motions to collect what I'm sure must have been huge, huge pay checks.

Okay, I know it's a comic book but it still has to be believable. The plot itself was okay. The whole thing about the nano-mites was intriguing. It was a kick-butt cool weapon, but the whole storyline of implanting the nano-mites inside humans made it dumb. They always take these plots too far till they become stupid and contrived. The acting was just average, at times laughable.The best part about it, in my opinion, was Snake Eyes fighting Storm Shadow. Those were the two best characters.

And let's not forget a part of the ending (minor spoiler below): ice drowns in water after being blown up! Apparently ice caps can only float until all that fire and smoke (underwater) makes them sink. Other than that... Special effects were enjoyable, lots of eye candy there. The dialogue and acting is about what you would expect from an average action movie, so no surprises here. I'd say, watch this movie once with a few friends while making fun of it, that's about all it's good for.

I have to say every second of this movie was action packed. Not only was it action packed, but the directer ordered it super-sized. The acting wasn't Oscar worthy, but it was good enough to pull off for the movie. Some parts of the script were a little bit cheesy, but the rest of the movie made up for it.

I was totally into GI Joe for some time. And all though, I didn't expect this film to appeal to the 30-something me, I was truly hoping for a respectful cinematic version of the characters and story.There is almost nothing thats true to the original story. For instance, the story line with Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow is completely altered. That sucks.The filmmakers didn't succeed at all in re-creating the characters for the screen. It's all just pretty people running around shooting stuff and blowing stuff up. Good enough for eleven-year-old boys, but there is absolutely nothing behind this shoot-em-up story to appeal to grown ups.The story is crap. We've seen it a thousand times before. The action is a sleeping pill at best. The acting is so so.

290,ced650,Simply entertain,6,11 March 2010,"For if we look more closely at the ""details"" kind of love story between Duke (Channing Tatum, who it is obvious here, is not a great actor) and Baron (Sienna Miller) it must be said that history deserves to be better exploited since the state would have been better was deleted. Finally, the goal is to entertain, that the film largely succeeds even if some are missed sfx it poses no problem as the final action scenes succeed and Marlon Wayans fulfills his contract to do his show in the role of Ripcord (which over the film gradually wins the heart of Scarlett (Rachel Nichols) between them and the sauce is also much better than the history between Duke and Baron, because between them is not entertain but to add some dramatic tension to the film, which does however not for a moment as I already said the next fun and entertaining wins hands down on everything else).If not, move on, the two characters ninja, Storm Shadow (Byung-hun Lee) and Snake Eyes (Ray Park) provide much of the show and ultimately steal the rest of the cast.

Underground and Underwater hideouts and bases, hidden guns in vehicles, all had his trade mark, but they were all hashed into one movie, plus throw in a bit of Dr. Who surrealism (hang on Christopher Eccleston is in it!) how will they follow that up as they have left us wondering at the end of the movie.Yes plenty of action, but over the top and nothing really new and original.If you have not already seen this movie and want to see it yourself, borrow it or wait until it gets to the budget price range.",G.I.

293,Big_Heavy_Thing,Clean Action Movie for Kids,7,14 December 2009,"Good film for it's genre: a action-movie primarily for the kids.Hard-core GI Joe fans (which is a questionable identification in its own right, up there with Furies and Real Doll enthusiasts) should not bother to watch the film because it is not being marketed to them; it's being marketed to kids.As a movie for kids, it does a great job in many ways:A) Low graphic violence level - Sure a couple of people get skewered with samurai swords, but there's no blood and guts getting sprayed in your face as in Pulp Fiction. When something gets blown up, severed heads don't go flying into the audience.B) Low explicit sexuality level - Unlike Transformers 2: Revenge of Michael Bey's Adolescent Libido, there are no gratuitous rump or breast shots; there are no shots of women running around like the Wild Man of Borneo in heat. There is no humping or sexual innuendos. There was also very little profanity.C) The plot was easily followable by a young audience (which was, of course, the target demographic) - Certain critics, I've noticed, moaned that script was not stellar and the plot was cheesy. These people should perhaps refrain from the insertion of quick-dry cement into their behinds; it appears to be affecting the circulation of blood to their brain. GI Joe has never been a 'hard-science' venture from the beginning. Anybody who ever saw the 80's cartoon can testify to that. I remember one episode where a GI Joe member put a fish-bowl on his head, then held his breath and jumped out a airlock into space - so he could get to a Cobra space station. In another episode, a Cobra member took down a F-16 by throwing a fishing net in front of it. Is *this* the ""missing realism"" that GI Joe fans are looking for? D) Some back-story was added to many of the characters. - Kids (and adults too)want to know this stuff. How *did* Snake Eyes become who he is? How did Cobra Commander become Cobra Commander? Exactly why is The Baroness called ""The Baroness""? Finally, we have some back-story explaining these people. I expect we'll hear about Scarlet and others in up-coming movies. I thought this was infinitely preferable to just handing us a bunch of quirky characters like some 70's ninja movie would do.E) The action / non-action sequences were well-paced. Any fool can throw together stupendous action sequences that go on and on and overwhelm you. This film carefully measures the distance between action and non-action so that younger viewers (need I mention that this is the target demographic?) do not get too much or too little. The film keeps a perfect pace between exposition and action.F) The comedy in the story is light and not malicious. -- These days, it seems like humor in movies is cynical, harsh, or sarcastic. Or sexual. Instead, the use of comedy is of a good nature (Boy tries to get Girl; Girl teasingly says no; *not* Boy tries to get Girl; Girl tells him he has a Oedipus Complex then suggests rehab).G) There are no homophobic, sexist, or racist overtones, portrayals, or dialog. Kids aren't going to walk away from it feeling alienated.If you're looking for a movie for, say, the kids demographic, that is relatively clean, fun, and easy on the eyes, GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra is the real McCoy.",G.I.

294,viofitz,Hmm... Quite surprising but not really special....,6,30 October 2009,"Title is surprising ever-since I've never heard about G.I. Joe saga anymore around 10 years ago in my country, so I really expecting for this movie since I like G.I. Joe in my childhood. Too bad I really forgot how did I like them so I know zero about G.I. Joe, also Stephen Sommers were involved to direct this flick after we know some of his movies.(The Jungle Book, The Mummy/Returns, Van Helsing) The movies itself is not bad it contains full of action packed that really enjoyable to be watch, but like reviews said I agree that some CGI looks nothing real & the story seems plain simple + I believed why fans didn't like it is some story & character's seems not entirely correct to the real saga. I personally thinks the character's looks fine specially The Baroness she looks wonderful & I was really expecting for the next sequel that will involves her being with G.I. Joe. The real retarded story for me is only back story of Snake Eyes & Storm Shadow, why in the world those cheeky balded master really expecting Snake Eyes to be win from his brother instead of cheering Storm Shadow too? He only gave a plain cold atmosphere on Storm Shadow, so I think it's really invited Storm Shadow to earns his jealousy. But it doesn't make any sense why only jealousy makes him kill his own master? However, I don't really by on the flaw since G.I. Joe is not from a Japanese creators so I don't care how Hollywood ruined them with an exception white scumbag being ended with Asian gal. Sequels? Yeah, I'm waiting... Hope it turns more better than this....",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
295,kkhannah,"Decent fun, so long as you don't think too hard.",6,24 July 2012,"I'm going to admit right up front that I've never seen any of the G.I Joe cartoons when I was a child. I hardly know any of the history about the characters, just what I've gleaned from growing up on a steady diet of pop culture references. However, I didn't feel as if this lack of knowledge worked against me when I watched G.I Joe; indeed, I'm almost positive that I liked the movie better than I would have had I known about the characters ahead of time. To be honest, G.I Joe isn't anything that remarkable or unique; it's in the same vein as many futuristic action thrillers and, since I had no connection to the characters ahead of time, that was how I regarded it. However, even if it doesn't bring anything new to the genre, it's certainly quite a bit of fun to watch. The cast all put in decent (or, at least passable) performances. My personal favorite was Christopher Eccleston as Destro, who I thought played the role with just a hint of camp. Indeed, many of the actors seemed to touch on the campiness with their performances, as if they themselves knew that some of the lines coming out of their mouths were rather silly. The only aspect of the film that actually bothered me was the seemingly random inclusion of flashbacks touching on Snake Eyes' past. While I understand that this was done to give the character a back story, they interrupt the flow of the film and despite some very impressive martial arts demonstrations, they don't improve the movie.Nonetheless, if you don't pay too much attention or think too hard, G.I Joe is certainly a good distraction before bed. The action sequences are quite fun, the story (mostly) makes sense and it's always fun to see actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a role I never would have envisioned him in. Overall, I recommend the film if you're even a casual fan of the genre but if it takes a bit more than explosions and sword fighting to grab your attention, I recommend a pass.",G.I.

While I think Dennis Quaid's performance was a little stiff, there was only so much any actor could do with such terrible dialog. I honestly believe the acting was just about as good as it could get with that painfully banal script. Every character in the movie was a trite cliché, the story was ridiculous and the dialog was top notch work for any talented 6th grader. In fact, I wonder if the writers let their teenage children write the script.I'm not kidding. It's THAT bad.And yet, I still had fun watching this awful movie. Most of the CG effects were awesome and a great deal of this movie was a feast for the eyes. It ""looked cool"". That's all I really expected from it...and so I can't say I was disappointed.

If you've ever watched some of the old animated movies then Rise of the Cobra will just seem like a live action version. Like the old source material this movie had glorified shootouts, unrealistic technology, over-the-top bad guys, locations all over the world, secret bases, and a plot to take over the world. Other than that I'm not going to bother commenting on the plot given the abundance of holes and convinces. Some of the graphics looked very fake. The ""love subplots"" were laughable at best.

Tatum is way too young to portray an iconic character like Duke and cobra commander didn't have that comedic charisma that made the animated series so humorous. Also, the acting was cheesy and some of the actors way overacted especially Dennis Quaid as General Hawk, which I was kind of shocked to see because Dennis Quaid is a great actor and Tatum as Duke was nothing like the animated character. He doesn't have the charisma like the animated Duke, and Tatum sounded like he was just talking. Special effects were the only area that was alright, they were actually fun to watch, but that's all this film seemed cracked up to be, just pure mindless entertainment sort of like the Transformers live action flicks.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
304,boonhanlau,Kinda enjoyable,7,26 May 2013,"After reading some of the reviews and seeing the low ratings it's got. I was discouraged to watch this movie. I'm glad I've changed my mind.Good actions and good effects. If you like fighting movies, you shouldn't miss this one. Some of the people have expected too much from a fighting movie like this. They expected very good acting or so on. When you're watching an action movie like this, what you should care about is the fighting and effects.Pure fighting, watch it if you like fighting. Don't if you expected more than that.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
305,mr_Goodbomb,GI Joe: Because We've Run Low on Franchises,4,7 August 2009,"Let's face it... I didn't go into the theater expecting a thrilling experience in film. I went in expecting a modern example of a blockbuster: a fairly mindless, heartless script pressed out using the same formulas that have made other blockbusters, as mindless as this one, successful, with a few key actors worth watching and, in this film's case, some memories (or toys) from my childhood stamped into the molds and forced to conform to the shape of the figurative cookie they've already agreed to finance. I understood that going in. I could expect ""Michael Bay"" with someone else's name on it.I wasn't surprised. The story was as expected... A muscular white lead, an African American partner, joining a secret group of awesome dudes and being pitted against a group of mean, ugly men in sweet costumes. Epic, entirely CGIed battle ensued. When the female antagonist is immediately introduced as someone from the lead's past, I could already foresee the character flexing and struggling to squeeze tears from his muscular ducts. We get it. As soon as a pretty girl on the good guy's side is introduced, I expected pseudo-ghetto, tough-but-funny side remarks from the black sidekick made to impress her. I get it. Dennis Quaid. I get it. It's all the structure, stereotypes, and expected plot turns that will make the dumber percentile of a movie-going audience laugh when they're supposed to and sharply inhale in surprise when they're supposed to. If I wanted to even have a chance at enjoying the movie, I had to look past of this, ignore to poorly-constructed plots, the awful script, the terrible one-liners, and the overuse of CGI that almost makes it an animated movie.There were a few things that were worse than I had imagined, and tough to overlook. Before the movie even started, I was reminded of the Hasbro logo. This movie was financed by the company that made, and will now make the new line of, the toys for the franchise. GI Joe was a patriotic, Nationalist series of toys originally manufactured in the 1960s and re-invented during the 80s along with an animated series... less for creative purposes, or for the purpose of having a television series at all, and more obviously a vessel in which to sell toys. The fairly blatant attempt to market service in the US Forces to children was missed by few, and each and every action figure reeked of ""heck yes, the Army"" the same way that Barbie smelled of ""I can be anything I want as long as dinner is ready when my husband gets home and I look good doing it."" The movie smelled of this, too. The babes were hot, the guys were tough, the gear was awesome, and everything looked like one giant toy advert. Can anyone say Phantom Menace? Being marketed for kids in many ways, many of the plot twists and changes were quite obviously done to suit this theme. The costumes and costume changes were featured and laid out as linear as possible. The weapons, while causing a lot of property damage, didn't often hurt or maim people (unless they were bad guys, which means me to my next point). The good guys were attractive (arguably, I mean, uh, Dennis Quaid), and the bad guys were either entirely covered by armor and nearly robotic or physically marred and dismembered, unattractive and unappealing physically. The two ""bad guys"" who had the ability to change, become good or more evil, did just that: one turned to the good side and remained attractive, while the other stuck with the bad guys and was beaten, burnt, and had his human appearance stripped away for the appearance of a metal man.Then, there's the CGI. It seems like someone fell asleep while cleaning up and improving the appearance of these scenes, woke up, realized time was short, and clicked ""Render."" Even the people that I went to see the movie with that know nothing of how these sorts of movies, and the CGI shots within them, are made, said ""this looks like crap,"" and it did. It wasn't believable, and on a big screen, it looked worse than most of the junk you'll find in early morning cartoons or Sci Fi Channel originals. It did, however, say a lot for the movie as a whole.Then, last but not least in this disappointment scale, was the acting. Most of the actors weren't stellar by any account, but serviceable with the script they were given (seriously, I have to wonder how many times actors stopped while reading the next scene from the script and said, ""...really?""). But the lead, Mr. Channing Tatum, should have stuck with underwear modeling. From his first line (a bored, underacted ""attention!"") to the last time we see him make a myriad of facial expressions hoping one of them is the right one, this guy was unreasonably bad. The dog from the Taco Bell commercials was a far better actor, may he rest in peace.The one saving grace, and what I had to pay attention to in order to keep my faith in movies and my sanity, were a few choice performances. Much like being the saving grace of The Phantom Menace, Ray Park was fantastic. It could be because he was mysterious... it could also be because he wasn't given any atrocious one-liners. Christopher Eccleston was more than serviceable, as well, but I expected no less. The real kicker was Gordon-Levitt, however, and I think he had the most eyes (unless you were mentally inept, prepubescent, and watching Channing Tatum) on him. Whoever was sitting in a board room and offered, ""you know that guy from all the Fox Searchlight movies? Let's get him,"" I both applaud you for your tenacity and question your ability to do rudimentary math. However, he was entertaining, no matter how you count it, which is what this movie was all about.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
306,eastcoastdvds,Blu Ray doesn't make the CGI look any better,3,22 July 2021,"Watching the new blu ray made be realize even more how heavy, heavy , heavy on the CGI this movie is. Some more realistic than others, but easily noticeable in the car chases (like watching GTA). Like others have said, if you're a 13 year old boy, this is the movie for you. Light on story line and heavy on action. There is an attempt to build depth into some of the characters, but the motivations for turning to the evil side just simply fall laughably flat. Heavy on the good ol' conservative morality (and absolution), with some dated pokes at France (remember ""freedom fries""?). I didn't expect much in the way of story and it didn't deliver.",G.I.

307,refaelba,The Best Film in History.,10,2 November 2009,"I have to say, I didn't have high hopes when me and my friends entered the Cinema to watch this movie.But I was wrong.From the very first minute I was blown away with the intricate dialogue and sophisticated characters. If you want to make a film, be sure to watch this one first, to see how it's done: top notch character development, meaningful writing and a brilliant story to keep it all together. Some characters developed to a level that had the entire audience moved in sympathy. This movie shows that on both sides of the war, there are actually people, and even an Evil Boss is really just a person, with loves and hates and a dream. This movie, hands down, changed lives in the cinema. This is the kind of movie that Tarantino will like to refer to in one of his films.The action scenes in this movie were incredible as well, with a lot of detail going to the CGI, to the level of perfection. Movies that offer such advanced visuals are very hard to come by, especially when it's done so delicately and when it blends so naturally with the rest of the film.Another strong point of this feature is the interesting pacing, which gives you the right amount of time to adore and completely come to terms with every scene, while holding you interested and never bored or confused. I think that my favorite bit of this movie is how everything seems logical and real, and makes sense, and that's a stunning accomplishment, given the movie is based on action figures.Bottom line: There are so many movies today that are empty, bad, and a complete waste of time. How lucky we are to have movies like G.I. Joe to remind us how much we love good cinema. If you didn't watch this eternal achievement, please find the time to do so, and you'll appreciate a good movie like never before.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
308,ice-102,Mind Numbing,1,19 April 2010,"Seriously, what the G, i, joe...How, just how did anybody approve this, or it was beyond fixing, they just released it for a quick buck?It is so unbelievably corny, its just painful, not 1 line of dialog isn't made of fermented dairy.I saw the trailer on top gear, and though, wow that looks great. failed to see it in the cinema so caught it now, and glad I forgot to see it. Where to begin... First thing that came to mind, the SFX, I know that is not the be all and end all, but it's worse than star wars, and thats saying something. The first action scene was so incoherent, I nearly turned it off, wish I had done. So the plot: Some green goo from any cliché sci fi movie gets stolen, oh no... so great, you can see its got stolen, now lets spend 10 minutes explaining to the viewer that its stolen... Thinking back, I don't think anything beyond the obvious is explained, the audience is treated so lowly, it just injects searing boredom into you. so yes, green goo stolen, sterile love interest is introduced, 10 minutes spent looking at holograms bla bla bla boring.The characters are as deep as the underside of a mug, none of them connectible, or even worth bearing a thought whilst they are off screen.So plot is boring, characters are boring, sodden in clichés, sfx is painful to watch, surly the cool gadgets are good? 'its the future', these ideas are worse than the ones in the electrical isle in pound-land, my god they are stupid. But not as stupid as they look when they break all laws of physics, sensibility and suspension of disbelief.

309,trooperjac,G.I. Joinery,4,22 October 2009,Typical derivative big action small plot stuff. Quite well produced I suppose and if you can turn off your cynical brain reasonably enjoyable. Features all the standard stereotypes you would expect in a movie of this calibre.Gung-ho Heroe Marine - check Disfigured Mad Scientist bent on world domination - check Stuck-up but kick-ass hot girl - check Comic relief black sidekick - check Gruff & Highly Respected Commander - check Uber Martial Arts Bad Guy Nemesis - checkPretty standard fare with decent actors however. Jonathan Pryce and Dennis Quaid must have had a free summer last year. Sienna Miller was average but not to harsh on the eyes. Rachel Nichols is pretty awesome on the eyes as was her leather catsuit. Channing Tatum - this guy gets roles based purely on his pectoral muscles rather than his acting muscles. He delivers a performance so wooden at times I thought he had been replaced by a shop dummy.The production is decent but as with a lot of modern movies falls back on C.G.I. which for many things just looks really bad. Thr gratuitous Polar bear couldn't have looked worse if they had got the producer's kid to just draw the thing straight onto the celluloid.If you're at a loose end and there is nothing else available it's an average popcorn movie.,G.I.

310,williamsij,Like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon,6,10 December 2009,"Judging by some other comments I probably enjoyed this more as someone who didn't know much about the G I Joe universe before watching this.It reminds me a lot of the children's action cartoons I enjoyed so much as a child growing up in the 80s. The action is non-stop with lots of fighting, shooting, car chases, explosions etc - and there are some pretty decent special effects too. Yes – it is shallow – but those Saturday morning cartoon shows weren't exactly Shakespeare either. It's also got a very silly plot – but again, so did the cartoon shows. As long as you treat it as such I thought that it more than hit the spot in terms of providing loud, flashing, thrilling and credulity-bending entertainment.One final comment is that I actually found the violence to be a bit more than I probably expected. Quite a few people clearly die (none of that A Team-esquire shaking of the head here) and there are some quite shocking bits involving decapitations, impalements and melting faces. Any parents wanting to show this to younger children should bear this in mind.To summarize, if the aim was to capture that Saturday morning cartoon show feel but do so with some state-of-the-art CGI effects then Stephen Sommers has done a cracking job. Come on Stephen – make some more films. We forgive you for Van Helsing.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
311,desveaux,Mindless is an understatement:,4,8 August 2009,"A mix of Armageddon, X2 and Star Wars; Hollywood mindless movie to the max! How does it ""honor"" Armageddon? Mainly in it's level of stupidity.Towards the beginning, we see our heroes shoot at the bad guys with bazookas and bullets, to no effect at all. Why don't they at least fall down? Are they aliens? Nope; just don't think, the movie says, over and over again. Later, a good girl fights the bad girl; we see her take her invisible clothes, but she doesn't put it on at once; waits until she's nearly killed, first. And since she's nearly getting killed by chains, why does invisibility help at that point? Of course, the bad girl Still wins the fight! Why do we need a collider lab help ""activate,"" the weapon? On and on, it says, ""Do Not think today!"" But even an eight yr. old thinks! Why do female soldiers wear low cut shirts?It's like X2, because it uses the idea of controlling others with a chemical, that looks just the same in X2. It looks like Star Wars, in the fighting subs. Ya, but why not just blow up the under water city with missiles??Oh, ya, I forgot: do Not think! Why is the black hero Always making jokes? Oh ya: like Star Wars and C-3PO!Almost forgot the biggest ""Don't think"" moment at all! Around 1/2 way into it, the good guys are underground in Egypt; well the bad guys are coming and at first, the heroes seem to realize it, but no, they do not!

That's absolute crap. Is that the excuse people are going to give bad film these days? The fact is this film is terrible. The acting is atrocious from everyone; the CGI is on a par with the Star Wars Special Edition Jabba the Hutt (the '97 version); The best characters are under used (i.e Snake Eyes - not too mention his moulded lips that make him look like he's pouting all the time) and instead the 'star' of the show, Channing 'Dead-Behind-the-Eyes' Tatum gets all the frigging screen time. I'm sorry but this moron should be investigated by trading standards for calling himself an 'actor'. I suppose he's quite chavy though, so I expect he appeals to a lot of people here in the UK. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because Levitt is great as Cobra Commander (ignoring all the Baroness / Duke sh*t) and Scarlett is a real beaut.

This is a great way to spend two hours and forget about all of this crap.Also, remember people, when you text during the movies your phone screens are also very annoying and distracting.Whoever you are, if you can't unhook from the Matrix for two hours of your life after spending a fortune at a theater, you have issues.

Being a student of film, I really do understand the necessity of translating a cartoon to motion picture i not easy. A motion picture needs to have a bit more realism, yes, especially when you're dealing with the military. What was done here is atrocious, and a travesty of such a terrible caliber that it has completely turned me against Stephen Sommers. And yes I loved Van Helsing. Man where do I start, maybe the terrible miscasting of Duke and Cobra Comander especially. Captain Hauser? Last I heard Duke was a sergeant, and always has been. How about the stupid convoluted and pointless script, or the terrible cringe worthy special effects, and performances from everyone. I am a Chris Eccelston fan, I love Doctor Who. All I can say is what happened? Like I said I love cheesy over the top movies so very much, Street Fighter is my favorite movie of all time and it came closer to an accurate G.I Joe motion picture then this train wreck. It really would have been so easy to write this film if they had gotten someone who new the actual story. I don't buy for one minute Larry Hama had anything to do with this film. So what I am saying if you are any kind of G.I. Joe fan, stay as far away from this movie as you possibly can. Don't even acknowledge its existence.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
316,snovack,Enjoyable Action Flick,8,6 December 2009,"This is a movie that is based on a cartoon. Go into it with that in mind and you'll know what to expect. Be that as it may, as a fan of the James Bond franchise, I really enjoyed G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra, as the Joes are essentially a team of combat-oriented Bond-type characters all working together, with COBRA as the S.P.E.C.T.R.E that makes G.I. Joe necessary. Thoroughly enjoyable popcorn flick. The cast works well in the roles they are chosen for, particularly Dennis Quaid as General Hawk and Rachel Nichols as Scarlet on the side of the Joes. Cobra's standouts are Christopher Eccelston as Destro and Sienna Miller as the Baroness. The masterstroke however, in my opinion, was casting Ray Park (a.k.a. ""Darth Maul"" of the Star Wars saga) as the martial arts master Snake Eyes. I disagree with the reviewers here that state the script was poorly written. This is written as the beginning to a saga, and does an admirable job of introducing the characters and the world to us. I look forward to the planned sequels.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

318,TheFriendlySniper,The better toy-based movie released this year,7,12 August 2009,"This is the second movie based on a Hasbro toy to come out this year. I'm sure you know the first is the sequel to 2007's Transformers. I want to start this review by saying that I think TF2 is a terrible film. I didn't go in expecting a masterpiece, hell it's a movie based on a freakin' TOY right? I just wanted some decent action, held together by a good enough plot (which is apparently an unspeakable word these days). However TF2 disappointed even with my low expectations. Bad plot and pacing plus the action sucked (all those good special effects but they didn't know how to use it right). The reason why I gave my thoughts on TF2 is so you, the reader of this review, can determine whether or not we're on the same page. I should also add that I was never a big fan of G.I. Joe. Saw the cartoon when I was young but don't remember a lot from it. Keeping in mind that the first Hasbro flick sucked (for me), I had low hopes for Joe as well. District 9 was supposed to be released in my country today and I went to see that, however it got delayed. So I ended up watching G.I. Joe.And you know what? It wasn't so bad. Like TF2, this movie had action throughout. However in Joe the action is done in such a way that we can tell what's happening and see who's effing up who. In this way, we have FUN. The plot isn't great but it was just good enough. It's not terrible and won't make you cringe. Sure there are some cheesy moments here and there but it doesn't ruin the movie.This is a movie based on a toy done fairly alright. Carry the kids if you think they can handle the violence, which highly warrants the PG-13 rating. There's nothing else to see right now 'til District 9 is released (assuming you've seen all the other 'blockbusters') so if you're bored go see Joe. It's entertaining.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

The car chase scene was cool. The accelerator suites were a very nice touch. They should have made it like Transformers 2 and had a lot of comedy. Shawn Wayans did a pretty nice job to be his first action movie. All the acting was pretty good. It wasn't as good as i thought it would be. Don't be too excited to see it.

324,kmier-2,This is way beyond the action figures you used to play with as a kid.,8,10 August 2009,"Whether you used to play with the action figures as a child, collected them (and still have them in mint condition) or simply haven't done either, you (as the audience, of course) will not be disappointed. Although Paramount, the studio behind ""G.I. Joe"", did not screen this for critics in advance for fear of harsh reviews (this coming after the not-so-good effect on ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen""), this actually isn't bad. Although I didn't get the first part until later on, the cast and director (""The Mummy"" and ""Van Helsing"" director Stephen Sommers, respectively) aren't perfect, but they did the very best they could (hence the vote rating). The story concerns the Joes (from what I remember, played by Channing Tatum of ""Step Up"", Marlon Wayans, and Rachel Nichols), part of an underground elite team sent to basically do the impossible (examples are in the movie, I won't give most of them out). Led by General Hawk (played by Dennis Quaid), they are sent to stop Mccullen and the Baroness ( Mccullen is played by ""Doctor Who""'s Christopher Eggleston, while the Baroness is played by Sienna Miller) from starting nuclear war in Moscow and Washington, D.C. If they fail, (according to General Hawk in the commercials advertising this movie), ""there is no backup"". There are many parts that you don't see coming, and the action is loaded to the extreme (also, if you want some comic relief, you got it from Marlon Wayans- ""there's a manual?""). So as I said before, whether you used to play with the figures in your youth, or are just seeking some cool action to keep your eyes glued to the screen, this is as close as it gets, my friend. I enjoyed it, and I'm sure you will.P.S. A few notes:This film is titled ""G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra"", but the Cobra Commander (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) does not appear until the near end of the movie.The only character with no dialog whatsoever in the movie is Snake Eyes (played by Ray Park, whom you may have seen from ""X-Men"" and ""Star Wars- Episode 1: The Phantom Menace""). Snake Eyes is seen somewhat after the beginning of the movie.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
325,pk_pulak_kmr,Neat action-comedy,8,27 November 2010,"GI Joe The Rise of Cobra is essentially your typical SFX-ridden action-comedy blockbuster. It serves as prequel of sorts to the comic-book series.The story essentially centers around an arms dealer James McCullen, head of some MARS corporation, who's come up with a new weapons technology known as nanomites, which are basically nanobots that eat stuff up. Hence, they have the potential to consume everything from enemy tanks to entire cities.The twist in the tale comes when a military convoy transporting the nanomites, comprising of the protagonists Duke (Channing Tatum) and Rip (played by Marlon Wayans) are ambushed and decimated by an unusually powerful band of troublemakers lead by Ana, or the Baroness (played by Sienna Miller) who seems to be an old acquaintance of Duke. However, the attempted heist is promptly routed when a group of soldiers comprising of Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park), and Breaker (Said Taghmaoui) rout the invaders and rescue the survivors. Duke and Ripcord are told by General Hawk(Dennis Hopper) that these soldiers are part of an elite military program known as GI Joe, and Duke and Ripcord insist upon joining it.Meanwhile, we also discover that James McCullen had actually attempted to rob his own weaponry, as he's actually running an elaborate scam which involves misusing the nanomite warheads in order to gain supreme power over the world, or something like that.The film works simply because it's highly entertaining, despite having a slightly clichéd good vs evil plot. You have brilliantly choreographed action sequences, an engaging screenplay, and the film is paced well enough so that there's hardly a dull moment. The actors pull off their roles well-enough, and the characters are good enough to be placed above the ""cardboard cut-outs"" critics keep complaining about.Of course, there's little or no logic in the film. To truly enjoy the film you need to suspend your disbelief, and leave your brains at home. Also, on the downside, some of the sub-plots, such as the back story of Duke and the Baroness, could have been scripted a little better, as the flashbacks in the climax, where the Baroness has a change of heart, were pretty tacky. Also, the ending, which clearly hints at a sequel coming around, was a bit abrupt.However, these are hardly things to be worried about when you're munching on a bag of popcorn watching uber-cool stunts, and stuff flying around. This is a very fun flick to watch, just don't expect anything deep or profound to come out of it.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
326,finnfriends,A GREAT FILM (Just don't take it too seriously).,10,18 January 2011,"Well, what can I say? I turned this movie on mostly to laugh at it, but I found myself laughing with it. It falls into the ""delightful cheese"" category I enjoy a lot. If this movie took itself seriously it would be just another crappy action movie. Hell, I hate most movies of this kind (especially Transformers). This however, entertains from start to finish. It doesn't waste much time on filler or waste time before getting started. By the way, unlike some modern PG13 movies, this one is definitely suitable for pretty much all ages.The plot is basically an excuse one. Tough soldier Duke and his wannabe pilot friend end up joining a secret organization called GI Joe to fight international terrorism. The evil MARS Corporation wants to wreak havoc so that people will turn to the most powerful man in the world, who they wish to control. Duke's ex-fiancé, a ninja, and the future Cobra Commander attempt to attack various major cities, and the Joes have to save the day.A couple interesting notes: 1. Again, this is not a serious movie. Among other things, the line ""knowing is half the battle"" actually turns up. Some things are really intentionally ridiculous, like a quadruple crossbow with homing explosive arrows and four laser sights. In fact, the best two words to describe the style of the movie is ""crazy awesome."" A perfect mix of awesome things until they become hilarious. If you are 9 you'll be enthralled, but otherwise please treat this as a comedy. The film is also heavy on homages to other movies, watch out for the black mask being lowered on Cobra Commander's head. 2. This movie bears a striking resemblance to the satirical ""Team America: World Police."" If you watch that movie as well, you'l have even more fun.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Great action and special effects/CGI. I loved this movie even with the strange storyline and brutal acting. Marlon Wayans has no business getting paid to be in a movie - he is that bad.I saw this with two of my buddies and we had a good laugh after the movie. We all knew it was crap, but loved it anyways. We agreed that the best actor in this movie was Snake Eyes. No doubt the critics will pan this movie. Yes, the acting is awful and the plot is full of ridiculous holes. But if they get off their high horse and are honest about it, they will admit it was fun.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
328,d3jean,Very Entertaining Summer Movie,7,16 August 2009,"Over the last year G.I. Joe has been one of the most scrutinized film productions in Hollywood history. Things didn't get any better when the trailers were released earlier this year and most people were up in arms about how crappy the CGI looked and how over the top the movie seemed. I however couldm't wait to see this film as i am a big Stephen Sommers fan and have been since i saw Deep Rising in the movie theater back in 1998. So as always i went to see this film opening weekend hoping the negative reviews were wrong and this simply was a good no brianer summmer popcorn movie. Well i'm happy to report i was right. This film was entertaining from start to finish i won't talk about the plot since who goes to G.I. Joe for plot but i will talk about the action. Let me put it this way action scenes in this movie put Michael Bay's Transformers films to shame. The Paris/Accelerator suit chase sequence is one of the best of the decade and is so beautifully shot i had my jaw opened for the duration the sequence was on the screen. Sommers gets huge accolades from me just for keeeping the camera still for most of the film and rarely uses the horrible shaly cam which detaches a viewer from an action scene in my opinion. Sommmers should also get credit for getting good actors to be in this film actors who normally woudn't be in a film like this. The standouts in the cast are Marlon Wayanans, Joseph Gordon Leveitt, and Sienna Miller who plays the Baroness. Wayans was the most surprising as his stupid humor was toned down in this movie but still provided humor when it was needed and most appropriate. Zeveitt was amazing as Cobra Commander and that voice he used for the film should get an Oscar all on it's own. Lastly, Miller looked great in leather spandex and was quite intimidating as the Baroness especially in the early scenes of the movie. Before i end this review i want to point out a couple of negatives. First any parents thinking about bringing a little one to see this film should know that the opening scene of the movie is very gruesome and disturbing (Spoiler it takes place in 17th century France and shows a bad man getting a molten hot mask planted on his face mere seconds after it was pulled from the fire. Let's just say not quite the opening you'd expect from a family friendly movie. Also i do feel the movie goes on a little too long and some dialogue scenes could have been excised to put in a little more action. Lastly, there were too many flashbacks in this film showing how each character relates to the other that should have been put in the sequel and let this have been a simple James Bond inspired adventure story. However, overall the movie succeeded at what it set out to do and entertained me throughout. Definitely check it out.P.S. The gadgets were great and rivaled anything in the bond pictures. The Accelerator suits Invisible clothes Laser crossbow Missle firing cars Computers that record people's memories while they're deadSpoiler: Watch for Brendan Fraser's cameo appearance during a Joe training session. Kevin j. O' Connor as the scientist who created the nanobites.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Stephen Sommers showed some great stuff during ""The Mummy"". I really enjoyed that movie. It was something different. However, after ""The Mummy Returns"" I think he had nothing more to show us. So, with ""G.I.Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" he managed to ruin a franchise that could have a great potential. He showed us comic book stunts meant for kids only. He destroyed the characters, he altered the whole ""G.I.Joe"" atmosphere. I have to admit, as soon as his name was announced as director, I saw that coming. He didn't take an example of ""Transformers"". He just directed a very very bad idea and let the fans down. Shame...",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
331,Duraznitot,Entertaining,5,10 June 2020,To be honest it's just a standard action movie. The plot isn't very original and it's kinda predictable but it's still entertaining and worth watching in a boring afternoon or night. Considering that it's a movie basically made to sell toys it could have been worse.,G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
332,sipovic,Don't ask why or it all will fall apart,3,8 August 2009,"This movie positioned itself as mindless fun. And as much I agree with ""mindless"" I found really hard to see this movie as ""fun"". And there are a lot of reason to it. Steven Sommers forgot the 1st rule of good action - the movie needs a HERO. Yes, formally there is one, but he is no different than dozens other characters with silly names (which I honestly try but couldn't remember). Characters are probably the weakest element of this movie (primitive script doesn't count no more, since now it is a genre standart) . This movie has so many popular names in it but there isn't a good (or decent at least) character. I sometimes even confuse good guys and bad guys. I was a little amused by J. Gordon-Levitt's appearance in Darth Vader's style mask and small (and absolutely unnecessary) cameos of Arnold Vosloo and Jonathan Pryce but that's all. And what even worse, instead giving personality to characters, Sommers made pathetic soap opera flashbacks about them which not only make them looks even more unpleasant but also waste valuable screen time. The most important thing that you must not do during watching this is asking ""why?"" because if you do, nothing make sense. How dumb man could join elite military squad? Why Gordon-Levitt's character turns evil? Why somebody would build a secret military base in the middle of Egypt? Why somebody would build a secret military base underwater in Alaska where is could be easily buried with one shot in ice? And the most important - why in the vocabulary of ancient Celt was a word for emergency catapulting? There are much more but this I remember after only a few seconds. Yes, this movie has nice action sequence (especially chase in french) but not of the action is that good, for example final fight is a one big mess, nothing of what happened made any sense so the only thing you can do just look on explosions and bright colors and wait till it's over. In total this movie probably a little better than ""godawful Transformers 2"" but just slightly but still I hardly could imagine any reasonable human being who will want to watch it second time",G.I.

333,gigitravels,Great entertaining movie - delivers as promised!!,9,9 August 2012,"Non stop action and special effects, very enjoyable movie.The plot, while very enjoyable, is definitely somewhat 'dumbed down' at many points, but that actually made it positively hilarious to me.Great watch, recommended.What I didn't like: some backgrounds in the movie are computer generated in a very obvious way. Hope they'll get more budget for part 2. Still there are a lot of great effects besides this.What this movie doesn't have: If you are looking for pseudo-deep psychology with 'new-age' heroes that are also somewhat anti heroes, a movie phenomenon which is (unfortunately) trendy these days, you'll have to look elsewhere.This is good old fashioned good guys vs. bad guys movie with the kind of heroes I used to look up to as a child.",G.I.

334,janeathane,G.I. Average Joe,4,9 August 2009,"""When all else fails, they don't."" However like most of the other movies this summer, G.I. Joe Rise of Cobra also failed. The CGI had its moments, comedic at points and astounding at others, though for a movie that ran off of it I was expecting it to be more impressive. The acting was obviously not Oscar-worthy but it is definitely razzie-worthy. Perhaps it was the weak script, or perhaps Hollywood just needs to realize how horrible of an actor Channing Tatum is. I'm sure that this movie was not done very well as it seems to be targeted towards a younger crowd (which contradicts itself by donning a PG-13 rating) but even though it has its weak points it is still entertaining. Sadly it set itself up for a sequel, but I don't think that it will go any further than a script, if that.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
335,curren-waters,"If you're a fan of G.I. Joe, you'll love it!",7,13 November 2009,"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is a cliché, flashy cheese-ball of a movie. So, if you're a fan of the cartoon, you'll love it! The script is filled with tons of corny one-liners, and if you shut your mind off, most of them are actually pretty funny. Just listening to the dialogue reminded me of a few lines from the cartoon, which is exactly what I wanted; a movie that stayed true to the source material.The action scenes were pretty darn fun to watch. They were flashy, exhilarating, and just overall fun. Some might get turned off by the shaky cameras, but my thought is that it's much like the camera in Quantum of Solace; you can still tell what's going on, so it's not too much of a problem. My favorite action scene is in the streets of Paris when Duke and Ripcord use their accelerator suits.However, apart from the cheesiness that only fans of the cartoon will love, it still has its flaws.My first problem is with the performances. Channing Tatum is very wooden as Duke; I would've preferred someone a little more sparky to play Duke. I also thought Baroness looked and acted way too innocent; she's like a sissy, Lohan-esquire soldier wannabe. I also thought Destro's voice didn't really sound right; he didn't have the epic, villainy voice he had in the cartoon; he just sounded foreign.... and that's it.I also thought some of the plot lines were pretty pointless. The cartoon always stayed on one storyline per mini series, and this movie could've done that as well. Unfortunately, we get a love story between Duke and Baroness, a backstory for Snake Eyes, and some weird plot line involving the president, leading to a pointless cliffhanger ending.I also didn't like the last fifteen minutes of the movie. At that point, the villains look retarded, their capture is anti-climatic, and, again, it all ends on that pointless cliffhanger.Still, I was satisfied by this film for what it was; cheesy, flashy, action-packed fun, just like the cartoon. It's not that good, but I enjoyed it. 7/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

That being said I was perfectly willing to check this out and give it the benefit of the doubt. I am, in the least, familiar with the characters.While I'm aware this isn't on par with a film like Shawshank Redemption, the dialogue and acting were awful. Horrid. If there was an anti-Oscar, the actors here would win 'em all.I chalk it all up to Stephen Sommers. After all he directed Van Helsing, another piece of complete tripe.Rent the DVD when it comes out if you want a semi-solid (bowel movement) popcorn night on the sofa.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
337,dannytomasso,"so much money, so little value",5,27 August 2009,"It always amazes me how so much money can produce such poor results. A movie like this has a budget that can help many countries out of recession and still, it produces mediocre results. How and why? I have never been a big fan of Dennis Quaid, I have to say, but in this movie he was really bad. He resembled a robot with a speech impediment and a slow processing microchip. The acting in general was mediocre at best. This movie managed to put me off almost immediately; there was so much build up about how the GI Joes are the best of the best, the secret weapon, the supermen, blah, blah.only to be made minced meat in a matter of minutes by a good looking chick and her well equipped and trained crew! I thought that GI Joes are the best, are ""when everything else fails""! OK, let's get over this first attack, maybe it took them by surprisehahaha, surprise for the best of the best, yeah, right! How about the same good looking chick and her team penetrating the very core of GI Joes, their own base and stealing the weapons and getting away? What!? Are these GI Joes some trainees from the Iraq Police or the cream of the crop? And although the GI Joes have fantastic weapons and superman like suits, they ""forget"" to use them in defending their own base??? Wow! I cannot comment on everything, but I want to make one other point that bothers me in many movies, car chases. Two GI Joes in accelerator suits cannot catch a HUMMER (all be it a supped up one and having a front plow) going through city traffic?! Really? Anybody on a scooter or a motorbike can catch a Hummer in a few seconds, especially in traffic. What is it with the directors not understanding the capabilities of vehicles? That is why we, as viewers are so enchanted when a director gets it right like in Bullitt or Ronin or The Driver. In so many movies I see extremely fast cars not being able to get away from cops and slow cars not being caught. I recommend that the directors hire more competent research teams on this matter which makes their movies more realistic or less realistic. And also take a drive through traffic more often! This is all I had to add, because so many other commentators were so eloquent in catching the bad and the good point of this movie",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
338,james-3248,Lets hope Michael Bay directs the sequel,1,27 December 2011,"to make a film out of an action figure is Cinematographic suicide, G I Joe is a toy for children 20 years ago but this film is a film for people 200 years ago. Only then would people be amazed at the stupid amount of cgi and the fact the pictures were moving. All other aspects of the film were diabolical. Hasbro stop making cgi porn out of childhood toys, they make Cinema terrible. This film obviously spawned from the success of Transformers, I am surprised Michael Bay didn't direct this film. At least Transformers didn't have Channing Tatum in the lead role. Channing Tatum is one of the worst actors along with Vin Diesel and Jason Statham. He can only act in action movies because they consist 99% of explosions and punching stuff. He probably made up his script up along the way because it's hardly likely that he can read. The rest of the acting should have been good since the rest of the cast is good but their acting is a joke and I am not surprised they are not returning for the sequel. As for the plot... Yeah about that, they forgot to make one. So it seems like they attempted to improvised.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
339,IronBob,Summer pulp only,4,22 October 2009,"I figured I would hate this movie and I was disappointed. I didn't actually hate it but one thing that hit me right out of the gate was how horribly miscast everyone was. I liked the action scenes, in fact some of the best of the year but I can't remember a movie so woefully miscast. Not one single character in this movie had an ounce of believability with Karolina Kurkova MAYBE coming close to respectability but the rest are just fake Barbie girls with no connection to reality at all. Dennis Quaid as General Hawk? Puhleeze.Now as to the story, it wasn't horrible but it's the same old crap we're always given. Weapons maker makes super weapon for the good guys, sells it to the bad guys, makes a lot of money but as usual has an ulterior motive--come on, that theme has been done to DEATH.What kills me about Hollywood is they still want to use super models as bad asses and though they're totally fun to look at with all those finely tuned jiggly parts, they lend an air of silliness to any flick trying to appear real.

No, but it's not horrible either. This is simply a fun action adventure bringing to life a childhood cartoon/toy favorite.I'm neither a die hard fan of the show, nor the comics, so whatever changes they made with backgrounds etc I didn't notice or mind. I grabbed a MR. Pibb, sat down, and enjoyed the ride.And there is nothing wrong with that. They packed a lot into this movie, and I enjoyed just about every minute of it. Laughs, action, and gun fights, 3 things essential to a good action flick.If you want your more serious combat movies, watch Private Ryan, or other such material. This is just a fun ride, and I think with the state of everything in the world right now, some simple fun is much needed.The critics who can't stand these types of movies...well, they just shouldn't watch them. Please tell me I'm not the only one tired of hearing them bad mouth action movies, and talk in critic language that the average reader doesn't fully understand.GI Joe is not the pinnacle of anything cinematic to be sure.

A lot like Stephen Sommers previous movies.Pros: The movie is very action packed. The futuristic weapons and vehicles are pretty cool. The action scenes are pretty intense and there are lots of them. Ray Park should be in any movie that has a sword fight. The guy is awesome.The movie, like Transformers, brings out the 8 year old boy in me when I see it. Even though it seemed quite different than the cartoons, I knew which character was which.They made Rachel Nichols (Scarlett) and Sienna Miller (Baroness) look very sexy. Which of course was the point of hiring those two actresses.Cons: The plot. They could have done something better with the plot. All of that technology that the Joes have and they didn't notice a fortress was being built under the arctic. Just a tad unbelievable. Also, when Snake Eyes is under the car, why didn't he shoot out the tires sooner. He was under there for a while. Some of the plot was a bit over the top.The acting: Very cheesy and mostly unbelievable.But all in all, I really liked the movie. It won't win any awards but it is a fun ride.",G.I.

As a fan of the old GI Joe (before the flashy names and Power Ranger outfits), I knew next to nothing about the characters going in. This actually had the potential to be a GREAT movie but fell completely flat. The pace was fast, very fast, extremely fast, ungodly fast from start to finish within only a millisecond quip from Marlon Wayans before returning to yet another fast paced action sequence. There was no rhythm at all. What little breaks they did take from the action were filled with pathetic melodrama, pointless flashbacks, horrible CGI, and ridiculous plot Black Holes that left the characters and audience chasing their tails.In the end I was so desensitized by the relentless action sequences that I found myself yawning during what should have been the climax of the story. Poor writing, poor directing, poor effects, and poor acting (credit to Marlon Wayans for a somewhat enjoyable performance) left me wondering what $170,000,000 was actually spent on.Cut the characters in half, simplify the story, and chop out 30 minutes and it could have been one of the best action movies this year.It's not the worse film ever made (6/10) but it has to be one of the worse films made for over $150,000,000.",G.I.

345,cwillson,A plastic cartoon of a movie with 12-year-old gamer's view of the world,3,8 August 2009,"This movie is a 12-year-old video-gamer's view of the world. If you can get into that head-space, you may enjoy this, If you are looking for plot which makes sense, or characters you care about, or any kind of logic, you will be disappointed. I was concerned when I heard they refuse to screen this for critics, and knew I had stepped in it when Hasbro got the first screen credit. Yes, it is a plastic cartoon of a movie, where good guys and bad both change their stripes, where the ""tip of the spear"" of the evil assault force is a hot chick (Sienna Miller) in a tight leather cat suit (and even women's uniforms are tight, and hot), where throwing stars are devastatingly lethal weapons (and every team needs their own Ninja), while bullets don't do much, and where you don't need to know anything about technology, nanotechnology, aircraft, or weapons to write it into the story. Here, unbelievably stupid weapons are the norm, the military isn't competent to protect their most powerful weapon for even 15 minutes, soldiers have beards and go AWOL to join a better unit on their own, the GI Joe military installation is appointed like a luxury spa, impossible aircraft ignore the laws of physics, and are designed with engines on the wingtips, and a soldier (not assigned to a flying MOS) can jump in and fly a cutting edge jet he has never even seen to save the world,  the list is endless. To the pre-teen brain, this probably works. But enjoying a movie involves either a willing suspension of disbelief, or a good yarn embracing its transgressions in good fun. This one simply did not work for me. But if you are a major GI Joe fan who already knows you will like seeing some old friends, this may be a real treat for you, since that seems to be the basis of the positive reviews here. But for the rest of us, this is a very marginal and disappointing movie, and you may loose all interest in the characters long before the half-way point.

346,bnbrossman,"Some good, some bad, but it wasn't G.IJoe",5,23 August 2009,"I was generally disappointed with this movie, and I did give it a fair chance.Rather than be GI Joe, the team should instead be called the Minori-team. They aren't real American heroes because most of them aren't American, hell, their base isn't even in America, it's in Egypt with the stereotypical camel guy stalking around it's entrance. The whole franchise had been based off of, ""GI Joe, the Real American Heroes"".This movie at times actually seemed more like a spoof of the old TV show than it was an action movie relaunch of the franchise. It reminds me of the P.O.S. Trek Trek 'relaunch' they did a bit ago. Why do they even bother? They actually did a cool and creative thing with Cobra Commander, though. He turns out to be who everyone thinks is Dr. Mindbender, but is in reality someone else. He's been horribly disfigured by a bunker explosion he and the not-so-good Dr. were in together, but they never do say what happened to the real Mindbender. He's on a respirator device like Darth Vader and later reveals he's wearing a wig. Sadly they then screw this up at the end of the movie by making him put on a ridiculous looking mask that makes him sound like a white guy trying to be James Earl Jones doing Darth Vader on a bad day.Yeah, apparently the spoof for this movie was already made by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, it's called 'Team America'. You're better off watching that as it was much more entertaining with far better writing. Kim Jong Il's performance in that movie was absolutely breathtaking. As for GI Joe, the Rea... er...

I would much prefer watching a mindless action flick like Transformers then sitting through an Oscar nominated film, any day. So when I walked into the theatre for GI:Joe that's exactly what I was expecting.I mindless action flick with lots of explosions and awesome stunts to entertain me and overcompensate for the lack-lustre script.Unfortunately what I saw was EMPHASIS on the mindless.The script is extremely incoherent and riddled with so many plot holes that it seems the screenwriters just gave u half way through and rushed to finish. The dialogue is also very heavy-handed and filled with clichés, taking the little realism left out of the film.Two soldiers are ambushed by an evil elite corporation while trying to deliver warheads and end up recruited by the GI:Joe's to get them back. Seems simple enough, unfortunately the writers make it much more difficult and convoluted then it needs to be. Each character has a deep history with one of the bad guys, histories that must be displayed through tiresome flashbacks that halt the action and entertainment.Sienna Miller also is not intimidating at all playing the Evil Leader as she doesn't do anything that evil. I guess to the writers standing around in black leather cat-suits, a painfully fake wig, and making little quips equals evil genius. The big reveal of who the ""real"" evil genius is also contradicts everything we've seen until that point as it raises countless questions to why Sienna Miller is even there.The acting is also atrocious with Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols providing some of the only half-decent performances.I'm sure a lot of you are expecting these to be the negative aspects, but at least the special effects are great, right? WRONG! The special effects are incredibly unimpressive, most of it looking like something out of a video game circa 2002. Some scenes are entirely CGI, which look particularly fake.While all-in-all my low expectations for this film were highly lowered. I've seen worse films. It's the type of film you're not going to enjoy and want to see again, but your not going to absolutely despise either. That said, if you're looking for an action flick, go for Transformers.

The film is riddled with chunky badly designed and badly created props and costumes with the exception of the non-futuristic military costumes. the design of all the machines was not practical and everything that has to be piloted looks like the pilots are riding those terrible low-to-the-ground, three-wheeled, green machine bicycles. To add to that 95% of the CG was terrible especially for this era of CG imagery.The things that were good about the film is the fight choreography which at some points was brilliant and.... no that's all.The writing was very bad, the characters were badly written, the dialogue is incredibly cheesy, and there are subtle racist and political aspects throughout the entire film, mainly revolving around the Comic relief black character ""Ripcord"". One thing that i picked up on was that the president in the film held a resemblance to John McCain, an elderly, balding, white haired man, perhaps a statement as to what the Stephen Sommers thought should have happened?, i don't really know because I'm an Australian, but that's what i picked up.Also when you see the ending of the film you will notice MANY MANY MANY scenes directly stolen from Star Wars: A New Hope, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back which i found extremely annoying, if they were just little nods, then fine but no they were directly stolen, what a stupid film to steal from it's only one of the largest and most recognizable franchises in history.",G.I.

349,thenaomiest,No. Just no. It was bad.,2,6 September 2009,"What a shocker of a movie. Don't bother.Let me start off with something nice to say... Visually it was a good looking film. The effects looked great. Most of the fights scenes were reasonably well done.Now to the bad = all of the rest of it. The plot was ridiculous. The villains reeked of that 80's cartoon scariness. He must be evil because he's got a deep voice and laughs evilly. No real other substance to them.Women were objectified and sexualised in this movie. It seems it would be a shock to Hollywood sum of a woman is not just as eye candy or to ""belong"" to a man.Whenever Anna acts violently, it's always sexualised. She's flirting with or kissing her victim. Her top is unzipped enough for the cleavage money-shot.C'mon movie makers, give your viewers some credit! It's not just guys that go to see these movies. Women enjoy action movies, you don't have to insult us in the process.It's unrealistic that Anna is taking revenge on her ex-fiancé. It's supposed to be Duke's fault that her brother died IN A WARZONE!? Stupid. No normal person would hold him accountable, even if she did asked Duke to take care of her brother, she could never expect Duke to forfeit his duties just to protect him. Dumb.Racist undertones where present too. Apart from the black guy being a complete stereotype - you know it's pretty bad when part of his diologue is ""I'm the black guy, I..."" Are they kidding? Not worth watching. 2 Stars.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
350,rugby_rox_09,absolutely terrible,1,12 August 2009,"This movie was horrible, absolutely horrible. It could have been good if it had made any sense at all. It could have been good if anyone on the creative team had decided to actually look some info up. It seems like they did all their research through Uncyclopedia or something.The acting was beyond bad, with no real dialogue, just cheesy one liners. That's it. Not to mention the final battle, which rips off star wars so much I almost expected Admiral Ackbar to bust out with some lines. Here are a few others things, and let me know if these make any goddamn sense: 1) Cobra steals warheads that they manufactured, and then takes them to a particle accelerator to be weaponized. First and foremost, did anyone even bother to look up what a particle accelerator was? Did they even consider that all you need to do to weaponize warheads is give them the arming codes? It's not even like it was difficult to find this info out...2) For some reason, all the military units in this movie use Civvie hummers instead of military Humvees. It makes absolutely no sense. -1/10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Marlon Wayne came as a surprise . the comedy was done well . but aside from all that . its sienna miller who steals the spotlight and spot for one of the sexiest villainess in films .the CGI's weren't bad either .. the Paris piece is definitely a great set piece is the best .overall a great fun film to watch if your looking for a escape from reality . not the best film . not the worst either .",G.I.

Dora is smarter. Transformers at least was average. Same with Terminator. But this is something else. The acting is poor, the visuals inconsistent, the script/screenplay atrocious... and I think the only good thing about this film is Snake Eyes. At least HE didn't have to say anything besides jump around and hack and slash. Parents, do yourself a favor, and take your kids to G-Force instead. Also, I didn't mention the overall direction. It's bad too. I will repeat, Transformers 2 and Terminator S. is WAY better than this piece of trash. The score, effects, acting, bad direction, and whatnot makes this movie the worst Sci-Fi film of the year.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
353,The_big_mick,"Cobra Rises, and G.I. Joe Fans Are Left Pumped!",10,8 August 2009,"I've always been a HUGE G.I. Joe fan (Cobra Commander being my all time favorite villain). So to see this movie hit the big screen was like Christmas in August. Some may see me as being a bit biased, but honestly, a good movie is a good movie. Great action, good plot, and great characters from our youth...what's not to love? Theatre was packed for opening night and from the reaction of the audience, they loved it. One guy a couple seats down from me was screaming his head off every time a big action scene started. And why wouldn't he? The fight scenes were awesome.Characters were well portrayed as well. I especially liked Storm Shadow because he was ruthless and badass. Acted first, asked questions later (if at all). His chemistry with Snake Eyes was terrific. Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a good job as well as the manipulative Doctor/Rex. Everyone did a great job.And at the end, they set up the sequel in, what I consider, PERFECT fashion. A great movie all in all, and then to have such an amazing cliff hanger was just icing on the cake. Guaranteed, that will draw a ton of people to the sequel.I had to give this movie a 10, because it was the first movie I've seen in theatres in a LONG time that I actually really enjoyed. Sat through Wolverine, hated it. Sat through Transformers, hated it. Watchmen and Star Trek were pretty good, I admit, but this blew them away. Take the 10 bucks or however much it is and go see this movie.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
354,cizewski5,Great Movie except messed up Storm Shadow Story,8,7 August 2009,"Especially if you read the pre-book, the twists near the end give you a big WOW, something I didn't expect.I was just expecting a fun action movie with some nostalgic value from my childhood and it delivered so much more.The only seen that I really didn't like was the chase seen they show you so much of in the commericals. It was too long, and didn't really do much for the story, they could have edited 10 minutes out of it and the movie would actually have been better. But then again, it's GI Joe, so you have to have some hochiness...HOWEVER, what could almost made me give this a 5 was the whole Storm Shadow story. The true story is great, and Zartan is in the movie. The real story is so much better then what they came up with and it would not have taken any more time to tell. That's my review without spoilers, don't read on if you don't like spoilers ... spoiler alert.... Don't continue any more if you don't want a spoiler.They kill Storm Shadow????????????? Or at least they make it look very much like they do. Hopefully in the next movie he comes out of the ice water, you can't kill Storm Shadow, Snake Eyes would NEVER do that. For true Gi Joe fans, this leaves a very, very soar taste in our mouths.The twists with the Baroness being Dukes ex-girlfriend and cobra commander being Dukes ex-girlfriends supposedly dead brother almost make up for killing Storm Shadow. But killing one of the best characters of all time never makes sense.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
355,kaysmj,Fun Fun Fun! Looking forward to a sequel!,8,7 November 2009,"I never like these kinds of actions movies that rely so much on the special effects, but I LOVED this one. Having read the mostly scathing reviews I was prepared to hate it, but as the movie progressed from one awesome action sequence to the next, I kept thinking WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? The special effects are incredible, as is the photography, the score, and even the somewhat campy acting seems appropriate. It is X-men, Transformers, and Spider Man all rolled into one. It was reported that G.I. Joe cost something like $170 million to make; IT SHOWS! Ignore the critics(including the wannabe critics here); this one is pure fun for all ages!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
356,Styrophoamicus,A Kitchen-Sink Action Movie (That Works!),7,15 August 2009,"I've never really cared for the G.I. Joe series. I've never had a single action figure or even watched a single episode of the TV series. To me, it always felt like it was over-americanized (Webster's can now add that to the dictionary) pap. So imagine my shock when I first saw the trailer for G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and thought to myself afterwards, 'Hey, that looks pretty cool'. And pretty cool it was. Paramount received a bit of backlash for not doing a pre-screening for film critics, instead choosing to focus on internet critics. And to me, I think that's a smart move, one which film companies should do more often. There's obvious differences between film and internet critics: I mean, just compare the scores for this film on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. If anything, internet critics are more in tune with popular culture than film critics, and are not afraid to let us know that. It seems like every review I've read from an internet critic has been very positive for this film, and almost all of them contain a sentence or two about how this film reminds them of playing with action figures as a kid. And to be honest I think that's the kind of mindset you have to have when going into this film. If you're expecting a gritty, deep, meaningful and complex film (a'la The Dark Knight), then don't even go near this film. But if you're expecting a thrilling, entertaining, and nearly psychotic edge of your seat escape- film (a'la a 10 year old with ADHD and a massive sugar rush playing with toys in a sandbox) then go buy your ticket now. So, with all that, here's my thoughts on the film. G.I. Joe is definitely a 'Why Not' movie. Secret agents? Why not? Underwater city? Why not? Underground drilling pods? Can't think of a reason not to! While we're at it, lets throw in some ninjas and lasers! AND EXPLOSIONS! AND MAD SCIENTISTS! MUAHAHAHA! It's basically a big, fat crepe stuffed and bursting with everything you love about action movies. It's gloriously over-the-top, yet never once did I find myself thinking 'Yeah, right' or asking 'Why?'. It's a kitchen sink action movie that works. Whereas the non-stop action of Transformers 2 made me feel numb and, dare I say, BORED, G.I. Joe never once had me coming close to any of that. I think out of all the movies thus far based on toys, G.I. Joe is the only one that actually understands that it's a movie based on toys, with its tongue firmly planted in its cheek, ad therefore refuses to take itself too seriously. It replicates and then magnifies the feeling of playing with a mess of toys on your bedroom floor: you don't think about plausibility or practicality: the world needs saving, and you and your small army of plastic soldiers are going to do it! Except instead of plastic soldiers we have real people now, and unlike the fermented tripe that was Transformers 2, G.I. Joe actually kept me interested and actually made me care for some of its characters, even though some of them border on cookie-cutter (sorry, Ripcord). About halfway through the film I noticed that quite a few flashback sequences had passed me by, and furthermore they were flashbacks for secondary characters. I stopped to wonder, 'Do we really need to know about the past of a mute, masked ninja?'. But then it hit me: 'Why not?'. The flashbacks, while not necessary, show that director Stephen Sommers is at least trying to add some gravitas to his numerous characters. Another thing that caught me off guard is that this film isn't trying to be so patriotic its crapping out stars and stripes like so many Hollywood action films of late. In fact, it's almost the exact opposite of that. Whereas Spiderman 3 waved a coincidentally placed screen-sized American flag in our faces while the hero runs dramatically past it, G.I. Joe (once with the tagline 'A Real American Hero') decides to put all that fluffy nonsense aside and instead focus on blowing up and shooting anything that has the audacity to get in its way. We don't have characters reminding us ever 10 minutes that they're American, unlike Night At The Museum 2, and even the trademark red, white, and blue stripes on the logo are gone, leaving behind only a small metallic star. The measure of the heroes success is greatly determined by the evilness of the villains, and I think what makes the villains from G.I. Joe stand out from, say, the villains in almost EVERY SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OUT THERE, is that they aren't bloody incompetent. They kill people, they blow stuff up, if there's a chance to off one of the good guys, they take it, and blow some more stuff up while they do it. OK, so McCullen's motivation is a bit thin, to say the least (He builds a vast underwater complex and manufactures ultra-tech weapons so he can... avenge his family name? Why Not?!) but both he and The Doctor are the type of villains you like to hate. Surprisingly, the film is well cast. The only person that comes off as a bit weak is Christopher Eccleston as McCullen, the supposed evil genius; thankfully, by the end, we all know who the real evil genius is, and He. Is. Awesome. Unlike the apparently Aryan-approved cast of beautiful white people (ok, and one comic relief Latino and a ruff-and-gruff black soldier with barely any lines) from Transformers 2, the cast and characters of G.I. Joe are quite varied, which is something quite refreshing to see these days; and for God's sake they managed to make the French look cool! That's pretty much a feat on its own! Final Rating: 7 MacGuffin-Tech Nano Missiles out of 10",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
357,ike74ph,Better than Expected,7,7 August 2009,"It was better than expected. It was not as mind-numbing as Transformers 2 was and it had a more believable story. It had some background stories for the characters. What I didn't like was the past connection of Duke and Baroness. It was also exacerbated by Baroness being subjected to mind control. I felt it was an unnecessary part of the plot.Nevertheless, it had better action and fight scenes than Transformers 2. It also had fantastic headquarters for both sides.With how the movie ended, I think we need to watch its sequel to see how the characters evolved.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
358,blahby123456,My Take,4,3 October 2013,"The problem with this movie for me is I grew up watching the G.I. Joe cartoons of the 1980's so I tend to compare this to the cartoons. With that said, this movie is rather entertaining but there are a few things I didn't like. These include: First, General Hawk wasn't portrayed as very confident and didn't exude leadership qualities as I felt he should. Second, as per the cartoon, Ripcord should be white, not black. Third, Scarlett and Duke are supposed to be a couple, not Scarlett and Ripcord and Duke and the Baroness. Fourth, I so did not like their choice for the Cobra Commander and Destro. Destro is supposed to be a strong, confident confidant of the commander. Fifth, why did Covergirl have to die? Anyway, despite all this, I still enjoy this movie. It was entertaining despite what I feel was a weak story line. The action was pretty cool, not too over-the-top but adequate. I did like some of the technology utilized in this movie, despite it being sci-fi for now.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
359,big_malique,Not that bad ...,7,8 August 2009,"I walked in to this movie, with no expectations what so ever. I had seen the trailers and like all modern day action flicks it had failed to put it's claws on me. It looked more CGI than anything else. SO when the movie stared I was expecting it to go from bad to worse but funny enough it never got to that point.I mean the acting is bad, the dialogue is cliché, the outfits seem ridiculous there is completely no storyline. but somehow the movie holds on and paces along quite nicely. The action sequences are beautifully done and the movie entertains where it should. The viewer get treated to the latest technology in CGI but I never had the feeling of being draped into too much of it. So let's be honest. This movie doesn't want to be the next Dark Knight, on the contrary it delivers the goods just as promised by the trailers. This movie sets out to be a thorough entertainer and that's exactly what it does. It might not be accurate to the original storyline, but it doesn't need to be. Because if it were, there'd be people bitching about that. If you're looking for some brainless entertainment on a boys night out than go ahead it's definitely worth it's price.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
360,michalchik,Weak,2,13 August 2009,"I couldn't make it through this movie. I got my money back about halfway through. I didn't give it a 1 because the effects and action were almost competent and the opening was kind of cool, but even these the strongest points of the movie were still weak. We have seen it all before and better. It is obvious they spent money on this film, but the plot is contrived (I'll avoid spoilers), every action sequence is telegraphed and then rubbed in you face. You see each stunt coming a mile away (sometimes literally). The acting is wooden. The characters are caricatures, less that one dimensional. I won't even begin to go into how bad the science, technology, geopolitics, etc.. of the movie is.I know, people aren't supposed to take a movie like this seriously, but its hard to play along when things get this ridiculous. If this was a Saturday morning cartoon it might be worth the price of admission and little kids might not see the glaring weaknesses, but this is a big budget movie and they should have tried harder. Cartoons can be made into good movies, the Transformers worked, Iron Man worked. This movie belongs on the trash heap alongside the He-Man movie and Cat Woman. If you watch all the trailers you have seen anything worth seeing in the movie. OK, I admit since I didn't make it to the end I don't know that for sure, but it is not worth the risk.",G.I.

361,klarue72,"Average, at best.",7,7 August 2009,"I was 9 years old when I was first introduced to GI JOE, now I am 35. This movie was made for my 9 year old counter-part, not my 35 year old present self. This movie is not as lame as Transformers 2, but make no mistake, it is no Full Metal Jacket either. Think shallow and bubble gum when you go to see it and you won't be disappointed, that much. Typical Hollywood clichés and dialog are all over this flick, as well as lame special effects. Sienna Miller is NOT convincing as one of the baddest bad chicks ever. She didn't even have the classic baroness french/swiss/what ever it was accent. However, The movie wasn't a total loss. McClellen/destro was well acted, as was Stormshadow, and I guess Zartan as well. The plot was easy to follow. Snakeeyes vs. StormShadow fights were cool. Gadgets were cool (even though cgi itself was weak) Gi Joe is a big B movie. Just keep that in mind and you will be OK. Oh, hit me up on youtube: Klane Crew",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
362,dirtza,Makes Revenge of the Fallen look like a Best Picture winner...,5,27 August 2009,"I just don't get it. Stephen Sommers ""bounces back"" from the colossal disaster Van Helsing, only to give us something worse. The fact that this piece of s**t took $170 million to make is more talked about than the movie itself, and for good reason. When you spend that much money on a film it usually at least looks like money well spent, despite Sommers (look what the same studio Paramount did with $30 million Cloverfield). Guess what, writing doesn't cost that much money, and clearly there was no real effort in that department. Why, when you can spend some of that money on insane practical stunts and create memorable sequences like some other directors do, would you spend it on creating bases under polar ice caps and the sands of Egypt, which look like cartoon sequences edited into live - action? The CGI was BAD, very bad. The action was (as expected) non stop, stereotype and irritating. The stunts were non – existent, as everything was CG. The women kick more arse than everyone else. The Paris sequence was pretty much everything you see in the trailers and clips, disappointing when you see the whole thing instead of quick cuts. It was always obvious that this film would hide a lack of substance with style, but quite frankly it was not very stylish. Snake Eyes is sadly immensely under used, Channing Tatum is the worst actor I've seen since Hayden Christensen, pathetic musical score, pathetic dialogue and attempts at humor even from the usually – funny Marlon Wayans, completely non – memorable performances from everyone else, Dennis Quaid might as well have not been in the movie, for everyone who's watched the trailers and exclusive clips, that's pretty much all there is in the movie. It is, at best, pathetic (even by Stephen Sommers summer blockbuster standards). Hard to think Stuart Beattie could write a screenplay this bad, you'll see what I'm talking about if you're unfortunate enough to watch the characters' so – called ""back stories"" and the now requisite ""leading onto a sequel"" ending. Cheesy, cheap - looking (which I still cannot comprehend), not cool, worse than sister concern Revenge of The Fallen, and I have a horrible feeling Stephen Sommers may have destroyed a potentially mind – blowing franchise even before it kicks off. Since every other franchise seems to be doing it these days, who knows, maybe a ""reboot"" with another director? Unheard of for a second film, I know, but this is how bad it is and I do not want to see it die before it's born. Saving grace (if there is such a thing for this film):Ray Park as Snake Eyes (his costume more than anything, since they wasted his presence and potential) Brendan Fraser's second – long cameo, which I personally enjoyed more than the whole movie, the concepts in the movie, which sadly were taken to a Sommers – ish level in terms of execution & Sienna Miller & Rachel Nichols (not their pathetic ten - second fight sequence)",G.I.

363,MrWillyWonka,Like the cartoon... but ALIVE!!,6,31 July 2009,"Exactly what it (should have) set out to be, nothing more and nothing less. Probably the highest ""explosion to line of dialogue"" ratio in the history of movies. Channing Tatum is terrible, apparently as always, but I believe this was my first (in)opportunity to see him in action. Dennis Quaid is very Quaidy, I think I saw Brendan Fraser in there for about 14 seconds doing absolutely nothing (his best role ever!), Marlon Wayans was OK enough considering the nonsensical excuses for ""jokes"" he was enlisted to deliver.With the exception of way too many close-to-derailing-the-movie flashback sequences intended to flesh out the back-story but mostly amounting to nothing, the movie is nonstop EXTREMELY loud ridiculous action from start to finish. I venture this is a lot more akin to a live-action cartoon, closer in spirit to the original after-school animated series than the Transformers movies were to their respective source material. The real negative amounts to that very same, in fact, that the movie is ultimately devoid of any personality, which Michael Bay (at least attempted) to give the Transformers in monstrous, offensive spades. Stephen Sommers can pull off ridiculous nonsense well enough, but failed to inject it with enough personality to make it memorable. Transformers at least did that, though I suppose I'd rather a movie be unremarkable and straightforward than over the top, embarrassing, offensive nonsense. GI Joe is certainly the former.

Joe extreme I never stopped collecting the figures or reading the comics or loving the cartoon (which was a terrible show by the way) the movie was great they did real honor to snake and storms past, so what if scarlet flirts with Rip cord who should have been stalker but that's a creepy name and easy to see why they didn't use it. As far as the baroness and the commander being brother and sister BIG DEAL would you prefer he was a Cobra La.

Rest its derived from the comic stuff n supposed to be hypothetical, so all those complaining of the unreal things in the movie should stop criticizing. That is just expected!

366,stanleygoodspeed99,Cheezzzeee Ahoy!!!!,5,10 September 2009,"Now look, let's start by being honest, I was an avid fan of the G.I.Joe toys growing up, I was really looking forward to this film this was always going to be a cheesy action flick. There are right ways to do things and wrong ways to do things, however. Was there action? Sure, but what else did this movie offer? The answer, sadly, is not much.The basic premise is what is to be expected, G.I.Joe good, Cobra, the bad guys, bad. Surprise surprise, G.I.Joe end up having to save the world from the bad guys. There are a few clever items in the story and clever ideas and the way Cobra want to take over the world is at least a little original, but oh my golly gosh the acting and dialogue in this movie made me want to gouge out my eyes and deafen myself at the same time.Tatum wasn't the worst here. He wasn't great, but there were much worse actors. Quaid just doesn't suit the part. You can't take him seriously as an actor and watching his performance you can't work out if he's parodying himself or what. Wayans copped probably the worst of the dialogue and delivered it just as poorly as it was written. I know it's supposed to be cheesy, but its nicer when you don't notice just how cheesy it is all the way through the movie.In summary, watch this movie if you're bored, you're a big action movie buff that doesn't watch movies for the dialogue or story and there is nothing left to rent at the DVD store. Definitely don't take it seriously when you do.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Ninjas were awesome. WAYYY too much slow motion. the acting was average some were good some sucked...(duke). dialogue and interactions generic and totally stock. a lot of the movie coulda been avoided had someone kill someone instead of just wounding them. (seriously i don't care who you are...but if your a ""bad guy"" there's no way you're not gonna blast good guys when you get the chance) also (for those that watched it duke shoulda shot her at least in the leg at some point) so overall in terms of quality film making it was about a 4 or 5 in terms of it being entertaining...meh ill give it a high 6 or 7",G.I.

368,SDockorockerty_MarkII,A great summer movie,8,7 August 2009,"This summer has been sorely lacking an adrenaline pumping fun summer movie after Star Trek was released. I think Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a good example - this was a film that saw fit to leave out the most exciting and action packed part of the entire book and this pretty much sums up this summer for me. This summer has been very weak for movies and this is shown in the box office which has severely cooled down since the roaring start to the year we witnessed. Well thank goodness for GI Joe: Rise of Cobra, it promised thrills and it certainly delivered. Its fully deserving of an 8 score and was a very good summer action movie in a summer severely lacking action.What was good:-The action scenes were superbly choreographed and unlike some other movies recently they kept my interest and I didn't find my eyes glazing over. -The characters were all very watchable (bar one who I will mention later on) and Sienna Miller was so incredibly hot! (I know that sounds juvenile and maybe it is..but let me repeat - SIENNA MILLER IS HOT!) -The dialogue was perfectly fitting, it may have been cheesy but it was fun and perfectly fit the shiny and light tone to the whole movie. -The movie incorporates several flashbacks that tell us more about the characters, not only were these well done but they actually managed to not break up the pace of the movie and are very well incorporated. -The production design - The costumes, the computer programmes used by the Joes and the baddies all look great.The few flaws -Channing Tatum's acting was fairly atrocious and I never believed he was his character, when I saw him I saw him as Channing Tatum on a set reading his lines. Luckily he didn't actually have to say much. -The CGI is fairly substandard which does taint some of the scenes, although to be fair you can see where the budget went (unlike Harry Potter 6 and its $250mil budget, I don't know what they were doing with their funds) and there are many great action setpieces.All in all, I can only say one thing that will hopefully encourage you to go see this film - I left the cinema with a smile on my face. And when it comes to summer flicks like this, that's all that really matters.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
369,velocityboy-2,"Marketed Well, Delivered Poorly",3,2 September 2009,"Based on the trailer, I expected a fun low-expectations movie, but got neither. It was lower than low. This movie fails on 3 main ingredients pertinent to its success: Acting, Special effects, and Action. With no charisma and embarrassingly overused cheesy lines, the lead roles quickly became a burden to endure throughout the movie. As a genre comparison, take Wovlerine and Transformers (the first only) whose characters albeit teetering on the brink of cheesiness were interesting and fun to watch.Failing in the acting, I hoped the special effects would bring some excitement to the screen. Unfortunately they were cartoony and instantly noticeable when they were used in the scene. Noticeable and distracting in the way it didn't fit the expectations of timing and rendering required for believability/enjoyment.Touted for its action, the movie was mostly filled with the poor special effects mentioned and very little hand-to-hand combat. So all in all, there's a lot of explosions that aren't convincing, little actual fighting, and dull trite acting.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
370,jorgenmolijn,worst movie ever in my opinion,1,31 August 2009,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. Yes, I had low expectations. Yes, I like the occasional action-movie. Yes, I know it is based on action figures. But this was ridiculous. The story is so thin and basic with sub-plots that aren't interesting. For example, the love-story. That one is so cliché and obvious and if you want to make a good-old action movie, then why would you bother about a love story in the first place. All the story lines of the characters aren't very good either nor interesting. it is also very annoying when the film constantly switches between the present and a flashback. The action is OK, but it didn't always look good. The only scene I liked was in Paris in the suites and that is practically the only scene used for the trailer. Another bad point is that the story is sometimes very strange and also wrong. For example, the attack on the GI Joe base. Tha base was full of people training, working, etc. Exoect when they attacked, then there were only a couple of guys there. But after the attack, there were hundreds of people again... And why do you need a particle accelerator to arm a missile? And don't get me started on the one-liners that make half of the entire dialogue in the film. All in all just a lame movie that made me laugh... at the times where it was so bad it was ridiculous.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
371,snake-eater-888-495559,A cinematic turd!,1,11 January 2011,"Some films are poor, some are terrible and some are biblically awful. This film is the latter, in terms of quality its neck and neck with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Which for those who don't know is crap. Whats wrong with GI.Joe? well its narrative is utter nonsense, so much so that its not worth describing, what I will say is that it involves a terrorist group known of Cobra, whose motivation once revealed is laughable. Berfore I watched it I thought it looked terrible, one of the few reasons I decided to bother was because Sienna Miller is in it wearing a fetishistic catsuit. In this film the actors are not the problem, its the characters that suck. Now I know nothing about the GI.Joe universe, but the characters presented here were awful caricatures of heroes and villains, one was named 'Snake eyes' who chose never to speak, (for no reason!)you would think this a hindrance for a task force member. The battle scenes are littered with terrible CGI and mindless decisions by soldiers on both sides, There is also no sense of fear or peril for our 'heroes' to overcome. Also the twist revealed in the climax of the third reel is so contrived it makes you cringe. Due to its tastelessly forced creation of a new villain and ambiguous ending an equally bad sequel seems immanent. Why was this drivel green lit? Money. People have said ""Its based on a toy-line from the eighties, what do you expect?"" well I expect the writers to produce a decent narrative, considering that they have ready made characters to work with. In short this film is soulless trash with an enormous budget that could of been spent on a more worthwhile project.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
372,jonrpatrick,Gets worse the more you watch it.,4,31 July 2014,"** This MAY contain spoilers** As a fan of GI Joe from the 80's - I collected the comics and loved the cartoon - I was understandably hyped about this movie. And, to be honest, I was frustrated but enjoyed it when it was in theaters, and bought the DVD. Also saw the 2nd, and it's DVD as well. But I just re-watched it and I can't forgive how utterly horrible this is. Imagine the creators sitting around and trying to pick between updating the series, using original characters, making this a ""backstory"" movie (while having the Joes totally in existence), using near-future weapons, and along the way picking exactly ALL the wrong choices! The Baroness was in love with Duke, but went on to be 'bad'? A nano-weapon that needs a particle accelerator before it can be fired. Yeah, those are handy on the battlefield. You can inject people with this nano technology and make them robots with no fear (worthless soldiers). The good news, they made Cobra not complete pushovers. The first fight scene sets the stage that Cobra is professional, equipped with next-gen weapons, and highly efficient. Of course, Joe is a bit better. But some is just stupid. The sonic-wave guns Cobra has is so obviously used so the producers could have people being blown around like leaves. Those armored suits (which of course are ONLY worn by the 2 newest and rawest members of the Joes... duh) are just dumb and seriously unnecessary. If they're so great, why didn't they wear them in the final battle? And then the Baronness becomes good? And Cobra Commanders mask? What the HECK?? Destro's metal face comes in at the end but it's living metal? And he's a slave to The Commander? NO!!!! Sure, update the cartoon, but where are the fangs, the hiss tanks, the claws? Major Bludd? Dr. Mindbender was a genius and built like a brick house - not some wimpy weenie. Geez.... As I said, pick every BAD option to update and that's what they chose. What you're left with isn't a great action movie, with a boring final battle, bad science, it isn't a great Joe movie, poor character development, relationships that just don't work due to no chemistry. When the funniest part is the Baronness telling a lady in a building ""nice shoes"" - you know you're in for a bad ride. All is not terrible - thus the rating of 4 by me. Showing some back story as flashbacks is nice, making the Commander a science genius who knew Duke was pretty cool. The Baronness was honestly awesome and the best part of the movie. So very, very disappointed. One of those movies I absolutely believe I could have done better.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
373,Cyberik,Silly CGI fluff - but delicious such!,5,15 October 2011,"Abandon logic all ye who enter here! This is Hollywood's CGI-factory at high-speed. This movie does not aim to satisfy, only to gratify, and it does so quite well. The story is subordinate - the pace and the window dressing is everything. And the window dressing is actually quite nice.Usually the CGI in this kind of movie looks plastic and just gets in the way of itself. With G.I. Joe it's stepped up a notch and it delivers better than average. So if you like lots of explosions, furious tempo, choreographed fighting, fancy fantasy-sci-fi weapons and of course more CGI than the average Pixar flick, the G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra is probably your cup of tea.Disconnect your thinking and prepare to entertained. Oh, and don't worry about having to figure stuff out, the plot is self explanatory.",G.I.

375,Th3rdpwr,Holy mackeral! Racially insulting! -SPOILERS-,2,10 August 2009,"First, my grade is based on what I viewed as a thin story, largely, inane dialogue, and there not being an unpredictable moment in the film. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against such things as pure entertainment, but this movie lacked any sort of smarts or cleverness(which it seemed to have potential for); dragged down by more clichés than any in recent memory. Most notably the one of white male supremacy. Before getting ticked off, take a look: the two ""lead"" characters are 'Duke'(white guy) and the comedically hip 'Ripcord'(black guy); when introduced in the first action set piece, Duke chases down the main villainess and (in an initial misunderstanding) arrogantly stands up to 4 armed G.I. Joes, Ripcord was earlier incapacitated by one knife-wielding Joe; it's Duke who was invited into this elite band 4 years earlier, Duke who now tests in the top 1/2% of recruits, Ripcord is only invited in because his score combined with Duke's allows him to pass; the black guy doesn't make it of his own accord, but as an attachment to his white counterpart(anti-affirmative action folks would have a field day with this). Duke is the only recruit who's ever ""tagged"" martial arts expert 'Snakeyes' in a training match; Snakeyes, himself being that oldest of clichés, the white male who rises to martial arts supremacy in the Orient. Let's continue; during the chase through Paris, it's Ripcord who neglected to read the instructions for his enhancement suit, stumbling to the ground at least twice, he fails to stop his villain from taking down the Eiffel Tower, leaving up to Duke who successfully prevents further damage to Paris itself. Shortly, when the team is confronted by Paris authorities, in a show of bravado mirroring Duke's earlier successful one against the Joes, Ripcord is ""smacked down""; even following his triumph, in saving Washington D.C., this success in blunted by his arrest on the White House lawn. Tom Sawyer and Jim, Robinson Crusoe and Friday; admittedly not as bad as that, but running along the same vein. How did the producers get away with this? I do give them props for an on screen interracial kiss; America needs more of that, but it doesn't need this movie.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

The plot goes way over most' skills to reach the final level, but in everything: text lines, graphics, scene switches, it is nothing more than that, wrapped as a movie. And there it goes beyond my skills and my game console's possibilities, so thank you software team for making the movie. But on films in cinema I see through the end; when I had a controller I might have stopped on level 2 or 3, missing the inimitable rest of it, the levels I would never reach, but rather have missed on my cinema screen. So my points are for the game, the graphics and the special effects to make it splash, the actors' effort to make their puppets come alive a bit; for the film as a film I should grant unsupported negative points.",G.I.

True, at least this year...",5,7 August 2009,"Forget about how stupid some lines can get (and that's a difficult one, with things like ""Nice shoes"" or ""that's the first fight I've ever lost since I was five"" or even when Destro actually becomes Destro). Forget about the annoying habit every character has of explaining every single part of the plot. Forget about how cliché or unimportant the newly introduced characters can be (For the Love of Bono, they have names like Dr. Mindbender and Heavy Duty!!!) Forget about how predictable and even disappointing the end can get. Done? OK, now you can actually enjoy G.I: Joe: Rise of Cobra! You see, the important thing about ROC is that they KNOW this isn't meant to be taken seriously. It's just harmless fun. Last time I went to look for that, I was shocked by one of the worst movies I've ever seen: Transformers 2:ROTF. And this year has been A Series of Unfortunate Events if I ever saw one: Wolverine, Terminator, Transformers. Definitely, a year to forget. Sure there have been masterpieces like Star Treak and Watchmen (I loved them both, so you may be, by now, beginning to understand what's the difference between you and me on movie tastes), but ROC is the first DUMB movie of the year that is actually good.So how can I have liked ROC and hated ROTF if they are pretty much the same movie? Well, yea ROC has everything Transformers had, but done in the correct way. Explotions, action? Check. And these look good enough, not the metal orgy you had on ROTF. Hot chicks? Check, and on waaaay more likable characters than the overrated Megan Fox or the Terminatrix (yes, the one that appears on Transformers). Comedy? Check, still kinda stupid and stuff but not offensive and racist as ROTF. Cartoon characters? Check. And not nearly as obnoxious and idiotic as Shia's excuse of a troubled teenager.It's just a ride.

Being a Fan of GI JOE since I was a little boy I didn't want to go in there and see a flop like Micheal Bay did with Transformers. Don't Get me wrong Transformers is good but it really ruins the original story and concepts of the original transformers. Anyway back to GI Joe. After watching it I have to say the transition from cartoon to movie wasn't bad at all. The director did a good job with the story line not making it to far fetched from the original. It also it more updated to the current time. There is a lot of action and a lot of Real American Heroes whooping Cobra butt!! Being a GI Joe fan all my life I would recommend this movie to even the hardcore fans. The only thing that really bothered me about the movie was the mask they gave cobra commander in the end. Sort of far fetched from the original masks we are used to seeing on the commander. Besides that tho, it really is an awesome movie. I give it 8 out of 10.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Just looking at wayans with the redhead, made me think of wayans in the white chicks. oh yeah! she looks like the wayans brother. well done casting....This movie would satisfy the young average movie goer, but if you're looking for a grittier gi joe, which from the recent trends of comic- movie adaptations was what i expected, this isn't it.

Has the famously used ship coming out from inside an explosion at the last minute. City saved at last minute be a hero who should die but its a film so they don't. That said. It's a decent film.

The so-called professional critics who obviously miss that point do not deserve their cushy jobs. The action is unbelievable, non-stop, breathless, and requires a total suspension of disbelief. The critics that have a problem with that should remember one thing. This is a movie based on a cartoon that's sole purpose was to sell a set of toys to 5-12 year old boys. Nothing more. Expecting ""War and Peace"" from this source material shows a lack of insight and intelligence from most of the reviews that I have read. If you like action films, you will enjoy this one.

The non-stop action and special effects were extremely well done. They did not rely on just one kind of effect, it was extremely inventive all the variations deployed.And i enjoyed the characters. They were credible and while there was a degree of stereotyped characters, they were totally reasonably genuine characters who you could relate to.Only complaints were that it was too long. 20 minutes could easily have been trimmed from this. Also, i just don't need to see exploding bodies and cruel agonizing things happening, or nearly happening, to people's heads. What is wrong with Director Sommers? Doesn't he realize that this is a PG-13 movie? Doesn't he know the demographics of who will attend this? Do 10-15 year olds need to see such things to enjoy the movie? In fact no one does - the movie is such an enjoyable high pitched action movie, that such graphic disturbing scenes, three in total, could have been left in but completely toned down and the movie would be the exact same.

It wasn't that bad!,6,26 February 2011,"OK.. so..the only reason I watched this film was because of Joseph Gordon-Levitt...yeah so I didn't know anything about the film before I bought it. So, what I think is that the effects were OK but I really didn't like the acting. I would describe Channing Tatum as ""wooden"" in the movie and I am not a big fan of Sienna Miller's acting. I saw no chemistry between the main characters! Their chemistry is supposed to be a very important and memorable part in the movie and it wasn't! I wasn't a big fan of the plot line either...but I dunno... I have never read the comics so I don't know if the stories in the comics were like the story in the movie...And as for directing, I think that Stephen Sommers has done better directing in movies such as The Mummy and Van Helsing but this movie didn't really stand out for me....So overall, the movie is alright. It isn't the best movie I have ever seen but it is not the worst. One of the only good things about this movie was Joseph Gordon-Levitt's acting. Seriously! He is an amazing actor! I think people should actually notice how good of an actor he really is..... :)",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
397,coygraham-58-724685,Worst Movie ever made,1,26 June 2011,"I would like to begin by asking the people who made this movie: what did all the G.i. Joe fans do to you to make you want to slap us in the face? This movie is one of the WORST movies I have ever had the misfortune to see. All the actors in this pile of junk were bad( except for the guys who played ""Snake-Eyes"" and ""Storm Shadow"". I though they did an okay job.) And the special effects were not all that great.The story was non-sense and the liberties they took with some of the characters was just insulting. I mean, Cobra Commander and the Baroness Brother and sister? What were they on when they though that up? Speaking of special effects, the robot suits,or what ever they were supposed to be, that ware near the beginning of the movie was stupid looking and was not needed.These are G.I Joes we are talking about, they don't need no stupid looking suit to kick cobra tail. I rated this movie a 1 only because I could not go any lower. If you have any love for G.I Joe you will not watch this movie, don't even look at it when you go bye it in a store. Just pretend that it was never made.On a final note, they need to dump this movie in the same hole they put the Atari 2600 E.T game in, but even that is too good for this movie.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
398,ttfreckleton,"Acton movie with plenty of action, but that's about it.",6,5 August 2009,"I saw G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra at a preview screening a day before it hit cinemas in Australia (6 August). I wasn't originally planning on seeing it as a paying customer and I'm glad it didn't in the end (pay that is). Even if I had waited for it on DVD I probably still would've felt like I wasted my time.G.I. Joe isn't exactly a terrible and bad film it's just that there's quite a lot of quality films out (a coming out) at the moment that seeing this would be a waste of a cinema outing. Not that everyone would feel that way, for example kids under 15 years (boys that is) would most likely enjoy it. It has rolling action throughout with cool gadgets (the kind that could only appear in the film set in the future), various locations visited around the World and a wide-range of different characters - friend and foe.These elements are also the film's undoing. The action is heavily GCI-based (probably an understatement) which is no surprise coming from Stephen Sommers, the director of The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and Van Helsing. It's almost like Sommers doesn't want to do what the great modern directors of this era like to do, that is get their hands dirty and film action scenes right in the thick of it. The action sequence in Paris is the best example of this. The G.I. Joe's are thundering through the streets in advance accelerator suits and a motorcycle which are both entirely composed by computer wizes in post-production. You feel supremely cheated in this sequence involving the Eiffel Tower as the trailer for the film gives the whole result away. The gadgets are almost too advanced, making them unbelievable and their are far too many characters to handle.The story is pretty generic. Soldiers Duke (Tatum) and Ripcord (Wayans) find themselves working with the elite G.I. Joe multi-national special ops team. Causing mayhem through his MARS Industries mega-company is Scottish arms dealer McCullen (Eccleston), his henchwomen The Baroness (Miller) and henchman ninja Storm Shadow (Lee) and the mysterious genius Doctor (Gordon-Levitt). The Doctor has created nanomites (which form as a green mist) which can basically do anything, but mainly form a deadly weapon that can destroy anything until switched off. In a nutshell is up to G.I. Joe to stop McCullen and the Doctor. The end battle is quite entertaining but is let down but the multiple story lines happening within it. The sword/ninja battles between Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes (Park) are actually very well down throughout. Most of the acting, primarily from Tatum, is awful. Quaid as General Hawk doesn't get much to work with nor does Eccleston. Tatum lacks chemistry with the other actors and all-round emotion - it's like he's in a soap opera. Gordon-Levitt's portrayal of the Doctor comes right from a 80's cartoon and I don't understand why some critics are praising it.Altogetehr I'd say that most would agree with me, once seen, that this film is best leaved for rental.",G.I.

399,jon_a_ross,A close following of the TV show at least in spirit. But they could have made it more.,4,9 August 2009,"Now I admit to those that say what else were you expecting that they have a solid point. I went to the GI Joe movie thinking that I would see a movie that only a seven year old boy would love. They were able to make that movie too.And I have to say that means they were at least true to the cartoon. Death occurs to minor characters off frame, our heroes and their foes are more often blasted across the screen by an explosion then shot and wounded. Minor scratches are the most serious injury shown by a character still moving with minimal blood loss.There are a bunch of chases, a bunch of explosions and some action scenes. If that's all I wanted then the dozen or so one liners that I laughed at would be a bonus.What disappointed me is how the rest of the movie falls apart. The directing is in the current style of 2 second cuts, limiting any possible character acting at all. In a couple of the longer dialog moments the back and forth between characters can make you sea sick. They loved their CGI models far more then they were worth, giving them a seven second 720 degree turn around for most of them. Which is more individual screen time then some of the actors get.I was also offended by the sexism shown in the movie. We have three female characters, two on the Joe side and one Cobra. Cover Girl, Scarlett and the Baroness. Two of these characters cry, moan, and act all emotional and unstable. It is how a young boy would see the female characters but still I would expect more.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
400,alvaradogustavo,A Real American Bad Movie,3,29 December 2010,"Plastic and pointless. Could it be any different? This is exactly the kind of boredom you have to expect from a movie based... on a toy line.G.I. Joe – The Rise of Cobra tells us a story (I guess) of a counter terrorist organization that can't manage to prevent a terrorist organization to destroy the Eiffel Tower as a sample of how united statian society (or a ancestrally resented scotchman) despises France... that's all I could get before I stop thinking in order to try and enjoy mediocrity, which I couldn't.One possibility is that the shooting, blasting, explosiveness and silliness were so massive that I miss the plot, which can only leads me to the action. There is a flood of those scenes, many of them unjustified, all of them mediocre. The acting was anything but bearable and Dennis Quaid couldn't even believe himself. This is where I stop and begin to ask to myself: why the hell did I watched and then reviewed a movie I knew, even before I learned they were going to make it, was going to be a plot less silly-kiddie/teenage flick? Damn, because it's my moral duty to denounce this cultural crime, and because I can exercise my writing with something so easy to stomp.A positive comment about the Joes?  Well, Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols look damn hot, but only a menage a trois with the aforementioned girls would give a little degree of decency to this fraud – only watchable if you're in the mood for a really bad movie filled with ridiculous outfit and poor designs.G.I.

Did anyone see the Dungeons and Dragons film he was in. OK, everyone is allowed to make at least 1 mistake, but his whole career has been a mistake. Riding off the coat tails of his brother.

403,ch1pm0nkz,After seeing this movie I believe I now have PTSD,1,17 August 2009,"I went into this ""movie"" with low, low expectations. From the trailers alone I could tell this ""movie"" was engineered for the mindless drones that make up the majority of summer blockbuster audiences. I imagine the only people will actually enjoy this ""film"" are the types of zombie slugs that clap and yell ""BIG BOOM! SEXY LADIES!"" when they see this. This movie request little, if any thinking at all to enjoy. I got far, far less out of going to see this than the faintest glimmer of hope that this would be even half-way decent, let alone watchable. It is seriously hard to describe with words how terrible this ""movie"" is. I am not in any way a fan boy or a fantasized G.I. Joe fan, nor am I comparing this to the source material (which I have seen some of). I am reviewing this movie solely for what it is: A disgraceful atrocity against mankind.For starters, the script was atrocious, to say the least. It seemed like every other word is a G.I. Joe catch phrase, or a cheese ball line. Delivered with sub-par acting, you can completely toss any hope for this aspect of the ""movie"" out the window and watch is collide on hard pavement 10 stories below.I know this time line is supposed to be independent from the G.I. Joe cartoon, but the story was pitiful as well. I think the biggest killer for me was the flashbacks that occurred every five to ten minutes. I understand these are placed in for the movie-goer who has no knowledge of characters, but they are all ridiculous and add absolutely nothing to the story. If they are going to do a sequel (which is set up at the end), they could have added in some of the character development then instead of cramming all of it in at once.The special effects weren't too bad, and some of the fighting was choreographed well. Rachel Nichols and Sienna Miller (leather suit) were nice eye candy as well, but those are the only good things I have to say about this ""movie"".If you are a mindless, unintelligent zombie that likes big explosions, nonsensical stories, and/or sexy ladies, strap on your bib (because your mouth will most likely be agape in amazement from flashing colors and lights during the ""film"") and watch this. Then when you are done come back to IMDb and give it anything above a 2 or 3.If you are even a half-way intelligent person that can understand basic laws of physics, and can appreciate even a decent summer blockbuster, do not watch this ""movie"". When I say do not watch this movie, I mean do not even bother illegally downloading it, or renting it. If a friend of yours has it and offers to watch it, leave immediately. If you walk into their place while they are half way through it, turn around and drive away quickly, or better yet, jump out the window.I saw this in a free theater and I felt so nauseous afterward, I think they should have paid me to watch it. If only I had known just how terrible this was going to be before going in, I would have saved myself the horror and agony of sitting through this, and watched paint dry, or stared directly at the sun (which would have been more entertaining).For those of you who can successfully read through this review without being distracted by a flying insect, do not under any circumstance watch this movie. If I could, I would rate this movie as a Class A Poison. Keep it away from children and animals, because even a small dose is potentially harmful. Yes, that is right: I would not let even my dog watch this, as I would consider it animal cruelty. This is a fair warning to you all!To IMDb: Please make the rating system 0-10, so I can give this movie a 0.Note: I put the words film and movie in quotations when referring to G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra. This is because I do not actually believe this to be a movie, but instead an anthology of how stupid the human race has become in mass.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Not dead. Not unconscious. Not paralyzed. Not missing limbs or with broken bones. Just slightly dizzy and cognizant enough to crack wise, ""next time, I'll drive"".

407,Filmicafe,it delivers the goods with shameless entertainment.,7,8 August 2009,"THE SUMMER blockbuster season goes out with a bang in the action-packed adrenaline ride G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.Director Stephen Sommers, whose previous films include The Mummy, The Mummy Returns and Van Helsing, piles on the pyrotechnics in a full-on assault of action and visual effects.G.I. Joe is an American line of military action figures marketed in the UK as Action Man and Action Force. The toys were also adapted into comics and cartoons, with Sommers saying he drew mainly on the comic books for the film's story.Paramount Pictures and toymakers Hasbro are hoping for another big-screen franchise after previously collaborating to turn Transformers into a monster hit at the box office.For those unfamiliar with the G.I. Joe brand, imagine putting Top Gun, The A-Team, Thunderbirds, the earlier Bond movies and the X-Men into a blender with a hefty dose of steroids, and this is what might result.You get super-weapons, secret lairs, dastardly villains, gadgets galore and an abundance of explosive action sequences as Sommers empties his toy box and throws it all on screen with brisk and breathless editing.But it's not just about boys and their toys – there are also girls with guns and gizmos too. It's a thrill ride of escapist popcorn fun – lads, their dads and those who are still kids at heart will love it. Girls will coo over the square-jawed hunkiness of Channing Tatum and wish they had the killer curves of Sienna Miller and Rachel Nichols, who strut about in skintight leather and end up rolling on the floor in a vicious catfight.It begins with a prologue establishing the heritage of unscrupulous arms dealer McCullen (Christopher Eccleston), who has invented nanomites – swarms of microscopic machines capable of destroying anything in their path.Special forces operatives Duke (Tatum) and Ripcord (Marlon Wayans) are hired by McCullen to deliver warheads bristling with his new technology. The convoy is attacked by the Baroness (Miller) and her cohorts who aim to steal the payload for a terror group led by Destro and the Cobra Commander.Into the fray steps G.I. Joe, the US Government's top-secret military defence division, who include Dennis Quaid as leader General Hawk, Rachel Nichols as Scarlett, Ray Park as gimp-masked silent swordsman Snake Eyes and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Mr Eko from Lost) as Heavy Duty.Duke and Ripcord are recruited into the team and, with the help of advanced skills and technology, the good guys leap into action to stop the terrorists. The battle for the warheads takes us to the Sahara, the polar ice-caps and also to Paris, where there is a long, stunt-packed chase sequence and an onslaught of destruction. Without spoiling it all, let's just say Paris is changed forever.Amid all the carnage, flashbacks help to lift the story beyond superficial spectacle, fleshing out the back-stories of some characters in assorted subplots of romance, revenge and rivalry.The key performers deliver, including all-American stud-u-like Tatum; Miller as a gun-toting, raven-haired vixen; Wayans and his flippant wit; and Nichols as the action babe for the good guys.In contrast, the more heavyweight performers such as Eccleston, Quaid and Gordon-Levitt seem constrained by the limits of the material, in particular Eccleston (with dubious Scottish accent) who is lost in the mix and lacks a potent presence.Although the film is less cheesy than The Mummy and far better than the monster mish-mash that was Van Helsing, this is pure pulp adventure.The dialogue is either hammy or inconsequential while attempts at humour are mostly forgettable. The initial set-up for the story whizzes past too quickly to take it all in and the action is relentless – some will find it excessive even for an action movie.But the world is in peril and we're whisked along for the roller-coaster ride. The sheer absurdity of it all is smothered in computer-generated effects and delivered at a pace that doesn't allow you to question it too much. Which would spoil the fun completely.For a film based on a toy, a cartoon and a comic, it delivers the goods with shameless entertainment.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

410,knomadd,"Well, Thanks for S#!++ing on a Rich Story History!",2,8 August 2009,"I am going to start by saying I am an old G.I Joe fan. However, I should tell that I came to G.I. Joe differently than most. For me, it started with the original comic book series. The things that made this series great from the beginning strong character development, entertaining stories, snappy dialog. My interest in the toys then became great, but only because I thought the characters in the comics were so cool.The cartoon was very different than the comics. However, despite the varying differences between the comic series, toys, and cartoon series, all had a certain ability to co-exist with a seemingly mutual (albeit at times perhaps begrudging) respect for each other. Right & wrong, duty & honor, hard work & sacrifice were the lessons to be taken from G.I. Joe, in all of its forms in those days.All of these are major components that are missing from G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra.Nearly all of the things that had made the various characters so likable in the previous forms mentioned are, quite simply, gone. There are not even exaggerated caricatures of their former representations. They are simply and completely reworked in such a way that a character of the same name would be unidentifiable when compared. All this character alteration seems to be to move a story that is equally banal.To say this thing was like a bad James Bond film (think later Brosnan here) without the charisma, intrigue, or ability to care what the hell happens to anyone on screen, falls short. That statement would still not convey sufficiently the done to death, 1-dimensional character archetypes, overused (as well as at times poorly rendered) visual effects, and extremely cliché story points I have now had the misfortune to subject myself to.Because nearly every element of this movie has been done ad nauseam, I was unable to find it even entertaining while doing my very best to put aside my beloved childhood characters.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
411,trancer96,Unbelievably bad,3,25 September 2012,Normally I don't have an issue with action movies being a bit low-brow but this was bad. Really bad. The thing that grinds the most is that actors like Christopher Eccleston and Joseph Gordon-Levitt can be really good and yet their acting was as bad as everyone else in this movie. That basically points to poor script and poor directing. Even as a visual movie it was terrible with the physics of most of the CGI making it look about as realistic as a roadrunner cartoon. Considering this is basically an expensive non-stop action movie shouldn't some effort have gone into getting that right at least? Avengers was basically that formula too but it was a substantially better movie in every way.,G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
412,longshot21771,GiJoe..... Gee I wasted my time!!!!!,1,16 August 2009,"This was one of the worst movies on my list. Yes it was more toward kids ( at least it seemed like it ) except for the occasional foul language. Marlon Wayans tries to be comic relief but comes up short..real short. Overall this movie is a huge waste of time seeing. I feel asleep a couple of times and almost walked out, but had nothing better to do so stuck it out. Trust me don't waste you money on this movie unless one of your kids drives you nuts wanting to see this goto the matinée showing. The action is minimal and the acting is horrible. What was Dennis Quaid thinking of getting involved with this move? Must have needed a paycheck. Sienna Miller is the eye candy of the movie and that is about it, frequently they focus on her perfect cleavage to try to keep you somewhat interested. Channing Tatum what an overrated actor, reminds me of eminem. (**SPOILER**) Destro was so generic looking and the characters were so much like the mighty morphin power rangers just awful!!",G.I.

413,stevott,You have to be kidding,1,3 December 2010,"If I could give this movie a zero I would. To be honest I knew from seeing the trailer that this movie would be terrible, which is why I watched it. I love watching crappy movies with my friends and getting a good laugh. Sometimes, we come across a movie which is so terrible it isn't even fun to make fun of. This is one of those movies. I would like to make comparisons to other terrible movies, but I can't even think of any at the moment. I'm not sure if the acting or screenplay was worse, but the amazing Halo SPARTAN suits definitely take the cake. Honestly, as a warning to people who crave crappy movies like I do, this one isn't worth it. The only movie I can compare it to is The Last Airbender, which is in a league of its own.If we needed more Darth Vaders we would have asked. I just do not understand who looks at a script like that and says ""Yes lets do that""",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
414,schock-4,Very entertaining but no depth if you're not a fan,6,17 August 2009,"I don't feel like I want my 2 hours back, but the only thought anyone could give to the film after those two entertaining hours would be to compare it to the cartoons/comics. To that end, my opinions are thus:They did a great job with casting, although Dennis Quaid should not try to fake a John Wayne accent. : D Ray Park, playing the role of Snake Eyes, once again kicks ash. His scenes alone are almost worth the price of admission. Byung-hun Lee also does a great job as Storm Shadow and I'm happy to say they seem to have preserved most if not all of the back story for these two characters.The characterizations were very good, including the changes to some of the characters' back stories. Not over the top and also not two-dimensional. And no, Marlon Wayans, including his predictable brand of comedy relief, did not have a major influence on the tone of the film. My only complaint is that the back story for this incarnation of Cobra Commander is really dull compared to some of the cartoon/comic concepts. I had hoped for a larger ensemble of Joes, in keeping in line with the franchise, but my guess is that future G.I. Joe movies will expand on that. On the other hand, they brought in more Cobra classics than I expected.The ""accelerator suits"" which are featured in the trailers are, I think, unnecessary and not in keeping with the franchise. My biggest complaint here is, why aren't the other Joes wearing them and why hasn't Cobra (not called Cobra in the movie) stolen/adopted them yet. I know the reason they were used, they're major eye candy, but they could have done more with less. I predict they'll come up with some cheesy excuse to scrap them for the next movie while letting the bad guys use something nearly identical.Seriously, it's not bad. Good matinée movie, not quite full price. Way better than G-force. My 9-year-old agrees, we expected that one to be much better.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
415,TrojanDan98,Weak Link - Sienna Miller,6,3 November 2009,"As a popcorn action flick, this movie is no worse than the Transformer movies. In fact, I think it is a bit better. Lots of action and explosions, not so great acting, nonsensical plot - all that you'd expect from a Hollywood blockbuster. The special effects weren't half- bad. I found it to be quite entertaining.The weak link in the movie is the Baroness character. The chances that Gordon-Levitt and Sienna Miller are related? I say zero. Her mannerisms, her acting look like she's better suited to be on a runway or out on rodeo drive, not the evil (yet sexy) villain she's supposed to be. Scarlett was much better. She was far more convincing as an action hero.The Paris scene was a bit outlandish and a bit weak. The suits looked really awkward. They looked like how cgi dwarfs would run.Lastly, I loved the Brendan Fraser cameo.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
416,VelHam6,"Go, Joe!",9,12 August 2009,"To address the naysayers...I was more of a Barbie girl than a G.I. Joe aficionado in my youth so I don't know or care if this movie was true to any original or not. My kids and husband wanted to see this so I conceded...and I'm sooo glad I did. The plot and script were expectedly predictable but well done, I enjoyed the intermittent comedic one-liners, the action was appropriately intense and not too bloody, the martial arts fights were exciting, and I loved the special effects and all the high-tech toys and gadgets. I so gotta get myself a set of those invisible camouflage BDUs that ""Scarlett"" wore and the suit that ""Duke"" and ""Ripcord"" donned to run thru the streets of Paris. My fat days and morning commutes would never be the same!The good guys and bad guys were all strong, formidable and easy on the eyes (except for the ones who weren't supposed to be!) and they all delivered their fair share of gratuitous cans of whoop-arse. Oddly, I had done no research before seeing this movie and didn't even know who the stars were gonna be. I was therefore very pleased to see a few of my favorites like Dennis Quaid, Marlon Wayans, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Arnold Vosloo and an apparently uncredited Brendan Fraser. Bonus props, too, for the Black Eyed Peas' ""Boom Boom Pow"" playing during the closing credits - excellent choice.So why a 9 and not a 10? Two very minor things...although Channing Tatum is super-hot (meow!), my opinion is that his acting was a tad awkward and he didn't seem to fit with the rest of the cast. Sorry, Mr. Tatum. And I was oddly preoccupied by this weird urge to fix Sienna Miller's very obvious wig because it didn't seem to be positioned correctly. I became distracted by an imagined fear that her long, dark, faux locks would shift or slide off her head completely. Incidentally, she managed to keep her tresses in place without my help. Despite my mane anxiety, though, Ms. Miller rocked as an against-her-will femme fatale. Besides, my hubby and sons assured me that her hair was not what they were focusing on anyway.So if you like action pics with lots of pretty people and the good guys winning in the end (or did they?), this movie will not disappoint.

The story wasn't too complex and relatively easy to follow which should suit anyone wanting a break from films that are trying to be too clever for their own good. We need more films like this that are just fun and packed with great intense action - but done well. Yes the FX weren't up to Transformers 2 standard - but regardless I enjoyed this a little more than Transformers 2 - it felt fresh and inspiring and it did what a good film is supposed to do - it transported me away from day to day life to another world!",G.I.

418,alan_mann,this has to be one of the worst films I have ever watched,1,6 August 2009,"it was far far too long, the only good part was in Paris when they wore the suits (basically from the TV trailers), an unusually silly film that I would honestly recommend anyone to wait until it appears on DVD or better to save your money and await T.V. in 3 years. I'm trying to put into words how bad this film was and it's difficult... . honestly... . I was just hoping it would end very soon and throughout thought more about writing a comment on IMDb during the presentation as opposed to trying my hardest to enjoy it, if you had to live your life in Hell, this film would only have to do a Groundhog Day and you will then know what true torture is. Sienna Miller is useless, Christopher Eccleston from Salford gives the worst Scottish accent ever (I think he must have watched Braveheart many times over and asked Mr Gibson for some help). Dennis Quaid is... . terrible! it must be the worst part he's ever played, by the looks of things on this film he came right out the back end of Martin Short and planted himself in this massive black hole of an enigma. the only thing that got me at the end was Snake Eyes did not speak, wow that totally shook me up!",G.I.

419,twentymooseman,crap sandwich is just one of many terms i could use to describe this movie,1,13 August 2009,"I don't often use the phrase ""crap sandwich"", but i feel it accurately describes the G.I. Joe movie. While i didn't really go in expecting much, but it somehow dropped below my expectations. First off I will say that the plot had some potential, not that it could have been great but it could have been OK. But really the plot felt like it was just there to give a reason for the special effects to be there. Now the special effects were great, but you cant build a movie purely on special effects. it's like filling a cup with icing and calling it a cupcake. by the way, if the razzies did a worst movie with best special effects award, this would definitely win. the action could have been choreographed much better because it feels like watching the old power ranger show from the 90s. the costume design and other design elements felt like they looked at the most successful video games of the past couple years and said ""hey that looks cool, let's throw it in."" examples would be the suits seem like they ripped off crysis, the enemy soldiers look like they were taken from the main characters of army of two, and i could waste more space on saying what else they ripped off but i still have to ridicule the rest of this. Honestly I'm not trying to say they actually did that, but the similarities were a bit to noticeable to overlook. My other problem is that they didn't really stay loyal to the source material, to any degree. I'm not even a die hard G.I. Joe fan and this was pretty apparent to me. Really they just had the same characters and decided to throw out everything else out. Throwing in the old catch phrases doesn't cut it. I was also disappointed at the lack of red lasers and blue lasers. The acting was stiff as a board and the parts that were supposed to be dramatic just kinda made me laugh, which i'm not sure i've ever giggled at a funeral scene that wasn't meant to be funny but the one in this movie is possibly the most cliché one you'll ever see. the wrong actors were chosen for the characters they played, but if you put a few in different parts they might have been fine. throw in some badly placed but funny catch phrases from the cartoon in such as ""knowing is half the battle"" and there is the crap sandwich called GI joe. all in all this is just a long toy commercial that i would have been better off never seeing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
420,fadz_scorpio14,Precisely Complete for My Anticipation Summer's Blockbuster Movie!!,10,8 August 2009,"I absolutely love this film!!!! Its so good ,lively and BIG BUDGET film!!!! Lots of action, comedy, and drama!!The effort for the acting is well too. Channing, Sienna and Rachel delivering their character for Duke, Baroness and Scarlett in well!! They really good!! I Love THEM SO MUCH!(well, especially Rachel Nicols)!!!! The desperadoes for this movie also good because they force me to kill them due to their behavior!! i will always hate Storm Shadow especially because he so irritating and vicious (love Snake Eyes)!!The actions is brilliant too. Great effects, (but too ridiculous!!) and sounds (so loud). My Favorite scene is when all of them at Paris!! Its so Tantalizing and Tempting!! but no comment for scripts.This film also has a comedy moments whereas Marlon Wayans delivers the comedy moments (he always in that!!)Lastly, for those who doubt to watch this movie i suggest u to go now and watch it because it worth every seconds and you will love it!!!! I will watch it again and again until the most anticipating movie District 9 coming out!!p.s : get off ROTF and HBP!! because JOEs are coming!!sorry for my bad English ;)",G.I.

421,osmo-suominen-1,A HUGE disappointment,3,12 September 2010,"First of all, I'm a big G. I. Joe fan (and I mean the comics). I have all the comics released in Finland, and they are a big part of my childhood. And this is perhaps the biggest reason why I was so disappointed.All out action, okay. Nice explosions and special effects, well, not actually, the special effects seemed from time to time be from a movie made in the early 2000! The underwater sequence and chase scene in Paris were nice, though (and I gave a star for bringing the Eiffel tower down). Then, the plot and the characters...The characters were pretty much hit and miss. Channing Tatum shouldn't have been let anywhere near the character of Duke. It has been a while since I've seen such a black hole of charisma. Ray Park was okay as Snake Eyes, but the character was used way too little. And the ""romance"" subplots: BULLSHIT!!! And the less I go into the characters like Cobra Commander and the Baroness, the better. The plot was okay, although there was WAY TOO MUCH high-technology bullshit (in the comics they went that way with space marines in the end, and that was one of the moments people saw G. I. Joe was going down soon). And half of the movie was spent laying grounds for a sequel...If this was a normal action film, it would have been ""meeh, 'twas okay"". But as a G. I. Joe... If you want to see a well made G. I. Joe movie, see for example G. I. Joe: Resolute.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
422,nicholasjette,Complete success,6,27 October 2009,"For what this movie was meant to be it was complete success. I usually don't like these kinds of movies but I'm an enthusiastic fan of GI Joe from the 80s and I felt justice was served, GI Joe style. Of course if you don't like GI Joe and are expecting to be challenged then you're watching the wrong movie. This was tons of fun on a sick day off from work. Much of the cheesy silliness of the Transformers movie is avoided here which made all the difference to me. There aren't any useless scenes like the robot peeing on the guy in Transformers. It takes itself seriously enough and the actors and director/crew respect and understand the source material. Congratulations to Stephen Sommers, thanks for not ruining it and I'm looking forward to the next one.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
423,johnnysexkiller,A Real American Fan's take on this,2,7 August 2009,I saw this at midnight I still have my figures I still watch the cartoons. This movie was like the sci-fi channel doing a bad rip off of the cartoon. It's actually worse than you can possibly imagine if you are a die hard fan like me. Why Hollywood tries to re-write good stories and characters is beyond me. Zartan is the only one they got close to being right. With this being said it will be a cool movie for kids. No sex no language and little blood. As long as you have never seen Gi Joe or read the comics and you don't mind chessy forced dialogue and bad acting you will like this movie. And snake eyes looks like he is wearing the batman suit. Val Kilmer looked more like snake eyes in the saint when he was climbing that building in the beginning of the movie.,G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
424,pori06,Tune it on and enjoy the ride.,7,13 December 2009,"If you are a serious looking punch, looking for good acting or direction this is not the movie for you.But if you are looking for action, martial art, Sci-Fi-gadgets and tremendous animation work, this is it.In my opinion this is far better than 'Star Trek' or 'Star Wars', only 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' or 'X-men'(All 3 parts)are comparable. The vehicles like cars, bikes, aeroplanes, submarines etc are superbly designed and the stunts of the actors are mind blowing. The story line is pretty good. and I guess their will be a part II soon (may be more, hope I am right). Don't put on your thinking caps, just let your mind flow with the movie and eventually you will like it. I love to watch all kinds of movies including this one. So just fasten your seat belts and enjoy. I give this 7.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
425,kangeugene,This Film Sucks,1,2 February 2010,"Wow, what a terrible movie. The only reason I went to see this film was because I enjoyed the cartoons. I was extremely disappointed. G. I. Joe just shows that big budgets can't always produce a good movie. If you would, I would briefly like to summarize this film: lame jokes, corny and awkward scenes, horrible cast, and not-so-great CGI effects. Absolutely ridiculous. I wanted to leave during the movie, but the fact that I paid seven dollars forced me to stay back. I would seriously recommend not watching this film. It's a waste of money, and a waste of time if you prefer to download. On the bright side, this film probably made a new record: the worst movie of the decade.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
426,Rooney101,Rips Off So Many Other Titles.,3,12 August 2009,"This movie lacks any originality. It seems like every aspect of the film has been taken from another film. Lets start by looking at the end of G.I. Joe. The end of the film can be almost exactly compared to Star Wars. Lets say Darth Vader = Ana, Luke Skywalker = Duke, The Emperor = Rex and 'Enemy Base' = Death StarAna saves Duke from Rex. Duke then has to carry Ana out because Ana is too injured from overthrowing Rex. At this time the 'enemy base' is being destroyed. Duke carries Ana to a ship and they fly out. At the point when Ana and Duke enter the ship, it changes into the Millennium Falcons escape from the Death Star having just flown in and destroyed it. The fly out fleeing and shooting at enemy ships. Ana and Duke then fly out through a final small tunnel as ships behind them become engulfed in flames etc etc etc.Other similarities include Snake Eyes and Storm Shadows final battle. It was just like watching Obi Wan and Darth Maul at the end of the Phantom Menace just with ninja swords instead of light-sabers.The Accelerator Suits also remind me far too much of Iron ManThis film also includes a tremendous amount of stupidity. Such as 1 man being able to fly a one of a kind plane that he has never seen before, or that to be able to shoot a missile in this plane the pilot has to say some ridiculous Celtic word instead of just 'Shoot' or 'Fire' The enemy base gets destroyed because the Ice on the surface gets blown into pieces and sinks down. This is completely ridiculous because ice floats. It doesn't matter if it's broken up or not, it just doesn't sink, try it. One last ridiculous scene includes where Rex seems to be killed. He runs into a building, seconds later an air strike turns it into ruins which you can clearly see. Yet later on when it shows Rex inside the building, some other scientist just shuts a door and they both miraculously survive. I could also go into detail about how much it also rips off Team America though i really can't be bothered. There is just no originality to the film and every scene just seems to be been stolen from some other film.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
427,rlk493,Made Me a Die Hard Fan for G.I Joe / Snake Eyes In Just 118 Minutes,10,15 August 2009,"I saw this movie a few days ago with my family and I was worried that it would one of those movies that looked amazing from the commercials with tons of action, fighting, and explosions, then come to find when I finally went to see it it is the worst acting with little to no action and then finding out that all the good parts of the movie were shown in the commercial...like Street Fighter the movie. However THIS WAS NOT THE CASE with G.I. Joe Rise of Cobra. I went to this movie kind of nervous that it would turn out like I just described but from the moment that it started to the second that it finished I had my eyes glued to the screen and wanting more when it was finished. I know that some people may have mixed reviews, finding EVERYTHING wrong with a great movie, mainly those people who have followed the series from the beginning and are die hard fans. I was not one of those people who really followed the series when the comic books came put, in fact I knew about G.I. Joe but never really learned more about it. Now I am kicking myself for not getting involved in the series, both comic book and TV series from the very beginning, this is what the movie as done to me, made me a die hard fan of G.I Joe like many other people.However what I really want to talk about is the movie and how absolutely amazing it was. It was a great action movie from beginning to end with nonstop action and explosions throughout. One of the main reasons that I loved the movie so much, other then the immense action and overall amazing atmosphere was one character that I could have watched for days and not even been the slightest bit bored.........SNAKE EYES!!!! I know that Snake Eyes is most peoples favorite character and for great reason, he is definitely the coolest person ever, I wish I could be him when I grow up :-). I am not going to go on and on talking about how much I loved Snake Eyes and how great the action, plot and characters were I am just going to finish up by saying PLEASE see this movie, as you can obviously tell I loved it and I know that you will too. Unless you are one of those nit-picky people who love to complain about everything you will love this movie, but if you are just going to go see it to complain and find faults with it if it is not exactly like the series then don't see it because no one especially me wants to hear you complain about it, the movie doesn't deserve that kind of rep when it deserves so much more.",G.I.

429,psychojiggly,Low expectations satisfied,2,13 January 2010,"*May contain spoilers* Let me start off by saying I did not like this movie. I watched it from beginning to end and am still trying to recover brain cells. As I watched GI Joe: Rise of Cobra there were several pieces that stuck out. Now, the acting was terrible, the direction could have been better, the SFX were not that good. Some of the parts made no sense and the order the movie was put in with flashbacks here and there was a bit confusing. They could have started off with the back story instead of jumping in at various places with the flashbacks which seemed completely out of place. I didn't like their inserting romance into the movie as that too seemed out of place. The affair between Duchess and Duke seemed force as the chemistry between the two simply wasn't there. The connection between Ripcord and the redhead, that seemed a bit forced, too. To be perfectly honest the entire movie seemed forced, the actors didn't seem like they wanted to be there at all. I would recommend (?) renting this movie to determine for yourself how you feel, but do not waste money buying it until you have watched it.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Hoe 2!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope that Roy doesn't ruin that one, too.I love the Wayans brothers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I give it 10 Wayans brothers out of ten.P.S.This movie needs less Roy and more Wayans Brovas.",G.I.

431,insaneroj,gi joke,1,1 December 2009,this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever had to watch. it is just terrible. horrible. i can't warn you to stay away from this piece of crap. even my little cousin who is the reason i went to see this wanted to leave.i'm left trying to think up stuff to say about a movie that is so bad it made my eyes bleed. The idea that people in Hollywood think that movies about kids toys should be made is sad. I've seen a couple of these movies but this one was the worst.let me recap this is so bad that words can't tell you how bad it was. there is no story. even if there was would you want to watch one about plastic toy soldiers?,G.I.

432,mark-4834,Good Movie,10,16 August 2009,"G I Joe was exactly what I was expecting; it is a great adaptation from cartoon to movie. There is plenty of action, a rather good story line and great effects. If you were expecting a realistic movie, then you are wasting your time even thinking of going to watch GI JOE. People from my generation grew up with GI JOE; we had the toys, the T shirts, the whole works. It does not make sense that people say this was mindless action, poor story, blah blah blah. If you were expecting an Oscar winner, then sorry buddy you must stop using that crack pipe. Sorry this is no saving private Ryan. This was by far a better adaptation from cartoon to movie than Transformers was, period. The humor was subtle and did not have that ""try to be funny feel"" about it. The effects were great and not over the top like some adaptations. My honest opinion great movie if you enjoyed GI JOE or like a good action movie, if not please do not waste time complaining about it.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
433,brettlutchman,GI Joe was Fantastic,9,16 August 2009,"I told everyone not to watch this movie because the commercials were so cheezy and lame. After watching it, I was very impressed. Everything was covered including: 1. How Destro gets his steel head 2. How Cobra Commander comes to power 3. How Cobra Commander keeps Destro under control 4. The Baroness was dead on 5. Snake Eyes- dead on 6. Storm Shadow- dead on 7. Scarlett's weapons 8. The animosity between Snake Eyes & Storm Shadow 9. Why S.E. doesn't talk 10 Quotes on ""Kung Fu Grip"", ""Yo Joe"", and ""Knowing is half the Battle"" 11. Old Double Bubble excerpt from the 80's commercials ""But it's my last piece"" 12. Various modes of Transportations 13. Duke being a hotshotThe story line was well thought out and every event is justified with various scenes in the movie.Believe me, I tear movies apart all the time, but this was not only accurate, but it was very entertaining. A family can watch this.This is a good example of how retro movies should be...unlike Transformers. Too bad Transformers had to have people in thee movie instead of just having the Autobots and Deceptacons rip each other apart.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
434,pisop0,Hasbro was in the credits - need i say more,1,17 August 2009,"Had low expectations when I was invited to see this movie, but the experience was worse than I expected. From the beginning, the story reminded me of several formulaic plots in dozens of comic books. Come to think of it, some of those story lines were prob GI Joe comics. At the end, it was hard not to laugh at the absurd situations that miraculously seemed to resolve themselves. Instead, I laughed my head off upon leaving the theatre. Now I like good action movies, but I think this one was too predictable. I had figured out the identity of the Cobra leader about halfway through the show. After that it was hard not to predict what would happen in the chase scenes, the big underwater battle, the minor damage to the bad guy's escape that prevents him from succeeding, blah, blah blah... If you're an adult, I hope you seriously think about spending your money on something with more depth. I don't have kids, but the ones in the theatre didn't seem to be enjoying themselves much.",G.I.

435,tradme11,You don't ask to be part of G.I. Joe. You get asked!,9,16 October 2009,"I was very exciting and about to go to the cinema for this movie after I saw the trailer, but after I saw the rating and some comments here, I decided not to waste my money on this one, instead I downloaded and watched this movie on 19"" widescreen LCD, and now I REGRET! Now these days, it's really difficult to enjoy an action movie shows as good as the trailer presented, or even better! I can't remember when was the last time after I watched the action movie and my heart was screaming ""WOW It's great one actually, and I want more!"" (maybe after X2) I think G.I. Joe is definitely one of the few action movies shows better than the trailer itself, not only it's hard to find a boring bit, but almost every shots/actions have delivered the message, the stories behinde the characters. (wish I can say more, but I don't want to be a spoiler!) There's a reason why I decided to write my very own first comment here for G.I. Joe, if you like action movie, video game, high-tech warfare or martial art, you'll definitely love this one and worth to watch it in cinema at the ""first time"" (I know it's too late, but still...), please don't let the rating and some negative comments here to effect your decision ;-)",G.I.

436,zoolander27,CGI Joe!,6,27 November 2009,"This could have been a lot worse. Maybe it's because I had low expectations but as a popcorn movie(or at home,a good six-pack action movie it works pretty well.This is Stephen Sommers best film(which admittedly isn't saying much)and the main problem is that the movie is in one gear the whole time(third) and it eventually wears you down.It seldom stops to take a breath and this would have helped as even the flashback scenes zip by as little segments here and there. But as one other poster mentioned at least Sommers does not indulge in the shaky-cam histrionics that marred the Star Trek reboot.(I didn't see ROTF but I have seen some bad Michael Bay films) The action flows pretty well and I was surprised that there was any character background at all considering this movie's toy-based roots(and for the record I disliked the corny Mummy movies that were so revered when released but are now getting their due as silly films.)this is an action film for the young at heart and Robert Altman or Polanski fans would do well to look elsewhere. and the Baroness is by far my favorite character(for obvious reasons.That hot bad girl with glasses and leather look is irresistible) but she is also the most compelling character too so I may be biased.My biggest gripe is what happens with her at the end which I won't reveal here but to say i was disappointed would be an understatement. all in all an entertaining,fun movie(especially the Paris Chase scene) which loses a star because of the ADD aspect and the whole underwater battle thing at the end being pretty dreary and anticlimactic.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
437,BillStilson,G.I. Cliché,4,25 November 2009,"As a kid I was never really exposed to G.I. Joe but seeing the trailer got me interested. Much of this movie is cliché as the title implies. Good Vs. Evil, Nemesis'(the 2 ninja dudes), Guy saves girl, guy(s) get girl, bad guys get away swearing vengeance as their hideout destroys it self, and producers not doing proper research into military equipment. There is a heck of a lot more cliché than this but this is a start. The first 5 stereo types are self explanatory, but I just have to point out inaccuracies, I understand that G.I. Joe is fictional. 1. Apache helicopters are designed to attack ground infantry and armor, not flying vehicles. 2. The gun used as an assault rifle in the scene where the Pit is being attacked by Cobra is not an assault rifle but rather an AA-12 automatic shotgun. 3. The SMG gauntlets that Duke and Ripcord wear in the chase through Paris that fires 50 rounds per second would probable tear your arm off and give ya one hell of a burn. This is a typical action flick I've seen many other action flicks and doesn't even make an attempt at keeping the audience interested. It was so predictable it put spoilers out of business. If you like monotonous predictability, or if you really don't care this is a great movie with fantastic special effects and CGI. If you want to see a mold-breaking movie you are looking in the wrong place.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
438,courtneymcclure14,8/10,8,27 November 2009,"Contrary to what most people are saying, I actually thought this was a pretty good movie. My only thing was that now that I think about it, they didn't spend that much time on the power suit, which is a big part of the GI Joe storyline. Ray Park did a great job as the silent Snake Eyes. I actually think he was the best actor in the whole movie, and he didn't have to say a word. The drama of Rex was great, but I do regret that they didn't do too much with the ending. It was a good beginning to the franchise, and all in all I thought it was pretty cool. The things they could to with the power suits were pretty amazing, as was the appearance of Dennis Quaid.

Joe: Rise of the Cobra.It's like someone opened a can of cliché, distilled it into it's purest form, then drowned this movie in it. There's absolutely nothing you can't guess right off the goddamn bat.There's some beautiful women in tight clothing, biiiig explosions, some ninjas who've trained under a Chinese ninja master who gets shanked by a KID! Oh, and the occasional stupid, utterly boring drama parts, like ""Oh, the woman who's bad suddenly turns good and love conquers all"". And then there's the character who gets traumatized over one little fockin' collateral civilian death!Gimme a break!But it's not completely bad. At least the female antagonist looks beautiful with her dark hair. Other than that this movie is just a bunch of clichés piled on clichés topped with CGI. Brainless.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
440,cubice,good entertainment,7,23 October 2009,I don't know what people expected when they saw the title GI Joe but I guess all that can be expected was a good popcorn action movie which is what this movie delivers. Seriously who expects a master thriller plot or an epic movie style when they see GI Joe in the title. I watched this movie for what it is an entertaining action (I mean pure action ) movie and it delivers superbly lots of interesting looking but totally irrational cars and weapons and lots of Bang to go along with it. Yes the fined underwater assault is copied form star wars and the action in Paris seems like a scene from Team America but really this is GI Joe it is supposed to be like team America but with lots of action and it just delivers that thats why I think it deserves a 7,G.I.

Even the submarines looked like Rebellion Frigates and Battle Ships3)Hell the Doctor/Rex Should have just been called The Vader Emperor for gods sake. 4)The whole Becoming Destro is straight from Revenge of the SithSeriously this movie made me mad and i was surprised because i actually yelled f**k you at the screen. Luckily i was the only one in the theater, no surprise, and don't think i am a hater, but i felt cheated for my money, i mean i went in wanting to watch a popcorn action movie not a ripoff, and for me to get mad at the screen and actually say things like ""F**k this movie up its a**"" is not fun, it's not even fun to make fun of, i actually complained to the manager and said i wanted my money back. Didn't get it but i digress.Script had no originality, plot holes galore, and cardboard acting.Save your money and wait for the DVD or Blu-ray to hit the bargain bin.Seriously, you will be glad you did.P.S.

443,hysonmb,Good movie if you're not looking too deep,7,8 August 2009,"This movie was better than I expected which wasn't very much. As one of the many who grew up with the 80's G.I Joe toys, comics, and cartoons, I was almost certain that this movie would completely ruin my memories. Luckily, the reliance on a lot of action with few slow moments makes the movie a 2 hour comic brought to life.The only issues that I have are that I don't like some of the redone back stories of the characters and some of the events will have to have some far fetched explanations if they make a sequel. It almost seems that something has to be screwed up to make a movie from a franchise that already works (Spider-Man didn't have built in webbing, Doom had demons coming through a portal, etc etc). Also, I don't have a problem with the team being international, but, why not introduce new characters and make them members of the team instead of changing the ones that we remember? The costumes are alright, not amazing. I feel that the Snake-Eyes costume is overdone. His mask could have been made from any tactical mask on the market but they went with the big rubbery thing you see on the ads. The Storm Shadow outfit looks good and fits well with both the old story and the current. The Baroness looks more like the original character than any of the others. Gen. Hawk is a close second as far as the original looks go but that's about where it stops.If you're a G.I. Joe fan, you'll like the movie. It delivers on the action that was a major part of the franchise and does so well.

445,sylent_ny,You'll laugh,2,8 August 2009,"You will laugh at the screen, and roll your eyes, and groan, and find time for a potty break.My brain hurts.This flick is like Transformers 2 absent any reason or plot, it even uses some of the same sets(I wonder if Egypt gets paid every time a pyramid is shown on screen) The sets are nice, there is the elaborate super secret good guy lair and the super secret evil den(which sadly swallowed Superman's Fortress of Solitude and made it into an underwater Star Wars space station), but that is probably the best thing one can say about the movie. Even the action sequences weren't all that great.And the movie is one big two hour action sequence with impatient and tenuous oh-yeah-we-need-an-explanation paragraphs of plot shoved in here and there. The use of flashbacks is just laziness on the part of the scriptwriters to instill some sort of character to the characters. Plot holes, and there are many, are casually side-stepped by the film-makers to let the action last longer because that is the only reason why a guided cruise missile wasn't used to strike down the bad guy in (insert the location because there are so many) This can still be forgivable(?) were the action not cheap and computerized looking. Discounting the couple of ninja sword-fights and the one chase scene, there aren't a lot of engaging action sequences. Both batches of heroes/villains mow through clouds of screaming good/bad minions, but that's nothing new or thrilling. I didn't really like the chase scene that much simply because I didn't really like how the focus shifted to the suits instead of how much better Snake Eyes and the girl were doing without the suits. The whole concept of the super suit bothers me, if the veterans aren't wearing the supersuits, doesn't the fact that the new guys wear the suits imply that they're weaker? But really, when giant robot brawls in the desert look better than actual human being fights in the middle of Paris, the producers need to be brave and ask for better material.",G.I.

446,derricklyle,A heck of a lot better than it's sequel,9,7 April 2013,"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra earns the distinction of being the first live action adaptation of the enduring toy line. The motion picture establishes that G.I. Joe is an international counter-terrorist force, and introduces the audience to Duke, Ripcord, Snake Eyes, Scarlett, Heavy Duty, Breaker, Cover Girl, and Hawk. The G.I. Joe force must race against the clock to stop an insidious plot enacted by MARS owner James McCullen. McCullen, a Scottish arms merchant, intends to use nanomite technology, and start a global conflict. He employs Zartan, The Baroness, Storm Shadow, a horde of Vipers, and the enigmatic Doctor. But before the Joes foil McCullen's plot, a more insidious force - COBRA - emerges.If you love action and fast-paced adventure, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra won't disappoint. As far as some ""Joe fans"" are concerned...not every G.I. Joe rejects The Rise of Cobra. It's a faithful, true-blue take on the G.I. Joe team - even with the international agenda in place. While some lament the lack of HISS tanks, the feature film faithfully incorporates people, places and things that are signature G.I. Joe properties. The actors all do great jobs exuding the characters they portray, and the world of the film is one of high tech, sci-fi, and shiny cinema. In my opinion - and as a longtime Joe fan, this feature is superior to its sequel G.I. Joe: Retaliation.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
447,emrys3177,And Knowing is Half the Fun!,7,14 August 2009,"Why do we go to the movie theater? The simplest answer may be to be entertained. This year's lineup of Blockbuster hits has provided comedy, drama, action, fantasy, and did I mention ACTION! If you are large fan of explosions, spectacular special effects, amazing stunts, and a quality cast, you will not leave the theater disappointed. G. I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra contains all of these elements to make this year's Die Hard action film.To break the film down, and endless series of action sequences make up the majority of the film. To be honest, the action scenes are so intense, that one may become bored by a lack of plot due to the immense quantity of action scenes in the film. The film's plot appears to be really solid, but slowly unveils to show lackluster detail with a twinge of hoaky incomplete thought. Don't let this hold you back from enjoying the film. The special effects and creative details applied to the film's action scenes more than compensate for its undefined plot.The cast is well chosen for this caliber of film. Several big name actors and actresses with a few newer talents provided the perfect mix in character development. The films one-liners were acceptable, but the overall dialog could have been improved upon, much the same way Star Wars' dialog was occasionally off cue.Overall, the film is good for those that want to sit back and be entertained without having to think too hard or concentrate on intricate details. Overly critical movie-goers may have an uphill battle trying enjoy this film as a whole. And knowing is half the battle!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

He didn't shoot her, all he did was tell her to drop the case, it was extremely annoying and upsetting, and it pretty much ruined everything for me. What helped the movie recover is the amazing plot twist about how Rex was him from the beginning. The CGI could really be improved, especially the running CGI, I don't even know why they need CGI for running, or for cars. Excess use of CGI, when it comes to the polar bear scene, I was crying. For crying out loud, why do you need to CGI a polar bear? Why don't you just get a real polar bear? Because you wouldn't get it to move?

Too bad for all that FX budget wasted. I would compare this with a low budget porn, the action is there and you may get some satisfaction if you mute the sound, but even so you see those actors, director and especially the writers would better go get real jobs. I admit there is an inherent problem with these superhero action movies where you load the good guys full of power and skill, basically making them unbeatable, but then that would not make a movie if the bad guys would not have a chance in hell, right? A writer with some trace of talent would resolve this somehow believable, but some choose to take the easy way out where the good guys are absolute cretins in real combat, but best ever ... in training, and whenever the bad guys are not around. And of course, if God forbid there is a hot chick playing for the bad guys team, by all means be a gentlemen, open the door and hold the gun for her to blow up your buddies and your expensive hardware.",G.I.

450,olliesco,Stick to the toys and comic books,2,18 April 2013,Terrible film. In the first 10 minutes realised what type of film this was and was not. On paper good cast but fail to deliver on screen. Some were sleep walking through their roles. Plus points Ray Parks and Byung-Hun Lee playing the ninja fighters Snake Eye and Storm Shadow respectively. Good action scenes in a disappointing package.Not sure all that were involved directer Stephen Sommers and writer Stuart Beattie knew the type of atmosphere to create. Is the film a serious action movie or a comedy for kids or somewhere in between. Whedon gets it right with his take on the Avengers sadly Sommers does not.Execution of the plot was all over the place and ended up becoming comical.,G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
451,raindog20,$170 budget and not one writer,3,10 August 2009,"I came in with low expectations and got even less. I'm kind of offended that someone got paid to write this because its essentially a big-budget movie made with a fan-fiction caliber script. The plot riddled with holes, characters speak in clichés and the laws of physics are completely ignored. The female characters are treated with the action-movie standard sexism, and there are some subtle racist undertones as well. Seriously, 12-year-old boys write text messages that are more coherent than this script. The screen writers should use their payday to refund the tickets of everyone who went to see this movie.I'm okay with going a movie just for the special effects, but even that is sub-par. The martial arts choreography is good, and stunning in one scene. The practical effects are believable, but the computer graphics are mostly cartoonish and detract from the visual impact of the film, so its hard to say go see it even if your standard for a good movie is if they blow stuff up in new and interesting ways.I did enjoy the sheer audacity of its failure. Surely the filmmakers had watched even one movie before and knew they had a piece of Star Wars/James Bond ripoff fan fiction on their hands and just tried to be as bad as possible. This movie has a lot of laughs in it, although probably not where the filmmakers intended.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
452,yhpans,Rise of the Cobra - a mixed review,7,24 August 2009,"Just when the summer fest of big-action summer popcorn flicks was about to end, comes one more icing on the cake. This one is from Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, Van Helsing) and gives one helluva tough fight to Transformers movie series that shares similar origins in action figures. Although not much appreciated as a cartoon series (facing tough competitions from Centurions, SilverHawks etc), the movie brings the long-forgotten childhood toys to life again, in style. For those of you who don't know about G.I. Joe's, well they are are said to be the best of the best elite soldiers from all around the world, grouped to form a team, which on paper doesn't exists.The movie takes no time jumping straight to the action, with fast pace science fiction forming the background story. Four nanomite (killer nano bots) warheads are sold to U.S. Army by M.A.R.S. industries which are then continuously tried to be stolen by the opposing minions of the villain, James McCullen - Baroness and Storm Shadow. Although they fail at first when G.I. Joe arrive to save the day, but then a planned raid on the G.I. Joe's lair gets them warheads, destroying of the Effill tower using nanomites, capture of Duke (one of the G.I. Joe's) and finally attack on Washington, Moscow and Beijing via Nanomites armed missiles soon follows. The G.I. Joe are always one step behind the insidious plans of McCullen and Cobra. The entire movie is one long action trip that takes the audiences from US to Egypt to France to North Pole in minor seconds with fights taking place deep in outer space to below the polar ice caps. Cool science, freaky gadgets and shiny swords - its everything packed in one flick. Not only that, the movie also successfully breathes life in the plastic figures (that G.I. Joe once were back in our childhood days) to real flesh and blood people sharing intense feelings like love and revenge. The childhood feud between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, the love plot between Duke and Baroness and the final rise of the Cobra Commander are all well planned and executed. All in all the movie no doubt provides moviegoers with bangs for their bucks.Moving on to smaller (and more important) details - soundtrack, cinematography, action, direction and production design, the movie seems to fare much lesser than the Transformers 2 movie, which had a staggering promotion prior to its release. Although the action sequences are more one-one human fights than pure metal vs. metal approach viewers might tend to still give this one a lesser rating.All in all, G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra, is a retelling of a good vs. evil theme echoing the same sentiment epics like Star wars have told - the greatest of enemies grow from within us. The rising of the Cobra is almost similar to the rising of the Darth Vader, although lesser in grandeur. (So all those who decide not to watch it in theaters, make sure they catch it when Dvdrip print comes out).",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

It takes so many things I once loved and adored and defecates upon their cherished memories. Things I will never be able to cast a loving eye upon henceforth. Such as Duke...Snake Eyes...America...and Denis Quaid.Every cliché you could possibly imagine is here, every telegraphed plot twist, every corny line, every inch of cleavage and glistening biceps, paraded before your very eyes at every and any opportunity that is presented.Fellow Joes, Hollywood has for the last time raped our childhood for the last time!

456,hatthecow,GI Shmoe,1,8 August 2009,"G.I. Joe was the worst movie every made. I have 545 words for this none of which good. The writers for this movie were all twelve years old or at least twelve years old in spirit. Normally this would be good for an action movie if they didn't also have ADD and MPS. Watching this was like watching a yappy dog run around in circles and eating its own excrement. Not only that but they tried to put in as much fan service as possible in the worst possible scenarios. Having the Captain tell me that, ""Knowing is half the battle"" out of no where was unnecessary.It was once said that a good director couldn't direct a good movie with a bad script, but a bad director makes ""G.I. Joe."" There were possible some good action sequences written down but no one could tell because the camera was never focused on the action. Not only was the action so poorly directed but the CGI exploitation made this movie horrible to look at. The CG was bad, and that's being lenient. The CG was unwatchable in some instances the CG made the original movies on Sci Fi channel look like a new Pixar feature. The acting was awful for most of the actors. I had low hopes for any of the actors in this movie but even Christopher Eccleston wasn't giving his best performance, he wasn't even giving a good performance. If the professional actors aren't acting than what hope do the rookies have. I don't expect the acting in an action movie to be good but than why would you cast real actors in an action movie. But for this entire whirlpool of pure bile.The camera work takes the cake for the worst camera work I have seen in a professional movie. There is nothing wrong with keeping tracking shots steady. The ""Shakey Cam"" when used right can be an effective but when used wrong will point the audience in the wrong direction of the action. If you can't see the action in an action movie then there is no point in watching it. I don't care about plot or masterful direction but I want to see the action at the very least. This movie was one of those movies which attempted to take all the good nostalgic feelings I had as a child toward anything and twist them. I knew that G.I. Joe was a bad show when I was watching it as a kid but the rose colored glasses always made me remember it well. This stabbed those memories and then started twisting the knife. Then it took my memories of, ""Doctor Who"" and twisted them horribly. Through the attempts at fan service the writers were more apt toward, ""putting the fans off"" than turning them on. I walked out of this movie angry at the studio that allowed it to happen and the money that they took away from a movie worth watching. I demand an uprising against the studio that would allow this catastrophe to happen. The only redeeming quality of this movie is when it ended. This movie isn't even good for what its worth and anyone who thinks other wise has never seen a real action move. The producers and executives have never seen a real action movie.",G.I.

In fact this summer I was really looking forward to watching a lot of potentially great films but most if not all of them have left me some what baffled. How can Hollywood sanction directors like these to have films like these made. Sub standard plots (albeit there were some moments when one goes 'ah that is quite innovative'), really bad acting from some potentially great actors and in essence sums up a movie of enormous potential to end up being a complete waste of one's time and money.I loved TRANSFORMERS (Part 1) - and when I saw TRANSFORMERS 2 I thought (Was Michael Bay high when he made this????).The say way - I loved THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS - but then when you see GI:JOE you think the same ""Was Stephen Summers on drugs when he made this???""

459,Kalvarius,Snake Eyes is the only good thing,1,7 August 2009,"As a fan of the original series i was not pleased on how accurate the characters were. The only one that was close is Snake Eyes(who is a total bada**) Character flaws (Contains Spoilers) Snake Eyes - in the movie it says that snake eyes was mute because of a vow of silence when really he was in a helicopter accident and had his face scarred and was left mostly mute. Also he should have blonde hair but instead he has brown (kid version) Scarlett - Should have a relationship with Snake Eyes but instead goes for Ripcord???? really......Baroness - Is controlled by cobra?? and her brother is Rex which should really be named Eugene. Had a relationship with Duke in the past which should have never happened. She should be with Destro.Storm Shadow - In the movie he kills his master which should not happen, he was only blamed for it. He and Snake Eyes should be like best friends but Storm Shadow hunts for his uncles killer after he is blamed and later gets brainwashed by Cobra.Zartan - Can only change his appearance through nanomachines instead of illusions and holograms.Cobra Commander - you see his face.....YOU SEE HIS FACE! >:O and he is Baroness's brother Rex??? really..... come on....Accelerator suits are garbage. The Joe's are supposed to be the best of the best military personnel. They never wore performance enhancing suits.I know they wanted to modernize this series and make it all action packed but these character flaws should not be this bad. It would not be hard at all to make the characters how they should be.If you took all the scenes with Snake Eyes and left the rest out it would be 10 times better than seeing the whole thing",G.I.

460,hobbscalvin0,This IS Not GI Joe!,3,13 August 2009,"I have to say, that I for one was sadly disappointed by this film. As per the usual Hollywood rhetoric, the Author's of this had to screw the mythology up, and NOT make GI Joe the Real American Heroes the were and are supposed to be. I had read online that the film makers had received an overwhelming amount of mails from both fans of the animated show and our troops around the globe in reference to their displeasure at the possibility, that this movie was going to become an ""Global International Joint Operations Enforcement"" whatever, and were going to change it back to being about GI JOE: A Real American Hero. So, when my ship pulled into Singapore and I had the chance to watch it, I to begin with, was pleased. Right up to the point when the Character's were introduced and the rest of the Joe's were turned into a NATO Organization. At that moment, I cared less about what was going on, on the screen in front of me, and more about what I was going to do when I got out of there. Good Job Stephen Sommers! You've ruined one of my favorite show's. You know, when I wrote the above statement's I was severely disappointed by the producer's of that movie...if anyone knew nothing about GI Joe, then I can see why they might like it. It has everything you need for a movie blockbuster, it has explosions, fast pacing and likable character's. And I will say this, it gives an origin to all characters in Cobra. But, unfortunately for any Service member, or fan of the 80's Cartoon, for everything it did for Cobra, it crushed everything that GI Joe stands for. When I saw this film, I saw it while my ship (I work for the US Navy) was in Singapore, and for about the first 15 to 20 minutes, all my fond memories were being realized until, ""heavyload"" (?) stated that GI Joe was a Multi-National Operation, basically turning the Joe's from ""AMERICAN HEROES"" to pretty much a castrated UN Peace force...from that moment on myself and one of the two cadets I was with wanted to get up and walk out. Unfortunately, like a car accident we watched not able to look away. Someone I work with asked if I was going to buy the DVD when it came out, and I politely told him, ""I won't buy anything to do with this film, and if someone buys it for me as a gift, i'll politely refuse any ownership of that particuler product."" and unfortunately I like wise will not participate in any future viewings as well as sequel's.

Long story short: There is nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before.In fact, it's so Cliché ridden, it seems comical at times. A friend that sat next to me told me perhaps ten times throughout the movie what was going to happen. In about nine instances, it was exactly what he thought.But you have to love the writer's exposition methods: Character A tells character B what character B did in the past. Just in case he forgot!

It is supposed to be an action movie men should love, but those in my crew agreed with me on how horrible the movie was. One enters believing it will live up to the television show, but ends up brokenhearted by the defiling. The plot line was ""boom bam pow""; no real follow up can be done on it. The acting, if there was any good acting in it, wasn't obvious to me since the inefficiency of the story line takes away from the actors.

After I saw some of the stuff about it I decided to wait till DVD to watch it. I liked it better than I thought I would. Yes, some of it was cheesy, and some of the cgi could have been better (way better), but it was just an action flick, and there was plenty of action. It was the first time (that I know of) that had a flash back in the middle of a fight scene, and still kept the pace. Compared to Transformers 2, it was a good movie. It didn't have the foul mouths that Trans2 did (it did have some that could have been edited out), nor the sexual content (which almost made my wife and I walk out of Trans2). The references to the show and stuff was a big part of liking the movie. And, like I said: it's just an action flick. My wife thought it was too violent, I guess I could handle some of it better (there was not much blood or anything like that except for a few scenes).

You have HORRIBLE acting, in one scene you have ""Duke"", looking into the camera and saying, ""I'm getting you out of here"", and the dude looks like he wants to laugh, while ""trying"" to act serious. You have a plot that a 8 year old wrote, and the CGI, holy crap, who did the CGI, seriously? I've seen better CGI on user made videos on You Tube, I'm not joking. It's bogging my mind to try to figure out how this stuff gets passed through studios, it really makes me laugh. Who directed this, and can you never direct another movie, I pray so!! I wouldn't mind if this was a ""popcorn only"" movie, but when the popcorn is more interesting to you, then what's on screen, there are issues.

But I was wrong in guessing it. I saw a reviewer comparing Transformers 2(T2) and GI. I was actually satisfied with that comparison. To me T2 fails on what it promised, but GI didn't. Though I've given both 7/10, that is because I expected T2 to be of 9/10 which it wasn't and I expected GI to be 6/10 which it exceeded. GI is a good combination of characters and CGI however T2 is only CGI which too sometimes is shaky. I have one more contender to compare ie. Roland's 2012 which has done quite better in CGI but lacks in plot and there is extreme of heroism just like 10000BC. Nice CGI but so many goofs and tattered plots. But I've given GI too 7/10 because GI too lacks few things. Movie is a huge mix-up of multiple action scenes together. At one moment I am enjoying one action scene suddenly another one is pushed in. The pace is little fast and there was not enough time to understand the story and its suspenses. It was all whoosh-shoosh, flash-slash, boom-shoom and a sub-story of movie is over. There was no time for motivational speeches like one in independence day. I like them so much. But thats not so bad to feel about and at-last GI a good movie.

In the short space available for character development between the vast action sequences, the film manages to give interesting tidbits of character personality. Albeit, some casualties in terms of character development are unavoidable in one-and-a-half-hour action movies.The thing that strikes me the most is that the protagonists aren't all American. Most astonishingly, their base is located outside of North America. And the team itself seems to be international (although most accents are distinctively American in vernacular). Given the current political climate and whatnot, those aspects makes this film accessible for me as a non-American and that's just lovely.My two main gripes about the movie is that it's too short and the ending is a bit like a car crash. Suffice to say, the antagonists didn't go down elegantly. But that's not too much of a surprise, since the comics and cartoons go about it the same way: good triumphs over evil and the baddies both badly lose and are sore losers.I'm surprised I like this film more than Star Trek. Sounds blasphemous, I know! But then again, it's got the right ingredients to stroke the male appetite: tits, tech, and torrent.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi and action-packed movies. But G.I. Joe is in a class on it's own. I had to come write a comment to show how frustrated I was after watching the movie. Plot: Non-existent, I guess it was made up as they were shooting.Special effects: Although spectacular, most of the effects leave you shaking your head on how ridiculous some scenes look like.Acting: Some characters were decent but the majority of the acting was just very much predictable and boring.Do yourself a favor and don't waste 2 hours of your time watching the moving, I don't want to see anyone else disappointed like I am.",G.I.

I mean WTF???? Some scenes of the movie were totally fake the special effects were crappy specially in the dessert scene. You could actually tell that there was a green screen not that you don't actually know there is one but at least with such a big budget you expect much more.The whole story was discorded I get it that they should appeal to a bigger audience and change it but PLEASE they should try at least to follow the basic story line.

The writers and producers of this movie have done a superb job of remaking the original G.I. Joe cartoon from the 80's. Although this movie stretched the laws of physics, which is to be expected in a fantasy/sci-fi/action film, the storyline was great and the non-stop action had my family and I thoroughly engaged from beginning to end. I was a big fan of G.I. Joe in the 80's and I must say that it was a real treat to see my favorite characters come to life on the silver screen this weekend. Taking G.I. Joe from cartoon to the big screen was a smooth transition that left us with a true sense of the enormous potential this series has. Each of the actors were excellent choices who portray their characters with passion and vigor. I can hardly wait to see the next installment!! Awesome job on this one, and ya know I gotta say it, YO JOE!!!!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
473,shmoopy259,Real American Zeros,3,10 August 2009,"Funny story. I was just hangin' out the other day, when I got a call. Little did I know that this call would lead to a depression far greater than any I had ever known before. This call was from my grandmother. She was going to be in town for about a month, and she wanted to meet up. So, I said yes.Well that was a stupid idea.She told me, verbatim, ""I saw that G.I. Joe opens this weekend..."". Let me interject here to say that I believed she had seen a commercial and thought to herself that this looked like the kind of movie a guy might want to see. I did not want to see this movie, she continued ""I saw a preview for it, and I think it looks funny"". It was here I realized that she wanted to see G.I. Joe... because she thought it looked funny. She then proceeded to explain a scene from the movie where ""the white guy jumps over a train, and the negro guy jumps through the train"". I almost hung up on her.Where to begin? There was one scene in the movie where two children fight with an intent to kill one another. In any other movie I may have thought this was pretty funny, but the fact that we were supposed to take this seriously, and the fact that one of the children had his head snap back because he was hit in the face with a bread roll, made this scene both disturbing and depressing. When one of the kids grabbed a knife, I was sure we'd just crossed some line that isn't supposed to be seen, let alone acknowledged.The first half of the movie I was somewhat having a kind of okay time. The acting was horrendous, the story was stupid, but we're talking about a movie based on action figures, so that's to be expected. When the movie decided to show some back story set in the Middle East during a firefight though, I was reminded of the far superior ""The Hurt Locker"". After being reminded of such a fantastic film, I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy the rest of what G.I. Joe had to offer. Spoiler Alert: G.I. Joe had nothing else to offer.There were two love stories intertwined within the movie which were there to serve absolutely no purpose at all. There was a lot more death than I expected, and to top it off, all of the jokes fell flat. Had I gone into a coma right after the movie started, and woken up once the credits began to roll, I would still have a residual headache from the stupidity that was prevalent in the theater throughout. G.I. Joe fans will not like this movie, adults will not like this movie, and any self respecting 8 year old should probably just go around back and pick up drinking, because at least then they're killing braincells doing something they'll enjoy.G.I. Joe Gets 3 Dead Braincells out of 10.Oh, and for those of you who care, my grandma H.A.T.E.D. the movie. At least I know she's not entirely senile.

474,bootnuts,What you would expect from a G.I. Joe live action movie,8,6 August 2009,"If you were a child in the late 80's (right before the TMNT explosion), you should have had at least a few Joes in your toy chest. In the animated TV shows, G.I. Joes always had the latest and greatest weapons, G.I Joes always had cheesy one liners you would most often find in a John Wayne flick, but most importantly, G.I. Joes always came out on the right side.This film had all three of those to make for a great G.I. Joe Shmorgasborg!For the most part, the film stayed true to the animated series. If you're like me as a child, you would discuss the rumors from your friends about which Joes switched sides from Joe to Cobra, or which Joes were related to one another (Duke and Falcon, Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes, etc.) Bottom line is to pay attention to the story lines in the film. Overall, if you're a rabid G.I. Joe fan like myself, this is a must see.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
475,rhythm42,"Very entertaining, unbelievable effects.",7,8 August 2009,"I don't usually comment on movies, but due to the poor ratings this movie is receiving, I thought it would be necessary.G.I. Joe is by no means the movie of the decade, but it is an excellent summer action film that anyone can enjoy. What impressed me most with this movie were the special effects. If you really pay attention during the action scenes, you'll notice how much work must have gone into tearing up the streets of Paris, or some of the vehicle battles. The effects rival that of Transformers. Actually, I think they were even better.The plot was also great, very exciting and left it wide open for a sequel. The only disappointing thing about this movie was the music. No ""epic"" tracks like you are used to in Hollywood movies, at least I didn't notice any.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
476,djallman,Better than Schumacher and Clooney's Batman and Robin,4,21 March 2010,"I must say when I saw the previews, I did not think it would be very good. I held out on watching it assuming that it wasn't worth 12 bucks. But I did give in at the local redbox last week. I have always been a fan of G.I. Joe. I collected all of the action figures as a kid, had the G.I. Joe fort, watched the cartoons, and later collected the comics. So on a boring, lonely Saturday night...I watched...and couldn't wait for it to be over. It did have some cool action scenes and some nice special effects (although the special effects even disappointed to a degree). The story was laughable. It was not well thought out and jumped all over the place. I didn't even know what was going on all the time during the action scenes. I expected the dailogue to be sub-par and Tatum didn't disappoint. He was very dull. I actually thought Marlon Wayans may have done the best job. At least his character had personality.All in all, it was very cliché. This could be a pretty cool and well-made franchise. A G.I. Joe movie could have huge potential. But the ball was certainly dropped. With what Zack Snyder has done with the comic and graphic novel genre, or what Nolan did with Batman...maybe something in that direction would add so much more. No character had any depth whatsoever. It was slightly less than average. I do rate it a bit higher than Schumacher and Clooney's Batman and Robin. That was completely awful. I'll even rate it slightly higher than the Fantastic Four series. Very ordinary film. I thought these days movies like popcorn action flicks were of the x-men, iron man, and hulk sort. This was not that.I believe if my 12 year old cousin had a bit more knowledge of military warfare, science, and special effects, he could have written and directed this movie. And if he had, given his age, I would think this movie could be brilliant.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
477,lazx7777,Lots of Unbelievable Action,4,12 October 2009,"Whomever casted this movie aught to be shot! The action although totally unbelievable during most if not all of the France scenes wasn't that bad. Lots of explosions, and who doesn't like explosions? It's obvious they put a lot into the design and it delivers if you like action without acting. The acting totally sucked. These were the worst bunch of actors I've ever seen. Christopher Eccleston tops the charts for the worst actor in the world. Why is he even in films? Sienna Miller is just terrible. The only thing going for her is her looks, which won't last long. And what's with Dennis Quaid? Is he on Prozac or something? It looked like he was reading all his lines off a teleprompter or cue cards, if they still use them. I could go on, but I'm exhausted from this film.One good thing about this movie was Ray Park! Always love watching this guy fight.Anyway if you like good acting don't watch this film. If you can get past the poor acting, rent the DVD simply for the action.All in all, the only thing good in this movie was the CGI. The story, casting, and acting made me want to kill myself.

And to be honest i would never have chosen this film... BUT i'm definitely glad i did end up seeing this! Channing Tatum was definitely working his a*s off for this part and to me he seems a better actor all round now, marlon wayans still bringing his comedy to the film (no doubt in my eyes, my favourite character in the film) and has improved a lot since playing shorty in scary movie. With sienna miller playing Marlon's love interest in the film, sporting her red hair that made her look more attractive than normal, and finally a film of hers i've seen that i like.

The acting was the worst. Everyone's acting, minus the Scottish bad guy, was ridiculous. We did not have to pay to go to this movie thank goodness. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It was not anywhere near as good as the Transformers. Please, Please do not make another one. My kids could of came up with a better script, and my dog could of acted better than most of them! Also the only scene that was good was the one in Paris. It seemed to me they could of made more G.I Joeish by using the theme song and making the guys more tough. I mean seriously, that red head.

The team in this movie doesn't fight for the United States, but instead takes orders from some multinational NATO complex. The ""Real American Hero"" isn't an American Hero at all. I honestly cannot believe they screwed up something so basic. Perhaps they did this to help in international sales, but that only goes to show how willing they were to sacrifice key features of the original show for money.And it also defies all logic in that most people in other nations know that Joe is largely identified as an American hero. According to the logic of the film-makers, that means James Bond shouldn't work for British Intelligence out of fear of alienating American audiences. James Bond is the classic British secret agent, and American audiences love him for it. Having Bond work for the UN, NATO, or some other organization would destroy the character.I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It is a missed opportunity and it blatantly ignores key features.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
483,TheDarkKnigh7,A really entertaining movie!,8,21 August 2009,"If you enjoy non-stop ballistic action from a movie then G.I Joe: Rise of Cobra is for YOU!Now i am not what you call a HUGE fan of the original cartoons and comics, but i was very familiar with many of the characters and i knew of the basic story of Joes VS Cobra. The characters themselves don't really wear any of their traditional costumes(especially Duke and Ripcord with their modernized costumes)with the exception of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. And this isn't really a bad thing considering all the costumes are pretty cool.Pretty much the coolest character in the movie was in-fact Snake Eyes. He is the classic character that is easily likable especially when he is swinging around his Katana and shooting guys in the head with a pistol. Not to mention, Snake Eyes not talking was just a cool element to give to the character. I also have to note that this a movie for pure fun entertainment, and nothing more. With that being said, the movie can be really cheesy(pretty much every scene with Dennis Quaid) and the acting can be sub-par. But i didn't go into this movie expecting a Forrest Gump performance. I expected to see a good action flick with a good story, great visuals, and some AWESOME characters. And i was happily not disappointed.

As many have stated this movie is just bellow transformers 2 in explosion. But this movie has what the new transformers doesn't have, an actual story line.In this movie we see the ""Joes"" fighting the ""Cobra"". The action in the movie is relentless, but there is also a vast portion of story in between. In which case this movie succeeds transformers. Also the comic re leaf in the movie is not as campy or idiotic as it is in its competitor (Transformers 2). the visual effects in this movie could be better at points but it is good for what it is.The movie also centers more around the characters unlike transformers. There may have been a few plot holes in the movie but if you pay attention, the story returns to points that may be missed. Also the movie doesn't leap frog around like others do now a days. It has one main story and it follows through to the letter.The new film differs from the original basses of G.I Joe who are all American war heroes and make do with what they have. This film breaks away by adding a futuristic feel about it. witch I was fine with because I think the series should have gotten an update, because remember it was originally made in the 80's.In my Opinion this movie will do a lot better than most people will expect and will succeed more popular movies out right now.",G.I.

Way to ruin two old-school childhood icons. Now let's get some ""good"" actors, not just in shape and a flavor of the month.

486,raym-18,Great piece of prolonged commercial,5,6 August 2009,"The film is based on Hasbro's action figure franchise, given the state-of-the-art technology with everlasting action sequences.Okay, it's the deal. If you go for pure excitement, it's the right choice. If you look for a meaningful screenplay with unforgettable acting, forget this.Stephen Sommer, the director of the Mummy and its sequel, managed to fill the screen with boom blast, action and and CG, and hilarious dialogs. His careful planning on every moment did catch our full attention. Frankly, the never-ending adventure is entertaining, particularly the chasing scene in Paris.Compare with The Mummy, he did focus on character's build up by placing a seemed-to-be complicated relationship among the characters (e.g. the affair between Duke and Baroness).However, the screenplay is rather stupid and full of flaws. The relationship built-up among characters is childish, and the story itself disregards physics and science (Its rather ironic as the technology is held to be the major selling point).I would say, G.I. Joe is a little bit better than Trannsform: Rise of Falling, as it is not emphasized on a rich storyline. By the way, the truth is, I am tired of the CG action genre.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

The few characters who's names were familiar, most, looked nothing like the characters I remember. I never remember snake eyes as such a muscle bound person and I don't recall ripcord at all. Maybe he was in the newer G.I. Joe's that came out? I'm curious to know who came up with the concept that Duke and the Baroness had a past love affair? That was completely off. Where are all the characters from the cartoon Lady Jaye, Flint, Gung-ho, Alpine, Bazooka, Ship wreck, etc, etc, etc? I understand that this needed to be a new story, something that hadn't been done before, but wow, talk about throwing something together.

488,alexander-c-2,"Excellent, fast-paced action flick.",8,7 August 2009,"G.I. Joe is a thrilling experience.Yes, on RT it dropped from 93 - 41 pretty much overnight and it's not faring excellently on IMDb with a 6.3 either. Don't let these bad ratings throw you off.It is an excellent action film. I think most will agree that the action sequences are well directed, engaging, and pretty damn kickass. It's certainly an edge of the seat experience right through the film. While that may be entertaining, it has its shortcomings too. The cast and acting is average. For many this doesn't bother them, but you've been warned. The plot is passable. While it's not complex or very sophisticated at all it's sufficient, well paced and really brings out those action sequences.I've never been into the G.I. Joe figurines so I can't say much as to whether it delivers on its legacy, though many comment that they were disappointed because of the axed characters and modified storyline. Yes, many characters were dropped but I'd imagine it'd be quite difficult to have more than 8 characters in leading roles. So I actually appreciate this decision on the directors part. The storyline still contains the main elements present in the GI Joe franchise.The foremost point to remember is to not compare this with the action figures. It probably doesn't deliver on the franchise but as an individual film, the director's vision has created an excellent piece.In closing, if you're looking for a STANDALONE well-paced and exciting flick, you won't be disappointed.",G.I.

Plot holes were more prevalent than the story itself. Essentially, the entire screenplay from concept to execution, both by the actors and the director, was a disaster. - The special effects were very poor.How this movie ever made it past the first few weeks of filming is beyond me. How anyone ever let it be released to theaters is an even more prevalent question. Growing up watching GI Joe and owning a large number of the toys and spending a great deal of time reading the comics, I now feel as though this movie has stolen/ruined a piece of my childhood. If I could forget that I saw it, I would.The audience, myself included, spent a large portion of the movie groaning. We laughed at the attempts to be serious - not with the movie, but AT IT. Wayans attempts at comedy rarely managed a chuckle from the audience.Overall, don't see this. Don't rent it. Don't do anything that may encourage them to make a sequel.

Sadly, this movie blew away even the most remote chances of it being anywhere near decent. I almost felt insulted as I watched the movie, having to bear through endless cheesy one-liners, terribly acted one-dimensional characters, and over-dramatic action scenes. Even the CGI wasn't up to par and at one point I could have swore I saw a car explode before it hit the ground...Overall the only entertainment my friends and I had extracted from this worthless movie how hilariously bad it was.

492,j_g_2501,Fan of the original - Surprised after skeptical expectations,8,8 August 2009,"First off, this is an action movie aimed at bringing in fans of the GIJoe ""war-toy"" both young and old. Those with political views, age demographic, or interests that do not fit the target audience are probably better off spending their time in some other way--fair warning.As a fan who grew up with the original 1980s cartoon TV show and comic books, I was skeptical about how true to the original this GIJoe / Cobra movie would be...especially after being disappointed with the recent Transformer movies. After avoiding many of the trailers and spoilers on-line, I approached the movie with an open mind. Thus, I feel that I was well pleased and entertained by this movie.I was not crazy about some of the departures from the original source material in this movie...particularly, I did not like the relatively generic uniforms and some of the character choices/changes on the GIJoe team. Fans of the original comics and cartoons will pick up on all the ""tampering"" with the original characters. From the general perspective of trying to make a ""fun action movie"", I understand why they changed the characters, but I wish they would have been truer to the original.This movie is very much one that attempts to explain the revised origins of the characters and organizations in the GIJoe world. They actually did a good job of giving the audience some back story while keeping the action going. The movie follows the ""standard Cobra plot"" to take over the world while GIJoe tries to stop them. I had no expectations of deep, thought provoking dialog and drama there. You will see plenty of fast paced action with cool tech...some of which you may be interested to know are actually in development by military contractors, Japanese research companies, and universities. I do not want to spoil things by listing the tech that you will see in this movie...just search for what you see afterward if you are fascinated with the tech like me. ;-) The special effects are on par with what one would expect from a big summer movie, and the for those who like action...it's pretty much non-stop. I did not feel bored with the action like I did with some of the fight sequences in the recent Transformers movies. I wish I could have seen more cameo's of GIJoe characters, but since no one was wearing their token uniforms from the original GIJoe stories you probably would not be able tell who the characters in the background were supposed to be. They missed an opportunity to fill the backgrounds of the scenes with a rich set of characters like George Lucas tends to do in Star Wars.If you are a fan of the original, be prepared for some significant differences, sit back & enjoy...you may find yourself musing about the sequel like me.",G.I.

When I first saw the trailer for this, I knew I had to see this movie, I was like a kid at Christmas and couldn't wait for the morning to finally open the big present, only to find it was a rock... I would say a lump of coal, but at least that would be useful for something other than to throw at someone. Something I would like to do to the writers, director and producers of this movie... I don't only want the money I wasted on this movie back, I want the time that was wasted on this movie. It doesn't matter if you were a fan of the Comic book, or the TV show... I personally liked both, but where did they get the idea to make Cobra Commander and the Baroness brother and sister?? Oh yeah, and Cobra Commander was Dukes buddy? and the Baroness was Duke's Fiancée?? I have an idea, let's remake the Wizard of Oz, and have the wicked witch be the good guy and Dorothy be the evil villain... I think it will work as well as this movie... When I first see Snake Eyes, I think yes, this rocks... Little do I know they screw up every major development in the entire story line of either. It looks like they try to follow the comic book story line, except Scarlett is Ripcord's love interest, she is not with Snake Eyes... There is so much I could talk about how awful this movie is, but I can't. I didn't care for the second Transformers Movie, but if I had to go watch either one of these two films again, it was a much better movie than this one. I warn all of you that have not seen this movie yet, do not go, if you love the TV show and the Comic Book. I don't want to see anyone else disappointed like I am.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra

When I went to see the movie, I just hoped to see my childhood heroes in the flesh, but I actually got much more than what I bargained for. The plot was typical for G.I.Joe, and anyone who went to watch the movie expecting more shouldn't complain about it. The characters were brought to life magnificently, and the ruthlessness of Cobra was portrayed just as it should. I was only disappointed that one of my favorite Joe's Shipwreck was not included. The action sequences were spectacular and it is one non-stop roller-coaster ride from start to finish. There is never a dull moment and if you are an ardent fan like myself, then you will thoroughly enjoy the movie.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
495,contact-1848,15 reasons why The Rise of Cobra Movie is everything G.I. Joe isn't!!!,1,10 August 2009,"Filled with entire disappointment a lot of people at the movie theater with astonishment saw my angered expression, when I stood up at the end of the hideous film and cried out loud: That is not G.I. Joe!!! I entered the movie theater with a programmed mindset in hopping that the post I made nearly a month ago in my blog about the Joe's movie, would be totally wrong.Unfortunately, as G.I. Joe footage passed on my unconvincing eyes... I couldn't trick my mind no more, till it screamed inside: Your instincts where right, the G.I. Joe Movie totally sucks!!! At this point, I don't know which goes for the title of the worst comic movie adaptation ever: Either Dragon Ball Evolution or G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra!!! What I do know, is that the G.I. Joe Movie is not only disrespectful to fans, but I'll give you 15 reasons why it is not true original G.I. Joe comic book film material: 1) Destro used the metal mask by family tradition. Never imposed by the Cobra Commander itself.2) Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow met and where great buddies in Vietnam. Not rival kids as the movie says.3) It was Zartan who killed the Hard Master, not a deceiving Storm Shadow kid as the movie portrays it.4) Originally, Storm Shadow never took off his mask.5) Cobra Commander's transformation is never to the breathing mask. It is to the classic chrome helmet or hoodie mask. That was the BIGGEST disappointment in the film!!! 6) Ripcord was an expert and skilled halo skydiver, not a pilot.7) Scarlett was in love with Duke and at some time had a crush on Snake Eyes, not Ripcord.8) Snake Eyes didn't do a vow of silence for the Hard Master's assassination. It was because his face was partially disfigured in a helicopter accident.9) Cobra Commander became evil by the sorrow he felt of his brother's car accident death. Not because he was given as MIA (Missing In Action) as the film lies to tell, as a result of a bomb run on a facility target.10) The original Pit was secretly based under Stanten Island not under the desert, that was way much later and happened first in Utah and then moved to Arizona.11) It was the Cobra Commander and Destro who originally attacked the Pit for the first time.12) Cobra Commander and the Baroness where never brother and sister.13) The Baroness was from the start in love with Destro, not Duke.14) It was Destro who created the Iron Grenadier Soldiers, not the Cobra Commander.15) Cobra Headquarters, where based in an island somewhere secretly hidden in the Gulf of Mexico.""So when everything else fails, the movie also fails in"": Bad voice dialogues, really crappy CGI effects as a matter of fact It looks like if you are watching a demo, corny romance story, bad plot and Sigma 6 emphasis not the classic G.I. Joe every fan expected.The only good thing and true to series is the Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow rivalry and the hot, very hot Baroness outfit, without leaving apart the smokin Scarlett gal outfit also. But for everything else the movie The Rise of Cobra is a torture to your eyes!!!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
496,russelllframpton,I need Brain surgery!,1,12 August 2009,"OK so lets have loads of money on Special effects then that way we cant get any good actors or spend any money on a good screen play!! GI JOE was a fantastic child hood memory for me as it was known in the UK Action Force! This film was bad how Hasbro gave the go ahead for it i have no idea as Transformers was quite good! So lets have every main character in this film be related in some laughable way and lets forget the whole idea about how Cobra did rise! and change that too! When we do see Cobra Commander at the end of the movie after he has been Rex Lewis (Baroness brother, dukes best friend then the Doctor with a Corba) that whole scene was shocking with the Vipers and the Cobra in the tank Pointless they could have just shot a Viper to prove the point! what was with Destro as well he should have just put the mask on from his family's past rather than being injected with a poor plot line!!! Why did Cobra Commander change his mask what was the point not any disfigurement on him from the Doctor! This film was really bad and really pointless it needs to be filled with Ang Lees Hulk and then remade Well done Mr Sommers for making an awful film i am so annoyed about this movie i need it erased from my memory along with AVP 1&2! How can someone destroy a Franchise which is loved by millions do not see this film it is shockingly bad!!!!!!!!!!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
497,budden10,"Only boring movies are approved by critics, and this IS NO BORING MOVIE!!",10,12 August 2009,"To Paramount or any of the critics: This movie was good. Not great. Not a classic. But it was good. A fun 2 hours, and money well spent.This movie wasn't made for Roger Ebert, or the New York Times. It was made for the audience, and I'm not talking about the ones who select ""best picture"" or ""actor nominees"" at movie awards. I'm talking average joe blow here. I mean seriously, did anyone besides the critics actually like ""The curious case of Benjamin Button""? Not me. and from I take, not many did. That's why Im asking paramount to really stop listening to the critics reviews and start listening to the paying public.Sure the acting wasn't Oscar worthy. Sure the CGI wasn't ""OMG no way can that be fake"" realistic. And sure, everyone and they're brother has something to pick about it. But it was never meant to be something like the Dark Knight or the Godfather.It was meant to be a GI Joe movie. A fun, full action, time spent where for two hours, you can watch a fantasy world and ENJOY EVERY MINUTE OF IT. And that it did, and well.I think that this movie surprised most. I hope that paramount listens to certain areas of complaint from the average movie go-er (I.E. Better CGI) and make a second one with those corrections in it, and you'll have a pretty good movie.Transformers 2 was only considered a ""success"" because of the anticipation built from everyone watching transformers 1. The movie itself wasn't really that good.GI Joe never had that, but it does lay a good foundation to continue a really good story line, while having room to make the second one a significantly better movie completely reasonable and doable.For the record, I think GI Joe was a better movie then transformers 2. Just fix the obvious issues with GI joe in the second one and people will come see it.Overall, I think this was a great movie made for a great audience who were just looking for a fun time, and not for critics who's opinions really don't matter when it comes to the grand scheme of things.Don't listen to the negativity. Its a good movie and worth the time to go see it. Not the dark knight, but its just as fun!! Bring on JOE 2!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
498,pschorf2,What I expected,8,12 August 2009,"If you go into this movie expecting a decent action movie, you won't be let down. It was about what I expected a live action GI Joe movie to be...the good guys were good, the bad guys were bad, and Knowing was Half the Battle. My only real complaint was that some of the acting was sub par. I was really happy and surprised to see Jonathan Pryce as the president, and Dennis Quaid did a pretty believable performance without phoning it in. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was an interesting choice for the Doctor, and also did a fairly good job. I wasn't very impressed with the actors who played Duke and Ripcord. Although I'm a fan of newer superhero movies like The Dark Knight, I didn't want a GI Joe movie to be as dark or morally ambiguous as newer movies tend to be. On the whole, it was a fair summer action movie that didn't try to be anything more.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
499,jacobsevanes,"Does contains spoilers, but please read because it'll save you money.",1,15 August 2009,"Bad expectations, movie even worse.I went to see this movie because a friend of mine really wanted to go there and I thought: why not, I didn't hate transformers 2 (although it wasn't really good), and I had seen the trailer with the Eiffel Tower scene which looks pretty amazing. The rest of the film was pretty amazing too. But not amazing in a good way. I just couldn't believe how bad it was. I am actually still amazed as hell. The story is so crappy that I think I could write a thousand stories which are better. Here is a series of 'highlights'. It all starts in the Middle Ages, where some weapon maker is being punished for selling weapons to both sides. This has almost nothing to do with the film except that the weapon maker is an ancestor of a really bad guy in the movie. Then there is a transport of very high tech rockets which are almost stolen by some guys with really high tech weapons, but some other guys with high tech weapons come to the rescue. (indeed, every weapon in the movie is high tech, like year 3009 high tech). The rescue guys appear to be a special forces team called G.I. Joe. The surviving guys from the transport really like to join the team, but they need to be trained first. At the end of the first day of training they are almost scoring highest in the history of the team, so they are done. Right. Then the bad guys come in and steal the rockets. This time they succeed so the G.I. Joes need to get them back. This results in some really good action scenes including the Eiffel Tower coming down. It all looks really realistic. But after this it's only down the hill. The bad guys seem to have built a base under the polar ice, the size of a little city. Somehow no one ever noticed something happening there. Or everyone knew but just didn't inform G.I. Joe. By the way: it actually wasn't really cold out there somehow, because a lot of people didn't wear special clothes while walking around on the ice and it didn't seem to bother them at all. Or the actors just didn't know how to act like it was cold. That is possible because none of the actors was really looking like he/she cared a lot. Marlon Wayans was probably the least bad while he wasn't even funny. I think that says enough. The polar base is destroyed after a fight won by the good guys and because of the explosions the polar ice sinks together with the base. Yes, dear readers, the ice sinks. So alls well that ends well. oh, first one of the good guys needs to take down some rockets the bad guys managed to shoot just before the base was destroyed. Somehow the rockets can only be taken out by a supersonic plane that can only be controlled by speaking Celtic, which one of members of G.I.Joe happens to speak. So actually it's not really a problem, I think. Maybe it is a problem, I don't know, but it just doesn't make sense. Nothing in the whole script makes any sense. I still don't believe it. I'm sorry guys, it's overwhelming me. I need to stop writing or I'll start crying or worse. Just remember: don't watch the movie!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
500,dukedevil1170,"Wow, its so bad its entertaining, I laughed so much",1,16 August 2009,"Okay, so this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was kick-out out of District 9 which is supposed to be orgasmic and so I watched about 20 minutes of this before having to release my mind from being numb and go watch Harry Potter. In the time I watched this I saw all I needed to. I will describe just a few minor aspects. Action will be the first. From the second I got inside the theater I was blinded with a collage of mind blowing explosions, ridiculous stuff to say the least, jet packs, flying spaceships, bombs, grenades. It would dwarf the fight at Normandy. Right afterward this guy and girl start talking and have a little flirty/romantic and funny conversation. This is right after some life changing horrific fight in which all their friends died. Then each consecutive scene was the same, just off the charts action. One scene a guy went running towards a building to get his friend out before an air strike, yes an air strike and about 10 feet away the bombs land. Yes, 10 feet away bombs landed from this courageous friend and throw him flying and he just gets up and walks away. Dude, he got about 10 feet off the ground!!!!!!! He would be so burned, dead, toasted!!!!!! Then, I have another small rant. Whats with GM advertising their crap in everything, I see H2s in every CSI show, every movie, and they're always used as bad ass manly vehicles. Dude, they are 40,000 cars with chrome, TVs, leather seats, those pieces of crap are the most despicable ridiculous cars I've ever seen, hey, if you want to have one I won't insult you, but don't ever for a second imagine they are manly or bad ass or tough, thats what Jeeps are, that why Jeeps don't have air conditioning, power windows, locks, or seats. Every single scene in this movie managed to have a massive black H2 somewhere getting blown to bits or chased or jumping or wrecking or being bad ass. It just made me mad to see every single scene somehow sneak in one of those monstrosities. The scene towards the end in Paris! Wow, trying to write a fitting response to it would be an adventure Jules Verne could only explain. So its a car chase, like I said, if there are cars they will be H2s, so yes, the bad guys and good guys both have H2s, what a coincidence!!! At one point a rocket is shot and careens the rear end of the bad guys and the car jumps into the air somewhere between 15 and 20 feet and lands. Dude, a ROCKET! That would blow a tank to bits, it would rock a whole street block, but hey! Its an H2, so it keeps on trucking. Then a guy gets on the side of the bad guys H2 and starts hitting the passengers, the driver turns into a mac truck and knocks him off. So now the car has been hit by a rocket and hit a mac truck, but hey! Its an H2, so it keeps on trucking. Then, as described before, a series of explosions occur that numbed my brain to such a degree I can't fully recall the other potentially catastrophic explosions and accidents that befall the bad guys H2 BUT THEN!!!!!!!!!! After a short scene showing the good guys, the bad guys H2 is shown IMACULATE, yes, and not like an accident little shot or anything like that, but for the rest of the scene, its perfect. After it got off the ground, blown up, hit, wrecked, beat up, shot and all this other stuff. This is what I believe sums the whole movie. A clusterfuch of ridiculously overwhelming violence and explosions that just numb the brain and its shown like its normal. The director doesn't even care to show the characters remorse or emotion, its played off like nothing, no one feels pain and of course the H2s keep on trucking. Also, I would like to note that the ninja in the movie is Korean. Ninjas are Japanese! He doens't speak English and its so obvious it made me hurt. He either has a mask and is so poorly dubbed or turns his head every time he speaks it just hurts to see how bad a movie can really be. The logistics to this whole movie are so bad I couldn't even concentrate on what the plot was. At one point this bomb was going off but it was like a gas cloud eating the Eiffle Tower and the GI Joe hits a deactivate button to end the gasses from expanding. Dude, thats so ridiculous it makes me laugh. This movie made me feel pain, laughter, regret, and loss of hope for the action movie industry. Its a pain to behold its true greatness as the worst movie I've ever seen.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
501,ihatedgijoe,Don't waste your money.,1,17 August 2009,"First off, I would like to say that I created an IMDb account for the sole purpose of warning others about this terrible crap movie. At first, I was really excited to see the GI Joe movie. I got to the movie theater, and my friends and I were the only ones in the theater. I didn't think anything of it, I just thought that being alone would make the movie even better. Now I know why I was the only one in the theater. GI Joke was a horrible movie. It is a contender for the coveted title of the worst movie of the year. This movie was awful. I have pooped out better movies than this. The acting-crap. The casting-terrible (who cast Marlon Wayans in a serious part?) Character Development-absent Fight scenes-overdone and absurd Special effects-decent, but not good enough to distract me from all the suck around it. The only cool part was when they were chasing the car in Paris, but I have a hard time believing that one of the guys could catch up with the other after falling back like half a mile, but neither of them could gain thirty feet to catch the car they were chasing. This movie was sooooooooo cheesy and predictable. Who would have thought that duke and Anna would end up together? Who would have thought that snake eyes would killed his brother in the final showdown, and still keep his vow of silence? Who would have thought that Marlon wayans would have ended up with the redhead? And what the **** is up with cobra commander? He's just darth vader with a monocle. And why in gods green earth would they show you cobra commander's face?!? That's unacceptable. Shame on the writers, shame on the directors, shame on the actors, producers, and editors for making such a disgraceful movie as this. Do yourself a favor and burn your ten dollars. It'll be more amusing than spending it to watch this crap.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
502,hibsdaft_1,Cheesy Kids Film,4,17 August 2009,"I think this film was not worth the effort to go and see. The characters are so cheesy and the plot line is so predictable and one dimensional. Bascily for a lot of the script it felt like the director had just stolen parts of other story's such as Star Wars' Death Star for the underwater lair and the Duel scene between the ninja's! They even managed to squeeze a bit of Independence Day in when Duke is fleeing in the miniature submarine. Also I don't understand why people insist on using actors who cannot clearly display an accent tied into the script, they where awful! Some of the Scottish accents actually offended me and the rest of the people in the audience! Not to mention the fact that the director seems to think we all speak in Celtic? You'd be lucky to meet anyone who spoke Gaelic which is the actual name of the language. All in all the film was a let down and will be nothing more than a film to watch with your pre-teen kids. Even so if they have an ounce of taste they probably would not like this either.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
503,position1227,"It was a good movie, but it could have been better",6,19 August 2009,"I went to go see G.I. Joe the day after it came out and was pretty excited about seeing it. However, my expression changed as i was leaving the theater. Don't get me wrong; it was a good movie, but their were several scenes that i thought could have been better.The beginning was good and kept me interested, introducing each character and their origin. It also throws you straight in the action and keeps you interested about why everyone hates each other.Around the chase scene is where I start to question the director. While the chase scene was interesting, i did see some flaws. One was that the cobra vehicle the Joe's were chasing showed damage at times (i.e. After hitting 20 cars without any armor, it shows no damage, but after it puts on its armor and is hit with a mere arrow, there is a huge dent in its side door.). Also, the crash at the end of the chase was very unrealistic and could have been done a lot better.After the chase scene, their were a lot of cut scenes and flashbacks that hinted at the ending. The cut scenes really took the excitement out of the ending and other parts of the movie The ending is what really disappointed me. Not only did it end with a cheesy punch line, they killed too many key villains in the series, such as snake eyes, which left me to think: ""Who is he going to fight in the next movie?"" But the main reason why I was disappointed was that they didn't show the main villain! It's called ""The Rise Of Cobra"" yet Cobra is no where to be found, he is only mentioned.",G.I.

I remember those times where I would watch Saturday cartoons anticipating the fatigue wearing, Cobra busting soldiers. This movie is based on a 1998 screenplay by John Paul Kay and I am quite disappointed in this movie. First the movie goes in such a fast pace that it leaves holes through the story. The reason why I enjoy movies so much is that people take their time to write, develop the story so the viewer would then build a relationship with the characters. I found that the characters were pretty bland. The only thing that I give this movie credit for is some of the CG chase scenes. Overall you get a lot of GI but not enough Joe.

The romance between the African- American protagonist (Marlon Wayans) and the redhead (Rachel Nichols) was too artificial. Every single thing in the movie was cliché and highly boring.I confess I fell asleep after watching an hour of this movie! The remorse I felt after the end of this movie was overwhelming. It was like the content of the movie was so insulting that I could not believe I had wasted 118 minutes of my time on this movie! I totally do not recommend you to watch this movie!

The star casting is nice, this movies makes the whole plot very clear, did not make the audience confused, it explain every little detail nicely, completely .

If you are looking for an intricate plot asking though provoking questions, and showing growth of character, why are you reading this, cause this film is not for you! All that this film offers is a fast and fun ride where you can shut down the higher brain functions, munch popcorn, watch things blow up and bad guys get shot. I haven't had this much fun since I stopped playing with action figures last month :).For the die hard G.I. Joe fans there are characters changes, expect them and accept them. These characters are like a freshly opened blister pack each action figure may look the same but their back story comes from the mind of the child who open it in this case thats Stephen Sommers.

The action quality is superb and the whole movie is filled with awesome cgi effects that i think a live Action GI Joe movie would demand. As for the story line.... GI Joe is all about fighting with cobra and such terror organizations so, its understandable that the makers didn't need to put in a very intense story line into it.You don't really need to explain the entire GI Joe universe setting to People who have no clue about this franchise.People who did not know anything about GI Joe before they saw the movie, would have understood what GI Joe is all about after seeing it. The best thing about this movie was that it wasn't just another senseless crash and burn American flick.... it stayed to its roots of the franchise and did exactly what the theme of the GI Joe universe demands.

Starting from the white ninja (remembered me the old Dadikoff's -I think- series with white, silver, orange ninjas :)), the kid who killed his kung fu master, more: the two kids beating each other so hard that they could easily kill a grown one and ending with the ice sinking, close to the end of the movie. It has many more other, I smile when I remember the guy in the underwater facility with the torch, burning the walls - I think he appears twice, consuming the air, otherwise so precious there.

There no much mystery because it's not an intellectual movie and it can be 3 movies in one. If you like action, you'll not regret this excellent choice. There are individual fights, team fights and whole army fights. Ground fight, underwater fights, city fights. Conventional and fututistic guns fights. The plot and interest of this movie is in the new trend in nano and magnetic guns and human control systems (like surrogates for eg) The acting was better than expected, amazing techno settings. the storyline is original as it could hope to be, and, all in all, it is certainly a movie I suggest to fans of action.

I saw the cartoon series and a saw in the movie that it had more sense but it was loyal to the action sequence.The story is great and precise it doesn't turn to a boring story about each character and the relation of baroness with duke was cool because it forms like a tension that whats gonna happen with them. Snake eyes rules and storm shadow their fight and the past relation of them was a great story of their never ending fight.

There is a pretty cool chase scene but beyond that this movie is a fail. And why do movies nowadays have to push the interracial thing. Being a white guy it Really rubs me the wrong way. I'm surprised they didn't cast Will Smith as the token in this movie. Seems like the kind of role he would love (I hate Will Smith). Does anyone know why I must write ten lines of text for this to be submitted. Way to be retarded IMDb.,G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
516,markelane,Awful,2,8 November 2009,"This Movie follows the Michael Bay Formula for bad movies 100% Absolutely awful in every way. Cheesy effects, horrible dialog, NO PLOT, no emotion, no thought, I can't believe this movie got made in this way. Embarrassing for every one who worked on this movie, financially and artistically... Avoid, it isn't worth your time or dollar in any way. Where has the thought gone in movies? Do the producers, slash directors, slash coffee getters, really think we are all this stupid? This one left such a soar taste in my mouth I had to review. I remember this in cartoon mode as a kid, cheesy as it was, this is just embarrassing. Bad acting, horrible writing, typical ""hollywood"" lets think the people are stupid movie. AVOID!!!!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
517,BigRickySBH,I can't get that 2 hours back,2,30 November 2009,"It doesn't get any worse than this movie. Thank goodness we only rented it for $1. If I had paid full price at the theater, I would really feel ripped off. So many of the scenes in this movie were direct ripoffs from other ""real"" movies. I saw so many ""Star Wars"" and ""Independence Day"" ripoffs that I felt those writers should get royalties.For example, when Duke makes the big escape and the ex blond gets into the ""gun turret"" and starts shooting, I flashed back to Luke and Han in the falcon. I wanted to hear ""Don't get cocky kid"".The whole end scene at the cobra base was unnecessary. The US has subs with missiles on patrol 24/7. Once they found the base, it should have been like the t-shirt says. ""24 empty missile tubes, a mushroom cloud, now its Miller Time!"" They already KNEW what the warheads could do.Instead it was the typical drawn out battle including the mano y mano ninja fight. (Can you say Star Wars ESB Luke and Vader fight scene complete with the fall!) And by the way, ice floats. Anyone who has ever had an ice cube in their Coke knows that. Give me a break!!!!",G.I.

518,mice-sk,Disappointing,4,31 January 2010,"I saw this movie in a cinema yesterday, and I'm sorry to say that I expected much more from it. I was expecting to see a good action flick, but similarly as with the new Terminator movie, I ended up disappointed.The action is there, but you do not feel it (I'm not 100% sure, but I think that I've actually fallen asleep during one action scene). Also, you are presented with character-bonding interludes and attempts to unveil the G.I. Joe universe, but I found them very weak (I don't blame the actors, I blame the script). CGI effects for this kind of movie should also have been many times better.I just hope that if there will be a follow-up movie, it will use the G.I. Joe franchise to its full potential.",G.I.

519,bigtrav425,Just a few things that was wrong with the movie,6,31 January 2010,"Whoever let this script thru,produced it and directed it needs to NEVER do another movie.Their are quite a few things wrong with this movie and i hope Hasbro didn't have the final say in the script because it was a mess!.....Where to start?...First how in the hell can u have Ripcord over any number of Joe's mainly Lady Jaye,Wild Bill,Roadblock,Stalker,Shipwreck,Gung-ho etc etc.How could u start the Joe's w/o having Duke in their first? The Baroness( who is HOT as hell in this movie BTW) Switches sides(presumably) already?? If you plan on having a part 2 why would you kill off Storm Shadow already as well?!?!..Did Dr.Mindbender die in the Explosion or no?? Why wasn't the Twins in the movie? Major Bludd? Shouldn't Heavy Duty be shooting more Heavy guns or shooting more period?? Why was Breaker played by a Mexican or whatever he was? How did the Joe's base NOT have a alarm with all the new equipment that it had? their are a few other things i wanted to bitch about but slipped my mind!..Id like to know who made the final call on this tho..I hope Part 2 is better because this is a kinda movie u could make 3-4 parts of it easily like spider man but they didn't start off to well",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
520,mik-nils,Horrific,1,9 March 2011,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in the last few years, in terms of writing, acting, special effects...well all of it really. Being based, just like the Transformers films, on a plastic action toy, it is obviously not a piece of highly sophisticated film-art and nobody expected (or wanted) it to be. It is a typical high budget Hollywood action flick consisting of explosions, cheap one-liners, male models with leather-clad six-packs, that guy from Scary Movie, a Russian supermodel (Karolina Kurkova) and an attractive famous-by-association-to-Jude-Law actress. All's well thus far. The perfect ingredients to an entertaining no-brainer. Only, the movie fails to be the least bit entertaining. You know it's a disaster when even the mid-puberty boys were yawning throughout the screening despite perfectly styled women in action/fetish-gear. Even the $150 million special effects look utterly crappy. On the bright side for Sienna Miller's career (does she still have one other than bedding famous men and ""designing"" clothes?) - nobody will remember this role and most people won't even know it's her in that brunette disguise. Always look on the bright side of life.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
521,CrixMcGuffin,Fun but cgi too fast,3,23 September 2011,"Switch the mind off to realism and facts and don't blink. Someone commented that Rachel Nichols was a bad actress in it, that prompted this review. I personally thought she was the best thing in it compared to Sienna Miller's bad acting skills (see comment about ""Nice shoes"" about half way through movie) Paris Hilton would have given it more feeling. The speed of the action scenes are probably watchable if you down several treble shot espressos just before watching. The main reason for only giving 3/10. Overall, 2 hours of mind numbing action. It could be worse, it could be real. The ending is left open so there will be many more to follow leaving room for improvement.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
522,Redman13,Meh,4,22 September 2012,"A really cool concept with lots of awesome weapons. Unfortunately, the plot line is poor and much of the acting is mediocre. Even the good actors are hard pressed to deliver with OK dialogue and cheesy set-ups. This film reminds me of the Step Up movies; great primary theme, but they fall short in all other categories.The past stories of many of the main character's are told with flashbacks. These seamed poorly placed and the flashbacks seemed like they had been put in at the last second to try and provide background and fill time.All-in-all, I am glad I did not pay to see this movie. It was just barely worth the 117 minutes of my life to watch it.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
523,ogi81,One Of The Worst Movies Ever!!!!,1,22 April 2012,"One of the worst movies I have ever watched. Simply awful, dumb and outrageously bad movie. Waste of time. Makes me think why anyone would produce such a ""masterpiece"". Don't waste you time watching this movie. Film industry should stop making such bad movies. There is nothing good about this movie, except few good acting scenes. I can't believe that such a movie is being produced. I can't believe they're showing such movies in the movie theater. Please watch iron man or something similar. What a fun spoiler. Some people may like the special effects, but this is far and I really mean far from a movie that you would sit down for two hours and watch.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
524,wahha,Didn't they ever see GI Joe when they were younger?,3,9 November 2009,"Did this guy not ever watch GI Joe when he was younger. I just watched the film on DVD and it was complete crap. There wasn't even some of the main Joes in there, and they put ones in there that aren't very relevant(Ripcord, Breaker). Then the whole thing about Duke, Baroness, Ripcord, and Cobra all knowing each other before what happened was stupid. Then the whole Ripcord and Scarlett romance, complete crap. Scarlett is Snake Eyes women. This guy completely made a classic crap. I have no respect for this director anymore. It just made me so upset, that they would even go along with this story. The acting was good, no problem with the cast. The writers and the director had no clue what they were doing or knew nothing about GI Joe. Do your research before you make a film!",G.I.

525,Enigmatic-Ocean,Plain and simple... it's trash!,1,8 August 2009,"This is the typical CGI infested tripe that(unfortunately) seems to be all that Hollyweird can turn out these days. Ignore all of the studio plant reviews on IMDb. You'll know them by their abundance of absurd titles. Some of which sound like the following: ""Summer Popcorn Fun!"", ""Full Action Adrenaline Rush!"" and ""Crazy Chaos Inducing Thrill Ride!"". Botton line- if you want your intelligence insulted- see this movie. If you have zero depth and zero ability to hold a rational thought in you head (for less than a tenth of a second) go see this movie. This movie makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" seem like an Oscar contender! It makes ""Gigli"" look like ""Lawrence Of Arabia""! Flat dialog, bad acting, terrible looking CGI and a plot that... well, was there even a plot? I don't know.

I'm guessing that one of those people got upset that it wasn't good enough for a summer cable 11 pm time slot on Saturday night. So they went with a movie. This was their effort. Often, when I go into a movie with low expectations I come out pleasantly surprised and have enjoyed myself. This movie I had extremely low expectations. It's almost hard to remember one much worse. Any Katharine Heigl movie not named knocked up is the closest thing. Maybe I watched a different version of GI Joe than some other people. The one I watched had a bunch of bad actors, some surprisingly good actors(not here of course) and a writing team who recently learned English. ""Release the sharks!"" says Dennis Quaid.

I enjoyed this movie... that's it.... who the hell expects a movie like this to have an amazing plot????.... the director don't care, all they care is about pure adrenaline action.... watch expendables 2... would not be surprise to see a comment saying ""far too much explosions and shooting""... man some people are really ****ed up.... but all i can say and i say it out loud is I HATE PAID JOURNALISM.

It is so badly acted and indeed directed that it makes the telly tubbies seem palpable and real. The script is poor and blatantly written by someone who gives the sense of 'I have a rich daddy'. It is just poor! That said, the CGI is pretty strong, obvious, but quite well executed. Fair enough it has the obvious Hollywood formula that pre-empts a CG shot, but the execution is good. I find it hard to pinpoint the issues i have with 'Hollywood' action films. They seem to be lacking in emotion but heightened in stupid.

And the worse thing is, is that I loved G.I.Jo as a kid and really waited to see this movie. It's really strange cause there are some decent actors in this cast, but fact that everyone is either a bad guy or a good guy and the Jo's act like a bunch of rednecks. I have to admit that it's a bit pathetic. to be honest, I'm not sure how and even why I watched all of it, but do yourself a favor and skip this one.

It ignores much of what was established in the old cartoon series...but so what? If you're gonna base your objections to this on a CARTOON, then maybe you should go back to comic books. You need to use a lot of suspension from reality in this, but then again what movie don't you these days. It's a lot of fun, it gives the beginnings of Cobra Commander and Destro, shows how Duke joined up, and has a lot of explosions. It's just a lot of fun...but don't think too hard about it!",G.I.

533,onlyihavethisname,worst movie ever made,1,19 August 2009,"well, i went into the cinema with no expectations about the movie, having never played with the toys as a kid, not really seen any of the trailers or hype, and not read any of the reviews about it. To be honest, the only reason i even went to see it is because i had already seen time travellers wife. i was not disappointed, i had no expectations and left the cinema after 2 hours wondering what on earth i had just been watching. to anyone thinking about paying to see this movie, save your money, buy a brightly coloured tin of paint, and a brush, and watch that dry instead. it will be more entertaining, i promise, and you will have a newly painted wall to show for the effort too.OK, so lets diagnose the movie. the beginning starts out o.k. but.. hang on... the beginning seems to be the same as the middle.. and the end.. in fact, the entire movie is essentially just an especially long sequence of fancy effects sequences.so, it begins and some cool suited people beam down and steal some warheads or something, and some other cool suited people come and try to stop them but fail. there is lots of shooting and explosions and fancy aeroplanes.then, they all go off to some big base and talk about the stolen weapons for a few minutes, and then there is more shooting and explosions and cool vehicles.then, they go off to Paris, apparently going after the warheads or something and there is more cool suits and shooting and aeroplanes, and you get the picture.oh yeah, then, at the end, one of the guys turns to metal for some reason.ultimately, the problem with this movie is that its the sort of movie you would get if you asked a 5 year old to script and direct it. its similar to transformers, x-men, iron man etc except with the main protagonists being entirely uninteresting characters with no discernible personality traits other than being ""good guy"" or ""bad guy"".The acting and story are about as plastic as the toys the movie is based on.",G.I.

534,ausfan444,"This is 'Team America' re-imagined, and subsequently the world's most over the top movie yet produced...",2,6 August 2009,"This movie blew me away... as a veteran of over the top, 'so bad it's good' movies, I thought that I'd seen Hollywood take things way to far on special effects budgets, and invest about 2 cents worth of script, dialogue and believable characters enough to think that they could not possibly make a movie that could so categorically take all of those movies, combine their overall badness and then throw it into a particle accelerator till it broke through the walls of possibility, and came back to Earth as this. This, monster of a movie. Michael Bay has shown this generation the way, this is his legacy on Hollywood film makers of the future.To summarise this movie, its essentially Team America, but taking itself seriously. In fact, the first scene of Team America destroying Paris is essentially recreated, down to the last street mime. America saves the world, by blowing it up, with no shortage of cartoon characters and enough nationalities covered to almost look like the UN security council gone wild. The first scene of the movie may be almost a warning as to what this movie would bring, outrageous accents and over the top dramatic violence. No plot twist isn't foreseeable about 2 hours before it happens, everything has no real point, no stereotype goes unused. I will give it its due visually, its great special effects. But yeah, it seems every single shot, something is happening for no reason, every character seems a bit ridiculous (especially costumes), and so many well known actors were used, for really no good reason. Why the hell was Brandon Fraser in this movie, with Arnold Vosloo there it felt like 'The Mummy' on a 1,000,000 cc's of 'Roids.I thought Transformers 2 was the most over the top movie I was going to see for a long time, and then I saw this. This, has passed 'so bad its good', this has gone past so bad, its terrible, and the only thing good about it is the sheer talent it would have required to make something so bad, so comically, terribly bad and have the strength and tenacity to finish creating it, and STILL take itself so seriously. Yet, for all that, I enjoyed it, I enjoyed how much of a dick this movie was, and that's why it gets a second star. Go watch this movie, you will see the most terrible thing Hollywood has yet delivered from her twisted birth canals. Let's all prey this movie remains the most over the top yet, because I cannot for the life of me, work out how it could have been any more over the top. Writers Stuart Beattie and David Elliot, they've done good movies, they have no excuse, please, please, stop this trend before anything decent left in Hollywood is killed in this wave of excessiveness.

That's basically what it is, except with a bigger budget.If you're a fan of the 1980's GIJOE Marvel comics and/or the cartoons made by Sunbow, you're probably better served watching Cartoon Network's GIJOE Resolute again, or checking it out for the first time if you've never seen it.Rise of COBRA bears only minimal resemblance to the aforementioned source material. Imagine a Batman movie in which Bruce Wayne is a telekinetic paraplegic who dresses up like Marilyn Monroe to fight crime and battles the Joker who is a giant six-armed robot that speaks French.

Being able to see the characters that I had grown to love come to life was great. I thought the highlight of the film was definitely Sienna Miller playing the Baroness.

I had heard all of the negative hype attached to this movie, so I had already planned on not paying to see it. But, I decided that a free movie is a free movie, so even a bad free movie is worth it. Boy was I in for a surprise. The movie was good. Worth paying to see good. I grew up in the 80's and grew up with G.I. Joe and the Transformers. I enjoyed this movie more than both Transformer movies. There was plenty of action, a good story, and plenty of eye candy. A quick comment on the action: Yes there is a ton of CGI and explosions, but it's easier to follow than other recent action flicks (Transformers: The Rise of the Fallen). The only downsides to this movie would be the times that the actors try to be ""serious"", the sometimes cheesy dialog/jokes, and for the hardcore Joe fans, the liberties taken with the story. I didn't mind any of the liberties taken with the old, cartoon/comic book plots and I think looking past those allowed me to enjoy the movie a lot more. The crowd seemed to really like the movie and even applauded it. This was a sneak preview crowd full of ROTC members, the press, and G.I. Joe nerds, so I think that's a pretty good mix. In closing to parents, lots of violence and just a little blood; but I wouldn't say it was any worse than recent superhero movies.

The writing was awful, the special effects looked lame & the acting...don't get me started. The worst in the movie was Marlon Wayans and this has to be Dennis Quaid's worst performance (aside from his awful turn as Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp). Everyone seemed so wooden. I actually busted out laughing when Cobra Commander comes on the screen. The only thing worth watching was Sienna Miller.Spoilers: * Why make the Baroness be under influence of a mind control device. She is supposed to be with Destro and according to the comics ends up joining with Major Blood to try and take control of Cobra from CC. She was never good. As far as I know she was never with Duke. Lame storyline * You don't see Destro's mask or Cobra Commander's until the end of the movie and it's not worth the wait.

The acting is pretty bad, the story line is rather cheesy but the special effects are just fantastic and make the movie worth to watch! It is a simple bad-guys-want to destroy-and-rule-the-world scenario. Chris Ecclestone is one of the finer actors, and since I will always see him as Doctor Who, I got to say it's nice to see him in another role.

I don't mind Channing Tatum, but I think there were better choices for Duke. I was initially apprehensive about Marlon Wayans as Ripcord, but he does well as an action hero here. Granted he was brought in as the comic relief, but he never EVER resorted to anything so cringeworthy as Jar Jar Binks or Wheelie the leg-humper from Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen.Being from Chicago, I'm kind of miffed that they took TWO GI Joes, Cover Girl and Heavy Duty and changed their Chicago origins to being from Czech Republic and the U.K. And then switcheroo...the Baroness is NOT a foreigner, she's American. No hot Euro-trash accent! At least she's still a hot brunette in tight leather with her trademark eyewear.I'm not saying anything new about Ray Park's Snake Eyes. There's nobody else that could have pulled off such a physically demanding role. I'm hoping Lee Byung Hun has a bright future in Hollywood, he reminds me of a younger Chow Yun Fat. Joseph Gordon Levitt is a treat in a rare popcorn movie/blockbuster appearance, he brings evil into the role of Cobra Commander, who most remember as the cartoonish cowardly villain.Overall, a great last summer action blockbuster that doesn't take itself too seriously.",G.I.

Cast was strong but like mentioned earlier the characters were very weak. Portrayal of animosity and romance was fairly platonic. The villains were great escape artists and the hero's were good seekers. Almost the entire movie was a prolonged hide and seek game and GPS was almost always used to locate the enemy.

I have one reply to that: GET A LIVE! Bumble bee's a camaro, wolverine isn't wearing yellow spandex and in this movie cobra commander isn't wearing a blue ku clux clan-like hood...what a shock! I found that this movie has a lot of trouble trying to be anything else than a movie about G.I. Joe. So guys (and 1 girl) quit your whining..In my opinion they couldn't have made this movie that much better. to me this was like a warm nostalgic bath caked in beautiful visual eye candy. I might not have been expecting to much, but I was truly surprised in a good sense. I wasn't blown away.. at least not in an emotional sense... I was in an audio-visual sense though (like transformers 2 on steroids in that department). This movie was a lot like what i had imagined g.i. joe could be like if made in live action.I'm happy to be part of the generation that grew up with the likes of gi-joe and transformers and to have faithful life action movies made out of them.. I mean would you rather have been part of the generation that had to grow up with tripe like power rangers and pokemon? And see the resulting god-awful sh*t they put in the theaters? To me (like the probability of a sequel) is a no-brainer.In the end i am very pleased with this movie and very much looking forward to the sequel.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
545,melunna,What a waste of time!,1,8 August 2009,"I hadn't really thought about seeing this movie, until a bunch of cousins took me along. I didn't know too much about GI Joe in general, so I was fairly optimistic about it. Wrong! This movie is like 90% cgi special effects. It could have existed without actors in it. There were no characters developments, and the lines were cheesy, and the plot was wayyy too predictable. Some scenes were so random and unnecessary. I can appreciate the fact the special effects were pretty decent at some parts, but overall, I would never see this movie again, and regret seeing it the first time. In fact it was so bad at some points, I just burst out in laughter because it was amusing to me to think that a movie this terrible could have been conceived. If i were you, don't see this, especially if you're an action movie fan, because this just insults all the great movies in this genre. If u must, rent it when it comes out on DVD.",G.I.

546,brycec,All We Need is VENGIL,8,7 August 2009,"Just got back from the movie, and I thought I'd get my review out there sooner rather than later--especially since they didn't allow the movie to screen for many critics, so there might be a good chance some of you out there are debating whether or not to go see GI Joe this weekend. Allow me to answer your question.Go Joe! (Sorry, couldn't resist.) Look--it should come as a huge surprise to any of you that this movie is not high brow cinema. It's based on a line of toy aimed at 10 year old boys. But as far as movies go that are aimed at making me feel like a 10 year old boy again, this one was pretty near perfect. It's got anything and everything you could ask for: violence, explosions, ninjas, and girls in leather. I mean, just about anything is better with violence, explosions, ninjas, and girls in leather (VENGIL from now on), right? I mean, think about it. Take Fried Green Tomatoes, and add a good dose of VENGIL. Voila! A movie any American boy would love. The Notebook? Just add VENGIL, and watch the magic happen. Beaches is dying for some VENGIL. So is pretty much any movie with Hugh Grant.(Please note: I think this goes without saying, but if you don't like VENGIL, you won't like this movie.) GI Joe is over the top. There are explosions around every corner. The laws of physics do not apply to this movie. Neither do plots that can't be solved with gratuitous VENGIL. How was the acting? Well, Marlon Wayans wasn't entirely annoying 100% of the time. It made me feel like I was watching a cartoon. So--mission accomplished.I think I might go see it again. :-) Dear Mr. Michael Bay: please take notes for how to do an 80s cartoon adaptation. This movie blew Transformers out of the water. Stephen Sommers (the guy who actually made a watchable Huck Finn movie--I'm speaking as an expert here, folks)--I salute you! All that kept this movie back from GI Joe perfection was the lack of the theme song.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
547,CaptainStevenHiller,I loved G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra! Best movie of the summer!,10,11 August 2009,"As a fan of some cheesy movies, (take my user name for example which is from Will Smith's character in Independence Day) I absolutely loved the new G.I. Joe live action film.I understand that many fans don't like some of the changes such as the costumes, the action and the somewhat silly storyline, with that being said, I think it's quite similar to the film Independence Day. Both films are popcorn crowd pleasers filled with cheesy lines, non stop action, and enjoyable people.I really loved watching Ripcord as he reminded me of Captain Hiller, with his wisecracking jokes, and his ability to fly cool planes.I also liked Duke, Snake Eyes, and Destro. In fact, all of the characters were really cool to watch.I didn't like Cobra Commander, but, that's just one minor complaint.G.I. Joe Rise of Cobra is easily my favorite movie of the summer! Yo Joe!",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
548,turkus2,Why take it seriously?,2,8 August 2009,"What I liked about the first Transformers movie was that it didn't take itself too seriously. It sort of new it was about babes, explosions, and cars that transform into things that shoot other things. I didn't like the second Transformers movie because it was epic-length and tried to take itself seriously.I think I can respect it a bit more now.GI Joe... are you ready? GI Joe is one of the worst movies since Ernest Scared Stoopid. And I was at least young enough to enjoy that.This is not only some of the worst dialog I've ever seen in my life, but its delivered with all the grace and wit of a truck driver ballet dancing. Honestly, WHEN you leave this movie early (and you will), you'll wonder why they tried to set up a story. And I do mean ""set up."" There are more flashback sequences in this film than there are actors. And none of the characters is interesting or different enough to be considered worth remembering - save two. Sienna Miller and Ray Park's characters could have been pulled out of this movie and stuck into another one and would have been enjoyable (Ray Park was enjoyable because, as always, he never talks). But as it stands their characters and efforts were surrounded by some of the worst acting this side of a middle school musical. At least in the musical you have a child who is enjoying themselves. It would seem the only proud parents at the screenings of GI Joe would be the producers, who will make money on this film because of the women and the effects.I don't hate this film, I love it. I love it because its bad and it reminds us that movies ARE difficult to make and if you don't take them seriously, you could end up like this. We need bad movies, they remind us that not every professional knows what he's doing.So please, go watch GI Joe. You'll feel a hell of a lot better about yourself.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
549,kursum1,Fun but silly movie,4,14 April 2010,"This is movie was fun to watch. just leave you brain in the shades and watch the movie. It's action pack but take it as it is, if you think about it too much you will laugh. There is some very high technology in the movies. there's lot of action, heroes, love stories etc. Typical Hollywood flick. Visually the movie is great, but the story is lacking.Acting is mediocre, casting could be better. All those money spend on visual effect wold be better spent on script and casting. The movies is pretty enjoyable, it kinda feels like kids have made the movie, but if you got 2 hours to spend this movie will get you through those two hours without boring you too much.I just hope they won't make sequel of this.",G.I. Joe - The Rise of Cobra
