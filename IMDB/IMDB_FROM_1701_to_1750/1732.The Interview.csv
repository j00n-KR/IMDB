0,SnoopyStyle,some hilarity but not as funny as I hoped,6,8 June 2015,"Dave Skylark (James Franco) is a celebrity interviewer with his tabloid TV show ""Skylark Tonight"" run by producer Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen). World tension is rising as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un (Randall Park) test missiles that can hit the American west coast. The Times reports that he's a fan of Skylark Tonight and Dave wants to do an interview. CIA Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) recruits them to assassinate him. Seth Rogen as straight man isn't as funny as his usual self. James Franco is funny as a stupid idiot. Diana Bang has some funny moments. The movie has some hilarious moments but it is not as densely packed with comedy as I hoped.",The Interview
1,nogodnomasters,THEY HATE US CAUSE THEY AIN'T US,8,17 April 2018,"While hiking in North Korea, I stopped at my favorite watering hole, ""Kimchi and Chow"" (don't eat the Shepherd's Pie) and sure enough they had playing on loop, ""The Interview."" My two favorite bros where there, Kim, and Dennis. We did some shooters, toasted life, and kicked back and enjoyed the film.I think everyone knows the basic plot. The opening singing would of had been funny, but reminded too much of real songs done in Germany as performed in ""The Book Thief."" I went into the film wanting to write a negative review so I could tongue-in-cheek praise Kim Jung-Un for trying to save us from another James Franco film. However the first interview with Eminem had me in stitches.It only takes 35 minutes for our guys to get to North Korea. Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen) wants to go there because there are ""a lot of Asian girls there."" Dave Skylark (James Franco) who does the interview, is not a serious journalist, but is a favorite of Kim.There are lots of pop culture and movie references. LOTR is prevalent. There was a line from ""Hitchhiker's Guide..."" and of course where would the world be without the deep songs of Katy Perry. The film also has a diverse sound track and swagger music. I couldn't help but notice the use of Isaac Hayes' cover, ""Walk on By.""The beginning of the film was sharp and was good up until the actual interview when the production turned into slap stick. I understand they rewrote and redid the ending which may have caused this. Hopefully the DVD will have an alternative ending.Guide: Plenty of F-bombs. Brief sex scene. Brief nudity.",The Interview
2,kosmasp,Best/worst Interview ever,8,9 June 2015,"People seem to like to go to extremes and it's normal. If you really like something you'll go completely out of line to express your emotions and feelings for what you loved. Same things goes for those who hated this movie. Obviously the hack and the bomb threats made this a desirable watch, maybe even by people who wouldn't have looked at this otherwise.But to reduce the movie to that would be unfair and also derive you from the fun you could have with it. Comedy is always in the eye of the beholder and this will not be everyones cup of tea. But if you let yourself into this world (apparently all ""characters"" in this are fictitious), you can have fun with Franco and Rogen going at it.Throw in a bit of ""Total Recall"" (some would call it foreshadowing) and other things our main guys like and you get either a hilarious result or something very boring and annoying, depending on which ""side"" you're on. ""Beware"" of the language used and some graphic violence (used for laughs of course mostly).",The Interview
3,Sleepin_Dragon,"It may have been controversial, but it sucks.",3,17 February 2018,"Why on Earth does this have such a positive rating here, after all the hype and the myriad of controversy I was expecting something edgy and bold, instead we were treated to a film which makes Epic Movie look full of original jokes. I can't even say it's in bad taste, it's just bad, I imagine that the positive score comes from the controversy which dogged the film. Rogan isn't bad, he plays the usual character which you'd expect from him, I am a fan of his, he's ok, but the rest of the movie sucks. Stupid, unfunny, lacking any true humour, it's just brash, infantile, the kind of script you can imagine two idiots came up with after drinking too much. A real shame, I had high hopes.",The Interview
4,gavin6942,Forget That OakTree,7,30 January 2015,"Dave Skylark (James Franco) and producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) run the celebrity tabloid show ""Skylark Tonight."" When they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, they are recruited by the CIA to turn their trip to Pyongyang into an assassination mission.Once upon a time, the great Judd Apatow had a show called ""Freaks and Geeks"". Sadly, it was overlooked in its day and only achieved a cult following later. But from that came the friendship of Franco and Rogen, which has made some great comedies. And this one.Is it stupid? Yes. Is it childish? Yes. But is it funny? Actually, yes. Franco is so bizarre, he really nails this. He may be known for his odd, artistic stuff, but his comedy is genius in its own way.But the question no one seems to be asking is, is this ethically okay? Apparently joking about murdering the leader of North Korea is okay. And yet, if another country (any country at all) made a film about assassinating a sitting president, would we not get up in arms? (Don't get me wrong. I'm all about free expression... just curious if we're allowing a double standard to slide in the name of patriotism.)",The Interview
5,Quinoa1984,the punk rock comedy of the year,9,28 December 2014,"When it comes to comedy and satire, it's all about taste. A couple of Mel Brooks quotes come to mind, one is his description of how he approaches humor - ""My movies rise below vulgarity"" - as well as the difference between comedy and drama - ""I cut my finger that's a tragedy, someone falls down a manhole cover, that's comedy."" The Interview is presented as a howler, a scream, a laugh riot, an uncouth satire on not simply Kim Jong-Un, which is the natural assumption given the rabid media attention due to the whole hacking-of-a-corporation and then cancellation-of-release-turned-around-to-quasi-theatrical-VOD release. It pokes fun at celebrity culture, shallow interviewers, and not just obvious ones (Eminem, Rob Lowe's hair-piece), but at the outrageousness of an image. It's very vulgar at times - if you don't find jokes that involve hiding small devices from the CIA up a butt funny, then perhaps that's that - and very violent as well. But, for me, the movie rises below vulgarity, so to speak, by how Rogen and Goldberg and company go about the subject matter.Take the Big Kahuna himself, Kim Jong-Un. The filmmakers could simply put him up as the 'Dictator of the Moment' as the subject of mockery - this, one could argue, is pretty much what Parker and Stone did with the funny but more scatter-shot Team America: World Police, which targeted the late father Jong-Il. Instead, as played with hilarity and and levels of (yes) depth by Randall Park, there's something of a crazy man-child to this character, maybe even a distinct parody by the same filmmakers who have been in that story-pool for years (Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, Funny People, This is the End, and elsewhere with the likes of Will Ferrell comedies). He is terrifying, and also by turns pathetic, amusing, wild (see all his ladies and tanks left over from Stalin days - sorry, wrong pronunciation, it's 'Stallone'), and maybe latently (or full-on) homosexual with his fixation on Katy Perry music.In other words, the filmmakers make this subject work because they commit completely to the mockery of it all, the bald-faced f***-you to such a dictator by not making him completely in-human - as a simple murderous monster it would be too easy - but with someone who has, hell to say it, a soul of a sort. And yet this isn't all the movie has, no way. It's a delirious, awesome showcase for Rogen and Franco as a comedy pair, with Franco as the over-the-top guy who will say things too far in a conversation as celeb-show host Dave Skylark, and Rogen as his producer. The set up is pretty straightforward: in the midst of being in their tenth year on a show, as Rogen's Aaron is un-happy with the direction of the program as celeb-fluff, he finds out that the NK dictator is a major fan, reaches out, and after a bizarre meet-up (they couldn't just call of course) set up the interview, and then the CIA come with their own plot to 'take him out'.If you don't find Franco and Rogen funny - or especially Franco who is going to town as a wild man-boy-dog-lover and threatens to steal the show from Rogen, who is and isn't the 'straight man' of these two knuckleheads - you may have difficulty getting into the flick. Right away with that Eminem scene, you'll know what you're getting into, and from there it's wall-to-wall comedy, with the occasional semi-predictable story turn. It's by turns goofy and sincere, but only sincere to its anarchic vision. And yet the filmmakers take some smart, funny chances in little things: there's a female character who comes into a major way in the story, and ends up becoming a real bad-ass character. There's no big deal of making light that it's a woman doing this - and, naturally, maybe too naturally (or just hilariously I guess) she becomes a romantic interest for Rogen - she just is.Did I mention the movie has a lot of violence? Good God. The influence from Tarantino can't be understated, and the filmmakers run with it here as well; just when you think a scene gets splatter-ific, or something happens that is just 'WHOA!', it becomes all the funnier just by how the other characters react to it. Again, the 'falling in the manhole' principle via Brooks. Watching someone, for example, getting an appendage ripped off in a gnarly way isn't funny, but the reactions to it are. Or, for that matter, how a dictator meets his ultimate demise (I wish I could say this is a spoiler, but really the internet did that for me already).It all comes together, ultimately, in what is both very smart and very stupid, or rather The Interview is very smart about being stupid, if that makes sense, and certainly not the other way around. Opinions may vary on how little or how much the movie's improv comedy lines (get ready for a lot of Lord of the Rings references, for me all spot-on and clever) and cartoonish violence and excess, but it's hard to say they weren't trying to didn't go balls-out, so to speak. And, yeah, see it to be a 'Free American' or about Free Speech or whatever. But the fact is, it'd still be a funny, incendiary, deranged and, at times, kind of adorable movie if there wasn't a bit of hoopla over it.",The Interview
6,tavm,The Interview is as outrageous as one expects it to be,7,4 October 2015,"After all the hubbub about the release-no release of this movie due to threats from North Korea, I finally watched this movie with my mom on Netflix disc. It's pretty outrageous which shouldn't surprise any fan of James Franco and Seth Rogen whenever they appear together. Yes, there is an attempted assassination on the dictator of that country I just mentioned. But while there's some plenty of action scenes and some drama concerning the fate of some characters, it's mostly quite funny in a raunchy way among many shocks that occur into the narrative. And Randall Park does a fine portrayal doing his version of Kim Jong-un. Oh, and yes, one of the female members of the dictator's cabinet turns out...oh, watch the movie to find out. So that's a recommendation of The Interview.",The Interview
7,sunwarrior13,Controversial Political Comedy,7,28 December 2014,"The Interview is a political comedy that stars Seth Rogen and James Franco.The movie is about two American journalists that booked an interview North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and were instructed by the CIA to assassinate him as well.Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg directed it.Too bad that Dan Sterling's screenplay irked the North Korean leader himself as King Jong-un made threats and warnings against the United States if the producers pushed through with its release.That is why interest in the film is probably high especially for moviegoers who would want to get into the detail of the controversy.Dave Skylark and his producer Aaron Rapoport are involved with a celebrity TV show known as ""Skylark Tonight"". They later discover that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is a fan of the show.They managed to get an interview with him.But as they go to North Korea,their plans change when the CIA recruits them to kill the North Korean leader.They do it by a fast-acting poison that can be transferred via handshake.The real Kim Jong-un got really mad about this film for he was obviously offended!!!!!As I was writing this review,he now blames President Barack Obama to be partly responsible for the film.Clearly,he does not understand that it an abuse of the exercise of freedom of expression on the part of the film's producers.No question that the movie is in poor taste.The events of the screenplay is impossible.It is stupid.No question that the filmmakers could have used a fictional dictator in a fictional country instead of using the name of a the North Korean leader.They probably want to promote themselves as pro-democracy and anti- dictatorship.No doubt that that was far from the truth considering that one with enough common sense would have already known that using the identity of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was part of the movie's selling point to attract moviegoers into watching this film knowing the conflict between the United States and North Korea.Too bad that they themselves were partly responsible for the controversy it involved for it was offensive and done in poor taste.Nevertheless,I enjoyed the performances of James Franco and Seth Rogen in the film as well as the other supporting cast particularly Lizzy Caplan.There are many scenes that provided lots of laughter despite the fact that they it was humor was blunt,offensive and raunchy.Too bad that the producers did not trust the abilities of the cast into selling a movie to the public by using a fictional dictator and fictional country instead of an actual leader of a country.",The Interview
8,zardoz-13,"Not As Hilarious as ""Team America: World Police""",5,28 December 2014,"An asinine comedy of errors about two clueless clowns who gallivant off to North Korea to assassinate tyrannical dictator Kim Jong-un, co-directors Evan Goldberg & Seth Rogen's ""The Interview"" qualifies as lowest common denominator mockery masquerading as an exposé that relies heavily on R-rated sexual innuendo gags ad nauseam and gratuitous violence to fuel its farce. Despite its flawless technical expertise and polished production values, this ribald Sony Pictures' release, which some argue prompted corporate hacking on a scale heretofore unknown, is neither half as hilarious as the last Seth Rogen & James Franco apocalyptic epic ""This Is the End"" (2013) nor as repugnant as Trey Parker's marionette melodrama ""Team America: World Police"" (2004) that ridiculed Kim's father Kim Jong-il. Depending on your state of maturity, not to mention your sense of humor, Goldberg & Rogen's sophomoric shenanigans with their infantile antics may keep you in stitches or repulse you as cinematically atrocious. Everybody knows the best way to get somebody to do something that they are dead set against doing but you want them to do is to deny them the opportunity to do it. Whether the barbarians who hacked Sony realized it, the events surrounding the hacking and the presumed object of the hacking—this amusing but addle-pated opus—may have done more to whet public appetite for it than had the film been released without the controversial fanfare. First Amendment rights and anti-North Korean sentiment aside, ""The Interview"" proves once again that negative public relations can be as useful as positive public relations. We all know Sony refused to release the comedy after the terrorist group Guardians of Peace threatened them with retaliation and later theater chains balked at screening it in the wake of those threats. Since then Sony has changed its corporate mind and unspooled ""The Interview"" for limited release in 331 theaters. I saw this rude and crude film at YouTube, and I can assure you that you're not missing anything sensational. Judging by news reports in the media, ""The Interview"" may already qualify as the most pirated movie in film history. Reportedly, the film will not tour the Asian theater circuit, but reports indicate that over a million and a half copies of ""The Interview"" have been pirated thus far owing to both its own notoriety as well as Kim's outrage over it.Grandiose tabloid talk show host Dave Skylark (James Franco of ""Pineapple Express"") and his producer pal Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up"") spotlight celebrities on their show ""Skylark Tonight."" Appearing as a guest, actor Rob Lowe reveals he is hideously hairless. Later, rapper Eminem reveals he has been hiding his homosexuality behind his own strongly suggestive song lyrics. Scoops like these have yielded high ratings for ""Skylark Tonight."" Eventually, Skylark throws a surprise party for Rapaport after they broadcast their one-thousandth episode. Everybody joins in celebration, and a ""60 Minutes"" producer says that CBS is searching for a producer with Rapaport's savvy. Indeed, Rapaport craves respectability, something ""Skylark Tonight"" denies him as a serious journalist. Nevertheless, before he jumps ship for ""60 Minutes,"" Rapaport gets a phone call from Kim Jong-un's liaison, Sook (Diane Bang of TV's ""Bates Motel""), that the thirtysomething dictator wants Dave to interview him on ""Skylark Tonight."" Rapaport flies to China to chat with Kim's people. The catch is Kim has prepared a script with questions. Naturally, despite any restrictions that Kim has imposed on them, Dave cannot wait to interview the dictator. The C.I.A. makes contact with our hare-brained heroes about their proposed trip. Seductive Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan of ""Cloverfield"") display lots of cleavage for Dave and persuades them to assassinate Kim. All this resembles something the C.I.A. probably tried to do with the Castro regime in the 1960s. Dave is supposed to administer ricin poison to Kim when he shakes hands with the dictator. A transdermal strip attached to the palm of Dave's hand will pass along the poison that will kill Kim.Of course, Dave doesn't follow C.I.A. procedure. He smuggles the ricin into North Korea disguised as chewing gum. No sooner have they deplaned than North Korean security guards frisk them. One appropriates Dave's ricin-flavored gum and chews it. The next day he suffers from a seizure and dies. Agent Lacey flies in two additional strips on a drone flown by a teenager gamer at Nellis AFB in Nevada. Plunging into the North Korean wilderness, Rapaport scrambles to retrieve the capsule. Narrowly, he avoids getting eaten by a ravenous tiger, but suddenly learns that the North Koreans are closing in on his location. Desperately, Rapaport crams the enormous capsule—about the size of a large flashlight—up his anus. Miraculously, Rapaport evades capture and is simply escorted back to his motel. Meanwhile, Dave shares bro-time with Kim (Randall Park of ""Neighbors""), and the TV talk show host finds himself bonding with him. Tooling around in a tank, they fire several rounds. Afterward, they abuse liquor and narcotics with Kim's harem of sexy girls, and Kim even gives Dave an adorable puppy. In fact, Kim pulls the wool over Dave's eyes. Repeatedly, Rapaport warns Dave that Kim has 'honeydicked' him, and he accuses C.I.A. of pulling the same stunt on them. By this time, Dave refuses to kill Kim. After sharing these daddy issues with each other, he believes everything Kim has told him. Only after he conducts his own eleventh hour investigation does Dave realize he's been duped.Our heroes succeed in ridiculing Kim, and he threatens to unleash his doomsday arsenal of nuclear missiles. Little about ""The Interview"" is believable. Certainly, no dictator would be idiotic enough to consent to a 'live' broadcast. Rapaport could not insert a capsule as large as he does without injury. Indeed, journalists as foolish as Dave and Rapaport might gain access to Kim, but they would be kept under constant surveillance. Altogether, ""The Interview"" amounts to a goofy, low-brow, bromantic comedy with an explosive James Bond finale.",The Interview
9,grantss,Quite silly,3,19 October 2015,"Quite silly.An American talk show host and his producer manage to get an interview with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. As they are about to head for North Korea, the CIA approach them with a plan for them to assassinate The Dear Leader...Has a few good comedic moments, mostly in the first few scenes, but mostly very stupid and silly. Vastly over-hyped due to North Korean threats of retribution and Sony's resulting reaction in delaying the release of the movie. Beyond the hype, over-the-top plot (which borders on propaganda) and inevitable controversy and free publicity due to it, there is very little to this movie, including in the laughs department.The fact that it stars James Franco means you already know it is going to be pretty bad. On the plus side for him, he is in a role which suits him, as a superficial, pretentious moron, so he is basically playing himself. Shouldn't be too much of a stretch, even for him...The most entertaining performances come from those playing the North Koreans, especially Randall Park as Kim Jong-un and Diana Bang as Sook.",The Interview
10,oscaralbert,Katy Perry averts a Nuclear Holocaust . . .,7,5 January 2015,". . . by singing about a bag blowing in the wind. Paper or plastic? Does it really matter? This is a good example of the Butterfly Effect, in which a single wing-beat in China might cause a rippling cascade of displaced air molecules culminating in the visiting closer being blown off the rubber in the bottom of the ninth with the go-ahead runner on third in the seventh game of the World Series for a walk-off balk season championship (but trust me, that tiny winged creature never will be voted a diamond-encrusted golden ring, not that it will ever miss it). Speaking of China, that's where Aaron first meets Sook after climbing way up into the foothills immediately after a gratuitous scene of NON-historical smoking on an Asian bullet train. Perhaps that's the main point of THE INTERVIEW. Actor Seth Rogen as ""Aaron"" looks really winded when he initially encounters Sook. A few more puffs, and he may not have made it to the helicopter rendezvous coordinates in time. Perhaps writer\director\star Rogen is using his ""bully pulpit"" to illustrate that smoking and mountain climbing are a bad mix.",The Interview
11,Uriah43,Just Wasn't That Good,2,6 February 2015,"""Dave Skylark"" (James Franco) is a television tabloid journalist who just happens to have North Korean's President ""Kim Jong Un"" (Randall Park) as his number one fan. So Dave sends his agent and best friend ""Aaron Rapaport"" (Seth Rogen) to an isolated part of China to negotiate terms for an interview with him. Once the terms are accepted both Dave and Aaron head to North Korea where they find that things aren't always like they seem. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk ruining it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that if a person enjoys crass, low-class humor with plenty of references to bodily functions and sexual organs then this movie is definitely something for you. I personally thought there were a couple of funny scenes initially but that things went downhill after the first 30 minutes or so with just Diana Bang (as the North Korean producer named ""Sook"") and the cute puppy towards the end being the only things that were even remotely interesting. That said--while I certainly don't appreciate the manner in which the North Korean government tried to prevent this movie from being shown--I also have to say that this movie just wasn't that good. I have rated it accordingly.",The Interview
12,anaconda-40658,Interview Satire.,9,15 March 2016,"The Interview (2014): Dir: Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen / Cast: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Lizzy Caplan, Randall Park, Diana Bang: Highly controversial comedy about one's self examination. It stars James Franco as edgy talk show host Dave Skylark, and Seth Rogen as his producer and best friend Aaron Rapaport. After exposing Eminem's sexual orientation, and Rob Lowe's hair confession, they are given notice that Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is a fan and desires an audience with Skylark. Enter CIA agent Lacey, played by Lizzy Caplan who tasks the boys with assassinating the leader with a poison strip via handshake. All goes well upon arrival until Skylark accepts an invitation to hang out with Jong-un where their bonding has Skylark questioning whether this leader is really as bad as his reputation indicates. Rapaport struggles to help Skylark remain focused until more nifty plot turns surface. It is clear that after This is the End, Rogen and directing partner Evan Goldberg aim low in terms of humour, including scenes where fingers are bitten off during fight sequences. Both are well schooled in writing dialogue that presents characters as more human than the average formula outing. Franco as the flamboyant Skylark discovers his dreams crushed when realization sets in regarding his so-called new friend. Rogen is in top form trying to maintain order and Skylark. In supporting roles are Caplan as flustered agent Lacey. Randall Park is a steal as Jong-un who has a secret love for Katy Perry's Fireworks. Diana Bang plays a Korean contact with whom Rapaport is smitten. Daring comedy that aimed where no interview should go. Score: 9 / 10",The Interview
13,FlashCallahan,It's pronounced Stallone........,6,27 December 2014,"Dave Skylark and his producer Aaron Rapoport run the popular celebrity tabloid TV show ""Skylark Tonight."" When they discover that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is a fan of the show, they land an interview with him in an attempt to make rivals take them as serious journalists. As Dave and Aaron prepare to travel, their plans change when the CIA recruit them, to assassinate Kim Jong-un....In all seriousness, you have to put all the controversy, all the hacking jobs, and leaks that has shrouded this film into infamy and instant cult status, and put it aside and watch it for what it is, a high concept comedy, with a little bit of Spies Like Us thrown in.But I couldn't help it myself, and about halfway through the third act, the Public Enemy song 'Don't Believe The Hype' was playing on loop in the back of my head.It starts off okay, with a great cameo from Eminem, and the chemistry between Franco and Rogen is right there like it was with Pineapple Express, and the awful This Is The End.But then, it gets too silly too soon, and then it goes all serious for a time, and loses its pace, thus the finale feeling somewhat redundant.But for the most part, its a funny film, Franco really hitting the nail on the head when homaging second rate TV presenters who have nothing really to 'present', his air headedness is one of the highlights of the film.Rogen is Rogen, and despite his best efforts, here he has the same Shtick be bad in Knocked up, and I've given up hoping that he will act a little different in a movie, but hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.And regarding all the controversy, all I can say is Pfft, the opening ten minutes of The Naked Gun, has more material likely to offend, than this. Yes, he is portrayed as a weak, selfish, child like person, but there are scenes where he becomes slightly close to endearing, so it's all swings and roundabouts.All in all, its watchable stuff, but don't expect anything as controversial as you would have thought it to be. It's silly stuff, that loses its way toward the end.",The Interview
14,zetes,Pretty funny,7,31 December 2014,"Amongst all the hoopla, I feel like I was the only one who actually wanted to see this movie just because I thought it looked funny. I'm not embarrassed by this in the least - after all, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are responsible for several very good films, most notably Superbad, Pineapple Express and This Is the End. They've had some duds, too, like The Green Hornet, but I was hoping this one would land on the good side of their career. It does, though it's not quite as good as their best work. James Franco's performance is quite weird. His character is too goofy to be believable as a popular interviewer, even of pop culture. Rogen gives much the same performance as he does in any number of other films, but, frankly, I find him funny, so I liked him here. The plot is sloppy, but, hey, it's a lowbrow comedy, and when it's funny, it's often very funny. It has great fun in taking downKim Jong-Un (very well played by Randall Park). Diana Bang and Lizzy Caplan are both very good as the women of the picture.",The Interview
15,Sylviastel,Who Greenlighted This Film Deserves the Pink Slip?,2,31 October 2015,"What was Sony thinking about when they green lighted the script! Obviously somebody didn't do their research about North Korea. Couldn't somebody at Sony alerted the potential fallout over a silly comedy film. Maybe somebody at the United States State Department dissuade them from releasing it over a possible diplomatic fallout from this silly film. Obviously nobody at Sony had any inking or North Korea wouldn't have responded by hacking into Sony's emails in the first place. How come Sony didn't fictionalize a country without naming North Korea. Perhaps picking North Korea was intentional. Sony wouldn't know that Skylark and Rappaport wouldn't have been left alone. Their suite would have been bugged and they would have been escorted by minders everywhere. Except for Lizzy Caplan's performance, I found the film to be a difficult in viewing.",The Interview

For a comedy that last for almost two hours I might have smiled a couple of times but that was about it. I found James Franco simply annoying. Seth Rogan was OK but not much more then that, certainly not hilarious. The jokes were childish and I was actually glad when the movie finished. I don't get how people can give this movie a higher rating then six stars. I am being over generous giving it 6 stars. The story is also not great at all. I don't think I will ever watch it again. If you have really nothing else to do you can give it a go but honestly I would watch something else if I were you because there are much better comedies then this one.",The Interview

18,namashi_1,Some Wicked Fun!,7,25 December 2014,"Despite the doomed controversy surrounding it, 'The Interview' is a pretty cool & funny film, that deserved a wider release. Its limited release may restrict its appeal, but I'd suggest anyone who wants to laugh on Christmas, should check this one out. 'The Interview' Synopsis: Dave Skylark and producer Aaron Rapoport run the celebrity tabloid show ""Skylark Tonight."" When they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, they are recruited by the CIA to turn their trip to Pyongyang into an assassination mission.'The Interview' has its share of hiccups. Firstly, the concept itself, would raise eye-brows & the sequences involving the dictator, are quite shocking, even though its told in all good humor. One more thing, the excessive violence in the narrative puts off you. The bloodshed could've easily been calmer.But on the plus side, 'The Interview' is quite a joyride! Seth Rogen's Story, is nicely complimented by a mostly laugh-out-loud Screenplay Written by Dan Sterling. There are moments of pure hilarity, as well as moments involving shocking dialogue. Rogen & Evan Goldberg's Direction is perfect. Cinematography is awesome. Editing is rightly done. Art Design is excellent. Performance-Wise: Rogen is in very good form, delivering above expectations. James Franco is a complete riot. His over-the-top, loud performance as the self-obsessed TV-Anchor, brings the house down on numerous occasions. Lizzy Caplan is first-rate. Randall Park is another topper as the megalomaniac dictator. His scenes with Franco, are truly funny. Diana Bang is stupendous, she unknowingly steals the show!On the whole, 'The Interview' has moments of shock & gore, but there is also a lot of humor in here, that does the trick.",The Interview
19,StevePulaski,No sense crying over sterile satire,4,5 January 2015,"I have already given my opinion on the cancellation of the theatrical release for The Interview in my podcast ""The Front Row Steve Podcast,"" along with my thoughts on the Sony Pictures hack and what the future holds for this particular film. Therefore, this review is going to be just that - a review of the film and not an evaluation or summation of the enormous amount of press this film has garnered over the last few weeks. Everyone who has voiced their opinion on the theater chains' decision to opt out of showing The Interview in multiplexes like AMC and Regal has already voiced their opinion, myself included, and it's time to take a look at the film as a collective whole.The Interview concerns Dave Skylark (James Franco), the host of the popular entertainment talk show Skylark Tonight, who embraces the kind of TMZ-esque news coverage widely-believed to be the kind of news people want. Skylark would be nothing without his loyal sidekick and producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen), who has helped propel him to new heights and get him up to we're they are at now - their 1,000th episode spectacular. In the midst of a North Korean missile crisis that occurred earlier last year, Skylark realizes from an inside source that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un is actually a big fan of Skylark Tonight, and makes enough calls to try and secure and interview with him. The interview is eventually confirmed through Jong-Un's cabinet, and pretty soon, both Skylark and Aaron are off to interview one of the most controversial dictators of their time.Before they even leave, however, they are contacted by Agency Lacey (Lizzy Caplan), who informs the two that the CIA sees this mission as an opportunity to assassinate the North Korean leader; the plan would be for Skylark to shake Jong-Un's hand, leaving behind an odorless ricin on his hand that would eventually cause his body to shut down. It isn't until Skylark meets the Korean dictator (played by Randall Park) that he sees a man that may have been unfairly chastised and criticized by the media, while Aaron still wants to go through with the assassination plan, believing Kim Jong-Un is playing both of them for fools.Such a controversial plot and a daring jab to the side of a country which seems to be a fan of provoking international incidents would lead one to assume there is more to The Interview than the usual brand of Rogen schtick, but alas, there isn't much. Potential for satire and commentary on international affairs and America's involvement in them are squandered for a pathetic array of bathroom humor and tiresome banter discussing whether or not Kim Jong-Un actually goes to the bathroom or not. Blatant ethnocentrism runs rampant with the North Korean characters of the film, particularly Sook (Diana Bang), who works as one of North Korea's propagandists but doesn't become more than the butt of Korean jokes until Aaron has sex with her and realizes she can be of some use.The overall effect of The Interview is tiresome to say the least. At nearly two hours long, it would've been nice to gain some kind of perspective from the film, be it a satirical or informative one even in subtle undertones, but the writing/directing team of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg refuse to make the film anything more than a tired assembly of frat-boy humor, and not the witty kind. The film's more commendable aspects come from a clearly talented Randall Park, playing an often humorously overdrawn version of Kim Jong-Un to great effect despite the fact that the film surrounding the actor is often dreary and repetitive all the more.Starring: Seth Rogen, James Franco, Randall Park, and Lizzy Caplan. Directed by: Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg.",The Interview
20,KineticSeoul,Well it's amusing,6,7 January 2015,"They had potential to bring about something that meant something despite the comedic elements. But it falters in that department and I could see why some Koreans, especially people that escaped from North Korea would find this movie to be shameful. However in my opinion it's a controversial movie that still has to amuse certain audiences. James Franco is probably the only funny thing about this movie, but it's mainly because of his characters superficial stupidity. But really sells this movie is how they portrayed Kim Jong-un. Now I don't know how the guy is like in real life, but I got to admit it was stil amusing to watch. Some of the cameos has desperation written all over it although some may disagree. It's a shame that it couldn't bring out it's full potential with what is going on in North Korea and all, and the portrayal of the North Korean citizens can come off demeaning. All in all it's a alright comedy, that isn't all that funny but amusing in certain areas. However if your from North Korea, visited North Korea or know quite a bit about North Korea situation personally you will find this movie to be distasteful. Which is completely understandable.6.3/10",The Interview
21,sddavis63,Freedom of Expression Means You Can Say And Do And Write Things You're Not Proud Of,3,25 January 2015,"I can only assume that the current relatively high (7.1 as I write this) rating this gets here is more of a celebratory ""let's stick it to North Korea"" statement than a statement about the quality of the movie. Let's face it. This is pretty bad. If the North Koreans hadn't kicked up a fuss about it, ""The Interview"" would likely have died a fast and completely unlamented death. But kick up a fuss the North Koreans did, and the movie becomes a must see.It's rude and crude and filled with characters who, on the whole, are neither likable nor particularly interesting. The premise is absurd and for the most part the humour is weak. There are a few moments that offer chuckles, but basically this is drearily outlandish. The North Koreans would have done the world a favour if they had just ignored this, which would have resulted in the rest of us ignoring it. As it turns out, ""The Interview"" became a beacon for freedom of expression - and free expression doesn't have to be good, thoughtful or meaningful. Freedom of expression means people can say and do and write the stupidest things and get away with it. ""The Interview"" is proof of that.Seth Rogen and James Franco may be proud of the blow they struck on behalf of freedom of expression, but I can't see them being proud of the result of their movie-making.

22,Hellmant,"Definitely the most important movie of the year, any way you look at it!",10,28 December 2014,"'THE INTERVIEW': Five Stars (Out of Five) The most talked about, and controversial, movie of the year (or any year) has to be this sociopolitical action-comedy flick, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists attempting to assassinate the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. It was directed by Rogen and his longtime writing partner Evan Goldberg (the two also directed and co-wrote 'THIS IS THE END' as well as co-wrote 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS', 'SUPERBAD', 'THE GREEN HORNET' and other popular comedy flicks). It was written by Rogen, Goldberg and Dan Sterling (a TV writer and producer who's probably most famous for his work on 'THE DAILY SHOW'). It costars Randall Park, Diana Bang and Lizzy Caplan and features multiple cameos from stars like Eminem, Rob Lowe and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The film has become one of the biggest news stories of the year (in film, at the very least), beginning last June when the North Korean government first heard about the movie and threatened retaliation if it was released. Attention for the film was escalated even further when the studio behind the movie, Sony, was hacked (in late November) by an organization calling themselves 'Guardians of Peace' (or GOP). Several Sony films and confidential files were leaked online and then terrorist threats were made (by the GOP) to any theaters which showed the film. All of the major theater chains backed out of playing the movie and Sony cancelled the release of it entirely. That is until they received a lot of support from movie fans and advocates for artistic freedom and free speech; including celebrities (like George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Judd Apatow, Bill Maher and many others) and politicians (like Mitt Romeny, John McCain and President Obama). The movie was eventually released through indie theaters and internet sites (like YouTube, Google Play and X-Box Video), a day before it's original release date. I think all of the hype, media circus (about the film's release) and passionate civil rights advocacy made the movie an even better filmgoing experience. I absolutely loved it! Rogen plays Aaron Rapoport, a TV producer for the popular pop culture tabloid show 'Skylark Tonight'. Franco plays Aaron's best friend, Dave Skylark, who's also the host (of course) of 'Skylark Tonight'. Their show is a huge hit with mainstream viewers but Aaron feels like he's 'sold out' and doesn't produce quality news, like he had always dreamed of. When Dave finds out that Kim Jong-un (Park) is a big fan of their show, the duo sees it as a chance to finally gain some credibility; through interviewing the hated dictator. Jong-un accepts their interview offer but when the CIA finds out about it, they ask Aaron and Dave to assassinate the North Korean leader instead.It's almost impossible to separate the film from it's historical media coverage and the political events surrounding it's release, when judging it's quality. This is why I think some viewers are giving it a harsher and more negative review than it actually deserves; because they're trying to prove that they're not being influenced by all of it's hype. I loved it but I'll admit that part of the reason I enjoyed it so much is due to it's 'event status' and unprecedented media attention. Even so it's an amazing film; one of Rogen, Goldberg and Franco's best movies and it's easily the funniest film of 2014. It's also impressively directed (by far Rogen and Goldberg's best looking and edited movie, to date); including some spectacularly cool action scenes, some genuinely suspenseful moments and a decent amount of involving character development. I loved the social and political commentary and I'm also really glad the filmmakers were brave enough to actually make Kim Jong-un the movie's villain (rather than making up a fictional dictator for it's heroes to assassinate). It wouldn't have been nearly as good, or moving, if they had tried to please overly sensitive ultra-liberals (who think it's inappropriate). I don't believe in the death penalty or torture but I also don't care about the possible upset feelings of a mass murderer. It's a great film (and a very important one) because Jong-un is the movie's central antagonist. I also think opinions on the film's quality basically come down to whether you like comedy or not. A lot of seriously close minded people don't see the value or importance of humor, in life or in art. Those are the type of viewers that won't appreciate this film. Everyone else should love it. It's definitely one of the best movies of the year and by far the most important, any way you look at it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/GmFPW994ONg",The Interview
23,thesar-2,The un-Comedy,1,24 December 2014,"Dang, you were so close, Kim Jong-un. You failed at stopping probably the only comedy I've ever seen that could make The Love Guru incredibly funny.The Interview should never have been conducted. Not with this talent. Awful were the ""jokes,"" predictable were the set-ups and uninterested was the cast. Seth, James and everyone involved should've known better. Should've known most screenplays need more than one rewrite.A lot of comedy premises take after ones before them; that's a given. The trick is to improve on them or at minimally least, add your own spin. None of that was present here. Heck, even the enormously lazy set-up (an old friend pushes our ""hero"" into serious news when all he's accustomed to is interviewing real-life guests and basically showing Shia LaBeouf'isms, but without any humor) takes all-but 10 seconds of screen time that sets him and his non-gay soul mate to interview the supreme leader of North Korea. Yada, yada, these bumbling idiots – but not the funny, on-screen kinds we're used to, especially from Franco and Rogen – get ""trained"" by the CIA to assassinate said leader.I cannot count how many scenes that were humorless, but suffice to say, it's from minute one to the over-long conclusion at just under two hours. But, unbelievably worse than that, not one actor in this movie looked happy to be there. They were merely here to cash a paycheck one that might not have come to pass due to all the real-life threats.Speaking of those threats and hacks and controversyseriously, attacking this terrible movie only drew the worst kind of attention back to the attackers: proving the movie right. I really wouldn't want to be on this movie's side, even for a split second, but attempting to block this movie and trying to prove to the world you're the opposite of how they portrayed you in this very movie, is so very funny.Maybe the only thing funny at all about this bomb.* * *Final thoughts: Oh, and even if the movie was near-masterpiece level, threatening human lives over one person's art and fiction telling, is what makes me ashamed of the human race. I am very troubled that, even with the multitudes of progress our kind has made since I was born, I strongly doubt I will live to see the day that we become even a tenth of our potential. The Star Trek universe of humans actually working together for a common goal, for the common good, is fictional, but oh so desired.",The Interview

25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Average comedy that got some indirect publicity,7,12 December 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Dave Skylark (James Franco) and Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen) are a presenter/producer team who've become a massive ratings success after getting Eminem to reveal his homosexuality on air. In the heat of their flavour of the month status, they are approached by the CIA to arrange an interview with North Korean president Kim Jung Un (Randall Park), during which they will assassinate him. After a lot of persuasion, they eventually go along with the plan, only for him to captivate Dave with his seemingly less-unfriendly-than-he-seems persona. For more reasons than the obvious, the assignment won't go to plan.Sometimes, a movie that seems pre-destined for a pretty average fate can unexpectedly receive a windfall of publicity that catapults it to a status far beyond where it was headed. Such was the case with The Interview, Seth Rogen's latest comedy in February this year, when brutal North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il unsurprisingly didn't take very kindly to a film sending him up, and threatened to launch a massive cyber attack on the United States, causing the film to be withdrawn. Sony are hardly chaired by stupid people, and someone at least must have anticipated such a backlash, but then taking risks is something people just have to do sometimes, and fair play to them.Some negotiation must have been reached, and it could be that the emphasis isn't on the NK leader as much as just being a typically lowbrow, juvenile comedy that is pretty much par for the course in Hollywood comedies these days. On this level, if taken in the right mood, it is fairly entertaining, although it's all too murkily shot and dour to have the feel of a comedy. There's also a long winded feel to it, like it seemed focused on establishing a plot when this was hardly the priority.With the hype boiled down and the finished product all that remains before you, what you're left with is something really very average that just serves as your typical rambunctious Hollywood comedy. ***",The Interview
26,bowmanblue,"So wrong, yet so right",8,22 March 2018,"'The Interview' was never destined to be a mainstream success. This happens to some films because they're released before their time, have the wrong star, or try and be too clever for their own good. However, in the minority of these cases, the reason the film doesn't succeed is because of pressure from an entire country that doesn't like the way it's being portrayed on screen. At the time of release, the company that made 'The Interview' was under cyber hacking attack by North Korea, forcing them to seriously rethink whether or not to release this film in the cinema. In fact... will I get in trouble from people on the other side of the world just for writing that I enjoyed it?!It's about a mainstream TV chat-show host (James Franco) who finds out that his US low-brow entertainment show is - believe it or not - actually quite liked by the leader of communist state North Korea. He's then offered the once-in-a-lifetime chance to fly to North Korea and do what no journalist has done before, interview its 'glorious' leader, Kim Jong-un. This, he readily accepts because he thinks that once he's interviewed President Kim it will cement his name in journalistic history. However, when the CIA hear of this, they decide that it would be far more beneficial for the rest of the world if James Franco (and his producer, played by Seth Rogen) simply assassinate the 'madman' instead.Now, if you're not too familiar with the Franco/Rogen combo then you might not know that they've starred in numerous films together and are generally pretty good buds in real life. Therefore, once again, they allow their natural chemistry to carry out the dialogue of this movie. However, said 'dialogue' is pretty 'adult' in nature, so expect much of their interactions to be s3x-based or peppered with drug references. The two of them may be good (if you're generally into their particular brand of humour), but I thought that it was Randall Park who stole every scene he was in. For he had the unenviable task of portraying the Leader himself and, in my opinion, did a great job (I'm not saying that Kim Jong-un would act like this in real life, but, for the purposes of a comedy film, I think it's fair to say that this was a good way of showing the man who - currently - could be the biggest threat to the West on the planet).As I said, the humour is adult and quite 'bawdy' at times, but if you can forgive that (and are generally a fan of the two leads and their recent collaborations) then you should enjoy this. They even put in a couple of quite fun action set-pieces in the final act and, although the CGI is a little ropey here and there, I think for a comedy that isn't really an 'action blockbuster' you can forgive this. I definitely think that 'The Interview' could well be the funniest film that uses North Korea as the bad-guys (oh, apart from 'Team America' - in which case 'The Interview' is the funniest 'live action' film about North Korea - and it has a cute puppy. What more could you want?).",The Interview
27,dromasca,aiming too low,5,4 January 2019,"I picked this film as end-of-the-year entertainment because I was curious about the light comedy that created a lot of noise around it by the time it was released. The stories around the making, the delayed launching, and the disputes after 'The Interview' was premiered in 2014 end by being more interesting than the film itself.Seeing this film four years after its release and remembering the whole scandal at international scale that was caused by it makes one reflect about the changes in both politics and film-making that took place in this rather short interval. Some of the political developments in the relations between North Korea and the United States in these years could not have been imagined even by the creative script writers at Hollywood, and as a result some of the themes of the film are overcome by events. On the other hand the moralistic trends at Hollywood are stronger today than four years ago, and I doubt that some of the jokes in the film would have made it in the more politically correct film industry of 2018.The premises of 'The Interview' have some potential, with the trash TV shows anchor (James Franco) and his producer (Seth Rogen) being recruited by the CIA in order to penetrate the hermetic country and try to assassinate its leader. There is a lot of comic potential in the contrast between the two Americans living a very 'decadent' style of life and their encounter with the realities (fake or true) of the Communist country, in the clash of cultures, and in the errors of translation between languages and perceptions. It's the territory where Sacha Baron Cohen has made some real marvels, but directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen seem to never have intended to go beyond vulgar comedy, with very few (mostly verbal) sparks.The result is a parody that succeeds to extract some laughs but cannot keep the comical pace for the whole duration of the film, becoming almost ridiculous by the end. The satirical approach works better when dealing with the American TV industry, it is clear actually that they know the material much better than the Korean realities and characters which are described using superficial stereotypes. Actors James Franco and Seth Rogen are reasonably funny. 'The Interview' could have been a much better film, but the producers and their team aimed too low in several ways. A few years after its making the film looks already old for many reasons.",The Interview
28,lesleyharris30,"Very Grateful to Finally get to Experience this in All its Glory,",8,20 February 2015,"The Interview is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. I wasn't sure if I was ever going to get to see this movie, and was very grateful that I finally got to experience one of the most controversial films ever made on the big screen, it kept me laughing all the way through and there were some things done that I simply couldn't believe. Controversy aside, it is a genuinely clever comedy that features several cameos from unlikely celebrities that were well able to laugh at themselves. Seth Rogen and James Franco both shine in the lead roles as they always do, I love seeing these two together, it is so clear they are good friends and that makes their performances and the things that they do so much better. This movie does certainly have flaws, its biggest issue was that it repeated jokes too often (ie Firework,Lord of the Rings references), I'll admit this was unnecessary, but you can easily look past it. Many people were disappointed by this but I think that it is simply because they were expecting so much more because of the drama surrounding it, but at the end of the day, it is a Seth Rogen comedy that dosen't shy away too much from movies like Neighbors and This is the End, I think people will look back at it in a few years time and appreciate how cleverly written and risky it really is. I can definitely see why it was so controversial, and that is what made it so funny, the fact that is was nearly banned forever made it even more enjoyable and I would recommend the Interview to anyone looking for a good comedy or adventure.I would like to see these characters again. After a talk show host is given a massive opportunity to interview the dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, himself and his producer are assigned by the CIA to assassinate him.

Yes this film was about killing Kim Jong Un but really, it seemed like Hollywood just wants to be funny and poke fun at anyone that they can think of. I disagree completely on this because there wasn't any reason to poke fun at someone who isn't worth it or even, they just wanted to pick him out of a hat just to be lazy. Well lemme tell ya, they just can't get enough of crap!I found the jokes amongst Seth Rogen and James Franco were stupid plus awful you know. Both of them are awesome, however, it wasn't the first time they failed their movie roles together. The other worst movie 'This is the end' should be a prequel to this because both of the movies are just complete failures.

Watching this flick i kinda get the idea of why North Korea had such a response to this farce - their leader is shown in not lets just say polite colors. Of course, it's a comedy, but still, if North Korea would have created a comedy about Dumb and Dumber who travels to USA to kill and eventually kills their president, it wouldn't be the most popular movie in USA to say the least.

Hacking caused the leak of personal employee data and some embarrassing emails by company executives as well as releasing digital copies of yet unreleased films.

This movie became bigger than it's originally supposed to be due to all the controversy that came with the movie release. I'm just surprise that the movie finally came out due to all the threats! It was nearly pulled by Sony Pictures, after the North Korea hacker group, ""Guardians of Peace"" leak Sony's sensitive internal information on the web, a few weeks earlier and threated cinema chains with 9/11 type terrorism threats. Not wanting, another 'Aurora', recurring to the 2012 Aurora shooting where a gunman did a mass shooting in a Century movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, during a midnight screening of the film, The Dark Knight Rises. A number of major North American cinema chains canceled screenings in the interest of safety. Sony then canceled the theatrical release of The Interview, drawing criticism from the media, Hollywood figures and U.S. President Barack Obama. After initially stating that it had no plans to release the film, Sony made The Interview available for online rental and purchase on December 24, and via a limited release at selected cinemas on December 25. It has earned $15 million online, making it Sony's most successful online movie. It received mixed reviews when it did came out. In my opinion, this movie was just alright. It's nowhere near the levels of Charlie Chaplin's 1940 hit, The Great Dictator or Stanley Kubrick 1964's hit, Dr. Strangelove. Still, it's surprising very funny. Directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg in their second directorial work, following 2013's This Is the End. The Interview is an American political satire comedy about two TV journalists, TV host Dave Skylark (James Franco) and producer Aaron Rappaport (Seth Rogen) who run the celebrity tabloid show call ""Skylark Tonight."" Both are feeling overlooked by the news media who see them as jokes, but when they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un (Randall Park), things starts to change. Things become much more complex, as they're recruited by the CIA to turn their trip to Pyongyang into an assassination mission. A lot of people might not like this film, due to the style of humor that Rogen and Goldberg has. The film is crammed with Rogen and Goldberg's brand of cheeky, crass, often childish, frequently offensive, and ultimately hilarious toilet humor. The movie attempt at a political satire was kinda disappointing. It was less a political satire and more like a bromance with jokes about body parts and bodily functions. Still the movie does have some smart jokes worth checking out. It's nice to see Seth Rogen once again as the funny Straight man of the duo and James Franco as the over the top character. Seth Rogen and James Franco work well with each other. It remind me, so much of 2008's Pineapple Express. Kim Jung Un is made a fool here, but I have to give Randall Park, some credit. He gave the character, some really need human-like characteristic. For the role, played it, sheepish and shy, rather than robotic and strict, making Kim Jung Un into a more a nearly likable three-dimensional character, than an unlikable daffy cartoon caricature. You really feel for him, when he ask, if drinking margaritas were gay. You also feel the strong connection with him and the Katy Perry's song, 'Fireworks'. This makes the idea of James Franco's character being fool into believing he's just a misunderstood guy more believable and more heartbreak when Dave Skylark find out the truth. Would, I love to see more depth and time spent into exploring that. Yes, but the movie had to move on, and show why Kim Jung Un is indeed crazy. Indeed, this is more love to the character than most satire comedies would give to their political target, they're portraying. The movie is welled acted from both main characters and supporting. The Interview opens with a priceless bit featuring Eminem, and other celebrities. All of those sequences work pretty well. The film absolutely nails how the mainstream America media overplay the audiences want for celebrity gossip over real news. The pacing moves quickly, though the film takes a short dip in the second act as the duo have a pointless party scene before their CIA training. I really could do without the pointless drug scenes. However, the story quickly rebounds as the team moves into the misadventure in North Korea with a soaring climax full of action, suspense, and some gratuitous over the top violence. I can understand why North Korea hate this film. A film about the assassination of a foreign leader is kinda ugly, but its fiction. There been countless movies, where American presidents had been assassinated or attempt to. Let's remember, that 2006's Death of a President had fictional assassination of then U.S president, George W. Bush, after all. Even if the film is in bad taste, it is all protected by the 1st amendment and films like the Interview shouldn't be banned, just for that only reason. A lot of conspiracy theories think Sony did all this stuff for publicity stunt. I doubt it. Major international incident create. Sensitive e-mails leaked that destroyed their relationships with almost all important people in Hollywood. Major Movie scripts leaked. A bunch of their movies stolen and put up for free download. Some of them prior to theatrical release. People seriously need to remove the tinfoil hats, if they think that. Overall: It didn't felt like a Propaganda or a serious political film. It's just a good popcorn fun film. So sit back, relax and let yourself have a good laugh.",The Interview
34,nairtejas,Great Proportions Of Nonsense. ♦ 33%,3,25 December 2014,"While the ""pigs"" managed to entertain us with ""This Is The End (2012)"" & torture us with ""Neighbors (2014),"" their latest political venture, which turned into the most anticipated film of 2014 winter all thanks to its alleged contents, is a nonsensical parody about a surgical attack on the most isolated nation in the world and its leader.I personally like Seth Rogen since his Pineapple Express days, and do not dislike James Franco even though he recently tried to sabotage a Falkner novel's legacy. I like their ideas and how they come up with humor. But in The Interview, the case is different. The humor, which should usually be the cynosure of such comedies, lags way behind as we are served with piping hot ennui-inducing madness. The reporter-director duo (Franco, Rogen) do engage in funny blabbering and that is the only reason why I rate this film a humble 3 out of 10.While the rest of the build-up seems like a mix of a detailed chronicle out of a Houellebecq novel and unfathomable porn, the second half spirals into typical post-war ending. There is no traction that guides the viewers to take note or at least laugh about. The writers have even tried to experiment with reality: if such a situation builds up in reality, what would be the effect, and all. But, everything is so loud and unclear, it fails.While I appreciate Sony for finally releasing the film and thus, exercising freedom of speech, I do not see any substance in the celluloid, regardless of its genre. The fact that it will get a broader audience puts my opinion in a cesspool of protracted and polarized reviews.BOTTOM LINE: Other than few chuckles and a de-facto description of life at North Korea, The Interview should be found next to rejected factory seconds.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

35,The-Sarkologist,An amusing jab at the North Korean dictatorship,7,28 February 2015,"I am wondering whether the whole Sony hacking scandal was an attempt to promote this movie, because in many ways it seems like it was. Personally, I don't think this movie needed all that much promoting because, well, anybody who has loved Rogan's previous jaunts would pretty much like this film – in many cases it is classic Rogan and Franco. However, I doubt whether this film would have been as well known and anticipated if it wasn't for the Sony hack because the whole scandal seemed to have been centered around this one film.If it was the North Koreans then personally, after seeing this film, I am not at all surprised. It is not at all flattering of the North Korean leadership, and in many cases it promotes the so called free society of the United States over and above the deceptive society of North Korea. The problem is that I have never been to North Korea, and I suspect that if I did visit the place, and wasn't locked up for being a Westerner, then I would only be allowed to see a sanitised version of the place. Yet it is still propaganda. The film is suggesting that outsiders are not allowed to see the real North Korea, but then I suspect that as an outsider you wouldn't be allowed to see the real North Korea.Still, it is an hilarious movie that had me in stitches. Okay, I probably don't need to outline a plot because we all know what it is about – it is about a journalist that wants to make his name by interviewing the supreme leader of North Korea. What we don't know is that this journalist happens to the host of one of those trashy American talk shows that seeks to dig up dirt on celebrities (such as Eminem), however he is not taken all that seriously amongst his peers, so when he discovers that Kim Jong Un loves his show, he decides to make this an opportunity to show his true metal.Mind you, a celebrity does not travel to North Korea without the CIA getting involved, and when they first appear at his door we get the first mention of the running joke about 'honeypotting'. I'm not going to say any more about that because that will pretty much spoil the movie for you. Still having the tunnel, and Seal Team Six appearing at the end really rounded out what is, in the end, what you would expect from a mindless Seth Rogan comedy.",The Interview
36,sol-,The Great Dictator,6,22 July 2016,"Best known nowadays for the controversy it sparked at the time with Sony Pictures refusing to release it, 'The Interview' is a curious film to watch several months later. Viewed as a film on its own terms, 'The Interview' makes for decent entertainment, but the main virtue is the chemistry between co-leads Seth Rogen and James Franco, which (as per 'Pineapple Express' and 'This is the End') is as excellent as ever. The jokes vary quite a bit in effectiveness. Several are crude and juvenile, including throwaway lines about goat humping and fingers being bitten off, but there are genuinely funny moments here and there. Rogen does a particularly good near pantomime routine as he tries to make out with a Korean lady without using or closing the palm of his hand (which has a poison strip attached to it). Regardless of how humorous one finds the film, it is nevertheless hard to escape how in-poor-taste the basically storyline is, making of fun of a dictator still alive at the time of the film's production. Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator' is an interesting counterpoint. One of the key reasons why Chaplin's effort is funnier is because its parallels to Hitler are so obvious without them ever being explicitly stated. Using parallels also allowed Chaplin to make everything comically exaggerated, whereas the options to exaggerate in 'The Interview' are limited since the country and dictator in question really exist. Whatever the case, 'The Interview' is a largely enjoyable affair with energetic performances all round; the potential for more though is striking.",The Interview
37,tomgillespie2002,Blighted by haphazard plotting and toothless satire,6,22 July 2015,"The alleged attack on Sony by North Korean cyber-hackers in protest over The Interview's depiction of their divine ruler, Kim Jong-un, did nothing but wonders for the film. Scandalising a film does little more than promote it to a wider audience, so directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Green must have been rubbing their hands together when Sony hit the panic button. It raised questions over the futility of censorship and led to a wonderful middle-finger salute on IMDb, with the average user rating bumped to a perfect 10 before it had even been released. Now that the furore has died down, The Interview can be seen for what it is: a scattershot comedy that raises a few laughs but ultimately lacks the balls required to make a decent satire.TV producer Aaron Rapaport (Rogen) starts to question his body of work after receiving a dressing down from a former school friend, who is now working on the highly respected 60 Minutes. Aaron works on Skylark Tonight, a glossy chat-show in which his friend Dave Skylark (James Franco) interviews various celebrities about a variety of shallow topics (when rumours break that Matthew McConaughey has been caught having sex with a goat, Dave demands that they get the goat). Dave hears a rumour that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Randall Park), who is threatening the U.S. with a nuclear attack, is a big fan of the show, so Aaron sees this as the perfect opportunity to cover some serious news and travels to rural China in the hope of arranging a historic interview.When the two are approached by CIA Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) to assassinate the chubby dictator, an air-tight plan is set in motion that only these two idiots could possibly screw up. A hand plaster containing a deadly ricin strip is all that it will take, but as seen when Dave lets loose a sneeze during a rehearsal, things most likely won't go to plan. The scene is set for comedy set-pieces aplenty, but the film only occasionally hits its mark. Whether this is down to the growing trend of using improvisation for laughs, the over-reliance on dick jokes, or the inclusion of yet another manifestation of the familiar Seth Rogen persona, The Interview rarely rises above amusing. Personally, I find James Franco's crazy- eyed lunacy both hilarious and quite intense at times, but here even the most hardcore Franco fans may have their patience stretched by his over-acting.Yet, when it's good, it's very good. When Dave is waltzed away for a night of drinking, womanising, bromanctic heart-to-heart's, and listening to Katy Perry in a huge tank, Franco and Park have great chemistry and Park clearly has a fun time with his character, to the point that it becomes difficult to hate Kim even though it becomes clear that he is a master manipulator. It's a perfectly enjoyable experience for the most part, but is too blighted by haphazard plotting and toothless satire to be the film that Goldberg and Rogen are really capable of. Perhaps some more time spent on the script and less time making it up as they went along would have tightened their grip, and some real courage and ambition may have put it in the same league one of cinema's greatest on-the-nose satires, Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940), which left a certain floppy-haired anti-Semite seething",The Interview
38,Floated2,For a certain audience,8,4 October 2015,"The Interview having previous causing much controversy within the last year. Those times are often enough and extreme enough that Seth Rogen and his best buddies Evan Goldberg and James Franco get away with murder, at least in the cinematic sense.The Interview is the second directorial effort from Rogen and Goldberg. They also indulged us with the apocalyptic comedy, This is the End. That 2013 movie took place at Franco's Hollywood house (or so the story told us). The new movie casts Franco as a fictional character: gonzo TV host Dave Skylark. With all the controversy that has passed with the film, for certain audience alike the film could have been worth its hype.
As a rewatch 04/18/19' The Interview remains an overall over the top type of comedy. Many inside jokes and overall continuity that are mainly hits. The best part of the film is the chemistry between James Franco and Seth Rogen, as they are engaging to watch. The character of President Kim was also better than remembered, many funny scenes with him and Francos's character.",The Interview
39,eddie_baggins,"Funny as World War 3, truly awful",1,10 June 2015,"It's a crying shame that the movie which almost created a new world ending war is such a criminally unfunny and downright amateurish production, a movie so devoid of any originality or smarts that you truly wonder if the reason behind the threats of war were in fact made so the general movie going public would never have to see such atrocities committed on screen.In a new career low for all involved, Seth Rogen and long term best buddy Evan Goldberg's tale starts off with the films funniest singular scene involving ""Rap God"" Eminem but from there everything that happens in the Interview ranges from worryingly juvenile, unquestionably unfunny, awkward and horribly misinterpreted. It's a 2 hour comedy of indecipherable badness; you'll constantly be asking yourself how those involved could've allowed the ship to sink so quickly, it's not like the actors and behind scenes talent in the film are first time filmmakers, they're people who've achieved success and proved their worth in similar films yet don't showcase a single ounce of talent in this downright atrocious affair.While we've made many mentions to James Franco on this blog before, the frequently busy actor delivers what can only be described as one of recent cinemas worst performances as the shock interviewer Dave Skylark. Whether Franco is yelling, pulling faces or just generally being a jerk he is an oh so slapable presence that fails to produce a drop of charisma or charm. With Franco on career worst form even his bro-mance with the ever same Seth Rogen can't save material as weak as this and Rogen too struggles to bring his Aaron to life with any form of his acting talents. Where films like This is the End succeeded on gross out gags working on the back of chemistry between these men, The Interview falls on their smug looking faces. With such intolerable leads any chance the film had of even having any slight political merits are shot down and the film becomes an exercise of pure self-indulgence for the actors to fulfil their own wishful inklings.There's really not much more to say about the Interview other than the fact as a comedy it's a big fat fail, as a political satire it's non-existent and as an acting/writing showcase it acts merely as an example of what not to do if you want to make a professional film. With all the hoop-lah about the Interview towards the end of last year it's justifiable that many where hyped for its release (myself included) but even fans of the Franco/Rogen brand of humour would struggle to find much joy in this torrid journey to the mysterious lands of North Korea, although the site of Seth Rogen disposing of a capsule in an unmentionable part of his body is surely cinema at it's finest? Half a Katy Perry power ballad out of 5",The Interview
40,leonblackwood,Jokes went a bit too far! 4/10,4,14 June 2015,"Review: This movie isn't politically correct in a lot of ways and I can understand why some people got upset with the storyline but if you watch it from a entertainment point of view, which is what it's supposed to be, it is a fun ride with some over the top jokes. Its about 2 buddies who run a successful celebrity tabloid channel who want to be taken seriously. They find out that the Northern Korea leader, Kim Jong-un, is a fan of there show so they travel to North Korea to try and get an interview with him. Once he agrees to the interview, they move into his palace and they find out that all is not what it seems. When they finally go through with the interview, Kim Jong-un's true personality comes out and the 2 buddies end up fleeing for there life's, with the help from 2 of the Koreans guards. The storyline is really far fetched and stupid in parts and the jokes do go a bit to far sometimes but you can't fault it for originality. The studio ended up losing a lot of money from the movie because of the terrible rumours and computer viruses which came out before its release. With this in mind, you do feel like it was a lot of hype over nothing because the film is more silly than a political statement. With that aside, I did laugh at a couple of the scenes and I liked when Kim Jong-un and James Franco became buddies but it does go a bit too far. Watchable!Round-Up: Although this movie had a lot of negative press surrounding it, I doubt that it will damage Franco and Rogens careers. Franco who made his debut in Never Been Kissed in 1999, has starred in well over 80 movies in his career and he has covered most genres. He is the driving force in this movie, because of his outrageous lines and weird face expressions and he did seem to out act Seth Rogen in many ways. At 37 years of age, he really has achieved a lot in his career so I doubt that he will take the negative press that seriously. Seth Rogen has also achieved a lot since his debut in Donnie Darko in 2001 and he's mostly known for his role in the 40 Year Old Virgin (2005) and Knocked Up (2007). His movies usually gross quite a bit of money at the box office so I doubt that his career will be damaged with this film. He did direct this movie alongside Evan Goldberg, who also directed This Is The End with Seth Rogen and the 2 are pairing up again to make Console Wars in 2016. Anyway, they really did push the boundaries with this film and it didn't go down well with most audiences, because the problems in North Korea still exist so I'm not surprised that some people were still a bit touchy with this subject matter. Budget: $43million Worldwide Gross: $11millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/action movies about 2 buddies who want to push there celebrity tabloid TV show to its limit by interviewing Kim Jong-un, whose a fan of there show. 4/10",The Interview
41,TheMovieDiorama,"The Interview may have nearly started World War III, but the world would've ended happily after watching this.",7,24 February 2018,"I was not expecting this! Like...at all! This was a blast, a nuclear blast. I had probably way too much fun. The controversy surrounding this during 2014 pretty much nearly sparked global decimation. This film then became a statement for the freedom of speech and artistic integrity. And despite the depiction of assassinating Kim Jung-Un as a threat...I loved this. Staging an interview with the supreme leader of North Korea who is being probed questions by an eccentric flamboyant entertainer was just magic. It was like a campier version of The Graham Norton Show, mixed in with the same level of violence from The Jeremy Kyle Show. I mean this was bonkers! Fingers are being bitten off, tanks are rolling around to the soothing sounds of Katy Perry's 'Firework' and there's a whole lot of anus jokes. The crude humour might put some people off, and I do believe it is rather excessive...but it's just a bit of fun. No harm done really. James Franco was hilarious and is now possibly one of my favourite comedic actors. Seth Rogen was Seth Rogen. Randall Park...well, brave move sir. I thought the whole comedic timing and screenplay was pretty decent, most I've laughed in a comedy for quite some time which is always an impressive accomplishment. Just seeing Kim Jung play basketball, cry about margaritas and generally seem like a normal laddish lad felt...I don't know...surreal. Exclaiming ""what the actual flip is going on!?"" to my soul as I watched him scream with joy as he drives a tank. My life is now complete. The barrage of random scenes and callback humour can feel exhausting towards the end but to be honest I had so much fun that I really don't care. This review is so inconsistently structured and feels like a stream of consciousness (apologies...), but it reflects the craziness of the film. If you're having doubts about watching this, don't. Give it a shot! Dave Skylark is my new favourite character. ""Signing off!""",The Interview
42,matthewssilverhammer,Not Worth the Hub-Bub,5,11 July 2019,"This movie peaked with the Eminem interview at the very beginning. From there, it's mostly a 3rd tier Rogen comedy with all the trappings (ecstasy scene, pop song motif, ejaculation humor, random super violence) that we unfortunately mistook for being a smart satire. Not that it isn't funny; at times, it certainly is...but it's also not nearly as funny as it wants to be, and nowhere near as poignant.

43,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Behind the national controversy is just a lot of Rogen and Franco goofin' off,5,7 January 2015,"When major theater chains decided not to show ""The Interview"" because of terrorism threats from North Korean hackers, Hollywood saw an unparalleled degree of hype surrounding a film that otherwise would've received a moderate spotlight at best. But while news buzz for this comedy about a TV host and his producer being recruited to assassinate Kim Jong-un can impact marketing and maybe box office numbers, there's one thing it can't change: whether the film's any good.James Franco and Seth Rogen star as Dave Skylark and Aaron Rapaport, host and producer of ""Skylark Tonight,"" a long-running primetime interview program known for covering celebrity gossip rather than hard-hitting journalism. When Dave and Aaron learn that Kim Jong-un is a fan of the show, they realize landing an interview with him could legitimize their work. After Kim agrees, the CIA, represented by Lizzy Caplan, pays the pair a visit and recruits them to kill the North Korean Supreme Leader.Prolific comedy writers (and recently directors, including this film) Rogen and Evan Goldberg — along with longtime TV comedy writer Dan Sterling — have crafted one of their strangest premises yet. In fact, there's an opportunity to do something genius in the realm of satire, but the biting moments are quick and fleeting in a film that's by and large a farce about two guys in way over their heads.""The Interview"" seems to primarily exist just to give Rogen and Franco an even weirder set of cinematic circumstances in which to dick around and say outrageous things to one another. Those who already take issue with Franco will likely find Dave Skylark his most insufferable comic character to date, while Rogen plays the straighter character lacking in street smarts. The two definitely find golden banter throughout the movie, but considering the large percentage of ""The Interview"" that can be constituted as banter, there's not as much hit as miss.The Rogen-Goldberg formula still has its merits, but ""The Interview"" provides evidence that its effectiveness is wearing thin. The predictability of the plot, for example, really works to the film's detriment. The story has a clear structure: Dave and Aaron feel motivated to do something important, they schedule an interview with Kim, the CIA recruits them and prepares them for the mission, they go to North Korea for the interview and to kill Kim. The only unpredictable chunk is the last one — what happens after they get to Kim's ""palace."" The way they choose to go about it is mostly juvenile and devoid of suspense until the actual interview occurs, but even then, you can always depend on Rogen and Goldberg to up the chaos factor in the third act, usually with comic violence.The humor of ""The Interview"" hinges a lot on recurring jokes in addition to the usual genitals and bathroom humor. The concept of ""honey-potting"" and Katy Perry's ""Firework"" are two jokes/references that the script tries to get a lot of mileage out of. The situational humor is mostly spoiled by obviously plot devices. This isn't to say ""The Interview"" isn't funny, but when you can see through the jokes and situation humor and their use feels obvious, it takes away from the escapism that comes from good comedy.There's also a lot of Rogen and Franco. The supporting cast is uncharacteristically small in this one, especially compared to Rogen and Goldberg's cameo-loaded ""This Is The End."" Aside from Caplan, King Jong-un (Randall Park) and Sook (Diana Bang), Kim's head of communications, no one else gets much screen time. That puts a lot on Franco and Rogen's shoulders, which, capable as they are, have six plus years (since ""Pineapple Express"" at least) of wear and tear on them. So the brazen concept of ""The Interview"" is really the freshest thing about it.Rogen and Goldberg as writers and Rogen and Franco as actors have done better and will do better again, most likely, than ""The Interview."" What seems like an outlandish and exciting premise would've probably been best as a 30-minute ""South Park"" episode. And when you think about all the insulting satire that show has committed over the years, you start to realize what ""The Interview"" really is once you strip away the national ""controversy.""~Steven CThanks for reading!

44,paul-allaer,"""That was a gift from Stalin."" ""In our country, we pronounce that Stallone""",8,25 December 2014,"""The Interview"" (2014 release; 112 min.) brings the story of how an entertainment reporter Dave Skylark (played by James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (played by Seth Rogen) get an opportunity to interview Kim Jong-un. the ""Supreme Leader"" of North Korea. As the movie opens, we see a young girl (maybe 7 or 8) sing a patriotic song for North Korean officials. The song turns hilariously into an anti-America rant. Soon thereafter, we see Skylark interview Eminem (another hilarious scene). When Skylark and Rapoport find out that Jng-un is a big fan of the show, they manage an invite to North Korea. The CIA then pays a visit and convinces the guys that they need to ""take out"" Jong-un. At this point we're barely 20 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience.Couple of comments: at this point as much needs to be said about the events surrounding the limited release of the movie as about the movie itself. Let's start with the movie itself: first and foremost, I had heard and read mixed things about the movie, so when my (grown) kids and I went to see it on Christmas day, I had pretty low expectations. Turns out the movie is actually not nearly as bad as I had been led the believe. Yes, there is stupid ""potty"" humor and yes, it's all very much over the top. But there are zingers left and right that will have you smile if not laugh out loud. One of the many, many examples: when Jong-un and Skylark are taking a tour of Jong-un's place, at some point they come across a huge tank. Comments Jong-un: ""That was a gift to my grandfather by Stalin"". Replies Skylark: ""in our country, we pronounce that Stallone"", ha! And on and on. Randall Park as Kim Jong-un is outstanding. Kudos also to Set Rogen, who also co-rwote and co-directed the movie.As to the limited release, I at first was horrified that Sony gave in to the threats, but felt better when the limited Christmas day release was announced. The movie played on one screen at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and it's a good thin I had bought tickets on-line beforehand, as the matinée screening was sold out (as were all other screenings, apparently). The crowd was really into it, laughing and hollering and whooping it up. When the end titles started rolling, the crowd even gave an applause. In all, this truly was a ""movie event"", and all three of us were very happy we were part of it. ""The Interview"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",The Interview
45,jtindahouse,Forgets to be funny too often,6,28 December 2014,"With all the controversy that has surrounded the release of 'The Interview' you would really hope they'd made a good quality film for it all to be worth it. Overall it was a valiant effort but too often it forgets to do the number one thing a comedy must - make you laugh. Seth Rogen and James Franco have tremendous chemistry there's no doubt about it, but there's simply nothing here for them to work with. The script spends too much time trying to tell its story (and also get a message across) that it simply forgets to include jokes. A lot of film humour these days is improvised of course so Franco and Rogen have to be somewhat to blame as well.The one truly brilliant part of the film comes in the first few minutes from an Eminem cameo. The man is funny. It's hard to know if he's even trying to be as funny as he is, but his dry delivery of every line is absolutely perfect. We do know of course that he is a genuinely talented actor after his fine performance in '8 Mile'. Unfortunately after that things just tend to drift along a bit. The story is interesting enough to keep you tuned in and things really turn quite violent near the end, but overall I think you'd have to call this a near miss for this comedy team. Nevermind, I will still be tuning in to whatever they venture onto next.",The Interview
46,BeneCumb,Memorable in a twisted way,6,3 January 2015,"I can imagine that many people went to see The Interview with (too) high expectations and became thus disappointed, but it is still no 1/10 movie; please remember, that there are plenty of those who choose smell instead of odor :). Yeah, the plot is odd and strained, with too many clichés and references to Bond-movies and Tarantino, promoting suspicious values using f-words and plain conclusions. Rogen-Goldberg, however, has never been to everyone's taste (I find them too blunt and commonplace), but the movie has no confrontation of pleasant Americans vs. unpleasant North-Koreans. In fact, Kim Jong-un (skilfully performed by Randall Park) is often the wisest and nicest character, and the movie laughs a lot at media figures and program concepts in Western countries and the desire of intelligences to solve problems via double-crossings and even assassinations. And I am sure that life in North Korea was depicted better than it actually is, only with indirect references to its miserable conditions and brutal government, known from multiple documentaries. Plus there are frequent attempts to eliminate sitting public figures all over the world, so why making steam about this?!After all, it is odd that a country (total dictatorship) has criticized another, much more democratic country for the movie in question, as no US public money was used, and the creators are from Canada, after all.",The Interview

If it weren't for this controversy The Interview would only be remembered as a minor comedy film.The film reteamed Seth Rogen and James Franco after This is the End. They play an entertainment interviewer and his producer who scores an interview with Kim Jung-Un and get recruited by the CIA to assassin the North Korean leader. Rogen worked with his regular partner, Evan Goldberg, and together they made a comedy that was grand in scale: it opened with a mission test and ends with a massive gun battle.

It's easy viewing.",The Interview
48,dfranzen70,"Enjoyable, likable, and funny.",7,25 January 2015,"The Interview received a lot of attention in the month leading up to its scheduled release date when the North Korean government strongly objected to the film's content, and it's likely that without this attention the movie would have been seen as just another raunchy Seth Rogan/Evan Goldberg effort. While this is no comedy masterpiece, it's enjoyable, likable, and funny. The film is happily not overplotted, and the characters are given just the right amount of depth. This is a simple film that never takes itself seriously, despite the subject matter (the assassination of a world leader).Dave Skylark (James Franco) is a glitzy, airhead of a celebrity interviewer. He's just completed his 1,000th show, all with his trusty producer Aaron Raporort (Seth Rogen) at the helm. But poor Aaron wants to get away from tabloid TV and do some real news for a change. Turns out that North Korean dictator/snazzy dresser Kim Jong-un (Randall Park) is a huge fan of Skylark Tonight, and soon arrangements are made for the duo to travel to Pyongyang for some face-to-face time with the Supreme Leader.The CIA, realizing an awesome opportunity, visits Skylark and Rapoport. Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) quickly trains the boys on how best to kill lil' Kim: with a poisonous ricin strip whose effects aren't felt for 12 hours. It does seem simple - just get Kim to shake Skylark's hand - but it's just not to be. In Pyongyang, Dave and Aaron are met by Sook (Diana Bang), Kim's spokesperson and inner-circle confidant. She assures the boys that the rumors spread about Supreme Leader aren't true at all, that the citizens have plenty to eat, that Kim is a god who never needs to use the bathroom. Seems legit. They are assigned rooms at the swanky main palace, complete with suspicious guards and tigers roaming the grounds.Dave's visited by Kim (yes, ""Kim,"" and not ""Jong-un"") and taken for a tour of the place - indoor basketball, operational tank, billiards, and a half-dozen scantily clad young ladies, so he become a little more sympathetic toward Kim's situation, which consternates poor Aaron and fouls up the CIA's plans. But there are more surprises in store, and (happily) very little corresponding character growth.It's a enjoyable movie. Bang is appealing, and Rogen is his usual solid (figuratively speaking) self. Franco seems miscast, as his Skylark is almost universally annoying. I don't know if I can pin that all on Franco, but he does have a track record of being a bit of an irritant, so let's say he probably contributed quite a bit to the problem. Matt Damon was among those considered for the role of Dave Skylark, and that may have worked instead (although the comedy may have been too light for Damon's talents). Thankfully, there aren't glaring errors in logic, a sign of tight writing, although some will quibble about what a TV producer actually does (hint: it's not what Aaron does) and about how the North Koreans in the movie often refer to their own country as ""North Korea"" - something that wouldn't really happen in real life, since everyone knows it's the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Remember, the more you see words like ""Democratic"" or ""Republic"" in a nation's name, the less likely it is that the country is either democratic or a republic.The Interview may not have had much of a theatrical run, thanks to threats from North Korea (or purported representatives thereof), but it should do pretty well as a VOD (and later DVD/Blu-ray) release. This isn't a movie you really need to see in a theater, but it should be worth you time on a smaller screen.",The Interview
49,stevendbeard,Stoner Comedy,7,30 December 2014,"I saw ""The Interview"", Seth Rogen-Neighbors, Pineapple Express; James Franco-This is the End, The Green Hornet_2011; Lizzy Caplan-Hot Tub Time Machine, Cloverfield and Randall Park-Neighbors, Larry Crowne.This is the movie that got banned by North Korea. Supposedly, Kim Jong- Un was very upset and was willing to go to war if this movie was released. There was even bomb threats to any theaters that were planning to show the film. There were a few theaters that did show it on Christmas day and the movie was also released on several web sites, so people did get their chance to see it. I'm sure that all this hype did help the box office numbers for the movie and it made me wonder, a little, if maybe the whole thing wasn't planned in the first place-I guess we will never know. Anyway, to the movie. James plays a TV host of a celebrity interview show called Skylark Tonight-think of it as a trashy ET-and Seth is his producer. Seth is wanting to do more serious news stories and word comes in that Randall-Kim-is a big fan of the show. Which is not too far fetched, if you think about it, the real Kim had Dennis Rodman visit his country because he was a fan. The C.I.A. gets wind of the request and thinks this is a good time to use the boys to take out the evil dictator, and they don't mean take him out to dinner. Lizzy plays the agent in charge of the master plan and helps train them, in what little time they have to prepare. Once they meet Randall, James finds a kindred spirit, in that they both have similar daddy issues and both like Katey Perry. James starts thinking that he may not be such a bad guy after all. Can he go through with the mission? Will he see a darker side of the dictator? Quentin Tarantino had a similar situation with Hitler in Inglorious Basterds, and he ended up killing him-remember, these are just movies. There are several cameos and music wise, I remember hearing Wind of Change by Scorpions, besides some Katey Perry stuff. In the opening credits, the Columbia Pictures logo is retro 1960's style-it looks old. After the end credits is a dedication to Digby, a dog featured in the storyline of the movie, but there is no actual scene. It's just a picture of the dog. It's rated ""R"" for language, crude humor, sexual content-including nudity-drug use and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 51 minutes. It's probably a matter of taste, and a lot of it is if you like stoner type humor, but I enjoyed it enough to buy it on DVD.",The Interview

It just wasn't funny. I only laughed one time at the end. Most of the jokes were predictable overused and kind of silly.Of course, the Kim family has been great comedic fodder in the past, as we saw with Team America: World Police skewering Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il. There have been other great satires with political overtones as well. The Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"", Charlie Chaplin's ""Great Dictator"" come to mind.This was just a lot of flatulence and gay jokes. and they weren't funny at all.Honestly, I think this was the worst Comedic misfire since Jerry Lewis made that film about the clown in the Holocaust, and Jerry had the good sense to hid all copies.",The Interview
51,meeza,Not a funny regime in charge here!,7,2 January 2015,"Please don't ban my ""The Interview"" review because of too many pun missiles thrown at you, it's how I roll. The filmmakers of ""The Interview"" should have been questioned a few times during the post-production process of the movie, because there were a few action-oriented preposterous (especially during the film's final act) scenes that should have been nuked. Anyways, just in case you have been living in Planet Mars, ""The Interview"" is about a dumb-witted sensational TV host and his bumbling producer who visit North Korea to interview its ruthless dictator Kim Jon-un. James Franco stars as Dave Skylark, the narcissistic TV show host and Seth Rogen co-stars Aaron Rapaport, the Skylark show's producer. Unfortunately, ""The Interview"" did not produce enough laughs for me to recommend it. Rogen and longtime collaborator Evan Goldberg directed the movie. While they were able to successfully incorporate some relative pop culture in some of the film's best comedic scenes, it was just not enough for me to answer back to ""The Interview"" with positive raves. Franco and Rogen were both in ""over-the-top"" mode, and the film's supporting cast were in the same zone. Now, I don't think you should definitely flee ""The Interview"", but I would not suggest for you to definitely view ""The Interview"" either. **** Average",The Interview
52,drqshadow-reviews,"Though Lowbrow, as Intended, it's Much Better Than I Expected",8,26 January 2015,"Really enjoyable as a mirror to the silly tabloid drama that surrounded its own release. I mean, is there any question how well that worked as a publicity stunt? It's completely stupid, but in a carefree, endearing way that's somehow naive, innocent, profane and pointedly satirical all at the same time. James Franco personally tilts the scale well past the bounds of self-restraint, constantly mugging and deliciously overplaying his part as the sleazy, brain-dead host of a televised celebrity gossip magazine. This, surprisingly, leaves Seth Rogen to play the (mostly) straight man, and for the most part he comes through. I found a lot to snicker about, with one or two really big laughs sprinkled in at good intervals. Franco, the centerpiece, is all or nothing, killing it when his act is on point and failing spectacularly when it isn't. Either way, he's fun to watch. A few gags nudge into the uncomfortable realms of racial taboo, but for the most part it's an equal-opportunity offender, slinging just as much mud at American culture as it does North Korea's cult of personality. Wicked and twisted and sick, with a climactic shot that really has to be seen, I liked it a lot more than I expected to.",The Interview

54,alindsay-al,a great comedy that is hilarious,8,5 January 2015,"This film has seen allot of controversy and I can see why but I think after all that I wanted to see this film even more and I must say this film is really funny. The premise of the film sees James Franco's character a TV host and Seth rogens character his executive go to north Korea to interview the leader Kim jong un. After finding this out the cia hire them to assassinate the leader of north Korea. Both Franco and Rogen are great in this film and their chemistry is out of this world and they're probably the best comedic duo in film. The supporting cast is okay with the cia agent being funny and she is a good character until the film forgets about her in the middle of the film. The guy they got to play Kim jong un does a great job and truly acts how I would imagine him to act in this film. Rogens love interest is an uninteresting part of the film and we could have done without that part of the film. The story is okay with the fact that the Franco and rogen parts rely on the ridiculous premise to really enhance the comedy. However, their were things like the romance that were completely pointless and could have been written out of the film. The script is excellent with the dialogue between rogen and Franco carrying the film and allowing this film to be good. The style works for this film because it relies on the crazy premise to make it great and allowing it too thrive. Overall I think this film is great and despite the controversy is hilarious.",The Interview
55,estebangonzalez10,The Interview (5/10): It's proof that Seth Rogen and James Franco aren't always hilarious together,5,22 January 2015,"""They hate us because they ain't us!""After teaming up successfully in last year's This is the End there were high expectations for Seth Rogen and Evan Golberg's second film. They had the bro- buddy comedy elements entirely right in their apocalyptic film, but this time around I felt some of the jokes miss the target. The problem is that the first time around they basically made fun of themselves and the entire film industry, while now they tried to mix that bro-buddy humor with a political satire focusing on the North Korean government. There are also a few attacks at the way America has handled these interventions internationally which were witty, but for the most part the film felt like it missed on most of the jokes. There were some incredibly funny moments which you know you'll get from Seth Rogen and James Franco because they have such great chemistry together. This is the sixth time they've collaborated together (but really only the third time they've both starred in a film together) and unfortunately this is my least favorite. I still think Pineapple Express is their best work and it was there where they first experimented with the bromantic comedy elements. They've pushed the boundaries over their next films making the bromance seem gayer. An important issue I had with this film revolved around the pacing which after awhile became a little tedious. I did enjoy some aspects of the film and found the segment where Seth Rogen's character is looked down upon for not being a serious producer as a witty comment on his own acting, but he knows what he is good at and sticks with it. There were a lot of doubts whether or not this film would be released in theaters after the North Korean government threatened Sony, but ultimately freedom prevailed. Honestly, I really didn't see what all the fuss was about. It ended up getting more publicity and more people watched the film because of it. Unfortunately it wasn't the best collaboration between Rogen and Franco. I did enjoy some of their scenes together, but I think Randall Park stole the show as President Kim. His scenes with James Franco playing basketball and driving the tank were probably my favorite in the movie. At times the jokes felt repetitive, but the funniest scene of the film for me was the tiger incident with Seth Rogen. Even though I didn't enjoy the film as a whole I did find sporadic scenes working really well for me, so I still had a decent time with this film. The female characters seem to be the weakest link for Rogen and Goldberg's film as neither Diana Bang nor Lizzy Caplan get interesting things to say or do. There are some hilarious cameos however and a lot of pop cultural references (mostly from The Lord of the Rings and Katy Perry lyrics) that work half of the time.",The Interview
56,arthur_tafero,Better Than Average Satire,6,23 March 2020,"THis film falls under good try, but no cigar. THe satire was too broad at times and at other times, the film tries to be meaningful, but fails. There is no doubt that there are several laugh at loud segments, but they are overcome by several not so funny segments. Franco and the other guy (who is really not an actor) do a reasonable job in their roles, and the guy playing Kim is very good. The Korean female lead is a bit predictable, and not that convincing. the film is entertaining, particularly if you are familiar with Asia. But most audiences will just not get it.",The Interview

58,aidanratesmovies,"Stupid and absurd, but quite enjoyable",9,24 March 2020,"Completely absurd in all the right ways, The Interview does a pretty well job at making you laugh, even if the film as a whole does certainly have its flaws. The film is quite over the top, which if you know what it is about, you probably already know. However, some gags in the film seem more forced than others, making it all together less enjoyable than it seems it could be. At its worse, The Interview can seem like a lazy political comedy that relies on gross out humor to play its own game. At its best however, The Interview harnesses its potential, jokes, and all the talent involved, for one truly hilarious ride, which may be ridiculous, but is so in the best of ways. The pacing works quite well, with it always being entertaining throughout, despite some awkward moments. In the end, The Interview is far from a great comedy film, but is certainly worth a watch, and certainly earning of the laughs that it may try too hard to achieve.

60,guisreis,A comedy which best parts perhaps will not be noticed,7,1 January 2015,"The film is OK but is also a bit silly and it wastes its potential to be excellent. The average audience from the United States will probably not notice the movie's greatest merits and will understand its flaws as not a problem, but as a good way to show what really happens. Let me explain it better: North Korean regime is authoritarian, for sure, but very little is known about the country in West, and the film does not do much more than spreading the usual prejudices. At least, the final flaks are basically against the megalomania of the ""great leader"" and the problem of hunger, and both are probably truth, and the film supposes that there are also many Koreans from the South of the border who don't agree on the dictator and want democracy. On the other hand, the most interesting is the way the film shows not Korea, but the United States themselves. The exploitation of media, the invasive foreign policy, CIA's practice of killing inconvenient political leaders from other countries, the widespread ignorance... everything is there. Though, it is perhaps not clear enough, letting the possibility of such flaks not to be noticed by those who are not politically critical yet. Besides all these more important political observations, I can say that this comedy has its good and funny moments, although it does not keep the same level throughout the movie, and gets campy and dark humor in its final part.",The Interview
61,jadepietro,Talk is Cheap,1,30 January 2015,"This film is not recommended.The Interview carries with it enough notoriety that would have placed any routine film in the hall of shame. But this particular film, besides being one of the worst films of 2014, was also the most controversial film of the year. (The far-reaching impact of this film started a barrage of headlines involving censorship, international computer hacking, political fallout, and corporate cowardice by Sony for initially pulling the film from movie theaters before finally releasing it online and still making a profit.) Now Seth Rogen and James Franco make some funny and raunchy films. This isn't one. The sophomoric titillation is there, but the laughs are woefully missing in their latest misadventure. The film's wrong-headed premise, which is more offensive and satirical, involves the fictional assassination of real life dictator, Kim Jong-un. Not quite a laugh riot from the outset.  The inane plot involves two simpletons, handsome Dave Skylark and his producer pal, Aaron Rapaport. Both work on a tabloid television entertainment program and are called to duty when they are set to interview the Korean leader,. Asked to ""take him out"" by the CIA, they bungle their way from one mishap after the next.The dim-witted screenplay by Dan Sterling is filled with absurd situations that never build to anything remotely funny, with non-stop profanity to help pad the film's excessive length. The direction by the tag-team of Evan Goldberg and Mr. Rogen is non-existent. The slapstick is labored, the racial stereotypes frequent and silly, the homophobic humor is appalling, and the jokes are desperately unfunny. Rogen plays the same inept character he has played countless times before and Franco carries his smirks and mugging to new heights. Both actors are utterly charmless in their roles. Only Randall Park as the targeted Korean dictator has some diverting moments. Sporadically amusing bogus interviews with celebrities like Rob Lowe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Eminem are sprinkled throughout the film in order to spoof their public images. The film's hyper climax becomes brutally violent and bereft of any humor. It also makes no logical sense, but neither did the entire movie concept. How Sony ever green-lit this mess is the real major crime inflicted on a nation (or two).Yes, the Koreans had the right idea to object to this dumb film, but not for political reasons for which they so vigorously protested. Most American moviegoers would have solely agreed with them, due to the film's lack of wit and general bad taste. However, if you like movies about boorish Koreans, blatant sex gags, and plenty of anal humor, by all means, see this film. The stupidity of The Interview just left me totally speechless at its sheer awfulness. It did not deserve the hoopla or a release date.

62,Seraphion,A score of 7 is just enough,7,27 December 2014,"Dave Skylark is the host of Skylark Tonight, one of the favorite shows of Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea. His producer Aaron Rapaport contacts the DPRK and they get approval for an interview with the supreme leader after Aaron met with the DPRK's female TV producer Sook. Dave announced this deal so the CIA contacts them to kill Kim Jong Un with a dose of handshake distributed slow poison. They arrive in Pyongyang picked up by Sook. Dave asks the facts of DPRK but Sook answers convincingly, showing a grocery store on the way to Kim's palace. Thinking that the CIA's bag is out of style, Dave brings his own bag to Pyongyang and store the poison dose on a pack of gums. When they arrive at the palace and get searched for the last time, one of Kim's private bodyguard eats the poison gum, not knowing what it is. The CIA resupplies the two with new doses through an air drop, which kills a tiger that is ambushing Aaron while he retrieves the package. But eventually Aaron gets caught by the troops, and before that he has to sneak the package up his butt hole.Kim visits Dave and takes him to have some good time, play some basketball, and even take a joyride on his tank. They also get to share thoughts, feelings and memories so Dave starts to think that Kim is not a bad man. Aaron tries to keep Dave in the track but he states he's out of the mission and will not kill Kim. Aaron tries to do the handshake himself but Dave foils the attempt. That night they are invited to a dinner at a restaurant in town. The slow poison starts to react on Kim's bodyguard and within seconds he's dead, accidentally killing his partner in process. Kim gets infuriated by this and blames the whole world for it and vows to launch his nukes to prove that he's not to be underestimated. Dave is shocked by this so he goes to get some fresh air. Apparently the restaurant sits next to the grocery store they see earlier with Sook. Dave checks it up close and finds that it's all fake inside out. Meanwhile, Aaron had returned to their room in the palace and Sook visits him. Soon Sook and Aaron gets attracted to each other and Sook starts to reveal the truth about DPRK and that she actually hates Kim. Dave comes back and finds the two. And after some explanation, they determine that the best way to defeat Kim is to strip his godly figure in front of his people through the interview.So they go with the plan. Dave starts the interview normally but then he shifts the question into those cornering Kim about his dark memories and inferiority complex. He gets Kim there, making the supreme leader sob on camera and even poop his pants. This makes the people question the leader's godly attribute.The angry Kim then shoots Dave on the chest on camera and leaves him to die. Aaron and Sook hijack the control room from the Kim loyalists. After Sook dispatches the army soldiers, they reunite with Dave who turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. They escape in Kim's tank as the supreme leader chases with a helicopter and the nukes are readying to launch. After some firefight Aaron and Dave fire at the helicopter killing Kim and preventing a nuclear war. They escape while Sook stays behind to make sure the country transitions into a democracy, which it then does.Now I see why the movie stirred up much of the controversy surrounding it. The story is surely a crack out for laughs if we compare it to reality. There is just no way a leader of a nation most notorious for state sponsored terrorism to its own people to just easily accepts an interview request, even if he does actually likes the show that much. What's funny to notice is that I read something in Cinemablend some time ago about the real Kim Jong Un being inconsistent with his father about James Bond. While his father cursed Bond especially Die Another Day for using a North Korean villain, Kim Jong Un instead stated that Bond is a character worthy of a celebration. Surprisingly, this father son inconsistency is portrayed a little bit with the Kim Jong Un's feeling toward the Katy Perry song Firework.The comedy is just plain crazy. It's funny and enjoyable in overall especially if the viewers disregard the notion that the movie actually dishing out on a nuclear capable nation that terrorizes its own people. The comedy still smells of Seth Rogen's signature elements; being mostly logical in building the momentum, inserting those slight stupid yet sunny mishaps to ignite the initial laughs, and then slams the laughter bomb at the climax a few moments later, sometimes with a crazily graphic depiction.Seth Rogen and James Franco acted out their parts adequately for this movie. They played their parts just enough to make the comedies funny and entertaining, although there are spots, especially the one-liners closing up dialogs in action sequences that don't seem to add up to the whole picture. Randall Park really takes his role well, making a convincing enough character amid all the comedy even though without any facial resemblance to the real supreme leader. Diana Bang also adds up nicely to the movie. Her fake accent is a laughter in itself.My verdict for The Interviw (2014) is a score of 7 out of 10. Despite the hype about it triggering the Sony Hacks, terror threats to cinema chains, and Sony eventually chickens out on distributing it to cinemas, I don't really think this movie deserves a score higher than 7. And all those fifty thousand votes in IMDb even before the movie is out is just plain weird, if not stupid.",The Interview

I remembered the incident of the hacking of SONY Pictures, perhaps by North Korea - perhaps not, as I recall; I remembered that the reviews were bad. But I was mildly curious, and Redbox's $1.32 wouldn't break me, so I decided to give it a try.I couldn't get through more than about half of it.James Franco's character is obnoxious past anything I could sit through.

But I Can See Why North Korea Would Not Think So.,7,31 December 2014,"There is a possibility of the whole thing with hacker and Sony pulling the movie from theatres to be a big publicity stunt. Yet again, maybe it was a legit threat. After watching this, I can understand if the threat was legit.Best friends Seth Rogen and James Franco always do mega fun movies together. This is their best one since Pineapple Express back in 2008. They haven't done much together since then, but why get all technical?Why would North Korea not like this? Simple, they make King Jong Un out to be a big baby in a very insulting manner and the Americans speak their minds about him. I don't follow politics or global issues, so I found the movie that much funnier.The trailers give a good description of what the movie is about: Rogen and Franco are in a news team and are going to interview King Jong Un, but are persuaded to assassinate him too. The news team they are a part of conduct very funny interviews, such as the one that has gone viral on Youtube about Eminem coming out of the closet. When they plan out how the assassination goes, it is very exciting. All hell breaks loose with security guards and extreme violence, making more of the movie exciting. There is more suspense and extreme hilarity that make the movie as awesome as can be. There are some good themes and great acting which hoist this at higher levels than many recent comedies.3/4",The Interview
65,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Interview,6,29 December 2014,"The celebrated bromance between actors Seth Rogen and James Franco parlays itself into a fifth movie with 2014's The Interview. And with this thing being screened in only about four to five theaters via the entire state of Illinois, I was lucky enough to be twenty minutes away from one of them in Chicagoland's own Buffalo Grove. So what did I witness? Well, from what was expected, The Interview had ""so stupid, it's funny"" written all over it (the vibe is decidedly more stupid than funny though). What I didn't expect was its gratuitous violence that came off as comical to the audience I sat with. A person's head explodes, someone's brain matter is splattered all over people's clothes, fingers are bitten off, and one of the main characters actually puts a missile up his buttocks (not violent but indeed gratuitous and just flat-out nasty). ""Interview's"" queasy bloodletting reminded me of some of the key sequences in Pulp Fiction. I researched the types of violent images that were featured in that Tarantino Academy Award winner and I found out that what was on screen was labeled hyper-real violence. The Interview towards its last half, had a lot of that going on.Now I can see why this borderline black comedy caused a lot of controversy upon its initial release. After all, its main plot point is about the killing of a real life supreme leader in Kim Jong-un. So just on a whim, I checked IMDb to make sure this vehicle wasn't premiering in North Korea (anytime in the near future). Phew, what a relief. It wasn't.Shot in Vancouver, British Columbia (masquerading as the most dangerous place on Earth), written by Dan Sterling (who's screenplay pretty much allows the actors to say whatever they want), and featuring the caricature of Kim Jong-un coming off as a real nice guy (and sort of humble too), The Interview begins by following the lives of talk show host Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his cautioned producer Aaron Rapoport (played by Seth Rogen who once again possesses a garbled way of delivering lines and a really goofy laugh). They are part of a TV show titled Skylark Tonight and it has successfully reached its 1000th episode. But wait, Rapoport is upset that the show is perceived as trashy and not really newsworthy. The solution: Set up a televised interview with Kim Jong-un, the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This will give Skylark Tonight a chance to be in a more political circle as opposed to just having the host interview Uber-esque celebrities. Oh and it gets better. Skylark and Rapoport get contacted by the CIA and along with getting said interview in the doldrums of N. Korea, have to assassinate Jong-un by way of shaking his hand with a poisoned band aid. Talk about blurring the lines of proper etiquette.Anyway, the bulk of The Interview has star Seth Rogen playing straight man to his best bud Franco. And James Franco's performance literally suggests that he's ""cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs"". His Dave Skylark is a successful wild man and Franco portrays him with the energy of a long- tailed baboon on an all night cocaine binge. There's also Lizzy Caplan who's cute as a button playing CIA agent Lacey. And of course there's Randall Park who really encapsulates the nastily-perceived Kim Jong-un. His character in ""Interview"" likes the music of Katy Perry, playing one on one basketball, and singing Karaoke. Park, with his blubber physique and deadpan hair cut, makes Jong Un come off as pretty likable to say the least. Finally, there's Rogen who along with serving as one of ""Interview's"" two directors (the other being Evan Goldberg), basically plays himself for the umpteenth time. In fact, he does it so often these days that I've gotten to the point where I've just resorted to labeling him a huskier, yet shorter version of Vince Vaughn. Granted, ""Interview"" isn't really a quote unquote, ""Rogen stoner flick"". But it's still Seth Rogen being Seth Rogen and that truly grates on you after a while.Oh and did I forget to mention the cameos that accompany these star actors? Well there are a few of them and they share some pretty faux revelations (just think Neil Patrick Harris playing a straight guy in the Harold and Kumar movies and you'll know what I'm talking about). Eminem on Franco's character's show admits that he's gay, Rob Lowe on the same show reveals to the nation that he's almost totally bald, Joseph Gordon-Levitt goes on Skylark Tonight and lets everyone know that he has a fetish for cats, and this isn't a cameo but a news story in ""Interview"" reveals that Matthew McConaughey is caught having sex with a goat. That's an image better left out of sight and out of mind (totally).In conclusion, everyone who worked on The Interview probably handled it as if it was one big joke. These proceedings don't take themselves seriously and neither should you. If you've seen something along the lines of Stripes or a raunchier, R-rated version of 1985's Spies Like Us, well this is what you're in for. ""Interview"" with its 112 minute running time, is sloppy, not well prepared, and doesn't ask a lot of intelligent questions (kind of like a real life bad interview). But it has a few laughs and a sumptuous look (Canada really appears to pass in scenery as North Korea, impressive) even though it's clearly a juvenile, comedic romp. My rating: A mixed 2 and a half stars. The Interview's Achilles' heel is that it's rushed and not silent enough (sadly, these are even more characteristics of a real life bad interview. Natch!).",The Interview
66,Kingslaay,These type of films are past their shelf date,5,9 August 2020,"I remember all the news around this film, how controversial it was. However once you watch it you see how pitiful and silly it really is. It also made me think of the shelf life of certain types of comedic films. The 80s and 90s gave us Adam Sandler, Chris Rock & also Rob Shneider who peaked in the 90s and early 2000s. The early 2000s then ushered in a new type of comedian with the likes of Seth Rogen, James Franco & Jonah Hill. They starred in over the top but different kind of films that were enjoyable. However whats happened to Adam Sandler's movies is starting to happen to Rogen and Franco. These silly and ridiculous plots with no sense aren't that original anymore. We've all seen a fair bit of them and the mindless fun and novelty has worn off. I am pleased I didn't spend money watching this in theater and saw it on Netflix instead.",The Interview
67,brando647,I Expected More from Rogen & Friends w/ This Awesome Concept,6,3 October 2015,"THE INTERVIEW got the most attention of any Rogen/Goldberg movie ever; inversely, it was also the least satisfying. It's a comedy that's shot like an action thriller, but it never really pulls off either side. I don't hate it but I am pretty disappointed. The filmmakers couldn't have dreamed of the immense hype this movie received with the whole Sony email scandal and North Korean threat response. It was pulled from the nationwide release schedule and, by that point, everyone just had to see this movie. But surprise! It's nowhere near as good as anyone hoped. It's actually pretty tame. In the movie, Seth Rogen is the producer for an immensely popular celebrity interview show hosted by his friend and longtime associate Dave Skylark (James Franco). The show's a massive success and it's entering its tenth year, but Rogen's Aaron Rapaport isn't all that thrilled. He knows his show is shallow and stupid, and he yearns to do something relevant. When it's discovered that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un (Randall Park) is a fan of the show, Rapaport uses it to score a one-on-one interview. Before Aaron and Dave can get too excited about their chance at real journalism, they're approached by CIA Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) and recruited to use their unique opportunity of personal contact with the ruthless leader as an assassination mission. Of course, the two are overwhelmingly inept (this is a Rogen/Goldberg movie, after all) and the plan starts to crumble when Dave befriends the Supreme Leader.The idea of shooting the usual Rogen comedy in the style of a drama or political thriller sounds like a cool idea. I love the thought of the off-kilter, usually juvenile, humor presented without the usual flat lighting and bright colors. In that sense, the movie pulls it off. The content is another story. None of the gags in THE INTERVIEW is up to par with the directors' other work. I love their movies but this isn't on the level. Sorry, guys. Repeating ""They hate us 'cause they ain't us"" doesn't make it any funnier. Which brings me to the character of Dave Skylark. Franco's character was painfully annoying. He's an eccentric, narcissistic moron. He's supposed to be the ""hero"" of the story, the one the audience is rooting for. But he's just too annoying. It's like a cartoon version of his self-deprecating turn from THIS IS THE END (a much, much better movie). In fact, the only one to come out on top would probably be Randall Park, who portrayed the infamous North Korean dictator against expectations. We go in expecting Kim Jong-Un to be a silent, intimidating figure but Park gives us a shy, (seemingly) meek fanboy to Franco's Skylark. He plays up the ""child struggling to live up to his father's legacy"" angle and the two of them bond quickly to become fast friends. Both are used to extreme criticism and both are out to prove themselves. Park's Kim is almost sympathetic, which is probably the biggest accomplishment in THE INTERVIEW.There was an immense amount of hype surrounding this movie before its release but it failed to live up to it. This was no TEAM America. Or even THE DICTATOR. Honestly, you're better off watching either of those two movies instead. THE INTERVIEW is a mediocre comedy that got a boost in publicity from the fact that it had a controversial plot around the murder of an actual, living dictator. I'm pretty surprised it was as underwhelming as it was. I expected more from Rogen and Goldberg. There is nothing inspired about the comedy (i.e. there's a ""shove the contraband up the anus"" scene because of course there is), the main character (?) is unlikeable, and the villain is more interesting than anyone else in the film. It's too serious to be silly and too silly to be serious, floundering somewhere in the middle. I'm not entirely thrilled having paid full-price for it, and I would instead recommend waiting until it makes its inevitable way to Netflix or cable television. It's not a movie you need to devote much attention to and would probably be all right as lazy weekend afternoon entertainment when you just sort of have it playing in the background while you're doing other things. It's an hour and a half of wasted potential (I loved the concept when I first read it) and falls toward the bottom of Rogen and crew's body of work, mostly in part to Franco's annoying ""hero"".",The Interview
68,begob,Good laughs,7,1 January 2015,"Thought this was going to be a stinker, but it's a good comedy with likable characters.Plenty of twists and turns, crude or silly humour (""The tiger's got night vision goggles?""), with some action at the end.The acting was good. Took a while to get used to the interviewer but he turned out very funny. And the dictator was played perfectly.I think they got it right on propaganda and media manipulation, even on the American side, and just focused on characters who were enjoyably complex.The only downside is that some scenes were a bit overwritten Mel Brooks style. There were a few times I thought they missed the full comedy by adding lines. So marked down for that.",The Interview
69,Sergeant_Tibbs,Has its funny moments but a weak followup to This Is The End.,6,6 January 2015,"That was an exciting 2 weeks I guess? When it seemed that any film could be pulled. I knew we would see The Interview before the new year. Anyway, it's better to separate it from the controversy and looking at it as Goldberg and Rogen's followup to the hilarious if flawed This Is The End. It's kind of obvious where they get their inspiration. They watched Breaking Bad and wondered who the biggest person they could kill with ricin could be. Unfortunately The Interview lacks what gave This Is The End charm, a relaxed spontaneity. This feels more fantastical and forced than its arguably sci-fi counterpart and that's not even considering the outrageous aspects, such as the FBI and Kim Jung-Un.The problem is James Franco. I know people complain about him and I like him more than most but he's never been more unbearable. Too much of the film and the problems and obstacles are in his hand and he's just as repugnant as is character. Seth Rogen isn't as endearing as a straight man as he is otherwise. But at least the film has laughs when it tries. They're nothing new, standard Rogen dick jokes and so on, but it's still entertaining. They really need to dial down the montages though, completely unrestrained and irritating. Otherwise it's a solid comedy, not a beacon of freedom of speech or anything, just a nice fantasy if overambitious in scale.6/10",The Interview
70,Screen_Blitz,Funniest movie of the year,7,5 January 2015,"The interview is probably the most controversial movie made in the last several decades, mainly due to the outrage of North Korea and the cyber attack on the Sony company that this movie lead to. Nevertheless, this movie was the funniest movie I've seen this year (or last year) and did not disappoint me one bit. James Franco and Seth Rogen were hilarious as well as Randall Park who plays Kim Jung-on, the dictator that Franco and Rogen's characters are set out to assassinate.Much like Trey Parker and Matt Stone's Team America: World Police, this movie does take advantage of some raunchy humor and dialog. The good part about it however is that is undoubtedly funny and had me laughing countless times. James Franco was the best part of the movie with his hilarious one-liners, especially at the beginning. The scene taking place in the bedroom shortly before Rogen and Franco meet Kim Jung-on was, in my opinion, the funniest as Rogen is outside securing the package while Franco is inside giving orders. Based on the film's humor, I guess its easy to understand while North Korea didn't appreciate this film but this film is still worth the watch, especially if you're a fan of James Franco and Seth Rogen.",The Interview
71,Troy_Campbell,"Amusing, but not hilarious.",6,14 February 2015,"With North Korean officials directly calling on Barack Obama to ban it, and the group behind the Sony hack announcing there would be ""9/11 style attacks"" on any cinema that showed it, publicity for this ostensibly controversial flick couldn't have been greater. That the final product can't live up to the hype is not overly surprising. The Interview is one of those comedies that is rarely dull and consistently amusing, yet struggles to generate any hearty laughs or memorable moments – a priceless Eminem interview aside. After working together multiple times, writer-directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, along with Rogen's on screen sparring partner James Franco, have developed a filmic shorthand together that yields both pros and cons. There's a natural bromantic chemistry between the two stars, whom can seemingly riff off each other as easily as they can breathe, but this familiarity has also started to breed an over-reliance on certain comedic beats. We get the obligatory scene(s) of Rogen's schlub flipping out, the employment of shock-value crude language to spark an otherwise flat gag, and more of the is-Franco-gay? meta humour that ran its course in This is the End. Despite its glaring issues, however, there's still a wild charm to the ambitiousness of it all that – along with a comically violent action-packed finale – keeps a smile on your face from start to finish. Would be even better with a beer or two under your belt though, so waiting for it on DVD is the way to go.",The Interview
72,Pumpkin_Man,A Hilarious Controversial Film Destined to Ignite 'World War 3'!!!,10,22 January 2015,"My friends and I all got together earlier and watched this amazing film. I thought it was great. Definitely my kind of humor. There was never a dull moment. There were tons of jokes that I thought were so hilarious, that I cracked up most of the film. It was controversial, funny, had a decent amount of action, pretty much everything I look for in a movie. It's a darn shame that Kim Jong-un is being a drama queen and forced this instant classic to be taken out of theaters. It definitely deserves more recognition, and I hope it finds its audience on DVD. James Franco and Seth Rogen star as Dave Skylark and Aaron Rapoport. Dave is the host of the talk show Skylark Tonight, interviewing celebrities and getting the latest gossip. After reaching their 1,000th episode, they hear that North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un is a fan and wants to be interviewed on the show, but only in North Korea. Dave and Aaron are soon approached by the CIA and want them to assassinate the supreme leader of North Korea. What follows is a hilarious romp from start to finish that's destined to become a cult classic and nuke your funny bone. With all my heart, I would highly recommend THE INTERVIEW!!!",The Interview

While it's not a cinematic masterpiece, it's a very decent comedy, in line with a lot of most of what Seth Rogen did well. It's entertaining, has some funny moments, some dumb/crass/gory elements that may irk you if you don't like that 'low brow' humor, some inconsistencies in the writing, but again that's typical Seth Rogen gang stuff. Overall entertaining and funny if you like the genre.",The Interview
74,brchthethird,Aims high at multiple satirical targets and mostly hits the mark,8,24 January 2015,"After all of the controversy surrounding the Sony hack and the ""will-they, won't they"" release strategy, was THE INTERVIEW worth all of the fuss? Of course not, it's just a movie. Still, after removing all of the hype, it was still a really good one. It might not hit all of its satirical targets dead-on, but for what it's worth, it did what a comedy is supposed to do and made me laugh. A lot.The basic plot, which probably everyone and their mother is familiar with by now whether or not they've actually seen it, is that Dave Skylark (James Franco) and Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen) have a TV show where they do celebrity interviews/fluff pieces. When they learn that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un is a big fan of the show, they secure an interview with him. When the CIA learns about this, they co-opt Dave and Aaron to kill Kim.First things first, there is a lot more going on in the film than the depiction of the assassination of a current world leader. Early on, when we are introduced to Dave and Aaron, they use that opportunity to take shots at the banality of entertainment news. Not quite original, and they don't really follow through with it later, but it was still good for some laughs. Even before that, the film opens in North Korea during a televised missile launch and a young girl singing death to America and how great North Korea is. This was funny on two levels: First, for the sheer audacity and shock value, and second, because it's frighteningly close to real life. That was probably the best part of the film, but what follows was still extremely entertaining.After Dave and Aaron finally get to North Korea, things slow down a bit as Dave begins to buddy up with Kim and we get to see that he's human like the rest of us. Aside from the opening sequence, this is probably the greatest insight the film has into the way North Korea works. Not just a brutal dictatorship, but also hereditary, the Kims are revered as gods. However, once the illusion of omnipotence is shattered, the North Korean people would probably react the way they do in the film. Destroy his image and humanize him, and they would probably never follow him again, much less look at him in the way they do now. The third act brings things back to the pace of the first act, but still devolves into a standard action climax. As for the much-talked-about death scene, I didn't think it was too special but the choice of music was pretty fitting.When all is said and done, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have made a film which fits in nicely with the type of stuff they've been making for the last 10 years, but it was a little better because the material was more current and had some immediacy to it. There was probably a little more anatomy-based humor than I would have liked, but more jokes hit than missed. Overall, if you're a fan of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's previous work than you'll probably like this. If not, be warned. For me, I laughed my butt off for two hours and had a great time.",The Interview
75,gizmomogwai,The film that sparked cyberwar is not without merit,6,27 December 2014,"Seth Rogen movies are rarely of any interest to me, and under normal circumstances this is something I could have waited to see on Netflix, or with family, not while it's still out in theatres. But few films rarely make mainstream news the way this has- the President of the United States weighed in on this, defending Sony's right to release the film and threatening retaliation for cyberterrorism. North Korea is accused of making terrorist threats against American theatres; the US is accused of destroying the Internet in North Korea. This was worth spending $6.99 to see online, if for no other reason than to support free speech against encroachments of a foreign dictatorship.It turns out it's not half-bad. The bathroom humour is juvenile, sometimes the sex jokes get too juvenile, but this film is not without laughs. Political and journalistic themes are of interest to me, and this movie has something true to say. Kim Jong-un is just a man. There's cultural insensitivity, but much of that is coming out of the stupidity of Franco and Rogen's characters- they badly imitate Asian accents and see Asian women as sex objects, but these are characters who also think you can fight a tiger and want a ""money shot""- political assassination as gore porn. Reference is made to many mistakes is past US foreign policy, and our protagonists stupidly think repeating them is the answer. The North Korean propaganda portrayed at the beginning is truthful to the fact that they talk of destroying the US in real life- but in real life, they objected to this movie.A few other things work in this film, including Eminem poking fun at his own persona (Snopes already had to address this). A rather surprising turn is that the plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un is abandoned with a half-hour of screen time to go- and then they kill him anyway. But the way it's done, with ""Firework"" by Katy Perry, sucks the seriousness out of it.",The Interview
76,maurice_yacowar,Supposed satire of N Korean dictator takes deeper digs at US journalism,7,31 December 2014,"Do you think maybe Kim Jong-Un doesn't have a Canadian sense of humour? This is a primarily Canadian satire. Seth Rogan wrote the story and stars (as Aaron Rapaport) and it was filmed in B.C. But more importantly, its targets are not just the North Korean dictator but American culture, in all its naive simplicity. Canadian comedy is especially tuned to its southern neighbour's follies — it has to be or it would be swamped.Indeed the satire of Kim Jong-Un is the minor aspect. True, the dictator has his godly pretence deflated, in scatological terms, but also in his sentimentalizing. Interviewer Dave Skylark (James Franco) destroys him by bringing him to public tears with memories of their demanding fathers and — what else? — a Katy Perry song about some windbag. Kim finds her music ""empowering."" Though the film alludes to the North Korean peoples' suffering and its brutal, self-indulgent dictator and though its climax does (spoiler alert) blow him up, the political substance stays at the level of an X-rated Mad magazine. It's played for laughs not realistic political discourse. The bulk of the satire is against the American attitude towards politics and entertainment. The Skylark show takes pride in its success at providing what its audience wants. If Rob Lowe admits to baldness, have him on to remove his wig. Have everyone irate when Lowe's confession is cut off in favour of a story about the threat of nuclear attack. The film shows American journalism run like the shallow entertainment industry—pandering to the lowest. Rogan's basic joke is that this film does too. However funny the lines, they express a laddish, puerile titillation. Political strategy is limited to honey potting and dicking. Our unlikely heroes have the familiar Starsky and Hutch — back to Tom and Huck Finn — barely unadmitted bromance. Hence all the butt-hole jokes, including the stash of the CIA 's back-up missile. The guest appearance of real TV news figures confirms the reduction of news to entertainment. Franco is especially effective as the personification of the ignorance in American journalism. He's all the Fox bimbos rolled into one. He thinks Stalin is Stallone. In his stupidity he's helpless before the dictator's palsy manipulation. But the film manipulates its audience the same way, with cheap sentimentality. Especially all his folksiness and American allusions, when the dictator gives Skylark a puppy he wins us over too. The climactic action scenes also send up the American film audience's expectations. For Skylark, ""Kim must die. It's the American way."" But the North Korean heroine prefers a systemic change over that one man's death. The ridiculous plot Skylark initially proposes — a surprise arrival of a SEALS squad with an inflatable motor boat — finally happens. Before that Rapaport and an enemy bite off each other's fingers (digital manipulation?) and particular attention is paid to a tank squashing the soldiers in a jeep. The slow-mo rocket en route to Kim's helicopter points to the aestheticizing of violence in American films since the balletic shoot-up that closed Bonnie and Clyde.The film opens on a sweet little North Korean girl innocently singing a scabrous attack on America (""Die America, please die""). That introduces the military use of sentimentality. Skylark's tagline — ""They hate us cuz they ain't us"" — works both ways. As the dictator admits and the film proves, words can be more violent than weaponry. In emphasizing the Americans' devotion to ignorance and cheap emotion the satire ranges beyond the putative target of North Korea to include America. Too bad Kim Jong-Un couldn't just sit back and enjoy the film over his Chivas Regal, caviar and Havanas, secure that his citizens won't be spoiled by such pleasures. Instead his thin skin and — so far — empty threats only deflate his power image further. For that relief much thanks.",The Interview

78,classicalsteve,Despite Zany Moments and a Few Nearly Unwatchable Scenes It Makes Its Point,7,15 March 2015,"The most controversial film of 2014 is a zany over-the-top comedy which does have an underlying message about totalitarianism. James Franco and Seth Rogen play the interviewer-producer team of a cheesy talk-show which focuses on brainless and trivial issues, such as the gayness of a pop-music star and the baldness of a name actor. James Franco plays Dave Skylark, the star of his own talk-show which makes Ellen DeGeneres appear more like Charlie Rose (PBS) and Terry Gross (NPR). His producer is Aaron Rapaport who convinces celebrities to participate in Skylark's interviews to reveal gossipy truth about themselves. Despite the silliness of Skylark Tonight, it gets high ratings, which is not far from the truth of these kinds of shows in the United States where talk-shows regarding social issues take a back-seat to pop culture. They have fans all over the world, and they find out that non-other-than Kim Jong-un, the Dear Leader of North Korea is a fan.Aaron Rapaport has been desiring to produce more substantive interviews for his talent, Skylark, and contacts the authorities in North Korea. He receives a response and travels to China and back with a proposal from the North Korean regime. They will be allowed to conduct an interview with the Dear Leader, but only on condition that it is conducted in the Dear Leader's private palace and all questions are prescribed in advance. They accept the terms, but before they embark on their trip, they are intercepted by the CIA. The US desires them to assassinate the North Korean leader. The rationalization is that North Korea has nuclear weapons capability, which I believe it does not in real life at this writing.The whole premise is nearly ludicrous: two bumbling entertainment clowns whose only contribution to humanity is trash television assigned to terminate a world leader. What follows is an unbelievable escapade of misadventures as two untrained dim-wits must carry out their mission at the Dear Leader's hidden complex in North Korea. The best acting of the entire film is by Randall Park as Kim Jong-un. When the Dear Leader finally shows up, the film takes a turn for the more-interesting. Park portrays Jong-un as a sentimental and lonely leader who is interested in western pop culture, such as sentimental songs and margaritas. However, there are hints the leader is being deceitful in the presentation he offers of himself to Skylark. At one point, Skylark begins to have doubts about carrying out the mission. On another front, Aaron Rapaport befriends Sook (Diana Bang), the minister of propaganda, who is to give the questions for the interview.Some scenes in this film are so over the top, it was difficult understanding whether the film should be taken seriously or not. Is this zaniness just for the sake of zaniness, like ""It's a Mad Mad Mad World""? Or is there an underlying message to the comedy, like ""Trading Places"" which brought to the fore class and ethnic disparates in western society, particularly the U.S. A few times, the comedy became so silly, the message started getting muddied. Fortunately, I think enough of the underlying point of the film surfaced in between the comedy that it wasn't entirely lost, which it could have been. If this had been my screenplay, I would have let the comedy develop more organically rather than being forced, as it is in the Interview.Still, the Interview does succeed in reminding us about Totalitarian regimes. This is no joke. Totalitarian regimes are cruel, boastful, and opaque. They propagate to their people and the world untruths about their societies when in reality the state serves only an elite class. The real Kim-Jong un is no light-weight. He is a ruthless dictator who arrested his uncle, Jang Sung-taek, for supposedly being party to a counter-revolutionary plot. Some insiders have said suspicion was cast on the uncle when he did not clap ""enthusiastically"" enough for his nephew, the new leader, at government social occasions. The uncle was declared executed by the North Korean state in December, 2013. If North Korea did acquire nuclear weapons, this would be no laughing matter.",The Interview
79,phubbs,The Interview,6,10 February 2015,"And here it is, the movie that almost ended Sony and put the world on a knifes edge...kinda. Actually it merely forced everyone to pretend to care about a movie no one was really bothered about in the first place. Alas the actions of North Korea gave the likes of Seth Rogen and co a massive following for a short period which eventually led to record breaking digital release sales for Sony and a lot of limelight. Yes in the end no one got blown up...no one so far anyway, but many plans got exposed and a few people got humiliated.So what is it? a silly comedy about James Franco and Seth Rogen travelling to North Korea to interview their leader...oh and kill him. Franco plays this slimy, cackling, money and fame obsessed talk show host who interviews celebrities mainly to expose secrets and grab headlines. Rogen is his best friend and the shows producer who...well lets be honest its basically Rogen being Rogen as usual, the man is a live action version of Fozzie Bear, no changes. I gotta be honest I found both of these characters to be rather unpleasant. Franco is genuinely a creepy evil looking guy (the grooming of an under age girl doesn't help) and here he really seems to fit this role too well if you ask me, just unlikable. On the other hand is it ever possible to see Rogen in a movie which doesn't involve him getting blind drunk and half naked in an overnight orgy montage?The best thing about the whole movie is clearly Randall Park as Kim Jong-un who dials in a solid and strangely appealing performance. Now I was pretty sure I was not meant to like the North Korean leader in this movie, pretty sure he and his comrades were kinda the bad guys here. Yet there I was watching the movie and actually liking this guy!! I'm not saying I like the dude in reality but in this story Park plays him with such aplomb its hard not to feel for the guy. Hell I didn't really wanna see him get killed off truth be told, he was way more entertaining than the main duo.Naturally it was pretty obvious that the one big gag would be the minute the two Americans idiots meet Jong-un he would turn out to be a nice guy instead of the monster he's made out to be. Sure enough he's a nice soft spoken guy who swears, has a sweetass collection of super cars, a tank (no surprise), sexy babes on demand, listens to Katy Perry and likes to play basketball. Basically he's a regular guy with a sh*t-tonne of money and power...no biggie (or is he?). That whole angle was in my opinion totally predictable and too easy...but it worked and it makes for some of the best moments in the movie. The clear as day twist in the character towards the end doesn't even require explanation, surely you all know how it will go.Aside from that what else is there? well all the usual stuff you'd expect from a movie with Seth Rogen in it...did I mention the half naked drunken orgy montage? Yep toilet humour aplenty my friends, crapping your pants, vomiting, eating ricin accidentally, shagging one of the female North Korean military officers and having her be a closet raging pervert, smuggling objects in Rogen's ass, biting off fingers, girls with big guns (objectifying women) and eventually an overblown bloody gun battle. Oh and lets not forget the obligatory mystery of whether Rogen is actually laughing, speaking or clearing his throat during scenes, I can't decide.I guess you can call this a political satire but I don't think its that clever. Yes it targets the celebrity obsessed media of our modern age and the stereotypical money hungry moguls that dwell within it, but there's nothing new or clever there. They were doing that with the stereotypical money hungry 80's Wall Street yuppie types back in the day, our era is all about the celebrity infatuation. As for North Korea they don't really satirise the People's Republic but merely parody what they think they know...and like I've said its all very childish and predictable. End of the day, call me a pot stirrer but I can understand to a degree why the North Korean hierarchy objected to the movie and I am still amazed how Rogen and co got away with making it in the first place. Still I also can't help but think Jong-un may well be secretly quite chuffed and flattered by the movie...behind closed doors (gotta uphold the hardass reputation eh). After all he is suppose to be a movie lover and having an adult comedy made about you which isn't actually that bad (making you out to be reasonably sick despite you being a communist dictator) is still pretty cool. I wonder how Putin would react to a similar movie about himself?6/10",The Interview
80,KnightsofNi11,Stupidly hilarious,7,24 January 2015,"Never has a movie in recent years gained so much unexpected publicity from outside events or caused this much of a stir because of its subject matter. If you were living under a rock in December of 2014 and missed it, basically there was a period of time where The Interview was never going to see the light of day because of the hack that crippled Sony, and the threats made by the hackers to attack theaters which showed the movie. It was a long, confusing, and kind of absurd saga that made one question if we weren't living in the contrived world of this comedy. It eventually led to Sony releasing the movie on all the on-demand platforms, and even releasing it into a smaller batch of theaters, an act that somehow became America's greatest triumph over North Korea ever. Weird. But anyways, despite the strangely twisted backstory surrounding this film, I'm going to ignore all of it and just review The Interview at face value. The Interview stars James Franco and Seth Rogen as a TV talk show host and producer, respectively, who get the opportunity to do an exclusive one on one interview with the dear leader of North Korea, Kim-Jong Un. When the CIA gets wind of this they enlist Franco's Dave Skylark to secretly assassinate Un with a ricin strip (Heisenberg anyone?) during their interview. And so begins the most delicate assassination plot to be carried out by the most incompetent assassin ever. There is a certain level of hilarity that also comes with a certain level of stupidity when it comes to James Franco/Seth Rogen collaborations that we're all familiar with. You can expect both in The Interview, but you also get to see what the zany collaborators do with almost 50 million dollars at their disposal. I don't know how much money was spent on that tank, but I do know that every dollar was totally worth it. It could really only be Franco, Rogen, and co-director Evan Goldberg who could pull off a ridiculous comedy event of this magnitude. I'm not saying they got everything right, but it takes a group of unapologetic assholes like these to tackle North Korea like this. Sure the South Park guys did it back in 2004, but that was with puppets which makes it different I guess. It takes a group of guys who take themselves just seriously enough to get the right kind of studio and financial backing in order to intentionally make asses out of themselves for the sake of comedy. That's what happens in The Interview, but as long as I'm laughing I really don't have a problem with it. The Interview is a flick that had me laughing from start to finish. It's so over-the-top and so mercilessly silly that you just have to accept it for what it is and enjoy the ride. Don't be expecting any sophisticated dry humor, and don't wait around for that clever wit. Just sit back and embrace the poop, butt, and dick jokes that fly in from every direction. Instead of swatting them away just bathe in the stupidity. Bathe in the absurdity and before you get angry at the lack of sophistication here, just remember how much you laughed when that Asian woman said ""butthole."" As is to be expected, the James Franco and Seth Rogen bromance is the glue that holds this film together. Rogen actually shows some comedic acting chops here, with impeccable comedic timing and some of the film's most memorable moments and one liners. Franco, however, is in top form as the obnoxious ""how-can-he-be-this-stupid"" manchild. I really wanted to hate his WAY over-the-top persona that is the farthest thing from believable, but the bastard kept making me giggle throughout the whole damn movie. As stupid as everything that came out of his mouth was, my reactionary laughter made me realize that this kind of humor is above no one. I could spend a lot of time here breaking down the plot and character issues that surround The Interview. There are plot holes here big enough to drive a semi through, but to dissect The Interview in those terms would be missing the overall point. This is nonsensical and unabashed comedy that, oddly enough, has a strand of surprisingly poignant satire running through it. It satirizes Western media as much as it does the North Korean government but, at the end of the day its main goal is to make you laugh via dick jokes, and cheer via tank explosions. I did both, so I guess The Interview wins.",The Interview
81,rps-2,A thoroughly dreadful movie,1,24 January 2015,"This film scored a place in history, not because it has any value, but because of the international incident it created. It is absurd without being funny. Quite apart from anything else, it is badly written, terribly acted and poorly photographed. The North Koreans should have let it run without any complaint because it is a greater indictment of Hollywood than of North Korea(even though, unfortunately, it was shot in Canada.)Like many others, I watched it out of curiosity after the recent international hoo-haw. It probably was a deft move by Netflix to get it online as early as they did despite its eminent awfulness. In addition to being a terrible and tasteless movie, it contains endless, needless profanity. (I didn't quite manage to master the F word in Korean despite its endless repetition.

Since the Sony hack in 2014, I felt this film should be shown to American audiences and Rogen should be allowed his free speech.However, Mr. Rogen doesn't feel other films should have the same respect, as he and his pal (the city of) Michael Moore went on twitter to bash the hell out of Clint Eastwood's film American Sniper. How dare he! After so many fought for his film to be released. I don't understand his thought process, maybe cause I use more of my brain than he and Michael Moore combined.Seth, where was all this hatred when Brad Pitt's film Fury was hitting theaters, showing the gruesome side of war in Germany in 1945? Why weren't you and Michael crying then? It's a shame you are an American allowed to have free speech, a freedom awarded to you both by men like Chris Kyle, a sniper who saved countless lives.

83,The_Movie_Cat,"""Your butthole is ironic!""",5,26 December 2014,"A quote that illustrates the general level of humour in this generally likable yet thoroughly mediocre movie. Now it's almost impossible to divide this film from the mountains of free publicity that its attained, it's unfortunate that the controversy surrounding it casts a greater spotlight on what is generally quite a forgettable flick. When a film inspires a Presidential address, it demands an expectation that it can't deliver.James Franco acts an approximation of someone being funny, Rogen's character is slightly annoying and gets in the way, and Randall Park lightly steals the show as Kim Jung-Un. Laughs are moderate albeit predictable, and the scatological nature of much of them begins to pall after some time. The absence of genuine wit is heavily felt, and this isn't a film that can really be described as a satire, more just a broad, dumb movie to sell popcorn. No real attempt to break the mould is given, and no one involved stretches themselves in any way. To watch The Interview isn't to watch some scathing deconstruction of a political regime, but just a few cheap dick jokes dressed up with topical trimmings.The various politics behind the movie, and the fact that seeing it is now regarded in some quarters as a patriotic act, is almost immaterial to the matter at hand. There's lots of issues surrounding this film, from threats to hacks to Presidential addresses, and doubtless more will follow in the weeks to come. But for The Interview itself, it's a film that's gently amusing, largely insulting to its audience's intelligence, and maybe tries just a bit too hard.",The Interview
84,rzajac,Sorta reminds me of Python's Life of Brian,7,27 December 2014,"The Interview has at least one key thing in common with Life of Brian. They both reflect a need for people who assemble boffo stuff to eventually get around to taking on the Big Dogs. With the Python, it was the life of Christ; and with Rogen, it's geopolitics and heavy power.And, en route, both parties manage to hit a few high points. In Brian, the Python boys managed to cleverly address some important stuff; like, that there were scads of apocalyptic ""prophets"" to choose from in Jesus's time, and that the Romans had brought very clever urban planning to yet-another benighted region. And, of course, that unsightly mutations of historical ""fact"" may begin to occur much closer to the actual events than one might like to believe.So, what do Rogen, et.al. hit upon? Besides, that is, ((spoiler!)) the comely state-appointed hostess?For one thing, Franco's over-the-top comedic chops are delightful. And I was delighted to see them plied in service to a timely message for the American media circus, to wit: Thinking that the world can be changed for the better by feeding the American masses faith-/emotion-based tearjerking pablum can only happen in a wacky, zany, vehicle/buddy comedy tidbit movie.Hmmm. Was there something else? Well, not really. The Interview is, actually, a high-production-values, self-indulgent mess: But that's not much of a surprise. Although I do harbor some respect for Rogen and his coterie, he has yet to rise more than a little above mere shock appeal. There are many examples of ""low"" humor that manage to throw out very challenging ideas--of which Life of Brian is a good example. Certain cuts of Bad Santa would also fill that bill.So, what _is_ funny about The Interview? It's interesting that Franco manages to single-handedly provide about 90% of real comedic character chops. I don't follow Franco, but this viewing provides a hint as to why he makes the big bucks. Put the man in front of a camera and he lights up and pays off in silver dollars. It might be worth watching the flick just for that.I give this flick a '7' because, without the production values and Franco, it would have rated a '5' from me.",The Interview

Of course everyone knows that he was a dictator and lived an extravagant lifestyle during his rule. The film states that son is just as bad as the father. Dave Skylark (James Franco) host of the talk show Skylark Tonight along with Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) are sent to Korea for an interview with the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (Randall Park).The main objective of the interview is to assassinate Kim, poisoning him by a transdermal strip laced with ricin via handshake. Dave is chosen to perform this task. Dave spends the day with Kim, who persuades him that he is misunderstood, and they become friends. He is now hesitant to perform the assassination.Watch the film to find out what happens next...The film has a lot of R-rated dialogue, homosexual references, some nudity, usage of recreational drugs(ecstasy) and graphic violence. Again I would not recommend this film for persons under the age of 18. James Franco is the best actor in the film and he is complemented by Seth Rogen, Randall Park, Lizzy Caplan and Diana Bang. The photography, sound effects and comedy is all excellent, but I feel the film resorts to a scape-goat tactic in its portrayal of humor.

86,petarmatic,After they deleted my review two times I have to write it again.,7,8 January 2015,"Well, I finally had a chance to see this film. Actually, I really liked it. Acting was excellent, plot is imagined and executed so cool, and there were many funny gigs. I am so glad they made this film, and I am sorry that North Koreans do not have sense of humor. That shows poverty of their spirit, they are deeply racist society.First I strongly recommend this film for everyone to see, it really is a cool movie.Second I strongly recommend Hollywood to make some more of these political satirical films, they will make a lot of money plus they may do something good for the countries involved.What I wrote below is a text during initial euphoria concerning release of the film. Please do not delete my review of this film any more, we owe it to the victims of terror shooting in Paris. They fought for the freedom of expression and this film is directly related to the issue.Since nobody was able to see this film except few chosen ones I decided to write a review which is also an opinion.Communist dictators are crazy, all dictators are crazy but communist ones especially! It is a good idea to help them fall with a movie! The Dictator (2012) helped Gaddafi fall, so why not use this one to topple Kim Jong Un? North Korean regime is on the brink of falling apart, people there are hungry, oppressed and unhappy, just a little bit is needed to topple worse dictatorship currently available.I totally agree with President Obama. This film should NOT of been pulled away from screenings! I hope we all have a chance to see it soon in the widest screening effort ever! Go Michael Moore!",The Interview

Audiences instantly praised THE INTERVIEW out of protest for the release cancellation triggered by Sony Pictures Entertainment getting hacked.

88,Likes_Ninjas90,"If we had all met our fate over The Interview, war really would be indefensibly senseless",1,11 February 2015,"This is what the world almost turned to hell for? The Interview is the film Kim Jong-un threatened to bomb American cinemas over and which lead North Korea to being suspected of Sony's hacking scandal. It's depressing unfunny and undeserving of its attention. The film is intentionally controversial for its plot concerning a planned assassination of Kim Jong-un. It's also predictably offensive to all demographics and people of good taste. Comedy is subjective and admittedly this isn't my brand of comedy. But will anyone vouch for the movie being clever? Old fashioned comedies are considered prudish today because they never openly relished jokes about bodily functions and sex. Given the sensitivity of the period writers were forced to be clever and hide double entendres beneath the dialogue. People had to think about what was being said and how it was delivered. We don't have to do any work here. The screenplay by Dan Sterling is lowbrow and obnoxious, banking heavily on scatological humour and bodily functions too embarrassing for adolescents to endure. The stars of the film James Franco and Seth Rogen aren't young or stupid. Rogen, thirty-two, is an experienced writer and co-directed the film with Evan Goldberg. They collaborated on Superbad, Pineapple Express and This is the End together. Franco is thirty-six and has an MFA from Columbia University and a PhD from Yale University. Both men endorsed the film by producing it but haven't demanded enough from the undernourished screenplay.Idiots behaving badly are a great staple of comedy but there's no reason to care about either Franco or Rogen's characters. Neither has a backstory and Franco is poorly directed and allowed to run wild. Playing entertainment show host Dave Skylark, he's trying to best Jim Carrey's work from the 90s. But he's so unlikable and charmless because every expression in his face is overdone, like he can't stand being unnoticed for half a scene. Rogen blandly plays depressed producer Aaron Rapaport, who laments not being taken seriously because someone he grew up with is conducting serious interviews on 60 Minutes. These two half-sketches decide they'll gain validation by interviewing Kim Jong-un (Randall Park), a fan of their show Skylark Tonight. The film thinks pop references like Katy Perry, The Lord of the Rings and cameos by Eminem and Rob Lowe are comedy gold. But there aren't enough jokes of its own. The earlier a film draws on a cameo the worse it's going to be and this film opens with Eminem admitting he's gay. The Interview is also an action spy movie and littered with holes. Franco and Rogen are approached by CIA Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) who tells them to assassinate the North Korean leader using a poisonous tape placed on the palm of the hand. This film is not only stupid but has no respect for logic. If the poison works as slowly as it does on a guard, how do they figure they'll be allowed to leave if Kim Jong-un dies on their watch? The North Koreans are expectantly trigger happy and paranoid but also comfortable letting Skylark ride in a tank alone with Kim where he'd be vulnerable. Meanwhile, the CIA has no trouble dropping packages into enemy territory but a tiny piece of tape is their only method for taking out their target. It goes on. It can't even keep trace of its main characters because after a terribly unfunny sequence involving Aaron's rear, Agent Lacey disappears for almost the rest of the movie.The film wastes one potentially good idea. A turning point in the story is how Skylark starts changing his mind and doubts murdering Kim after he's shown a good time. Their friendship is laced with juvenile homoerotic undertones (Kim Jong-un like margaritas and the Katy Perry song ""Firework"") but it holds a bit of our attention as to what choice Skylark will make in the actual interview. Why couldn't the film be more inventive with this idea though? For example, it could have parodied the way basketball player Dennis Rodman has over a long time become a close friend of Kim Jong-un. Imagine if the film pursued this instead of giving us a conventionally mindless last quarter involving violence, explosions, dismembered fingers and a tank ride. The action is typical of the film adding parts to the narrative out of complacency and checklists, not because it cares about them. There's a romance late in the film between Rogen and a female guard but is it valuable to anyone? Ultimately, the film doesn't work because it's lazy and unfunny. Franco is smart but needs good direction like in 127 Hours. He's surrounded by people who've worked together frequently and think they're all funny. Adam Sandler is a good example of why that's a dangerous in Hollywood. Friends, egos and backslapping make everyone too complacent for retakes or rewrites. But as crass as the film is, we survived any major damage from the film. If we had all met our fate over The Interview, war really would be indefensibly senseless.",The Interview

90,MrDHWong,A funny send up of America's view of North Korea and its allies,8,25 December 2015,"The Interview is a comedy film starring James Franco and Seth Rogen which may end up starting a nuclear war with North Korea. I found the movie hilarious, perhaps the 2nd funniest film of 2014 (behind 22 Jump Street). However, I now fully understand why North Korea wants nobody to see it.Dave Skylark (James Franco) is a talk show host known for interviewing various celebrities about their personal lives. One day, Dave and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) manage to land an interview with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un to be broadcast worldwide. Before they leave for the interview in the capital city of Pyongyang, the CIA turn up at their door and recruit the two of them to turn this meeting with the dictator into an assassination mission.The film is pretty much a send up of America's view of North Korea and its allies. The humour is very much in the vein of previous James Franco/Seth Rogen films like Pineapple Express and This Is The End. It's offensive, crude, yet surprisingly topical at the same time. If you don't care for James and Seth's style of comedy, this movie will not change your mind. I personally find them hilarious so I was laughing pretty hard most of the movie.I rate it 7.5/10.",The Interview

92,cliftonofun,"Satire, but not smart satire",3,26 December 2017,"This movie gets a bonus star for exceeding my (extremely low) expectations. There were moments when I actually guffawed, but they were pretty rare. Franco cannot manage this part, and the script cannot manage smart satire. The whole thing devolves pretty quickly into a bad action climax. I don't mind satirizing politics while telling dick jokes, but this movie misses the mark that Team America hit 10 years ago.",The Interview
93,johnnymonsarrat,"The Best Kind of Comedy: Relevant, Uplifting",10,25 December 2014,"Mel Brooks said it best. He's the Jewish comedian who wrote The Producers, the movie and Broadway play that features a Hitler impersonator. He said that some topics are so traumatic that they can only be explored through comedy.In the same way, The Interview takes an important issue of our time and satirizes it without becoming dark. North Korea is essentially a death camp for its millions of citizens, and the main plot focuses on bringing down the dictator a peg or two.To my delight, I not only laughed out loud, but had prolonged laughter where I could not believe what was happening on the screen. The film is not just a satire, it is genuinely funny. You have to expect a certain kind of comedy from Seth Rogen: it's enormously intelligent, yet also full of dick jokes. That contradiction is resolved through the personalities of two best friends, ignoble interviewers, who get the chance to visit North Korea, and then are approached by the CIA to do something noble.There could have been more foreshadowing in the film, for example in the romance subplot and in a build-up to the climax, but otherwise was excellent. The starvation of the North Koreans is satirized but without a dark scene showing the misery, keeping it a comedy. The mission to kill off Kim Jung Il goes awry immediately and the film heads into territory that you will not expect.It would have been easy to make this a fictional dictator, but keeping it real makes the film relevant and even important. Too many people turn their eyes away from this important topic. Not only is a comedy the best way to discuss such the horrors of totalitarianism in a mainstream way, it may be the only way.",The Interview

95,Rickting,The most controversial movie of the decade so far: Does it live up to the hype?,6,19 October 2015,"The reporter and producer from a celebrity tabloid show discover Kim Jong Un wants an interview with them. Before they go to North Korea the CIA ask them to assassinate the dictator. As it quickly becomes apparent, these guys are not very competent assassins. Naturally I was interested to see this. How many movies actually cause an international incident? Not very many. After seeing it, it's truly amazing a silly comedy like this could cause so much trouble. The Interview is a very offensive movie. It just doesn't care about good taste and doesn't hold back especially with its jokes about North Korea. Many will find it vulgar and stupid. Overall, I don't mind this film. It's silly, low, offensive, immature and all over the place with a script that often feels like it was written by an immature bunch of teenagers but it's not just a terrible film which happens to be enjoyable. It's quite well directed and the visuals are fun to look at. The cast does a good job with James Franco actually deciding to not be half asleep for once, while the film has its occasional thought provoking moments and relevant themes.The jokes are hit and miss. Some are funny, some aren't and it never reaches that point where you can't stop laughing but it does have plenty of good moments. Unfortunately due to its crude nature there are moments where it's meant to be funny but just isn't. The movie does go over the top many, many times throughout and it ultimately feels rather silly. It's an entertaining, well written up to a point, well acted and well made comedy but it's certainly not for everyone. Given that it's just a silly time waster of a comedy it's still bizarre that a film like this could cause an international incident and if not for the controversy, this would not have been given as much attention. It improves as it progresses and will entertain many people at least partially. Despite its general stupidity it does go for jokes which aren't obvious and predictable and adds variety and humanity to its jokes. A very watchable if unspectacular diversion.6/10",The Interview
96,DareDevilKid,"Sit Back, Relax, and Let Yyourself Have a Good Laugh",8,3 January 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.9/5 starsThe best comedies provoke and even outrage, and Rogen, Franco and Goldberg certainly succeed on that score. ""The Interview"" is stupid; it's in bad taste; it's even impossible; but Director-duo, Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen's instincts to try anything for giggles and sticking it to dictatorial assholes is worth fighting for. Screw Kim if he can't take a joke.In this action-comedy (and make no mistake it is an action-comedy interspersed with some satirical elements), Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) run the popular celebrity tabloid TV show ""Skylark Tonight."" When they discover that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un is a fan of the show, they land an interview with him in an attempt to legitimize themselves as journalists. As Dave and Aaron prepare to travel to Pyongyang, their plans change when the CIA recruits them, perhaps the two least- qualified men imaginable, to assassinate Kim Jong-un. The movie is as much about friendship and loyalty as it is about killing a foreign leader or even making fun of one - as satire it is very broad; as broad comedy it is surprisingly, and pleasingly, smart; as action it has its fun and exciting moments. The best thing about ""The Interview"" is that it maintains almost a similar level of hilarity as Rogen, Franco, and Goldber's previous collaborations - ""Pineapple Express"" and ""This is the End."", which in itself is reason enough to catch this flick. And, though it may be caught up in turmoil - considering how smart it is about how dumb we can be when pop culture meets politics, that's pretty funny - but it's also a funny, risky and well-done comedy far ahead of most of its studio peers.To sum it all up, ""The Interview"" is a silly, broad, very funny action-comedy about a couple of close male friends who go on a profoundly stupid, albeit extremely entertaining adventure. It also serves as a great reminder why we should never go to war over a Seth Rogen-Evan Goldberg collaboration, but we should go to the Cineplex for one.",The Interview
97,hollywoodshack,Something fishy when you can watch a new film free,5,28 December 2014,"The movie starts out well but gets dragged down too much in the second half with some absurd events. Rogen is allowed outside the high security North Korean leader's palace to pick up another poison strip dropped off by a CIA aircraft. He even hikes in an open field undetected. To make things more ridiculous, 2 of Kim's guards die from the poison and there is still no suspicion of a planned assassination. The SFX at the end are overdone to the point of being cartoons, and underneath it all we're Americans preaching down to evil Kim about two thirds of Koreans starving while he denies it's true. As one reviewer noted, the US also has high defense spending and poverty rates, so why condemn Kim for the same thing? The film even has similarities to Obama when they discuss the impact of a father's early death and what Kim wanted to fulfill in his place, a theme explored in one of Barak's books. Some contrivances were just too much, like Rogen and Franco guarding their puppy dog and using it as their ticket for survival during their escape. The much publicized scene about the killing of Kim was almost completely edited out and it seemed to be moved to a helicopter instead of at the TV interview or another original location. I cannot believe 44 million was invested in this film unless it was for alcohol and illegal drugs. And still the only visible diplomats to North Korea so far are Dennis Rodman and Seth Rogen, a sorry situation indeed.",The Interview
98,TheSquiss,As subtle as a case of year-old gonorrhea & about as funny.,2,12 January 2015,"From the first, accidental viewing of the trailer, I was convinced beyond all doubt not to waste time or money on watching The Interview. No way, no how. From the team (stars Seth Rogen & James Franco, writer and/or directors Evan Goldberg, Dan Sterling and Rogen again) that brought us the execrable This is the End, it looked equally crass and just about as humorous as that stinking 'comedy.' Then came the hacking scandal, the flack, the fallout, the knee jerks and the 'free' publicity that North Korea, the hackers, the cowardly cinema chains and finally the FBI gave Rogan et al. And then I HAD to see it.So? We'll deal with the synopsis of The Interview first, just in case you've been living in a cave for the past month or so. Dave Skylark (James Franco) and Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen) are the star and producer respectively TV gossip show Skylark Tonight. When they discover that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un (Randall Park) loves their show, the chance of a 'respectable' interview looms and they prepare to travel to Pyongyang. Then the CIA recruits them to assassinate the dictator. What could possibly go wrong? With the assassination attempt? Lots. With the film? Pretty much everything.The short version is that The Interview is as subtle as a case of year-old gonorrhea and about as funny. Like This Is the End, it is puerile, ill-conceived, and pointless. There is little semblance of reality and not sufficient fantasy for it to engage. There is no drama, no intrigue, no titillation and, after a careful recount of the laughs between us, my companion and I counted precisely none! Having cast themselves in the lead roles, their friends in cameos (Eminem, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Rob Lowe) and having a budget that allowed them to do pretty much whatever they wanted with it, you'd be justified in expecting something of value. Who'd have thought the best thing about The Interview, other than the end, would be Katy Perry? And she doesn't even appear! Randall Park bears little more than a passing resemblance to the North Korean dictator but that's a great more than can be said for Rogen and Franco's resemblance to talented actors.In hindsight, whilst I wholeheartedly support freedom of speech and expression and defend the right for Rogen et al to make The Interview and for the world to see it, it is very difficult to see exactly what the despots of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were so upset about. Ultimately, it is the USA that comes out of this badly. It is, after all, an American film, staring American talent attempting and failing to satirize with any skill, subtlety or impact.Without wishing to be flippant, after suffering 112 minutes of this tedium, it raises the question of whether Sony saw what a turkey they had on their hands and paid the FBI to create the mother of all marketing campaigns.Now THERE'S a movie worth watching!

99,RevRonster,Not bad...not bad at all...,8,9 January 2015,"While I like Seth Rogen and James Franco and their collaborations together on comedies and while I really wanted to see this film, I was worried that the whole point of this film was to just tick some people off and get other people waving their American flags and talking about how badass 'Murica is. For the most part, it really is that but, additionally, it's also a very funny movie that takes some nice shots at the American media and politics.The only real complaint I had, besides people watching it just because they see it as a way of ""making sure the terrorists don't win"" is the fact that I didn't feel the betrayal that James Franco's character sees from Kim Jung-un was as strong as it could have been. As it stands, it's fine and makes for some funny moments but it could have been stronger and really made the absolutely horrific way that the dictator meets his end have a little more weight to it.That aside, the film is very funny, has some great jokes made at the expense of politics, North Korean, and the popular media, and James Franco and Seth Rogan are, once again, terrific together and really help the film move along with their natural chemistry.",The Interview

If you like Seth Roger, especially when he teams up with his life mate James Franco, than it's a no brainier. The Rogen formula of comedy is all over this joint and if your into his comedy, you'll love the film.The movie did have some action sequences that were very over the top and very impressive. I never think of slap stick comedy when I think of Seth Rogen, but he's actually good at it.But realistically, the flick is not as good as all the free publicity it got, and it was good advertising cause now everyone wanted to see it. However, Seth's political satire is not as good as his satire on religion that fueled the plot of This is the End.

103,PyroSikTh,Enjoyable if you like Rogan/Franco comedies.,7,26 December 2014,"I was fully prepare to be disappointed with this movie. It's garnered a lot of hype recently and for all that to be about nothing would be a big shame. Thing is though, it's a Rogan/Franco comedy. If you've seen the likes of Pineapple Express and This is the End, you know exactly what to expect. The Interview is no different really. The plot is simple yet outrageous; an interview show is invited to North Korea to interview Kim Jong-Un, but the CIA butts in and asks them to assassinate him. Franco and Rogan then blunder around failing to assassinate him and get themselves in ridiculous situations.The single most important element to The Interview is whether or not it's funny. It is. Well, I found it funny any way. The humour is very crude for the most part. There's lots of sexual jokes, lots of gay jokes. I'm not usually a fan of crude humour as I feel it's lazy, but Rogan always manages to write imaginative crude jokes that are genuinely funny. There's also a little bit of slapstick, and a lot of over-the-top B-Movie type humour, especially once the action scenes come in and you're left laughing at the gore. Most of The Interview is, of course, poking fun at Kim Jong-Un though. They paint him up as a closet homosexual with daddy issues, and escalate all the humour around that (Kim's helicopter blowing up in slow motion to the soundtrack of Katy Perry's acoustic version of Firework is priceless, because of all the build-up behind it).With comedies, there isn't really much else to mention. The actors performances all revolve around being funny and delivering the jokes unwaveringly, which The Interview achieves. There usually isn't much else to these movies. However, The Interview does have a bit of visual flair to talk about. It's choice of locations are perfect, making you feel like they're in North Korea. The slow-motion at the end is not only hilarious, but beautiful to watch on a technical level. The production design and costuming is also top-notch, recreating famous scenes from the area, such as the neutral no-man's-land between the borders and the blue huts that sit there. The Interview is a well-shot, well-made movie that makes sure it sticks out from the rest.The biggest problem I had with the movie, however, is Randall Park as Kim Jong-Un. He's a funny guy who brings a much needed gravitas to the role. Thing is, he doesn't remotely look like Kim Jong-Un. I'm pretty certain they could've picked an actor with a better resemblance. The other problem is his accent. He sounds like an American. It almost undermines all the mocking of the character.So there we have it. I have seen The Interview and I wasn't particularly disappointed. It won't rock your socks off, that's guaranteed. It's not even the best Rogan/Franco team-up, but it is pretty funny and a perfectly enjoyable way to waste a couple of hours (if you can get hold of it). I give The Interview a good 7/10.",The Interview
104,MattBrady099,I hope they don't take this review down,5,28 December 2014,"Geez North Korean these no need for violence, it's only a freaking movie. What do you expect from the writer (Seth Rogen) the man who writes dick jokes and other dirty humor in his movies?.The story is about a celebrity talk show host, along with his hit producer, are ready to move on to more ""hard-hitting"" interviews when they score the chance of a lifetime when they are picked to interview the reclusive North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un. But just before they leave, the CIA approaches them in order to carry out an assassination - the two accept, finding themselves the least- qualified hit men ever to take a job.So when Sony got hacked and then cancelled showing the film because their just been treated by North Korean's, that right there pretty much shows how pathetic Sony and the government's of North Korean really is and how easy Sony give up so easily just because they got hate mail from a PSY look a like. When all this was going on... I wanted to see the movie more. I wanted to know what was all the fuss going on. And after seeing the film... it's was okay but nothing worth having a war over, I mean Geez WWIII over a Seth Rogen film.What worked so well in The Interview is the film parody's on the news today. You know the pointless stories that we hear all the time like pointless and uninteresting stories like Miley Cyrus eating food or Brad Pitt taking his children to school, all that stories always say to myself ""Really? that made news ARE YOU KIDDING ME!"", this movie makes fun of that and I'm so happy that it did. Just like South Park that makes fun of movies, news and what's popular today, The Interview dose the same.Seth Rogen and James Franco worked perfectly together in this movie as always. Every time I laugh at a dick joke in a Seth Rogen film it always feels like a guilty pleasure for me, because normally I don't normally laugh at those kind of jokes but Rogen always knows how to get to me. The first act of this film made me laugh me ass off, yeah it was tasteless and wrong but still pretty funny.The second act is when it fell down hill for me. Luckily the third act picked it up for me and saved the film. Most of the film is Franco hanging around with Kim Jong-Un and that's fine but it was more funny with Seth Rogen then Kim.Overall The Interview is a enjoyable Comedy and it's a film not to be taken seriously.

That AND Pres. Obama encouraging the studio not to release the film led to them releasing online (Itunes, Amazon, Netflix, etc..) with only a limited theatrical run. Now that is just sad. The film did recoup about $11 million in online sales, but due to it's budget of $40 million-plus (I think-??), the film lost some major dough.All in all, I enjoyed this comedy about two tabloid journalists (Seth Rogen & James Franco) assigned with assassinating Korean dictator Kim Jong-un (played with delight by Randall Park, who I see is now the dad on TV's ""Fresh Off The Boat""). This film sorta reminds me of something Chevy Chase & Dan Aykroyd would've made in the 1980's-?? I give it only a marginal thumbs-up, however, since the first half I thought was a lot funnier than the second half- other than the scene where Rogen gets his fingers sliced off multiple times! LOLMy issue is of one of the First Amendment. Should the studio have succumbed to pressure from above to not give it the wide release it deserved-??",The Interview
106,abcvision,Freedom Prevails,8,2 January 2015,"One thing for certain, America simply does not like told what to do. We may have our faults but don't point them out and tell us ""no"". The movie ""the Interview"" has been a fascinating mix of twists and turns. With the allege hacking by Sony by the North Koreans, it was pulled from national distribution after these same thugs threaten them. Fortunately independent theaters stepped in and allowed the movie to open up on its intended opening day. I was both curious and wanted to in my own way make a statement for my right to see a bad movie. In Atlanta, the Plaza Theatre was the only house to screen the movie. I got a ticket as soon as it was announced. Good for me because it was sold out on December 25 release. So what is this movie about? A movie that even was the focus of a Presidential press conference. The plot is simple. Two folks that work in pop culture journalism are chosen by the supreme leader Kim Jong-un to stage an interview. Franco plays the interviewer and his producer played by Seth Rogen. The movie delivers what is expected, lots of teenage humor, potty language, and slap stick gag. I went in knowing this and did not take offense. This movie is good for a cheap thrill, but more importantly it personifies our right to consume trash content. But this is at the core of our American pop culture and also our attitude to stand up to oppressive regimes and celebrate freedom.",The Interview
107,ArchonCinemaReviews,Avg comedy with a novel premise. There are laughs but not tons of 'em,6,8 January 2015,"Sony should thank the thoughtful hackers who brought so much publicity and marketing to The Interview that it guaranteed this average comedy to be a smash.This may sound conspiratorial but perhaps the hacking scandal associated with Sony and focusing on The Interview is the newest form of marketing to hit society.James Franco is celebrity tabloid show host Dave Skylark of ""Skylark Tonight"" run by producer Aaron Rapoport, played by Seth Rogen. Rapoport hopes to up the quality meter of his hit news show by reporting real news and not the junk stories that typically garner their viewers. Skylark and Rapoport decide they should interview one of their number one fans, the infamous North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. When North Korea agrees the CIA hopes to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity into Pyongyang and make the trip an assassination.The premise behind The Interview is quite original, and certainly hasn't been done in recent times. Besides that though, everything about the comedy is the exact same as any other Rogen film. Amusing? Sure. But Amazeballs and memorable? Nope, not a chance.James Franco creates an especially ridiculous and engaging character as do the writers of the film in their creative-libertied take on Kim Jong-un. Beyond that there is really very little to say about the film. The Interview is funny but you won't laugh and original but horrendously tired. One thing The Interview is, is underwhelming and forgettable.

They are crass, stupid, with gross out humour and ridiculous characters, which is what makes them so glorious. The Interview has everything you could want and expect. It had me laughing out loud a good few times, and had two really funny characters at its centre.Speaking of the characters, the chemistry between Seth and James is so great. You can tell they have a great time making movies together, and this comes across on screen. James Franco completely steals the show and is easily the funniest thing about the film. His comedic timing, facial expressions, mannerisms were all spot on.The script and plot were absolutely bizarre and ridiculous, which I loved. It had a great pace, and never threatened to take itself too seriously. They knew what they were doing was so out there and were very happy to lean into that in glorious fashion.A fantastic surprise and a thoroughly entertaining film!",The Interview

Having said that the heavy dose of ""South Park""-style absurdest makes for a lightweight funny trifle. The movie features a number of decent gags although one involving Kim Jung Il's love of Katy Perry's ""Firework"" gets stretched well beyond the point where it is still funny. The inclusion of short vignette's within the conceit of DiFranco's character's talk show liven up the proceedings particularly a deadpan cameo from rap star Eminem. Although with so much going on the film does tend to go on and on with a running time in excess of two hours - excessive for a light comedy.

114,EthanBJones_03,So much potential with so little outcome; Wouldn't Recommend,5,21 May 2017,"The Interview was a joint directorial effort between Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen(whom also stars) and stars James Franco and Randall Park. We follow talk show host Dave Skylark(James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rappaport(Seth Rogen) who are tasked by the CIA to assassinate North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un during a meeting. It's is actually sad how good this movie could have been and how mediocre it actually was. It had the setup of a genius satire, which is perfect for the current climate, but had the payoff of that equivalent to the end of 'Batman V Superman'(fight me on that). This movie is very similar to DC V Marvel: Dawn of the Backlash in the fact it had so much potential and so much marketing surrounding it but upon release it was very disappointing and scrutinised all the potential it had. Some jokes hit so if you feel the need to watch it, then I can't say to shouldn't but I don't feel like it contains enough substance to stand on its own two legs.The premise of this movie(while it upsets our supreme leader) is genius and is perfect, especially considering the tension between the USA and North Korea at the time of this review. Even without the current climate, this movie could have been an amazing satire that COULD have stood the test of time. It doesn't and barely stands up and satirical in today's climate. If they maintained the concept that Kim Jong Un is actually a 'sound lad' and a 'playboy', this movie could have been great with a great message. I think it's clever but also foolish how they spell out the movie within the first 30 minutes. Most of the acting was fine and most of the actors tend to have good comedic timing and improvisation. Seth Rogen was arguably the best part of this movie and keeps this movie from total failure. James Franco was really poor in this movie and he just tried to play the stereotypical dumb guy but he came off as just a jerk who just wan't likable. That is a main flaw with this movie; none of the characters are likable. Movies can work with jerk characters as the leads but every character you need to root for must have some redeeming qualities to make a good movie but none of these characters actually contain genuine human characteristics which make you like them. Randall Park was good as Kim Jong Un(although our multi Oscar winning Supreme leader would have done a much better job) and played both sides of his character very well. Diana Bang was fine as Rook.The cinematography was passable: they kept to camera straight(which is all we need in movies these days, right?). The set design was pretty cool and over the top which was nice but the costume design was pretty generic and dull. This movie's primary goal was to make me laugh and it kind of succeeded. I laughed at some jokes in this movie but it wasn't enough to warrant multiple re-watches.In conclusion, this movie has a solid premise and a reasonable cast so it should have been great. It was mildly funny but not to the point whereas it is a must see. If you want to see this movie, then by all means you may get a kick or two out of it but aside from that, I can't say that you need to see this movie.6/10",The Interview

Seth Rogan is a good straight man. And Randall Park is terrific in the role of Kim Jong Unpleasant.The funniest parts of the movie happen early on, with celebrity interviews on the movie's fictional entertainment news show. The cameo by Eminem was hilarious, thanks to Franco's over-the-top reactions and the rapper's surprisingly great deadpan delivery. The cameo by Joseph Gordon Levitt was funny even without a line of dialogue. I wish the whole movie was like that — a goofy, dialogue driven farce about the Fourth Estate, like ""Anchorman"" (2004) or the 1980s' ""Fletch"" movies.Sadly, Franco's wit increasingly takes a back seat to potty humor and seemingly constant sex jokes. It's not that I'm a Puritan or anything  these things just weren't funny, and even started to feel like filler. Then the movie fails remarkably in its final act, with bizarre creative choices by the screenwriters — it turns into slapstick physical farce with (confusingly) a lot of violence, blood and gore. Finger horror? Borrowing a stomach-turning, brutal battle sequence from ""Band of Brothers"" (2001)? Miss Pyongyang? And  a bizarre emotional payoff regarding a rescued puppy? Huh?Whatever.

I admire these guys for everything they do as writers, arttists, comedians and people. I have seen everyone of their films and have mostly loved them. Unfortunately, this is their first mediocre movie.The laughs just aren't frequent or strong enough to make this a successful comedy. Nevertheless there are many and this is definitely an enjoyable time. Ironically, there isn't really much to talk about despite the controversy, that I think is ridiculous, because thee really aren't any layers. It's straightforward, it has its message which isn't in anyway profound, but it is delivered with the heart in the right place, it doesn't have comedy good enough for re-watches or for breakdown, but it has enough for you not to get bored, the leads are as always funny and engaging, but they aren't doing something new or special we haven't seen before. So, that's that unfortunately, had some fun, but there it ended. I will say that ""The Interview"" is a little too long and has very off putting and weird lighting. At the same time is does get somewhat smart at moments and the pop culture references are surely the elements that work best.That's pretty much it.

That miserable SOB Kim Jon Un just turned it into that. As he should be offended since his country doesn't have freedom of speech and I'm sure he's never been criticized in his entire life. I only wish that they made fun of how fat that pathetic little man is, because that's such an easy target and beyond the hair adds to his goofy unthreatening, ungodly appearance. Really a missed opportunity, the fact that he says that he doesn't pee or poop and that he is a God and that he is really fat is too funny. you wonder if because he doesn't have to go to the bathroom that it's still inside of him and that's why he's such a fat piece of crap.",The Interview

Canada stands in for North Korea adequately enough and there's some good support cast, as well as great cameos from Eminem, Rob Lowe & Joseph Gordon-Levitt.The ending has plenty of action/violence and gets a little ridiculous, but there's some really funny moments throughout, with Rogen playing a perfect foil to Franco's over-the-top-ness.

The PBS Frontline North Korea episode was far more damning to the current regime and I've seen more offensive portrayals of world leaders in a Naked Gun film than what is on display here. What is on display here is gross over acting by James Franco and lazy boner and anal penetration jokes. The film does land a few solid laughs, but they're not at the expense of the North Korean regime or usually even stem from the premise, but throwaway gags - like Rogan not packing enough supplies or water in a trip to China. It's the sloppy execution of the film by Rogan and Goldberg and screenwriter Dan Sterling that wrote two uninteresting characters, one of which is nails on the chalkboard annoying and these two dim bulb characters never let the film rise above their sophomoric goofiness.

It's a bawdy, risqué bromance with political satire that is more on the level of Bananas or The Mouse that Roared than Dr Strangelove. I'd put it about even with The Dictator. Randall Park is funny and has great chemistry with James Franco. I think every DPRK citizen should have a chance to view this film, but dropping flash drives and DVDs into the country with helium balloons isn't likely to work.

125,ExpendableMan,A bit like 'Frost/Nixon' but with idiots,6,1 January 2015,"Let's be honest with ourselves here, nobody cared about 'The Interview' six months ago did they? With the likes of 'Exodus: Gods And Kings,' the third instalment in 'The Hobbit' trilogy and 'The Penguins Of Madagascar' coming out in December, the Christmas cinema schedule was packed enough that 'The Interview' could have disappeared without a trace. Seth Rogen and James Franco are famous enough but competing with Dwarfs and the untold spectacle of the red sea parting, it was always going to be lucky to break even.At least until Pyongyang got its knickers in a twist and inadvertently made 'The Interview' into the must-see film of the festive period. You might not catch it in a cinema, but it's on Youtube and all of North Korea's blustering has made this into a guaranteed success. Their threats and rhetoric have done as much for 'The Interview' as Ted and Dougal did for 'The Passion Of Saint Tibulus.' But if this is the film that's going to see all of blasted into little more than shadows on the pavement, it's a bit disappointing. It's funny sure and it passes the six laughs test with ease, but it's not a constant, stomach rupturing laugh riot from start to finish. It makes for an entertaining night in front of the telly and if it wasn't for the fact the psychotic madman on screen is a real person, it wouldn't be more than that. The context of its release is more earth-shattering than the film itself. That being said, 'The Interview' is still a fun trip north of the demilitarised zone. There's a frankly brilliant opening scene where TV presenter Dave Skylark (James Franco) finds a gloriously deadpan Eminem coming out live on air (""I feel like I've been leaving a breadcrumb trail of gayness""), Seth Rogen having an finger-eating brawl with a Korean TV executive and a lot of profanity laced bickering between the two leads.On the downside though, it's not as subversive as it should have been and Seth Rogen still has yet to understand that watching people have a wild party isn't funny. Plus, while the digs at North Korea come thick and fast, there's nothing like the closing speech from 'The Dictator' to really kick them in the teeth. And when things escalate in the final third, it's not because of a death camp or a human rights violation, but because of a grapefruit. Much like the two leads, this feels like a film which is in over its head and doesn't really know what to do. Go in expecting an entertaining Seth Rogen film and you'll have a blast, but it's not the satirical gut-punch that 'Team America' was.",The Interview
126,doorsscorpywag,after the hype nothing to see,2,26 December 2014,"This movie has been without doubt the most hyped up film in the whole history of film with a nuclear power almost threatening Armageddon because of it. Was it worth all the fuss? Not a hope!This laugh an hour so called comedy falls flat on its arce after the first 10 minutes.Kim Jong-il would be laughing in his grave as his turn at comedy Team America was so funny even someone as ronery as he was would have split his sides laughing. Poor old Jong-un gets a squib so damp it would not trouble a fart in a hurricane as far as laughter goes. And to be honest laugh an hour was an aspiration far beyond this pitiful tripe.The plot as we all know was for talk show giant David Skylark (James Franco who seems to be in EVERY movie release of the last couple of years) and his producer and friend Aaron Rappaport (Seth Rogen) to assassinate Mr Kim after securing an interview (hence the title) with him at his palace due to him being Dave's biggest fan. Sexy CIA agent Lacey played by the lovely Lizzy Caplan oversees the operation and we get ready for a thimble full of laughs as we meet Kim Jong-un in his North Korean fortress and the attempt to poison Kim goes 'laughably' wrong due to Dave being a complete idiot . And we get robbed as a thimble is way to big to hold all the laughs mainly because there aren't any.Randall Park who plays Kim Jong‑un is actually the best thing about the film as he, like his dad, is a ronery misunderstood figure who instantly bonds with Dave. But behind the ronery little boy is a nasty dictator and when that is revealed Dave decides to assassinate Kim in his own way.And that's about it really.A comedy without ONE decent laugh is not really worth the high mark it has here. And the hype that America, who does not have that good a record when it comes to ruthless dictators as it's supported more than it's share, has a patriotic duty to watch this crap says more about America than Kim Jong-un. How would they react if Britain made a comedy with Russell Brand being sent by MI6 to assassinate their president? Probably with less humour than the North Koreans. But at least our effort would have some laughs in it.It's not the worst comedy ever made and the three male leads are likable enough in a crazy way but they are not funny. And this movie isn't funny in any way whatsoever.

127,jonathanruano,The Interview -- A Review,4,31 December 2014,"Thanks to the Kim Jong-Un's temper tantrum over Seth Rogen's ""Interview,"" this film got way more publicity than it deserved and it intrigued many people who would otherwise not be caught dead watching any movie with Seth Rogen in it. And truth be told, I fell for the publicity and went on the band waggon. After all, a film about two guys sent in to kill North Korea's dictator is worth a look.For about half of the journey (some 45-50 minutes), I enjoyed myself. The reason was that the terrible movie scenes in this first half were fortunately outnumbered by the scenes that were funny and sometimes hilarious. The tiger scene was brilliant, because I had never seen anything like it before. Then in the last 40-45 minutes, this film became very stupid and left me disgusted and bored in that order. There is this terrible scene where two people bite each other's fingers off. Now who thought that a scene like that would be funny? Any scene with human limbs being torn off belongs in a horror movie, like the first Hostel (which had an identical scene with fingers cut off), and not in a comedy. Suffice it to say, I would be more amused to listen in on the story conferences where the producers agreed that a scene with decapitated fingers would make people laugh. The scenes that came after that were admittedly not that awful, but were still terrible. I think the problem was that Seth Rogen and the other screen writers got innovation fatigue and fell back on the shoot em' up and blow them up real good formulas of a dozen Rambo and Jean Claude Van Damme movies. There is an implausible scene where Seth Rogen and the North Korean girl are in a gun fight with lots of North Korean soldiers armed with machine guns. Yet neither Rogen or the North Korean girl get hit by any bullets, while the North Korean soldiers all get killed. This type of scene was already getting too old in Double Impact (1991) and it seems completely formulaic and ridiculous in 2014. Then came the silly explosions, and the less said about those the better.So what is my final verdict? I personally would give the film thumbs down. Yet unlike the Kim Jong Un regime, I am not going to threaten people who want to watch this film. My suggestion is to rent the film on iTunes (it's not worth buying this movie) and watch the first 50 minutes. That way you will have a few good laughs and be able to avoid those parts of the film that are really bad. The other thing I have to say is that James Franco has the potential to be a great comedic actor. With the aid of a better script and funnier jokes, Franco could be a real sensation (much like Jim Carrey was). What I liked about Franco in particular was that this man does not seem to have any filter. He says whatever comes into his mind. The outcome is that Franco often does not hit his target, but occasionally he scores a home run and is really funny.",The Interview

Then after the accusations of said hack they demanded to co-investigate or else. Things where heating up, North Korea was bringing their army in a state readiness. The keys for the nukes where already in the ignition and all battle-stations manned. WWIII was looming over Western Civilization. The end of mankind was nigh. All this probably happened while Kim was waiting for his copy of the film to arrive (on a Harddisk with a truck coz their internet was down thx to the Yankees). When he did finally see it he came to realize: this is just another stupid Seth Rogen comedy full of fart and f*ck jokes. I'm not wasting my Nukes over this! Soon after they released their statement that they didn't approve of the film's release (or any other future Seth Rogen comedies for that matter) but wouldn't retaliate. The world was safe again. Seriously, if they would have started WWIII over this, I would kill Seth Rogen myself if he somehow would have survived. Look, this 9,9/10 score on IMDb is not a score for the movie itself. It's a reaction to Kim Jong Un's hack and his threats. So let me give this movie a realistic score: 7/10. It's actually not too bad as far as Seth Rogen comedies go, sometimes it was actually funny. Franco plays a retarded news presenter, Rogen plays the straight guy (cfr Pineapple Express). There is some criticism on the American media and it's obsession with fame as well as on suppressing regimes in general. But let's face it: this movie is just entertainment meant to entertain you for 107 mins and it does that fairly well. 'The Interview' wont change your life or the world. It's not a work a cinematic art to be remembered and cherished for years to come. Sony must be thinking they got the best free advertisement for the movie they could have ever dreamed. Now people will want to see it just to know what the fuss was all about. I do agree that people should be able to make any movie they want but in the end even Kim Jong-Un must have cursed himself for making such noise about it. If he just kept quiet it would have been a moderate success, after a few months it would have gone to DVD/BD and after a couple of years few people would have remembered it.

131,fluffset,its funny,7,27 December 2014,"I love this movie because its funny, not so. I keep thinking why North Korean felt offended by this movie because its totally a joke. I know they feel irritated because its obvious that American trying to insult them with this light movie but when I watch this movie with a lot of curiosity I think they shouldn't. Because ""The Interview"" is just like an adult Disney movie, no one need to take it seriously though, not worth a bomb for this. If you like ""Pineapple Express"", ""Knocked Up"",""This is the End"" or any similar stuff from Seth Rogen and his buddy James Franco you will surely like this. A fun movie to watch once in your lifetime. Second time's not works for me anymore. I tried.",The Interview
132,ultramatt2000-1,The Art of Going Too Far,1,5 March 2015,"All those news reports pressured me to see this movie. First off, there have been a lot of cartoons and comedies where dictators get tormented by cartoon characters. Daffy Duck, Popeye and Donald Duck tormented Hitler. The Three Stooges and Red Skeleton poked fun out of Hitler. Popeye fought the Japanese in ""You're a Sap Mr. Jap."" The Animaniacs tortured Sadam Hussein. Cartman from ""South Park"" tortured Osama Bin-Laden. Remember ""Team America: World Police?"" Here it is just taking it too far. They made fun of not only the dictator, but the people and the place. James Franco and Seth Rogen play out as a modern-day Laurel and Hardy with Franco as Laurel and Seth as Hardy. As for the writing, who wrote it? Did the Angry Video Game Nerd and Seth MacFarlane write it? Apart from raunchy profanity and scatological humor, there are a lot gory scenes done in the name of obnoxious frat-boy comedy! This movie is causing quite a stir and caused other ideas to spawn other movies to exploit it Kim Jong-Un. For instance, I heard of this monster movie coming out called ""Kim Jong-Kong"" where Kim Jong-Un's nuclear missile attack failed and the caused him to grow into a giant bound on destroying the world! There is an Indie-Gogo page asking for money. Bottom-line: Animation and film is an art and art is about self-expression or representation of something. In this case this is the art of going too far. Rated R for violence, language, nudity, gore and crude humor!",The Interview
133,asifahsankhan,It's a good comedy. As long as you see it without any kind of resurrections.,7,1 May 2017,"What's not to like about this here? The Comedy? the Bromance? the Franco-Rogen duo? Comedy buddies James Franco and Seth Rogen play the host, Dave Skylark, and producer, Aaron Rapoport, respectively. And in a show called Skylark Tonight, a fictional and popular celebrity news talk show. It just so happens that the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, (played by Randall Park), is a fan of their show. When the CIA learns about Kim's penchant for the TV show, it devises a plan to have Skylark and Rapoport assassinate North Korea's leader.It feels better when you imagine it happening right now in front of you. A real life Comedy duo mixed with a Comic version of ""the most dangerous man on the planet"" right now, and who happens to love ""Firework"" by Katy Perry?Although, the brilliance fades near the end. But still manages to be really entertaining. So I liked it. And would recommend it as a must see for most of you! It's a good comedy. As long as you see it without any kind of resurrections.",The Interview
134,Hallelujah289,"Sometimes funny, but mostly done before",5,15 May 2020,"I enjoyed much of the humor when it came to Kim Jung Un and his love of Katy Perry. The actor there did a great job of making Kim Jung Un kinda both adorable and psychopathic.Whether it was necessary though that they had to portray a real dictator is another matter. I personally feel like it was a smart, ballsy choice, that paid off in terms of the buzz it generated. But unfortunately, the overall end product was a pretty generic and pre-packaged ""Hangover"" style comedy in terms of plot, character, acting, dialogue, editing, and so forth.In terms of entertainment, there is certainly some, but the Korean actors who sound like they can't really speak Korean, and the characters who have the same word choices and speech patterns even though they live countries apart, and the casting of Seth Rogen who doesn't really have a new role to play, was just a lot of poor direction and casting.Still, has some moments of good humor, and higher potential than was ultimately realized by artistic, technical and popular standards.",The Interview
135,danew13,A Masterpiece of Hollywood Hype for a Comedic Turkey,4,26 December 2014,"When I watched the Interview I was hoping for another wacky film such as Pineapple Express or This is the End....Instead what I saw was a masterpiece of Hollywood hype around a rather unfunny and if anything a rather sympathetic look at North Korea.In fact it made me wonder if the entire internet fiasco around this film was actually staged by Sony, and No. Korea may have been truthful in maintaining it had nothing to do with it.From start to finish the Interview isn't very funny at all...I didn't even see much frat boy or toilet humour...it seemed to be about a budding relationship between Kim Jung Un and Dave Skylark. The attempts at jokes seemed to be just plain stupid.There's one type of comedy that is so stupid it actually is very funny such as Dude Where's My Car and Pineapple Express, then there's this where the attempt at seriousness destroys any lame humour.But I must applaud Sony for a masterpiece of hype that will make a box office winner out of Christmas turkey.",The Interview
136,Bruce722,One of the better comedies I've seen in a while.,8,1 January 2015,"The Interview was comedy gold and is definitely worth the price of renting and streaming on the line. The Seth Rogen/James Franco bromance has been hit and miss in the past but this movie was a definite hit. Most of the humor hinges on the absurd and the duo, especially Franco, delivers those scenes flawlessly. I also loved the supporting cast, especially Lizzy Caplan playing the attractive CIA agent and Randall Park doing a marvelous job portraying Kim Jong-un. Overall, while I know this isn't a comedy for everyone, I think a lot of people will be able to find plenty of laughs in the ridiculous plot and even more so in the hilarious way in which it unfolds.",The Interview
137,mrcibubur,Typical disappointing American comedy,4,31 December 2014,"First of all, I would not have watched this film at all except for the hype and controversy at all. Second, I have watched it on a pirated DVD here in Indonesia over the festive period. I certainly would not want to waste my money or my time watching such a movie in a cinema, so I am certainly of the opinion that not only did Sony know from early on that this film would be a 'flop' but they contrived the marketing ploy of pulling it to generate interest.The plus things about the film are in fact, oddly, the little girl singing at the very beginning, the beautiful (Korean? probably not) lady who played Nook, the pure filthy concept of the story-line itself which is actually a very good one but sadly shamefully executed in terms of the script, acting and direction.As usual with most American comedies, they are not funny at all when they try to be satirical and it would take something exceptional from one of the actors to raise the standard above mediocre and create any genuine audience interest over and above that during the actual interview between the two American nuts and the 'Supreme Leader' To be honest, I was not aware that the two Nuts were going to China and then to Korea for any other reason than for the interview. If it was implied early on that they were colluding in a comic way with FBI CIA or other secret service personnel, then it was not apparent to me.Reference was made early on in comparison to 'Frost-Nixon'. No doubt we have all seen the commendable film and are up to speed with the real life interview conducted on which the film was based. Had they (Sony for want of identifying anybody else in the firing line responsible for production) stayed within the limitations of what happened in Frost-Nixon and merely concentrated on that by referencing an assassination but not actually carrying it out in a fictional story, I am in no doubt that the comic and satirical potential of the story could have been more enjoyably and spontaneously exploited in the film.The North Korean 'Supreme Leader' is hardly going to soil his pants real time at this somewhat comic attempt to take the 'mickey' out of him.",The Interview
138,cordenw,I'm lost for words,1,9 February 2015,"It's such a struggle to describe how bad this movie is. Let's start by saying that it can't be watched in one sitting. You have to break up distressing experiences like this into manageable pieces. I would suggest that you take at least a week, with a healing psychologist at your side to help you through recovery periods. It's a mystery to me as to why Rogen has gained any success in this cutthroat industry, he's not funny, he has no talent and all he does is swear, Pacino and DeNiro swear but they do it with style! A kid in grade 10 could write a better script than the garbage that Rogen, Goldberg and Sterling have turned out, it's not just bad, it's disgraceful. Even if the Sony boss hadn't got the chop for the hacking fustercluck, she should have been axed for letting this production go ahead.And now for the negative stuff.....it's a felony to classify it as a comedy, not even an upward curve of my lips! It's got amateurish production quality and terrible acting. Franco just about manages to stave off a death blow to his career but his next time out will have to be a stellar performance. As for Rogen , well he must have an immunity card in his back pocket or some very compromising photos of executives, because nothing else explains his success or survival. Take all copies of the movie, spin it into plastic filament and make some nice fleecies out of it, it'll be a nice gift for my psychologist.",The Interview
139,Jared_Andrews,Funny but Far From a Classic,6,28 October 2019,"The movie's absurdity ascends rapidly and quickly breaks the threshold of practical believability. There is a fair share of scenes that had me laughing out loud, but I could not overlook the ridiculousness of the plot. My lasting thought throughout the film was that these same jokes would have been just as funny in a less outrageous story.
James Franco and Seth Rogen are really funny together here, even though this is not the best work for either of them. The revelation for me was Randall Park. I've seen him in plenty of movies and shows since this movie's release, but at the time, he was a fresh face. The dude is hilarious. He's one of those famous but not super-famous actors who I really enjoy and will consider seeing anything he's in. Michael Pena is another one.
""The Interview"" is funny, but it's completely non-essential. You can catch on Netflix sometime if you're bored, but this is not a movie you need to go out of your way to watch.",The Interview
140,robsta23,Not as Smart a Satire as it Could Have Been,4,18 February 2015,"We open with a North Korean girl singing some pretty crude and ridiculous things about the U.S., and so we know the movie will not be that funny from the start. Though Franco is more suited for comedy than drama (what was with that 127 Hours nomination?) we see from his first scene in the film with Eminem that he is overacting in order to pull off the role of this ridiculous talk-show host (by the way, I may be biased as a huge Eminem fan but this is the funniest scene in the movie, mostly on Eminem's and Rogen's part, and not on Franco's part by any means.) Shortly after we hear the first of a series of many Lord of the Rings references in the film, showing us the comedy will rely on random references or jokes instead of situational comedy. This idea is confirmed as the film progresses and a motif appears about whether or not Kim Jong Un has a butthole.... yeah. In order to create an internal struggle for Dave Skylark, the directors decide to humanize Un and have him bond with Dave in the stupidest ways ever including both of them enjoying Katy Perry and margaritas. Yeah, because I would immediately make best friends with an enemy if they enjoyed Tarantino films. One thing I like is how this film functions as a meta-film as we see spectators watching the titular interview while we are spectators watching the film itself. The interview itself is a good scene where there is a sort of mind battle between Skylark and Un. This film had too much of James Franco's overacting, and I would have liked to see more of Rogen's character, but I enjoyed a laugh every now and then.",The Interview
141,JaydoDre,One of the dumbest movies to hit select theaters nowhere near you.,6,26 December 2014,"The recent political controversy regarding this film will be the only thing to keep it relevant a year from now. The interview spits Katy Perry references, in fact references to a song of hers that was charting back in 2010. It throws a bunch of Lord of the Rings references. ""Haters gonna hate"" is an actual line in this movie! I have not heard that meme in years. This movie already feels irrelevant at the time of its release.The Interview is full of low-brow humour and lazy writing. Prepare for plenty of penis, barf and poop jokes, with a layer of boob and gay jokes on top. If they were at least good it would be acceptable, but while some of the humour works, most of it does not. Sometimes it is not even clear if something is a joke or if the movie just wants to gross you out. You are more likely to laugh at how stupid or suddenly violent something is than at how funny it is. This is a great movie to laugh at rather than with.The story is that a guy who keeps running a trashy tabloid talk show wants to do more serious news and then he and his friend get offered an interview with the leader of North Korea, with the subsequent involvement of the US government. It is not a bad idea for a movie, and frankly, seeing it play out was interesting, although of course it plays out in a really stupid way.Seth Rogen is OK, though not particularly funny. James Franco is the guy who keeps making ridiculous faces and poses. He is the gravitational centre of all the failed humour in this film. He is however also the more animated of the duo and the more entertaining. Together, these two guys do have good chemistry so there is that.Having said all this, is this movie entertaining? Yes, it is. Even though it is dumb, there is something to be said for the entertainment value of laughing at how stupid something is. Some parts in this film did work and the bad parts were bad in an entertaining way. It is also a competently shot movie and has a sensible structure.Because of this, the Interview is the kind of dumb movie that is good to watch with a bunch of your young friends, after several biers.",The Interview
142,datorsiers2,Honeypot,7,22 November 2015,"First of all, you have got to be a fan of the Seth Rogen/James Franco combo and their humour. This is no different than their other films and you should expect the same you saw in movies, such as The Pineapple Express and This Is The End. You either love ""The Interview"" or you hate it, it largely depends on if you like these actors, fans of James Franco will love this movie for sure. I have always liked their positive humour, hence i enjoyed this movie, i don't care about then hundreds of bad reviews, it still is a good comedy. People might say it was kind of forced and produced in a short period of time just to not miss out of the hot topic North Korea and its dictator was during 2014. Of course, it could have been different, the opportunities were endless here, could have had way more awkward and cringy scenes etc. But i don't see why it gets labeled as being horrible and unwatchable by some people. Of course it was not a perfect score, but hey the movie had tons of references and funny bits, i can not take it away from the movie. Maybe it did not live up to the hype it had, since people expected something insanely crazy from it, but i think it was controversial enough. Yes, it was hilarious and worth watching if you like these actors, if you don't then its better to choose something different, because i get that not everybody prefers their humour.",The Interview
143,gilleliath,refreshingly different,7,26 June 2020,"The fact that NK tried to nobble this film only shows that dictatorships don't know when they're on to a good thing: it's actually fairer and more sympathetic to them than anybody could reasonably expect. It's funny too, with a command comic performance from James Franco, although it doesn't quite live up to the fun and games of the first half hour - in fact it's a little too long. The daftest (and saddest) part of a very daft and sad film, is the naïve belief that NK only needs to be 'shown the reality' to see reason and for us all to be friends. How is that working out for the American electorate and Trump? We'll see, but the only belief more foolish than thinking war achieves anything is thinking that reasoning with people achieves anything.",The Interview

Their not out to change the world. They want to and always do make their fans laugh. It's just a comedy and a good one at that. It should have been obvious from the very beginning when one of the most controversial rappers Eminem and then Rob Lowe are part of the satire. Anyway this film has great directing, screenplay, cinematography and COMEDIC acting. Rogen and Franco are the best comedy duo with a clear friendship that exists more than just on film since Newman and Redford. The supporting cast does a fine job as well. I mean what better target to take pop shots at than Jong-un except maybe for our own DT. Its a fun ride with a target that deserves to be ridiculed and laughed upon at the very least. Just enjoy it for what it is, comedy genre. Relax",The Interview
145,opashabms-90700,A great idea and opportunity wasted,5,14 April 2021,I fell in love with the idea of the film when I first watched it as it was the perfect plan to execute a dark comedy - especially after the North Korean government hacked it to get revenge at Sony.

146,abouhelier-r,The Interview,7,1 February 2015,"Dave Skylark and producer Aaron Rapoport run the celebrity tabloid show ""Skylark Tonight"". When they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, they are recruited by the CIA to turn their trip to Pyongyang into an assassination mission.The Interview is directed by Evan Goldberg, Seth Rogen and stars Seth Rogen and James Franco. A huge controversy has been surrounding this film: a comedy movie... with Seth Rogen... Pushing that aside because I'm not here for the controversy. Firstly the best thing about this film is the chemistry between Seth Rogen and James Franco, they're good together, the contrast between the two of them is great as it establishes the movie from the beginning. James Franco knocks out of the part, he may be the funniest I've ever seen him in a movie. He plays a genuinely hilarious idiot in this film, he doesn't have a shred of common sense, he basically acts pretty much like his brother Dave Franco (sorry Dave). Plus, the first act of the movie is pretty funny, then in the middle it gets a little bit less funny with all the CIA/espionage things which were not as entertaining as they actually are; but towards the third act it definitely picks up and becomes more funny again. The writing is really clever and self aware, that's probably why it works so well for the major part of the movie. Moreover this film goes after the US and Korea but also and in my opinion most importantly after the media, depicting a kind of social satire of what headlines are made of; characterise by the opening few scenes with a couple of cameos to back that up. Unfortunately nowadays that's what we see everyday scrolling through the news. This is honestly the only thing this movie ""attacks"" in my eyes.Overall Seth Rogen and James Franco are fantastic together, the comedy is there for a large part, in fact I laughed a lot in this movie. It's surrounded by a completely unnecessary controversy.",The Interview
147,n-kefala,The interview of the century,5,29 July 2015,"I love James Franco as I loved and this movie. I rated with 5 only because I don't like all this sex parodies/jokes and trash talk that I don't think that was appropriate, but you expect them in a Seth Rogen comedy. The movie in general was smart, funny and with quick rhythm. Seth Rogen and Jame Franco, have great chemistry and both of them play very good their roles, as all the other characters. ""The interview"" deals with important issues but with a funny way, that makes you laugh and also think. This movie reminds me of ""Borat"" with Sacha Baron Cohen and makes me happy thinking that Hollywood don't afraid to do that kind of movies.",The Interview
148,Semisonic,Nasty? Yep. Childish? For sure. Excellent hypocrisy marker? Absolutely!,7,18 April 2015,"It's the second time that i get to watch a Seth Rogen's movie that is so controversially accepted by the public, the first one being Neighbors. With Neighbors, the main group of offended people was the family values adepts who were disgruntled by the way the main characters treated their toddler child. Now, it's the political correctness adepts who don't find The Interview proper enough.All those who fall offended by these movies clearly miss - and therefore prove - the point of them. The whole genre of comedy is provocative by default, and with the latest Rogen's works only sky is the limit for that provocation. In case some forgot what it means, provocation is a deliberate abuse of the classic values or dogmas to test the viewer's beliefs and principles or to show that there might be a different way of thinking or a point of view.The story of The Interview is based on debunking the myth surrounding the leader of North Korea. Yes, it's also about killing him and making a lot of penis/anus/poop jokes along the way, but that's not the main point. The main message of the movie is actually ages old and can be expressed with just a few words: things are not always what they seem. In the movie, the main characters try to send this message to the population of North Korea who's denied the basic things in life and tolerates it because the people view their leader as a god instead of a plain immature and selfish dictator he truly is.But at the same time the movie is a self-directed satire that exploits the ugliness of the Western politics and entertainment. But most of it all, it clearly shows that it's the people's demand for that low-level media junk that brings it to existence. And i guess it's just too difficult for some to share that responsibility. After all, it's much more pleasant to consume all the sorts of shallow and empty stuff without admitting it's true nature.Still, it's one thing to be a victim of a brutal dictatorship propaganda, and the other - to fall into the false comfort of self-delusion on your own. In the first case, such people deserve compassion and help. But in the second one - only a bitter and stinging satire of a cure must be administered to wake people up from their inner slumber. So i think that the movie should adopt the Dave Skylark's approach to the criticism and take it as a sign of its own success in revealing to some people their true selves they were so afraid to face. After all, they hate us because they ain't us, right?",The Interview
149,stephendaxter,A funny use of characters bogged down by a CIA operations focus,5,25 December 2014,"The Interview is a film that offered a few good laughs with some really good character chemistry but was let down by the CIA focus of the main plot. The film felt like it had two very distinct sections that almost felt like different movies. The first half of this film had a large focus on the CIA operation whereas the second half had a large focus on the relationship with Kim Jong-un also with some CIA features here and there. Personally i thought that all of the focus on the operation in the first half did offer a few laughs but was brought down by not really allowing Seth Rogan and James Franco's characters to interact as freely. And that is what made the second half much more enjoyable, it allowed Franco and Rogan to interact in the way we are used to seeing them in the other films they have done together. Franco's relationships with both Rogan's character and Kim Jong-un provided us with the highlights of this film even though that section may not have lasted for as long as i had hoped. In the end The Interview had some good character chemistry and a few laughs, but was bogged down by a large, uninteresting focus on the CIA during the first half and once again towards the end. - 4.8",The Interview
150,lediscipledessocrates,Ridiculous and Boring,3,19 January 2015,"The Interview is a boring and markedly shallow movie. The controversy surrounding it is in fact the only interesting aspect about the film. The plot had a lot of potential , but somehow the end result is a lame and obtuse movie that neither succeeds in tickling the audience nor offending it. Stretched out and saggy , the storyline meanders from one loose end to another , finally hitting a dead note for good. The movie neither indulges nor distracts.The screenplay tragically mediocre with stale and lifeless dialogue adding cherry to the foul smelling cake. It seems that the makers and writers of this movie changed their minds after starting the mission and had to somehow utilize the already bough film reels. The actors flatter to deceive. The script in question couldn't have warranted better acting. Having said that, they are responsible for the movie being passably tolerable. While it is not certain as to whether the Sony Studios were hacked, but in retrospect it would have been better had the ""hackers"" actually destroyed the mother copy of the movie file so as to save many unsuspecting victims in the public from the and drawn out sham of a movie.",The Interview
151,stevepat99,Of course it has HUMOR!!!,9,24 January 2015,"Out of the box I am not a fan of Franco/Rogen and I usually disdain toilet humor as an excuse for well written comedy. This film is the exception. Many reviews say zero humor. NOT! They obviously have either not seen the film or they have missed the very first scene where sans Rogen and Franco a beautiful Korean girl sings a song to an audience of hundreds of officials, outdoors, and belts out lyrics that descend from pleasant to 'the shining'. The very first scene has an explosive ending and is comic genius. Sure much toilet humor is ever present so i had to filter that out. Another piece of comedic genius in the best slap stick sense since the Marx brothers has Rogen and a beautiful, horny Korean official where Seth has poison on his palm so that if he touches her she dies. And none of us want that to happen. Hilarious. Toss in some serious action scenes, even blood letting that had me averting my eyes and overall and against my pre-judgment...

Maybe it was all the hype and all the controversy of the film that ruined it for me but I really hope that this isn't the beginning of a downward spiral for Rogen and Franco.I do have to give it one thing; it has beaten Battleship, 21 Jump Street, The Marine and has become my WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!So congratulations!The only reason I would ever watch this again, is if I am being tortured with my eyes sticky taped open.",The Interview
153,jake-law123,Fun if not predictable.,6,28 January 2015,"There's not a whole lot to expect from this. It's Rogen and Franco getting into insane antics on another crazy ride. It makes me feel like they should be in a show about this. It's not as good as Pineapple Express or This is the End, but it's fun for the most part. I predicted a lot of the comedy in it though, like when Franco meets Kim Jong Un, and they become friends, predicted that before he met him. Either way, it had some insanely funny moments.So the plot itself is pretty controversial. Franco plays a TV talk show journalist who, along with his friend, (Seth Rogen) is enlisted to assassinate Kim Jong Un by setting up an interview with him. Like impersonating Kim Jong Un isn't bad enough, they completely make a fool out of him. It's a film with no boundaries, it says whatever it feels. You could say it speaks from the heart, but not quite, maybe with Katy Perry, but that's about it.Even though it raises some good political issues concerning North Korea, it's not enough before action scene palooza. It is a film that Kim Jong Un needs to watch though. If they had touched more on the political side of it without succumbing to endless action scenes, then it'd be a little more fascinating, but like I said, don't expect that from a Rogen/Franco antic party. I will say some action scenes are entertaining and a particular finger biting scene which I thought was the funniest part of the film.Without rambling on, the film gets by, it's funny enough to recommend, but don't expect too much, because like I said, it can get really predictable, especially if you've seen Rogen and Franco's other films, (since they play themselves in everything they're in).",The Interview
154,rprince-832-6294,Honestly hilarious.,6,24 December 2014,"-The Interview, maybe you have heard of it, follows two idiots, played by James Franco and Seth Rogan, who host a talk show, when one day they are invited to interview Kim Jong-un. This prompts the CIA to recruit the two to 'take out' the leader of North Korea.-I was happy to watch The Interview just to support the film industry really, but it turns out that it came with a pretty hilarious film! -The story, mainly the concept, does not wear out like Let's Be Cops, but actually gets better and better.-The pace is pretty good and the film does not waste time. I did feel like one scene dragged, but one out of an entire film is not too bad! -The acting is especially funny with James Franco and Randall Park, who played Kim. However Seth Rogan just played the SAME. FREAKING. CHARACTER. Yeah I hate him. Anyway.-The music was very Tarantino-esque, therefore I loved it.-The film had me laughing right off the bat and, aside from some parts that just weren't funny, was generally hilarious throughout. Even the ending was funny, satisfying, and overall well done.-The biggest negative is the content. It is a Seth Rogan comedy, so it is rated R. It is not that violent and only has some very brief, distant nudity. However, there is a lot of language in the film. There are some pretty iffy jokes, but it's mainly just language throughout that gives it its rating.-So if you don't mind language and are looking for an actually funny film that is entertaining and takes an original concept to great use, The Interview is totally worth seeing in thea- oh wait, nevermind. Well you can rent it on YouTube, to it is worth that! I would honestly give The Interview an 8/10. No joke.",The Interview
155,palavitsinis,Mediocre,6,1 January 2015,"This is a movie that is filled with expected and sometimes inappropriate jokes. It does give out a laugh or two (or some more) but it could have been a really nice film if there were not too many exaggerations. It was overall a pleasant movie to watch to be fair, but this means that for some this could also be a waste of time. The actors gave out nice performances to be honest, but the script was not up to the task if you ask me. It was also too big after the middle, getting more lengthy than needed. I think that it just played with the marketing aspect trying to get some interest in the movie, lacking the effort needed to produce a fine movie. It's one of these cases when the ratings are completely off, mainly because the majority of the voters is among a younger age group, biasing the results.

157,FilmMuscle,American Humor vs. North Korean Dictatorship,6,31 December 2014,"Never has a Hollywood comedy garnered so much controversy—the kind of controversy that's built out of potential international conflicts. Based on credible reports, North Korea (Kim Jong-un) itself was so bothered by the film's premise and content that a devastating cyber- attack rained down on The Interview's distributor, Sony. However, was the quality of this movie actually worth all the hoopla? Well, first of all, no film would ever be worth this much commercial mayhem; The Interview, especially, hardly pretends to be some profound satirical piece that really says anything new about the creepily cultish country that is North Korea. No, it's about a celebrity tabloid talk show host, Dean Skylark (James Franco), and his producer, Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen), who've landed the perfect opportunity to interview one of the world's most notorious figures, Jong-un. As soon as the CIA catches word of this, they well know that they can't miss this once-in- a-lifetime shot at terminating this unequivocal threat to humanity and global politics, and thus arrange for these obnoxious newsmen (the unlikeliest of capable assassins) to be the ones to do it. The end result of this product turns out to be yet another Seth Rogen comedy (with the usual low-brow, vulgar humor) under the guise of this political semi-thriller. On one side, it truly frustrates me that probably the last Hollywood picture we could ever witness about North Korea is just a 2-hour vacuous (mean-spirited) roast on Kim Jong-un. Then again, the degrading material is the callous leader's worst nightmare as it continually humiliates him, exposing the ruthless dictator as an obsessive fan of America's pop culture and an overly tearful baby when it comes to sentimental subjects like the life-long disappointment from his father. None of these demeaning jokes are particularly hard-hitting or original, essentially only basic and filled with the raunchy type of humor expected from Rogen.Now, although Rogen plays himself (or, more accurately, the same character) in every single one of his films, including this one, James Franco invariably brings his acting chops along. His intrinsic charisma, flamboyant personality, and sundry amusing facial expressions help him in absolutely stealing the show here with most of the laughs coming as a result of his comedic, as well as thespian, repertoire. Randall Park, who indelibly portrays Kim Jung-un, is a total comic riot as well—though his exact resemblance to the real ruler is slightly questionable, he undoubtedly wins you over with how he depicts this hysterically solemn (and very likely, more human) fantasy of Jong-un. Although I've never been anywhere close to an enthusiast of Rogen's work, his directorial career alongside Evan Goldberg has certainly been proceeding in a more creative route than I imagined, considering 2013's distinct post-apocalyptic ensemble in This is the End and now a comedy that centers on the assassination of a nation's leader. Vapid humor aside, admittedly, it's still an exceptionally fun ride with the addition of some singularly hilarious, inspired cameo appearances; the film varies from straightforward comedy to espionage thriller to pure action in a consistently entertaining manner. At the same time, the plot of the film is terribly predictable, and the pay-off in the end—after such a unique, dare I say ""ballsy,"" journey—is wholly anti-climactic and blandly conventional. Obviously, Rogen has to give himself a romantic interest in between there, and the typical ingredients for a buddy comedy can all be discovered throughout. From a more personal and informal perspective though, I honestly don't see how one can be bothered by the lack of wit in The Interview and then go on to say that they loved Neighbors, a film with less heart, intelligence, and even more repulsive characters/behavior.",The Interview
158,tinovalkki,just bad,1,27 December 2014,"Making comedy is a hard thing to do well. Especially when we speak about political comedy. You can make political comedy in slap-stick style, if you know how, but then we speak about masterpieces like Charlie Chaplin's Dictator. The Interview won't get even near to that. All that bad humor may make you laugh if you are six years old, but normal audience even with a little sense of humor this is more like an insult. I wonder how they got James Franco and Seth Rogen to get involved with this. Just reading a script would keep any actor avoiding this kind of garbage. Maybe they have some terns of agreement with Sony Pictures which obligates them to do something like this between real projects, I wonder. All the speak about hacking Sony Pictures must be some panic marketing after getting evaluation of test audience screening just to maximize the profit out of it. Not even the government of North-Korea could be so stupid to make such efforts. I wonder how they got President Obama involved this marketing campaign? Maybe he got few Sony Pictures shares in his pocket. I am not a huge fan of comedy, but even slap-stick humor can make with some style.

Randall Park a hysterical Kim Jong Un. Diana Bang lives up to her name as Sook. Query: Is this the first combination gross-out comedy and political satire? It's not really a satire about the reprehensible DPRK, but it IS about the way Americans, and probably the rest of the world, euthanize themselves by wallowing in ""celebrity""news, while there is a place in the world, run by an evil clown, where people who speak out are sentenced to death and their children and children's children are sentenced to work camps.

161,jakob13,An unsophisticated and arrogant fantasy made in the USA,1,12 January 2015,"Much has been said about 'The Interview', a B film with little social value. It ignited a firestorm of fear that sent Sony's Columbia Pictures on French leave, Obama criticized the Studio for caving into threats from North Korea for its depicted of Kim Jong-un. And then came the stampede of angry feet in the press that Sony abandoned the sacred American protection of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The Rogen-Greenberg script took as its stock idea Dennis Rodman's trip to Pyongyang and his breakthrough moment of his budding friendship with Kim Jong-un, an avid basketball fan. The comedy team turned this conceit into a plot to bring down the North Korean regime by two clueless Americans--a vain and vacuous TV reality show host post (James Franco) and his producer (Seth Rogen), enlisted by the CIA to assassinate Kim. What transpires is sheer Hollywood fantasy enveloped in marijuana fumes and buoyed by silly boner, fart and school-boy sexual jokes. 'The Interview' is not all that worthless: it does spoof America media, dismissing it as nothing more serious than bread and circuses. It also tells a truth which is absent from the US corporate media that goes well over the head of a sheep-like American public: in talking up Gulags, Kim says the US has a widespread of Gulaps called prisons that mainly house its Blacks and Brown citizens, and as for the charge of starving his own people, the North Korean leaders plainly makes the case that the US and its allies have deliberately denied North Korea of food aid. More damning still is the unmitigated arrogance that two mindless, unsophisticated and ignorant American men child can bring down an enemy government of the US. As such, once again, the film re-enforces a tired banality that America is God's gift to democracy and freedom, a paragon of virtue bereft of intelligence, given to gratuitous violence, following the belief that it follows no norm or belief other than its own.",The Interview

So I think that North Korean ladies and American men should first become friends, before having sex with each other - so that their mutual affection for each other can blossom and evolve into a meaningful and loving relationship :)It should also be noted, that since the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a member states of the United Nations, the current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, has a moral and legal responsibility to uphold the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in the land - and finally implement a peace treaty between the two Koreas, so that peace and harmony can prevail in the International Community.Also, Russia's Embassy in North Korea said diplomats in the country are facing an acute shortage of essential goods sparked by coronavirus restrictions and noted an ongoing exodus of foreign diplomats from the isolated country.""Leaving the North Korean capital can be understood since not everyone can withstand the unprecedented severity of total restrictions, acute shortage of essential goods including medicines, and lack of opportunities to treat health issues,"" the Russian Embassy's statement said recently, adding that some of its staff have left as there have been ""many problems.""So it's very important that diplomatic bonds - as well as romantic ties - evolve and grow between Korea and America, so that peace and prosperity can finally be manifested in the world - as indicated in this very fine film.",The Interview

Brilliant script.,10,29 January 2015,"OK, this can be considered sophomoric and crass humor, but the fact is The Inteview is the funniest, bravest and most entertaining comedy I've seen in ages. It's up there with the darkest satires like Fail Safe and Doctor Strangelove. It has elements of National Lampoon's classics as well. I haven't laughed so much in a movie since South Park: Bigger Longer and Uncut. That probably dismisses my opinion in the minds of many but I don't care.

No need to go into details about the plot as the trailer is pretty self explanatory as well as the political view about it.I personally felt that Franco tried too hard to be funny with some of the lines he delivers. I can only assume some of it was improvised, but I would bet good money on it. I laughed loudly at some jokes and didn't react to many jokes. The film as a whole wasn't very interesting with some violence that really didn't need to be there.Maybe with all of the controversy leading up to this film I had high expectations and because of that, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have.

165,MattBirk,The Interview: Battle of the Five Armies,7,31 December 2014,"So was The Interview the best comedy of all time, or even the best comedy of the year? Sadly no, it's not even Seth Rogen and James Franco's best collaboration, that title goes to Pineapple Express. The movie does have some very solid comedy bits that are very original, but the overall film itself lacked excitement and unpredictability. It was pretty clear that one of the main characters would get caught up in Kim's manipulation, only to come to his senses at the end of the film, just in time to be claimed a hero. If you haven't seen the movie, you could easily guess the type of route the writers went when choosing to portray Kim's personality, super fluffy and soft. But other than a pretty straightforward storyline, my only other true complaint is that the movie is extremely vulgar. Just like Dumb and Dumber To and Neighbors, which came out earlier this year, the amount of jokes involving sex or genitalia is through the roof. Do the writers really think this is funny? I'm not arguing if it's acceptable or not, I'm just trying to say those types of jokes are used so much in the movie that it becomes overkill. But other than those complaints, The Interview has quite a bit of good humor, I've always been a fan of the two lead actors and this movie is no different. Though I do think that when James Franco plays a more likable character, the overall movie is better (like Pineapple Express), here however, his character is a complete douche and the movie sort of suffers. But somehow they make it work, their chemistry and improv skills are as sound as ever, and though their banter is pretty scattershot, most jokes hit their mark.

I only watched it because I had to see just what sort of film could annoy the Kims more than Team America. Having seen it, I felt like taking ""merciless"" action against the filmmakers too. It isn't clever, thought-provoking or even funny (save the 45 second song at the beginning, which was pretty hilarious). It's simply vulgar, offensive and totally stupid. It seems to make no effort to try and create satire on any level, and instead makes plenty of room for Seth Rogen making jokes about buttholes, Seth Rogen being slapped about in ""comedy"" sex scenes and Seth Rogen wiggling his belly and his genitals at the viewer.

167,Suradit,Abbott and Costello at their worst,2,30 December 2014,"I've never thought Seth Rogan was even marginally funny. This simply confirms it. James Franco really ought to distance himself from Rogan before he is saddled further with material like this and with a partnership that makes Abbot & Costello or the Three Stooges look like comedic geniuses by comparison. Franco was equally bad in this, but he seems to possess some talent if he ever finds a vehicle to demonstrate it before he's reduced to B films and walk-on parts in short-lived sitcoms.What I assume is supposed to pass for humor is just childish attempts to talk about boners and to make giggling references to Asian words or accents. I have to believe that the supposed hacking and threats from North Korea were just some sort of publicity stunt to raise interest in a movie that would have quickly died after its release in theaters. If anything this movie demonstrates how pathetic Hollywood has become and calls into question the intelligence of anyone who found it amusing.A total waste of 1 ½ hours of my life  I walked away before it ended, but whatever I missed could never have rescued this nonsense.

There wasn't that one scene that everyone will remember or that one clever line that will be quoted 10 years from now. It's all very mediocre. James Franco actually hurt this movie in the long run I think. He was funny in Pineapple Express, but here he overdoes it. His character is just too stupid. It becomes really annoying and unbelievable. The movie was too long as well.It did not need to be 2 hours.

Arguably the worst, unfunniest comedy every made but must-see material merely for the subject matter -- a total put down of fat young dictator KIM Jung-Eun of North Korea, head of the only purely StalinIst regime left in the world. In December it aroused North Korea to declare cyber war on production company SONY and stirred up such an international controversy that it was temporarily pulled Sent from my iPad A perfect example of the principle that there's no such thing as Bad Publicity. The Korean attempt to strangle the film backfired and far more people turned out to see this merciless but tasteless satire of a horrible world leader in early 2015 than would have otherwise. About as subtle as a train wreck this is no ""Great Dictator"" by country mile. The comedy is simply unfunny, not even by the standards of outrageous Bad Taste (Such as Pink Flamingos). For the record: Co-directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, both 32 and both Canadians Vancouver, B.C. Rogen is from a Stand up comedy background and will soon appear as Steve Wozniak in the new Steve Jobs biopic directed by Slumdog Millionaire helmer Danny Boyle. As for the plot, if you can call it that: Dave Skylark (James Franco) and producer Aaron Rapoport (Rogen) run a ridiculous failing celebrity interview .show ""Skylark Tonight"" which is about to go under. When by a quirk of fate they suddenly land an interview with surprise fan, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-eun, things start looking up. An interview, with the notorious dictator would be a gigantic feather in their flopping hats and put them back in business. However, they are more or less forced into service by the CIA to turn their trip to Pyongyang into an assassination mission. The dialog and bickering between them along the way is worse than jr. High school boys room garbage mouth drivel -- not even bad, just stupid and completely unfunny --nary a single chuckle. The big thing, however, is to see how Kim will be portrayed. The actor who does the honors is Los Angeles based Korean-American actor Randall Park, who plays it as if Kim speaks perfect American schoolyard English and turns out to be a jovial host. The physical resemblance is at best superficial with only the hoaky hairdo producing a vague resemblance to the actual Kim. Interestingly, Kim is known to be somewhat of a fan of NBA basketball and has invited ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman to Pyongyang on two occasions giving him the red carpet treatment each time. After gaining Kim's confidence and being befriended by him they find out that there are all kinds of horrendous atrocities going on in the country behind his smiling facade, whereupon they decide to carry out the mission but, Needless to say, they flub the dub and barely get back out alive When I ambled out of the Champs Élysées cinema in Paris where I paid top dollar (in uros) to see it I felt like I had just sat through the absolute worst piece of cinematic crap I have ever seen in my life. At the same time, however, I felt that I had somehow fulfilled my duty as a patriotic American citizen support our right to freedom of speech in the face of Communist attack, and done my duty as a film critic even if there was nothing to criticize. I may have to go back one of these days to see it again just to see if it was really as bad as I thought it was, or if there are maybe some redeeming features that passed me by. I love GOOD Bad Taste movies like the Divine films of John Waters but this was simply zippetty-doodah and flush after using.On the positive side, co-director Evan Goldberg is in record as stating: (on his controversial comedy 'The Interview') ""Obviously we knew North Koreans might not love every minute of it. To us, it's like a big silly movie more than anything. I don't think anybody should get bogged down thinking it's a political movie, because it's not"".Well, bigtime silly it certainly is, but as far as having political values -- just see it and draw your own conclusions.

170,TheSeaLion,I thought it was going to be worse,5,25 December 2014,"""The Interview"" is a movie that when I heard about it, I had no intention of watching it. I had been turned off by Rogen's other films ""This is the End"" and the even worse ""Neighbors"", so when I saw that it was another one of his movies I decided I would give it a pass. After the controversy with this film I felt like I was obligated to an extent to watch this movie, so I did. While I would not call it funny and found it to be a pretty generic and bland movie, it exceeded my expectations that had been established by ""This is the End"" and ""Neighbors"".Dave Skylar (James Franco) is the host of an entertainment news show, which turns out to be one of Kim Jong-un's (Randall Park) favorite shows. Dave's producer Aaron (Seth Rogen) scores an interview with the leader of North Korea and the two are soon recruited by the C.I.A to pull off an assassination on Kim. After arriving, Dave begins to form a friendship with Kim, putting the entire mission in jeopardy.The biggest problem with this movie is that it isn't very funny. There are some mildly amusing moments in the film, but those moments are only funny the first time you watch them. A lot of the jokes in the movie rely on pop cultural references like Dave and Kim listening to Katy Perry's song ""Firework"" or Dave making several ""Lord of the Rings"" references at different points of the film. There are also a lot of times that an unfunny joke is carried on and on, making it less funny than it started out. I will give the movie credit that the seemingly dumb jokes like the Katy Perry joke were one-off jokes, but then it's incorporated later in the movie. However, that does not dismiss that they weren't funny.The best part of the movie is the interview scene for some reasons that genuinely surprised me. Like I said, the scene reincorporated earlier jokes, there was some actual tension and James Franco and Randall Park both gave very good performances. I would say the only downside to the scene is when it cuts back to Aaron and Sook (Diana Bang) in the control room, fighting off the crew in there to keep the interview going.""The Interview"" is a movie that left me pleasantly surprised, but I will never watch it again. Had it not been for the controversy surrounding it, the movie would most likely have been forgotten after a few months.

When they discover that Kim is a fan of their show, they plan to interview him. But the CIA has other plans giving them a undercover mission to assassinate Kim as they interview him. Now our two lunatics will create comical situations with some action scenes in the climax to make us laugh.Unfortunately 'The Interview' never rises above the juvenile level it sets.While there are some genuine laughs time to time, specially I liked the couple 'Lord of the Rings' references. Still there is no serious attempt to deliver well-based satirical message by the end of this silly ride. There is a lot of forced violence and juvenile attempts at physical humor. Not much depth is given to the actual situation in North Korea which is the main reason why the mission is undertaken. The story just feels like 'He is bad, lets kill him'.

Look it up.The ill-conceived concept of making a ""comedy"" film about assassinating a touchy world leader is a loser from the get-go. Why wouldn't North Korea or any country be outraged at the idea?

173,Kicino,Stupid comedy based on sloppy research: big disappointment,4,1 January 2015,"North Korea, let alone the hacking of Sony site and pulling out from theater release in Christmas, is probably just a gimmick for this stupid comedy. I am more disappointed than I expected since I have always wanted to know more about North Korea and thought it would be a brilliant idea to show a tragic and unbelievable place in a witty, cynical and yet factual way. Yet with excessive and poor taste of comical sex and violence, the Interview feels like a third rate low budget comedy. The acting, especially James Franco, is so bad and exaggerating that I wanted to leave midway. But what kills it is the superficial portrayal of North Korea: other than the famine that leaves millions of North Koreans starving, its Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un is a liar, and the propaganda glorifies him like a God. That's about it. In an effort to show how flimsy the research is and how patronizing American culture (as delivered by the producers) is, Kim is portrayed with superb skills in basketball, loves drinking and chicks and collecting cars, including tanks. What about his abuse of power by putting anyone against him in prison or death? What about the Juche idea? The Kim dynasty? And how the western aid all go to the military? And the black market and inventive ways people looking for food? What about the extent to which North Koreans are willing to suffer to escape from their country? How they fakes tears when their leader died and how they spy on neighbors? Or how modeled or staged Pyongyang is (like The Truman Show) for foreign visitors? Or about how they make fun of the imperial west and corrupted South Korea? It could have been so hilarious if we show these elements rather than sex and violence which we can see in any other comedies. If the researchers for this movie could have dug a little deeper about this reclusive country, this could have been developed into something so much more informative and entertaining while ridiculous and hilarious. Even the Dictator is slightly better. But we ended up having is just very limited and recited facts of the famine stats and a moody leader. I am angry and disappointed, not because they make fun of North Korea, but because they have missed the golden opportunity which has so much potential to sneer at western and totalitarian politics. And President Obama may eventually feel he has become part of the clowning act to be conned into publicizing this movie in the name of terrorism or cyberbully or breach of speech freedom.

174,drawlife,A step back for Rogen and Franco.,5,6 February 2015,"Aside from the massive controversy surrounding this movie, I am just going to be talking about the film and the film only. I really enjoyed This is the End. I thought it was very smart, and very innovative. It's one of the most tasteless and ridiculous comedies I've ever seen. The Interview does not match up, and it was kinda expected. I personally didn't think it would be easy at all for Rogen to follow up on This is the End. I liked Seth Rogen in this film, I liked his character being the most level-headed out of anyone, and I liked his little romance he had with Diana Bang's Sook Young Park. James Franco however, has not been more unbearable. His performance is so over the top. It's very unbearable, until maybe the third act or so. I enjoyed the relationship his character had with Kim Jung-Un played by Randall Park. But Franco is not very consistent or good in this sort of satire. It was very overplayed and overdone, so much so that its very distracting. Someone like Will Ferrell I think could have pulled this off much better. Speaking of Randall Park, he does a good job, brings a lot of humor and insecurities to Kim Jung-Un. The film tires to be decent, but it ultimately fails to do so. For instance Rogen's character Aaron is dismissed by other colleagues because he only delivers celebrity based news and headlines instead of providing real news. That all happens within fifteen minutes, but then it drops all that by the time the second act comes through. It also tries to get into political comedy, but then that's also drops. They try these ideas and then it gets dropped very quickly and they resort to gags, which to me was a little disappointing, but nevertheless some of them were quite humorous. Also I though the film could have used a little more Lizzy Caplan.In short, it's forgettable, hard to sit through in some areas, despite maybe three or four decent laughs. 5.7/10",The Interview

I do not hate those 2 and gave this movie a fair chance. I do love typecasting because it insures that a character is played by an actor who can play that character. The main failure in this movie is that Franco and Rogen are totally unbelievable in their roles as a director and host, better type-casted a couple of actors who can do these roles. That leaves the question about who on earth wrote the story. I strongly believe some 6 year old kid wrote it because the humor is just so awful childish, that it's a pain to watch. The humor is best described as the product of a human body because it's very cheap. Perhaps you can enjoy this movie if you are a true Franco or Rogen fan, but otherwise, if there is a better movie around, watch that one.",The Interview
176,feyipuk,Media spin and American stupidity,8,26 July 2015,"An American interviewer, more used to following up on celebrity trash stories - which are the ones that tend to go viral over social media - and lives on controversy, gets the opportunity to speak to the leader of a secretive nation, with the back drop that the latter could be planning to destroy the formers country and needs to be stopped. Many of the jokes are graphic, and there's plenty of sex related comments and some nudity, but that just makes the button down attitude of the North Koreans even more apparent. The violence is more cartoonish in appearance, with plenty of blood, but seemingly little pain; when James Bond fights in Die Another Day (also in North Korea), there's lots of action, but little evidence of the effects. Here the effects are quite visible, to the degree of slapstick. The reason for rating it highly is more with how it deals with the American media and the way everything is sensationalised. At the start of the film, Eminem - whose uncredited in the film, though is listed on IMDb - is also interviewed by Franco, with his revelations (which are delivered quite matter of factly and aren't really that amazing) being blown up into a huge ""OMG, did he really say that! OMG! OMG!!!"".That outside the film, North Korea responded in the way they did simply added to the story of what average people are presented with, and how much they really understand. The producers could have created a fictional dictatorship, in a made up country, with a caricature leader. Instead they chose a fictional TV host and producer, on a fictional TV show (with references to real ones) and caricatures of the media and Government agencies, in relation to what are real life concerns. It's funny for the irony you could see them doing something like the script in real life and what the reaction would be.",The Interview
177,AbhiMathews,Nothing to see here,1,24 December 2014,"It's not always that a movie leaves me completely unmoved, but The Interview surely did. The entire sequence of forced events made watching it uncomfortable. The plot isn't inherently bad but the poor execution dulls the entire 112 minutes. From comedy that is cringeworthy to acting that is barely tolerable, it's tough to find motivation to endure through the movie. After a little while, your mind simply becomes numb to sensation. Seth Rogen and James Franco are not generally known for masterpieces, and this script is no exception. If you're looking for a laugh or just a good time, please look further.",The Interview
178,joshua-303-92778,A serious review,6,24 December 2014,"I don't usually enjoy films in the Seth Rogen genre, so I had low expectations for The Interview. The movie is better than I expected. It's not as vulgar and trashy as I was expecting.The plot is stupid, and makes no effort to conceal that fact. It's quite watchable, despite a slowdown midway through.Seth Rogen is basically hilarious every time he's on screen, as much as it pains me to admit that. James Franco -as others have do doubt pointed out- is insufferable. He's plain annoying and unlikeable.This otherwise quite ordinary film will be viewed through the curious lens of foreign relations. It serves as an unwitting example of Western culture. The good, and the bad.",The Interview

180,CelluloidDog,More an Insult to Good Filmmaking than to Kim Jong-un,3,10 February 2015,"Of course, like everyone, I wanted to watch this due to controversy. I didn't see the reviews unil after seeing it and was shocked how political IMDb has become. I am referring to the protest on censorship which gave this movie a 10/10 briefly. Apparently 53,000+ (32%) votes were in protest to make it a 10/10 without seeing it. If you discredit 50,000 and leave 3,000 as real ratings, the actual IMDb rating is about a 6 out of 10. Or average. But really people...So was it worthwhile to watch? NO.The film starts off terrific as Dave and Aaron are approached to do an interview with the Supreme Leader. The CIA gets involved and briefs the two on an assassination plot. Subtly, perhaps this plot is equally an insult to US foreign policy as to North Korean leadership. It it funny at that point and has plenty of silly gags. The timing of the songs (e.g, Katy Perry or the Winds of Change at the end) is witty. Costumes and sets were excellent. The welcoming of Dave and Aaron, the moments Dave spends getting to know Kim is actually enjoyable, the fight over the ricin, Sook's seduction of Aaron, and the adorable kids with the oversized guitars is almost out of place but actually funny. The fake grocery store is actually quite funny but...But then the movie takes the wrong turn down the cliff. Somehow it runs out of moves like a rat trapped in a maze. Perhaps that is due to poor script-writing or just a poor concept of what to do with the film. Where to go? So, like a 8 year old boy playing with a few toys, let's decapitate the heads for no reason. That is, the movie commit suicide. It becomes a senseless blood bath and finger chewing. Losing humor to tasteless shock value.It suffers from lack of intelligence and literacy. Probably the worst comedy I've seen since Tom Green's Freddy Got Fingered which nearly swept the Razzie Awards (those awards are given to the worst film of the year) which received 24% 1 out of 10 ratings. The problem is that it is not ranked among IMDb worst, since apparently a few thousand fans tried to inflate the rating giving 10s. That is a problem with IMDb as maybe 50% of raters lack objectivity, especially for films made after 1990.In short, it is fascinating to watch but painfully stumbles. Like a plane taking off and crashing. Or a drunk person getting up and then falling down flat. At the end, watching James Franco trying to pull off Jim Carrey expressions with a puppy seems to be an actor who lost his way. But this film cost $44 million. Of course, it should have a great set and more. But $44 million?! That could have feed starving North Korea for two days. Well, Sony lost nearly $40 million and lost its corporate sense after the hack.To balance things, I give a 3/10. The real rating? First half is a 6/10 and second half is a 2/10. The problem is the budget and how this movie leaves a terrible taste in your mouth.",The Interview

183,JamesIan2021,A Massive Disappointment,2,6 May 2015,"Controversial, yes. That's all I have to agree with on this movie. The Interview finds James Franco at his most unlikable, I didn't see it coming. Not a single moment does Franco deliver a laugh let alone smile worthy moment. Vulgar, whiny, grotesque, obnoxious and spoilt, these are just a few words to describe his character Dave Skylark, who is joined by Aaron Rapoport to assassinate Kim Jong Un under CIA instruction. Seth Rogen is comes across a bit more serious here, despite scenes where he is forced to shove certain packages up his backside. Still, yet again no laughs from Rogen. After the non-stop barrage of laughs in ""This Is The End"", this is a colossal step-down and failure in my eyes. Evan Goldberg directs with his usual party style antics and graceful slow motion scenes, which is about the only decent moment in this entire film where the President of North Korea watches as a tank shell hits his helicopter, and it explodes dramatically. Also the opening with the young girl singing about America was amusing. Two funny moments in an almost two hour comedy? Not worth your time.",The Interview
184,Mikelikesnotlikes,"Not funny, not clever, not able to live up to the hype.",2,30 December 2014,"Welcome to another typically American, childishly unsophisticated, cringe inducing script snatched from a lazy writer's slush pile.I admit I only watched this movie due to the publicity surrounding the Sony hacking scandal. Now having seen the movie, I totally fail to appreciate how North Korea could feel so threatened by it. The ridiculous portrayal of their leader did not cover any important or accurate information regarding how the people of NK live. Sony has mishandled a perfectly good propaganda vehicle that could have had far reaching effects.But back to the steaming turd I had to watch. There's very little in the way of intelligent humour to keep thinking adults entertained - tits, bums and fart jokes will amuse the kids, but then the over the top gore made it unsuitable for under 15's anyway. Way to go, marketing.There's absolutely no depth to this movie. The only slight interest I felt rise up was Kim Jung-un's comparison of his death camps to America's appalling incarceration levels. Correctly handled, showing the world how North Korea's failures are somewhat mirrored by our own societal lapses could definitely have been humorous and thought- provoking but the inane dialogue carefully dodges any attempt at wit.There's a real feeling of this movie filling the minutes with exact helpings of what a low socio-economic demographic expects to see. Haven't seen a breast for 10 minutes? - insert one here. No one's mentioned farting for 5 minutes? - release gas now. Out of context? Doesn't matter!What a recycled barf bag this movie was - glad I saw it for free.",The Interview
185,MovieSonic,Did you enjoy Your Highness?,7,1 February 2015,"The best way to decide if you'll enjoy The Interview is to consider if you found Your Highness (2011) funny and if you like the pairing of James Franco and Seth Rogan e.g. in Pineapple Express (2008).The Interview isn't as good as either of those two films (or as funny) but I'll say this: when The Interview is funny, it is wake-up-your-neighbours-with-your-cackling funny. The opening scene with Eminem was beyond hilarious which is probably because Eminem does straight-face humour really well.There's not really any intelligence here at all, the film is definitely aimed at young teenagers, but keep in mind that it's probably a good way to get them interested about things that are going on in the world.The only criticism I have for the Franco/Rogan duo is that they need to work on making their scripts consistently funny throughout. It's not enough to have a handful of hilarious scenes; there has to be more.I've given this 7/10 because once again, they've managed to pack in some random fantastic special effects and I did genuinely keep my neighbours up with my laughing, especially because I kept rewinding some parts but it's not consistent so you might want to have your phone handy for some Googling when things quieten down.7/10",The Interview
186,Thunderbuck,Not sure what people were expecting...,9,27 December 2014,"For what it is, ""The Interview"" is fine. It's an adolescent comedy with moronic slapstick humour, in very much the same vein as the previous Seth Rogen/James Franco movie ""This is the End"". It's vulgar, raunchy, and contains no pretence of social responsibility.Personally, I laughed my butt off. The jokes worked for me, and in fact I wound up seeing it twice this weekend and found many jokes I'd missed on the first viewing.You can really look at ""The Interview"" as kind of the 2014 version of the old Crosby-Hope ""Road"" movies. No substance, fun chemistry, doofy plot. Rogen is actually very funny as Franco's straight man.I like the generosity of these guys that they give lots of laughs to their supporting cast, too. Randall Park's role as Kim Jong Un didn't strike me as terribly convincing, but he winds up covering a pretty fair emotional range.Again, vulgar, raunchy, and no pretence of social responsibility. Or really any responsibility. If you're good with that, you have a better-than-average chance of liking this movie.",The Interview
187,charliep14,For a very particular audience,7,10 February 2018,"Seth Rogen humour is an acquired taste. When he's with his friends having what is obviously a blast, it's borderline 'clicque-y' and is definitely niche. The interview is definitely that: a few friends having fun, and they happened to chose a touchy subject
It's stupid, low brow, definitely not in very good taste... but for some people (yours truly included) it is fun. There is something special about getting the funds to make this movie. Some of the smaller roles are definitely not very well played, but Franco and Rogen hold the movie and the plethora of friends showing up in the beginning is amazing. 
If you disliked Seth Rogen, pass on this movie!",The Interview
188,fluturoj,Amusing,7,3 July 2016,"There were a lot of elements that were unnecessary and discussing for my taste. For example, why was there a need for all those finger biting scenes? But I guess since this was a James Franco and Seth Rogen movie one would expect scenes like that based on their previous movies when they have appeared together. Surprisingly, I found James Franco's performance very good and his character quite funny. Usually I am not a fan of James Franco but in this movie I think he does quite a good job. The puppy in the end was just adorable. I found it amusing that Dave Skylark was more concerned with the puppy's life than with that of his best friend. Overall I think that one might enjoy watching this movie but as I said before there were a lot of scenes that were just discussing and unnecessary.",The Interview

People thought the film was hilarious and worthwhile.Now we get ""The Interview"" and North Korea threatens to murder Americans who go to see it.Well, I've seen it, and I understand why Kim Jong Un would be upset. The movie is 1) Political commentary disguised as entertainment and 2) A lengthy personal insult of a nation's leader.I agree that Kim Jong Un is a despot, a crackpot and dangerous, but for goodness sake, presenting this scathing and scatological portrayal as entertainment says terrible things about everyone connected with the production and distribution of this movie. Viewers are not at fault because until we see it, we don't know what we'll be seeing. But while Sony didn't deserve the abuse it received (bad taste is not a crime...although bad judgment can be) and no one should be made afraid of going to a movie theater no matter how objectionable the story and characterizations may be, if Sony loses money on this film, they deserve that.All of that said, I will to say I thought the movie was occasionally funny, certainly more so than many reviewers on this site acknowledge.

190,rachelgallit,Topical to the Point of Painful,8,16 February 2019,"A film written, directed, and produced by the actors that star within it cannot be expected to soar to great heights. This film wanders around political and cultural commentary and holds fervently to slapstick and blatantly offensive humor. That is not to say this is an unappealing style, simply one achieved with little grace or art, but rather a heavy hand and an affinity for swear words. James Franco controlled most aspects of this movie, and given his MO, the film is not a failure, but rather a misstep. Talkshow host Dave Skylark and his friend/producer Aaron infiltrate North Korea at Kim Jong-Un's request (as a fan of the show) and attempt to carry out a CIA orchestrated assassination given their favorable position. Dave and Kim find common ground, and lines are blurred and loyalties muddled. The volatile nature of the plot does rather compliment the style of dialogue and aggressively-uncouth manner of the humor, but the whole thing is heavy handed and quickly becomes abrasive.",The Interview

I was so excited to see this movie that I just had to rent it from Youtube once it was available in Canada. James Franco and Seth Rogen play a TV host and producer who basically do stupid celebrity stories and do nothing of importance. There is a very funny interview with Eminem that is too funny to spoil on this. When they find out that Kim Jong Un is a fan of there show, they both decide that they would like to interview him. Excited about the prospect they have a wild party and a horrible hangover when the CIA shows up the next day asking them to kill Kim Jon Un. There is a very funny joke with honey potting someone as the CIA agent assigned to them dresses up in a way that James Franco would like. It's funny seeing them train for what they would have to do to kill Kim Jong Un and has some hilarious one liners. Once there is North Korea everything that can go wrong does go wrong and hilarity ensues. The actor who plays Kim Jong Un is hilarious and I love the fact that he's a big fan of American TV and music. GO see this movie. It's hilarious",The Interview
192,GoUSN,Proof that the First Amendment protects ugly too . . .,1,5 January 2015,"About six minutes into the watching of my new patriotic duty, The Interview, I asked myself, well, I asked and then told myself, ""Please dear Lord, tell me the whole movie is not like this because after all, it's my patriotic duty to watch it and I want to feel a little like during WWII and booing Mussolini on the newsreels."" Only it wasn't like booing Mussolini on the newsreels. In fact, watching a few long-winded Mussolini speeches (preferably on train timetables) might have been preferable to watching this.So I gave it a little more time.No, this has to be me. I am missing a major point here, since after all I am celebrating the First Amendment by watching (and paying!) for this, so I have to feel good about it! I want my heart to beat! (My red white and blue heart!) I want to LIKE the two stars of The Interview. I want to see them being competent and skilled, dressed as they are in their new Bill of Rights wear.But no. Changes of scene did not improve this movie. Plodding, forced, poor writing, unwatchable.I'd like to say, save your money and buy a ticket to see Warner Bros.' Ducktators instead. But then I remembered that Ducktators is available FOR FREE. So you can save your money PLUS watch Ducktators, a classic lampoon of dictators, despots, and our favorite Axis villains. It's a WWII Looney Toons short that packs a far more skilled punch than The Interview. As to The Interview, I'm going to drop a note to James Franco, going something like this. ""Hey James. Next time don't film your rough draft. Signed, Me. P.S. - Enclosed is a copy of Ducktators."" (Available on Youtube! Free!)",The Interview
193,SteveMierzejewski,Dumb and Dumber do The Interview,3,25 December 2014,"For the sake of film criticism, I will pretend that I watched the film without the political maelstrom that has raised it to a level of interest that it would otherwise never have attained.This is the typical mass produced, lowbrow, comedy that Hollywood cranks out to appeal to 15-year-old boys. There are a few slapstick laughs in the tradition of the Three Stooges that break the monotony. I would not elevate the film to the level of a satire as that would imply that there was some intelligent thought behind it. There is not. All the humor, both physical and verbal, is completely obvious. It will not go down in history as one of the great comedies, which is probably what upset Kim Jung Un the most.The attempts to make political observations are all based on time-worn points (people are starving, Kim is not a god). The sections that imply Kim has psychological problems may be more irritating to the regime. Most of the attempted humor deals with Kim fighting his homophobia and dealing with a father who gave him little support.There is no need to comment on the acting as there really is none. No one will win an Oscar nomination here. The story is predictable: You can guess what will happen before you begin watching it. It's the kind of film you watch to see a few gags and, maybe, get a few laughs. They will be very few, indeed, unless you are 15 or under. However, knowing the media attention that this film has received, it is unlikely a poor review will stop anyone from watching it. Just remember, I warned you.",The Interview

195,sackofwhine,The Interview- A true comedy,8,8 July 2015,"If you have read the news last year, you probably heard about the infamous ""Sony hacking"" scandal. It was pretty much inevitable, especially in the US. The story was everywhere and the cause of this fiasco was this movie. A comedy movie directed by Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogan who previously directed ""This is the End"" a movie which is now one of my personal favorite comedies. That being said, I was quite disappointed to not experience this movie in a cinema with a full crowd because, as many of you know, it was pulled out of every cinema in the world and only released later in a few selected theaters and on demand, when everybody pretty much streamed it illegally. But, I now had the pleasure to finally watch this infamous movie at home and even though I didn't watch it with a crowd, I was still thoroughly entertained by this piece of comedy extravaganza. Goldberg and Rogan knock it out of the park once again. I hope this streak lasts because they make the kinds of comedies that are daring and original as well as gut busting hilarious. Every scene has something funny going on, not one minute was I thinking ""When do the jokes come again?"" because the film- makers try their best to keep their audience rolling on the floor from laughter. Rogan and Franco show once again what real comedic chemistry means. Every scene they're in is hilarious. This has no doubt something to do with the fact that it's their 6th collaboration, so every scene they're in feels real because it comes across like two dudes that know each other and that are really good friends. Franco especially steals the show. He does play almost the same character as in ""Pineapple Express"", the naive and dumb good looking guy, but it fits the circumstances. Besides, there are various ways to play a character with the same characteristics, and Franco undoubtedly knows what he's doing, since every scene he's in made me laugh. On a side note, for 44 million dollars, there are a lot of well filmed scenes that could easily come from a higher budgeted movie. If I look at movies like ""Jack and Jill"", with a budget of 80 million dollars, which doesn't have any of the spectacle going on as ""The Interview"" does,I truly wonder what kind of scheme Hollywood is playing, because it does seem fishy to me. Anyways, don't get distracted by all the hype surrounding this movie, just see it as a normal piece of entertainment and you might really end up liking it. If you aren't a fan of crass humor, stay away from it, because it is offensive, vulgar and violent. But sometimes, that's exactly what you need.",The Interview

They end up landing a interview with Kim Jong-UN (Randall Park) but the CIA tells them they have to assassinate him. The two leads have good chemistry constantly arguing and shooting one liners which leads to funny results.Seth Rogan & Evan Goldberg did a good job with directing delivering suspenseful moments, decent acting and good looking shots.The screenplay written by Dan Sterling is decent while it does deliver laughs the humor can sometimes be to absurd or disjointedThe story as many have said does slow down somewhat in the second act it but pick the pace in the third act.Don't expect this movie to be the greatest political satire ever it is just a silly Rogan comedy with a political back drop. The film is receiving mostly negative reviews because of the hype of the controversy this film had.Overall the The Interview is a funny comedy movie with good chemistry from the main leads and funny moments but is disjointed at times and is just another Rogan comedy movie.

197,j-madej,North Korea was trying to do us a favor ;-),5,28 December 2014,"Any publicity is a good publicity and this saying is never more valid as in case of the comedy that intensified the cyberwar between North Korea and USA and SONY which has been the target of the initial hacker attack . ""The Interview"" has been elevated to the rank of the national security threat not being able to be played in the cinemas only online. However it's been released in select cinemas from Christmas and it can be also viewed on youtube for a fee. It almost looks like SONY wanted to try to market different way of delivering film product to it's viewer and was able to afford it with the production costs on ""The Interview"" were estimated as about $44 Million and created this as publicity scheme. Deduct the salaries of the stars Rogen $8.4 Mil and Franco 6.5 Mil then the actual budget does not seems so big.In movies everything comes down to the writhing. If the script is funny and witty you might have a chance that with the right people behind it, it will not get screwed up. With comedy it also all comes down to the taste of the person who wrote the script, as well as the director and of course the main stars. Judging from their previous movies most people know what to expect from duo Seth Rogen and James Franco by now. They might not have the most sophisticated comedic tastes. Let's just say their comedic IQ is quite primitive, more of a stoner, fart in your face with homo erotic undertone to it. Now if that is your cup of tea, so to speak, then you might have fun through this very mediocre film that without all the publicity, would just crumble to the rightful place in the oblivion of all other funnier and more tasteful comedic choices this Christmas. I am not saying that you will not laugh during watching it, all I am saying is that for all the hype around it, this is not work of the comedic genius, that needs to be clear. Here is the synopsis:""Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen) are the team behind the popular tabloid-TV show ""Skylark Tonight."" After learning that North Korea's Kim Jong Un (Randall Park) is a huge fan of the show, they successfully set up an interview with him, hoping to legitimize themselves as actual journalists. However, as Dave and Aaron prepare for their journey to Pyongyang, the CIA steps in, recruits them, and assigns them an incredible mission: Assassinate the dictator.""I really wanted to like ""The Interview"" and lets be clear it is not that I didn't like it so much, it is just that the expectations from all the publicity that makes you want to watch it just to have your own personal victory over cyber terror organizations, etc. The fact is that the are some funny out loud moments and on-screen Rogen and Franco have a lot of chemistry together. They have a very good timing in their scenes, though the taste of the gags have something to be desired. It is obvious that there could have been so much more depth here specially considering the topic but as I mentioned before those two have already specific comedic thing going on and if you are above 15 years old and indulge in ""Pineapple Express"", if you know what I mean, you might not think that this film was worth all the hustle. If you are expecting to see type of comedic historical event like Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"" (1940) where he played Hitler which created large publicity at the time of WWII which actually deliver on its promise, ""The Interview"" on the other hand did not... Enjoy it for what it is and after you've seen it maybe you will come to the same conclusion that North Korea was trying to do us a favor and save us from this not always successful execution of what was suppose to be an enjoyable comedic ride.",The Interview
198,TheMovieSnob247,Let's be honest here: This was much ado about nothing.,5,10 January 2015,"It's exactly what it appears to be: a low brow, frat house comedy ala Pineapple Express or This Is The End. Nothing more, nothing less. If you enjoyed those movies, you'll enjoy this as well (admittedly, those were better comedies). I won't lie though, I laughed and I laughed a lot (especially in the first half as it has some great moments). Rogen and Franco are in fine form and their goofy brand of humour is definitely in my wheelhouse. It's very silly and at times ridiculously funny, but the second half does labour on and near the end the jokes do get a bit stale (after a while you're just kind of waiting for the movie to end). That's never a great sign for a movie, let alone a comedy; so this is very much a mixed bag.If a few cheap laughs are what you're in the mood for, this will do the trick (I would also recommend 22 Jump Street from earlier this year as it's in a similar vein and a lot funnier). But if you were looking to watch this to make some grand statement of supporting free speech or just to see what all the political hoopla was about, I say pass. There's really not much here and it's really undeserving of the media frenzy that surrounded it. For the most part, this was a forgettable film.Was my review not horrible? Great!

And James Franco as Dave Skylark - he seem to be a moronic fool, trying to impress audience. The whole setting just doesn't blend at all. No proper film setting.

It was out of place.If anything, all the talk about the ""bad publicity"" of North Korea, I will say it makes a very bad effort to do so if that had been the intention. It portrait the Americans much worse that the Koreans with focus on asses, drugs and sex - and particular the 2 interviewers (dumb and dumber)So.... enjoy it for the humor, and if you are put off by gore - just skip the last part, until the last 2 minutes or so.Summary: Fun and hilarious - unnecessary gore ending that could have been created to be more funny as well. For sure nothing shocking new that will put North Korea in a bad light.",The Interview
204,robbotnik2000,Sets a low bar and just gets over it.,4,5 January 2015,"Just saw ""The Interview"" and can say a couple of things about it. It had a significant budget as the scenes and mechanics are colorful and well-staged. It has acceptable actors. James Franco plays an entertainment interviewer as a cheesy cable television glad-hander with a toothy smile that transmits empty-headed good humor, Rogen plays his twin emotions of exasperation and intermittent conscience as he's done in all his movies. There are some decent performances by the female lead and the actor who plays the North Korean kid-ruler. He is too good looking for the part, but he looks as if he's convinced himself into the part, which is one of the early stages of acting. This film is somewhat reminiscent of ""Stripes"" a Bill Murray vehicle of the 70s, which unlike ""The Interview"" had a sense of humor and some sort of conflicts. requiring resolution. I thought ""The Interview"" had one good line in it and it sounded like a retreaded line from the Sunday talk shows.",The Interview
205,ramair350,"A good old fashion ""eff yew"" to North Korea",10,24 December 2014,"This movie is exactly what I expected when I first saw the trailer a couple of months ago. In short, it is a couple of hours packed with completely outrageous and inappropriate humor, Rogen and Franco style.And yes, the very best part about it is that it is completely American. I will be buying the DVD (heck, I'll even spring for the BluRay) to go alongside my Team America: World Police DVD.I watched the Youtube version, and the technical quality was excellent. Thank you to Sony for making the release of this movie possible. And North Korea, I am sure Sony thanks you for giving this movie 100 times more publicity than if you had done nothing to prevent the release of the film.U-S-A! U-S-A!",The Interview
206,ComradWinston,A simple and consciously dumb comedy that gets a point across while remaining entertaining.,10,16 February 2015,"This is as you should expect, a stupid movie about two morons or at the very least one moron who ends up trying to kill the rider of unicorns and man without a butthole himself. Knowing this, its actually quite good for what it is. Its not incredibly hilarious but amusing at the least and *the* running joke gets a bit dragged out but I can't resist appreciating that dumb joke in a movie I fully expected to be dumb.When it comes to our two assassin protagonists, it simply works well and there's clearly some chemistry between them. The idiot has a pretty well defined range of stupid while also being fully capable of ingenious deception and his sane protagonist buddy balances it out pretty well. Mostly though the best bits are in North Korea, especially between Skylark and Kim.As for those bemoaning the very existence of this movie, they couldn't be more determined to find something offensive sheerly to complain about this movie. The whole movie's premise is the mocking of pseudo-theocratic tyranny, promotes individual revolutionary acts of heroism, the stupidest running joke subtly points out how sexism is a two way street, a female character heads the assassination operation, and another female character ends up leading a glorious revolution. If this isn't the mark of a proper decent comedy and secondly one full of relevant humanist ideas, I wouldn't know how to begin insulting your apparently obtuse and backwards ideals.This movie's alright and at the very least, worth watching once.",The Interview
207,derek-a-charette100,This movie gives a new meaning to the word ignorance. God help us all.,1,14 March 2015,"I must say... I have been avoiding HollyWEIRD movies for the past few years because they have been getting worse by the day. Although I hate Seth Rogen, I gave this movie a 40 minute chance, because I hate Kim Jong Un even more than Rogen. I am shocked. The unfathomable new low of beyond terrible acting and pure ignorance is beyond sickening. And trust me, 'ignorant' is even giving them far too much credit. I am not aware of an English word yet that would correctly describe the lack of intelligence that this excuse of a movie displays. I am not a professional film critic, but I have watched thousands of movies. I love movies and I do know a bad movie when I see it. I was multitudes more thrilled and entertained to see that so many other people have the same feelings about this movie as me! The fact that so many people have said they like this movie is a scary thought and makes me worry about the future well being of America. This debauchery of a movie is a reflection of the ever lowering levels of intelligence in our country.",The Interview
208,Jerominator,Stealth propaganda,1,27 December 2014,"There's basically two ways to go when watching this film. You can abandon the real world and just watch it as a no brainer comedy, or not. I tried to do that, I really did, but they made it impossible in the end. The script wasn't great but admittedly there were a few funny absurd or vulgar gags that normally would've made this a half decent comedy. But what I ultimately found offensive about this was the ham fisted stealth propaganda I was having violently force fed down my throat throughout the film. What makes me laugh is the premise that the good ole USA, land of the free is taking out the evil leader of an evil totalitarian regime that brainwashes its people, yet this is exactly the kind of ridiculous propaganda you might expect from such a regime. And hell, maybe North Korea *is* all the bad things they make out; I can't say because I've never been there, and I rely on an objective media to give me an accurate picture of what that place and its government is like. Yet increasingly I'm getting the feeling I'm being fed a narrative via the western media that is hell-bent on delivering a clearly skewed and biased depiction of this place. Given the accuracy of the previous narratives we have had rammed down our throats about those other countries on the ""axis of evil"", forgive me for daring to step back and question if what I'm being fed is entirely accurate. And lets not forget the extremely delicate history of the region, similarly used like Vietnam as a proxy battleground between the US and the USSR/China in the cold war, as a result of which the place and people have been left horrifically traumatised and mutilated. Is it any wonder there is anti-western sentiment north of the border? But no, apparently we in the West are only capable of interpreting the situation as evil evil ridiculous evil people who are of course closet homosexuals and Katy Perry fans, being all evil and mean just for the hell of it, yknow, because they're all evil. If the history and current situation were not so flawed and grey and delicate, this might be a permissible throwaway giggle-fest, but given the real world we live in, it's a very ham-fisted stealth manifesto for a version of the world I am finding very difficult to believe in any more. And I don't appreciate the ploy of being slipped something disguised as just a silly comedy film that attempts to slyly ram such a message down my throat via the backdoor. I think the conception of this movie was incredibly ill-advised. It wants to be everything that Team America was, but lacks the intelligent writing that poked fun at all sides. I know this review won't win me any friends but I seriously don't give a toss - I found this so beyond laughably bad I had to write something.",The Interview
209,lucas739,Pretty dire,3,25 December 2014,"I can't understand why Kim Jong Un is getting so stressed over this piece of drivel. Of all the characters he was the most entertaining. Rogen and Franco really need to be sent to separate corners to save their careers. The pathetic stream of anus,sex & sh!t jokes is typical Rogen fare, tedious and unimaginative. As a lightweight piece of pre teen nonsense i suppose you could say it succeeded but on any other level, if you stretch your head above your crotch, it fails. Watch it to satisfy your curiosity then forget about it and move on. Another problem with this film is that there really isn't anything interesting enough to write about that will take up the ten lines necessary before this review can be submitted. Obviously there hasn't been allowances made for films like The Interview, which really doesn't justify the extra effort.",The Interview
210,razvan-rogoz,Good comedy,10,25 December 2014,"OK, this is an actual review of the movie. There were tons of reviews before this movie was released. However, since it was released on VOD and on YouTube, now it is available.Is this a 10/10 movie? No. It is not. Sometimes the action is too slow paced and the pacing is a bit wrong. Towards the end, things are getting really, really interesting and even if there is a great climax, closure, 10 more minutes of the movie could be added.As a comedy, it works great. There are some really funny scenes but it contains not your usual type of humor. Instead, it is more subtle and you actually need brains to understand it (some scenes, not all of this).As a anti NK movie, I don't know. I've seen Team America too. I think that there was too much fuss about this movie. Without the hacking and threats, it would have simply been another comedy. I will gladly pay the ticket when it will release to theaters to see it again with someone but it is no Interstellar or Godfather.There is a lot of gore in this movie, nicely done. There is some nudity, very limited. There is some tension but since we all knew by now how the movie is going to end, it was a bit anti-climatic. It is a nice movie to watch. Don't expect to say WOW but expect to like it. It is not bad, it is actually very decent but don't come with ""Citizen Kane"" like expectations.",The Interview

212,InMyHonestOpinion,Same old thing for these two; not so funny anymore men.,3,26 December 2014,"Unless you have been living under a rock for the past month or so you would have heard of the The Interview starring Seth Rogan and James Franco. I'm not going to go into all the politics that surrounded the film but I will say that I'm glad Sony changed their mind and released the film even if it is limited release. The story is interesting to say the least. James Franco (Spiderman, 127 Hours) plays Dave Skylark a television interviewer who brings all the celebrity news to life with no holds barred interview questions unfortunately though he is seen as a bit of joke with his interview technique and style of questioning. Seth Rogan (Neighbours, This is the End) plays Aaron Rapaport the producer and director of Skylarks show. After getting a huge break where Eminem divulges some very interesting news (welcome to the family) Dave and Aaron soon realize what they do is at the butt end of the news industry. Dave receives some news that Kim Jong-UN played by Randall Park (Sex Tape, Neighbours) the North Korean President loves his show and gets Aaron to arrange an interview. A date for three weeks is set and the Interview of a lifetime will take place cementing both Dave and Aaron's future as real journalists amongst their peers. What they don't expect though is the CIA to come knocking on their door to ask a very big favor whilst over in North Korea The Interview has so much hype built around it, if you go into a viewing with a clear mind and not expecting the best thing since Ben Hur you may actually enjoy what happens. It's not the greatest film and there were a few funny moments as well as some very disturbing moments. I think this will be a film to go down in history not for its content but for other much more obvious reasons. Both characters are as annoying and dysfunctional as each other, once again the duo have released another mediocre film in their usual styling. D#ck jokes, ass jokes, p#ss and sh#t jokes, the usual things for these guys when they get together. There is nothing new here at all just the same thing told from a new location. Watch it at your own peril.",The Interview
213,Ryan_9,Good comedy that people shouldn't take too seriously,8,2 June 2020,"""The Interview"" was a fun movie. It starred James Franco and Seth Rogen, who played Dave Skylark and Aaron Rappaport, two guys that have their own talk show and decide to ask Kim Jong Un (Randall Park), who happens to be a big fan of the show for an interview. He accepts the offer and the CIA learn about this which leads to them tracking down Dave and Aaron and giving them the crazy task of killing Kim Jong Un.I liked the plot as it was really fun and entertaining. You'd think a movie about killing Kim Jong Un would be all serious but it wasn't. James Franco (Dave) and Seth Rogen (Aaron) were funny in this. Randall Park (Kim) was also funny as he actually made Kim Jong Un seem like a nice guy but obviously as the movie progresses we learn that he is not. I actually thought Dave died when Kim shot him and I loved how he jumped up revealing that he had a bulletproof vest. Nice callback to earlier on when he kept telling Agent Lacey how much he wanted one.Overall, I'll give ""The Interview"" an 8/10. Good movie with a lot of funny moments!",The Interview
214,mjdk2,Horrible,2,26 December 2014,"We all watched this movie because we don't want some two-bit dictator telling us what we can and cannot do.Unfortunately for us viewers, if Kim Jung Un had just left it alone, this movie would have barely lasted a day - it would have imploded instead of becoming a must see cult movie.It is the typical pubescent wanna-be comedy that we have become accustomed from by Seth Rogen. The same crap such as Neighbors, Knocked Up and Zack and Miri make a Porno - same stupid mindless movie that he always churns out. But while the other were bearable this one is just plain dumb. I really doubt that all the people that voted this movie up actually saw it. But I guess patriotism won and were are giving a really bad movie a pass this time.",The Interview
215,febru3012,I was surprised by the quality of the sets and locations VERY WELL DONE!,9,26 December 2014,"While this comedy doesn't hit on all cylinders all the time, THE INTERVIEW does hit a majority of the time and makes the film well worth the price of admission. Like I said in the Summary the quality of the set designs, production and backgrounds i.e. New York, North Korea mountains, Kim's palace etc are all first rate and deserve a nomination for an Oscar. The acting is so so with Rogen and Franco doing an okay job. Some will be turned off no doubt by the use of F words and some flashes of bare breasts but these are not enough to bring down the overall experience of seeing this movie. The publicity surrounding this movie did influence my rating by about 2 points so without this hoopla I would have rated the movie a 7 or 8. Still, see the movie it feels like by attending your voting on a referendum for free speech.",The Interview
216,dreamdemon-1,A good bit of fun but no match to The Dictator,5,28 December 2014,"I am giving only 5 stars to this movie because while it's a fun ride and has all the tropes you'd expect in a Seth Rogen comedy (not necessarily my kind of comedy), as far as political satire is concerned the movie feels empty.When I watched this, I made a double feature by including Cohen's The Dictator for a quick comparison and in the end I found there's little to compare.The Dictator uses similar tropes but while it starts from ""tabloidified"" information on Middle East dictatorships and their perks (the luxury, a take on Khaddafi's all-female guard, nuclear ambitions without expertise, sleeping with stars, etc) it clashes that view with democracy quirks that mimic dictatorships (control of press by political powers, the creation of a climate of fear, fake reasons for going to war, terrorizing own population, rigged elections, etc). It's a fun ride that humorously underlines the forest that we often can't see because of the trees. It's a comedy that supports a hard truth and in the end it (might) leave the viewer thinking. Whether you agree or disagree with the message, the fact is that Sascha Baron Cohen does have a message for your consideration.The Interview, by contrast, it's just a fun ride. Had it not been surrounded by the cheap drama around it's launch day, I might have given it more. However, The Interview is still a fun comedy but when it comes to the political side, it tells shockingly little.The North Korean dictator is a kid enjoying some perks (nothing too crazy), they try to present a facade to western visitors (fake grocery shop), there is plenty of dissent and they have nukes. OK, but at the end I'm left with no other message, nothing to consider. It's a lot of fun but as it sets out to be a political parody, I'm surprised at the total lack of a political message except that ""Kim Jong-Un is a kid controlling a country"". Also, the gags revolve between those milder stuff (of which some are actually plucked from what refugees told the world - so not really exaggerations but simple truth) to sticking stuff up one's arse and exploding heads.All in good fun and I have to say I enjoyed it but I also felt that the hype was grossly exaggerated and in the end there was no actual political point.",The Interview
217,serafinogm,A ridiculously funny propaganda movie!,10,20 January 2018,"Is this movie a propaganda piece, an NWO comedy special? YES! Is this movie a ridiculously funny propaganda piece? A resounding YES! Can James 
Franco be any more absurdly funny then he was in 'The Interview', probably but it's hard to imagine. The guy playing Kim Jong-il was cast perfectly and his interactions with Franco were impossibly funny, simply irrepressibly funny material and performances. Rogan played a rather straight role he was more or less Dean Martin to Franco's Jerry Lewis and it was pitch perfect! I loved the movie and to think I almost didn't watch it because of all the bad press, well had I not watched it it would have been my loss! If you don't watch it, unless you're a tight ass, it will be your loss!",The Interview
218,jmoney-2,"Ironically, a movie about the evils of censorship",7,30 December 2014,"The Interview -- as anyone who's paid attention to the news lately knows -- is a movie satire that was briefly banned due to threats from hackers, purportedly backed by North Korea. So, it is no small irony that the over-the-top comedy's actual theme is freedom of speech – specifically, freedom of the press.Seth Rogen co-writes, co-directs and co-stars as Aaron Rapoport, a news producer who once aspired to be an investigative journalist. Instead, he has spent his career working for Dave Skylark (James Franco), the vacuous host of a tabloid interview show. When Skylark discovers that his fan base includes none other than the dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, he and his producer pursue and – to their astonishment – succeed in securing an interview with the despot. Skylark sees a chance for ratings and Rapoport sees a chance to gain legitimacy. But it's the CIA who sees an opportunity to have the hostile leader taken out. Lizzy Caplan plays the intelligence operative who convinces the Americans to discreetly deliver a dose of poison to Kim.Predictably, Aaron and Dave turn out to be bumbling assassins and the plot to kill Kim goes awry. Seeing the well-established comedy team of Rogen & Franco stumble through what would otherwise be a straightforward espionage thriller evokes memories of Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase in the '80s comedy Spies Like Us. This film, however, derives laughs less from spoofing spy movies and more from gross-out gags. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I laughed plenty of times during The Interview. Like most people, though, I had to watch the movie at home through a streaming service and I couldn't help but think it would've been a more enjoyable experience in a theater surrounded by fellow moviegoers. Laughter, as they say, is contagious. That said, if you enjoyed the crude humor employed by Rogen and co-director Evan Goldberg in their previous films (Superbad, This Is the End), then you'll enjoy the jokes in this movie.Many of those jokes involve the filmmaker's cartoon caricature of the dictator. Randall Park plays Kim as a spoiled rich kid who happens to possess nuclear weapons. Though his dark side is shown, the movie spends less time on his evil deeds and more time portraying him as a Katy Perry-loving buffoon with serious daddy issues. If the movie does in fact does bother the real Kim Jong-un, one can see why. As Moliere said, ""One might be willing to be wicked; one cannot bear to appear foolish."" The movie turns slightly more serious late in the game as Skylark discovers his inner Mike Wallace. We're given a parable of the power of journalism and a reminder of the importance of being able to confront leaders with tough questions. The movie is called The Interview for a reason. It turns out the most devastating weapon the movie's heroes wield is not poison, but rather, the truth.In the end, though, The Interview is a comedy. The concept of two idiots being entrusted with the task of eliminating one of the United States' greatest geo-political threats is inherently absurd. But since the movie itself has wound up at the center of an international incident, the idea seems a little less like a joke. And that may be the funniest thing of all.",The Interview
219,koen_smit,The Interview: A Lesson in Honeypotting.,8,27 December 2014,"One guy and his best friend set out to bring down the evil in his own country. No, this is not Lord of the Rings, this is The Interview. The intentionally use of the similarities to that epic story are widely spread throughout the movie. But that's the template within which a political satire unfolds. A honeypot is a seduction technique used in undercover operations to get what/where/who you want. Without spoiling anything, I can say everyone in this movie has their own way of honeypotting the other. The whole movie is packed with honeypots and it's great to discover one after the other. Some are very obvious, some you discover afterward. I think I will watch this movie again to find all of the different honeypots that are there. Because the story runs at a fast pace, with no unnecessary dips or plot holes, it's a joy to watch. I had myself cheering and laughing out loud more and more towards the end, the build-up towards the brutal, explosive and funny finale works big time. Thanks to a tight script filled with jokes (but never too much) and a strong directing. I enjoy the humor and chemistry of Seth Rogen and James Franco very much. And Randall Park portraits a very charming, and yet very evil Kim, what makes him no less than Rogen and Franco in this movie – well cast, my friends!Apart from all the controversy surrounding this movie (the not deliberate hack did conveniently create the must-see movie of the season for Sony), I just watched a very funny, very witty and sometimes quite brutal comedy about two friends getting honeypotted all the time by everyone.",The Interview
220,matjusm,Not quite up to the hype,6,25 December 2014,"Saw this film recently and I must say that it doesn't quite live up to the hype that has been generated by all the talk of hacking into Sony. The film is essentially a buddy comedy where a talk show host played by James Franco and his producer played by Seth Rogen head to North Korea to interview Kim Il Un. Before they go the CIA however gives them the task of assassinating the leader. The movie plays on the opposites that are the characters with Franco's being a somewhat dumb, naive and hotheaded character with Rogen's being more level headed. A lot of the comedy is derived on the interaction and dialog of Rogen and Franco but it is here that I find it doesn't always work. Franco's character is just far too over the top, a bit obnoxious even, and just gets on your nerves quite quickly. The plot line gets pretty absurd quickly but that is of course to be expected. The film has it's moments and it is funny at times but I find it ends up being just mediocre and you keep wishing that Franco's character wouldn't speak as much. Passable entertainment but nothing spectacular. 6/10",The Interview

The film contains the usual for an R rated, as their are a ton of sex jokes, but it's crazy plot, and its ridiculous ending involving crying, a bulletproof vest, and seal team six, show this film is anything but to be taken a sliver seriously.

Worst of all, the actor who played Kim was the worst. And the words spoken and words on subtitles were completely off. I had difficulty concentrating on the movie because of this. Hollywood needs to realize there are millions of viewer worldwide and should put a little effort casting actors who can speak the correct language. Is that too much to ask? Story wise, it was a bit funny in the begging but got stupid and corny really fast. I predicted from the beginning that the whole Sony hacking incident was all just publicity stunt made up by Sony themselves. Look at what happened. They released the movie and the hackers didn't do anything they said they'd do.",The Interview
223,jan_kalina,"""You protect that puppy with your life.""",10,22 January 2015,"Satire is not very popular genre among the general public since they don't usually see the irony. It is a rather sophisticated humor. That is why people should appreciate the cleverness of Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg latest comedy. It mixes the usual American slapstick humor with thought provoking ideas, comments. This way it can reach broader spectrum of people not unlike if it would be full-blown satire, the humor would be much more subtle, therefore lost on many people.Seth Rogen is in my opinion quite underrated. Sure his films feature a lot gross out humor but his films do send some message - usually about friendship. James Franco is in my opinion very underrated as well. He can be amazing in the dramatic roles and laugh out loud funny in comedies. He always fulfills the task.The Interview is not a just a film taking shots at North Korea. It is at multiple points harassing America as well. Mainly about their constant interference with other countries affairs. But as well the celebrity obsessed pop culture. Some call Franco's Dave Skylark too over the top and sleazy, but I guess you don't watch much TV. He just acts the same way as many talk show hosts do.Kim Jong-un is not portrayed simply as an villain that would way too easy. He is a very fleshed-out character. It doesn't portray him in any bad light. He might just be a young man thrown into an unexpected situation.Aftwr this breakdown you might think that I have forgotten about the comedy. Don't worry, everything is dealt with in a much exaggerated comedic fashion. The film is a non-stop ride where you won't catch all the jokes because of all the laughter. Seth Rogen and James Franco are today's modern comedy duo, now that Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson don't make many comedies anymore, and they are doing an amazing job.P.S. It is wonderful how simply adding an a puppy into the third act shenanigans, which is also throwback to the typical brutality in Asian films, can be so funny. I did think of this idea of adding a puppy into an action film before and I am glad someone has done it.",The Interview
224,dunnypop,Pineapple Express in North Korea,10,27 December 2014,"If you've seen Pineapple Express and This is the End and any other Seth Rogan and James Franco film this is pretty much the same. It's slightly witty, it's offensive, it's funny and I guess now it's controversial. The film is basically (and I will assume inspired by) the VICE documentary / Vice News / Dennis Rodman going to North Korea, where we explore this very strange land. The film plays out exactly like Pineapple Express... strange intro, and then right into the lives of Seth Rogan and James Franco's characters... and then a situation... all mixed in with drug and dick/fart humor. Seth Rogan doesn't smoke pot (like Dale in Pineapple Express) in the film, and James Franco is also as dumb as his drug dealer role in Pineapple Express but it's almost the same. Replace Danny McBrides character with Kim Jong Il and you have almost the exact same movie.This isn't a film to take seriously, because it's almost identical to Pineapple Express. I watched it (and was going to watch it if the whole hacker thing didn't happen) and found the movie hilarious. There are some references that you'll probably quote like 'Honey dipping'.This movie is worth watching if you loved Pineapple Express and the other films that Seth Rogan films. It probably works better on the large screen (I rented it) as there are a lot of cheap laughs. Btw the soundtrack is pretty awesome.",The Interview

If you like comedy and loathe policital correctness, then ""The Interview"" is a treat for you. Coming from writers Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg and Dan Sterling you can expect the usual sexualised jokes and many hilarious moments, where other actors might be too embarrassed to take part. Again Seth Rogan and James Franco proove to be a comedic dream team and surprise us with new facial expressions and terrible outfit choices.I found myself remembering the good old classics ""The Naked Gun"" and ""Hot Shots"", since the jokes made me really laugh despite them being kinda dumb. However the cast does a wonderful job keeping me entertained throughout. Especially Randall Park deserves a shout-out who plays the Korean ""Supreme Leader"" in splendid fashion.At one moment when the Katy Perry song kept recurring I wondered if she actually played the hot CIA lady Agent Lacey, but actually it was Lizzy Caplan just looking perfectly like Katy. The Korean members play marvellous and I am glad so many actors agreed to work on this film. I guess they understood it is about comedy a la ""Team America"" and not about making fun about real Korean people. There is a fun fact about the secret distribution of the film in Korea. Check the trivia section for that.It is disappointing that the distributers in USA hestitated to show the film and this is why it was a financial desaster. Sony actually got hacked and was critisized by Koran politicians. Nevertheless you can stream the movie now on demand and you should give it a shot for a good laugh.

Music way too loud. The montage part is boring too.This movie is flat.16 minutes gone and I am yarning already.. 90 minutes left :(

I guess it is because they speak nonsense and try so hard and sweat a lot to try to be funny.Aaah so flat story and boring.It so painful to watch I would not ask only the price of my movie ticket back, they should pay me for this torture to watch. Maybe I should take that extasy as well to enjoy a bit.When I think no lower than this they just put a pile on it.Just more unrealistic and anfunnier than before.Dramaturgy is flat, director and writer is weak.Too much cut as usual. Special effects overdone as the sounds too.Meh:(

Those are uncomfortable to watch. But not this, not by a long shot.This was actually pretty okey. It wasn't some crappy humor at all, but a comedy trying to be realistic, as much as it can be for a satirical comedy. I've had quiet a few loud laughs. And I was surprised it was actually very entertaining from the beginning to the end.I'm thinking these bad reviews either come from the North Koreans, the Chinese or people who were expecting something on a Lord Of The Rings level masterpiece.Watch and enjoy!",The Interview

And it would be a bonus if Sony could find a way to e-mail a digital copy to every human being in North and South Korea.

Every last bit of performance was pathetic. And I was only starting to like these two. At first I thought the hacking threats were real, but now I'm having my fair share of doubt.

232,agblum,"Laughed 2-3 Times, but for the most part - Stupid.",6,2 January 2015,"It was about 8 days post release, but I did finally see the movie the hackers and or the North Korean Government never wanted us to see – ""The Interview"" - The satire comedy, starring Seth Rogen (also Co-Director and Co-Writer) and James Franco. Franco plays Dave Skylark, host of the talk show ""Skylark Tonight"" and Rogen plays Skylark's producer and friend Aaron Rapoport. The show is centered around celebrity interviews and gossip. Long story short, word comes to Skylark that North Korean leader and Dictator Kim Jong-Un is a fan of his show. Rapoport wants to do more ""serious"" stories, so when Skylark suggests trying to arrange an interview with Jong-Un, after about a minute of persuasion, Rapoport says yes. The interview is arranged, which will be scripted by Jong- Un's Communist Government, to take place in North Korea. As you probably read or saw in the trailers, Skylark and Rapoport are contacted by U.S. Government Agents, to recruit the two to use this opportunity to assassinate the dictator, which via a means (will save the spoiler here) will not trace back to them. Putting aside what a big new story/controversy, the previous decision to not release this film by Sony, as the big name theater chains opted not to, fearing threat of violent attack, to Sony's decision to release it in a number of smaller theaters, that were willing to show it, and on-line for a fee - How was the movie? I expected to be very stupid and or silly. I admit, I laughed 2 or 3 times, but for the most part, it is what I expected – I found it stupid. A lot of the jokes and characters are cliché. Franco's character is very over the top. Yes – It is a satire, but I think it was overdoing it a bit, and there are small spots in the movie, particularly for Rogen's character, where I feel it is not trying to be a satire, so it needed more consistency there. I liked Franco in Rami's Spider-Man movies as Harry Osborne. As I wrote, his character in this movie I found for the most part, a bit too much. There was one bit in the movie which is incredibly predictable, and just isn't funny in the end, due mostly to it being predictable. Again, I did laugh a few times, so it could have been a lot worse, but I can't say it is a great comedy. Mel Brooks, the famous Director/Writer/Actor of satire and spoof movies was recently asked about the controversy surrounding the movie on Jimmy Kimmel, I believe prior to the decision to go ahead and release it, and joked ""I waited until Hitler was dead"", referencing the Comedy ""The Producers"", the first movie he ever directed, and won a Screen writing Oscar for it, released in 1967, eventually turned into a Broadway Musical decades later, which involves a couple of Broadway Producers trying to make a musical about Hitler. I think Brooks could have taken the concept of ""The Interview"", and made a very funny movie, or if it was made as a Black Comedy, in the vain of Stanley Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"", which satirized cold war fears, I think it would have been more effective. I am glad I saw it, as to not let these Hackers/North Korea, etc., dictate what I can and can't see (I do respect all points of view - OK – end of political comment here), but as for the movie itself – for the most part – not very good – 2 out of 4 Stars – 6 out of 10.",The Interview

234,briand6465,Controversy Is Comedy,8,3 January 2015,"Saw The Interview starring James Franco and Seth Rogen today online. Franco plays ""Dave Skylark"" a tabloid show host and ""Aaron Rapoport"" played by Rogen is his producer for their celebrity tabloid show, ""Skylark Tonight."" ""Rapoport"" is tired of covering entertainment news interviews and wants a change to the show. It's always been ""Skylark"" and ""Rapoport's"" dream to land a big-time interview, so when they find out that Kim Jong-un is a big fan of their show, they do everything in their given power to make it happen for the world to see.When the Central Intelligence Agency finds out that they land this interview, ""Agent Lacey"" played by Lizzy Caplan and ""Agent Botwin"" played by Reese Alexander are sent to meet with ""Skylark"" and ""Rapoport"" to plan their trip to Pyongyang, Korea and their assassination mission which goes hilariously wrong.Overall, the movie was funny and action-packed, no doubt and featured a bunch of other celebrities including Eminem, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Rob Lowe, among others; but being that the theme was to assassinate the leader of North Korea, there were many reasons including that one which sparked such a controversy. I can see why there was all the buzz and controversy surrounding the movie; everything from the alleged Sony Pictures hack by North Korea and obviously the media played a major role in hyping the movie up to the point where it still could have been released nation-wide and potentially could have made even more money, but instead was only in limited theaters because of public safety concerns and also online to view.We supposedly live in The United States, a country of free speech; so if someone doesn't like something on television or on the radio, please change the channel and don't watch or listen, but we cannot continue to live in a censored country and still consider it ""Free.""

It is we who underestimate him as a bad person.That said, let's get back to reality. And useless, Seth Rogen and James Franco are the new gods of 21st century American comedy.

237,jmcd2007,A Subpar Film with a Satisfying Ending,6,26 December 2014,"Although not half as funny as originally promoted to be, ""The Interview"" is a nice effort from Sony Pictures, who cancelled, then brought back the film after taking heat from North Korean officials, who were then accused by the U.S. of being behind the recent attack on Sony Pictures shortly after announcing its release to theaters. After much criticism from moviegoers and even Obama concerning freedom of speech, Sony made the decision to release the film to a handful of independently owned theaters and also through certain online streaming services.Overall, the film is a political satire that follows entertainment reporter Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapoport (Seth Rogen). Both men have been working together for years and, at times, seem to have more than just a ""BFF"" kind of relationship, yet express almost the same feelings for the opposite sex. In any case, they soon develop a plan to interview North Korea's ""Supreme Leader"" Kim Jong-Un, most likely in an effort to boost their ratings, after Un makes a decision to launch a nuclear missile toward the United States. Not long after, Skylark and Rapoport's decision makes international headlines, while also attracting the attention of C.I.A. Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) who tells them the the U.S. government would like them to ""take out"" Kim Jong-Un while there. Stunned by her response, the two are in disbelief and refuse to do so until Agent Lacey takes a more serious tone with them. Several awkward moments later, complete with a barrage of sex jokes and innuendo galore, Rapoport meets a tough as nails North Korean government official named Sook (Diana Bang), who later breaks down and falls for him later in the film. Not long after, both Skylark and Rapoport are flown into North Korea. Skylark, at one point, starts to befriend Kim Jong-Un after spending time with him, but soon realizes that Kim is not all what he's cracked up to be after witnessing his violent outburst about American culture during a meeting with his fellow government officials. Somewhere in between, one of Un's men dies after unknowingly eating a ""ricin patch"" (instead of chewing gum) that was given to Skylark and Rapoport by Agent Lacey. In actuality, the patch was really intended for Un, who was expected to be poisoned after Skylark or Rapoport shook his hand. Add to the fact that Skylark's fears about North Korea's malnourished state are confirmed when he walks into a ""grocery store"" only to discover that Un has lied to him and that the ""store"" is nothing but a prop, complete with fake fruit and vegetables.Knowing this information, on the day of the internationally televised interview, Skylark stays on Un's designated scripted questions for a while, but then goes off the cuff when asking Un why he doesn't feed his people. Un is infuriated over this and has an emotional meltdown on live television after Skylark mocks him for liking Katy Perry's song ""Firework"" and also compares Un to a weak ""plastic bag."" Soon, we find that most of Un's men feel betrayed by their once strong leader, who now view him as weak and powerless. By now, North Korean official Sook soon joins the fight against Un, who along with her new friend Rapoport, order North Korean officials to not cut the feed to the interview. Infuriated and embarrassed, Un loses it and shoots Skylark, leaving him to presumably die, and then flees the scene. However, Skylark soon gets back up on his feet and mentions to the audience that he is wearing a bullet proof vest. By now, Un has escaped to his helicopter and orders his men to launch their nuclear arsenal and to kill Skylark and Rapoport. Skylark and Rapoport, along with Sook, stumble upon one of Un's North Korean military tanks, which they use to bring down Kim Jong-Un's helicopter just before he launches his nuclear weapons, with Un suffering a fiery death, which actually had to be toned down at the request of Sony executives. Skylark and Rapoport are then escorted to a tunnel where they are instructed by Sook to go through so that they can exit North Korea. Sook refuses to go with them per Rapoport's request, saying that she'd feel better staying in her own country. (After Un's death, Sook is later revealed to be the new leader of North Korea). Skylark and Rapoport oblige and they end up being greeted by, what at first, appear to be North Korean soldiers, but are really American soldiers in disguise. They are brought back home as heroes and the movie ends. So in conclusion, although not a perfect film (and some overacting from James Franco), it was certainly well worth the risk to re-release this as the film itself has generated the most publicity I've seen out of Hollywood in years...probably ever. In my opinion, this is also a first for Hollywood as well, considering the fact that they have never made a movie like this on North Korea. Oh and as much as I dislike North Korea's current leader, props to Randall Park for pulling off a convincing Kim Jong-un, too.",The Interview

Say what you will about its film's very nutty wingnut politics, the humor here is nonstop, like Family Guy and its very finest and most manic, layering one joke upon another and then repeating them over and over, each time with a new and wilder spin. This, and not the moronic ""Ted"" or the empty ""Million Ways to Die in the West"" is the film Seth MacFarlane should have made, and James Franco and Steve Rogan can now claim to be the rightful heirs to his sex / potty humor / politics / wtf throne.

Well written, interesting plot. I couldn't believe it was almost 2 hours long, because the time went so fast when watching it. I was happy to contribute $5.99 to the makers of the film through YouTube rental application. I'm definitely going to buy a blu-ray copy if they release it. So glad that the threats of the hackers didn't stop this film from being released. It really was a cute funny comedy. Some great gore and nudity. Funny drug references. The guy who played Kim Jung Un was awesome. The movie far exceeded my expectations. Lots of laughs and interesting all the way through.

The entire premise was ill conceived from the beginning and I wasn't able to glean even the slightest idea of what the intention of this movie was. If it was to be funny it failed. If it was to make some social or political statement it really failed. James Franco was just pointless as Dave Skylark and Seth Rogen as Aaron Rapoport was Seth Rogen with a different name. The dialogue was slow, witless and really kind of silly. These characters where zero charisma idiots. The government agents who intercept the arranged interview with Kim Jong Un and try to use the opportunity to facilitate his assassination where so pathetically unbelievable, even for a would be comedy.

Always by his side is his best friend and producer Aaron Rapaport played by Seth Rogen. While very successful in there own style of programing, Aaron wishes to do more hard hitting 60 minutes style journalism. Dave eventually discovers that Kim Jong-un (Randall Park) the North Korean Dictator is a fan of their program, and Aaron manages to arrange an interview. When word gets out, the CIA becomes involved and devises a plan for the two to kill Kim Jong-un with Ricin. Thank you Breaking Bad. Well in case you have been living under a rock or an evil North Korean dictator you have undoubtedly heard of all the controversy surrounding this film. North Korea hacking Sony pictures, airing everyones dirty laundry. Cyber terrorists threaten the release of the opening. The theaters refuse to release the film amidst the threat of terrorist attacks. Alamo Theaters in response releases showings of Team America: World Police (2004); a film that took heat for its portrayal for Kim Jong-il. The release of Team America was blocked by the studio. Eventually the Interview is released online and at select theaters. I find it very fitting that the Alamo is the theater that has the courage to release the film. The Alamo being an iconic symbol of American bravery. Remember the Alamo indeed. The theater had a special drink and dinner menu for the show, offering things like loaded Freedom Fries and red white and blue milkshakes. Before the movie rolled there were clips from North Korean television programs, as a means to demonstrate the North Korean dislike for Americans. Alongside that they showed Franco and Rogen's Kanye West Youtube video parody, for levity. Immediately before the movie ran, there was a short video message from Seth Rogan, Evan Goldberg and James Franco, congratulating the audience and Alamo for being brave, free Americans; a very funny and fitting touch. The film itself was exactly like I had imagined. Pineapple Express (2008) with a shallow political message, never deeper than our two favorite bumbling stoner buddies will allow us to go. Predictable to satisfying perfection. I think with the amount of times we have seen Rogen and Franco together, we get the dynamic of their relationship. Franco a wide- eyed narcissistic pretty boy with a devil may care attitude, and Rogen the slightly more intelligent strait man who continues to let Franco talk him in to crazy schemes. The comedy team is as classic as Abbot and Costello or Bing Crosby and Bob Hope's road movies. If you were on board for Superbad (2007), Pineapple Express (2008) and This is the End (2013) you will love this movie. If you are interested in seeing it just for the notoriety of the controversy, you might want to pass. The soundtrack, minus the over play of Katy Perry's Firework for comedic effect was good. There is a very fitting inclusion of David Bowie and Trent Reznor's, I'm Afraid of Americans, worth mentioning. Its a wonder if now with the hype surrounding this movie, more of the world will take notice of it. Could this have been the most elaborate viral marketing campaign ever? And what message does this send the rest of the world about our culture? Has America's chief export become raunchy, sophomoric sex comedies packed with dick and fart jokes? Its ironic that this is the foot we are currently leading with to celebrate our right to free speech in America. But free speech is not always about popular speech. As Evelyn Beatrice Hall wrote about the philosophy of Voltaire ""I may disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"". Watching the Interview helps remind us about whats great about being an American, your right to free speech and to see this film. Freedom rang in that dark theater, echoing melodiously along with giggles from Franco's explanation of haters; ""Hate us because they ain't us"". ""Ain't us"" sounding like anus of course.

Why James Franco wants to waste his talents on this kind of throwaway unfunny formulaic rubbish...the story is not only funny but every arc of it is seen coming long ahead of time.The only redeeming feature is knowing that when you get to the credits you don't have any more of it to sit through.Movie studios, i beg of you, stop letting Seth Rogen near any equipment than can be used to make a movie.",The Interview
253,powell-yendi,A Hilarious play on the Dumb & Dumber theme!,10,25 December 2014,"We've seen this theme many times before, particularly in Dumb & Dumber. James Franco plays a quirky airhead, and Seth Rogen plays his Jiminy Cricket who has mastered the art of delivering sarcasm. In the early parts of the movie, every millisecond was hilarious. For the first hour, I was showered with a joke per 30 seconds, and I wanted more time to laugh and recover before receiving the next joke. Towards the end it became a little more serious but the special effects were a jaw-dropping distraction from the lack of hilarity. The cinematography was beautiful with a lot of photograph worthy scenes. I would not recommend this movie for children or conservative Christians since there is a lot of cursing and sexually explicit language. This is definitely a young adult film filled with raunchy humor, like The Hangover. 10/10",The Interview

255,ericzillazillo,Hilarious and entertaining,9,25 December 2014,"If you expected serious social commentary, this film has little of that. But by f*ck it was funny.If you've seen Team America or any comedy short concerning North Korea at all, this film is like that but full length, with lots of cool action, humor and decent acting.There's some critique of North Korea based on real life facts, but nothing you haven't heard before. But, there are also many jokes and gags expertly interwoven into the plot. Given all the terrorist threats etc surrounding its release, I'd say the film lives up to the hype.The lead duo consists of an egotistical and stupid but charismatic host of an entertainment show played by James Franco, and his trusty sane sidekick director person played by Seth Rogen, but the star of the show is certainly Randall Park, who albeit doesn't look anything like Kim Jong Un, portrays a heartfelt, charming version of Un not unlike the Il of Team America.The comedy succeeds more than it fails, and did I mention there are some cool action scenes? Overall, the film is pretty darn good and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have another good laugh at the abysmal state of North Korea.",The Interview

I laughed twice, and both times were at the great delivery by the two main Korean characters, played by Randall Park and Diana Bang.Franco over-acts an implausibly stupid journalist, and Rogen his uninteresting, overly cautious producer. The movie jumps back and forth between appallingly dumb humor, extreme violence using low-quality effects, and shallow political commentary.What a pile. To think there are people who are seeing this out of some misguided sense of patriotism. It's embarrassing.",The Interview

Super Bad was a great movie but some of the same slapstick is used in this film and is ""been done, laughed that.""The ruler of Korea was not upset that the film made him look like an idiot, Kim Jong-Un is ticked because he did not laugh at all watching this. The reason this film went straight to Netflix was because it was terrible.

259,boatista24,Lame and a total waste of time,1,25 December 2014,"This is just the latest crapola from Roegen and Franco. These two jerks have made nothing but turkeys and this film is exactly what one would expect from them. It is lame, tacky and tiresome, not to mention totally dull and unfunny. I think these two hacks have got something wrong with them to consistently keep creating crap - as well as the Hollywood cretins who keep financing such hogwash. Another hack is Seth McFarlane who makes dumb, lame, crapola as well. Clearly there is a trend here, but I'm not sure if it's just their lack of writing ability to come up with something that's actually funny, or if they really think this septic garbage IS actually funny - when nobody else does - the exception being juveniles who think they're supposed to find it so. I got not one laugh out of the whole movie and found large portions of it just downright annoying. Perhaps they think that needling an audience is the humor in itself. But I've got news for you turkey writers, if that's the case, it's only funny to you. And eventually, your audiences will get disappointed too many times to bother wasting anymore time on your inane crap. In fact, I had no intention of wasting any time on this latest doo-doo fest if it hadn't been for the fiasco that preceded its release. The only neat thing about this movie was the advertising campaign. That's how you sell a movie that's a stinker - with a publicity stunt - a trick as old as the hills, and just as transparent as the vacant seats at the theaters will be the next time these idiots produce more garbage. I got more amusement out of the Sony hack than this dimwitted tripe. If the North Koreans had bothered to view the movie they got so upset about, they would have seen there was no insult to anyone except the makers of this film.",The Interview

""Playing music is supposed to be fun. It's about heart, it's about feelings, moving people, and something beautiful, and it's not about notes on a page. I can teach you notes on a page, I can't teach you that other stuff.""

261,johntheholder,"Thumbs up on "" the interview"" !!",8,27 December 2014,"I was prejudiced and almost certain that this would be a bad film. And that the high rating is only a result of the Americans pride over this scandal and nothing more. Plus most new films get absurdly good ratings over here , whereas in reality the films are garbage or close to that. It might be that many ""kids"" have accounts on IMDb or that the average viewer lacks good taste. But still , i had to satisfy my curiosity over this , and so i watched it last night.They say that you can tell a good film just from the opening scene.Well this film started so good i couldn't believe my eyes. I thought to myself , ""wait they are going to mess it up. No way its that good."" So i continued watching , getting more amazed and still disbelieving my eyes. I was certain there would be a decline , no way it remains that good.It took a while until i settled and said to myself "" OK it really is that good. Its not going to screw it up , so just sit back , and enjoy"" .And thats what i did. I knew that Seth Rogen had a good taste in modern comedy and has contributed in the genre despite the fact that because of his success , he has lately been into a few bad films indeed. Any person who watches this , must already know that these type of comedies aren't the classical conservative ones like say Woody Allen's or Billy Wilder's. To them , this might be total garbage. You need to have a grasp on modern comedy and "" what the world has come to"". I think that today via the internet we see all kinds of absurdities , and this is a vital reason that for a comedy to reach the absurd level in an original way , might have to go even more absurd , competition being already high. So to an eye that doesn't really know what modern man sees on the internet... a pristine eye that reads books and listens to "" good music""and curses the modern world , i do sympathize with this person but he will not understand why they write films this way nowadays. To their eyes , this will be garbage.To everyone else , who's followed the ""evolution"" or decline on film and comedies , they will understand this film and in my opinion they will enjoy it.It is very entertaining which is a universal tool for success in film.Its Rogen's best film along with Knocked up , Zack and Miri make a porno and Superbad.I won't exaggerate and put it on top of those. But it is as good as those films. You should know that its only a film and i personally don't really know what scheme lies behind this and the reasons and mechanics for the mass media scandalous demonstrations and ""terrorist"" hoaxes and all that.Erase all that , say to yourself "" i am just watching a film"" and enjoy.As far as the movie goes : James Franco plays the role really good , Rogen's role is good too and in general the acting is fine. Direction is fine , photography is great , music score is just great for this type of movie. It is true that script-wise there is somewhat strong politician background and theme and certainly this is why a scandal has risen.It was revolutionary to spread this sort of ideas , despite many of us know about those things and the plots that do happen even in reality.The script is bold in this way , offering scenes that truly live up to modern man's expectations of absurdity ( and reality) .It criticizes both the American side of attending other countries matters and Capitalism , and also the oppressive Stalinist type of communism.I like politics and so i liked that they were honest about it , and just recorded such scenes on camera. Because the world is really as bold and absurd as that , and in this way it shows the hypocrisy of governments not really telling us all the business they are doing.To end this ,go see this IF! you are into this kind of comedies. Then you'll certainly like this one. Thumbs up again!",The Interview

263,sreethered,Neighbours< The Interview< This Is The End,5,28 December 2014,"In simplest terms, this movie's validity can be explained from the above formula. Seth Rogen's formula of sexist jokes and eccentric plot lines fails to amuse me by each film. The earlier one, Neighbours, was so pathetic, that it even questioned his future products. Interview, though it is better than Neighbours, is not free from the clutches of this formula. In fact, he concentrated on penning racist jokes, along with his awkward numbers. Following the footsteps of 'The Great Dictator', one of the most brilliant political satire, this one questions the dictatorship in North Korea, without a single moment of brilliance to remember. Even though it is a below average effort from a comedic combo which made some good movies, it never dwell into the status of a unbearable one, and that's a relief....",The Interview

There was not even many pee pee and poop jokes, but it was nice and I smiled a bit.Then it started. Oh boy!The second half is tense and suspense-packed and thrilling.It's a very cool movie with super music tracks and I enjoyed it throughout the whole time. I think, it has a message too and people, who think, it is just about blatantly killing a man are wrong.Exactly the opposite is true. They try to solve the problem with logic and humanity, but it's the nature of comedies, that everything goes wrong.The actor playing the supreme leader is amazing. He was able to be sympathetic if he wanted, but also very unsympathetic where he needed to be.Kim Jong-un has one of the coolest dying scene ever in cinema history. I think, it is no secret, that he dies. I put a spoiler on top of my review anyway.I would have given a strong 6 for this movie, because the lack of intelligent humor, but I added 2 points for the thrill and for what this movie stands for now.Watch this movie and please, pay for it!

Gimme a break, people.It was just a funny movie, and, as funny movies go, I thought it was just about perfect. I liked all the characters, where I tend to think the characters in a lot of comedies are just plain stupid. Some of these characters are goofy, but not stupid.

This ain't the film to make that point.There have been lots of jokes and mocking about Kim Jong Un but having the U.S. government plotting to assassinate him was bound to have repercussions and I hope they hit Sony and the 2 leads hard. When a country with nukes and a super proud dictator doesn't 'get' the joke and retaliates by hacking your computer system, the 'joke' is on you. Think about it. This movie dragged the FBI and the attention of the President into its stupidity. Sony should reimburse the FBI for any costs it incurred investigating the hacking.It was plainly irresponsible to make this movie knowing full well what the subject matter is and who we're dealing with.Free speech doesn't exist everywhere on the planet and if it can backfire on Americans within the country who have spoken unwisely in public, it can do even worse by foreign enemies who have no restraints on their behavior.It's like pulling on a lion's tail and whining when he rips your throat out. If only it would ruin Sony and end the careers of the 2 leads, it would be worth all the problems it caused.Oh, I didn't see the movie. Did you have to actually see it to know how bad it would be?

Nobody acted badly in a way it would've annoyed you, so thats just good acting. The scenery was actually pretty good. really liked the set and all the props used for this movie. the actual comedy was pretty good. the cameos in the beginning were hilarious! The whole plot was pretty funny.. the way it played out was even more so. James Franco killed it! I thought he was so good playing such a gullible character.It was a funny and exciting ride and did not bore(and a lot of comedies this year did)So all in all, great acting, also great camera work btw, funny content and exciting and fun!I give it an 7.5/10 which when rounded in whole numbers id rather push to an 8 rather than pushing it back to a 7..One of the funniest comedies this year, though it didn't have much competition!",The Interview

I literally am more American than I was before I watched this glorious piece of cinematic history. And I was already 8th generation white. The female lead was amazing for a Korean, and I can totally see where Korean people might think she's attractive.I just know that if there is a sequel, it will break more box office records than this movie has.

With that in mind, it's fun for what it is.I see other user reviews comparing this weakly to other Franco/Rogen movies, but I have seen none of them so I don't have that gauge to measure by.By now you know the plot (and the meta real life drama it created) so I won't rehash. Instead, random impressions: beautifully photographed; a surprise there. The guy playing Kim Jong-un was too handsome and masculine to accurately portray the real guy, but OK. Diana Bang was actually kinda brilliant in her switching demeanors between ice-cold officious and guard-down horny, winning the best moments of the film in her reaction to Rogen's bare chest and the shot of her giddy and vicious as she shot a massive gun thru a door. And really, that's about it. Oh, and a particular shot getting me to aloud shout ""OHHH!!!"" when a tank ran over a jeep (there's more to it than just that). But maybe that's a guy moment only we would ""enjoy.""

I would have really appreciated a bit more action to and James Francos character was too much of a idiot, even for the premise of this movie. It also might feel a bit predicable to some people, since you will notice several instances of Chekhov's Gun, before they are used in the third act.

They say Seth Rogen is a bad actor and that the jokes are terrible. I say yes and no. No, Seth is an amazing actor in this movie, and yes, the jokes are terrible, terribly good!

American people have recovered from this complex, but Hollywood still not. To be fair this movie fabricates a lot of things about N.Korea. Some scenes are low & cheap comedy like when Aaron hides the bullet in his hole. The movie is a strong promotion of gay.

It was never supposed to be.Given the category this movie belongs to, it's funny and - don't laugh - surprisingly thought provoking. I was expecting Kim's character to be a one-dimensional caricature of a crazed villain a la Dr. Evil. Instead, the movie constructs an - albeit exaggerated - lovable sociopath. If movies like ""Austin Powers"" deserve 7+ stars, ""The Interview"" does too. Poking fun at ""the American way"" of assassinating dictators? Suggesting it may not be the best approach?

If you don't pay attention to Debbie downers and nay sayers who have nothing better to do other than bashing anything they watch from the comfort of their armchairs, you might actually have a good time watching this movie.While I admit that the recent publicity helped this movie draw more attention than it would get otherwise, I can assure you that it is not the worst movie ever made. The humor is unbalanced at certain points and it can get quite repetitive but there are some scenes that made me laugh out loud, especially Seth's scene with the tiger and the electronic device.I couldn't figure out why these armchair critics are bashing the acting so much, because the casting is phenomenal. The chemistry of Rogen and Franco is on par with Diana Bang (Sook) and Randall Park (Kim Jong- Un) and their performances are simply amazing.If you really want to see a movie that is fun to watch, then I'd recommend The Interview. The film knows that its premise is ridiculous, therefore it doesn't take itself seriously at all. Never it claims that it has Oscar worthy material so I have no idea from where these critics are coming up with that. There is also some well done gore, which adds extra flavor on top of what it offers to us.Go see it. It's only five bucks and you don't even need to leave the comfort of your house.

I don't know if it was because of the premise or poor execution, but the Rogen brand of humor just didn't work on this one.This movie would have been 10 times better if Craig Robinson and Danny McBride had roles.

Putting what my ideologies aside, I don't believe democracy is the panacea to any problem. The flourishing of a country depends heavily on the leadership of its authority; as long as the leaders are capable, any system would work out.The jokes in the film is evidently helpless. The element of wit is usually absent in Seth Rogen's works. Instead, profanities and sexual innuendos are devices for him to trigger laughter in the audience. May this method is highly appreciated in the US, but for me such an approach only highlights the lack of ingenuity.The professionalism of Hollywood movies like visual effects, camera angle and excellence of acting clumsily endeavour to generate a smooth flow for the film.

You know that commercial entertainment, visible on screens large and small?The only thing unusual about it is that some jumped crazy dictator doesn't like it because it takes the mickey out of him.It was fun, an hour and a half not wasted (well debatable) but in all I enjoyed it. Haven't been let down by Seth Rogan yet! Not going to win an Oscar but it is in the long tradition of dropping your trousers and holding up a brown eye mirror to nasty powerful politicians everywhere.",The Interview

Moreover, James Franco's eyes looked like he had prepared to be in Cheech and Chong's ""Up in Smoke"" instead of this film. This guy is just not funny, in fact he becomes annoying and seems to be at ""his own party"" throughout the whole film. If I was Kim Jong what's his face, I would want the world to see this film. Yer man Seth Rogen just isn't funny anymore. The only redeeming quality of the film was Randall Park however I hope for his sake this film doesn't bring down his career. All in all I would rather watch paint dry than have to sit through this rubbish again.Awful awful awful...",The Interview
287,miruleyall,Worst comedy i have ever seen,1,24 December 2014,"Lets get this out of the way first.Sony DORPPED this movie because it was a complete turd, right after the screenings and critic/audience reviews... coincidence? This is the biggest marketing stunt since all those terrible post 911 movies Hands down this is the stupidest most insensitive movie ever made. Its not even funny its so unfunny that i cant even laugh at how bad it is the entire movie is cringe worthy and cheaply made to boot.Rogan and Franco egos are so large you can barely watch the movie without cringingPlease god don't watch or pay for this pile of crap it is the most unfunny movie i have seen this year and probably this decade even little man was barely better",The Interview
288,abeburnett,Transformative,10,24 December 2014,"As others have pointed out, this isn't a perfect film. It isn't satire or parody, it is something else--a deeper film lodged in the core of a crude over-the-top comedy. You'll laugh a bit, be entertained throughout, and surprisingly...think. After I finished watching it, I found myself thinking that films like this that poke at monsters under the bed are important. We need films like this which aren't afraid to go after the big fish and skewer them. We could argue that we need films like this even more than we need the more serious fare which no one watches. I don't know for certain, but I suspect that a film like this, if seen by enough North Koreans, could upset the status quo there. Regardless of whether North Korea is behind the Sony hack or not, they have good reason to fear movies like this. So overall, a good film (as a comedy I'd probably give it a C+ or B), but as a statement of our freedom of speech it's priceless. I'm glad to see Sony supporting a film like this which is so politically touchy. It's one thing to make action movies about bad Russian, Chinese, North Korean, or Middle Eastern bad guys, but it's entirely another to make light of them. I let my perfect 10 rating stand for all this film is and represents.",The Interview
289,ipoweri,A childish comedy that should provoke no one,3,8 February 2015,"It's ironic that the best satire in this movie is about how western media are obsessed with very uninteresting things, like if some celebrities sexual orientation etc. The movie reminds me of how the last 7-8 seasons of South Park have been like. Childish humour pretending to be ""smart"" and ""satiric"" when in fact it's simply childish humour as the satire are so poorly done it has no actual message or point of reflection. Lizzy Caplan does a good job as a agent having to deal with idiots like Dave and Aaron and in my opinion she is an underrated and charming actress. Diana Bang and Seth Rogen are also acting decent. But other than that, the acting is sub-standard, especially from Randall Park (who plays Kim Jung Un) and James Franco. You just don't buy it for one single second that he is Kim Jung Un, but that could be partly due to poor directing...Here are the main problems with this movie:# The characters are not well defined. Especially Dave Skylark. At some points he seem to be severely intellectually challenged while at other points he seems to be deeply intelligent. # The plan they have to ""take him out"" is not even remotely believable.# The movie assumes the world revolve around USA and US culture. # Why they would be in need of constant radio communication with the US is weird and should be a huge liability considering they are in one of the most monitored places in the world... But OK I can buy it that it made it a bit more fun since it resulted in some nice dialogue... # There is way to many times rather low volume talking are followed by very loud music, forcing you to use the volume control way to many times. I don't want to disturb my neighbours with some sudden crap music, thank you very much. # A lot of bad music # Massive plot holes/too stupid to bother ignoring (and yes I do know that a comedy like this are allowed to have quite a lot but some are still worth mentioning since they are either so big or important for the entire plot) such as:1. When Dave Skylark enters the room where Aaron Rapaport and Agent Lacey are getting intimate. Why would Aaron not simply tell Dave that she is there, when there is such an obvious risk he may reveal their plan? Come on! 2. They sneak out of their room to get more ricin bandage and they want him to stand exactly where the ""missile"" is suppose to land. Yet it later shows that it had enough kinetic energy to kill a tiger? So in other words, had it not been for the Tiger, Aaron could easily had been killed. So the Tiger saved his life? 3. If Kim Jung Un would ever agree to do an interview with a western media, there is no way he would agree that it could be sent live, which makes much of the concept unbelievable to start with. 4. Why didn't Aaron simply go to the toilet and remove the bandage before he got more intimate with Lacey? It's not like it would seem suspicious. the only time I laughed during this movie was at this:(Aaron lying on his stomach in a field in the dark while Dave is in his room and Agent Lacey on speaker from the USA):Aaron: There is a tiger. Dave: It's a f**king tiger. Agent Lacey: It's a f**king tiger. Aaron: Yes, a tiger. Dave: You f***king let my friend into a tiger patch? Agent Lacey: Well I told you there were tigers there. Aaron: Guys, I don't feel happy right now (partly inaudible)Dave: Look, it's really dark out there, it probably doesn't see you.Aaron: Oh, it f***king sees me. Agent Lacey: It has night vision.Aaron: They have night vision? Dave: (Screaming): That tiger has night vision goggles??? Agent Lacey (firm response): It doesn't have night vision goggles! It just naturally has night vision.So if you didn't think that was funny at all, this movie has more ore less nothing to offer you as unlike how it has been presented in media, it does not steer up any questions or political concern, it's just a hyped comedy with no depth.",The Interview

291,hamoo,wasn't a waste of time - i actually liked it,8,25 December 2014,"i'm really not into stupid comedies, but i liked this one mainly because (contrary to other reviews) this one is based on a real person, so you could also classify it as historical fiction. you can't hardly go wrong with historical fiction. i didn't have high expectations, and i haven't seen the other movies; This IS The End, Pineapple Express, Team America: World Police that are being compared to this movie, so for me, it was a novelty. it was new and exciting. the reason i didn't give it a 10 is mainly because i didn't appreciate the homosexual innuendos. if you want to call me a homophobe, i'm OK with it, but i would like to propose an alternative theory that sony is trying to push their homosexual agenda on the public. maybe gay people constitute a significant percentage of their audience. it doesn't matter. my second objection to the movie is that it paints a one dimensional political potemkin village of America exactly like the fake grocery store in the movie. that is to say that America and capitalism are the origin of every single malfunction in this world. for example, the movie condemns hunger and starvation in north Korea, but doesn't touch on the subject of obesity in America. sony had the opportunity to slam our American culture on the interview, but only touched on the fact that America has the highest per capita incarceration statistics in history. i guess people who can afford to go to the movies constitute a significant percentage of people that are brainwashed by cnn and fox news and think that this country is beyond reproach or that its politicians have the right to act with impunity. that is to say, for a political comedy, or historical fiction, the history and politics weren't there. kim jong-un was portrayed as a charismatic intellectual. that type of person just doesn't go belly up. there should have been a counterstrike in the actual interview portion of ""the interview"". whatever; that's enough of that rave, but it's the reason i didn't give it one more star. i don't want this review to come off overly critical, because i'm just pointing out the flaws. the bottom line is that i couldn't have done a better job. it was actually thought provoking. the music/soundtrack and cinematography were first rate. i'm glad i had the time to see it.",The Interview

Is it the best film ever? No. It's the standard Rogen/Franco fare with some pretty decent jokes and an entertainingly over the top climax. The highlight of the film (for Me) was Randall Park's performance as Kim Jong Un. Park plays him as a wildly unpredictable basket-case who is so used to getting what he wants that the second things go sour he plans to instigate Armageddon. Park's scenes easily steal the show, and he comes off as funny, intimidating, crazy, and scary all at once. all in all, a very very funny movie, with some great foreshadowing in the first act and a finale that left me howling.",The Interview

Now, much older, I pick up Mad and don't know what I ever found funny in it. This movie is like Mad, only not as clever and much more coarse. The scripting is poor, the plot predictable, the acting phoned in, and the characterization of Kim as just another misunderstood California stoner an insult to the millions the real ""Supreme Leader"" has killed, starved and terrorized. Rogan and company could have come up with a fictional dictator of a make believe country (as Charlie Chaplin did in ""The Great Dictator,"") and had it make more sense.

294,blades_n_stone,the awful interview,1,2 February 2015,"This review contains spoilers. Awful, absolutely awful. entertainment tonight run by the national enquirer goes to north Korea. And the logistics were conducted by interns. Most of the movie spends its time showing you the main characters are complete idiots. Then spends the rest of its time showing us that north Korea: 1. Is a highly secure nation with a tightly controlled population. 2. Has a strict and detail oriented security force that monitor everything. 3. That The north Korean military/ scientific establishment is a powerful force that is a actual threat to the world 4. That the people of north Korea and the people of Kim's inner circle revere him as a good who does not poop and would never dare disappoint him. The movie also teaches us that: 1. The USA is a celebrity worshiping nation of glamor eyed morons. 2. That the US Military establishment is so important and incompetent that they need celebrities to kill world leaders. 3. That the US is run by a pack of bumbling morons, the military by a grope of violent, challenged school children and That they cannot kill a leader on their own( you know, because they have never installed a puppet dictator before..wink wink)The film makes North Korea look bad ass, The supreme high leader as the pimpest party dictator. and the American nation as a world of fools. This movie should be shown in north Korea. It would scare the people away from working with the USA. I love pineapple express. But Seth Rogan and James Franco should be ashamed of this. This ridiculous farce is no expression of freedom or political justice.

It is never going to win any comedy awards and certainly isn't going to win an Oscar, but I have seen far far worse!Basically if you have seen any other of Seth's films, you will know EXACTLY what you are in for. Ultimately it is what it is.Certainly I cannot see why there is so much vitriol from critics, then again I have to question the judgement of certain critics!As I said I am not a massive Rogen fan, but there were slapstick parts that I did enjoy, and it did have an enjoyable premise.I wont be buying the DVD, but I certainly wont be denouncing it!I give it 7, because it was better than I thought it was going to be!",The Interview

I wonder if they've sent a letter of thanks to Kim Jong-un. Having said that, I see that some newspapers are reporting that North Korea was NOT behind the Sony hack according to multiple security experts who discredit FBI findings and reveal that a studio insider named 'Lena' may be responsible. Hmm!As for the film, it's not a bad film, but then it's not a good one either. I laughed aloud in some parts and cringed in others. The best comedy film I've seen in the last 20 years have to be '3 Idiots', and this is nowhere close to the standard of that.

I wasn't one of them. One thing I learned early on in marketing and advertising, was in order to get the most out of anything, controversy is the icing on the cake. Unfortunately, the rest of the cake didn't taste nearly as good as the faux icing. (Nice try Sony.) Sony had a really good thing going by saying they were 'hacked' and unsubstantiated incredible threats were coming down the pike about the roll-out of this movie. Maybe Sony execs should be charged with misleading the public, including the Federal Government, for gains.Now the movie... It's understandable why Sony went to great lengths to create controversy surrounding The Interview, it is the only way to get the public interested in order to compete with the big holiday releases. Duuuh! In all, like a few other viewers, I think I was halfway through the flick before I cracked a smile. And then it was only short lived at best. With all of the 'hype' surrounding this picture, I was too hung up on wondering why North Korea would even give a damn about this film at all.Sorry readers - Many were taken by a hoax for a move that lacks the bust-out-loud effects that one would expect from a comedy.If anything, North Korea should be commended for trying to thwart the release of this movie - if only they actually tried. (Again, nice try Sony.) If the movie was left alone and released without the controversy, it may have settled well for the viewers.

I have no doubt that the 7.2 rating of this film will drastically drop.But, obviously, when we're all told it's going to be cancelled & we can't watch it - you're going to try your hardest to watch it as an act of solidarity or defiance or whatever.

This film really annoys me because it had so much potential, but at times just ends up trying to find humor in overblown explosions and chases that are funny only cause they are unrealistic. Granted, there are parts I really do like, and I love how they make Kim Jung to be so lovable, just to find out they are being used by him. But of all of these films, there is nothing really memorable about it, and I would probably give it around the 6 range if I had to score it.

That's probably the strongest criticism you can apply to any comedy.Seth Rogan is the worst one character actor in movie history. He basically plays a post modern image of 'Seth Rogan' in every film, and it seems to be getting gradually more absurd.If you have seen any of Rogan's previous films you have nothing to see here. He's just more desperate than ever, so it's actually tinged with a sense of embarrassment for him.How does he continued to make money? I mean, basically he is on a different part of the product life cycle to Adam Sandler, but his trajectory is absolutely identical. Complete one trick pony.I guess he must realise that he has nothing left in the locker now. As a director, as an actor, as a writer - he has had more than a fair go. He either has to transcend that dead beat comedy character and come up with something different and fresh, or it's over - just a matter of time.I long ago vowed never to watch an Adam Sandler vehicle.

It is, what it is - a tongue'n'cheek over-the-top comedy reminiscent of ""Da Ali G"" (which Mr Rogen'Joosh and buddy used to write for). Now if you accept that, it is an enjoyable movie, reasonably directed, reasonably acted, and overall worth your time watching it. You want a serious movie? look elsewhere . . .

304,sweetboyy_99,The Interview: An Actual Honest Review,7,25 December 2014,"The Interview has created a lot of crazy rumors and a lot of things have been making this movie one of the biggest happenings this year. A lot of speculations were made when Sony got hacked and they suspected that North Korea was behind it. This generated a lot of interest for the movie and people were talking about it over and over again. So, after several threats they decided to pull the movie from all theaters. Later on, they decided to release it for streaming purposes, and that's how we finally got to watch the hard work that was put into The Interview.Let's get to the IMDb rating first; they are obviously fakes and there are even people on 4chan telling everyone to rate the movie a 10. This is really just to give the creators of the movie the support and love they need after suffering this sad conflict. Also, it is a great opportunity to actually show movie distribution companies that putting movies earlier to watch at home too streaming, WHILE running in cinema will generate A LOT of money. I got the opportunity to watch this, and I figured, what the heck, it's only 5,99 USD, so why not give it a shot, since everybody is talking about this film. Honest opinion now, a lot of reviews here are fake, by people who has NOT seen the movie. So here's your opportunity to actually read an HONEST review.The movie is in no way perfect by all means, but it does have it's surprisingly funny and shocking moments. Yes, the movie is overloaded with toilet humor and profanity, but it does not necessarily make it a bad movie. I found a lot of the jokes mildly amusing and I chuckled through almost the whole movie with some laugh out loud-moments too. The chemistry between Franco and Rogen is perfect and they always work well together when it comes to acting. The story has set a goal in movie history, and Rogen actually had the ba lls to mock a world leader. I adore Seth's hard work into this movie and I adore everyone else who were part of this project. It's a shame that people get so butt-hurt over a f****nag comedy film. While skeptical about the movie itself, seeing as Rogen's humor is childish and contains a lot of toilet humor and continuous jokes, I found myself enjoying the whole film. The script was very well written, the characters felt real and it had the perfect blend of humor, action and drama. (and a little bit of romance, too) I found both Franco's and Rogen's performance to be flawless and the chemistry they have on screen is wonderful, making this a very believable film. However, I found Franco's character to be a little annoying, but I guess that's what they aimed for. Franco's character felt a little flawed because at one moment, he acted like he was retarded, and then the other second he's starting to act like he's some kind of Sherlock Holmes. This was a minor problem to me, but I kind of wish that they would have worked on Franco's character a little more and made him to be more believable, in my honest opinion he was annoyingly stupid and almost too stupid, even though that was what they were aiming for. They made Seth's character seem so much more intelligent than Franco. I have no idea what they were trying to do but in my personal opinion it always bothered me.The scenes where Franco got to meet Kim Jong Un were truly amazing, but at the same time, quite awkward. Even though Kim is the bad guy, you couldn't help but feel bad for him. They actually made him a misunderstood individual, just like Franco's character, and I found that to be very funny and clever. As for the actor playing Kim, he does an amazing job and he does not waste any of his acting talents. You actually believe him as a person and that makes the movie a sh*t load better. I do not want to spoil the movie for you, but what I can tell you is that this surely is worth a watch at home. I would not have been pleased if it was a theatrical film, but if you're just looking for a funny film, with lots of shock humor, and Rogen humor screaming all over it, this is your choice. Turn of your brain, maybe take a beer and enjoy the movie as it is. Summary: The Interview was a pleasant surprise with believable character development, an interesting plot that only gets better after the second half, with plenty of toilet humor and gags that do not fail to amuse. This will most likely be the most anticipated movie of the year, or at least of 2015, causing the trouble it did, making more people interested in what made this movie so threatening and offensive to North Koreans. Sit down, grab a beer and enjoy. It is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously, meaning you should not take it seriously. It is a great effort from both Rogen and Franco, and I recommend this film to everyone who can actually take a joke AND has a sense of humor, especially those who likes the type of humor Rogen has been featuring these past years.The movie deserves a strong 7 out of 10. Hopefully, the fake ratings will be reset and The Interview will have an average rating of about 7-8.",The Interview
305,theSachaHall,A Stinker Of Dieg(rrh)etic Proportions,2,13 February 2015,"As the cyber-hack attack on Sony Pictures played out (coincidently) in the media in the lead up to THE INTERVIEW's Christmas Day release amid speculation of North Korean involvement, I recall having one recurring thought. That the 'attack' was either an unfortunate event fortuitously timed (for the film that is) or the most outlandishly clever marketing campaign ever orchestrated. Cause let's face it – THE INTERVIEW is a stinker of dieg(rrh)etic proportions - destined for tanking glory had Sony's hyperbole not bolstered it.It's a shame really because Seth Rogen and James Franco have an undeniable comedic chemistry that just resonates from the screen. It makes you want to hang out with them knowing, all the while, that it'll be one of the most entertaining nights out ever, tritely clichéd gag lines be damned.If you look at THE INTERVIEW as a farcical screwball comedy rather than a political satire, the film is more palatable to take. You're expectant of the outrageous and over the top antics and fast-paced repartee of the yin yang central figures –elements you absolutely garner from Rogen and Franco's performances. Rogan plays Skylark Tonight producer Aaron Rapaport who, whilst out celebrating the thousandth episode of his good buddy Dave Skylark's celebritoid show, begins to question his journalistic legitimacy after an industry colleague discredits his professional achievements as a 'sell-out'. In an effort to cheer Aaron up, shallow celebrity tabloid show host and good buddy Dave (Franco), manages to land himself an exclusive interview in Pyongyang with the elusive Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Jong-un (superbly performed by Randall Park), a super-fan of Skylarks' TMZesque show and of America's superficial celebritydom. When news of the coup comes to the attention of the American Government, they send CIA Agents Lacey (played by Lizzy Caplan) and Botwin (played by Reese Alexander) to recruit the slapstick duo and have them assassinate the North Korean leader using a slow- administering poison device.The story gets a bit clunky mid-way particularly, the superfluous scene on the 38th parallel but thankfully, it manages to reorient itself when Skylark meets and develops a bromance with the North Korean leader during their 'one night in Pyongyang' celebration. Props need to go to Park who manages to humanise his brattish and scheming totalitarian character whilst skewering him at the same time.No phallic connotation has gone unturned as THE INTERVIEW comes to its predictable end in a slow-motioned blaze of machismo glory: a manstravaganza of military hardware, bullets, missiles and take that cock thrusting. Although most of us don't mind a bit of bawdiness and potty humour, THE INTERVIEW's homo-erotic comedy sadly, just falls flat. The gags are predictable, lack originality and feel contrived. Sure, you may get a few laughs in but they won't be the belly-hugging guffaws you had on Bakalakadaka Street in TEAM America: WORLD POLICE, at Franco's house in THIS IS THE END, and sexy time with BORAT – now they're bad ass crass at their very best.After suffering through this overrated overrated nonsense, all I can say is 'Intelligence is down. I repeat. We have lost out intelligence'.",The Interview

And that's okay too because that's what we were made to believe and well they did win we did see the film hated or loved it we bought the ticket.

A loose plot, slapstick, and lots of swearing. In other words, just a fun time at the theatre.Of course, having a real person be the antagonist in Kim is going to make the movie a little edgy. Which is why they did it. You know, like Team America: World Police.In other words, check your brain at the door, and then go enjoy. They wanted publicity for this movie? They got it. And all of the low reviews on here show that people went out of their way to see this movie due to the publicity, where they usually would have skipped it.",The Interview
310,oneto-1,My condolences are with North Korea!,1,28 December 2014,"US is a Victim! Really? This movie has only one motive i.e. Propagate ""Kim Jong Un"" is a Maniac and deserves to be dead, else he will blow ""Whole World"". In entire movie almost every actor abusing ""Kim Jong Un"" and making other derogatory, insulting remarks. It's clearly a ""State Funded movie"" to propagate and defame North Korea, Sony production banner is a sham. But Hey! How dare ""Kim Jong Un"" called our beloved President a ""Monkey""? It's Americans who have the authoritative right to abuse others and still play VICTIM. Just accept their allegations else they bomb your country in the name of helping your starving, poor countrymen. Also be ready for collateral damages (read Mass Killing), I sure they have already typed their ""Sorry letter"" showing, how deeply they have shattered on the death of innocent Kids, Women, America has already did this in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Libya etc you can see how happy their citizens are after America ""Rescued"" them. The Interview movie tried to show that with ""American Help"", North Korea can fight with poverty and starvation, but they have to kill ""Kim Jong Un"" first. US is really bothered about North Korean financial condition, but they don't bother about African, South Asian countries etc Some people are coming into defense that it's cool as American are abusing and killing Korean President in the movie as American sometime insult their president too. Well! You can't abuse my parents just because your parents are habitual to your abuses. This is not a valid defense, it's shows how ill mannered you are! Abusing in the name of Freedom of Expression is a new fashion. As far as the movie is concerned, there is no story... just a mission assigned to the whole crew to make a movie showing ""Kim Jong Un"" Assassination, insult him as much as you can, propagate how Evil he is and show Americans are good and kind-hearted, BTW every villain is a Hero in his own eyes! After watching this movie you will know why almost 80% countries in the World Hate American, some openly doing this some playing diplomatic. America don't do this, world need Peace not massacre and war. Live and let live.",The Interview
311,urgentneptune,It Deserves To Be Watched,8,2 January 2015,"The InterviewHere we go boys. If you haven't heard the story behind The Interview, it is one worth looking into. Basically, Sony canceled the theatre release of the movie due to threats they received from an organization that opposed the film. Long story short, Sony released the movie on Youtube, and later on Amazon for people to view in the comfort of their homes. After the trouble this movie went through to get released, I knew I had to watch it, and I'm happy to report that I thoroughly enjoyed it.SPOILERS ahead. PlotThe Interview is the latest ridiculous comedy starring James Franco and Seth Rogen. In it, famous talk show host Dave Skylark (Franco) and his producer Aaron Rapaport (Rogen) travel to North Korea to interview and assassinate Kim Jong-un.Now you know why some people hate this movie. Other than that basic concept, The Interview has a very diverse and hilarious plot line. After the CIA enlists Dave and Aaron, everything goes wrong. Chaos ensues. I think I can best describe the craziness of the plot by describing the beginning middle and end. Beginning: A hilarious interview with EminemMiddle: Basketball with Kim Jong-unEnd: ExplosionsNow if that isn't an interesting list of events, I don't know what is. Plus, the scenes in between those I noted above are all wonderfully executed.What I love about the comedy in The Interview was the use of running jokes. Rogen and Franco use several select jokes that make re- appearances throughout the movie, getting funnier and funnier along the way. It never got obnoxious and was always delivered expertly. Acting/DialogueJames Franco and Seth Rogen are incredibly underrated. Both of them have massive amounts of talent, and I honestly think they simply enjoy making movies. Regardless of quality or topic, Rogen and Franco are a power couple, and their performances in this film are as good as ever. Also noteworthy is the performance of Randall Park as Kim Jong- un. He is simply hysterical. Every moment he is in the movie from the point he makes his first entrance is captivating. My only complaint about the overall script was the conversations between Franco and Rogen. Whenever these two argue (which happens a lot), the result is usually Franco babbling on about something stupid and Rogen screaming, ""Shut Up!"" While sometimes this is funny, most of the time it is just ridiculous and by the end became a bit repetitive.Seth Rogen does have a great scream though.Action/SFXThe Interview is full of action scenes that are designed to be as ridiculous as possible. There is one scene in which Rogen and a North Korean soldier are fighting, and they keep biting off each other's fingers. The entire film is full of WTF moments like that.As far as special effects go, everything looks just good enough. While I think that most of the props in the movie were practical, all the CGI is fine. Award Time!Best Performance: Randall Park as President KimBest Running Joke: The Lord of the Rings referencesBest WTF Moment: The little kids playing guitars You'll know when you see it.ConclusionAfter all The Interview went through, it deserves to be watched. I give The Interview an 8.5/10. I really enjoyed it. If you want a funny movie to watch with your friends, this is a good one.",The Interview
312,reviewsbycaleb,One to Miss,4,30 June 2015,"Even with the massive attention drawn on a serious scale to this movie due to North Korea's response aside, Rogan and Franco are two big movie stars that can draw buzz for any movie there in due to their proved talent. The two real life friends have teamed up a few times before (This is the End, Pineapple Express) in pretty successful, and crudely funny movies. I had heard mixed things about the Interview and wanted to check it out myself. The Interview, as all Rogan movies, involves crude jokes, language and nudity so extreme discretion should be used before viewing. Nudity is very minor but language and sexual jokes are exceedingly present. The plot has been well talked about and honestly the movie was pretty awful so my desire to write the plot line is very thin and this review will be rather short. Watching the Interview became quite a chore pretty quickly in. I'm actually a moderately big fan of Franco and think Rogan has very considerable talents, which left me disappointed in this poorly told and just sporadically funny movie. The crude jokes and language is about what we are used to with these types of movies so judge whether or not you should see this movie on what you thought about Pineapple Express (with regards to degree of offensive material, not quality of film because Pineapple Express was a far superior film). The real simple problem with The Interview is that the script isn't funny. Rogan and Evan Goldberg, who paired up to make This is the End write and direct this film with the help of Dan Sterling for the screenplay. While the idea was very intriguing and promising, the execution in the writing was frankly terrible. Effective jokes are few and far between and leave Franco in an awkward spot of trying to be funny with nothing to say. The Interview is a clumsily written comedy that commits the tragic sin in Hollywood of wasting good talent and a good idea. Franco tries oh so hard, but in the end this is just a boring interview that leaves its audience counting down the minutes for it to end. If you are looking for a non-kid comedy on Netflix check out The Big Lebowski (if you can deal with the F bomb), Chef (Comedy/Drama), Hot Fuzz or check out Pineapple Express (not on Netflix) if you want to see a far more dynamic Rogan and Franco pairing.Check out all my reviews at: https://reviewsbycaleb.com/",The Interview
313,BlackRoseShelli,Stupid ... and not funny stupid.,4,29 December 2014,"First, let me start off by saying that I had no intention of actually watching this movie any time soon, but the opportunity fell into my lap, and my curiosity got the better of me. Once I made the decision to watch it, I was hoping that I'd like it. I didn't hate it, but ""like"" might be a little too generous.It was a stupid comedy that tried very hard to get laughs, but failed miserably. I didn't laugh once during the entire thing. I snickered a couple of times, and snorted a time or two, but there was no genuine laughter.The first half of it, I was annoyed more than anything. Franco's character was so over-the-top stupid, I was amazed when he said anything remotely intelligent. Rogen's character was at least moderately intelligent and likable.The plot was as ridiculous as they come. Not one minute of it was the least bit believable. Part of what makes something funny is that you can imagine it really happening. There's just no way to imagine any part of this plot actually happening. Unless you count Kim Jong Un being manipulative and duping a visiting American (because that apparently did really happen to Dennis Rodman). In fact, in some ways, this felt more like a parody of Rodman's ties to Kim Jong Un than an original plot.Overall, I felt embarrassed for the entire cast. Mostly for Seth Rogen, but also for James Franco, and even for Eminem.That said, I could see no reason for Kim Jong Un to get his panties in a twist over this. Yes, it was irreverent, but in no way was it anything even remotely worth getting upset over. Maybe he should actually watch it to see how incredibly stupid it was for himself.",The Interview

315,farchettiensis,"Not funny, terrible Franco performance, overrated",2,30 March 2017,"If it didn't have James Franco in it, maybe it'd be slightly funny. Franco's character is a grotesque caricature and makes it impossible to suspend disbelief. Seth is solid, and scenes without Franco are decent, but the movie isn't funny. If you're happy about this movie ridiculing the dictator, congrats, but this doesn't make it a good movie.2/10 - didn't have one genuine laugh and lost all respect for James Franco.",The Interview
316,therocksbarneyreviews,"""The Interview"" tricked me into wasting time writing this review. How do bad films keep doing this to me?!",4,9 February 2015,"Several expected ""The Interview"" to be quite good considering the media frenzy it caused but amidst rumours that it was all a publicity stunt I personally refused to be drawn into it, although I suppose I have been because I have now watched and am reviewing the film because of that frenzy. ""The Interview"" though is even far worse than I expected it to be and for me will be remembered as a very black spot on the films Seth Rogan and James Franco have worked together on. It certainly isn't on the same level as their most recent collaboration that was ""This Is The End"" in my opinion.But ""The Interview"" is quite funny at first, I initially chuckled at the film's several ""Lord of the Rings"" references, but by the end of it I in fact found myself sympathising with North Korea's apparent hacking of Sony Pictures. The film goes from having some decent one liners to childish antics such as Rogan getting his fingers bit off or Kim Jong Un ""sharting"" on National Television. But then if that's your sort of thing, then yes, go for it.To be honest, there's not a lot to say about ""The Interview"" and that is mainly because I'm not going to kick the film while it's already down, because it is a comedy and humour is humour to some and not to others. Bar the frankly unexpected childish antics past the film's half-way mark, the film is just a little less funny than I thought it would be. I've spoken to quite a few people about this film and their reactions to me ranting on about the film have either sparked a similar set of words coming out of their mouths or ones expressing genuine surprise. As I said humour is humour to some and not to others. I suppose the reason why this sticks out to me as different from Rogan and Franco's previous films is because it provides a new situation, this time as spies, for the hapless pair to be in. Maybe my humour is just changing. What can be praised is the inevitable action that sprouts out from this spy movie, scenes like where Kim Jong Un's face is blown off or when we see a small Korean girl firing a sub-machine gun through the wall blasting 10 or so men away. It's this, and the film's marmite comedy, that earn it its stars, if any.",The Interview

Awful from the start to the bitter end.People will go and see it and it is a shame that for such a large audience the film delivers only juvenile humour, bad acting, stupidity at every turn and no intelligent message.

318,StevenCapsuto,Beyond awful. You can't even imagine...,1,26 December 2014,"I feel embarrassed for everyone connected with this flick and anyone who ever knew them. It's *that* bad: awful premise, idiotic script (not coherent even on its own terms as a gross-out fantasy-comedy), the wrong tone (it might have been less off-key if they'd aimed for something closer to the tone of those old ""Bill & Ted"" films), and James Franco doing a weird, ineffective characterization in a role that has to carry the film.I sat through the whole thing, but only because 1) the friends I was hanging out with wanted to see it (given its ""historic"" importance, amid allegations that the North Korean government had hacked Sony Pictures' computer systems in retaliation), and 2) because we were watching it at my apartment and I couldn't politely leave.",The Interview
319,clouseau-4,Entertaining and much better than I had expected,7,27 December 2014,"I admit I mainly went to see this as a protest movie ticket purchase.Don't expect another ""Dr. Strangelove,"" ""Life of Brian,"" or ""Ruthless People"" when you go and see this.This is an R-rated gross out farce of a buddy comedy full of potty and sex humor. It's also unbelievably graphically violent at times.However, I can honestly say I was entertained. Although interviewer Dave Skylark's (James Franco) character was a bit annoying and grating at times, there was genuine chemistry with his producer Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen). There were so much gay sex humor in the beginning of the film that I'm still a bit confused whether Skylark is supposed to be gay or straight.It turns out the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, is a fan of their show and wants to be interviewed by Skylark. The CIA recruits the pair to ""take out"" Kim Jong-un.Most of the movie is so ridiculous that it insults your intelligence, such as a scene where Skylark is allowed to go wondering the streets of Pyongyang without any minders. Both characters play on the dumb American fish out of water stereotype.One highlight was early on in the film with an ""interview"" with Eminem - it was very funny and kudos to Eminem for poking some fun at himself. A scene later in the film where Skylark makes fun of Rapaport being Jewish also got big laughs.I saw this at an art-house theater about 3/4 full in Berkeley, California. The audience was laughing quite a bit.Randall Park was also very good as Kim Jong-un, the young tyrant who just wants to be loved and understood. Until you get on his bad side, of course. In the tradition of the ""Great Dictator,"" what better way to get back at these psychotic mass murdering totalitarians than by making fun of them?",The Interview

I would rather have gone to a theater, but the nearest ones showing it were an hour away.This type of movie isn't one I normally spend money on, but I figured I should do my patriotic duty and see it.Parts had me laughing out loud, while other parts were boring as hell. Seth Rogan played the straight man, and wasn't particularly entertaining. Nor was the guy who played Kim Jong-Un. James Franco's portrayal as host of a TMZ-style gossip show was a little too over-the-top for me, but he was the most entertaining person in the movie.I feel it's safe to predict no Academy Awards for this one, nor the downfall of the North Korean government because of the movie.",The Interview
323,dangent280,Kim Jong Eurghh...,2,2 January 2015,"What is the essence of comedy i hear you ask? In my own view, comedy relies on the importance of timing and delivery in order to effectively produce laughs. British humour is the greatest humour in the world, (No Bias Intended) highlighted by famous British comedy shows/films such as Monty Python, Fawlty Towers and most recently the Thick of It which is easily the funniest and most intelligent comedy show i have seen in the 21st century. My overall feeling after watching The Interview, was that comedy has died. And in a bad way, as well as feeling that there is a clear target audience which, in my view, consists of young males, between the ages of 12 and 15, who will find Rogen/Franco's new film unbelievably funny whereas I, who is reaching their 21st birthday, found it distasteful, crude and a complete waste of time. The rant continues...In terms of plot, Franco plays a non-likable caricature, symbolising the laddish-culture that seeps through a range of films and TV programmes that are ripe in society today, who is tasked with Rogen's ""Samwise"" to Franco's ""Frodo"", character in bringing down the ""most famous man alive,"" Kim-Jong Un, after they are both invited to interview him in North Korea. What follows is a 115 minute orgy of racism, swearing, violence and casual misogyny which most importantly, is not in anyway funny, but instead made me wish i had been bombed during the showing as it would have saved me the pain of following the film all the way until the credits came up. Anyone who is alive will have been aware of the impending bomb threat North Korea have sanctioned in response to the film and so far, i am still alive and well but that may soon change, meaning my last ever review may be on a film that is not only highly racist, but entirely lacks taste and charm, all of which i expect somewhere in a film classified as ""comedy"". The Interview, in a word then, is pants. Of the highest order, and is only prevented from 1/10 by the ONE smile i managed during the course of the film which was brought upon by the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel that featured in the film. Seriously, that was the best bit. A dog. Enjoy. Overall Score: 2/10",The Interview
324,guy-372,"Farcically Hilarious, bit Over-The-Top!",8,6 January 2015,"Do we really have to see the reviews of North Korean Propagandists whose only review is this Movie, because they aren't allowed to see non-dictator sanctioned movies!?! You should disregard all movie reviewers with this movie as their only review! I was not expecting much from this movie. I automatically disregarded all movie reviews which were 1s, 2s or 9s or 10s, knowing that it wouldn't be scheduled for released to theaters if it were not popularly rated above a 5 and wouldn't reach the lofty 9 by a free public, who don't all share the same tastes. I gave it 8 because it was a hilarious farce and over-the-top, but just a bit. The acting, story, sets, dialog and special effects were all within the high quality we expect from Hollywood. This movie hit the goal of being right at the edge of ridiculous without fully making it into that ridiculous realm of ""slapstick"" in which people don't behave as people do behave, and where none of the characters are injured. Yes, it is over-the-top, but I was impressed with the comic, but not farcical or slapstick acting. For what it was supposed to be, it was perfect. I was actually impressed with the acting throughout, and the storyline took plenty of unpredictable turns to keep it fresh and original. I definitely can see why North Korean dictator Kim Jung Il doesn't want the world to see this movie, as it brings attention to his abuses and it does so in a popular fun manner while making fun of him. I don't recommend this to Puritans or kids, but the crowd it was made for should love it.",The Interview
325,DearIMDB,Thank You and Goodnight!,2,1 January 2015,"Apart from a funny little girl singing a song at the beginning of the film about how much she wanted the USA to die horribly, using a variety of expletives - in Korean of course with subtitles - it didn't press any buttons. I must say that full marks goes to whoever pulled off the publicity coup (Rogan I bet) but I found the film one of those ""Buddy"" scripts filled with private gags seeking the approval from a clique of over paid pals in the current brat pack that exists in Hollywood and can be seen in another Rogan pal-fest, This Is The End. It looks like the main ingredient in the writing was ""cocaine"". I know it was supposed to be a high camp fast moving comedy not even loosely based on reality and that's OK but, well I just wish I'd done something else with the time because after 5 minutes it was obvious how it was going to progress and that sort of thing only appealed to me when I was 11. There weren't many laughs in it and it was too implausible to be a drama or something else. Someone took a risk with the script and should have lost their shirt except for the very clever publicity stunt getting it supposedly banned which would immediately make idiots like me want to see it. Well done Barack O'B for ratcheting up the PR machine.",The Interview

327,jacobclark512,"This Movie Isn't Supposed to Be Serious, So Don't Make It Serious",6,31 December 2014,"Sometimes, movies can surprise you. Other times, they don't.Strangely, the latest creation of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, The Interview, does both. On one hand, it definitely had a B-movie feel and was supposed to be campy, overdone, and exaggerated all around. On the other hand, I was surprised at how deftly it delivered blows through its satire.I'll confess that I'm generally not a fan of comedies these days. Most films placed in the genre just seem to be unfunny and stale (I'm looking at you, Adam Sandler). However, The Interview was one of the first films in a long time that I can say was genuinely funny. Granted, there are your lion's share of crude jokes that somewhat repeat throughout the film, but the delivery and timing of James Franco and Seth Rogen is impeccable. From the opening scene, every single viewer can tell that this is going to be a ridiculous movie, and that's exactly what it is. It's exaggerated, improbable, outlandish, and somewhat predictable; but it takes itself seriously, and that's exactly what makes The Interview hilarious. The ending of the film retains this feel as well, but I won't spoil it for you. Just know that it's a little out there and ridiculous.This exaggerated nature carries over to the acting. James Franco is drop-dead hilarious as Dave Skylark, a tabloid news journalist. His character is just plain dumb at times which would usually rub off on me the wrong way; however, he is a perfect foil to Seth Rogen's Aaron Rapoport, the producer of Skylark's show who wants to be taken more seriously by his peers. Their chemistry on-screen is electric, making even the overused jokes funny. Randall Park as Kim Jong-un is good as well, making his character seem pretty likable. Overall, the acting in The Interview is over the top: exactly like it has to be.I also feel like the films delivers its satirical blows at the news media quite well. You might be asking if The Interview pokes fun at the government. Well, it doesn't. Most of the jokes about North Korea are a caricature and not really satire. The United States government as a whole is left high and dry here too. It is Skylark's news program that does the most damage. It invites celebrity guests such as Eminem, Rob Lowe, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt to be interviewed about their personal lives. It pokes fun at how distracted the news media want us to be from real issues and focus on pointless fluff instead. The satire is subtle but easily discovered by those looking for it. I love a good satire, and while The Interview wasn't completely focused on that aspect of itself, it was well-delivered and quite comical. The character of Dave Skylark in general is good at poking fun at the news, as he is just plain dumb sometimes and takes himself very seriously while acting very stupid.However, it isn't all good news for The Interview. The plot and direction cannot mask its biggest flaw: the film's second act. When the CIA show up at Skylark's home to ask them to assassinate Kim Jong- un, the movie takes a turn for the worse. It develops a more serious tone which really takes away from the comedy and satirical aspects of the film. Devolving into a spy comedy was not a smart move, as it just sucked all the life out of this otherwise good plot. This section of the film also tends to drag quite a bit, ruining the fast-paced feel of both the beginning and end. Despite this, there are still some clever moments regarding their mission, particularly when they screw up while in North Korea and at the film's conclusion. In general, the tone remains light enough for The Interview to still be an easily entertaining film.Overall, The Interview is not the most memorable film of the year outside of its controversy. It is entertaining enough, but its midsection drags it down with generic spy-thriller sequences. Also, there could have been some more satire and a more poignant message; however, The Interview is still well worth your time for its many good laughs and just to see what all the fuss is about.",The Interview

While I was uncomfortable with James Franco's character, Dave Skylark, he owned it and made you a believer in the end. Diana Bang, as Sook, gives a supporting actress performance and an action sequence that rivals Al Pacino in Scarface.

This movie is as cheap as those videos; even cheaper.The arrogant Yankees go to North Korea with the order of CIA and that hot chick agent and show them how it's done the American way. They humiliate a nation, play basketball with Kim Jong-un, they play tricks spy tricks on him, they assassinate him with fireworks, stop the nuke until it's 1 second till they launch, they start a revolution and finally bring democracy and save the day again! Also that guy gets the Korean chick at the end because chicks dig the alpha male 'Muricans! North Korean soldiers betray their country immediately because of tongue-in-cheek jokes and American pop music made their leader cry and defecate his pants; now folks, that's the American WAY, DEMOCRACY, F*** YEAH! Anybody whose IQ is higher than their shoe size should be disturbed by this movie and how this movie got so popular with that publicity stunt.'MURRICA F*** YEAH!",The Interview
334,misterphilipj,Better than the neighbors and this is the end. James Francos best movie yet,10,26 December 2014,"From start to finish this film is witty fresh and original. The chemistry between Franco and Rogan was fluid as ever, leading to a light and easily digestible comedy leaving me wanting for more. There are five or six scenes that could make this one an all time classic, which I think could happen with the Adam Sandler flick blended from this year as well as this is the end. But this one is in a whole different league from both of those because it pushes new boundaries and explores new topics which most others have been scared to reach. Many quotable lines come back to mind such as honeydicked and in America we call it Stallone. About 100 others that will more than likely make its way into everyday language and slang. The political slants and angles were not over the top and not in any way in my opinion too unfair or politically incorrect. Both sides of the story were presented with facts to let the viewer decide. A process of self discovery occurred for both the viewer and for Franco which made it an intellectual journey. I Am not a cult follower of Rogan but enjoyed this film highly and hope for its success. Almost as good as team America :)",The Interview
335,muhammedchand5,Not the greatest movie ever but there is some semblance of a message,7,18 November 2015,"So I've actually seen very little of the usual crass and lowbrow movies ( in fact the only ones I've seen are The Dictator and 21 and over as far as I can recall) so I can safely say that that humour neither impresses nor makes me turn my nose up just because I'm so use to seeing it. So yeah there are a ton of moments that are silly and contrived for the purpose of getting a joke across. Neither is it some amazing satire nor does it provide a great political commentary on the situation. In short this movie doesn't really bring much to the table. However it does still have some shining points. Firstly well there's quite a nice take lampooning the ridiculous segments that news channels actually do show as well as the type of news that has become the norm of the day.Additionally I actually and kinda impressed at the tone the director and writer took with Kim. They could have made him a bumbling buffoon like General Aladeen and just played of jokes one after the other of how stupid and childish he is but they actually did a commendable job on giving him a sort of humanity and showing that he's not just ""crazy"" as people always think of but rather giving him some sort of background into why he does what he does. They did a pretty ham fisted job of showing how controlling Kim would be once frustrated (at the dinner scene) but they did a good job of highlighting his ability to win people (admittedly gullible in Skylars case) over. It's actually commenting on the fact that dictators like the Kims have an ability to get people to do what they say much like Hitler. I digress but I found that quite interesting.Admittedly the plan to kill Kim was remarkably stupid and it got called out towards the end resulting in (roll credits) ""The Interview"". A war with North Korea should never actually be to destabilize the government through US or foreign means but through internal resolve and changing the hearts and minds of the people of Korea",The Interview
336,gbraver,wonder if someone is going to come into my house / hack my computer,8,15 March 2015,"Overall rating so far on IMDb is 6.8 as I write this. With 20,000 reviews think this is probably pretty accurate.I've see a lot of totally dumb movies and this one is not much different other than it makes no pretense to be anything other than a comedy. I laughed at many parts of the movie as it truly is funny.Are all the ""worst movie ever"" reviews written by North Koreans. Probably not but then I would image a fair number are.Now I hope IMDb has good security and privacy controls. But then again I am writing this from Mars as don't think the North Koreans have the technology to go to Mars yet.",The Interview
337,zampino-2,A fun ride with some insightful moments,8,8 February 2015,"I watched this movie with a group of adults, friends who are neither pretentious nor critics. We laughed our asses off. The plot is directed towards North Korea but also at the ridiculous industry that supports such interviews, and at our government who actually attempts to pull off ridiculous or terrifying concepts like this. The humor is often adolescent, but also topical and on point. The chemistry between Franco and Rogen is superb, and for the most part the pacing keeps the viewer engaged and amused. A few scenes, like that with the 3 doe-eyed children on guitars, are at the same time hilarious and disgusting, but it works. Ultimately it's a fantasy political satire, so don't look for an informative or sophisticated movie here, just a fun ride with some insightful moments and a lot of good laughs.",The Interview

Only 1 day after its release The Interview is 3rd better movie ever, and has 58,000+ votes?There is always a ratio between the number of votes and the number of reviews and this time something is obviously wrong. A ratio of 58,000:160 is never seen for any movie, so there is evidence here of fake votes.Also it seems that the propaganda machine is running full speed on this movie. Soon a movie about killing Putin? That's how it is working in America? This country is sick and these votes are rigged, simple statistics.The webmaster here needs to check the logs and see how these people could hack the vote system. The credibility of this website is at sake.Some NSA hackers at work?",The Interview
339,mustardman29,About what I expected,6,25 December 2014,"This review is an attempt to judge this movie on it's own merit without any political baggage.If you go in expecting a low brow comedy I think you will enjoy it. Some reviewers here seem to have been caught in the unintended hype and perhaps would not have watched it otherwise. They seem to have gone in expecting some sort of intellectual comedy with deep political undercurrents or something. Other reviewers seemed to be expecting comedy genius.If you go in expecting a typical Rogen low brow comedy with jokes about getting stoned and farting or whatever then you will probably enjoy this. There are some genuinely funny one liners and you don't need to be 15 to find them funny as one poster implied. Like any other Rogen movie it's like watching a comedy routine with a string of one liners that are loosely held together by some sort of basic plot. I found the interaction between the Franco character and the Jong-Un character quite funny. Like a couple of college buddies with their use of American slang. For me that was funny because that was not what I was expecting at all. I thought the Jong-Un character was actually quite good. I'm not a Franco fan but I think he put in a pretty good effort with his character. I'm definitely not a Rogen fan and this movie didn't change any of that. He just played himself like he always does so nobody is going to accuse him of trying to act.So to summarize, if you feel like watching low brow comedy just for a few laughs without having to think then it's worthwhile imho. If you go in expecting something more because of totally unrelated events surrounding this movie then you will almost definitely be disappointed.",The Interview
340,bobbydeekhakeh-98441,One of the Best Comedies of All Time,10,17 July 2019,"This is definitely inside my top 10 comedy films of all time. Not only was it funny, but it was masterfully done with lots of real life events included into the plot.I have no idea how this movie flopped. It's almost a conspiracy. One would have assumed with all the noise this film created, that it inevitably would have at least been watched. But apparently hardly anyone went to see it at all. One of the biggest head scratchers of all time as well.",The Interview
341,gaamst,Franco the original disaster artist?,6,8 December 2019,"The premise is awesome, especially for a comedy(or a Tarantino-movie), but the end result could've been better, or at least a lot funnier. Unfortunately my biggest problem with the movie is James Franco, as he was remarkably horrible in it. If you look closely you can actually see how annoyed Seth Rogen is by the end. Specifically on the boat when he turns away after yet another cringy ad-libbed line by Franco.",The Interview
342,follis12,"Dopey comedy - not the best, not the worst, but definitely the most hyped",6,24 February 2015,"I give this move a charitable six. If you like mindless, crude comedy, you should check it out. You'll find some parts of it very funny. If you're looking for a really good movie that lives up to the hype, look elsewhere - this isn't it.James Franco is awful for the most part, especially when he doesn't have Seth to play off of in a scene. This just isn't in his wheelhouse. Seth does what he does and will make you laugh. Without him, this would have been unwatchable.Overall it is really stupid, but I recommend it if you don't mind shutting off your brain for ninety minutes to enjoy some pure silliness.",The Interview
343,rebeccaspurlock,James Franco knocks it out of the park!!!,9,28 December 2014,"James Franco probably gives one of the best performances of his career and its just fantastic witnessing it in the comfort of my home. This film has some unnecessary controversy around it and it makes me happy I get to watch it whenever I want on my Xbox and IPhone. The first 30 minutes of this film is hilarious and I thought I was watching the best comedy of 2014, but then it slowed down and wasn't so funny with all the C.I.A. stuff and don't worry it picked up a lot and made laugh so hard and it was great. Now this film is uproarious, funny and raunchy also outrageous and it works. Seth Rogen is funny as usual and Randall Park as Kim Jong-Un was hilarious and he did very well. The cameos and the references to pop-culture are smart, funny and witty which makes the film not so controversial about North Korea and people need to chill out. The film was just so funny and I think Sony shouldn't of backed down because people need to see that its not racist or terrorism in any way, but extremely hysterical.",The Interview
344,hjt15,Some very amusing moments,7,2 February 2017,"There were some truly hilarious moments in The Interview and it's always a joy to see cast members who have obvious natural humour and chemistry reunited time and time again (James Franco & Seth Rogen plus you might spot a few other appearances from Freaks And Geeks Alumni). Good to see a major distribution company backing something of a risqué comedy too. And I like the fact that a comedy movie has such a serious backdrop. James Franco could make me laugh without opening his mouth so he alone would get my vote for his facial expressions alone. This movie had a clear plot, an obvious beginning, middle and climatic end so it made for easy watching, great cameo's and might inspire you to have a think about international relations.",The Interview
345,donovan74,Provocative and Trashy,1,6 February 2015,"I took the gamble and went to see 'The Interview'. At first I thought ,just thought I could relax into some light hearted fun but sadly this wasn't the case with this poorly scripted and written movie. The Acting is good with James Franco leading the way as a pushy chat show host and the directing isn't bad. The gags do seem to jingle at first but as the film progresses the message this film pumps out is juvenile garbage by mocking and demeaning other nations on this planet. Sorry but you have lost me here Sony corporation with this one, it stinks of imperialism and judgement over another nation. This kind of production can only create more friction in the world we live in for the sake of a few cheap laughs but I must say Sony's ploy on advertising this movie worked extremely well. I have no other words to describe this film as bias American Zionist trash. 1/10",The Interview

347,pfeiferlj,What a surprise,6,24 December 2014,"A new cult comedy. I initially rented this movie when it was first released because I wanted to send a message supporting free speech. Personally I didn't expect to like the movie. But I was laughing from the first scenes. Both silly and laugh out-loud outrageous. Definitely entertaining. It's original; it's the type of comedy where you watch it and then you go back and watch it again to catch the jokes you missed. The plot basically centers around a tabloid-style talk show host who tries a turn at ""serious"" news by interviewing a North Korean dictator. Toss in a CIA scheme, a coup, two buddies, a sexy rebel, a puppy, and Katy Perry theme song and you're in for a fun ride. What a nice surprise. Thank you James Franco, Seth Rogen, and SONY!",The Interview
348,ozzy_in_uk,The Big Let Down,4,18 June 2015,"The premise of this film had enormous potential; American tabloid TV host is invited to interview Kim Jong Un. As a North Korea watcher and occasional fan of low brow comedies, I was looking forward to this. Overall, it was a big let down.What was lacking here was a decent script, and perhaps a more detailed glimpse of life in the Hermit Kingdom. What we do get is some decent performances, particularly Randall Park as Kim, and very little else. I would like to have seen the two heroes react to seeing a bit of the country, maybe a scene at the DMZ, where Skylark almost triggers off an incident at the border, or a scene at one of their really tacky theme parks, or perhaps a scene at a ridiculously sized monument to the ""Eternal Leader,"" followed by a visit to an equally sized monument of Dennis Rodman. Maybe on the way back from one of these, they make an unscheduled stop so Skylark can can have a wee, and he accidentally catches a glimpse of a labour camp. And I can't believe we didn't see a single traffic lady!So much could have been done in this and it wasn't. The celebrity cameos at the start were good, but could have done with a one or two more; maybe someone like Jim Carey or Bill Murray congratulating Skylark on getting the interview with Kim. Another cameo could have been arranged when our heroes are contemplating whether or not to agree to the mission, and Skylark asks; what would Chuck Norris do? Then Chuck appears on their television and gives them a rev up. Overall, this is nothing more than a DVD movie... once it hits the $1 shelf, because that's really all it's worth. I wished I had written the script, it would have been a much better movie.",The Interview
349,Nobby21,Not hilarious just rather amusing.,4,25 January 2015,"Amusing in as much people got all twisted outta shape about it, least of all the North Korean guy. Sure it made him look bad and sure he retaliated, but that's show business. I'm not much of a political animal I just assume all politicians are a subdued version of Mr Un. The rest of the world don't know this guy much, but we do, know him and where he is, so, better the devil you know? Anyway, there were some very pretty girls, some funny jokes, violence, slow motion deaths, gory deaths, fingers being bitten off, blood everywhere, cuss words, visible erections and a somewhat embarrassed bunch of actors. Good fun, wouldn't recommend it, but whiled away the time while I sat in a dentist chair. A great pain killer.",The Interview
350,agitpapa-562-1441,They hate us cause they ain't us,10,25 December 2014,"Interesting, all those ""hated it"" reviews for a movie that's pushing 10. I have to say I loved it and I'll watch it again. I'll go further: It's both a cult movie, a classic, and a blockbuster.Half the fun I had was watching how Seth pushed all the right cash register buttons throughout the movie, true to the line he has James Franco repeating over and over: ""That's what the people want, give us some sh*t."" The ""people"" in question are of course the young adults that provide the biggest chunk of the US box office, immediately followed by senior citizens. Seth opted to go all-out for the former at the risk of utterly shocking and antagonizing the latter: Profanity, gore, explosions, hot chicks with machine guns, not a single young adult ""ka-ching"" button goes unpushed, but the way Seth does it is pure genius.The movie doesn't have a serious bone in its body but at the same time, for those who want to look, it's a dead-serious treatise on how to exploit the American psyche. Seth exploits the US audience to the hilt with all the Kim-bashing, the anal jokes, etc., but at the same time shows us exactly what he's doing. Franco's character is initially nothing but a sleazy celebrity reality TV host who giddily thrives on exploiting the depravity of both his voyeuristic audience and the exhibitionist celebrities he interviews, while Rogen's character has pangs of conscience about what he's doing, but does it nevertheless.It's a movie that functions on many levels, and like a computer game, the level you reach may vary. The ""hated it"" reviews got stuck on the anal jokes (but are too repressed to admit it) before even finishing level 1. At about level 4 or so you, after you get past all the rip-roaring slapstick, soft sex, and schmaltzy male bonding (between Kim and Dave) you see all the self-referential thoughtful stuff, and it's this self-awareness so prominently displayed as Seth clowns around that I enjoyed the most.",The Interview

Of course I am not a Republican so I don't believe in the power of royalty or presidency, to me they are all wastes-of-skin.The script and the acting is good, I loved the play of Randall Park, he absolutely is as tricky as all those world ""leaders"" are, hypocrites, liars, killers, genocidal egotistical maniacs (ALL of them of EVERY country, my honest opinion).Franco is playing the interviewer and acts really like some casual person meeting a ""leader"" (between parentheses because no one ""leads"" me!) and gets thrown in the spinning wheel of lies and deceptions that these hybrids of human creates to make you believe they are a bit human...surprise, they're NOT!And of course the CIA (Corrupted Individuals Association) is shown like they are: warmongers that feeds on blood. I was surprised that Rogen did not get tortured by the real CIA for showing this since it is their usual ways.I loved the slow motion scene with the helicopter and the missile, I wish we could see the same with every world leader, one by one, it would be glorious!So if you are a society-sucker don't watch this you will be shocked. If you are awaken to the truth of this horrible society you will be pleased by this movie and will love it for the quantity of truth being revealed in it...subtly of course!The ball is now in your camp to try this or not, I recommended it to all my friends and they all loved it but then again they are not Republicans or society-suckers like 70% of the population!

Yeah, sure, he dies at the end, but hey, he asked for it. Thanks to YouTube for making this available when other exhibitors caved in to intimidation. Having now gotten the politics out of the way, I can say that ""The Interview"" is a truly successful comedy that provides you with more than a full share of laughs, some of which are pretty hilarious. Is it a work of comic genius? No, it has a few dead and/or sophomoric patches during it's running time but it more than makes up for it with some really inspired bits. I want to give special credit to Diana Bang, who is as cute as could be as Kim's spokesperson who has a change of heart, and to Randall Park for playing the supreme leader as just a misunderstood boy with daddy issues until he really lets his dark side come out.

Maybe, after all the episodes with the filtration of the movie and the posterior cancellation made me think about putting it off, but finally I did it and it has deserved at all. The film could be totally classified in the gender of satire. The plot is about a well-known interviewer called Skylark and his producer Aaron who have such a success with their TV program. Due to this success, it is known the dictator of North Korea Kim Jon-Un is a big fan of it and he asks to be interviewed by Skylark. When the US government realises that this interview is going to be done, they try to elaborate a plan in order to murder the dictator. However, both of them, Skylark and Aaron, are not precisely the most appropriate for carrying out such plan. It is with no hesitation a hilarious and satiric movie with several unbelievable and absurd points that it will make you laugh a lot. The intention of the creator is completely fulfilled under all the effects. However, this kind of movie is the typical one which has two kinds of separately groups. You will love it or you will hate it. Just, push the play button and discover which band you belong to.",The Interview

This is a unique concept in the comedy genre and these guys did a good job (...almost). The movie has a lot of fun moments, but logic and common sense take a back seat - especially in the final few minutes, where you beg that those two come out of hiding and take things under control.The first half is meant to be fun, and it doesn't disappoint. I feel like they wasted the second half with crap dialogues and a string of unlikely events. Rogen and Franco are pretty good, but you'd wish the writers had trimmed out some of the obnoxious bits of Franco's character.To sum up, it's great for one (and only one) of those Thursday evenings to fuel you up for the weekend.",The Interview

We all know the movie making business is about making money, but ask yourself after it is over would you spend a lot of money to make a film making fun of what most of the world considers to be a ruthless dictator who now has nuclear arms and whose attitude towards the US is not in the least bit friendly? Would you not consider the possible repercussions? The hacking of Sony Pictures is the least that could be expected. But now Sony lets it go on the internet where the whole world can watch it - and now a lot of sites are showing it free.You can watch this picture at face value and enjoy the entertainment - it is funny. But the production, and now free distribution of the movie conveys a very serious message to North Korea - the Western World will not be intimidated by ruthless dictators and totalitarian regimes - Freedom of speech and the Constitution of the United States still stands and no threatening dictatorship will censor or influence it.",The Interview

I expected a chuckle or two but when I was not amazed by the cinematography and blinded by the acting performances of Franco and Rogen(Not to mention Randall Park's brilliant portrayal of the films antagonist Kim Jung-Un) The social commentary in this film puts it on par with films such as Münich, The Pianist, and Schindler's list.

It could have been an entertaining political satire, the possibilities were endless. Additionally the media attention could have made for a legendary movie. Alas, no such luck. Lazy writing turned this film into a waste of a good afternoon. The entire film consists of forced situations, stupidity and shock value humour. Forced situations; When done smoothly situational humour can be very entertaining, but here the writers seem to have been too lazy to set up each situation smoothly. Instead they just force each situation into existence. Full retard; Some stupidity can often be humorous, but never go full retard. Here the main character Dave here cannot recognize a tiger, and describes it as ""a strange big stripy orange dog"". Apparently that's supposed to be funny. Shock value humour; Shock value is seldom entertaining, and it's a hallmark of lazy writing. When Dave isn't ""going full retard"" he is yelling profanities like how his genitals smell like guacamole. Aides from these themes there is nothing humorous in this flick.

So if you liked This is the End, Knocked Up, The Neighbors, you will like it. If you like really funny comedies as done by Adam McKay you will be disappointed. A lot of jokes are typical below the belt style. There are some funny ones and I smiled a few times. But the main attraction of this movie is the marketing stunt they pulled to market it. It went up all the way to the idiots at the White House. So for this reason, I think it is justified to steal this movie as it put in danger the security of most people just to market a Seth Rogen and friends movie.",The Interview

It certainly has a couple of silly Hollywood jokes, but just a couple!Otherwise, it's quite hilarious and dynamic. James Francos and North Korean leaders characters are amazing. Dialogues are great!Humour is neither too primitive, nor too intellectual – it's somewhere perfectly in between. Fortunately, there are not many sex or toilet jokes. You will enjoy this movie if you like Dr Strangelove or Mars Attacks. Or Big Bang Theory!",The Interview
362,pault-webster,What a lemon..!!,1,30 December 2014,"The hype that was generated prior to the eventual release of this ""work"" really was the only thing going for it. A masterful stroke of marketing genius, designed to reduce the astronomical level of losses that this truly terrible movie would have surely incurred had the release gone ahead in the manner that these things usually do.And yes, I know it's meant to be a comedy about a plot to assassinate a dictator, but frankly it lacked both plot, and comedy. The humour was based on nothing more than a series of unintelligent, and very adolescent running gags, frankly way too young for either of the main leads to carry of with any credibility. The use of naive and exaggerated schoolboy racism, was at best, embarrassing but did lean more towards ""just plain stupid"" on most occurrences. The physical comedy, what there was of it, actually brought the level up a little, pretty much to ""reasonable amateur"" status.This movie goes no where, and it does it very quickly. I am sure there will be some who will thoroughly enjoy this movie for what it is, but to be honest, I suspect most of them will at some stage in their lives, be the subject of an internet upload that uses the word ""fail"" in its title, and which involves the hideous consequences of the misuse of fireworks, sharp/blunt objects, and or a combination of those items when added to falling off things that any sensible person wouldn't have climbed on in the first place.

The ~10 minute tiger sequence is better than anything Rogan has done yet, including the entirety of his last movie This Is The End. You can clearly tell this film has been cut up, though: characters have act unnaturally and some scenes play like a series of highlights in an otherwise longer conversation. As a result, the film seems to take on a rather rebellious attitude towards traditional storytelling technique, which you can either interpret as style or lack thereof. I would, however, love to see a longer version, if there is one, because The Interview really could be a great movie. I've seen people refer to The Interview as a screwball comedy, and, surprisingly, that is an adequate description. Maybe that's why people don't like it? I wonder what the public would think of a movie like Twentieth Century these days...

They had great chemistry and brought delight to the movie. The acting in the movie was superb, every actor was great and brought heart to the movie! This is one of the best comedies of 2014. Honestly, the only problem, was that it lost some of it's humor towards the second act of the movie. This movie is supposed to be a fun ride and it succeeds!I am annoyed about the controversy surrounding the movie! The movie makes more fun out of Americans, then it does North Koreans.

It's so puerile, badly acted, poorly written, and utterly lacking in any of the elements that made Team America so funny by comparison.This film is a prime example of American freedom and the American way. The makers of the film should be free to make their film and people be allowed to go and watch it, the film then stands on its own merits or it falls flat in its face.

Full of adult humor, cartoon violence, sexual connotations, drug references, plus some slapstick.James Franco was over-the-top as the childish talk-show host while Seth Rogen played a more straight-faced and grounded character as the director. Both play off each other much like the buddy formula used in 22 Jump Street but they also shine when they are in separate scenes. There were many laugh-out-load moments and an overall good pace and flow to the story.As for the cultural representation, they actually did explore the Korean viewpoint of Americans a little bit to humanize them before going the Hollywood-hero route where the do-good Americans try to save the day scenario occurs.It starts off tame enough but I can definitely see why the North Korean government would not want this to be seen. At least it was funny.",The Interview

I honestly thought it was was going to be the normal stuff he does.  But not like his other stuff, more tastefully done in that regard.Overall, I and my wife thoroughly enjoyed it. A good story, addressing a real issue but done in an almost, but not quite, satyrical manner.I look forward to watching it again, which is saying something.",The Interview
368,guppie2335,Do you ever feel like a plastic bag?,5,22 January 2015,"""If thats a girl tiger, you're going to have to c*nt punt that b*tch"" Seriously this movie is outrageously funny. That is if you like toilet humor and out of control jokes. Seth Rogan continues to push the envelope and James Franco continues to say no to any request that Rogan asks of him. Franco is at his best when he can just be himself, he embraces the stupidity and makes it his own in such a unique way. A lot of people don't like comedy that is non intelligible but I love what these two continue to put out. The Kim Jong Un scenes don't disappoint and anytime the song ""Firework"" is being featured is one of the funniest scenes I've witnessed in a while.",The Interview
369,ferloinvinnie,I'll give an honest review about this movie as an American,7,24 December 2014,"Alright so let's get this out of the way. I'm giving huge props to Sony for releasing this movie after being threatened and hacked. With that being said my new found love for Sony has nothing to do with this review, I'm simply giving my opinion as if none of that ever happened.Rogen and Franco. They're the modern day David Spade and Chris Farley, or at least they're getting there. They're on the same level as Ferrell and Reilly and Hill and Tatum. You get my point, they work well together...like peanut butter and......okay enough with the comparisons.The movie is a satire, that's something you have to realize and accept before you ever even watch it. Do not go into it expecting it to be realistic or within reason. If you have a preconceived idea that the movie will be in the realm of realism then don't even bother. With that being said, the movie was well thought out in the way of being what it is and these two pull it off perfectly. Franco being the dumb one who's idiotically friendly to the wrong people and Rogen being the one with whatever sense of responsibility you could ever picture him having to begin with. The movie and their characters, in that sense, could be compared to their roles in Pineapple Express. If you liked Pineapple Express, you'll like this movie too because it comes with that same sense of humor that just works.There were very few parts that were like ""okay, is this going to pick up?"" and there were parts (more often that not) that were near non-stop hilarious. There are some jokes and comments in there that I've never heard elsewhere that were purely brilliant and hilarious.Sony spent A LOT of money making this movie and you can tell. It doesn't have that cheesy feel to it the way the ""Scary Movie"" series does, it's not that kind of satire or parody. The feel of the movie really was just like Pineapple Express. It's not overly done in a cheesy type of way at all. You really should watch it for yourselves, and not just because you want to give the big ""f-you"" to North Korea and its hackers-watch it because it's classic Rogen-Franco genius comedy.7 out of 10, pushing 8 out of 10. Movies nowadays hardly ever make me laugh and I don't like stupid humor like Napoleon Dynamite or the cheesiness of movies like Scary Movie and I can say that this made me laugh like I haven't in a while.",The Interview
370,teddyackerdude,Franco & Rogan trying their best,6,1 February 2015,"Comedy is a funny thing. Try to be funny and you fail, miserably. Try not to be and most of the time you are golden. The Interview falls half way between trying to hard and being pretty funny.Franco played the part of egotistical, moronic, pretty boy leading man really well in relation to the soft spoken, behind the scenes, brains of the outfit Rogan. There were glimpses of Franco's comedic genius at times but I feel he was trying to hard to make it memorable.Rogan was solid as I felt he was playing the same role he has played since Knocked Up. But again it felt forced.The Interview would forever be remembered for the whole hacking debacle and I think if that didn't happen the movie would not have been such a big deal. It did however bring the movie to my attention as it made me want to watch it. So, probably job well done there.The Interview is not Superbad or Pineapple Express. I will not be watching this movie again for years to come and enjoying different aspects of it every time I watch it. Some of it was funny. Randall Park was superb as Kim but it's not going to change my view of this movie.It seems the bigger the budget gets for Franco and Rogan the less original they get.",The Interview

The action is horribly bad and James Franco can do so much better than this garbage. I fully understand North Korea wanting to spare mankind from having to suffer through this film. So, on behalf of all intelligent people, thank you North Korea for trying to stop this anti-intellectual b-movie garbage. The dialogues in the movie is cringe and mindless shouting. American Hollywood fans tend to like shouting and fart humour in their comedies, but not even american audiences seem to like this film.",The Interview
372,easyspeakkorean,"Wow, this sucked!",1,25 December 2014,"Undoubtedly Sony Pictures made up the entire story about North Korea hacking their data network: it was a ploy to hype up interest for this big flop. $5.99 was way too much to pay for this movie. Most of the footage was not good enough to be shown on the screen. Too often, successful movie makers mistake vulgarity as humor and parody as an original story. James Franco made the same mistake, here. His charm was not enough to stop me from fast-forwarding through the movie. I have to give credit though to Franco and Rogan's marketing genius. A parody about Kim Jung Eun, propaganda-like writing on buses , ""Do not listen to these ignorant Yankees,"" the fake hacking at the Sony Studios followed by the last-minute movie release through private theaters and internet certainly peaked my interest enough to flip $5.99 to find what all this hype was about.",The Interview
373,paxdriver,Avoid at all costs,3,18 May 2015,"I'm not a big fan of stupid comedy to begin with, but the ones that do it well usually have me quoting them for the rest of my life at least a few times a year (think Monty Python, Black's Books, Snatch, 51st State/Formula 51, to name a few). This movie, with the publicity stunt shoved neatly aside, has nothing to offer you when you walk away from it bearing an uncertain half-grin. Chances are the jokes are so unforgettable you won't even be able to remember a good one by the next day; go ahead, find someone that's seen the movie and ask them a good joke. Not a funny part of when someone fell down, or someone had a funny accent, ask someone to tell you an actual joke from the movie. I bet you can't find one... but I digress. The whole thing played out like one of Family Guy's worst episodes. The only difference is, you can forgive Family Guy and just watch a better one next week. Movies don't really work the same, you can just avoid them all together when they are this bad.With that being said, there were definitely moments to make you laugh, but as it being said, I can't remember any of them on this, the day after. If you're trying honey oil for the first time and you diaphragm it vaporized in a single hoot while immediately pressing play and sinking into a lazy-boy recliner then you may enjoy The Interview (II), but being in a state of anything less than total mental obliteration you'll probably do as I did and turn on something else that's just as terrible but one you can stomach watching like Black Swan or any Jim Carey movie since Y2K.

How could anyone but brainwashed Americans fall for this garbage? America always needs enemies and North Korea makes for an easy target because it refuses to bow down to the U.S. empire. It goes its own way like Cuba, Syria, Russia, China, Venezuela, Eritrea and others who are going down a socialist path or else do not intend to allow U.S. and European investors to steal all their natural resources, flood their domestic markets or exploit their people for cheap labor.

Unfortunately, Seth Rogen created none of those qualities into 'The Interview'. The Interview was written as if a 13 year old boy added bad jokes to an English paper due today. Sticking things in peoples rectums, biting off fingers, stereotype comedy and other misplaced nonsense actually lowered the bar for worst movie. Perhaps better comedians could have pulled them off but I doubt it.Randall Park's portrayal of 'The Supreme Leader' was outstanding, as was James Franco's narcissistic idiot talk show host. At least they were professionals who take the craft seriously. Rogen is predicable looking and acting as he does every time you see him, a poorly dressed lump of a guy with no self esteem.The movie falls apart because of poorly placed, distracting attempts at humor. Unrelated and idiotic situations were injected into the plot with no apparent reason. I know slapstick when I see it and this ain't it. Poorly written, directed, edited and acted by Seth Rogen makes me wonder if this will be demise of his career or the stinker he points to someday and says, ""I was drunk and high when we wrote this one weekend in Colorado..."". Just my opinion but it would not surprise me.The movie would have rated as a 'very worst' except for the slow motion climax of the show. It moved it up one notch to just above 'George of Jungle II'. Money well spent for an amazingly well done scene which could have been in any James Bond, Die Hard or Expendables movie. 'The Interview' is real a stinker. Perhaps therein lies the reason Korea did not want the movie released, the smell of it might overwhelm the North Koreans.",The Interview

While the former conspiracy theory seems unlikely the latter point is easily confirmed by spending just South of 2 hours of your time. Sure it's a decent diversion and sure there's a few chuckles here and there but I'd be willing to wager that if you see this in a theater you will not hear anyone over the age of 12 actually laugh. If you're looking for a mild diversion, mehhh, it's OK!

All of those movies are better than The Interview. It's Love Guru bad. There's not one single entertaining moment found in the entire movie. North Korea did Seth Rogen a huge favor by creating the stir around the film. This movie was doomed to fail in the box office and Rogen was going to look very bad. Now Rogen has quite the excuse to save face. Nevertheless, this thing does prove once and for all that Rogen has no business headlining films. He needs to do TV or stick to supporting roles as the fat sidekick to better and funnier actors. Franco doesn't have a comedic bone in his body.

If you're familiar with any of Seth Rogen's other films then you know what to expect. I can't help but feel that some of the awful reviews on here are as a result of the publicity of this film attracting viewers who aren't typically attracted to Rogen's comedy style. Is it low brow? Yes. Is it silly? Yes. Is it funny? Yes. There were some scenes in this film where I just could not stop laughing. There's nothing subtle or clever about the comedy, but it works if you're in to this kind of comedy. Seth Rogen brings his usual style to the film and James Franco and Randall Park are absolutely brilliant, they really made the film what it is. The portrayal of Kim Jong Un is very funny and the character of Dave Skylark as the idiotic, gullible TV host is fantastic; James Franco plays the role to perfection.Overall, a really funny film.

The day before, I watched the final Hobbit movie, and for me The Interview was vastly more entertaining, despite the huge budget disparity. Sure, the premise is silly, and what happens is silly, but it requires the same kind of suspension of disbelief that accompanies watching a zombie or science fiction flick -- or pretty much any action movie. The humour is broad, physical, often sexual, and very politically incorrect. However, although the situations are unlikely, once you accept that such characters can exist, the decisions that they took seemed entirely consistent with the character.

This movie is actually much smarter than it seems; the the main character acts stupid, but in the end was correct about everything.What seems obvious to me is that North Korea, after hiring an army of hackers against Sony has hired an army of ""reviewers"" to bring down the score of this movie. Do not believe all one-star reviews. This movie is worth watching (not the greatest, but much closer to the top than the bottom) to understand how a small character ruling a starving nation cannot take humor, just as some other idiots could not take Charlie Hebdo.This movie epitomizes free speech.

It was supposed to be a parody, or even better, a satire of the North Korean regime. It is none of those. This enterprise is light years away from ""Spies Like Us"" or the Austin Power's series. The quality of this ... movie is so horrendous that the single intelligent thought (killing the stupid dictator wouldn't change the nature of the regime, ... yes but actually it would because...) was relayed in a business as usual way, nothing of comedic value.90% of the joke attempts have nothing to do with North Korea - they are comically impotent references to male attributes, female attributes, the substitute hole, erections, i.e. stuff that people between 11 and 14 years of age can be impressed with because they are in the process of discovering the world of sex and their brains are in an exploratory, one-dimensional mode. Then, of course, there is this special group of people, who despite aging biologically, never leave the 11/14 state of mind. So this movie should definitely have its audience. Of course, few of the lines are fine and even witty, but then the acting is not there - neither Franco nor Rogen reach a level of good performance that we are used to enjoying in American movies. After all, this is not Bollywood.It appears that Seth Rogen, a well-known Hollywood actor, has specialized in exactly that type of dumbing down, garbage films, and he happens to be playing a major role in this movie, acting, directing and participating in the writing process. I have a newsflash for you, CIA, Seth Rogen is a national security threat, it undermines US credibility and stature and illustrates the moral decadence of the US entertainment industry more than the entire North Korean propaganda.The lines about the absurd North Korean regime are phoned in, they are not particularly coherent, the only scene representing the country in a witty, intelligent fashion is the opening one, where North Korean kindergarten girls sing a song suggesting America should die and the women there should be raped by jungle beasts, ... it represents the absurdity, the sheer madness of the regime there better than anything Rogen and co. do for the rest of the movie.If the 24-million North Korean population indeed thought Kim was a god and worshiped him, as Rogen and co. try to convince us, why would they need the terror and the concentration camps and the threat to kill everybody under him. You voluntary follow your god, no need to be terrorized. The people behind this movie haven't even done their homework properly.Rogen and an unconvincing James Franco play two low-brow journalists who are supposed to kill Kim with a slow-acting ricin poison patch and they fail there and everywhere else creatively. ""The Interview"" however works just fine as a slow-acting poison punishing and possibly killing the Sony Pictures enterprise for their infinite stupidity allowing this idiotic script to see light in the first place.",The Interview

390,dylanpatrickbaldwin,One of the Least Merited Controversies of the Century,4,2 December 2015,"The Interview is an incredibly dumb movie. Anyone could guess that by its extremely sensationalistic premise, but it goes extremely far beyond any expectations of stupidity. What happens when you put the usual Seth Rogen and James Franco brand of humor, the bro-iest known to man, into a political setting? Absolute idiocy. From the opening and closing credits scenes as well as the overall feel of it, I get the sense that Seth Rogen (who co-directed and co-wrote the story for the film as well as co-starred) was going for a sort of modern, knowing, and fun propaganda film against North Korea, a-la the superhero comics where they would kill Hitler, but many times it simply doesn't work. While there are a few very funny scenes that I found myself laughing out loud over (most of them involving Kim Jong-Un's actor, Randall Park), the form of semi-improvisational and frat boy-ish humor which Franco and Rogen always employ constantly ruins the intended tone. For it to work all the way through, all characters would have to be caricatures exaggerated to the extreme, however the film doesn't seem to understand this; at least, not entirely. The FBI agents are normal people, which works isolated from the rest of the film as Rogen and Franco bounce their usual idiocy off of them, but as soon as we arrive in North Korea the tone changes dramatically towards the faux- propaganda film for which I assume they were shooting. It all just leads to a half-baked bit of a mess, with unrelated little semi-improvised skits continually placed one after the other, complete with a final act that seems oddly self-serving and unrealistic, even more so than up to this point. Again, this would have worked if the propaganda film tone had been upheld throughout, but due to the strange mish-mash of comedic bits, I'm left feeling unsatisfied; it's like having a conversation with your funny friends about North Korea and they're trying too hard to make you laugh. Sometimes they succeed, sometimes they don't, but they're still your friends. Franco and Rogen make a harmless movie here, but it's dumb, and frankly it doesn't really deserve to be paid for.",The Interview

392,beer_and_veg,Wasted publicity,2,31 December 2014,"I'm struggling to imagine a movie-goer who would actually enjoy this film. I really don't want to insult the future young men of the world by suggesting a twelve-year-old boy would think this film is 'the tits'. No nice way to say it; this film is just rubbish all around. Shame, because who could have asked for better publicity?Let me first start by saying I had reservations about the very basis of the film. I imagined how I would feel if the film were based on my country and president. I would be really disturbed by that, even if it featured a president I don't like. It's just sort of wrong to make a comedy about killing a real present-day president, regardless of the politics involved. I chose to reserve judgment though. Perhaps it was possible to pull it off. Maybe the North Korean government was just being defensive.Well, I have to say, the N Korean government has every right to be upset. So do Americans. I won't spoil it, but toward the end is just an absolutely gratuitous use of violence. It's gory, and COMPLETELY unnecessary. I mean, I thought I was watching a comedy. I don't like seeing that kind of graphic violence in a comedy. It's just highly disturbing. Again, I swapped out the presidents and felt incredibly sad. 'This is just sick,' I thought. Some little fantasy for a very violent person. IF you are not turned off completely by the violence, then perhaps the absolutely sophomoric humour will do it. It just wasn't a very funny film. Not even in parts. I'm not opposed to any kind of humour, it just has to actually be funny. This just felt tired and trying. Additionally, the pacing for the first half was far too slow. I got bored, and I am the type of person who enjoys slow, artsy movies. The acting was tolerable, but Franco's performance was just pitiful. Hammy, over-the-top, and just.... terrible. He was channeling early Jim Carrey and doing a really bad job. Completely unbelievable character, grating and just freaking annoying. Seen ""Your Highness""? His performance was like in that, a total joke. I'm starting to think he's not actually very good, or should at least stay away from comedy.

They actually could have gotten a decent movie if they had relied on creativity and talent.So now after Sony has received so much attention from the hacking and now so many people like me have seen it, who would not otherwise have, I wonder if they are ashamed of the attention now? They should be. It's embarrassing. I'm embarrassed as an American. No, I'm not some prudish person who can't take it. But it was so unnecessary, and yet so typical of Hollywood these days.

I am old enough to remember when movies had good writing, good directing, great character actors, great lighting and great cinematographers. This movie is a nail in the coffin of good movie-making.

This man became a hero the day he decided to stand up against censorship and communism. The date was the 22nd of December, 2014. The decision was screening The Interview against the wishes of the country Kevin's parents fled in the late 30s. When a day earlier this movie house was deemed insignificant, now the entire world was watching. I'll admit that I have had my fair share of luck in the past. Obtaining tickets for this premiere can't be described as a continuation of that luck. It was what the word 'wonder' was invented for.The movie is a magical fairytale ride of friendship, deceit and terrorism. Clear becomes within the first ten minutes why Kim wanted this art out of the running; it is a critical indictment on the state of his person, country and regime. Seth Rogen and James Franco once again prove that they are the modern day Brothers Grimm. It is needless to say the Nobel peace prizes of 2015 and 2016 are in order.A cultural mega storm not witnessed since the Renaissance. This film will cause riots not only in laughter, but perhaps more importantly against the corruption of this world. Ten out of ten.",The Interview

I must have cried at least 17 times throughout the whole movie. Do you remember the movie ""Fried Green Tomatoes""? I thought of that wonderful movie and the sound of those green tomatoes frying in fragrant Lard. How sweet, salty, green, and complete in every way. Everyone was holding hands in the movie theater sharing stories of past movie greats, such as ""Sister Act 2"", ""Naked Gun 33.5"", and ""The Goonies"". There was a point during the movie that I actually soiled my seat. I was so happy with laughter and joy. My Grandmother and her mother both loved the movie. They said it was even better than ""A Street Car Named Desire"". 50 times better! Overall the movie will go down as the movie of this century and the last. Amen for all the wonderful people at Sony, and for my personal hero Seth Rogan!",The Interview
397,aleph999,Cognitive dissonance,1,26 December 2014,"I usually don't watch American comedies – except when I know the director, when I like the actors or when I have a good notion of what I am about to see – because, as a rule, they are schematic, vulgar and ultimately depressing. Even when they manage to have some funny moments, there is always a point when righteousness kicks in and things start to head towards the inevitably constructive ending. A waste of time.This, however, is not the case with The Interview. It is much worse than that. I won't insult teenagers by saying that it is for people under 15; it is simply an idiotic movie, with an idiotic script, played by awful actors, with no redeeming grace whatsoever. This is, simply put, a movie for those peculiar people who think jokes about butt-holes and everything that goes in or out of them are funny. There is no point going into finer details than that.Of course some people will like it. Some may even love it. But what prompted me to write this review is the score of 8.6 from over 66 thousand viewers (when the movie has just been launched!) and the profusion of raving reviews. Aw, come on! Either I am seriously misjudging mankind's average level of stupidity or there is something very fishy here. I can think of a few possibilities: (a) In a masterful move, Sony partnered with North Korea and its dictator and thousands of Korean users were forced to register at IMDb and give good grades to the movie in order to preserve their fingernails. The few ones who could manage some English were also obliged to write ecstatic reviews.(b) IMDb itself sold out to Sony and inserted these fake ratings and reviews.(c) Sony devised a clever way to bypass IMDb's checks and used robots to prop up this disastrous movie.Other than that, I am at a loss here. Some people may have actually liked it, and of course some dozens of people probably have been induced or hired to write positive reviews in order to start it off with a high mark, as it has been usual with most new movies lately (so much so that I have learned not to trust the first 20-30 reviews of any new movie at IMDb). But not in such massive numbers! Whatever happened, it is becoming growingly clear that the interested parties have learned how to load the dice at IMDb and, as a consequence, its rating system has been steadily losing credibility. There are many examples of Web portals that seemed relevant at some stage but then lost their footing and disappeared. It would be a pity if such a large and useful movie database went that way.",The Interview

It is at the same time a cynical comedy about American foreign policy and public sentiment, i.e. mocking the superficial American way of looking at the world while at the same time giving a weird description of Kim's personality and probably even giving an explanation for his stupid behaviour. This all in a very bizare setup with great (and hence sometimes annoying) actors. Guess as North Korean or American I would also not like this movie.Anyway, great dialogues and a good twist at the end. The idea of showing that Kim is not a god may be 100 times more fruitful than the stupid American policy on North Korea.",The Interview

Marketing!,2,10 January 2015,"I mean let's be reasonable; the huge hype created an even bigger suspicion that this movie could never deliver upon.Indeed the gap between what was written about this movie and what it actually delivers is nothing short of huge.The usual acting from the usual guys that won't bother to risk doing something out of what they've been doing for the past movies. It wasn't funny before - and it's not getting any funnier with time. Clichés and jokes that are too basic to even start to be funny, you have to be on the border of brain death to enjoy this.It's definitely a waste of time and money to watch this and the only shocking thing is how these guys still get financing and enough hype to be in this business whilst so many good actors/comedians are never given a chance to shine.",The Interview

Seriously, what was all the fuss about? Clearly, this movie is not worth all the publicity. It's neither funny nor educating, horrible acting on top of that. It was exhausting to watch James Franco's acting because it was hard to understand whether he was trying to be a funny character or simply dolt. I don't think it deserves more than 7 stars on IMDb, because that's usually my threshold for movies actually worth watching. And the idea of making a comedy out of a living leader of a country?

401,lordfanatic,uninteresting Hollywood racist comedy,3,30 December 2014,"Firs of all, let be clear, this is extremely racist movie. This is pure political propaganda, made poorly and cheaply, probably financed by State Department. This is not the firs time. Idea is good, I must say that, but poorly executed. Emir Kusturica buried Die Hard 6,I think, last year at Andric town, but this is much much worse movie. Acting is bad, everything is predictable and obvious, there is no plot, there is no meaning to any part of the movie. Nothing is connected. They are just jumping around. They should speak with Dennis Rodman, he was there. He could probably give them pointers. North Korea is great subject to work on, but they ruined it. They did not mention that there is the largest soccer stadium , did not make any joke about that. They did not mention pointless visiting and flower placing on Kim Jong-il or Kim Il-sung statue. They did not even mention the list of Kim Jong-un titles, which is just by saying it extremely funny. I just say, what if someone made a movie which is talking about a monkey with a finger on nuclear weapon, ready to fire and some ""good"" Arabian celebrity or some man with vodka in his hand and AK-47 in another saves the world.

402,UttaranB,"Often Laugh Out Loud with Slapstick Humor, but That's About It",6,10 February 2015,"""The Interview"" attempts to make a satirical comedy of the political tension and turmoil associated with dictatorship, but ultimately falls short of its mark by focusing more on the comedy than on the satire. That is not to say it does not score as an entertainer. In fact, it has all the elements of a successful slapstick comedy complete with improbable and often ridiculous situations, crackpot over-the-top characters, dramatized dialogs and a simplified story line that does not require much (or any) brain-scratching.James Franco excels in portraying the jovial, hyper-charged but easily manipulated celebrity tabloid show host, Seth Rogen complements equally well as his ever-serious, logical-thinking but quirky producer. Randall Park's presence is largely one-dimensional and he gives a reasonable performance within the limitations imposed by his character. The other cast members do not have enough screen presence to contribute any performance of significance.Overall, the film appears to have all the ingredients to rise above the mire of formula-wrapped humor, but falls right back down by overcooking its script and never having any real entrée to please the senses.Could be recommended for a lazy Sunday afternoon watch at best.",The Interview

The controversy surrounding the movie is much more interesting then the actual movie. The Interview offers middling laughs which is hard to believe that comes from a funny guy like Seth Rogen. Well one thing is for certain that after the success of This Is The End and Neighbors, Rogen and Franco are way over in their head or perhaps everyone is in this awful movie. The Interview's jokes fall flat not because they are stupid but because the stupidity does not rise to the occasion.

407,niqstar,"What you would've expected, if it weren't for the hype",4,26 December 2014,"The Interview opens with a somewhat satirical, but harmless and unfunny, and as a result completely forgettable Hollywood circle jerk. Luckily this turns out to be the worst part of the movie, afterwards you will be bombarded with lowbrow jokes that simply haven't had that much thought put into them, but still might make you chuckle here and there. Franco's character being a complete moron opens up a lot of tried and obvious setups that will have your eyes rolling (if you're the type of person that engages in haughty eye rolling). The chemistry between Franco and Seth is of the usual quality, but suffers from the weak writing. The scenes with Franco and the Supreme Leader remain mostly lackluster and dull, and it is again only to a lesser extent the fault of the actors.Despite the tagging as an action movie, most of the time the spy story remains a backdrop, if you expected something like Get Smart or Austin Powers you will be disappointed. There is some classic Hollywood action at the end, but it won't keep you on the edge of your seat (or even get you there). Similarly the setting remains a plot device, the seriousness of the matter pops up a few times, but is quickly swept away by the dominating comedic tone. There was an opportunity for some serious or semi-serious social commentary, but in the end the movie doesn't want to make you think, if that is for better or for worse is up to you to decide. As it is the end result is a forgettable movie, that would have been quickly forgotten if it weren't for the turbulences around its release.If you like the idea of jokes somewhere between MacFarlane potty humor and Austin Powers, then this should be the right movie for you.",The Interview

Bring out the popcorn, sit back and relax!To put it simply, it is full of butt jokes and jokes worthy of ""Dumb & Dumber"". And for some strange reason there are so many references to Lords of the Ring jokes thrown inside. I guess one of the writer is a big Lords of the rings fan. Also the costume designer who made the suits for James Franco character in the movie looks like he/she came from making the costumes from Zoolander. Michael Kors would be proud of those suits and accessories lol.Look basically this movie is the sh**ts. But it is funny. Jokes are way over the top but it is funny.

Well, it is hilarious indeed. It is a comedy, the script is more stupid than meaningful, but the gags are great and ridiculous. This movie is not really a reason for political outrage, it makes the US look as stupid as North Korea, if not more so. As you already know, the story is about a talk show host, Dave Skylarke, played wonderfully silly by James Franco, who is going to Pyonyang to do an interview with the Dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-un who is a great fan, and this interview is to be aired live. And the CIA wants the Dictator killed in that occasion, but things do not unfold as planned.... I had the greatest fun watching this. I'm going to tell you one of the gags and I don't think this is a spoiler: the Dictator (played superbly by Randall Park) shows Franco his collection of fancy cars, and in the garage is standing a Russian tank as well. He tells his guest: ""This was a gift to my father from Stalin."" Skylarke thinks for a moment and then replies: ""Oh, that is really great, but we pronounce the name Stallone!"" The entire script is that way: ridiculous but sophisticated. It's like having Monty Python back! A big thanks to Seth Rogen as well, great actor and writer.

This film is nearly a twitching dribble of inanity. The korean actors are OK, kind of mesmerising in their own ways, but the rest is not very charismatic or funny.Any college student could write a better plot with more gags to it. the gags are extremely unfunny and sparse. i don't know how it gets pas sony's funding checks. it's college humour for a new generation of students that need fart jokes and joysticks up peoples bottoms, and biting fingers off, to laugh.The sad thing is that if i was a north korean, and saw that this is the face of America, i would lose respect for America. there is a particular brand of B-movie high budget comedies that can be described as esoteric americana plus fart jokes and child humour, that gets put in the cinema it's awful, it has no international appeal at all, not like the good comedies that we know. there are not plot twists. the only thing that was of note was the korean actor's upfront manners and 2 minutes of special effects. and slim shady was very cool. the rest had no mass appeal it was not funny, it was a cultural void. go to see this if you want to un-learn what a good film is.",The Interview
412,mikemx321,Most people won't get to see this movie. That's a good thing.,2,26 December 2014,"I am one of the few fortunate people - or should I say unfortunate? - that witnessed this movie. I say witnessed because one doesn't really 'watch' this movie, that would imply there was something intelligent and worthwhile to see that draws your attention. If you are a 14-19 adolescent male, you may find this movie humorous, but at the same time this movie strongly promotes drug use and loose sex. Any parents that allow their kids to watch this movie would be derelict in their responsibilities as parents.Now, to the review...This movie is rather easy to sum up, because there have been any untold number of movies like it the past decade. Sure, the plot may be about killing a Korean dictator, but with these types of movies, the plot never really even matters. The whole point of this movie is to get cheap laughs with boners, toilet humor, sex jokes, drugs, and slap stick. This is YET ANOTHER movie where grown men depicted as regular American guys parade around acting like the sorriest most stupid a-holes on the face of the planet.It's really no wonder that the rest of the world views Americans so negatively, as our entertainment industries constantly portray Americans as moronical, completely self absorbed, narcissistic, witless, and soulless imbeciles. ""The Interview"" is no different. It's sad too, as I work as an educator and I see a majority of young Americans copying these behaviors on a daily basis. This is ultimately why I think it was for the best this movie wasn't allowed to go to market, and while it may be one small act, at least it will be one less ""cool movie"" that reinforces these behaviors. I can also understand why another nation would be upset, this is a movie that would disgust any average person, in America we are numb to it but I can understand why a group of people wouldn't want themselves included in garden variety American garbage like this.I am sick of all these comedies where the main characters are total and complete morons. Guys being depicted as so stupid, in reality, they wouldn't even be able to function in a society, any society. Another very common theme in these comedies, is using immature jokes you would only ever hear at a kids playground, then toss in adult themes to take the joke to new, disgusting heights. The jokes in all these comedy movies just like ""The Interview,"" if you were to tell them to people you know like friends or coworkers, they would just look at you like you you're a moron. But for some reason in a movie, it's funny? ""The Interview"" is completely predictable, there are no twists, you can see the next lame, stupid joke coming around every corner. It's like every other comedy movie that has been released, with a different setting. I gave it 2 stars because a laughed a little one time, in the very beginning. All together, I would not wish this movie on anybody, it's terrible and more of the same stupid disgusting humor and toilet jokes that's been coming out of Hollywood for years now. If I had to summarize this movie in one sentence I'd say, ""supremely, intellectually insulting.""",The Interview

They're not groundbreaking, they don't change the way I live my life...but I find them consistently amusing. So I expected something similar to his previous films from this movie--plenty of jokes, some cringe material, and a lot of beautiful back-and-forth between Seth and James.And I got exactly what I wanted. It's hilarious, it's actually an interesting plot, and their conversations are just as great as you've come to expect. Sure, it's not the most realistic premise. But it's a comedy movie. Once you just accept that, it's much more fun to watch. Some of the physical gags go a bit too far at times, but then again that's normal for these two. That's the only reason it gets a 9 instead of a 10 from me, I don't like stepping over the line *quite* that much.Great acting and great comedy.

416,FX_Lord,Surprisingly Hilarious,8,27 December 2014,"Having read the many vitriolic reviews on here (and harbouring a sneaking suspicion that many of them originated from North Korea) I felt compelled to write a review, as a British person (not an American or North Korean).I should also point out that I have never seen a Seth Rogan film in my life, and the notion of James Franco doing comedy seemed entirely incongruent (not a very bright spellcheck on here is it?). But when someone hands you a copy of the film for free that has been all over the news for the past week, how could you resist? The story is pretty simple. An overzealous interviewer and his producer, known for drawing some shocking exposes from their interviewees, get the bright idea to interview the dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-un. Once the interview is secured, they are recruited by the CIA to assassinate him.What follows is an hilarious series of events, as they bumble their way through the mission with little success. Meanwhile Kim Jong-un does his best to ingratiate himself to them by showing how 'normal' he is (no doubt a reference to the friendship of Dennis Rodman), thereby creating a rift between the interviewer and his producer.The actual interview culminates in a running battle between tank and helicopter that was both funny and expertly realised.That is basically the plot in a nutshell.But the real find here, as far as I'm concerned, is that James Franco can do comedy. His character stands out for his loudness, arrogance and flamboyance that is performed with the just the right level of madness against Rogan's 'straight man'.North Korean objections to this film can only be because they're afraid that people watching it might think some of the things said or done represent the real Kim Jong-un. To that I would say, 'Only if we are also prepared to accept Eminem is gay or Rob Lowe has lost all his hair.' Perhaps this fear that they have is a cultural one. Have the North Korean government been using TV and film as a propaganda tool for so long that they have raised a nation of people incapable of separating fantasy from reality? In which case, that would be entirely their fault.I'm not a fan of comedies, but even I saw that this film was funny.

The setting of The Interview is rather promising, but the jokes really fall too short of classy, as they stuck overly to the in one's face butt, dick stuff that often found in cheap summer holiday films. There is a positive satire message regarding the trash celeb focus part of the US entertainment pop culture has, but the in-jokes never dip deep enough to the depth on commenting that aspect, always only face value remarks. If the script writers were clever enough, they can easily get jokes along those topics that would easily make the film last the test of time. Sadly, they didn't, instead we get farts and mention of sexual organs in almost every sequence of the flick. Still, for what it managed to pull off, some of the comedy action sequences are OK. Hence make it worth watching just for a selected few sequences of the film. The ending sequence was a bit surreal in logic, hence make the message rather forced and uneven to the point of smelling targeted propaganda. I didn't enjoy the toilet humor, since the laughs are far between... therefore not very funny at times. The flick would fall in a 4-6/10 territory, but like that unacceptably high The Dark Knight, many is giving it top scores and they must be canceled out. Hence 1/10!",The Interview

His early stuff when he started out in ""Freaks and Geeks"" and his break out role in ""40 Year Old Virgin"". But as he grew more famous, I felt like he wasn't trying anymore. His comedic efforts no longer made me laugh and I'd effectively given up on him.""The Interview"" changed that. When I'm watching a movie by myself, it's rare that I'll laugh out loud, but this film had me giggling the whole way through. Yes - the humor is crude, offensive and childish, but it was hilariously daring. Franco, in my opinion, has never been funnier - pulling out classic one liners coupled with outrageous facial expressions. The film takes shots at the media, the cult of celebrity and misinformed cultural perceptions. And while it may not be entirely true to life, I particularly appreciated Randall Park's humanising portrayal of Kim.If you were debating whether to see this film or not, do it.

We thoroughly enjoyed the movie knowing very well that it would be along the lines of This Is The End and Pineapple Express. We weren't disappointed for the type of comedy it was! My mother laughed constantly, but also needed some clarification on some of the gross slang used (stank d@ck had her stumped), and again, we enjoyed it despite a few obvious continuity errors and average graphics. We laughed, we has fun, and my elderly mother has increased her vocabulary. If you are watching this with the expectations that this is a brilliant comedy, then you will set yourself up for disappointment. Go in knowing this is a raunchy, butt joke riddled comedy and you will have fun.",The Interview

And what better present for our Lord and Savior than this artistic masterpiece being released on His birthday. Perhaps that heathen Kim Jong Un will finally be saved thanks to this karmic komedy. Can I get an Amen? After spending LITERALLY all day (leaving my kids upstairs waiting to open their presents.... thankfully made in CHINA and not that abysmal land of the ""Democratic"" People's Republic of Korea) reading the reviews on this site, I do not even need to watch the movie to absorb its genius through cybergenic osmosis.

F*&% Yeah!""",The Interview
426,cvyost,The hype doesn't live up to the movie,2,30 January 2015,"I had to admit I was curious after all the media attention. Note to self: media attention usually doesn't translate into a good movie.I'll keep this short. The movie isn't funny. It has its moments, but they are few. It goes from trying too hard to not trying at all. I wish I could have walked out during a showing - I would at least feel I did something to justify my disappointment because a mouse click certainly wasn't satisfying.Watch the movie, so you can say you watched it and defied (insert hacker group), but don't think you'll be laughing your way through it. Frankly, I'll be surprised if you make through the movie without turning if off.",The Interview

James Franco as the talk show host was excellent (including the dress sense otherwise known as ""fashion risk"") as was Seth as the jealous/ambitious producer.The film is actually good fun right up to the interview itself - but from then on its like a different script writer was brought in and it took a sudden unrecoverable nose dive.",The Interview
428,grimalkin-2,The CIA hopes to turn TV celebrity's interview with Kim-Jong-un into an assassination plot.,6,25 December 2014,"""The Interview"" probably should have been titled, ""Dumb and Dumber's North Korean Adventure."" James Franco plays a successful TV host named Dave Skylark, who specializes in stupid celebrity interviews: ""McConaughey was seen f'ing a goat. We GOTTA get him on the show... AND his goat!"" Seth Rogan plays Aaron Rapaport, who produces Dave's show. When they learn that Kim-Jong-un (played by Randall Park), the dictator of North Korea is a big fan, they arrange to go to North Korea for an interview. The CIA has other plans and hopes to turn the interview into an assassination plot. Complications ensue when Skylark is hoodwinked by the dictator, who wishes to present himself as a misunderstood good guy, and Rapaport becomes emotionally involved with Kim's publicist, a beautiful woman named Sook (Diana Bang), who is not all she seems.Prior to the interview, Kim-Jong-un decides to impress Skylark by showing him his expensive automobile and tank collection. He's particularly proud of one antique tank and boasts, ""This was given to my grandfather by Stalin."" Skylark smugly replies, ""In my country, it's pronounced Stallone."" Yep, that's my favorite line.The Interview is a mildly entertaining comedy, although the last scenes are more in the action-adventure line, when the two men, running for their lives, must escape North Korea. Franco and Rogan have their comedy shtick down pat, but the movie mainly works due to the exceptional performance of Randall Park as the dictator (, who is obviously brighter and better looking than the man he portrays).SONY was silly to cave in to North Korean demands to pull the movie, or perhaps, SONY just wanted to milk it for more free publicity so that everyone will race to see it when it eventually goes into general release.",The Interview
429,ebamovies,The trailer of this movie is much funnier than the whole film,2,28 December 2014,"First of all, I would like to start by saying SHAME ON YOU, to those 23K people who had this movie up with 9.9 rating a week ago. Now I can write my review, it may or may not contain spoilers..depending whether would you rather be prepared for this movie or just be amazed on how bad it was yourself. I was hoping that Sony and the US were in on all of this publicity stunt and this movie was so good that they did all of this to make sure people watch it...and I did. If I have to compare this movie, I can compare it to SBCohen's Dictator, which had it's own share of racist and anti-semitic jokes, but still managed to give me a giggle or even a huge 2 minute laugh during the helicopter scene. The Interview will let you in on a huge secret the Hollywood has been hiding for years right in front of our eyes. James Franco CAN'T act..no seriously, this Oscar nominated pretentious , one smile for every emotion clown and this ""director"" with 0 depth...can not act. Some of you will be fooled that he is over-acting on purpose...like Tom Hanks in Ladykillers, or Heath Ledger in Dark Knight or Will Ferrell in everything..but no ...This is James Franco at his best. Seth Rogen is the guy that started all of this Apatow style comedy from 40YOV..the crazy laugh, the better side of the comedy in this particular case. The first 30 minutes of this movie are just flat, no joke works, nothing can really bring IT. As you indulge yourself into this Anti-NKorean story..you can feel that many of the scenes are improvised, almost as if these 2 best friends from 15 years ago were given a lot of money and they decided to act and joke like they wish and not really care that there will be millions of people watching and paying to see them. It was funny in Pineapple Express, it was still funny thanks to Danny Mcbride in This is the End, but this movie will finally let you see that the ""APATOW bunch"" literally is made of untalented young men that use popularity as talent and make money, if separated they all are out of their depth and can not act for s*it. Only when they are together they hide each others empty delivery and make it up with a better come back on what the other one said. My last 2 cents...First, how in the world James Franco got an Oscar nomination and how Jonah Hill keeps getting nominated I don't understand...Second...either NKorea is right and this is a HUGE US PATRIOTic stunt and this movie is funded by the president...or was this idea submitted and approved during Sony's ""how to save WiiU sales"" week and they said YES to everything. I am not Korean and I still found it a little weird that actual country and that actual county's president's name, likeness and family history were used without even having small ""all events in this film are fiction"" statement...So don't go to the cinema to watch it, don't even watch the whole thing, as my subject says...the trailer of this film is way funnier than the whole thing.",The Interview
430,guitaru-tb,A Pretty Good Movie,7,4 February 2015,"A typical Seth Rogan and James Franco movie with lots of seriously crude humour, bad language and really tasteless jokes but a surprisingly thoughtful plot line and script. I'd heard people say they were disappointed but I think thats mostly from young people who don't quite grasp the political history of North Korea, the United States and commentary about the media manipulation, the CIA manipulation, etc. Rogan and Franco manage to make a smart film while at the same time throw in the usual ridiculous party subplot. I especially liked the celebrity play alongs by Marshall Mathers (EMINEM), Bill Maher, Rob Lowe and Katy Perry (in verse, not person). In the end, everybody gets laid, the world is saved and KJU gets exposed. Cool.",The Interview
431,thade-912-348374,mediocre at best,1,27 December 2014,"This is a very shallow comedy about .... yes, about what?The only thing that makes it remotely interesting is the rare circumstance that the setting it portrays (North Korea's attempts to be what it is not) is the commercial setting of the movie itself. It is about itself, in a way.It has that going for it, and Lizzy Caplan of course. It does not matter what she plays, she is always a joy to watch.Nothing else positive can be said about it. I tried. It is not funny, it is not accurate, it is not well played (except Caplan), the music is uninteresting, the text is missing every opportunity of goodness, very sad that this makes money after all",The Interview
432,darkblue-5,Undeserved publicity,2,8 March 2015,"If one day Seth Rogen and James Franco decide to make a movie together without smoking weed, it'll probably end up as a blank film strip... After all the commotion due to the media coverage on the attempt to avoid displaying this movie in America's theaters, that surprising extra push this movie had, probably made it profit more than it really should. The fact is that after ""Pineapple Express"" and ""This Is The End"", ""The Interview"" completes a stoner's trilogy of films than must probably seem funny if you're high on marijuana, but if you're not are just pitiful, senseless, weak comedies. The movie's idea could have turned out great if the script wasn't so lame and they didn't got lost caricaturing Kim Jong Un in an almost ""cartoonish"" manner. The acting was so bad that is even possible to see Franco and Rogen laughing in some scenes to the jokes they were saying (or to something they were recalling from a past moment, we'll never know...). And this was the real shame to me for I actually have Franco in high regards as an actor, specially after seeing him on ""127 Hours"". As to Rogen, he seems like a nice guy and funny to go on a binge with, but if I ever get caught seeing another one of his movies I must also probably be damn high. As life is short and one cannot see every movie ever made, my advice is: Don't waste time with this one!...",The Interview
433,StevenKind97,Very Funny But Underrated,8,11 January 2015,Overall I did enjoy this film I did get a few good laughs out of it. But what mainly drew me to watching this film was all of the controversy that was surrounding it. This movie is a comedy but it shows us how North Korea is ran by a crazy manipulative man. I did enjoy this film it was very funny and shows us about Kim Jong Un and North Korea. Seth Rogan and James Franco Played excellent roles and so did Diana Bang on her role. And Randall Park did a great job portraying Kim Jong Un in a comedic way. This film is definitely a funny movie but I have seen movies that have given me more laughs than this. Its ashamed that this movie did not get that much time in theaters but it made plenty of money on digital purchases.,The Interview
434,gogogo-13398,Don't,1,11 July 2015,"We have worked hard in the last 8 years to repair international relations. Even if it is just a movie, it has repercussions international. Maybe it will be viewed as a joke but still, it is racist and offensive and it is mocking another country, one that the US does not have good relationships. Any logical person would have realized that making fun of an enemy country, one we previously went to war with and one that has confirmed nuclear weapons would be a bad idea. I don't know how this became a movie and how it could be released to the public at all but again, Hollywood; they're not the brightest folks otherwise they'd be in a different industry...",The Interview
435,joshuapiasky,Ainters goin' to ain't!!,10,19 December 2018,"I like a comedy group that wants to try new ideas. The interview reminds me of awesome movies like Team America or borat. Just on release it caused waves due to the plot, being James Franco and Seth Rohan killing a world leader as tv hosts working for the cia. Don't think too much. Great writing, jokes, idea, just a funny movie.",The Interview
436,bob1701,A disappointing movie,5,29 December 2014,"This was a disappointing movie, the story idea was great and there are a few moments where it is funny but that just makes you see how good this movie could have been and it was a wasted opportunity. The Korean characters I thought were pretty good, they played their roles well and it felt kind of real. It was the two main characters that ruin it, Rogen was just being himself and acting the same way he always does (the way Adam Sandler does I hate to say) and Franco was just being weird for the sake of weird. I have always been a fan of the movie Spies Like Us which I know is generally considered a pretty crappy movie but I loved it and I was hoping this might be the same. But the critics are right this movie is not worth watching unless if you are huge fans of Rogen and Franco's work. It will be a historical irony that such a big deal was made over such a mediocre film.",The Interview
437,franciscoguerreiro_25,Film of the Year,10,28 December 2014,"I'd like to start by saying that everyone reviewing this as JUST a film know nothing about ART. You do not watch this film as just another film, and you do not pretend that everything surrounding it didn't happen. Is this the best film I've ever seen? No. Is it the funniest comedy I've ever seen? Neither. And who cares? To watch this film, after everything that happened, is imperative! It is an act of freedom, and the recognition of an artist's right to produce his work without any political or ideological constraints. And again, if you are rating this just based on its cinematic merits, you need to stop watching tabloid news and listening to Katy Perry. And for that irony alone, this film would deserve all the praise.",The Interview
438,gold_Warlord,Not worth watching,3,26 December 2014,"This movie is not a 9+, a 8+ or a 7+. This movie is not even watchable by todays' standards. This is a comedy that will not make you laugh, and that is all. It is a B movie that had the luck to sparkle controversy. I have watched the whole movie from start to end, and there wasn't a funny or endearing moment that was worth remembering. Most of the jokes are the typical sexual innuendo catch-phrases or typical butt/feces/fart jokes. The approach to the topic of dictatorship is light-hearted and won't leave you thinking about the problem after you have watched the movie. Overall, this movie is definitely not worth watching and you'd better spend your time in something else.",The Interview
439,reazonable,A modern political satire of the highest quality,10,25 December 2014,"After watching this movie I understood why North Korea was so upset about it. This satirical comedy is not a mindless flick by any measure. It exposes the ridiculousness of a totalitarian regime on a very basic level with very basic humor. The Interview mixes the ugly truth about the extravagant lifestyle of a dictator with low jokes and striking irony. This combination may seem absurd from a point of view of a spectator who never lived under authoritarian rule, but it stirs the guts of those who did and still do. Imagine to be watching this movie while living on 375 calories a day, listening to those simple jokes and getting a scary idea that you and your loved ones have suffered their entire lives for this. Can you think of anything more offensive to your beliefs? I do not think one can make a movie more dangerous to the North Korean regime than this one. A drama can be shrugged off as a biased lie, but a satire with spontaneous primitive humor invokes common sense and doubt. While this notion has been around since Shakespeare, there are few classic movies that hit the spot and I think The Interview is one of them. Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen very accurately identified weaknesses of the authoritarian regime and very accurately hit them with jokes that undoubtedly hurt some while amused the others. At some point towards the end of the movie I actually wondered if CIA actually had a hand in this. We in Ukraine had a revolution recently that ousted an authoritarian president Yanukovich. The revolution got overwhelming support once satirical images of Yanukovich's lavish lifestyle came through to the press. I had an opportunity to visit the president's private compound right after it had been seized and made available to the public. The compound had a garage of luxurious vehicles with a military vehicle ""gift"" in the center of it. I don't know whether all dictator's garages have similar layout or maybe it was just a coincidence, but it is certainly a striking one.This movie is a modern political satire of the highest quality, and I give it 10/10 for this. The humor is Seth Rogen's and James Franco's best. Some like their humor, while some do not. But I believe the movie is great when it carries a meaningful message, and judging by the political storm it has caused, it deserves 10/10 on that scale as well.",The Interview
440,magnus780,Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!,6,5 January 2015,"With all the Hype and Controversy on the news over this movie I took it upon myself to go and watch. I enjoyed other movies by the same Producer and the main actors have always entertained in other movies. Having watched Team America: World Police (which at the time also was hyped up and had a lot of controversy with north Korea's leader), it brought back some memories. Overall the movie is entirely satirical and should be laughed at - with the funniest moments for me being the scenes where Katy Perri's song - Firework was being referenced. If your a fan of Seth Rogan or James Franco then I think you will enjoy this movie. There have been numerous propaganda movies since the invention of movies to present, which downplay other nations and its leaders, and even going so far as to be racist, prejudice, and downright Anti Semitic - but its what is approved by that country. Overall I do believe that North Koreans weren't being discriminated against but rather it is a good poke at the government and its leadership.",The Interview
441,thedaver500,Don't Go In With the Wrong Expectations,7,25 December 2014,"Honestly, I wasn't impressed with the trailer and thought this movie was going to be stupid. But this movie is hilarious! I found myself laughing out loud at least every few minutes or so. If you don't like Seth Rogen's brand of humor or raunchy comedies then you won't like this movie. However, if you loved Pineapple Express or This Is The End, then you will probably love this movie too. Most people who hate this movie went in expecting the wrong thing because of all the hype. The Interview hits all of marks you would expect a Seth Rogen comedy to. Crazy action scenes? Check. Ridiculous characters? Check. Funny jokes with an occasional heartfelt serious moment? Check.",The Interview
442,dominic-85-122345,Surprisingly Funny,8,30 December 2014,"So I felt the need to write a review to defend this film against some of those scathing ones it has received! I actually went into it thinking that because of the hype I wouldn't like it but I found it surprisingly funny! The concept of the film is a great one, and for that alone it deserves more than a 1 rating as so many people are giving. I think people want to hate it because it received so much media attention and it is a kind of hipster hate: ""too mainstream for moi!"". But it is actually a very funny idea. The sound track is also brilliant, I have been hooked on Jay Chou's Cowboy on the run (牛仔很忙）since watching the film, and the use of The Scorpions' Wind of Change at the end was brilliant. There were bad points about this film, but other people have obsessed over them so I will let you read that somewhere else. But it is genuinely good political satire from America, even with some sneaky jokes about America thrown in. Basically it is worth a watch, but don't hate it because you anus... Or something... It may not be the funniest thing you have ever seen but it is still witty and if it doesn't make you smile at least once then you would probably be better off watching something with a laugh track so you know when a joke has been made!",The Interview
443,Teeman007,Sub-par comedy not worthy the exposure,4,26 December 2014,"After watching the movie, I'm very surprised of the high rating here on IMDb (8.6 currently). People surely must be trolling giving it 9-10/10?Anyway, I love a good comedy, I even like fairly crude comedies like This Is The End and Pineapple Express which were also starring Rogen & Franco - fun and likable movies. But The Interview is poorly written and performed by Rogen & Franco. It's simply not funny, most jokes falls flat, plot is full of holes (yes, even for a silly comedy) and the criticism of North Korea comes across as hollow propaganda. Franco's overacting is not helping either - simply painful to watch a good actor like him sink so low. I liked the Lord Of The Rings reference but they just *had* to dumb it down in the end to ensure that everyone in the audience got it. *Sigh* Only Randall Park's amusing performance as Kim Jong-Un and Diana Bang saves the movie from total disaster.",The Interview
444,clockwork_orange45,It should be pitied and ignored,1,3 January 2015,"At one point James Franco's character says loudly ""it's really offensive"". It's not. It's dumb and devoid of purpose. To be offensive you need to have something more than two stoners trying and failing to do 'a funny' on film. Everything is done with a cringe worthy wink and nod, and you can almost hear the deluded giggling that must have happened in the writers room as they marvelled over their own limp creation. Seth Rogen plays the same character he has played in every film he's ever been in. Wide eyed sleepy ganja bear.Franco just resembles a rabid child with ADHD looking for a ritalin fix. Tonally it seems to be aiming towards Team America but misses by miles. There is a small film called 'Interview' with Steve Buscemi and Sienna Miller which is so much better. The Human Centipede is better. The only redeeming feature was for about 30seconds they played a bit of a White Stripes song ... that was quite good. No one should take offence at this film, it should be pitied and ignored and hopefully it'll go away. I laughed more when my doctor pushed a flexible telescope up my cock than I did while watching 'The Interview'.",The Interview
445,LukasGeier,Better than I thought,7,27 December 2014,"I watched this movie for two reasons - because of its controversy and medial attention. Honestly I didn't expect that much, I thought this might be another of these throughout bad and silly satires, that we're forced to see all over the year...but now, after I watched it, I can say that it's better than I thought it would be.First of all I have to admit that some of heard dialogues are corky, filled with stylistic devises and also have clever allusions - in short clever and simply interesting. The puns are of course sick and the allusions to the ""Lord of the Rings""-franchise crazy, but under those circumstances that this flick is subject to it's funny.This flick is also playing with the prejudices, we have on North Korea, quite well. If they're right or wrong, we shouldn't decide on the facts, we are seeing in the movie because it's A MOVIE - FICTION. So I also do not understand, why North Korea is annoyed by an political satire. Every person in politics and public has to deal with parodies and satires.So in my subjective opinion 7 out of 10 with a hint that I can understand, why people say it's too childish and silly for them.Excuse me for my not so good English.",The Interview
446,ytbufflo,"A terrible, horrible, no good, very bad movie!",1,10 January 2015,"I am going out on a limb to even give this one star. It was momentarily promising in that James and Seth have a natural on screen chemistry, but it rapidly unraveled into a schizophrenic mish-mash of the worst, most self-indulgent, cartoonish all star cast cameos and a joke free storyline that would make anyone in their right mind blush to even have submitted, much less brought to final script approval stage. If I had to sum it up, it would be like being on bad acid while being chained in solitary confinement as every yelling scene from every Three Stooges movie played for almost two hours before your eyes. (Oh my god the yelling - it never stopped!) This should never have been financed, and it makes me almost believe the rumor that the whole Sony hacking story is just a cynical PR ploy by desperate executives to try and recoup some of their losses ($44M + $50M Marketing) on what they surely must now realize was one of the worst investment mistakes in recent memory. If you want to go just to hate on this, then by all means pay out. But I personally want to bleach my memories of this permanently from my brain, in case these two stars might one day redeem themselves and actually do something I want to see. A terrible, horrible, no good, very bad experience!",The Interview
447,RajaKrishna,"It does kill, but with comedy.",10,25 December 2014,"The Interview is of the most memorable political comedies since 1999's South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, which took a swing at Saddam Hussein. Surprisingly well-written by co-writer and co-director Rogen and his collaborators, the film mounts an impressive, sustained, and often clever assault on the media, celebrity culture, and international politics, taking a bite out of a long list of stars, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Katy Perry, and Rob Lowe.The CIA hatches a plan for Skylark to assassinate Kim. (""What do you mean, you want us to take him out?"" Skylark asks Agent Lacey. ""You mean out to dinner?"") The film takes a decidedly surreal turn when the two men arrive at Kim's compound. Skylark begins to doubt his resolve when he develops a mad man-crush on Kim (Randall Park), who turns out to be a sensitive, Katy Perry-listening, margarita-drinking, basketball-playing hip dude's dude. (I suspect North Korean officials were angered more by the film's characterization of Kim than its assassination plot line.) Franco is sensational, jazzing up his character with every ounce of Danny Kaye energy he can muster, while Park delivers a note-perfect performance as the mad dictator. Diana Bang (Bates Motel) also is memorable as Kim's disturbingly sexy propaganda enforcer.Rogen, who has grown more confident with each film, is a treat to watch. He's so nervous he veritably threatens to implode.There are flashes of true - and truly profane - comedy genius here.I don't want to reveal it though The Interview certainly will not redefine political satire. It's far too broad and far too crude. But one thing is absolutely certain: The film is not a dangerous weapon, or a tool for anti-Korean propaganda. It does kill, but with comedy.",The Interview
448,contact-837-637344,Is This The Beginning?,7,1 February 2015,"The trio that brought us This is the End, Pineapple Express and now The Interview have peeked their heads out of a dazed cloud of cannabis haze to see what's happening in the world at large.In this newest offering, Franco and Rogen blatantly address their concern (along with collaborator Evan Goldberg) that peers in the industry may not be taking them seriously. Though, this is done by their on-screen characters, Dave (Franco) and Aaron (Rogen), and projected as a show that's center to the movie titled: Skylark Tonight.The suspicion that Evan, James and Seth are exploring ways to get a different vibe associated with their work is certainly showing.I get the feeling that throughout the production, direction of expressing the tone of the film became conflicted. This can be seen with some of the dramatic lighting used. One night scene with Seth staring off into the distance was straight out of a Focus Feature film. This could lead viewers to expect a more dramatic tone than that of a comedy, especially given the cast at hand.All stated, The Interview was needed. As far as the hype: sure, warranted. But, only in the sense that anyone not living at 40.1326 latitude and 123.9889 longitude would already know what the fuss was about without seeing the movie.",The Interview
449,coachdent,Horrendous,2,27 December 2014,"Full disclosure...I'm not a huge Seth Rogan fan. However, the bulk of the junk wafting from this carcass of a movie deals with James Franco. Nothing he said or did in the movie made me crack a smile. There really wasn't anything in the movie to crack a smile about. It wasn't funny.Dumb premise for a movie. Real poor writing.You kinda wish there was some kind of substance to the film so that any of the furor surrounding it might be worth fighting for! But it is not. I saw the film online and lasted 55 minutes... I had paint that needed to be watched while it dried that was a bit more interesting.The movie opens with an Entertainment Tonight type of TV show that interviews Eminem. This was the reason for the two stars. A disinterested Eminem is interviewed by the hack reporter (James Franco). Eminem lets slip that he is gay. He does so with no emotion. I think in the production trailer, they must have thought that this would be hilarious. OH!!! No.After thirty minutes of bland, stupid humor. We get to a turning point where Seth Rogan wanders out into a field at night and waits for a drone that flies across the world to deliver a ""package"" to assassinate the supreme leader. Rogan shoves the package up his ass in what must be hilarious if you are twelve.Yeah...""Holy #uck-a-moly!"" (Yeah...hilarious one liner from the film) The first 55 minutes culminates with Kim Jong Un joy riding in a tank through a dank countryside to the tune of ""Firework"" by Katy Perry. Not funny. It seems to be holding our hands to lead us to believe that James Franco is going to fall for the lovable dictator and have reservations about carrying out the assassination. I can barely contain my curiosity! Wait... yeah, I decided to not finish this tripe. If you want to endure the last 54 minutes...it's your hour, not mine. (Full disclosure...I let the movie run in the background while I wrote this and guess what? Yup. Franco falls for the lovable and likable cool dictator! Who would have guessed?)To base a film completely on a reclusive character who mistrusts the United States and looks for any reason whatsoever to justify attacking said country, it is highly inappropriate to attempt to put out a ""satirical"" attack movie that formulates various means of assassinating their leader. ""Hot Shots"" and the brilliant piece of work that was ""Hot Shots: Part Deux"" was actually kind of funny lampooning Saddaam Hussein. But the movie wasn't completely focused on eliminating him, so you could see the satire there. Here...not so much.What is funny is that Seth Rogan's character as a producer of a schlock entertainment TV show with no moral fiber and no interest in hard hitting news. He yearns to be a meaningful journalist and do something to be proud of, which is why he is so geeked to land the scoop interview of the 21st century. It seems to follow the arc that Rogan himself is trying to follow: that he can make a political satire that is thought provoking and revealing about this shadowy figure that the world wants to know more about...Except that we don't. In trying to puff up and fabricate publicity over a movie that completely sucks at every contrived turn, Rogan and the talentless James Franco have given a voice and platform for the real dictator to use an excuse to threaten the US. You certainly have the right to make a $hitty movie. But to stand behind 'Merica and freedom over THIS? Man. What a waste.",The Interview
450,michael_sutherland,The Interview Is A Blast,6,2 January 2015,"As we've seen many times before, James Franco and Seth Rogen work very well off of each other (bromance) as the film's biggest assets. Franco as the main character, is constantly funny with his playful nonsense and Middle-Earth references. Rogen as Franco's honest producer and friend, helps to keep things comically grounded when Franco goes overboard. Randall Park (Neighbors) as the assassination target, is so good that you kind of wish for the whole thing to be a misunderstanding so that he and Franco could just keep on partying. Diana Bang (Sorority Wars) as Rogen's love interest, kicks ass and shows promise in her limited time. Lizzy Caplan (Hot Tub Time Machine) and the rest of the cast get a funny moment or two but, they more or less break up the film's monotony of having limited amounts of characters. The beautiful Canadian wilderness that substituted for North Korea looks great, as well as the set designs and costumes. The song selections for this film hit perfect nearly every time, especially with ""Walk on By"" by Isaac Hayes and ""Winds of Change"" by Scorpions. There's not much physical conflict for the majority of the film but, it all leads to an action-packed finale that would make Sly & Arnie proud.For the full review please visit www.acoupleofaveragejoes.com",The Interview
451,jamestrejo1234,Another hit by Seth Rogan and James Franco,8,27 December 2014,"This is another GREAT movie by Seth Rogan and James Franco. Anybody that watched it and is complaining or giving it bad reviews, do not get that type of humor and probably did not like some of the other movies they put out, in which case they should not have watched it. Its simple, you either get that kind of humor or you don't.. if you don't, stick with your serious movies. This is movie was great and falls right in with ""Superbad"" and ""this is the end"" . So don't criticize the movie if you don't get it, its hilarious. The controversy was a bonus for the movie, but frankly the movie would have done fine without it. I love how they come up with this stuff , and it being current to date with whats going on today in politics makes it that much funnier. I would love to be a fly on the wall when certain people overseas watch it. Anyways, bottom line, if you like Rogan and Franco's other movies you will like it, if you don't, then don't bother watching it.",The Interview
452,appledreams4,One of the biggest disappointments of the year,4,28 December 2014,"At first, I have totally no interest in the movie, until it got a lot of attention because of the Sony hack and North Korean conspiracy stuff, and I decided to give it a try because, who knows, it might be so much better than I've thought. And it was in this mild anticipation i watched the film, and it reveals to be nothing more than a disappointment.I was very looking forward to seeing what the Franco/Rogen combo could concoct and I must admit they are two of the funniest people I've ever seen. Despite Franco's occasional overacting which might not please everyone, the chemistry between James Franco and Seth Rogen is very enjoyable to watch. However, their likability cannot, in any way, cover up the many flaws of the movie.The story of The Interview sure is original, but it's also utterly predictable. There really are no surprises as the movie progresses. I thought the final act would bring some emotional satisfaction to the viewers, but it just proves to be a rushed and under-thought finale. The script is just not clearly thought about.This film is supposed to be a comedy, but it lacks a certain charm that makes it truly fun to watch. Some of its jokes are hilarious but more of them are offensive and insulting. In general, The Interview cannot exceed and surpass other comedies despite its bold theme. The use of unnecessary violence is also not pleasing. Though I must admit that the first half of the film is entertaining, but as the movie goes, it kind of spirals out of control and gradually loses its own purpose. Ultimately The Interview fails to achieve what it wants to achieve and despite the occasional laugh, The Interview is a disappointment.",The Interview
453,kerrychesterpalmbeach,It is kinda funny but I cringe anyway!,6,3 January 2015,"I really wanted to hate The Interview but I must admit, it's got its moments of hilarity. By all accounts, this movie probably should never have been green lit. While Kim Jun Un is the face of evil these days, writing and producing an over the top farce about assassinating a sitting dictator is still a terrible idea however you look at it. Seth Rogan plays the straight man in The Interview and he is, indeed, pretty good at this brand of base humor. James Franco, on the other hand, tends to overact, but then again, his entire life has been one big over-act. Perhaps some other comedic actor would have actually been a better choice than Franco - a smarmy Bill Murray or what about quirky Owen Wilson or Steve Carrell - I'm sure they were all busy and passed - ultimately the wisest choice. My biggest issue with The Interview is how far American movies have slipped in terms of class. Does every comedy have to be vulgar and grotesque? Is it always okay to make fun of people and their beliefs? (Please note I absolutely abhor what Kim and North Korea stand for. I am merely raising a general question about where American humor is taking its audience these days.) Does the word respect mean anything to anybody in Hollywood (obviously not to Pascal or Rudin based on their emails)? On the other hand, why would Kim or the North Koreans ever take this film seriously? They should have just let it go and The Interview would have just been another stupid comedy that didn't quite cut it.",The Interview
454,GroovyChicken,Let the idiotic patriotic propaganda begin,1,25 December 2014,"When you stumble upon news articles such as 'It's Our Patriotic Duty to See The Interview' (search for Stacey Dash slams Sony), you know that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.I watched it, and I wish I didn't. It's dog awful. It's badder than bad. It is without a doubt the worst comedy I have ever stumbled upon. James Franco being funny? Forget it. It's funnier to stab out your eyes with a blunt rusty knife.My take on this whole Sony hack farce: A test audience gave ""The Interview"" a unanimous ""DOA"". Sony panicked, and came up with this idiotic publicity stunt. It's also good propaganda to push cybersecurity legislation through Congress, so Sony got two thumbs up from the White House.The real comedy is that Google is streaming Sony's film. No one else except Microsoft would touch it.",The Interview
455,navylicious,"A Decent Comedy, Misses Real Opportunity to Slam American Journalists",6,26 December 2014,"I rented the Youtube stream of The Interview this morning while having breakfast which is probably the most awesome thing about this whole film, is that it's new and I didn't have to break any laws to watch it a day or two after release in this way. I hope this trend continues outside of the ridiculousness that surrounded this film. At any rate, the film...The premise is known to everyone: Two tabloid show hawkers land an extremely unlikely interview with North Korea's president, are intercepted by the CIA before hand and given a mission to assassinate him. Obviously, from the get go, the story is a farce, so if you go in thinking it's not, you'll be disappointed.Overall, the film centers around the idea of misinformation and lying, who lies to who, why it's okay to lie in some situations and not in others. Sure, there's the entire plot line which is basically just a cheap pantsing of Kim Jong-Un (not that it's undeserved mind you), but really, despite bland characterization overall (Rogan and Franco are only believable because they're friends off camera too, it's characters dealing with how to respond to lies, spot lies, what to do about it later, etc, if we were to remove all political aspects of the movie. There are a lot of very funny scenes involving this ongoing theme, such as Franco's character's realization he's been lied to by Un, Un realizing Franco's lied to him, etc. All over the place are these really funny moments about revelations the characters have about each other, though it does get a little tiresome by the end after everyone's apparently been betrayed at least once in some way. Some of the action was directed quite poorly, which is expected with this being a comedy. For instance, just simple things like shot continuity involving a tank and a helicopter. Tank is shooting backwards at helicopter (retreating from it, with barrel pointed backwards) and in movie-time, milliseconds later, it's facing forward for the 'cool tanks don't look at explosions' shot. Little things here and there would pull me out of the film, but they're really only noticeable when the film takes a turn into action territory the last 10 minutes. And I must say, the despite it being completely unnecessary and feeling a little out of place, Un's ultimate destiny in the film is quite a beautiful shot. One of the real disappointments with a movie that starts from a political place is not taking it to it's logical conclusion. The plot points all revolve around the fact that North Korea's propaganda machine is impenetrable and the country's people believe the most ridiculous things due to a stranglehold on information, but there was no mention of how we have similar issues in the United States with misinformation due to money and corruption in our own country. These things didn't even have to be clearly defined since our characters ARE NOT journalist, they're tabloid peeps. However, Franco's final line (paraphrased) that he started a revolution with a camera and a few questions should've been expanded on to slam American journalists for not asking question...though I think Rogan might have been better as Franco is the 'retard who is out of place' in the film, in terms of his behavior. Ultimately, it's just a silly comedy with nothing real to say, though it does, randomly, through real facts at the audience, but they're from the mouth of the 'enemy' in the movie who is at that point called a liar, so the message gets lost to audiences unaware of realities spoken of. If you can understand that it has no position on anything other than leaders shouldn't be dicks to their countries, then you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, look for your pointed satire and political criticism elsewhere and pretend this movie is about an unnamed country with a fantasy leader and it'll probably be more enjoyable.",The Interview

457,blazaj,By far the worst movie I've ever seen,1,10 January 2015,"Why would one walk on shaky ground to bring out such mediocrity? North Korea shouldn't even dignify this movie with a reaction. It's really not worth it. The supposed to be funny moments were so bad, that the worst comedy I had seen previous to this suddenly became decent. And since comedy ratings are pretty low, I completely fail to understand how this got over 7. My guess is because of the audacity to approach this subject. But even more I would expect the disappointment of the result to be more obvious. This movie felt like the US was trying to pick on North Korea with ""yo mama"" jokes and the result was just so very stupid.",The Interview

The sarcasm was wonderful, the plot was so so... and the acting was OK too, and the production values were all OK. Where it may have lacked for some would be in the tasteless category, hyperbole etc.It may not be in the taste category for some.... but if you like SNL, Colbert and Daily Show you might just like it!

I had to give input and write down things about the movie I liked and didn't like and if anything was too offensive, then I handed my report back to some Sony execs after the movie. It may be just another dumb comedy, but its a classic Rogan/Franco masterpiece. I'm dying to see it again. I'm sure the version I saw was so so unfinished that the final product will be even better, which I don't know how is possible because I couldn't of asked for a better version. As soon as this movie becomes available, I'm going to jump at the chance to see it again. I wanted to give this 10 stars back in October. And right before I wrote this review I saw 20,000 people had already given it 10 stars. I highly doubt even half of those actually saw it like I did. But I am happy it garnered so much controversy and awareness, and it definitely deserves those 10 stars hands down.

This movie caused a cyberattack I even watched the documentary. this movie it was an insult to North Korea even if they do what is wrong. As for Seth Rogen he tries to hard, his role in this movie was not surprising at all. This movie was a prime example of why we shouldn't insult nations. This movie was all over the news and was a blacklist of reasons to start a cyberattack. Please Seth Rogen check your ego your Director and choice in this movie costed our privacy. I didn't agree with one situation in this movie they could of at least not insulted a nation. Not all comedy movies are funny and this isn't the last one.",The Interview

Not only that but the acting was terrible too and the music was always way louder than the talking scenes. It was so annoying! Why do I have to use 10 lines to fill up this review?? IMDb that policy is dumb and you should really change it because I can't even find the right words to describe how bad this movie is.

Seth Rogan and James Franco are wasted on this film.I was cringing all the way through it. The jokes are totally infantile and I can't remember laughing at any of them.This movie is best avoided.

463,IllyaBenkard,A FUBAR movie to receive cult status because of a near missed diplomatic incident,4,26 December 2014,"I wasn't expecting much when I got my hands on this movie and I was right about it. There's nothing special about this movie. The hype created around it with the so called hack attack over Sony employees has just happened to make sure that this movie would be watched all around. Still, there's no movie that don't deserve some time to be watched and I decided to give it a try.It's an awful combination of every kind of cliché in US comedy, combined with cheap boobs-to-the-face moments and stinking lashed out lines and jokes that seemed to be taken out from a Borat tier movie. Yet, I could laugh at some moments. Some lines and scenes are actually funny.The plot is a convenient story is about a disregarded reporter David Skylark (James Franco) that gets the chance of a lifetime to interview the most recluse, and hated, dictator of the modern world, Kim Jong- Un (Randall Park), right when there's a moment of tension where the dictator threatens the world, say United States, with a newly developed set of nuclear ICBMs. Foreseeing the threat, the CIA and it's spooks realize that this is a great chance to eliminate the dictator, disregarding the history proved fact that killed leaders tend to make assure his lineage of power, and send Skylark together with his assistant Aaron Rapaport (Seth Rogen).I won't spoil the movie any more, but I sincerely recommend you to avoid the hype and don't hit the cinemas with any expectations. The movie is not to be taken seriously and the comedy is mostly poorly constructed, yet the directors made their research about DPRK's culture and landmarks.I personally praise the photography, which is one of the few points that the movie stands out and you actually believe that you're in Eastern Asia. Stunning visuals and landscapes help in the immersion of the plot.Again, this movie is not to be taken seriously. It's typical US comedy that may even sound disrespectful and cringe worthy in some moments, yet it has it's fine moments. But in the overall, the movie is an atrocity and you should watch this movie only if you haven't anything else to do in a boring evening. Still, there are so many better movies to watch. Forget about the hype. It's not worth it.",The Interview
464,avatar_108,More than propaganda,2,25 December 2014,"There was a lot hype leading up to this movie given the Sony breaches and the diplomatic row between the United States and North Korea that has resulted. After watching it, it is not hard to see why; this is an out and out American propaganda film.To say however that I did not totally enjoy it would be untrue. At times Rogen and Franco's natural on screen chemistry shines through, and some of the jokes are exceedingly well delivered. That said, there are plenty of sex and fart jokes. The use of incontinence as gag wears pretty thin after a while though.The production values at times are really slick; there are some great shots of countryside, the camera work is solid and the movie manages to take only a couple of sets and make it feel like it much more 'open' than it really is.The issues start when we are introduced to Kim. It is painfully obvious that this is an American propaganda film. Kim manages to charm Skylark almost instantly showing a predictably human side that before too long is revealed to all be an act. The attempts at showing us what makes North Korea so bad is tired repetitions of the worst of what we know about the DPRK. This isn't unexpected – nobody would argue that North Korea is a highly enlightened progressive nation. But just as the character in the movie wants to show us the 'true picture' of North Korea – the film feels like what it is really showing us what the United States government wants us to see.There seem like there were a number of opportunities to grant the movie a little depth; at one point KJU tries to talk about U.S incarceration statistics. The camera turns away to a graphic fight scene in the control even before that sentence is finished. It's actually a particularly telling moment. Who are the U.S to accuse North Korea of running concentration camps when one in three African Americans have been or are likely to go to prison. The irony of talking about how the DPRK is a violent regime whilst showing us tonnes of violence & gore is either completely lost on the director; or what I felt more likely, edited out from the script before release.It feels like at times that The Interview is trying to be more even handed or perhaps contrast the United States and North Korea more equivocally & that it's been shut down in post production by the producers. At times characters seem to have moral dilemmas about killing a head of state and how this hasn't worked out in the past. These concerns are hand waved away with stunning regularity and often even the shots where this dialog takes place is cut short or gun fights are interspersed. The irony of a film released of dubious subject matter to cries of 'free speech' engaging in blatant self-censorship doesn't seem to be lost on the writers; it's often only obliquely commented on.The film feels like a character assassination piece. It's strange that the movie almost is what is trying to be about – showing the world that Kim isn't a ""God"" but who in the target audience doesn't already know that? It certainly seems aimed at creating a perception and image issue for the man. I can't blame him for being irate.These aren't the only issues with the script. The film regularly bends of backwards to be politically correct, especially in regards to women, negative and ignorant stereotypes of Asians abound. There are terrible accents, terrible impersonations of Asian speakers abound and the amount of English spoken by North Koreans is kind of astounding. It carries on this 'celebration' of African American culture that often feels more exploitative than anything. It often portrays North Koreans in a very one dimensional way; they are either eager to betray their country for the benefits of American style capitalism or violent megalomaniacs who secretly desire the fruits of American culture. If the film is not apologizing for the United States, it's celebrating it. Deep down, everybody we see wants to be good Americans, instead of 'good North Koreans' and those who don't are one dimensionally evil.This film is insidious in a lot of ways. It panders directly to an Americo-centric world-view. It's portrayal of men borders on sexist, all the male characters are seeking approval from father figures who didn't care for them or are easily manipulated by their biological imperatives. The women are confident Mary-Sues who whilst engaging in deceptive conduct, are in it for the 'greater good'. It's propaganda and apologist at the same time; that's no reason not to watch it but you should be aware that it is what it is. The thing that scares me about this movie is that it does seem like Rogen was really trying to pull away from that and for whatever reason, was overruled. I might be wrong on that count; but the attempts of the film to pull back from the precipice of nationalistic propaganda fail, and it goes right over the cliff.",The Interview

If Kim Jung Un hadn't sent his hackers after this movie, then honestly it would have gotten a lot less attention and would have merely been a footnote in 2014 comedy films. The humor is very cheap and flat. The acting isn't good. There is not a single time during the movie when I actually laughed. You know a comedy film is trash if your facial expression while watching the movie is similar to a student watching an academic video. The movie is also lacking a good storyline. It's very predictable and unimpressive. If you want to see this movie at a theater to make a statement about free speech, then fine.

Just exaggerated typical predictable jokes. James and Seth can be funny actors usually and act really well- but their character is somewhat confusing here. Seth is the typical fat ugly guy he always plays- so shame to not be able to see him as a journalist!This film was probably produced to rake in 'free' money- and to also fill our minds in with how horrible North Korea is and how foolish their policy and methods are. They have their culture and their goals- if they affect peace among the rest of us then yes we can interfere but all I see is the west filling our minds to say that its OK to invade North Korea.

At the other hand, Seth Rogen had a extraordinary thinking and strategy when it is in a different situation. With the concept that there is always outside the mind of the actors.

Most jokes are obscene and dirty without any limits, and at the same time they are not funny at all, but rather annoying. But the movie had a story, it was interesting and entertaining at the same time. Although the story itself is way beyond stupidity and reality, it is better to have than story that to not have a story at all like most movies nowadays. This movie kinda stayed in my memory which is very very rare lately with all zero interest movies coming out lately. I enjoyed the end R action scene, and I appreciate the director decided to show off some nice gore and blood. Not a lot though. Hard to say anything about acting.

I turned my nose up a little at the college bromance humor and scoffed a bit. Then after chuckling a few times by reflex, and then a few more times, and then laughing out loud uncontrollably; I said to myself, ""Self, this is one damn funny movie."" Then the character play, and the plot control, and the special effects all came together, and I said to myself, ""Self, why do you address yourself in the third person?"" No, really what I said is that this is a damn good movie. It has some gratuitous violence that seems out of place, but then it all fits together in the end.

The Lord Of The Rings Jokes are pretty much the only positive thing about it and it is really hard to not just quit watching.

The problem I have with this movie is that it's now going to be hugely popular because of all the publicity that surrounds it, and it's not even good! I think I laughed properly once and snickered maybe four times. It's stupid and childish. And the characters, Kim Jong Un was the only likable guy. The whole time I wanted to punch James Franco in the face. I honestly don't see why North Korea was so concerned about the release of this movie, because it'd give Americans assassination ideas? If that's the case they have absolutely no reason to worry. I watched it with 5 other people. Of the six of us two people enjoyed it. The two who enjoyed it were teenage boys.

The film obviously concentrates on the pairs attempts to interviews North Korea's leader and enter the usually closed off country. This results in repeatedly cringing scenes with stupid jokes, childish behavior and repeated gay references. How James Franco can sit there and spew out the garbage seen is a wonder.

It may not be everyone's cuppa tea (if you're looking for sophistication, try Woody Allen) but wouldn't expect anything less-than-great from Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen. Movie goers in the States will enjoy this and will laugh out loads. James Franco steals the show as Dave Skylark and props to Randall Park as Kim Jong Un, who somehow manages to humanise the Dictator.

475,Rabsi,A poor comedy dressed as a flat satire. The Interview should have been released. But should it have been made?,3,8 January 2015,"In October 2014, comedy motoring show Top Gear attracted criticism and then violence in Argentina for driving around sporting a number plate that made references to the Falklands War. Veterans saw this as a needless joke and an attack on what they considered a touchy subject. They alleged that Top Gear had easily crossed the line with their provocations, and that the attack (involving rocks and other projectiles thrown at the cars of the presenters and the crew) was inevitable. Top Gear insisted the plate was completely coincidental. So it rumbles on.Which brings us to The Interview, an entirely different level of provocation. It makes the Top Gear incident seem insignificant in comparison. How far can you openly lambast a living political leader and keep it funny?The Interview is a film composing of two very distinct parts: the buddy comedy of two very good friends, and the political satire of North Korea. That these two can be so readily separated is already an issue, and an omen of things to come. For all the hype, The Interview is actually a very disappointing film, both from a comedic and a satirical view.Comedically, the film is a letdown even by Seth Rogen's and James Franco's standards. They of course do have their formula and style which already would not impress a certain crowd. The now proverbial ""dick and fart humour"" is pervasive here, but everything is put together like a puzzle with no more than 4 pieces. Furthermore, there was an obsession with shoe-horning as many contemporary terms into the film as possible, probably in order to connect with the audience. It just comes across as the unpopular nerd spewing catchphrases he read on the internet in an attempt to fit in.Like Kim Jong Un, the audience does not get treated with much respect either. Figuring out jokes yourself is not only more satisfying, but it helps the film flow just as much. The Interview is a juddering affair, using so much time to repeat or explain every joke, for fear that we might miss the fact that a tiger has night vision (but not night vision goggles). Rogen and Franco have been funnier before (see Pineapple Express) so this isn't a case of a film being dead on arrival for a certain section of the audience. They have their juvenile style, but it has worked better before.To briefly address the satire aspect, it truly comes down to one's opinion after seeing the events. In my opinion the satire took it too far, it was not humorous anymore because shock value was preferred over actual incisive mockery. The poor human rights records and death camps are certainly addressed, but they had much more fun looking at the cult of personality surrounding Kim Jong Un (and all his ancestors). At that point it became more of a personal attack on Kim Jong Un rather than North Korea itself. Place any world leader into Kim Jong Un's position and subject him to the insults seen in the film, and it would be plain offensive. But since North Korea is such low hanging fruit, people can get away with making films like this.Are there any positives? The physical portrayal of Kim Jong Un was actually quite funny, and the best and funniest scenes of the film are the scenes involving Randall Park (Kim) and James Franco. The film is also an important one for the film industry in more ways than one: as bad and boring as the film is, it was important to release it. It might have been the beginning of a slippery slope otherwise. Secondly, the film was released simultaneously in theatres and online, which was a landmark moment and it will be fascinating to see the film industry's response.Read more at rabsi1.weebly.com/film/",The Interview
476,Orion80202,A classic for very different reasons,10,24 December 2014,"Some movies are classics because they are just flat out good. Think of The Godfather or Raging Bull. Others are classics because they broke new ground, for example The Wizard of Oz and Star Wars. But some, like The Interview, are bound to be classics because of things that have nothing to do with the movie itself. But all the geopolitical nonsense aside, The Interview is a pretty funny movie. Had the man with the tiniest penis in the world not threatened to destroy America over this movie, it would likely have faded away from theaters after a few weeks, leaving only a few catch phrases for teenage boys in its wake. But now it is so much bigger than itself. Everyone should see this movie just to remind themselves that even silly satire is worthy of uncensored screening. Eminem also has a funny cameo that, alone, is worth the price of admission or VOD.",The Interview

So thank you Sony for creating difficult international relations and wasting millions of viewing hours on trash like this. The scripts coming out of Hollywood are getting paper thin, this was ""rice paper thin"" absolutely dreadful, but again, you have to see it don't you",The Interview
479,mkittappa-239-319441,"If only Kim Jong Un had just ignored it, then it would have just gone away.",4,15 February 2015,"Oh Kim Jong Un, you really shot yourself in the foot with the fuss you made over this movie didn't you? Had you ignored it then it would have just gone away, consigned to the bargain DVD bin in a few short weeks. Now, because of all your foot stamping, so many more people; folks that wouldn't have given this a second glance are watching all in the name of free speech. Kim, please understand this movie really wasn't worth getting your panties in a knot over.The Interview is a mediocre stoner comedy at best which is unfortunate because the first twenty minutes or so showed much promise, from the cute North Korean kid singing death to America, to celebrities like Eminem and Rob Lowe sending themselves up in hilarious fashion. The movie is such a missed opportunity that could have been a fantastic satire on so many levels mocking the North Korean Regime, American tabloid media, the CIA and US international relations. Team America achieved this so well whereas the Interview descended very quickly into toilet humor, and obvious slapstick comedy rehashing the same jokes over and over again. The boner in your underpants maybe funny the first time, but gets tired very quickly. Don't get me wrong, there are some genuinely funny moments, but there are just not enough of them to sustain the length of film.As the interview gets towards its finale, it then tries way too hard packing in so much cartoon action but it's so ridiculous an unsubtle. It's like a clown hitting you over the head with rubber chicken multiple times 'saying look at me I'm funny... I'm funny'One redeeming aspect was Randall Park's performance as Kim Jong Un. He certainly nailed the conflicted dictator. He had some great comic timing and most of the movie's best laughs came from Park's performance. Seth Rogen had some great moments also, but James Franco on the other hand hammed it up way too much. What's with all those weird facial expressions? I do wish that the script allowed more depth to Diana Bang's character, but she did a good job with what she had to work with.All in all though the interview was certainly not worth all the hype and attention that it received. If you like slapstick stoner humor then this is one to watch, but even in that genre there are many other way better films out there than this. If you are looking for meaningful satire and intelligent comedy then this is not the movie for you. And if you are the dictator of a totalitarian regime then fear not, there is nothing here that will threaten your power base. Safer to just leave it alone.",The Interview
480,pokeyallred,not good enough to go to war over,4,26 June 2015,"The Interview is exactly what you expect it to be when you see the preview for the first time. Many people may go and see it , expecting for it to be some in depth film about the politics of North Korea from a different point of view, and that really is not what happens here at all. This movie more focuses on the friendship formed between the news reporter Dave Skylark, and the dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, bonding over a Katy Perry track. People who come to see this movie should not complain over all of the strong language and crude humor, it seems to be those sorts of things that people actually go to James Franco/Seth Rogan movies to see.One of the aspects of this movie that is interesting is the things that the people of North Korea believe about their supreme leader. In real life they see him as a god, and this film actually does play off of that, making light of everything that is bad with the Kim family regime, from the labor camps, to the starving children on the streets. It is true that some of the things that they say about the generals being on the fence on the things that the leader is doing, and that some of them are actually just doing it out of fear for what might happen to their families.The film ends with the fearless leader bursting into flames in slow motion in an exploding helicopter, something that did not really make the real Kim very happy. They were even threatening to nuke our country if we released the movie. obviously we released the movie, and we are still here. Even though the movie may have been entertaining at a few parts, it is nowhere near good enough for us to go into a nuclear war over.",The Interview

The only reason I gave it three stars was all the hype about North Korea that I'm still not totally convinced wasn't created by Sony in the first place. The movie starts, and within moments Rogen starts his usual, predictable pedantic slew of curses. Maybe I should have given it more time? If the meal is bad after the first bite, do you continue to keep eating it? No. As foe Franco, He has talent. I enjoyed his portrayal as The Wizard in his Oz remake. And In his Spiderman movie. Now where does this movie go? as a blockbuster? I doubt it.

How improbable is it that the whole evil hacking plot meme was engineered just to push this Xmas turkey? According to The Hill 'Sony Pictures initially pulled 'The Interview' from its scheduled Christmas Day release after hackers threatened to stage September 11- style attacks at theaters that showed it. Major movie theater chains then said they would not carry the film, which North Korea had declared an act of war given its plot.' - Then suddenly - 'Sony reversed itself this week, announcing it would not only screen the movie in select theaters, but that it had worked out deals with several companies to show the movie online and on-demand.' - Totally unbelievable. It's a pity that all the imagination & talent involved in allegedly killing 'The Interview' wasn't involved in writing, directing, or acting in it.

Still, if you've enjoyed past Seth Rogen comedies then you'll enjoy this movie. If you weren't a fan of his movies before then this will definitely NOT be the one to win you over.Maybe one day in the far off future when the controversy surrounding this films dies down, Sony might see fit to release a version with the missing scenes included if those scenes exist at all.

It's a shame SONY pulled the skylark tonight website. There were a pile of great faux interviews. The one with Zack Efron is on youtube and should not be missed. The star interviews used in the movie are stellar. Lots of star cameos ala The End, (another laugh a minute movie, IF you enjoy Seth and Evan's humor). I rented the movie thru Xbox but playback over Christmas was very poor. Bought the movie from Youtube, watching thru ROKU and all is well with the world. Normally I would have just waited for free on demand or streaming to view a fun movie on this level but the hacking and the threats made the decision for me to both rent and buy.

It seems obvious to say as its made by the same people but if you found This is the end hilarious, you'll love this.Im going to watch it again tomorrow as there was so much comedy I'm sure i missed something. Mixed silly stupid jokes with more sophisticated humour...all funny.The cast were all strong and even the celebrity cameos delivered laughs.Franco plays a similar character to the send up he did of himself in This Is The End. He plays Dave Skylark, an in depth interviewer of shallow celebrities.Rogen, who co-wrote & co- directed gives Franco the best part as he plays the straight man as Skylarks producer who is also desperate to be accepted amongst serious journalists. His wish seems to come true when North Koreon dictator Kim Jon Un invites the pair to interview him.Cue CIA intervention, the pair are roped into a plot to assassinate the despot.

I mean fail as a great movie, but it would still make money, because a lot of people like this kind of brainless movie. I myself enjoy movies that can change your life or just delivers you a message, makes you laugh (in a intelligent way) or just brings you joy... makes you scared, cry or just amazed.I'm not saying the movie is stupid because it criticize (in a way) North Korea.

491,cloarox,Please don't believe the Rating for this movie!,3,28 December 2014,"Have you seen the trailer for this movie... or any of the previews? If so, then sad to say you've seen the best parts. For my showing of this film I went to a local theater over the holidays. The theater was at least half full. Other than an occasional chuckle from one or two people in the audience it soon became apparent this film was not living up to the hype. I'm sure Seth and the rest of the cast had a great time making this film and were probably laughing hysterically most of the time while on set. However the actors personal experiences on set, as in this case, do not always translate to a fun experience for the viewing audience. While clever at times its just another one of the many in a long string of mindless comedies.Thousands of loyal IMDb fans rely heavily on IMDb for movie ratings prior to selecting a movie to watch. Sonys decision to allow the streaming of this film enabled thousands of kids 18 and younger, like my 12 year old nephew, to stream this movie to their tablets or smartphones, after which they giddily submitted their preadolescent vote on IMDb which only served to skew the IMDb rating system. Being fair, and taking the normal IMDb viewing audience into consideration, and assuming this movie had been released to theaters under normal circumstances I would expect this film to have a received an overall rating in the neighborhood of 7. If streaming of new releases becomes the norm IMDb may need to revise their rating algorithm so the overall rating more accurately reflects a ""balance"" cross all sections of the age population. I was seriously worried the other day when I saw this film had a rating of 9.0. Yikes, to think a film of this caliber might find its way into IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time would be a sad day indeed. Like many others, IMDb is my ""Go To"" source for a fair and balanced review rating as presented by the viewing public. Personally I much prefer it over the handful of reviews giving by a cross section of uptight or overly dramatic film critics.",The Interview

I can see why people would give it an undeserving 9 or 10 out of 10 due to that, pumped up TO watch it... but sitting back and being more objective -- it's a solidly funny comedy. Not a classic like There's Something About Mary or Dumb & Dumber the original... but an Original plot line carries it, even though it could have done better.How it the important stuff unfolds in the end -- I give a B-. How the Interview really went down, I give a C+. What carries it above both these grades as a whole is the side-note one-liners and jokes that keep you in it + the very ending, which is Satisfying -- hence, in my mind, giving the movie a Solid B overall (and I can be a tough critic).Overall, how the sh!t went down to unload the finale (the interview, etc) could have been better -- but overall, pretty good.

""why don't you feed your people."" and saying there is concentration camps but never seeing one. or really the people of north Korea being represented in any way other than stereotypical Asians that looked like farmers, or brain washed soldiers the media has raised ""The Interview"" up to a point where it could only fall, it does show north Korea in a bad light. but it pokes fun at America far more, and its message about the main stream media and what it has become is much more an agenda within the film and is a main plot point within the movie. i really liked this movie, but i enjoy this sort of ""slapstick"" and silly humor that is present in most Seth Rogan movies, its another ""Neighbors"" just not as good. and i didn't need to go movies to tell you this, and you don't need to be reading this review to know it either. simply put if you enjoyed ""this is the end"", ""pineapple express"", ""superbad"" etc. you will enjoy this movie too. i will say this about the movie, i think this is the best performance from James Franco i've ever seen. he really puts him self out there with some really funny lines that could have failed and bombed. it only missed the mark once and awhile, more to the late 2nd and 3rd act. is the movie worth 8 stars, i would say no but i really enjoyed it for what it is and most of all i had fun with it. i didn't go into the theater expecting anything from it other than some laughs and i got that in spades. and The Interview has some really good points regarding main stream media that was really smartly done, it just missed its mark on a lot of other aspects.worth a watch, you can't say it isn't entertaining.",The Interview

Would they think it funny to make a movie about, say, a stalker who sets out to kill the arrogant, over-indulged, unfunny Seth Rogan?The filmmakers thought they were so powerful they could slight a whole country and get away with it, though I wouldn't be surprised if Sony Pictures hacked themselves as an excuse to pull the plug on this awful movie.",The Interview

This film didn't join my list until the recent Sony Hack and it pretty much inspired me to get some information about North Korea and thus provided interest into watching the movie: The Interview. Basically as long as you aren't too serious about realism applied to this movie then you should find it to be fine all the same.

Then I heard the film would not be released due to threats of bombings, and I wondered who were the theaters afraid of? North Korean terrorists? OR, could it possibly be a bomb of a movie that would not earn without some additional hype? I watched the movie with my wife, and we both agreed a score of 3 would be generous for the predictable plot. James Franco should be ashamed to put this movie on his résumé. Seth Rogen has done much better work, but I can't really fault his acting in this misfire, but he also takes writing credit for this bomb. Three actors stood out in this film and should be credited for their valiant attempts to make this into a watchable show. Lizzy Caplan, Randall Park and Diana Bang. They gave excellent performances. The action parts of the film were quite acceptable for a comedy, but the laughs for the film were so predictable and so far in between it was painful.

The two stars are not actors I am a fan of and I found their performances dull for Seth Rogan (as usual) and over acting for James Franco (who felt totally miss-cast).The movie currently has a score on this website of 9.2. I suspect this is a reaction vote because it was nearly banned. It is important that this movie was not banned to preserve freedom of speech. The correct score should be around 6.The film lightly touches on the political issues in North Korea. Most notably that money is spent on weapons when it should be spent on looking after the people. Plus of course the leader is made to be seen as some kind of a god. Perhaps this movie will help to open a few eyes within North Korea.The jokes weren't bad, but it wasn't really laugh out loud funny either. There were some rather hilarious moments such as the finger biting incident, but overall the jokes were spoiled by James Franco's awful over acting.This is neither a classic or a terrible movie. It is important that it has been released but there is no need to go and watch it because it just isn't that good. If I could give it 5.5 stars I would.",The Interview
509,duckytape1,Pleasantly Surprised,8,7 February 2015,"We went into watching this movie without expecting too much. We were pleasantly surprised. Seth Rogen and James Franco were well cast together in this movie. I especially like James Franco's and the character he played. He was great. I wasn't too sure about the harsh language in the movie. However, it really didn't come across as offencive given the humour in which it was delivered. It's too bad Kim Jong Un doesn't have a sense of humour. It definitely has its moments. Instead, he condemns it and turns it into a surprise hit. The movie was entertaining, action oriented and delivered. Watch it, you may be pleasantly surprised.",The Interview
510,torguyy,Could Have Been a Lot Better Without All the Stupidity,1,27 December 2014,"As soon as you add Seth Rogan and James Franco in a movie together, you know your going to get a crappy lousy perverted stupid dumb unfunny drug influenced film.These losers are only good at making dumb perverted movies, and this movie also portrays a lot of that. The more Hollywood pushes out films like these, they are only shooting themselves in the foot.This is why today you don't get any good quality movies, its all crap now.At one point Seth Rogan was actually funny, and now its just too much, Hollywood needs to tone it down with all these sex and drug jokes, this is why todays youth are messed up, because they learn from these stupid movies.There were some funny parts, but it was just overall stupid, and they could have made this an Oscar winning movie if executed correctly with the right actors on screen, not losers like Seth Rogan and James Franco.James Franco WAY overacted, it made me sick to my stomach just watching him act so stupid throughout the whole film, nothing but childish unwanted behavior that had came so randomly, and I sometimes honestly wonder if these guys really are on drugs when filming.Eminem admitting he's gay to James in the beginning scene while he's being interviewed, I mean really wtf! Again, its just random and makes no sense.Even if this was to be a comedy, there has to be touches of intellectual humour here and there throughout the movie, but in every damn comedy movie Hollywood pushes out now is based on smoking drugs and sex, STOP IT, its not funny, its lame.A good example for a comedy that has good touches of funny is ""The Other Guys"", with Mark Wahlberg and Will Farrell, now that was actually funny, it didn't need drugs and sex for it to make it funny.Another wasted movie because of the stupidity that Hollywood insists on pushing out, its almost as if they have an agenda to spread sex and drugs to youth all over.",The Interview

The ""hack"" was just a publicity stunt (good strategy Sony) and it seemed to work; yesterday looking at the user rating for this it was 9.6 making it by far the greatest movie ever made. But the majority of those people probably voted 10 because the studio decided to show it online. I saw it and not even close to one of the best movies of all times. Added to my movie collection but odds are it won't be a choice of mine to see on a boring day. Do I suggest seeing it?

I was just amazed on how the movie develops in terms of storyline and emotions and friendship. What i love about this movie is the song chose to portray the death of Kim jong un X). Just love how the lyrics are used to attack Kim jong un's emotion.I highly suggest this movie to everyone! Although the deaths and racism brought in the movie is overrated, I personally think it's not a big of a deal as it's just a movie. once again, Well done to the producers and casts for such an amazing movie.

James Franco delivers a beautiful performance and Seth Rogen compliments him perfectly. There is no boundaries of what Rogen will make fun of and The Interview is an instant classic. Although controversy surrounded this film, the jokes throughout are fantastic. The portrayal of Kim Jong Un is both edgy and comedic. Yes, it received negative reviews because of the controversy but looking past that, a very high quality movie. The combination of Rogen and Franco killed yet another film. The Interview is possibly a foreshadowing of future comedies where absolutely nothing is of limits.",The Interview

The jokes that weren't funny in the first ten minutes got funny as the movie progressed (Kim Jon's obsession with the song ""Firework,"" the idea that Kim had no butt-hole, and ""honeydicking"").There were some serious moments thrown in, like when one of the main characters discovered that the grocery store was filled with fake food. Lower your maturity for two hours to watch this movie. It's worth it.On a random note, I love the fact that some American/Korean guy can say he was Kim Jon Un in a movie.",The Interview
516,isabella-vozar,Excellent but dangerous,9,25 December 2014,"Okay, I'm going to go into this deeply, read everyone else's reviews for the entire low down on the film, such as how good the graphics are. So The Interview was insanely hilarious. I'm a huge movie lover and fan of Seth Rogen so naturally I saw this ASAP. It has the humour of Pineapple express and Bad Neighbours but, despite being insanely unrealistic, this one seems to be less silly in its humour and more just exaggerated on every scale all at the same time as being scarily truthful. We all know that this film has been aimed at NK and bases its story around taking down the 'Supreme Leader' Kim Jong-Un. It makes no attempt at tip toeing around facts. As some people have said, it is basically American Propaganda and The Interview spends it's entire 112 minutes undermining NK's leader in every way possible. Now, take for instance, movies about Hitler. They are, even now, decades after WWII, taken seriously. And some people get offended about them for whatever reason, racism, Nazism whatever, because of how sensitive the topic is. Now, this film is about a live leader who is insanely dangerous. Who has control of 24.9 million people. It's based right now, this year. It's showing American's to be pretty stupid and shallow. It's making the NK's look even more horrible and it mocks them over and over again, angering them. Like poking a rabid dog, waiting for it to snap. Seth Rogen has created the most insensitive film I have ever seen, and showered it in delicious comedy so we get distracted from the impending horror of NK's threat to the world. It absolutely makes you think. It is more than a comedy. If the ridiculous jokes were taken out of this film, it would be so heavy and something that would keep you awake at night. They take every opportunity to make the Kim look a mad man, weak and with an obsession for power. And maybe he is. BUT it is not good to anger someone like that. Everyone s joking around, but when a bomb is dropped of WWIII starts, we'll be cowering in corners because this leader is just another Hitler, another Stalin. Another man who hates everything about what we as westerners live for. As a film and just a film, it was fabulous, hilarious, clever and sharp. I enjoyed it immensely, but I think people should be aware of what lies under it while they watch it. Because these messages impact everyone, rather than taking it lightly, it should be seen as an incredibly clever piece of propaganda. I've given it a 9/10 because it gives food for thought. But not 10/10 because I think it was a dangerous move to have it include the NK names, as it will only provoke aggression. I'm sorry if there are lots of typos, it's late.",The Interview
517,jyocool-pan,Empty vessel makes much noise,4,31 December 2014,"The interview is one of the movies that you expect something big to happen but inside your heart you somewhere already knew it won't be upto the mark. Anyways with the Tsunami of controversies you think that this movie will be out of the box and yes you have hit the jackpot it is out of the box but in a negative way.The interview depicts everything that should not be part of a good entertainment. Logic defying story, bad humor, tasteless acting. I am still giving it 4 coz its new year time and I respect one of the actors for his earlier roles.Do watch at your own risk. You may somehow laugh at some occasions but believe me its better to rent a DVD later when you think that life cannot be worse. :)",The Interview
518,Johnthirio,Instant cult classic,9,30 December 2014,"This movie is dominated by James Franco's presence. The way people can look at his performance is entirely dependent on if you like stoner humor, but if you do, you will probably find him hilarious. I think this is a anti-stock up movie. If you are stuck-up, you can't like this movie, and you will probably hate James Franco's performance. While the jokes mostly all go back to sex/bro humor when both main characters are on the roll, there is a touch of satire at the ""TMZ"" industry, and while it doesn't go deep on the subject of international relations, it does provide a introductory overview of North Korea, with some exaggeration like the Americanization of the North Koreans characters that nevertheless goes well with the humor of the movie.To refer to the international ""crisis"", I think it is not surprising that this movie prompted a reaction from Kim Jong Un himself. In the movie, it clearly implies that you would need to be retarded(like James Franco's character) to believe in Kim's propaganda. Kim Jong Un knows that he can't prevent everybody in his country from watching the Interview, because there is some smuggling of outside media in the country. This movie would have a very different impact on a North Korean than the normal Hollywood flick, almost like we see at the end of the movie. In this sense, the movie reflects what might happens in some parts of the country, people realizing that ""the Great Leader"" is a lie. However, while I don't think this movie will lead to a revolution, it does explain why Kim Jong Un is scared about it; it clearly states that Kim Jong Un is all propaganda.In the end, if you don't like the movie, it's probably because you are a ""Boromir"".",The Interview
519,ionutus,Enjoyable,8,6 February 2015,"I think that viewers opinion on this movie largely depends on their expectations and the mood they are in when watching it. So if you expect another Charlie Chaplin ""The Dictator"" and set yourself for a subtle comedy, you'll be disappointed. This is a Seth Rogen movie, a comedy with thick accents of parody and a dumb plot. I mean, it's a reported and his producer trying to assassinate Kim Jong Un. In my opinion, the movie has decent acting and a decent soundtrack. Is this a fine French Moulleux Au Chocolat desert? No. This is an all American 1$ glazed donuts. Yes, I liked it and I found it funny. Good movie to enjoy with a few beers.",The Interview

Honestly all the hard work that went from faking hacking, nuke threats, etc, is impressive. Kudos to the marketeers. No doubt this movie needed it, as it's one of the worst things i've ever seen.I'm having a hard time not imagining the writers as 14 year old. The comic value of the movie is low, stupid and quite obvious. We have, once again, the stereotype, of Americans being completely dumb and with the same decision making ability of a dog. Lines like ""does drinking margaritas, and listening to Katy Perry make me gay?"" are the common level throughout the movie. Add a random scene with Seth Rogen shoving something up his rectum, because, why the hell not? The dictator that they were supposedly trying to mock, is portrayed at moments as a rapper and a person with gay inclination. Also eminem comes out as gay at the start of the movie. Really? Is this all you can write? You can't tell me grown ups wrote this trash.The quest of the movie (as advertised), was to make fun of the N.Korean leader. However, it turns out to be more harmful to the image of the American people than Kim jong-un.",The Interview

Happenstance be unto you gentle reader, your gentle eyes will water from the brilliant acting and story. It is amaze. I will continue to eat korean noodles because they are so delicious.

522,dardanm,"Mediocre, Unfunny",4,25 December 2014,"I imagine a lot of the 9+ ratings have to do with the controversy. Otherwise, I can't imagine the score would have been higher than 5.I've never been a fan of Franco's acting in comedy films and in this one it was really bad - worst I've seen from him so far. It felt like he didn't practice any of the lines. His comedic timing was just absolutely horrible and ruined a lot of the jokes that had potential. He showcased just how important comedic timing is in order for humor to land.Seth Rogen on the other hand was excellent and it probably helped a lot with his comedic background since his comedic timing was on point every time. It's pretty much the only reason I gave a rating of 4.As for the movie itself, as someone else put it, it's like the green hornet. Funny here and there but it's overdone with forced, unfunny humor. You can still have a comedic film without filling every sentence with forced jokes - something Seth Rogen seems to not grasp over and over since he keeps repeating the same mistakes in his scripts.So is this worth watching? If you're high and with friends, sure. Sober? You'll probably smirk 3 or 4 times but towards the end you will find you wasted your time.",The Interview

DIRECTION- Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen continues to set a milestone in directing a comedy after their movie ""this is the end"".#3.

I watched this movie as my patriotic contribution to free speech.I now realize the idea of free speech is greatly overrated. The North Koreans were emphatically right. This movie should have been burnt.If you like puerile humor, fart jokes, anus jokes, penis jokes, and movies aimed at the intellectual level of a fruit fly, this is for you. This movie could be summed up by their running tag line, which is repeated I don't know how many times during the film:""They hate us because they anus."" (""They hate us because they ain't us."")If you think that is funny, then this movie is for you.There were maybe three or four actually funny lines or situations during this film, but they were embarrassingly overcome by the the screen writers attempt to write a script, in which a certain four letter word beginning with ""F"" appears at least three times in every line of dialog.Do yourself a favor.

526,bananaoftheyear,I don't know what the controversy was about.,5,4 February 2015,"The interview - Dave Skylark (James Franco) and his producer friend Aaron (Seth Rogan) get roped in to killing Kim Jong-un.A job complicated by Dave's growing bromance with the seemingly misunderstood dictator. As Dave gets sucked into 'The Kim Show,' it's up to Aaron to maintain clarity about the mission at hand – before Kim's watchdogs figure out what the duo are up to, and make them disappear forever.Riding on the back of a lot of controversy, The Interview may get swallowed up in the wave of buzz surrounding it – which is ironic, since the movie itself is not all that buzz-worthy, at the end of the day. A weird mishmash of comedic styles, with an odd performance from Franco, the film is no more than a juvenile (albeit fun) political fantasy, as hatched by the minds behind films like Superbad and This Is The End.Directed by Superbad duo Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, The Interview certainly plays more like a sketch show or sitcom rather than a theatrical film. No doubt it's hard to convey the aesthetic of one of the most secluded countries in the world, but many of the set pieces and scene compositions feels like its better suited for an SNL digital short. That excludes a few sequences of bigger-budget set pieces, where things do turn cinematic – if only for half a beat.For all the controversy, in the end, the funniest thing about The Interview may be people's ""Is that what the fuss was about?"" response to the finished product – when they finally get to see it.",The Interview

However I can't even call this garbage a movie. I think that this ""movie"" was hacked by the producers to create the uproar so people go and watch it, and it was still such garbage that nobody would pay to see it, so they sold it to Netflix.

528,Ty1986,These user reviews are artificially deflated for a decent movie,7,24 January 2015,"This movie was actually pretty entertaining. A few things needs to be taken into consideration first... if you don't like the kind of movies that Seth Rogan makes (Neighbors, Pineapple Express, Knocked Up, etc) then you probably won't like this. But if you get any sort of enjoyment out of those movies, then you'll enjoy this. I laughed a lot in this movie and enjoy the banter/""chemistry"" that Rogan and Franco share on screen. They are fun to watch together. I would rate this better than almost any of Rogan's past movies, and very relevant. Now for all the other poor reviews on this site, if you look at any of them, they are all very low to artificially deflate this movie. Many of them don't seem like they've even seen it and rate it low based on the what they think the movie is. Or it's from a person knocking it because they were expecting ""Titanic."" It seems like almost all of the negative reviews were plastered here to discredit the movie and keep people from watching it, hell, it could be the GOP flooding in the poor reviews. In either case, this movie is very enjoyable and leaves you entertained. It's no ""Titanic"" and it doesn't try to be, it is what it set out to be: an entertaining funny movie that surprisingly gets more right about North Korea than you'd think (just read the IMDb trivia).

Well, some may take the joke, but some may take offense. A director should carefully consider delicate matters, unless he wants to make a scandalous film. The same is also true for those movies that hurt people religious feelings. Still it's just not right to make yourself a famous name at the expense of that people.

Seth Rogen as always is worth a few chuckles at best. The rest of the cast is interesting but severely underutilized. There's very little nudity, only quick flashes here/there, and no where near enough gore to earn this an R rating, it should have been rated PG-13 to better match the childish humor and antics of Seth.

So, be in no doubt, if I was a drug-taker who had taken drugs and was high on drugs, I would be like this movie. These things work both ways. This movie is like stuff. It's really metaphorical.

What did you expect going into a movie about interviewing kim jong un starring seth rogen and james franco? Mature jokes with deep political commentary andmarlon brando reincarnated into seth rogen and a usual suspects level plot or sum? Ofc not, it isnt supposed to be that, its supposed to be a movie that makes normal people laugh, not 45 year olds who have watched the entirety of imdbs top 250 list.
Now that my 4 years too late rant is out of the way let me talk about the movie. The idea behind it is genius, it's unlike any comedy ive seen, it's honestly refreshing and although it's about kim jong it doesnt try to be too political or give a lesson or commentary -other than a little bit- about anything cause who cares fr im supposed to laugh not start a conversation.
The fact that north korea hacked sony because of this movie just makes it so much funnier, try to keep it in mind and imagine kim jong un watching it, made this even more hilarious for me on my 3rd watch.

540,sporebubu,"In spite of the controversial topic, its a bland film",4,31 May 2020,"The movie was surrounded by controversy when it released, and i'm pretty sure that controversy is why it even received attention in the first place. Having only watched it for the first time this year i can say it does not hold up.
Its an absurd movie, but in the bad way, the plot is dumb, the characters are shallow and the spirit to spread a genuinely important message is there its hidden too much behind corny jokes and cliche dialogue to really be an important part of the movie.
I will admit, there were a few jokes and scenes that genuinely cracked me up and its a fun movie to watch once, maybe twice if you're with friends, but other then that there's not much this movie has going for it.",The Interview
541,PS2906,Overall good movie,7,5 July 2020,"If we look at the movie from a late night comedy perspective, it was perfect movie with a hint of action and a lot of jokes.
Halfway through the movie, it takes a different route, and becomes more unserious, which is fine.
The acting is great, though sometimes you would maybe think to yourself, ""Where is this going to go?"", but for the most parts it picks up again and gets even more hilarious.
I would've liked to see a more serious perspective sometimes in the movie, because it is in fact an action/comedy, and would've loved to see Seth Rogen in a more concentrated state sometimes.
But overall great movie, would recommend.",The Interview
542,kovesp,How can anything be so bad...,1,26 January 2015,"I started to watch on Netflix. I lasted 25 minutes. I think it was only that long, because I was too stunned that something can be so bad and be called a movie. If the Sony hack was really done by NK to prevent the showing of this thing (I'll use this term so as not to dignify it by calling it a movie again) then there is a real contest in idiocy between NK and producers, and I am not sure who wins. It may be expedient to introduce changes to the rating system in support of things such as this (though I hope it is a unique, never to be repeated phenomenon). It is degrading to all those movies that have been rated 1 that it is not possible to give say -10 to this production. Netflix categorized it as 'Absurd', I think it is absurd to call it a movie.",The Interview

Yes, the humor is grouse in places just like Animal House was almost 30 years ago and unsuitable for children or prudes.But everyone else with a sense of humor will really enjoy the movie.The acting is fine. I understand there are some complaints the N. Koreans are being libeled, but I thought that only applied when what you say isn't true. I strongly suggest you go see The Interview.",The Interview

There is absolutely nothing about it that I care to quote, and it would not be memorable except for the brouhaha it has caused.If you get a chance to watch it, don't rate it for the content, but because a rating of ten will serve to further upset those who try to disrupt the lives of innocent people and control freedom of speech and expression.",The Interview
546,manhie,What do you think,6,27 December 2014,"I haven't seen this movie. Several days ago (12/24/2014) my son said that on IMDb it was rated 9.4 which is a very high score. I further researched on it. Though it is rated 9.4 by IMDb users, by demographics, users under the age of 18 gave the highest rating (9.7). Metacritics gave it an overall score of 5.1 which is below par. I also reviewed Rotten Apple score which gave it at 6.2. The movie critic from Wall Street Journal said that we can debate whether or not certain interrogation methodology is torture or not torture but watching this movie from start to finish is a torture. Currently, IMDb users rate this movie at 8.1 which is still fabulous but not the sensational score of 9.4. Also, currently it is rated at (9.1) by the age group of 18 and under.Moving forward, 12/31/2014. I further check the rating score. Over 50% (52,000+) of the viewers gave a perfect score of 10 but the overall score is 7.5. It means that over half of the viewers who love this movie, it would give it a 10. It doesn't make sense.",The Interview

No sir, I have full blown ass cancer. So when my darling wife came into the ICU today to happily inform me that I could watch the latest opus of masterpiece film making by the walking geniuses Seth Rogen and James Franco, it was through the lens of intense, ass-agonizing pain.When the screen of the laptop first gave birth to this majestic dance of comedy and discrete intellectual subtext my body began to feel lighter, as if I were becoming adrift on a gentle breeze of love. Even the dessicated remains of my lower digestive system seemed to firm back into something resembling a human shape.For the next hour and a half I was transported to a wonderland of pure bliss and elated harmony. When finally the trace of peace and joy fell away, I was aware of my wife now sobbing uncontrollably. I asked what was wrong and when she lifted her head I could see they were tears of joy. She pulled back the sheets on my hospital bed and held up a mirror.My breath was taken from me.Where once there was a loose tube of yellowed and decaying flesh draped from where my rectum once was to mid-thigh, there was now just a perfectly shaped and proportionate butt. My backside was not just restored, but enhanced by the magic in this movie. I have a new lease on life thanks to The Interview. I hope every living soul on the planet watches this movie and finds a new lease on life because of it.",The Interview

Both of them were a wast of my time only reason I was able finish them was I was at work and they were playing in the background. I have a feeling people are artificially voting this movie up due to all the media attention surrounding this movie. If this movie were released under normal circumstances it probably would have flopped in the box offices. I image it would've gotten between a 5 or 6 in terms of IMDb ratings. Don't bother paying to watch this.I don't normally write reviews but I feel like I was mislead by the reviews for this particular movie. When I went to watch the film it was rated 9.1.,The Interview

I literally fell asleep watching this movie, woke up an hour later to find out that I've missed nothing, and it's still as boring as it was throughout the whole first 30 minutes, and even though I love both Seth Rogan, and James Franco, it felt like they really weren't into this, they just wanted to get through with it, more like forcing pointless bad jokes into their act for the viewer to at least say I've had a couple of laughs watching this, but I didn't, and I believe anyone else who actually appreciates good movies would say the same, here's my advice, save your self the money, and the time, and watch something else instead cause this sure isn't worth your time.",The Interview
550,paperszh,a rather flat comedy,1,27 December 2014,"Glad to see its rating is steadily decreasing, and approaches to its true value. The plot is weak, dumb and not entertaining. Many comedies nowadays seem to falsely consider dumbness to be humour. Audience are not 3-year old kids!The acting is not funny, and Seth Rogen is acting the same way in most of his films. The movie is full of second-handed sex jokes which have been used thousands of times in numerous low-quality comedy movies.Without all stories outside the movie, this one is not attractive at all.Don't waste your time and money, if you seriously want to kill some time with truly well-made comedies.",The Interview

Although the entire concept seems like it could have been a hilarious, amazing comedy, it is not.I laughed a total of negative 5 times. This movie was not funny at all. Don't waste your money watching it. Wait until you can somehow watch it for free if you desperately want to see it, but truly it is not worth your damn time.Really, do not believe the people who rate this 10/10.

There will be some that get upset and down vote this film because ""they didn't even crack a smile"". These people probably never crack a smile and probably hate on a lot of things. These are the type of people that make ""12 Years a Slave"" best picture. If you like to laugh and don't take yourself too seriously then this is the movie for you. It's a brilliant satire that pokes fun at the N. Korean dictatorship in many different ways. The jokes are on point and James Franco really delivers. I don't know what it is about him but I just really enjoy watching him be goofy. 10 out of 10 and yes, the controversy adds to the rating.",The Interview

There is a surprising amount of heart put into the characters and their relationships with each other. The story has some pretty awesome plot twists and I have to say that it gets better the further it goes. In the beginning, James Franco's acting is kind of overdone and fake looking but when he does the official Kim Jong Un interview, he NAILS it. His acting in that scene was so good for a moment I forgot he was James Franco. Plus I love the running joke throughout the movie about 'honeypotting' people and everybody getting 'honeypotted'. Also, the tiger scene was so freaking funny. And the Eminem scene too, that totally got me! Overall I would say that The Interview started out like a typical Seth Rogan comedy with his usual antics but it ended up in a crazy heartwarming strange place.",The Interview

There are some particular outrageous moments...mostly served up by Franco but you should just go along for the adventure and enjoy it for what it is: crass humor at its best. But in addition to laughing hysterically at scene after scene, I did find myself trying to guess who was playing who so in addition to the hilarity, I found myself wanted to keep watching to see how it all played out. I expected to laugh, it was a bonus to actually care how it ended. Extra Bonus: Lizzy Caplan is understated yet awesome as the lead CIA agent!",The Interview

A great scam by a big company to sell a sad excuse for a movie. I think N. Korea might have actually wanted to save us from watching it. Not because it made fun of them, but because it is so bad. But like all hype, it seems to have fooled me and a large amount of others. Poorly written jokes, so so acting, and a drawn out plot. It took me 45 minutes to get a quick laugh. I normally love the Franco/Rogen team, but this was awful. Not sure if the ratings are high because people love it, or just to tick off N.Korea. I know people will still watch it, but don't be surprised if it left you going ""meh"" like me.",The Interview

Should have I got mad when they blew up Finland, my home country in South Park? Well i didn't because it's only fiction and you shouldn't get mad about it. There are much weird, disturbing and even very sick movies, but some call them art. I call this art and laughed my ass off watching it. This movie did what it was supposed to do: It made me laugh hard. Not many movies can do that anymore. But this is my opinion.

I enjoy this genre of film. However this one makes Scary Movie 4 look like Gone with the Wind. Unlike American Carol and Team America which were creative, humerus and well scripted, this movie comes across as if written on a cocktail napkin after 12 beers and 6 shots of tequila by horny adolescents. There is no redeeming value anywhere in the film. The script is awful, the story line is boring and predictable. How many times are we to be subjected to multiple 'boners' as the funny parts of a film. I like my crazy movies like Lost Skeleton of Cadaver and the Evil Dead trilogy. The only redeeming feature of the movie is that it will be quickly forgotten. What a waste of 112 minutes and five bucks..",The Interview

They reflect on the strength of the American people in times of great peril. When the filthy commies threaten American soil, when they try to use violence and terror to influence our actions, the only thing that a true American can do is stand up and say, ""No."" It is the only way that we can live in a world without fear.

As expected it's absolute garbage, the humour isn't funny at all but then again who would have high expectations from a Seth Rogen film. The story isn't even slightly interesting, it's basically propaganda where they seem to be having a dig at North Korea whenever they see the opportunity, now I'm guessing that's why it's so highly rated. Don't waste your time unless you genuinely do like this idiotic type of humour that's related to the actors starring here.I'd of rated it lower but because I finished the whole thing I guess it warrants a 2.",The Interview

Tonight - After watching it myself - I see there are mostly negative reviews, all very negative about the type of movie ""The Interview"" turned out to be. Well I actually think it was pretty good - And i think the key is to adjust your expectations - Immediately upon seeing the main actors and reading about the movie people should understand that we are dealing with an American comedy - And from the actors the style of comedy should be expected. (Teen style humor and lots of sex and ass references) - Still I liked the movie - Mainly because I think North Korea should be challenged much more on the big screen, but I also think the main characters had great chemistry - I found the Kim character enjoyable (if a bit too over the top) and the parallels that I at least saw between Skylark and his fascination of Kim and then the very real Dennis Rodmann who we saw visiting the DPRK some time ago and declaring he was friends with Kim Jong Un.I think if you take for what it is - A light comedy that tries to take up a subject which is in desparat need for brave people to do exactly this.

I was never going to see it and I still won't see it even if it gets approved through another venue. It was most likely going to be another stupid comedy in the sea of hundreds of other stupid comedies. I won't be giving a crappy movie a good rating simply because it was prevented from being released. I really can't think of a more lousy way for a movie to get onto the top rated film list. It wasn't going to be anything special and I refuse to rate it as such. Maybe my low rating will at least cancel out the vote of one idiot.,The Interview

There are no dull parts and the jokes don't lack imagination.Overall, I really liked the entire plot of the film and the humour added to a very serious topic.

Use some common sense people!!! No company has ever advertised for a movie to come out, ""hacked themselves"", made their own stock prices drop nearly 10%, killed all Internet advertisements, then turned around and released the movie at limited venues and online at the same time.

It will never live up to the hype surrounding it, but it is FUNNY! It is an over-the-top goof-ball comedy and that's all it was intended to be.

Franco and Rogen are excellent as are the costars and cameos like M&M and Rob Lowe. Although the movie was at times silly and with a lot of body fluids humor, it interesting that the characters, both good and bad, seemed well motivated and not reduced to cutouts. Because it has a strong political message it will be nominated for an Academy Award and might win.The Franco character is particularly interesting. Not playing himself this time. Sort of a cross between Geraldo and Mario Lopez, although his character says he gets more women than Ellen Degeneris.

The movie is fun, James Franco and Seth Rogen are hilarious, Randall Park created a cruel but also very sympathizable dictator junior, and the music in the movie is pretty good. The only problem I have with this movie is that I don't think it's a good idea to actually use the 'Kim Jung Un' to name the character, it makes the movie a little too much 'political', this is supposed to be a comedy, it's just for fun, so why bother to act like it's trying to implicate some real problems in reality while we have bunch of other channels of information for those issues, I think this only makes the movie take some propaganda taste.

575,rt_maddy,Enjoyable and funny,8,31 December 2014,"Evan Goldberg's and Seth Rogen's ""The Interview"", starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, follows a journey of interviewer Dave Skylark and producer Aaron Rapaport as they travel to North Korea and assassinate Kim Jong UN. This is nothing different than their previous film ""This Is the End"" yet joy is still found within certain aspects of the film whilst improving from certain flaws of their previous film. What stands out within the ""The Interview"" is the directors' input of satirical humor. An example of this is aimed to the American media. Today, within America's media, it is seemed that people only focus on gossip related to public figures or celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's marriage or Shia LaBeouf's unusual behaviour. This idea is cleverly mocked within Eminem's cameo of the film. Within Eminem's admittance of being homosexual, the reactions of Seth Rogen's Aaron Rapaport and supporting characters are ridiculously over the top and exaggerated whilst being intelligently humorous to the wide audience. Another aspect that is thoroughly enjoyed within ""The Interview"" is the characters. Straight away, the strong chemistry shared within Seth Rogen and James Franco supports the portrayal of their respective roles as there are seen as lovable and funny throughout the film. In addition, Randall Park's presence as Kim Jong Un was perfect for this particular film he was able to help the character suit the film's atmosphere with his excellent acting. All was asked for an exaggerated portrayal of Kim Jong Un and as a result Randall Park completed the objective with great notion. However, what shine the most are the female performances of the film, Diana Bang and Lizzy Caplin. Within their respective roles, Sook and Agent Lacey, both characters are surprisingly funnier than Franco's and Rogen's roles. Even though they had less presence within the film, their well written dialogue is justified with their excellent execution and acting. When focusing on the way the film was written, that is when the film starts to degrade. The first act was amazing, funny, clever and great satirical material. However, as we reach within the second act, the film doesn't shatter into pieces, it crumbles. Funny? Yes, but not to the standard I expect from this film, they require to know when to not use too much toilet humor. As for the final act, it improves a lot as they are able mix comedy with solid action while also creating tension. Overall, ""The Interview"" is another great example to note from Seth Rogen's and Evan Goldberg's directing career as it enjoyable to watch with its hilarity and satirical material yet they need to know when to cross the line on toilet humor.",The Interview

Otherwise it is pretty lame. Other than the Eminem cameo and the tiger scene, there was little to laugh about. The few funny scenes scattered throughout the movie are not really worth the sit-through. The magic that Rogen and Franco may have had in movies like Pineapple Express is diminished. Or maybe I just didn't have enough weed to sit through this and actually enjoy it. No, weed probably won't help with this one. This is more of a have-to-see-because-everyone-else-is-talking-about-it kind of movie. Don't expect too many laughs.",The Interview
577,caborn12,Ruddy bloody excellent,4,22 December 2014,"Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Chaucer - those are just some of the people who are left scrambling around on their backsides in the dust trail left behind by this film. I could attempt to rave further about it, but is simply hard to express to fellow mere mortals how sumptuous this film truly is. The film follows an overweight chap with pubic hair on his head and James Franco (that bloke you thought you recognised from that Wizard of Oz reboot thing a couple of years ago) as they, just a couple of pesky ne'er-do-wells, are tasked by the American version of MI6 to kill the leader of North Korea. Magnificent (and, to some undoubtedly, slightly erotic) joyous action ensues. I shall avoid spoilers but rest assured, the ending rivals that of Romeo and Juliet. I notice the inferior Shakespeare has had his work translated into pretty much every language on earth. I await the North Korean version with trouser-tingling anticipation.",The Interview
578,BlindGuardian117,Not worth the hype,3,1 January 2015,"SPOILERSIn the first half hour they tell you the entire plot. Not kidding. The ""tell all"" Franco speaks of is what happens.All of the humor is dry.There is way too much swearing.If Eminem is considered gay with that fake interview then everyone in the movie should be considered gay. Every time Franco opened his mouth I cringed. The interview with Un was 5 minutes long.The only good thing: the main actors look like the people from Rooster Teeth. Franco looks like a Matt Hullum/Joel Heyman blend and Seth Rogen looks like Burnie Burnes. Imagining them is what got me though the movie. Actually Rooster Teeth could have done it way better and made it funnier. I would go see a Rooster Teeth version of this movie.",The Interview

I just didn't suspect it to be this awful.This is more of Archer Fan-fiction ,inspired by the most low brow of South Park episodes, written by 12 year old kids after they found where dad hid the beer and the marijuana in the garage. The story has zero effort put into it.If the whole story of DPRK cyber attacks is true then they were only doing it to spare us this piece of trash.Not funny, not entertaining, talentless and offensive to the viewer's intelligence.

580,nolanduncan,The Question Is: Would I Buy This Movie?,4,25 December 2014,"As December 25th finally arrived with the international community stirred anew, The Interview, starring Seth Rogan and James Franco, sparked my curiosity charmingly. But as they say: there is no such thing as bad PR, and that (along with the explosions) is what I believe attracted audiences to see this film more than anything. Before any animosities against my particular opinion, understand these following points of analysis:When I watched the first thirty minutes of the film, I really didn't feel too excited as James Franco's main character, Dave Skylark, was conveniently hooked up to interview the Supreme Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un. On the contrary, my reaction was a subtle *so what?* I felt it was too convenient and unrealistic. I understand some viewers like that about these types of movies; they're simple, and it has an excuse as a silly comedy. At the same time, however, it just isn't tasteful. I may have laughed a few times at the Katy Perry in the tank scene or the overweight child in front of the fake grocery store part, but other than that, I didn't find it that entertaining. ""Haters gonna hate"" or ""They hate us because they ain't us/anus?"" I feel as though the humor was thought up by a first grader, not to mention the endless cusses, innuendos, and perverted sentiments. Like I stated before: tasteless in my opinion.If I could point out the most interesting section of this film -- if we are going by a simple beginning, middle, and end structure -- it would indeed have to be the second act, the middle. The scenes displaying Kim Jong Un and his emotional side actually struck a thought in my mind of the real scenario in NK at the moment. It displayed a piece of humanity, something the audience can relate to. Unfortunately, the ludicrous antics appeared once more, and I lost the sense of depth with the character. The final act felt rushed, as if the writers were just adding and not subtracting ideas to fill up the 120 pages for the script. Even in a comedy, I don't fully comprehend why this film was so over-the-top or why it appeared so jumpy. Again, I cannot emphasize it enough; there is no empathetic connection. There is so much I can scrutinize about this film, but to display a less cynical side of this review, I would like to commend the props, special effects, and editors for the visual appeasement. Ultimately, no, I would not add this to my movie collection. With that in mind, this is the conclusion of my skepticism. Hope you agreed and enjoyed the review. Thanks guys!",The Interview

582,samuelpatterson,Not the biggest waste of time...,6,25 December 2014,"Not the biggest waste of time... is probably the biggest compliment I can give 'The Interview' I think we all know everyone wanted to see this film since it's been non stop in the news. I personally wanted to see it since they announced it as I've always been a huge fan of Goldberg, Rogen and Franco and although other people hate it I absolutely loved 'This Is The End' so had high expectations for this film. The plot is mental. but what did you expect from these guys. It has the similar feel of a Goldberg and Rogen movie (plenty of sex jokes, innuendos and the typical girl who is definitely out of Rogens league...) however this film to me felt a lot more political, personal and less fun than their previous work. Kim Jong Un isn't really the best person to make fun of (as we have all found out) and although it's not the worst idea for a plot it was always risky business from the start with this one. Rogen and Francos chemistry saves it slightly so if you enjoy them together there is no denying they will give you a smile but its no work of art and I don't think I laughed out loud once. It's crazy, offensive, political, action packed and full of sex jokes. I don't normally mind that if it fits the film, but a film about North Korea and a film where Skylark (Franco) and Kim Jong Un (who is played by a very camp Randall Park) spend a scene singing Katy Perry in a tank (yes you read that right and it probably isn't the weirdest scene) just does not work for me. It hurts to write this as I love these guys and will always stick up for them when people write off their films from the start but there isn't much defending this one I'm afraid lads and it might not have been the worst idea to have it banned from cinemas... worth a watch but maybe only on Christmas Day when you've already had a few...",The Interview

You know that feeling when you actually feel sorry for the actors and the team who made the movie? No? Well watch this movie and you'll know what I mean It's full of those embarrassingly and awkward moments when you have that sorry feeling. I mean common - Seth Rogen, Franco....REALLY?!?Ow and yeah. Even though this is a comedy and never meant to give any message to anyone...it actually does. Stupid Hollywood. Ignorance (putting it nicely) of issues which for some people mean horrible horrible lives, generations of suffering, starvation, concentration camps...yet this movie kind of tries to put some message about it yet fails miserably....insultingly actually.But yeah - plenty movies insulting to other cultures/world issues..etc.. yet I cant remember one being so terribly boring.Picture the worst movie you've seen in 2 years. Got it? OK, so that was an Oscar movie compared to this one :(The whole thing ""ow we're not gonna release it"" is actually a really nice trick to make ppl pay to watch it online.

You have all been conned to those who gave 10.Sony uses desperate schemes because their company is in the brink of collapse. How are their Vaio and television sales lately? Anyway, I stopped watching the trailer in less than 15 seconds because actors were so corny. This is another bad choice for James Franco's career.

Maybe I'm just too far past the intended demographic, but normally I enjoy some low-level laughs. The two stars either were given too much leeway with ad-lib or the entire script was written by a 19 year old sex-starved lad. Don't fall for all the hoopla- this is a reasonably laughable film, but you're not going to be rolling out of your seat unless you're the dumb ass behind me. The two stars are not legendary enough to get laughs just for making faces and spouting out common lines. It might be amusing if they were in your close circle of friends and you could jab them about it later, but all-in-all, it's not Hollywood level acting.Sad to say that it will probably be successful enough to be done again.A good hacking was well-deserved for this film.",The Interview
587,s-a-y-mattock,from someone who actually watched the movie,9,15 January 2015,a great movie comedy highlighting North Korea as what it is. A crazy leader who care nothing for his people. the idea is to show to his people and to the world what a douche he is. And to make it funny and interesting having dumb and dumber do the interview and miraculously get away with it. and there's a puppy for good measure. no its not as comedic as Seth's other movies like TED and the world ending but he has a more seriously political pull to it.

Quite funny and good acting all around.James Franco puts in a strong performance in The Interview and his character is both funny and likable. While the film certainly has a couple of missteps (not all the jokes work), as a whole I was more than satisfied. It is a goofy and ridiculous movie that does not take itself too seriously. Fans of James Franco and Seth Rogan's previous works will enjoy this film. I can also see why Kim might not be so happy about it.All in all, a good movie and highly recommended so long as you don't expect something more out of the ordinary for these two actors.",The Interview

Rogen and James Franco--a consistently good butt of the ""joke,"" perform up to standard most of the way--plot momentum difficult to perpetuate in satires given that plot matters little, and belly laughs not truly a part of the experience--thus not an ""A"" grade satire. Nevertheless, apropos franchise demands, select scenes between Rogen and Franco alone prove worth the price of admission. Concerning the brouhaha with the North Korean government, particularly the boy-king autocrat Kim Jong Un, Rogen and writer would have been well-advised to use fictional names.

The pace was not too slow..... the comic was not too vulgar.... and we just simply found it to be entertaining enough when you just want to have a moment of silly laughs. They took a lot of issues known in reality and wove it into the film mixed with their own take on how they want the movie to go which was fine with us because it did not ridiculously deviate from reality while at the same time it presented the situation and main character in a fresh way other than how mainstream media might.,The Interview

I'm actually happy I saw the movie. James Franco is a great actor and his facial expressions are just amazing. The storyline wasn't great, but you can't expect it to be. It's a movie where they make fun of a dictator and just humiliate him by showing his 'soft' side.Some of the parts from early in the movie return at the end which was pretty funny if you ask me. The jokes are simple, but effective and they really work. Yes, there were some moments in the movie which I didn't like, but almost every movie got those moments. It was a funny movie and I'm glad I've seen it. A lot of the negative reviews are just based on wrong expectations.

594,c-smith1776,Boring Racist Sexist-a Hollywood boy's club movie,1,29 December 2014,"In the film Seth Rogan's character tries to prove himself to be a more serious producer by securing Skylark an interview with the Kim Jong Un. The movie drags its feet tediously for thirty minutes to get to that point. Not before it casually mocks the gay community with making Eminem come out as a closet homosexual homophobic stereotype.When the movie starts to pick up the only two female characters that show up in this all white male cast are used as props. The role of the CIA female agent is to ""honey pot"" the men by appealing to the party-going, privileged, chauvinist, Skylark's love of big boobs, revealing cleavage, long hair and glasses. It turns out later the CIA agent never had long hair or wore glasses. Same goes for Sook. Her role was to be the yellow fever fetish object of Rogan's character.Many racist Asian stereotypes then ensue once they agree to interview President Kim. Rogan gets a little skit where he mispronounces words in a fake Asian accent. In fact, speaking in a caricatured version of an Asian accent was the requirement of all English speaking Asians in the movie. There were many moments when Park who plays President Kim seemed to have broken character, lost his accent and got tired of playing offensive racist stereotypes himself. I sympathize for Park- he seems to have potential as an actor. Park is one of many Asian men who rarely get any role in Hollywood and now he probably finds himself doing the last thing he ever wanted to play in a movie.The movie was dreadful because it was blatantly done at the expense of oppressing women and Asians. It was painful to watch because it exposed how James Franco and Seth Rogan cannot carry movie by themselves without resorting to gimmicks. They overacted and strained their faces trying to pull off every joke like they're waiting for an audience to respond. I'm disappointed in the lead actors of the film because they have so much Hollywood hype behind them and now I don't know why people liked them in the first place. I wouldn't recommend the movie to anyone looking for a fun holiday film. It was also painful to watch because the women and Asian people in it did not seem to be enjoying themselves either. I just hope this film won't be elevated to the status of a propaganda film the U.S.A. uses to justify using force to intervene with Third World countries and later archived.",The Interview

I expected something more political but it gave me an awesome duo of comedy and satire. It is definitely not a typical Seth Rogen movie with the nonsense comedy. And it surely is one hell of a funny film. It has got all the elements to make an interesting movie and makes us remain glued to our seats. The movie is getting a lot of negative reviews. But guys, it definitely is a great movie. Even the best Seth Rogen movie i have ever seen. Its not that great a movie to meet its over-hyped appreciation but surely is a must watch for everyone. Even the dialogues of the movie and the jokes used are totally new and not used before. And seriously, it was NOT a waste of my time. I enjoyed every bit of the Action, Comedy, Plot and acting. A totally great movie. Seth Rogen brought this movie and literally stunned me as i thought this would have again been a nonsense comedy with the same old jokes, weed. But it was something much more which he never presented before. Though the Kim Jong-Un portrayal was a little over the top and might not be true but still, that cannot change my outlook towards this movie. It is the most enjoyable movie of this year and gave it the perfect ending which was missing.

I find that this film sifted and stirred emotion, delight and humor in me with both a poignant and disquieting ""after sentiment.""I cannot attest to that being the intent of the Writers, Producers and Directors but do feel that some of the cheesiness was an intentional masking of darker issues; helping audiences look into very troublesome global community concerns from their own comfort.

600,Agedapocolypse,Well worth a viewing or two.,9,28 December 2014,"I will have some spoilers. There is a lot of criticism for this movie in that it was so horribly written and executed or that the acting was bad, but I feel people are being too nit-picky about the movie. It's a comedy, it's not supposed to be taken seriously in any sense of the word. This movie was very funny because while it does make fun of some of the outrageous beliefs that North Korea is said to have towards their leader(s), it also makes a valid point when Kim Jung Un talks to Franco about how he actually never saw any cruelty taking place when he was physically in N. Korea, but he still pushed the envelope that the regime was oppressing people. There was a US reporter going through the Soviet Union and parts of Ukraine when they were accusing Stalin of committing genocide against the people of Ukraine during the Holodomor, but the reporter never actually saw any starving people although he did say he saw tonnes of food sitting in piles rotting and not being sent to the people of Ukraine to aid the hungry (identical to the movie where their trip was planned perfectly to show them around, but never showing them anything that wasn't authorized). This movie is very funny, but it's not like in other movies where every statement is a laugh or something. There's build-up to the laughs and it makes them all the more rewarding instead of having a chuckle at everything being said and done so you become desensitized to the humor. If you know anything about International Politics/Relations or the Theory on War as an area of study, you'd know there is an entire part of them that is dedicated to understanding why countries go to war and they try to explain why so many countries go about saber-rattling (North Korea with Kim Jung Il/Un). The Interview actually does a very good job at showing how international criticism has led Kim Jung Un to pushing for nuclear war. Being a dictator, Kim Jung Un has to follow very closely to Machiavelli's *The Prince* in that it's great if you can get people to like you, but if you can't then you'd best make sure they fear you. That has been how dictators have kept their power throughout the millennium and so you can see that the pushing and prodding of North Korea can force its ruler's hand because if they are seen as weak, they will be ousted. Whether it's by the people or someone that works for them who is willing to try and grab a higher office. One of my favorite parts about this movie is how King Jung Un was ""seducing"" Franco, the media, so that he can have a 'fair' interview about his nation and Franco buys into it all because of the little fanfare he is given upon his arrival (ignoring Rogan telling him that it's all lies as per what other parts of the media say). I saw this as a wonderful play on how the media can be twisted by just about anyone and then they go out and spread that twisted ""truth"" they were shown. Not to mention that it also reminds me of Jane Fonda and her time with the VietCong as a media starlet to tell people the US was evil for what it was doing to those 'wonderful' people. From reviews I have been reading this movie got a lot of bad criticism, but I feel it was a very well done movie and so far my favorite of Seth Rogan's outside of *This Is The End*. It is very entertaining. Is it the greatest movie of the year? No, of course not. Then again, when is any comedy the best movie of the year? Being what it is (a comedy), it was very good and in no way disappointing. The only reason this movie didn't get a 10/10 by me is because Rogan didn't get his happy ever after in the end after he sacrificed his appendages for a cause that wasn't his.",The Interview

602,travisfor45,The Dream Team Is Back!,8,14 August 2016,"The Interview is a very fun and laugh out loud movie. I find the chemistry between Rogen and Franco to always be enjoyable. In this movie though, I feel like Rogen got carried by Franco. Obviously, Franco had more more significant part in this movie, but to be carried is expected when you also direct. I don't hold it against you Seth.It begins strong and stays strong for a while. They begin interviewing celebrities and being silly. That was great, but Rogen got upset when someone he went to college with told him that he wasn't a ""real journalist"". This was fine and all, but it could have been more creative with the way that they ended up in North Korea.They party and everything, but that's expected because it's Rogen. Then Lizzy Caplan gets thrown into the mix. This was weird for me. They used her as a sex symbol and she just threw me off every once in a while. She's attractive, but I could have went without her seducing them. I'm sure they would have agreed without her showing them her boobs.One thing that bugged me was the use of Katy Perry. Yeah, it would have been fine once or twice, but they used it so many times. I mean, is Firework even that good of a song? They could have used something else to make Kim sad, but I'm just being picky.The editing on some of the movie was terrible. I even noticed that they would cut them out half way through a word sometimes. This would be fine if it was intentional, but it wasn't. It was just put together really fast. For a movie that almost started a war, you would think they would make it perfect.Overall: The Interview was a fun time and had me thinking. I feel like this could really happen to America and North Korea. From this movie, I hope they send Franco and Rogen to the rescue. If you want to see this movie, do not hesitate. It's one of Rogen's masterpieces and will not be forgotten. If you want a movie that would make a country mad and still make you laugh, watch The Interview. The comedy dream team is back at it again.

Sure its stupid tho in most terms but its damn funny and the pacing is perfect . i am blown away :DSo the whole movie is about those 2 guys ( producer and Dave Skyler - or something like that ) who are running a Late night show doing all the fun stuff with celebrities , such as revealing Eminem is gay ( true story ) . but at one point , They want to change and it turns out Kim Jon Un loves Skyler's late night show ! and both of them going to do a interview with the dictator. Along the way they get hired by the CIA to kill him and well everything turns into a stupid hilarious Movie with lots of boobs , a Kim Jon UN who is kinda gay and loves Katie perry and the most dumbest Wiener and sex jokes of all time . ending in the final interview to reveal Kim Jon Un's nature to his country .but although this movie is mostly about Wieners , Doing bitches and having all the stupid fun we had with this is the end , the movie has some serious parts as well . it beautifully shows how cruel Kim Jon UN is . and that Kim Jon UN is just as powerful because people worship him as their god. the movie shows how 'amazing' Kim's life is , but in relation how cruel his country starves and how deep the propaganda goes. oh and this movie is so about Anuses !all in all : this movie was the best and funniest brain F**k since this is The end ! 8/10 !",The Interview

Did it make me giggle? Of course! As a comedy, The Interview is okay. It made me laugh at the sheer stupidity of Franco's character juxtaposed with Rogen's slightly more rational personality. From then on, the laughs can be found by poking fun at Kim Jong Un, so I guess that could be the satire in the movie. Can it hold a candle to Kubrick's satirical masterpiece, ""Dr. Strangelove""? Heck no. But, the important thing to remember is The Interview is a comedy, with a laugh or two by America's bromance of the year, Franco and Rogen. The movie's worth the money but we'll only remember The Interview as one of the few films that managed to greatly affect the real world, for better or for worse. Not many movies can say they did that.",The Interview

I have always been a fan of Seth Rogan and his writing, but get him and James Franco together... Guaranteed laughter! James portrays a politically uninformed yet happy go lucky talk-show host who loves his life, and Seth is his overqualified producer who feels his career is at a dead end. When an obscure news article about the north Korean dictators love for the show arises, Seth sees his chance at a real interview and getting the respect from his piers. The CIA Getting wind of James being granted a rare audience with the reclusive dictator, see a chance to take him out. What follows is an endless barrage of Hillary! Randall Park's portrayal of Kim Jong-UN is nothing short of hilarious and scary at the same time! This is obviously a comedy and not to be taken seriously, you want serious, watch 60 minutes!

Cowards. Overall it was funny, it's no Oscar winner. It pretty much points out the facts we already know about North Korea and makes them funny. I personally downloaded the movie and laugh my butt of, but being that it is a comedy I give it 5 stars. I don't understand how it has a 7.8, to much hype only because Sony was scared.

I know that particular demographic will just love this one. All I can say is that the only flicker of professionalism is the performance of Randall Park. It's obvious why SONY concocted the whole hacking thing. They're just trying to minimize their losses. As a corporation, the executives are obligated to maximize profits regardless of any detrimental effects on society. When a corporate entity creates a fraudulent circumstance that is an obvious threat to national security by accusing another military power of hacking a major data-base, it's time to look at the laws regarding behavior of corporate entities. If I were the U.S. president I would seize all of SONY's assets and do a thorough investigation and arrest the culprits responsible for this dangerous fraud.

The problem is, it's just not a funny movie. It's basically what you get when a couple of creators who aren't inherently funny try to make comedy: garish jokes, 8th-grade humor, boobies, and a bunch of instances of shock humor that are meant to get a reaction. Probably an awesome movie if you're either high, or a 14-year-old, and definitely if you're a high 14-year-old, but not for anyone who enjoys great comedy.Watch it so you can say you did, but don't expect to be entertained.

I read in a bunch of reviews that Franco did a bad job on his lines. This is James Franco's best performance since Pineapple Express, and he was hands down the funniest thing about the movie.

OK, maybe not entirely, but one has to wonder, how in the world could this movie be made and whether it deserved this much public attention. You see, this is a story filled with profane and expletive languages, lots of sexual implied scenes, and dumb and dumber plots. The worst part is it makes no sense. Really, it's that bad and not even funny.So here's my one star rating. Some additional thoughts: - Definitely not a family movie, and you'll regret if you watch it with young or old family members. - I respect and like Seth Rogen a lot but his performance is lousy at best in this one. Randall Park, as KJU, performed surprisingly well. Still, it's not some pleasant memory. All the other characters, along with the writers and director, should probably terminate their movie careers and seek new jobs. - I can't stop thinking Sony is a terrible company after this and NK deserves a better punch than this movie.",The Interview

621,b-guihot,"Not the worst, definitely not the best!",6,4 February 2015,"I went into the Interview with high expectations, no double entendre intended. The film which had caused so much controversy and even terrorist threats against those who would show and view the movie left me wondering, why? The film starring James Franco, Seth Rogan and Lizzy Caplan is about an entertainment reporter (Franco) and his editor (Rogan) scoring the interview of a life time with the Leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, during high tensions between America and North Korea over Nuclear Weapons. After obtaining an interview with Kim Jong Un, the pair are contacted by the CIA (Caplan) and asked ever so discreetly to ""Take him out"".We have heard some funny dialogue between the comedy duo of Franco and Rogan over the years and expected the same in this film however Rogan more or less fell to the Sidelines in The Interview Leaving Franco to soak up the spotlight. Franco's brand of crude sexual humour ran rampart throughout, sometimes working, sometimes not so much, however we must accept that it was his acting and timing that has made ""The Interview"" watchable. The film started quite slowly but gained momentum and kept it from the moment the pair left America! With some subtle running jokes, the only intelligent humour the movie had to offer (I love running jokes) and the occasional drug and alcohol binge the film managed to keep its Rogan-esc feel and produced some decent laughs. All though the film does make fun of the Leader of North Korea in many different ways, it also touches on quite a few important political issues between the two countries though, as lightly as you would expect from a comedy.All in all the movie, however insulting to the leader of another country, did not deserve the hype it received in regards to its content. It was funny enough when it needed to be and only rude to another culture in the last 30 minutes or so, leaving me wondering, why was it canceled? I sense a publicity stunt somewhere in the depths. I give the movie 6 out of 10 (a generously bias score from a Rogan- Franco fan) but highly recommend you watch it for your own social benefit as everyone will be talking about it for the next few months whether positive or negative.",The Interview

I also liked the send up of lookalikes especially the lead character Jim Carrey V Zach Galifianakis parody - presuming that was intended.Its satire too - but I suspect the low scorers here share a fear that this is another 2014 /2015 movie framing a one dimensional view of the rest of the non western world The cinematography was pretty good too!",The Interview

Yes, very funny.But more and more, the story became irrationality. A live broadcast to all over the world? Assassinating Kim Jong Un with a tank? Escaping from North Korea by a tunnel? It was a joke and ridiculous The act of 2 main actors were good. Very funny. And I really love the main song of this film: Firework by Katy Perry. Very sensible.

I was watching the film with an open mind thinking that it would humor me and leave me remembering points of interest in the movie, instead silence. watching this film was quieter than a funeral and whats worse was that this film was being hyped as an expression of free speech. No. The performances were your typical Franco and Rogan so expect the same laughs seen in their other films but don't tell me this is a unique comedic masterpiece.

Appreciate that the movie was released and have enjoyed Seth in other movies. The Sony hack added to the publicity value and should wake folks up about their digital privacy but N.

634,aldamayo,between enough and good enough,6,29 December 2014,"I've just seen The Interview yesterday, a film that has generated such buzz and hype and whatnot deriving from the prior hack by a group called Guardians of Peace (GoP in short, which is quite funny) onto the Sony Pictures systems and servers. And I have to say the film does NOT live up to its hype.The film itself championed Seth Rogen and James Franco as the leading duo. Rogen plays basically himself as Aaron Rapaport, a talkshow producer and James Franco plays the host of the talkshow, Dave Skylark. The story starts when Rapaport began to question the banality of his show, which prompts him to consider a change in approach to a more serious one. Alas, they both later learned that Kim Jong-Un, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, is an avid fan of their show, and so they arranged an interview with him in his compound in North Korea. Obviously, the US government is attracted by the idea of having a one-on-one meeting with the (alleged) dictator so they commissioned Aaron and Dave to take out Kim Jong-Un with a secret, Bond-ish weapon.The film pans out to be very predictable, the Rogen-Goldberg comedic formula is all over the place, some led to a number of genuine laughs, some led to nothing, not even a chuckle. The approach taken to the subject of North Korea is very elementary and superficial (Kim Jong-Un lying to his people; people are not fed; nuclear programs) but enough to sustain the interest, just barely. At some points the film did get a little bit humane and sweet, especially during the unlikely bond between Dave and Kim, which is quite endearing to see.Special credit has to be given to Randall Park, who played Kim Jong-Un. He performed admirably in a role that mixed sheer megalomania, boyish charms, and suppressed evil. On the other side of the coin, James Franco's performance is VERY very overacted and over-the-top. To some it might be enjoyable but it's way off for me. But then again, maybe that's how his character was intended to be.All in all, if you like matters involving North Korea, or if you're just interested because of the hacking hype, go see this film. But expect nothing short of a few laughs and a feeling of quasi- accomplishment to have seen this supposedly forbidden film.The Interview is just another screwball, part-satirical comedy that never hits the level it meant to reach. A bland and straight-forward entertainment for the world to see.But maybe that's what made North Korea so mad about the film. It's not good enough.",The Interview

Few elements that I didn't like in the movie, were almost the crudeness of a few jokes, which did not add any value to the script, and could have been done away with.

This is because this movie was in the high risk of never being shown. Everybody was angry with Sony and they wanted to say, they're on the movie's side, they wanted to watch it. So they voted for it even though they hadn't watch it (how could they?). A 10 stars is like: ""We really want to watch it, don't be a coward, Sony, show it to us"". Then finally Sony changed their mind and released the movie despite the threat from hacker. All of this is to say, before you quickly condemn the movie for.. having too high ratings, do your homework.Secondly, don't forget this is a comedy, so stop comparing it with Godfather, Shawhank Redemption, etc... Likewise, don't compare The Walking Dead (8.7) with Silence of the Lambs (8.6)... A comedy is for making you laugh, so if it gives you a good laugh, its good.Now for the review, I give it a 8 because I had really good laugh.

638,y-05119,"Movie Review ""The Interview""",9,22 January 2020,"Movie Review ""The Interview""
The Interview directed by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, is an action-comedy film from Columbia Pictures studios starring James Franco as Dave Skylark and Seth Rogen as his producer Aaron Rapoport. Together, the two run a tabloid television show called ""Skylark Tonight"", where Skylark interviews celebrities. The two learn that Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader of North Korea, is a huge fan of the show and they want to set up an interview. The CIA has come to realization of this matter and they give orders to Skylark and Rapoport that the dictator must be taken out. Throughout the film Rogen and Franco find themselves in peculiar situations and the way they react to them causes the comedic outcomes that makes the film an overall great and action packed comedy.This film shines a light on serious-comedic acting, Rogen, Franco, and other actors throughout the film act as if they're actually in serious business related situations, but the outstanding acting results in the humorous outcomes and reactions. This film does a great job of making dirty and strange jokes so if you don't find those humorous, this wouldn't be the film for you. Randall Park stars as supreme leader Kim Jong Un, his acting plays a key part in the film through his double edged role as the antagonist, through one half of the film. He is seen as nice and respectable at first but as the film progresses he must change personalities towards Skylark and Rapoport, I feel that his acting is very well done and it reflects through how the film turned out. The overall acting in this action-comedy film is the reason why it should receive credit, Franco and Rogen do a well done job overall as the main characters and they show why they remain to be some of the best comedy based actors in film history.
The plot flows nicely through the movie and has a very good ending message but overall I think the most influential part of the film is that the plot interweaves between rags to riches, and overcoming a challenge that the protagonist must face either by an antagonist or situation. The way the plot revolves around them trying to assassinate Kim Jong Un obviously creates this challenge, that is given to them to complete. Along with this challenge comes the emotional pain and obstacles that actors must face throughout the film, together it all creates a suspense in the plot that has viewers wanting to know what happens next. The interesting acts and events that take place throughout this film entail how random but funny this comedy is. The action packed scenes along with the numerous amount of jokes and funny nature even out the seriousness and business part of the film. Although the plot does flow smoothly and has good dialogue and reference, this film at times can seem to be too much or a little on edge with the jokes. The film is for the most place shot in the setting of North Korea and it leads with tiny amounts of false information, but this detail is the reason why the film is so fun to watch and why it relishes in comedy.Overall this film has great value in its own way and the acting and directing deserves a ten out of ten. Franco and Rogen do a good job of creating a duo that dynamically stick with each other through the whole movie. This movie does a great job with creating suspense and it brings a sense of raw emotion that is seen through the well done acting.",The Interview

There are a few (very few) funny lines but, as whole, this move should be shoved down (a hole).This is the biggest pile of crap produced this year. Since this is the end of the year, it is no wonder that this stunt was pulled.The humor was very sparse. The acting was third rate (that is a compliment). The plot was total crap.This should be an embarrassment to the production company. If this is considered even remotely good, this industry is doomed.By all standards, Animal House was a superior movie.Can I get the two hours of my life back?",The Interview
641,bamse000,Seth saves a bit of the movie,5,26 December 2014,"This movie was in first place not in my interests, but all this North Korea issue made me change my mind to watch it. So, what my opinion is about this movie is that it, started with an okay plot, but turned out to be a low quality teen movie, what i expected it to be. The acting style is similar to the movie Knocked up. Seth Rogen saves most of the scenes, but not the movie, who turns to be more a propaganda movie, than a comedy movie. You will get entertainment, but do not expect much. Honestly, all this hacking and threats from North Korea was not worth it! And all this replying threats from the American government was neither worth... this movie is not worth any thing, its a joke.",The Interview
642,almirkuduz,Seth Rogen turned it into garbage,1,31 October 2021,"Honestly, I've been trying so hard to give perhaps four, or at least three or even two stars to this movie but the very split of a second when I see face and especially VOICE of Seth Rogen my best intentions are simply gone. I can not describe strong enough how antipathetic his appearance and, above all, his voice is. WIth voice like a broken thin can, screaming and yelling around, there is no way one can be focused on a movie itself. If you tray even for a second to dive into action and follow this movie there will be that horrible animal like sound coming out of throat of that creature and all of your intentions to watch this movie are simply gone.Seth Rogen is simply someone you don't want to see, not to mention to hear ... ever in your life time.",The Interview
643,ronaldpj,"Bad, really, really bad.",3,27 December 2014,"My first ever review, to warn you. This is a terrible movie and the only reason it is being viewed, is because of all the commotion. That was exactly the reason that I watched it, because otherwise I would probably not have given this movie a second thought.I do enjoy ""over the top"" movies, from time to time, when it is done intelligently, but this was not. Not even close. It is bad, with a capital B.It starts of interesting, with some cameo's, which made me smile (a little), but that was the last time, in the movie. After that it goes from bad to worse. With humor that might be funny to giggling adolescents, because it is funny to joke about poop and pee, but after the next reference to homosexuality or farting, it gets old, very fast.If you catch this review before you view it, don't, I wish I read the reviews before I did, but unfortunately, I didn't.",The Interview
644,nataliarendon-90057,i wanted to find it funny,4,11 December 2020,It's not a BAD film per say. They just over-did it with everything. It was unfunny and loud. Just finished watching it high too and found it pretty unamusing. I usually enjoy movies with Seth and James but this didn't do it for me.,The Interview

646,djagtrem,Lighten up people!!,7,12 February 2021,Not the best comedy but very enjoyable. Seth and James play off each other well with Seth being more of the straight guy. The acting is good and the plot is interesting for what it is....a comedy!!!!,The Interview
647,coolbanditlife,I wanted to see this before all of the Sony hacking cotroversy.,7,27 December 2014,"My First Review EVER! I really enjoyed ""Pineapple Express"" and ""Your Highness"" so as soon as I saw the trailer, I was super excited. I often like movies where I need not get too emotionally involved. This movie seemed to have a few of the things that really interest me like; Asians(particularly women), Making fun of Kim Jong-un who is the dictator of NK and super stupid humor. Over all, it wasn't a bad film. Parts I thought were great and some parts I thought they could have done better. Diana Bang was super sexy as the character Sook which for me, is enough reason to see this film. I wish she was portrayed with a Harder tougher attitude like you would imagine someone in her position would act. Comparing it with other films of James and Seth, I think this measured up fairly well. Maybe it was all the hype or lack of Asian female speaking rolls, but after seeing the film I was slightly disappointed. If you like their other movies you'll probably like this one too.",The Interview
648,sthapa-69865,A good fictional comedy.,8,5 August 2021,"A lot of people are commenting about the political scenario or how unrealistic this movie is and all. But come on, seriously? That is all this movie is about. It has presented a unique story of comedy. Though I am not much a fan of fictional stories this movie is quite entertaining as you go through it. I specially loved the character played by James Franco. This movie is quite funny and can be a break from your other usual dramatic cinemas.",The Interview

652,scottboa-1,Worst Film Ever,1,19 February 2015,"I watched this yesterday. Never mind all the negative press and North Korea's hurt feelings; this movie sucks. Wasted almost 2 hours of my life. A perfect candidate for Ed the Sock's ""This Movie Sucks"" if the Kerzner family ever bring their show back. Remember ""Foul Mouth"" from TV's Tiny Toons? This would make him blush. Instead of killing North Korea's ""Dear Leader"" they decide to humiliate him during their interview with him. And then, at the end of their interview, after they have him ball like a baby, they have him crap his pants. Very poor taste. No wonder the North Korean Government hate this film. My guess is that most viewers will as well.",The Interview

In the footsteps of predecessors like Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, Schindler's List have, The interview is story that will surely become an American Classic.It goes without saying, that this Masterpiece captures the imagination, wit and beauty of cinema. This all begs the question of not if The Interview will be nominated, but just how many awards will it win?If there is one scene that provoke true emotion, and leaves the viewer to weep for joy, it would be the part where the main protagonist ""Kim Jung Un"" is blown up in a fiery ball of blood.",The Interview
654,Rudini,All you have to do is see it,10,19 December 2014,"Watch it and you'll see how amazing it is. Fantastic. I hope everyone will have the pleasure. While other critics maybe slamming it, I do encourage everyone go out and watch it. No spoilers in this review, I can promise you that. It's a silly premise, but when have these two (Rogen and Franco) not made a silly movie?! You can easily see, in the commercial, it's nothing but laughs! Please keep in mind it is a rate R movie, for for pervasive language, crude and sexual humor, nudity, some drug use and bloody violence. But it's a Franco/Rogen movie, what else do you come to expect! I think those are selling points more than negatives. What is this movie you may ask, well it's about two guys Dave (Franco) and Aaron (Rogen), as host and producer for a late night gossip celeb show. Kim Jong-un happens to be a fan of the show, so they get invite to Korea for an exclusive interview. The comedy begins when Dave and Aaron prepare to travel to Pyongyang, their plans change when the CIA recruits them, perhaps the two least-qualified men imaginable, to assassinate Kim Jong-un. Simple, but ridiculous premise! HA!",The Interview
655,james-2695,I honestly feel dumber,2,27 January 2015,"This movie just sucks the intelligence out of you. It is easily Seth Rogan's worst film of all time. I could feel my IQ dropping as I watched the movie. I can't believe I sat through the whole thing. There was not a single laugh out loud moment in the film. It was just horrible. Apparently, I have to write at least ten lines for this to be a review. It is hard to compose thoughts long enough for a review as I have just finished watching this film. The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because I was able to sit through the entire film. The script was awful and the acting was even worse. The fact that they played the Scorpions ""Winds of Change"" at the end of the movie may have ruined that song for me. This is truly two hours of my life that I won't get back.",The Interview
656,kstanb824,Surprisingly Accurate Film,8,29 December 2014,"The way the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un acted towards the end of the movie is exactly the way he acted in real life by trying to block this movie from being released. Spoiled and childish. On the rest of the film, this is a comedy, people tend to judge comedies a lot harsher than they do Dramas. I usually like to judge films within the context of what they are and this movie had some pretty awesome laughs, especially James Franco's facial expressions throughout the movie. The editing room scene towards the end of the movie was as funny as it was gruesome.--May Contain Spoilers--",The Interview
657,ketfoen,A movie for the dumb that just want to be entertained.,8,28 December 2014,"Knowing that I was going to see a Seth Rogan movie, I knew it would have many fart, gay and what not tasteless jokes, but thats why I went to see it. If you want a serious movie, you need to go see a serious movie, if you want an over the top, we don't give a crap what everybody thinks movie, then you go see a Seth Rogan movie.The movie did catch me off guard when they actually killed the supreme leader and it somehow reminded me of Rambo 3, with Stallone in the tank and the Russian leader in the chopper.I give it an 8, because these guys make a movie that no one would even try to make and that shows balls and no brains what's so ever.Next movie maybe they should use a totalitarian American President instead of a foreign one, that would make North Korea happy and maybe even some Americans as well. Freedom of speech and representation with out any thought behind it whatsoever. Just like this review.",The Interview
658,TaliesinTheBard,"Brilliant, hilarious movie ! Spoilers ahead !",10,22 December 2014,"Probably one of the most aesthetically pleasing movies this side of Kubrick; it's full with winks and nods to every past master of cinematography from Spielberg to Hitchcock.The music reminds me of John Williams on crack, with a little touch of James Horner on heroin and Danny Elfman doing E.The plot, well, you may have all already seen this movie a few times and probably bought the Blu-Ray, but there are some nice surprises towards the end. The ""let's rape Kim Jong-Un with a pine cone"" scene doesn't seem forced or contrived, it flows naturally and adds to the hilarity of it all. Maybe revealing that he was an hermaphrodite alien in the end was a little bit too much, and some sensitive people might find that a tad offensive, but considering all the ""your momma"" jokes during the previous half hour, it's a nice change of pace.If you bought the HD edition: watch out for the credits. You might find some nice references to Team America in there.",The Interview
659,malflynn,Unwatchable,1,9 January 2015,"Sony pictures must have self hacked this load of rubbish to get some free press. The writing was the fist thing that strikes you about The Interview, lazy and thick, it seems to have been written for your average ten year old, then the over-acting particularly from Seth Rogen who appeared to be in a spoof of the movie, and not the movie itself. He spent the entire film with a single expression - befuddlement. Perhaps he had an insight into what a disaster this film was from first takes. Then there was the classic Asian chick who really just wants to bang an American, thrown in to titillate your average ten year old, topped off by the totally predictable car chases, explosions, asinine butt jokes and transparent attempts at plot twists. How this steaming pile of excrement got the past studio vetting process is completely beyond me, but if it was star power of Seth, then I feel his days are numbered.",The Interview
660,AlexStefanG,Dumb but funny nonetheless.,7,8 February 2015,"When I heard of it I was like ""I MUST SEE IT"". OK, all that buzz with North Korea, Sony, The Interview, it must be something there and the movie should be gold.Until I saw it. It wasn't boring, It wasn't bad. I enjoyed my time watching The Interview even it was a simple movie without a complex plot, without emotional scenes but I kinda liked it. Why, you may ask? Well, it was kinda dumb. I know a lot of you might agree with me here.You'll hear lots of quotable lines like honeydicked, they hate us cause they ain't' us, they're peanut butter and jelly and more.These will more than likely make their way into everyday language and slang if you speak English on a daily basis.It's a nice movie to watch if you want to be mildly amused but the key here is to not have great expectations because it's not a movie you'll remember like Titanic.I know, it's a stupid comparison but it will help you get the general idea.",The Interview
661,korona1984,Waste of time,1,27 December 2014,"Well, where do we start with this one? Obviously I watched this film knowing what kind of attention had been drawn to it, from crazy Korean hackers, terrorists threatening to bomb theatres to the US president himself. I really hoped that after all the hype it would live up to expectations. And it failed miserably. Cheap humour, jokes and dialogues below criticism most of the time, acting...well, what kind of acting would you expect if the script is not there, the list goes on. Finally, very predictable and flat story, with a major twist easy enough to predict for a 10-year old. But worst of all - the rating. Have you people lost your marbles?! I honestly wanted to give it a 4/10 and before I went on IMDb I was expecting it to be overrated at, say 6/10, but well over 8?! And we're talking over 70 000 votes! This is an insult to cinematography and any intelligent viewer alike that such a piece of garbage should get a score of 8+. It's just unreal. Therefore I'm giving it a 1/10 in a hope that the rating will be quickly brought down to where it actually belongs. It's amazing that only because the film has a political nature, people are willing to rate it so high. Rate it for what it is, don't fool other people into paying to actually see this.",The Interview

My friend said it was good but the IMDb reviews said different but after watching it I can say it isn't as bad as people are making out.Yes, some of the humour is a little bit childish and unfunny but it is mostly funny and enticing. It isn't the best comedy movie I've seen but it's far from the worst.Normally I partly use reviews to decide whether or not to watch a movie but as evidence has proved, this doesn't always work.I'm recommending you watch it, but I'm also saying decide for yourself.",The Interview
663,mikeynl-1,"Terrible script, overacting madness",3,26 December 2014,"After watching this movie, you almost wonder if Sony were not behind the North Korean threats, in order to promote this piece of rubbish. It's a comedy that teenage boy may like, but not many else will. Both actors are totally overacting, especially Franco is very annoying, and the sexual innuendo is terribly adolescent.The plot is cringeworthy at best. A few terrible example? An FBI agent who thinks that the the biggest threat trying to escape North Korea will come from Siberian tigers. The main character who doesn't recognise the name Kim Jung-Ill half way through the movie. The list is endless but fortunately forgot most of the movie.I'm sure that Kim Jung-Il is mostly upset that the film is rubbish.",The Interview

Warning this contains spoilers to every Seth Rogan film ever made.The Interview follows the journey of two bumbling reporters whom the CIA recruit to assassinate Kim Jong Putin. Through a series of funny, somewhat clever and slightly racist interactions the two meet Jong Castro Putin and develop a friendship. At one (several) points they smoke weed and possibly find themselves in an awkward sexual interaction with a daughter/wife/guard/tree. There are some fart jokes, bodily fluids are thrown around and the film ends. There is a loose moral lesson taught likely pertaining to friendship or some other garbage.Despite having not seen this film it has still provided more entertainment than Gravity and Gravity 2: Interstellar Gravity combined.My only complaint is that hackers didn't also prevent the release of The Matrix Online. There's three hours I won't be getting back.",The Interview
665,gsansoucie,Glad this didn't release on Xmas,1,27 January 2015,"This is perhaps the only movie I wanted to watch seeing the trailers and almost convinced my wife to go see it on Xmas. I was so upset when Sony pulled it that I had to see it when it was made available on Netflix this past weekend. After struggling through the worst movie I'd seen in years, all I can say is thank you for NOT showing it on Xmas day, what a huge disappointment that would have been.Perhaps it was all the hype that did it, this movie certainly didn't live up to the hype. I think it could be just an overuse of the childish antics of Rogen and Franco, similar to comedy figures of the past who were paid to perform stupid antics in front of the camera, this movie pretty much did in that duo for me, I believe I'm done with them for now.All the jokes (if you can call them jokes) are predictable, they seem to expect a ton of laughs from all the potty humor which really didn't do it for me. If you are reading the reviews to determine whether you should watch the movie, take my word for it and don't waste your time here, move on along...",The Interview

But after I suffered through that, I was truly entertained. Several times I laughed hard enough to bring tears. At one point, I mistimed a sip of my beverage at one of the funnier lines and spewed from both nostrils. If that description is too graphic for you, you'd be better off not watching. Mr. Park was the surprise of the movie. He was hilarious as the ""supreme leader"", Kim something Un. But he didn't quite match the real dictator's goofy looks. He makes that moron look way better than he really is. I liked about half of the soundtrack. I'm just not hip enough, or young enough, to care for anything in the ""rap"" category. I'm thinking ages 18-32 will rate it a 10. I doubt anyone over 40(me) will.",The Interview

Not to realistic but not to goofy either, a sweet spot in the middle. Not sure if spoilers but *SPOILERS*, i felt that the ending lacked allot of the comedy that was very present throughout the whole movie, specially in the ""actual interview"" our mail lead (James Franco) defeats ""The dear leader"" in a pretty silly way, and then follows to switch his tactics, from a moral and political victory, to an all out action packed scene with an extremely unrealistic ending.All in all, it was a controversial movie done in a tasteful way. 8/10",The Interview

Spider-Man)I guess satire is a cult-thing, a thing 'normal' people just don't get. If you don't like it, then you're not the target demographic. Rogen and Franco make movies they would both enjoy, and that sums up their demographic. Why wouldn't you make a movie just for the sake of entertaining yourselves? People will like it, as 'Pineapple Express' and 'This Is The End' proved.Turn of all sense of logic, reason and criticism and just lay back and watch the movie.

These two could do a film with a story line about anything and still have a hilarious outcome. Yes the humour is specific towards people who generally enjoy good slap stick humour and weed. Yet people seem to think watching paint dry is better? These people are the sort who need to check their health and find friends to be able to enjoy these types of movies. You can't use the excuse that this movie wasn't entertaining because of its cliché scenes and boring storyline because that was the whole point. This movie is highly unrealistic and completely politically inaccurate, yet revels its portrayal of these volatile themes and the rocky relationship between Aaron, Dave and Kim! And if you can't enjoy that then stop taking everything so seriously, you drags. Take some time to gather close friends and sticky green or whatever it is that soothes you, and enjoy the only hysterically funny perspective of North Korea you will see for ages.",The Interview

It is the same old stuff with Seth going ""oh my god, oh my god"" mostly.Maybe it is just me, but I'm sick of these movies now. Seems like the same old crap churned out.I'm pretty sure it was the studio that hacked itself to get some PR and hopefully fill some seats in the theaters.You would be better served giving the 8 bucks to a random stranger on the streets then suffer through this huge steaming pile of s**t.",The Interview

Good ONLY to spread the topic and for the political and Sony Hack controversy!,4,25 December 2014,"The good in this is that Kim Jong Un actually likes basketball, he cuts his own hair and well, it's kind of funny to watch that and other invented stuff of him in this movie. In addition, according to Wikipedia among 300,000 and 800,000 North Koreans died annually from 1995 for malnutrition illness. There is a lot of people who doesn't know any of this, so this is cool, to share this information.The movie itself has some funny moments, actually its so much better that other American comedies like this is the end or the last ones of scary movie. But in general it could make you laugh if you like this kind of genre. Very unrealistic and stupid some times with poor special effects in fight scenes.Nonetheless It will probably get you sited on watching till the end.",The Interview
674,glass12-840-727633,Clever move Sony....,4,30 December 2014,This is the worst movie i've saw this year. The topic of North Korea im sure is something Hollywood has played with more and more (think latest Red Dawn) but yet struggles to truly make them out to be bad guys as they don't have the real life fear factor to be taken seriously. Diana Bang attempts at North Korean does pass as plausible and is some good eye candy for the movie Yes some funny gag's in it but keep this up and Seth Rogen will endanger his career and start churning out 3rd rate films like Adam Sandler. Id have hated to pay cinema prices to have seen this film. My advice is to wait for local TV showings. James Franco and Seth Rogen are gonna have to pull the rabbit out of the hat for the next one or i see them losing all credibility for their writing and acting skills!,The Interview
675,DinoTheGreek,Let down,3,3 January 2015,"Actually the first half of the movie was way better than the second one. It gets you a bit excited of what is going to happen and then it gets worse way until the end. The acting was not the worse part, nor the idea of the movie. But the story as a whole was pretty bad. It's no where near movies like ""Hot Shots"" or ""Top Secret"" that I watched as a kid and I still watch them after so many times. That's why I disagree when people say it's targeted to younger audience. Definitely no. I understand when a movie is not suitable for my age and when a movie is just bad. I was expecting something better, considering all the fuss, but not to much to be honest. Beside 3 or 4 funny lines, the ""Interview"" was a disaster. The story and the screenplay were dull. It seemed rushed or like they didn't try enough and this is disappointing. No actor could support a movie like this. It is just unfunny.",The Interview

The comedy provided throughout would make any sensible person laugh. I like how Rogen and Franco work together - they always build in good content that engages the audience and this movie is the same way. They both have a knack for edgy comedy. We would not be talking about it if they did not. I hope that they get nominated for an Oscar because they definitely deserve it. Once they get nominated for an Oscar, I hope that they win it and I bet all 26K+ of you agree with this too. How could they not win?

Okay, I don't like DPRK though, but after I watched it, I felt bad because of the double standard of U.S. If you leave a comment like ""is about to kill somebody"", you will be tracked or be caught by FBI in the US, and then put you in prison, but if you leave a comment or even make a movie to kill other country's leader, it's definitely okay or it's even awesome. In a word, it's not a movie or a comedy, but just a propaganda. It is not a constructive way to solve any problem, and it will potentially cause the problem with other country. That's why I gave 2/10 to ""The Interview"".",The Interview

Franco and Rogen were funny, the story was good, there was a lot of good action and everything fit together nicely. Yes, maybe slightly formulaic but let's face it, to be a Hollywood hit EVERYTHING must reach the maximum audience for the longest amount of time possible at the least cost. I have a feeling this film will do very well in the end. The only reason this film is missing a star is that Franco is a good actor and I'm sure is now a contender for the ""6 degrees of (Kevin Bacon)"" game but was not in my opinion, incredibly believable as a popular news show host. Sorry James. Seth Rogen was Seth Rogen but I felt possibly his best Seth Rogen in this film. Haters gonna hate, but why? This is a good movie!!",The Interview

For example, Pineapple Express was a huge hit, great movie, laughed my ass of. Secondly, this movie has had a huge buzz around it, due to the hacking claims. I do not understand why, team America was 10 times more hardcore.After downloading and watching The Interview, i am glad i did not go to the cinema and payed for a ticket. James Franco is funny, but for like the first 5 minutes. For Seth Rogen, i can not remember any well funny part in the movie.

You can watch it more than 10 times in a year and never be sick of it! Sounds impossible but Jim Carrey has made films like that.",The Interview

Maybe it's just teenagers who want to over-rate this movie for fun, and i don't see the point. Like i don't see the point of this movie.. I mean i do like comedy and i really like Seth Rogen, but here it's the same (i'm sorry for that) rehash sh*t. Again and again and again racist-poop-alcohol-sexist-non funny jokes.. Haven't we seen this before ? Oh yeah that's right : Neighbors and It's the end. And above all : i really liked those 2 movies, but i found The Interview over- rehash and not funny at all. And what about James Franco ? What happened to him ? He's over-acting during the entire movie, and it drove me nuts as hell !!! Can't stop screaming when he talks, and i don't understand why does everybody laugh thanks to him in this movie... What a giant earthquake for weeks just for this waste of money and time.",The Interview
682,juke-35-701017,Home run.,9,27 December 2014,"Those guys hit it out of the park with this one. They show how incredibly comically idiotic and at the same time horribly brutal those who hold global power and those who desire it can be. They spare no one including the CIA, broadcast media, pop culture, the Hollywood elite, and the music business. The media figures they send up get on board totally and show a great sense of humor about themselves. They did a great job with special effects and the film is well shot. If I had to criticize anything it would be the lapses in the North Korean security that allow the plot to move forward but really who cares, this is a fun comedy so we can let that slide. Any more detail would make me a spoiler, but I will say it was the best $6 I have spent in months. Just see it.",The Interview

Well never mind, thank the fates I did not pay to see it. YOU SHOULD NOT WASTE THE TIME OR MONEY EITHER. No need to feign that there is even a shred of a redeeming factor to discuss in terms of cinematic quality, acting skill, scriptwriting, comedic shtick, etc. It bears nonesuch because there was none in evidence, and even when a glimmer of hope that it might present such arrived, it disappointed. I have seen some reviewers compare this to slapstick comedy like Benny Hill, The Three Stooges etc. That would be a deep insult to those fine and well-honed comedians' timing, skill and creativity.If you want to test a similar experience? Maybe go watch a large dog taking a bowel movement in the park: if you found that funny, then The Interview is right up your alley.",The Interview
684,hullfc1,Most Hyped film ever,3,26 December 2014,"Someone at Sony must have thought, what can I do to save this film from the bin, trashcan? They must be an executive now for pulling off a major hype that basically is more entertaining then this film ever could have been.Ignoring what truly is a dismal film, James Franco's acting and portrayal of Dave Skylark is excellent. Its just so disappointing that the storyline wasn't able to support his performance. I'm not condoning terrorism or making light of such an act, but if indeed the Korean's have made such threats, then they should have just watched the film and then they would have known that it would have 'bombed' without publicity to hype it.Truly a film not to kick yourself for missing",The Interview

However, as the story unfolded into something different, something most unexpected I found myself thrilled. As a lifelong lover of films, I think about comedy as the very nature of ground breaking feature films. When watching, think Robin Williams, Bill Murray, Billy Crystal, Eddie Murphy, Lena DunhamAnyway, the film is a real eye opener for those whom can't bother to read or watch the news. Think of 24 million people without access to informed choice, 16 million without enough to eat. Well done film.",The Interview

Yes I smiled sometimes, but that's it. The whole movie is just to put the president of NK to a low level, stupid, childish, and that is all about him. At first I thought the movie may have a great point about the Media, that these days we are often led by the media, listen to whatever they feed us, and this year some movies also took this subject as the main point (gone girl, Night Crawler). But I was wrong. Still we will love the media at the end of the movie, still hail them as hero.Despite those facts, the movie also has nudity and bloody scene, which I also should warned and also find it non-sense anyway. If you really want to spend your time more meaningful, do not watch this, it's just a phenomenon, 4 stars is enough for it.",The Interview
687,pablo1587-106-107083,Thank you North Korea for the for giving free publicity to a okay comedy,7,28 December 2014,"I have to take my hat off to Sony, Seth Rogen, and Evan Goldberg. They have received free publicity to an OK comedy. Do not get me wrong. This whole stunt was to be expected. Rogen and Goldberg have taken the risk of making a movie that satirizes a current totalitarian regime. North Korea (NK) took the bait, hook-line and sinker. NK reacted with pretty strong words, national media covered the story, and in turn it made people curious about a movie that would've faired okay in the theaters.I must confess that I'm not a Rogen or Franco fan; but I was one of those curious enough who decided to give this movie a chance. That said, if you go and watch this movie without any expectations, you might very well enjoy it.The movie had the potential to become a true political satire for the ages, ie. ""Dr. Strangelove: or How I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb""; but the script is what limited this movie to really stand out. It should have stopped focusing on the sexual innuendo (typical of a Rogen and Franco movie), and instead focus and dwell on the relationship built by Mr. Francos character and the Kim Jong-un caricature. That would have really been the moneymaker and it would have, in my opinion, established this movie as a new satirical classic for the ages.All this said, I still recommend this movie. It the entertainment category, it delivered. It made me laugh. So I would recommend it to anybody that wants to invest two hours to relax and laugh a little.",The Interview
688,alfalfaville,Not as bad as I expected,7,5 February 2015,"SPOILER ALERT!And I was worried especially when Seth Rogan hid the capsule up his ***e. I mean that it would be another ""Dumb and Dumber"" or an ""Anchorman 3"". But the movie had me at hello, with ""die America"" sung by the little girl. Worth the price of admission, which for me on Netflix was not much. The violence from biting and shooting is well done and a bit too realistic, so kudos for special effects. I'd have written the film differently, had the Kim Jung Il character be a double for the real guy or something such. The sexy CIA agent Lizzy Caplan and her method of assassination was ludicrous, but that's the point! It's not Scorcese, not Alex Jones, not even Bill Maher, who has a cameo. Snobs such as the gentleman reviewer from the Netherlands need to unwind. Was he expecting ""Lawrence of North Korea""? Pure escapism, Canada doubling as North Korea, witty and better than 90 percent of US comedies. Worth a 2nd watch and the Korean cast is especially excellent. Kudos to the real North Koreans for boosting the popularity of the film by their buffoonish hacking.",The Interview
689,Behelit,Wasted potential,5,24 June 2015,"The film's premise was really original, and it raised the challenge of a witty ending that's on par with it, to make the film a little memorable. Unfortunately they didn't do it and delivered the same old lazy super exaggerated all-out gun fest with lots of blood, explosions and stupid punchlines that so many other forgettable comedies have for an ending.Watching this film was like eating too much chocolate. At first it tastes and feels great, then you keep eating even though you are feeling guilty, then your stomach starts to ache, and finally you get really sick and regret it all.",The Interview
690,johnsellman,Wonderful,10,22 December 2014,"What a wonderful movie. The plot is great, the writing is great, it's funny, sad and runs the full gamut of emotions. The scenery is impeccable. I hope this team can do other satirical movies focusing on the timely deaths of cruel and inhumane egotistical rulers of other countries in the near future. I think this could be a yearly occasion to coincide with the holidays. Why not, there are enough of these guys around the world so the trend could go on for years. Who's with me? Or we could really anger North Korea and do an ""Interview"" with the leader who follows up this one, Why not? IT's just for fun right? Hat's off to the creators, actors and crew. My new holiday favorite.",The Interview
691,seg9585,Review From Someone Who Actually Saw the Movie,5,22 December 2014,"I saw The Interview in a screening around April 2014. This was an in-production screening so much of the music and graphics were not yet complete, but the filming/sequencing/editing was complete.It's honestly just another ridiculous Seth Rogen comedy. Rogen and Franco are portrayed as American idiots who can't do anything right, much less pull off an assassination attempt on Kim Jung Un when they are tasked to do so after scoring an exclusive interview with Franco (for whom the North Koreans are huge fans).They fly to NK and get pampered by Kim Jong Un and his generals. Several times the Americans get ""ready"" to pull off the assassination but keep making mistakes (such as losing their assassination ""device"", or almost killing themselves in the process) to the frustration of the CIA.Eventually a ""senior official"" of Kim Jung Un's finds out what they're up to and agree to help with the assassination attempt. This leads to a series of ridiculous action scenes and random buildings getting blown up, Rogen/Franco driving a tank in an attempt to escape NK, and Un himself leading a an attempt to stop the Americans from escaping.If this movie didn't stir up so much real-life political controversy, basically no one would be talking about it a day after walking out of theaters.",The Interview

You have to force yourself with watching the first portion of the movie until you even get to the point that they even get to the Korea bit, and then it just spirals downwards.during that first portion you beg for the movie to pick up and when it doesn't I just gave up, and hopefully so would you. Honestly, I have no idea why North Korea got so annoyed, this movie is a joke! and not a funny one... I think that if people would have paid money for this movie they would burn down the movie theater themselves, no need to even try and send a bomb all the way from North Korea.",The Interview

I loved Rogen and Francos pairing,they should do more movies together. I quite enjoyed this movie and yes..I could have done without all the over the top innuendos and the scene after the tiger,but over all I thought the cast did a great job with what they had. The film is no Oscar winner but James Franco is definitely a firework! I thought Franco did an amazing job with The Interview and even though I probably won't recommend it to my parents, I still would say it's worth a watch especially if you are a Rogen and Franco fan.

That is what Seth Rogen and James Franco are known for! Turn off your brain, relax, and just laugh for a couple hours...it will do you good!

You are left with one emotion you haven't felt since you first ate a bag of pistachios without finding a single seed being uncracked. Jubilation. This is how it feels to watch The Interview.

The writing is so out of touch with what is cool. Constant use of played out slang. Every sentence an f bomb. I am embarrassed that they couldn't have made a more clever movie to insult Korea. Could've been funny, opportunity wasted. James Franco needs to distance himself from Rogaine or his career will spiral. I can see why they needed a master media gag to get this brick to float.i can imagine the PR team for this after watching the movie.

Thank God I couldn't from outside the US. It seems that it was all hoax. I'm truly disappointed. The movie was so cheap and vulgar. I barely laughed at all. The humor was primitive and childish. So unfortunate. No wonder the rating has dropped drastically during the last few days. Don't get your hopes up. It's definitely not worth the money or your time!

The great leader of North Korea cannot stop this train now, for he cannot compare to Walter White, the best hero and character to grace televisions screens around the globe. Perfectly written, this film rivals that of some of the greatest writers of our time. Vince Gilligan simply cannot stand toe-to-toe with such extraordinary writers. Beautifully shot and gracefully directed, this film puts some of the greatest cinema to shame. More shameful yet, this even tops Hans Zimmers Interstellar score, as being among one of the best this year of our lord, 2014, neigh all time.

The film starts slow with many jokes missing their mark, a few of which being over the top Lord of the Rings references. When I thought all was lost for this movie it took a turn for the better, switching plots lines from what was expected, and adding some genuinely funny parts to make this movie a solid comedy you could spend an afternoon on. The team of Rogen and Goldberg will draw me in again, simply because ""This Is the End"" was an enjoyable experience, and ""The Interview"" was a pleasant surprise.6.2/10",The Interview

But i was wrong and it was awesome. Except a couple of times the story was fluid, not very well made but who cares because there is time to analyze the story. The fast paced events are really well designed if you ask me. And for the best part to me; not like many comedy movies with events made especially stupid so it will be funny, in this movie events are designed really good and for crying out loud there are really few stupid events but they even designed events to turn something different.(Somebody actually realized the tank can fire for crying out loud) Also i have to prise Franco in here especially at some scenes i really felt like i am watching Skylark instead of Franco. The evolve of skylark was actually really good to. Well this is basically it. İ enjoyed my well spent time and i am satisfied.

With gratuitous, out-of-place sexual innuendos, excessive homosexuality jokes, and some of the worst attempts at dry humor I've seen in years, this movie does not deliver any of the comedy I had been expecting.James Franco's character, Dave Skylark, was perhaps one of the most unnatural roles he could have played. More genuine acting could have been found in a 1980's amateur porno.This movie would likely have fared far worse had it gone into theaters like a normal movie-- the ""hackers"" that attacked Sony did them a favor. This movie would not have had any notoriety at all if it wasn't for the obvious publicity stunt that was pulled right before its launch.Do you want to see a fast-paced, witty, and overall intelligent comedy that actually leaves you feeling like you didn't waste nearly two hours of your time?Then don't watch The Interview.",The Interview

It is a criminal waste of great opportunity to take an excellent comedy film and take a jibe at the regime.

You just wasted the time to see this movie, Dave try to act like Jim Carry but it's not funny at all. It bored me to death and couldn't not have been a whole lot worse than what it was.

Anyone that writes a review that is ""great, awesome, amazing"", was either paid to say it or didn't see it. This had to be the biggest PR stunt in history for the movie to get as much hype as it has over the past few weeks. Even Howard Stern said ""these guys couldn't buy this much press for this film"". Good thing it did, because Sony must have cut all funding for the advertising as it is a piece of crap.This might be one of the biggest flops this side of Istar, which I did not see, but still had as much hype attached to it as this film does (did). Don't get sucked into the hype machine this film isn't worth it unless you find Rogen and Franco funny for some reason. I kinda' laughed one time, but can't remember at what now as the movie was that bad.Do yourself a favor, wait until someone you know pays to download the movie and loan it to you as you will still feel ripped off after having spent nearly 2 hours wondering what all the hype was about. And you know that the studios and the actors are going to read these and say the ""reviews were great"", but this one isn't as the movie itself sucked. Hope Sony makes some of the money back they paid for this piece of crap, betting they won't be making anymore movies with these guys again. As for spoiler alerts?

But in the end, Team America is just a satire movie no more no less.Now get back to subject that have been shook up the whole world in the late 2014. The Interview is a predictable movie about friendship between Dave Skylark, played wonderfully by James Franco (who had a bizarre career) and Aaron Rapaport, played by Seth Rogen go to North Korea to take Kim Jong-un out.

712,mallesw3,Great!,8,25 December 2014,"Alright. Disregarding all the drama, controversy this movie has been getting, this is a very solid comedy flick, in my opinion. The humor is just like any other Seth Rogen-flick, so as someone who really appreciates his other movies, this sat right with me. The plot is not exactly complicated. A dumb late-night TV-show presenter (James Franco)and his slightly more rational producer (Seth Rogen) land an interview with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un (played by Randall Park). Pretty entertaining premise, so i went in with high hopes and it sure delivered.The plot is pretty ridiculous and silly, and i didn't want or expect anything else. The chemistry between Rogen and Franco is just a wonderful thing to see, and Randall Park does a great job as Kim Jong-Un. I personally laughed through most of the movie. The movie is funny, well written, well made, very entertaining and overall a hilarious parody and satirization of North Korea, Celebrity culture etc.One thing this movie absolutely got right is the cinematography and visuals. God damn, this movie is beautifully shot. I was actually kind of blown away. Well lit, professional settings and props, good cuts and camera angles. Props to Brandon Trost and all the other people who worked with the cinematography, as well as the location scouts.A 7.5 for me personally, but i'll round it up since i really appreciated the cinematography.",The Interview
713,afterhourspc,Just not worth all the hype - Typical Franko and Rogan,2,30 December 2014,"So of course you have to be living under a rock to not know about the whole ordeal with the movie The Interview. I took my teenage son with me to see it tonight and was not surprised at all -> total crap. At least in our view (son thought it was stupid as well) Franko and Rogan continue a slow and painful descent into cash cow rape of the movie going public.We went and saw it at the local small town theater in support for them because Sony required that the independent theaters pay $2500 up front in order to have it available. Then Sony did the bullshit move they did and offered those 6 hours for free before making folks pay for it. I think that it is great that this could be some type of breakthrough in streaming first run releasing however I for one have gained no more respect for Sony. I have not had respect for them for years as it is however from the standpoint of having a friend who is struggling to keep a local 4 cinema theater open I can see how they once again are being total douches.That being said I really can't see why Sony even fronted their nameplate to this film. I am still totally perplexed as to how so many folks enjoyed This Is The End, but to each their own I guess. I suppose that you could say, ""well what did you expect???"".

My Opinion: the interview has an amazing plot amazing actors of course the jokes and humour are unbearable at times you definitely won't disagree unless your humour is at a all time low this movie is hilarious if you like comedies you will love this I couldn't stop laughing through most of it.

The idiot Skylark suddenly turns out to be a super reporter, and the evil North Korean leader turns out to be human after all. There is not a single redeeming feature about this movie - other than the artificially generated publicity, of course.

He grabs themes that are known and appealing to the audience and just creates a silly dumbass movie, the thing is... it's so idiotic that i love it.Let me tell you this: -You are NOT going to see one of the best comedies ever. -The movie theme is interesting and appealing, but ALWAYS simple and dumb. -It's full of sex jokes, some violence and even some times Lord of the Rings references. -Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen as always. -James Franco is TOO FAR from an Oscar nomination, his acting is very silly and dumb, besides, he makes it look very forced sometimes. -The actor who portrayed Kim Jong-Un is WAY too handsome compared to his real version. -The cameos from other actors in the movie are VERY well done, just like in This Is The End. -Don't expect ANY smart jokes.So, after all that, i'm going to end this review with these words: IF YOU LAUGH WHEN SOMEONE FARTS OR TELLS A DICK JOKE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A VERY GOOD TIME WATCHING THIS FILM.",The Interview

This journey has never been so beautifully captured as it is in this movie. Am I saying Seth Rogen is the greatest filmmaker of all time...Yes! Not only is the dialogue magnificently crafted but the cinematography crafts a mood that appreciates all life and makes you feels as if their is some good left in the world. Seth Rogen has earned himself a spot alongside the three big S's in film. (S)teven (S)pielberg , (S)tanley Kubrick, Martin (S)corsese , and now (S)eth Rogen. This film will be nominated for every Oscar including best foreign film, best animated short, and best documentary. Its that good.",The Interview
718,ibanez83,Another 5 out of 10 movie. Nothing special...,5,24 December 2014,"This movie is simply nothing special. I give it a 5 out of 10. It entertained me, and bored me at times. The plot is predictable. I've read some reviews here and I honestly don't understand how people find it so funny. I didn't laughed out loud even once... I did chuckle though, but that was it. I believe many people wrote reviews here without actually watching the movie. This movie is NOT a 9 (as is the rating right now). This movie is NOT better than The Godfather as to have such rating!!! I think Seth Rogen could do much better stuff than this. The actors are all OK, no big interpretations or something like that. In conclusion; this is not an special movie at all... 5 STARTS!!!",The Interview
719,jared-a-friske,Eminem's scene in the beginning of the movie was by far the best part...,6,27 December 2014,"After all the hype surrounding this movie before its release, I expected it to be offensive and because of that, funny. The ""controversy"" that came along with this movie now seems absolutely absurd after actually watching it. I'm actually quite shocked that Sony initially decided to cancel it because of how tame this movie is. It had its funny moments, but not nearly enough of them, and a lot of them seemed forced. Acting was bad even for Seth and Franco. Eminem's scene was by far the highlight of the movie. Slightly above-average comedy film on par with ""Semi-Pro"", ""Beerfest"", and ""Hot Tub Time Machine"". I can't help but think the cancellation thing was just a big ploy for Sony to get people to talk about it and help get everyone and their mother to watch the movie. It's a shame people who initially didn't even watch the movie rated it 10/10 on here before it was even released.",The Interview

This is a real insult to any Cinephile intelligence. One thing I couldn't understand though, how come this movie was rated 6.9 on IMDb scale ??? breathtakingly Chocking to rate that high a stupidly humourless, unexciting, dumb movie like this one, the worst film I've seen in years. The Interview is a bad, ugly and ridiculously stupid movie that as I said trivialises and insults the fantastic world of comedy all around the world.",The Interview
721,mark-585-429508,What does North Korea have to be afraid of?,2,26 December 2014,"The film that could not be seen, has been now been seen and here are the thoughts I'm left with:It's basically a frat-house take on 'Frost Nixon' and like most frat-house fare it's never as funny as it seems to be for those making the film. All the usual 'Judd-Apatow/The-Hangover' tick boxes are disappointingly in place: race jokes, women jokes, sex jokes, dick jokes, fart jokes but yet none of them with the necessary amount of irony that might successfully sell any of them.So what are you actually left with? Occasional nice cinematography and production design and a nagging question as to why James Franco is so intent on sabotaging his career / talent? Seth Rogen wisely plays the straighter of the two leads, and does so in a way that actually makes you wonder how good he could be in a straight role (-I suspect, pretty good).So if North Koreans were genuinely worried about this film they needn't have been, nor should they have hacked into Sony Pictures USA. America is the real loser here with a blunt, cultural missive that ends up detonating its own culture rather than that of its intended target - North Korea. Dr Strangelove this isn't, but then that said, how could it have ever been?",The Interview

Jokes on a level, where it is not more possible to go deeper in addition to a stupid storyline.Now I know that all this hype was just a nice marketing tactic from SONY. I guess the studio needs a success story and so they try to hype a movie which is not worth to watch. Without these tactic maybe no one would like to see, but now everyone wants to watch. Nice try, the whole world speaks about this movie. But be afraid, this is no reason to watch...",The Interview
723,rpb925,Awful,2,10 June 2015,"I like the idea of the movie and had potential but it really is a flop. I felt as if I should have been paid to watch it not the other way around. I wish it wasn't so but it is boring, lacks any sort of wit and acting is average at best. Movie is superficial predictable nonsense that is commonly seen in American comedies however given it had high ratings and endorsed by the President of America himself I thought it might have broken the mold at some point but to no avail. I also saw Seth Rogen speak about the movie during a TV interview and he spoke humbly about it and the fanfare it had and he seemed like a real genuine guy and I like the way he presented the movie and himself. Please make your next movie a good one so I can like you for more than just being a nice guy.",The Interview

When thirty minutes passed, I knew I was witnessing a true cinematic masterpiece: one that would be discussed for generations to come. When the final scene had ended, I felt a grand satisfaction that I had never felt before, and will likely never feel again. The Interview is objectively the most wonderful and beautiful film ever, and I don't see it being beaten- ever. During the film, I often thought to myself, ""wow. What a movie. This is up there with The Godfather, Citizen Kane..."" but those thoughts didn't last for long; The Interview is in another league- a league of its own, Miles ahead of what we had once considered ""great cinema"". Perhaps, light-years ahead. Brandon Trost establishes himself as one of the greats in cinematography, and with the remarkable direction of Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, this film contains shots that rival Kubrick's. This film ought to win the Oscar for greatest film of all time, previously held by SpaceJam (Michael Jordan R.I.P.). The complex issues and social commentary effortlessly weaved throughout the film will shed new light onto the human psyche. James Franco.

726,akhiok,The celebration of stupidity,2,28 December 2014,"Let's be honest, the humor presented in this movie is what I consider the Celebration of Stupidity. If you enjoy, juvenile, off-color, racist humor without a clear sense of satire, then you'll love this movie. ( This movie was a failed attempt at satire. I imagine the writers don't have the necessary skills. )If you don't like base, juvenile humor, you've been persuaded by current events to watch this film or at least read some reviews. If you don't need to spend time watching this movie so you can join into water-cooler discussions to advance your career, I recommend looking for another job and avoiding people who stay.If you enjoy this humor, it's going to be a great movie that you can laugh through and come out having learned very little except how to make fun of people.This writers are witty with belittling humor.

The director clearly did not understand any aspect of Korean culture, Kim did not look like Kim at all and he couldn't even speak proper Korean! This is the DUMBEST movie out there guys. My South Korean friends all hated this and they felt that they were made fun of. If an equivalent movie like this was focused on the US, it would be like this: Everyone is fat. Everyone wears cowboy hats and yells 'God Bless Texas!'. We call them Yanks. They speak sloppy English in the English accent For some reason, many people are aware of K-pop and Obama seems to like it. Apparently, it was easy to 'hang out' with the ministers and the president for no reason. The ridiculousness can go on and on!",The Interview

James Franco did the worst role I've ever seen. After 20 min i was already tired of his role, it was too fake and overacting. Seth Rogen did a good part, even though the movie is so bad. I'm a little mad with the reviewers, that says James Franco was the best and don't give any credit to Seth, after read them i realize James Franco is so overrated. Im amaze with the rating you guy are give to it, really a 7? even we love this guys we have to be fare, this movie is a CRAP, if i could give no star, i will.

Sadly I'm not one of those writers who knows how to balance those two concepts so I'm not sure how to fix it.I wouldn't shell out cash for it but if you get a chance to see it without wasting money it's worth it to form your own opinion.",The Interview

The way Kim Jong-un died in the show was Funny. When there is another Screening for this i'll go again. There were a few parts that was like ugh come on but over all i enjoyed the film. I'm sure NorthKorea is not going to attack the USA over a movie just look at all the other movies killing people and now he thinks this movie is going to war over.When the other place's do decide to show the movie i think a lot of people will enjoy it as much as we all did.,The Interview

Definitely worth watching/paying for if you like these comedies. I'll admit Im almost annoyed by Seth Rogens identical character in every movie by now but id watch it just for Franco's part. The final scene is hilarious with a great slow-mo sequence (said no one ever). There's a lot of bashing on North Korea, but definitely thought there would have been more and even worse.Not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from, either grumpy old people or a North Korean hack into IMDb accounts.",The Interview

735,ainez-liu,Why the hate? Exactly what to be expected,7,4 January 2015,"After hearing so much hype about The Interview, along with all the reviews about it being a crude, tasteless disaster, I watched the movie for myself online, and could only disagree with what I've heard and read so far on IMDb.The Interview is exactly what you'd expect from a Seth Rogan and James Franco comedy- better even, I thought this surpassed This is the End by far and is definitely on par with the classic Rogan titles. Filled to the rim with clusters of cameos, jokes and swearing, it was exactly the fun, vulgar comedy that the trailer advertised it to be. Franco's acting was on point in this film, with many of his lines delivered perfectly to trigger extensive laughing, as it was a combination of his goofy, aloof persona and punchy writing. Undoubtedly, the humor wasn't deeply layered or complex but rather absurd and based very much on blunt, childish, and what many would call stupid, verbal exchanges, but this very much well captures the foreign and ridiculous nature of North Korea itself, and thus encapsulates the entire film to excel right in the satirical genre. The minimum of a movie, aimed to be taken seriously as a comedy, is to entertain and if one was to review this title on such measure, The Interview is thoroughly entertaining and is worth a watch if you're in the mood for a satirical comedy executed with incredible chemistry between the leads.",The Interview

738,jwhite3321-847-64234,The Hate us Cause they Ain't US!!,7,25 December 2014,"The Interview is not a movie ever meant to take itself seriously. A world where a journalist wants to do real news stories. The movie is over of the top, and completely implausible. None the less, the movie is fun, as it just makes fun of itself and North Korea.Seth Rogen directs a pretty straight forward film about the US and its need for fluffy news and non-news news broadcaster. James Franco takes on the role of self adsorbed celebrity TV personality trying to placate his best friend with the biggest news interview of the 21st century. Enter in celebrity cameos showing disdain for Dave Skylark and his shotty news show. The CIA wants to try to dictate the outcome with a change of leadership convince the dynamic duo to assassinate Kim Jong Un. The movie has its over the top moments, and some parts can be slow but it is a movie to laugh at and with it.Everybody has something that chews them up and, for me, that thing was always loneliness.

Kim Jong Un was made to look like more of a goof-ball than a menace and the two main characters constantly messed up which in my opinion was hilarious. With that being said i'd highly recommend this movie if you've watched and liked Superbad, Pineapple Express, and several other of Seth Rogen's movies. If you don't like these kinds of movies then don't even bother watching you'll probably think it was a waste of time. However, if your curiosity gets the best of you and you watch it anyway and don't enjoy it because of it's themes and/or you despise the genre please don't be that guy that posts an angry review about how much they hated the movie, it really makes you look like @##, because it's easy to tell that you didn't like it before you even watched it.",The Interview

I just rented and watched The Interview and truly feel like it is one of the top ten moments I've felt very patriotic! I had been making plans to see this since this summer. Told my brothers and sisters that in October, we were going to watch this new Rogen/Franco movie. Disappointed but amused at the move of it's release date to December. Damn near heartbroken when I heard of the cancellation of the release! I was really really wanting to see this Dec 25th in theaters. Got the next best thing sitting at my kitchen table! So happy right now! The movie is really good. It is a comedy thats very well written. The actors do amazing jobs. It's a top notch production. Some reviewers have said that it doesn't live up to the hype. Personally, This Is The End is one of my favorite comedies. If this movie would've had Danny Mcbride maybe? Lol I would say that N. Korea overacted to some silly Americans which is what most of us are honestly. Simple, fun loving Americans ;p Im giving this 10 stars because I do believe it is a 8-9 star comedy but really just wanna give it a lil more push. Would you really not watch a movie because it was an 8 instead of a 10? Sorry, Super Critic Man, but it's definitely worth seeing. Randall Park as UN is truly what makes this movie memorable.

I never thought he could be this pretentious before and his performance in this movie, mainly the first half, is so hyperbolic, frivolous, and ostentatious that I was deeply annoyed. If the movie changes the name of the country and president, it would be simply a laughingstock and huge box-office flop. Now it's got the publicity. Well done!

I was a bit bored in the beginning of the movie, especially because i wasn't introduced to something new. When the action started and they got a call from north- Korea i was easily distracted. When the FBI got in i got a bit more excited. The idea was in my opinion well thought of, but not that good executed. The stereotypical 'dumb' TV-host didn't amuse me, although James Franco made up for that. The ending was a bit too much, it looked fake to me and i didn't enjoy it.

But they have a lot of weird things. Such as no public internet, only a very small number of people among North Korea's elite use the mobile phones... All people in this country idolize their leader - Kim Jong-un. So when Sony Pictures presented this movie, hackers of North Korea Govenment hacked Sony's website and leaked a lot of documentations.

Anyone over the age of 12 would have a good time seeing this film. I think if a person goes into a comedy with an open mind they will have a better experience. It's a comedy! It's funny!

I wish someone nuke north Korea or assassinate that fat midget and i hope they give BitTorrent the right to release it. p.s As Sony is from Japan and Japan is near to North Korea i guess Kim jong un might have threatened to do something in Japan as well.

Franco, well the same can be said, in most cases, but the two together, on screen, it really does something for me. Franco's jokes are delivered in a way that only Franco can deliver them. Rogen is as witty as always, and quite frankly, I just love his style. Since Pineapple Express, I have enjoyed watching the chemistry that these two share on the big screen. This is the End, no different. That being said, I loved this film. I laughed VERY out loud several times. The film certainly had its downsides, and yes some of the punchlines are a little dragged-out, so to speak, but for me, this film resembled a more modern rendition of a very classical idea. Think about the classic films with the insane plots, and the outlandish ventures the protagonist would have to face. Yeah, The Interview is in the same breathe as those very films. The debauchery is quite substantial, yes, but from these two, did you really expect anything less? This is an amazing time for the film industry, certainly, with breathtaking imagery, phenomenal actors across the globe, and who can overlook our undying fascination with superheroes? Not me, that is for sure. I freakin' love it; but in my heart, I will always have an unwavering love for films that are willing to step directly on your toes, stare you directly in the eyes, make countless J.R.R Tolkien references, and then land numerous amounts of ""poo"" jokes. Seriously, they never stop, and that is my point exactly.I am happy to have more Rogen & Franco in my life again. I respect what they are doing, along with Evan Goldberg.

Maybe, because unlike reviewers who didn't like it, I was expecting it to be embarrassing to watch so was actually pleasantly surprised. I did find Franco's performance slightly over the top and a more subtle performance would have been funnier but otherwise a fun film. Seth Rogan's performance on the other hand was perfect. I do agree with a reviewer who mentioned that votes here must be rigged or paid for though. As of writing this review it has a very high 7.7 rating (100 000 votes for only 400 reviews which is a bit odd) . If you read through comments they're mostly negative so something doesn't quite add up. Anyway still recommend film if want some laugh out loud moments.",The Interview

And this movie moved so many people even before it's shown (i wish it will be some days), and forced selfish communists to react. Just like the other reviewers said, the achievement of this movie is enormous. Who said commies are far away? They are so near and even made you fail to see an American made movies in America's cinemas.I do believe this movie changed some people in this world already. So i give it 10.This is the 10th line",The Interview
755,andyirv,Is there a category for Painful?,1,3 January 2015,"I don't know where to begin. If I could give a negative star review, I would. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ever. And I have seen some doozies. When I was a kid, I used to stay up late on Saturday nights with my Dad and watch ""Planet of the Apes"" sequels or even old ""Godzilla"" movies on broadcast TV. My Dad used to say ""This movie is SO BAD its GOOD!"" I agreed, and I as I grew older I came to appreciate a Good-Bad movie. It was as if the directors/actors/writers/producers knew they were making a bad movie but they were making it to entertain the audience. It didn't matter if it sucked, the audience would get that and they'd still enjoy it. ""Point Break"" - GOOD-BAD!, ""Hard Ticket to Hawaii"" - got it on Blue- ray! So I rented ""The Interview"" knowing the controversy surrounding it, and I was hoping for an opportunity to watch another Good-Bad movie. Boy, was I wrong. Not only did my head began to throb, I became nauseous and dizzy. I literally became physically ill watching this film. I stopped it about 1/2 way through, not being able to continue even though I so wanted it to become one of those movies I could watch over and over and laugh and laugh and remember those Saturday nights with my Dad and chuckle and remember when Godzilla battled Gamera and everything was stupid and funny and....simple. This movie is nothing like that. Its the antithesis of that. It hurt. Seriously hurt. Whoever decided that this movie should have been made needs to find a new path in life. I think a career picking up spent cigarettes on the side of a highway on a blind curve would be a step up for these filmmakers. I will not even mention the actors, as I am sure I will never see them in another film unless it had to do with the digestive system of Gamera himself. The acting was just......bad. Pathetic. Please! Please, don't watch ""The Interview"" for any reason whatsoever. But.....if you must, if you have to watch it, make sure you pirate it for free, because if you spend any amount of money on it you will feel true pain. And I can't explain what your pain will feel like, because everyone reacts differently to having their eyelid hairs pulled out.",The Interview
756,heleneecotiere,"""The Interview"" is worth a try.",6,30 December 2014,"First of all, I must admit I'm not really keen on comedies in general and I usually don't even bother to watch those who are rumored to be daring or have the reputation for being cult before anyone actually saw the picture. In other words, I truly wasn't predisposed to enjoy, or even to watch, The Interview. And yet, since I expected a lot worst, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Naturally the movie has some flaws, such as James Franco's omnipresent unbearable pouts or a simplistic, if not nonexistent, direction, other reviewers did not fail to gush about. However, I do believe that if the viewer manages to disregard the slapstick humor and the characters' irritating propensity for repeating themselves, most likely in the vain hope that it'll be funnier the fourth time, he (or she) might get something out of it.""The Interview"" has the advantage of not being pretentious at all, just look at the poster with those two absurd men head-high gazing the nothingness in the most resolute way. Besides, some real issues are tackled by the movie, the total inability of the Pyongyang government to feed its own people for example, even though those matters are dealt with superficially and no actual accurate data are given. Yet, ""The Interview"" passes on knowledge about the situation in North Korea to a not-so-well-informed public, since today quite a large share of the population is still ignorant of the fact that the Kim Jong-un's regime is a dictatorship. Moreover some gags are fairly enjoyable, despite a few nonsensical scenes at the end of the movie, and the acting is rather decent, unlike what I anticipated after reading some virulent reviews.Therefore, ""The Interview"" may not fully deserve its current rate of 7,6/10, but still is worth a try.",The Interview
757,elinaannataurina,F you to tyranny,7,23 January 2016,"The Interview is a comedy-action movie that follows two idiots trying to assassinate the leader of North Korea - okay that we all know from the summary, but here's the honest review.Most people are going to see it just because the controversy - and that's completely understandable, I also saw it mostly, because of the controversy. And I have to agree, most of the jokes are cheesy and this movie delivers only few laughable one-liners. But I stayed (means - didn't switch off TV) not for the cheap stoner comedy, but for kinda good message it was sending. At least the ending was good and we got some sweet action scenes. And of course the sweet moment when Kim Jong Un died. Of course it is unreal, but it is a movie, it doesn't have to be real! Also movie portrays Kim as having deep psychological issues with his dad and his homophobia, however he probably is just a total sociopath. Of course all dictators have had some issues that made them that way. So it's believable (kinda)We got good ending, cute puppy, sweet ass action scenes, dictator dying and big F you to tyranny, so I'll give this 7 stars. If you expect good, not stoner qualitative comedy - this movie isn't for you, but if you expect a decent action movie that is enjoyable, then this movie is for you.",The Interview
758,therealstevenmatthews,Nothing like any other Rogen and Franco film. Unfortunately.,7,3 January 2015,"Over the past few years, Seth Rogen and James Franco have become masters of comedy filmmaking. Most of their films lack a developed plot and a strong purpose, but they still manage to receive positive reviews that praise their comedic talent. What they lack in purpose they always made up for with hilarious comedy. Unfortunately, The Interview is much different. It is impossible to compare The Interview to any other film made by Rogen and Franco due to the fact that The Interview was hardly funny at all. Surprisingly, the plot was fairly descent and had a well constructed sequence of events. The purpose was evident. The Film wanted to display how some people of the United States might perceive North Korea. Unlike most Rogen and Franco films, The Interview did make sense and that is why I'm giving it praise. Although the plot and purpose is worthy of an 8.5/10 the lack of comedy dropped my opinion on the film to a 7/10. The Interview lacked the hilarious punch lines that most Rogen and Franco movies have. The comedy was more foolish and stupid. The interview did not have any of those scenes that brought non-stop laughter. The few infrequent chuckles came from small one-liners rather than a few hysterically funny scenes. I don't think people are really understanding what The Interview is. Some people write reviews praising the film because they have the mind-set of ""This movie caused so much hype and it led to political issues, and it has two comedic geniuses."" Other people hated the film because they have the mind-set of ""I hate how everyone is making a big deal over another stupid movie so I'm going to try to destroy the hype that this movie brought by giving it a horrible review and calling it boring and politically incorrect."" I ignored both of these thoughts and I decided that I would go into this movie with an open mind and give my honest opinion. It is nowhere near as good as people say it is, but it is also nowhere near as bad as others say it is. It's just an average film. The Interview is just a movie with a good plot and purpose that lacks the comedy that we were hoping for.",The Interview

Korean torture if they didn't give it a ten.I would rather get a root canal, while giving a blumkin, than watch this movie again.I have one of those deep-rooted, developing, angry zits on the back of my neck, a bit behind my right ear - one of those super-painful ones... during this movie, I was squeezing it just to relieve some of the pain being inflicted on me by this terrible waste of Hollyweird budget.It is painfully obvious that Sony engineered fake threats from N. Korea and faked a hacking just to drum up a viral marketing stink around this dookie-turd, stench of a movie. Shame Sony, for your transparent attempts at trying to recoup a budget loser after dismal test-marketing showed you that this piece of rery rery crappy waste of HD video should be scratched from the annals, nay, anals, of history. Same also on all the talk shows and pundits that went along with your plan and bowed to Amber Isabel Smith's terrible deathgrip of ego-maniacal, sociopathic whims.I am embarrassed to even rate this ""film"" a ""1"", but that's as low as it will go, until IMDb allows honest ratings in the negative, but Amber won't allow that.",The Interview

You watch it because it is James Franco and Seth Rogen are bloody hilarious and know how to make a comedy. That's why so many people don't like this, because the story is very simple (like in 95% of any comedy movie). So just come here for the great jokes a lot of stereotypes and some new opinions on the infamous Kim Jong Un. Since this movie is also most probably going to start WW3 it is now a part of pretty important history and becomes a must watch movie.

In fact I'd say Sony's making MORE money now than they would have. Of course people will argue that in the US, only 300 theaters are showing it... oh wait you can now rent it for 2/3rds the price. Also Canada is now going to be showing this movie as well. This feels like so much more of a scam than before, and everyone fell for it.This movie was already going to be nothing but toilet humor and bad scripts as Seth Rogen is infamous for. But to add in the assassination of a real life country leader, who is currently in power, is way too much. Oh yes, other movies have done it. But not as a comedy. This film is just a mockery of a very dangerous person. Of course N.Korea can't do much against the States, but that doesn't mean they can't attack elsewhere.So in conclusion, Sony thanks you all for being mindless slaves and giving them more money than they would have originally gotten.",The Interview

I felt like the world was a better place, and that we had finally defeated the scum of the world. I've been a movie fanatic for my entire life, but this is the movie that has truly won me over. There needs to be a new category on this movie to show it's true power. My favorite parts in the entire movie was when Kim Jong Un was assassinated. He was a truly hated character, and was acted very well. It's hard to imagine hating someone as much as you can this character, it's like they actually interviewed him to find ways to see how terrible he was. I'm just glad this movie was made. My life may never be the same knowing that what I saw was just fiction, if this were a reality I would have celebrated even more.",The Interview

While all of this may be true, they have a real funny man as their dear leader. Seeing Kim Jong-un in the orgy scene in bed with all those women and men was classic. The dude likes to party, but is very sensitive to criticism. People wouldn't criticize him if he wasn't running around naked with fat rolls and a tiny wee-wee. SPOILER ALERT: There is a story within a story going on here. The entire country of North Korea and part of China gets nuked beyond all recognition. While this is sad and not funny, it is oddly satisfying.TEN STARSI only regret that it will takes thousands of years for North Korea to be habitable again so there will be no sequel in my lifetime.",The Interview

Not our nation perhaps, but hey, who's being picky? It's a classic East meets West, East commands West to eat it scenario. Kind of warms the capitalist cockles of your heart. First Sony, then Paramount (who won't let Alamo Roadhouse give out free American flags and cap pistols while showing Team America which uses f'n PUPPETS to poke fun at Dictator Daddy Kim).

Pirate Bay, as a matter of fact, was raided and taken down when films leaked from the hacks surfaced on the site - could information on those files pointed to Pirate Bay, and meant to disable an option of viewing, if Sony did release?Don't hate Sony. Sorry, President Obama, but your finger needs to point on the theater chains of America but worse than that, you need to help us cope with and overcome the fear that much of past decade has brought to our minds, when someone thousands of miles away threatens our way of life in a (in this case, not credible) declaration of terrorism.A satire will start a war, funny, huh?",The Interview

Not since the comedy movies of the cold war 80's has anyone made such a bold move towards showing the world that it is okay to poke fun at the most serious and evil dictatorship countries.

I gave this film a 7/10 because it had a decent plot, and some things were unexpected such as Kim Jong Un's behaviour,which was way out of my prediction of his character. James Franco's character was also enjoyable to watch because he was so energetic, and oddly right a lot of the time. The film didn't rank any higher or meet my expectations because as stated above, there were no ""gut-busting"" funny moments and some parts were pretty corny to me as well.

It comes very few times in a generation where a script brings so much depth to the characters in it. Sony has a gold mine on their hands here and I am happy to spend my entire pay check on it. My life was not complete but now I can die a happy man. Thank you Seth Rogan and James Franco you are God's among men. When I first heard this movie was coming out I was excited.

Visiting my local movie theatre in London and gaining true understanding of the actual American ideology towards the North Korean regime under Kim Jong Un, really changed me for the better. Being based on a true story I can't say I am too pleased with the outcome as there clearly are flaws in the movie: 1. Kim Jong Un is, to my understanding, still alive 2. Kim Jong Un does not die 3. Kin Jong Un will live forever Contextual accuracy is key when producing a movie of such importance and ideological representation.

James Franco is a great actor and has played good roles, his acting in this film is good also and obviously its a satirical movie there is some comedic parts but the script is just awful.

I recommend everyone to watch this movie. Go out to the theaters, watch it on YouTube, it's worth the money!

Very tastefully done - It was very serious where it needed to be. Does it contain dick jokes, cursing, and the general staple of Rogan/Franco stoner movies? Yes - Yes it does. It certainly does not disappoint in this department. However, with all of that is a carefully orchestrated film. It gets dark and gritty at times - very raw.Perhaps the most important part of the film is when the characters go off script of what brought them to North Korea. Both find something important to them, all while Kim Jung Un is portrayed as an adorable adolescent who doesn't understand the fundamental flaws of his world view. The movie captures the complexity of this very well. To see a known dictator struggle with daddy issues, and hero worship all while trying to continue deceiving his people and the world around him was a refreshing twist.It's a brilliant film that surprises.",The Interview

They keep you laughing with absurd and surprising scenes the entire time. Randall Park, as Kim Jong-un, was hilarious and the best part of the movie in my opinion. I can't say much without revealing, so check it out yourself. With that being said, the movie reveals subtle and real life issues that North Korea and the world are dealing with today and hopefully this film can accomplish more than entertaining us.

The movie is not nearly as bad as they tell you, but don't go in to it expecting to see a great or amazing movie, it's average to above average and is best defined as ""alright"" rather than ""good""As for the plot itself; without spoiling things, it seems to work. I can understand how the movie upset some in NK, as one of the key elements of the plot is something that is far worse than what many online (pre)reviewers have written about (you'll understand it when you see it) and it thus can truly be seen as subversive.

Then, they obviously re-write, re-cast with excellent impersonators, re-film and re-edit The Interview and somehow distribute it online worldwide, as there's no way a major Hollywood film studio would fund, film and release a movie of this caliber. Simply amazing. Will be interesting to compare the original product with this blatant deception of a movie. Can't wait 'til Sony releases it. A '1' rating for the NK-18 version is very generous. Now if North Korea wanted to do something good for humanity, they would have put a NK-99 rating on this version which should be strictly followed (with warnings to centenarians).",The Interview

I also wish it would have played out in the theaters, as I was really looking forward to watching it on the large screen. Well, what is done is done.On my rating, it is definitely around eight, inclined towards an eight plus, but due to the courage of the crew, I will give a well-deserved nine.",The Interview

This has got to be the greatest movie of all time. We Basically just flipped off Kim and all of North Korea and shoved our Freedom in their face. Overall the acting at some points was terrible. The real Kim is much fatter and Shorter like an Oompa Loompa but his Characteristics where right on. From his Temper Tantrum to his Homo-Erotic Ways.

My mom's world-famous spaghetti began leaking from every orifice of my body. It was magical. I started speaking in tongues, my head was spinning. Ectoplasm escaped my bellybutton and got all over my cat. I had to throw on my fedora to keep my mullet from falling off my head. My monitor exploded from the sheer excellence of this film and shards of glass got into my eye. I had to go to the hospital and my doctor asked me what happened.

The movie is over-hyped..would not be surprised if the entire Sony hack was a marketing stunt to make more from this movie then it actually is.Also the whole North Korea theme is idiotic and a very uneducated portrayal, its not the place of the west to make a satire like that...and if they do...at least they should put some effort into it.The movie is OK if you want to drink a beer and watch something that might be slightly funny from time to time...but the weak storyline really ruins this...and most of the time the jokes are not even funny and would only be to pot smoking teens.I can understand why North Korea takes this as an insult, you would at least think that when a sensible subject like this is being touched that it would at least be more intelligent.",The Interview
826,aidanbrown1998,Great for what it was.,9,25 December 2014,"Many people trash the dynamic dictator sllaying duo for their ""childish"" humour, and immature films. However, these people are members of a small demographic that do not enjoy this type of film - when in reality there is a much larger demographic pf people who enjoy them - hence why they keep making them. This film was different in a good way, and was much better than I had anticipated. I had previously thought it to be some funny movie where James Franco and Seth Rogan kill a dictator, when in reality it was a funny film not only poking fun and North Korea, but also America, in a clever way. I laughed more than I though I would, I cried more than I thought I would, and I overall enjoyed it more than I thought it would. For a ""Seth Rogan/James Franco"" film, it was pretty funny.",The Interview

All the media hype with banning the film etc Just to sell you this turd.if you still could bear Seth Rogen and James Franco, they make it impossible in this film.I've wasted 20 min of my time on this movie. Those men waisted years with that pathetic effort.Since Pineapple Express (which I had a good laugh at) the couple seems to choose the tackiest subjects for the movies since the cannot produce anything of the quality and must hunt cheap laugh off the ignorant audience.",The Interview
828,jordanmwhumphries,A modern classic,10,25 December 2014,"Let me start by saying I have just finished the movie and changed my underwear from an unfortunate accident that occurred from being so transfixed on what was quite frankly the greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I honestly cannot fault the movie in the slightest, I was constantly wiping my chin of the constant stream of saliva that was drooling from my mouth. Both Franco and Rogan's roles were so believable and captivating, and Park's portrayal of the eccentric S.Korean pop-star PSY is absolutely mesmerizing and will almost certainly be nominated for an Academy Award. An unmissable movie that will lead you on an emotional roller-coaster that will make you both laugh and cry... And soil your pants.",The Interview
829,fdztugit6,Just weird,1,25 December 2014,"I enjoyed the jokes a lot, the funny media critique, and how references (starvation fact, p** myth) interacted in the movie. But it's a strange movie, because despite it seems to be largely likable for a world-wide audience at first, it turns into a message to free North Korea, then also shows that being wounded for that matter is okay. Seth puts his wounded hand in the pocket, which is no comedy or splatter element for me. There's also shown a lot of military, and I feel like having watched a good amount of really good scripting for the sake of a concrete message what should be done in a certain country.When you take for example ""Running Man"" with a non-personal and more fictional story and compare them, ""The Interview"" is for me the inferior ""send the manipulating guy to hell"" movie, because after watching I feel being used as someone who should just accept a political message.I'm okay with the accusation that North Korea does things wrong, but it would only okay in a good documentary. That would be a fair basis to let viewers argue about the topic. A Comedy for this sake is just like a trick. ""Don't seriously argue about it too much, it's just comedy.""Being it propaganda like that, I can't give it more than 1 star. It's completely misguided.",The Interview
830,marteldrew,Cured my blindness and turned my tears into gold,10,25 December 2014,"I started watching this movie with very little knowledge about North Korea, except that it was a small country south of the United States and boarders Canada. I had heard that the leader of North Korea did not poop or pee, and could speak with dolphins.I laughed, I wept, I screamed, and I cheered. I now know that North Korea's leader is nothing more than a mere mortal and that he actually does poop and pee like the rest of us. This movie is so amazing, so incredible that is cures blindness and turns your tears (you will cry during this movie) into gold.I highly recommend this movie for anyone looking to find out more about North Korea's reclusive leader, as this movie is pretty much a non- fiction biography on Kim Jung Un. And challenges much of what we Westerners thought we knew about Kim (that he was some kind of god) - Who would of thought he was just a chubby guy with a loose butt hole.",The Interview
831,antoniabufalino,Even Kim Jong Un would laugh,10,25 December 2014,"I thought this movie was HILARIOUS. However, this is a young generation movie. It's incredibly sarcastic and crude, and if you don't like that kind of humor you probably won't like the movie. There's not much substance it's just ridiculous. I know younger folk are really loving this stuff right now, so if you do, you'll be in cinematic heaven. It's the type of humor This Is The End, Zoolander, and Anchormen two have. But if you know you don't have that type of humor, then you probably won't like it. The sarcastic, over-the-top humor that Rogan and Franco love to use in their movies was spot on. From the opening to the ending scene, I was laughing. If you liked This Is The End, you will LOVE the Interview. I'm about to watch it again upstairs because it was so good. It was so ridiculously funny, that I was bent over in pain from laughing so hard. The climax of the movie had me project my body to the floor and just lay there laughing, crying, laughing, then crying.

832,greshamjr-ricky-195-665360,Who knew James Franco could be so funny,10,25 December 2014,"The initial reason I decided to watch this movie was due to all the controversy surrounding it. I really didn't expect much considering Seth Rogan was one of the lead actors in the film. Seth Rogan delivers the same unfunny role in which he does in all his films. The real star of the show surprisingly is James Franco. I have never seen James play in a role like he did in this film but, now that I have witnessed just how funny he can be, I can't wait to see him in another comedic role like he plays in The Interview.For the $5.99 I payed to view this film from my home, it was worth every penny. This film is funny as all could be. I really enjoyed this film. What have you got to lose, watch the film and see for yourself how funny and entertaining it is.",The Interview
833,rossaperry,Satire on Life,10,25 December 2014,"I can't help but think of Dennis Rodman when watching this movie. Our main hero seems to mock Dennis's understanding of reality and basic comprehension of the world. Our hero, aside from being horribly racist and unsympathetic to Asian stereotypes, he is a pretty innocent guy who get's fooled by the supreme ruler. Later he finds out the truth, but will a jab at an old memory stop our reporter from completing his mission? Not if Seth Rogan can help it! It's a fun movie along the line of Inglorious Bastards. There is a weird running joke about honey potting, but it doesn't take much away from the film. It's wonderfully cast, the cinematography is spot on, and the overly glory, but brief special effects are not over the top, but comfortably resting on the brim. There are funny lines, but it really take home the perspective that the North wants people to see itself as. This movie is fairly mild for Western audiences, but if the people of North Korea saw this film, they might just start a revolt as the movie suggests.This movie deserves a ten and my money just for putting it out there for net release. Merry Christmas Sony and everyone else. This is the best present I could ever have...FreedomBegun, The Cyber war has.",The Interview
834,leo-roux5,Excellent,10,25 December 2014,"I downloaded this movie as soon as it went online. Living in France and having heard everything about it since the Sony hack, I just had to watch it. If North Korea is really behind the hack, and they probably are, I understand why they did it. Their Supreme Leader, Kim Jong Un, gets made fun of by one amazing American journalist who just gets his way with people. I admit that the storyline is fairly straightforward, that we're expecting the ""twist"" here and there, in other words, it's not a masterpiece. But do we really care? I think this movie is sending a message, that even in the worst country of the world, on the brink of a potential war, we don't care about taboo. We need to talk about the issues of this country.This movie cracked me up so many times, and knowing that there is so much drama behind it, I couldn't do anything else but to rate it 10/10. Sony, if not the two brilliant actors, deserve that.",The Interview

Spinner content is computer generated content. There is no actual reference to any part of the movie. There are several words repeated. No structure, logic, or relevancy is in the review. A reference to the birth of Christ? Really? Who in their right mind takes the time to register and leaves such junk in the review? Surely, if someone felt so strong they would write a half decent summary? These are computer generated reviews left by the American propaganda machine!What's worse is that the review of this user is the first review listed....over 400 people gave the review a thumbs up? Something is wrong here folks!!One of the first indications of spamming is the amount of votes within just a few days. And that the reviews are all perfect 10's making it the best movie ever made!!! Better than the currently popular frozen? Godfather? Cast away? Etc The interview is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

( maybe all planed out in first place, who knows )before I actually rate the film, let me tell you one thing. you shouldn't rate movies ass high because of your patriotism or any other political idea. first, this just blur's the real quality a movie has to offer and second, big trust-able pages like IMDb get bad credit for that and cant be taken serious anymore. ( if happened all the time, this is a single case here of course. )Just rate the movie for its being a movie-sake. ( i know its hard after all this media stuff that accrued )to the movie :its a good comedy movie. it has everything for a ""im not going out tonight"" - Friday.but its nothing special, really. you watch it once, you laugh here and there. good soundtracks ( personal taste ) but thats it..this wont stop this movie from haven its name written in history books. you know why.",The Interview
837,ourtwoism,An awesome roller coaster.,8,25 December 2014,Saying that people who have rated this 9+ stars just for patriotism is like me saying that people who gave it 2 or less stars only did so because they're scared that they're gonna get shot. Totally ridiculous. This movie IS NOT: 1.) Satire 2.) For people who can't laugh at dick/poop jokes. 3.) For people who can't laugh at slapstick humor 5.) For people who get easily or even moderately offended by profanity.This movie IS: 1.) For people that can laugh at absurdity. 2.) Very fun. 3.) A roller coaster ride. 4.) At times kind of a black comedy.Which brings me to why I love this movie. I love satire more than any other genre. But this is not satire. It's kind of annoying to hear everyone here saying that this was a shitty satire. It's more of a black comedy. Which is kind of an infamous genre. Sometimes you don't know whether to laugh or to cry or maybe even get a little angry - I love when movies do that.,The Interview

Two idiots get an interview with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un than try and kill him so everyone can be free and live like Americans. James Franko acts like a 10 year old spoilt brat the whole movie, it gets that annoying you have to fast forward when you see him.

839,chavezkain,Seth and James are at the TOP,8,25 December 2014,"Now obviously this isn't a smart comedy movie. Most of the jokes have to do with the male privates. The jokes are funny none the less though. As for plot... it's actually pretty good. Nice and straight forward. It's not even a stoner comedy so most people can enjoy it.This is probably Seth Rogens best movie. For once he is not an idiot and you can take him semi-seriously in this movie. His character is a bit silly at times, but it's not his normal Seth Rogen playing Seth Rogen. Now since Seth isn't playing the idiot some one has to and it's none other than James Franco. It's not his best performance, but he does a great job at doing what is asked for the character.Over all... GREAT FILM... wish I could have seen it in theaters.",The Interview

This could've passed by as just another dumb, skippable comedy. Potty humor, body parts, and juvenile sex references were the tone throughout.James Franco's Skylark character makes Ron Burgundy seem deep and culturally aware. I'm just going to forget that his name is Skylark, and remember Percy Shelley's skylark instead. But what a fun performance he delivered.Okay, I laughed. Crass jokes catch me off guard and I laugh, and a time or two, the humor was deft. But mostly I was waiting for that comedic horror of are-they- really-doing-this, you know, like SNL's Appalachian Emergency Room or Family Guy, but I never felt this.At $6 for three of us to watch at home, the ticket price was right, but I can't help feeling I was being played. If so and by whom, I may never know, but this movie seems to have been made to be a stunt rather than a legitimate movie. Plot, characters, dialogue, set - nothing seemed worthy of a Seth Rogan-James Franco Christmas day release.(Donnie Darko and Milk were inspiring. They've done other movies since, so the banality of this movie was entirely predictable.)It's like some scheme were devised in the dark corners of some intelligence agency to jeer at the bumbling North Korean dictator in the way he cares about most: pop culture. Maybe this is like the Shakespearean clown speaking truth disguised as jest, the way Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart do. Or maybe Seth Rogen is taking his own stand for freedom of expression by setting this in motion. Certainly, I would never have picked this movie if not for the political blow-back.A real human point underlies all the silliness, and maybe this is what The Interview is about. The atrocities are real. Rather than laughing over these or aggravating the capricious nature of the leader, I am hoping this movie informs people around the world to the atrocities of daily life in North Korea.",The Interview
841,asianjewforce,Actually A Good Movie,9,25 December 2014,"First off, don't listen to the people who rate this a one star. They clearly haven't seen the film, or want to seem like they're some snobby film buff. If you like Seth Rogan/ Franco movies, you WILL enjoy this movie. The characters are hilarious and surprising deep, especially Franco and Kim Jung Un. Rogan is still great however, and had one of the best fight scenes out of all his movies (gruesomely hilarious). I saw some reviews complaining about the characters being dumb, and I honestly don't understand what movie they were watching. The humor is no where near 3 stooges level, and the movie actually has some witty political commentary going on. Obviously, the hype for this movie caused a lot of people to either love it or hate it. I'm in the category of loving it, but I'm normally not one to bandwagon (after all, I have a windows phone). If you already hate these types of comedies, odds are you aren't gonna change your mind. But if you take the movie for what it is (a comedy), you'll have a blast.

842,jurugi,"Horrid Film: A North Korean parody of the US, made by the US",2,25 December 2014,"I just walked out of this movie half way through because I couldn't take it anymore. It wasn't funny at all; in fact it was 'cringe-worthy'. The acting was horrible. It was like a 10 year old's story about a guy who was made fun of by the popular 'real reporters' because all he did was report about celebrities, and then he goes on to interview Kim Jong Un. You would think it has good effects or something at least.. not really. Nothing is funny or grand about it at all. I hated that they started the movie making fun of Eminem and went on to make fun of/degrade other American celebrities. I didn't even chuckle once. There's not really anything funny or patriotic in the whole film.. In my opinion this film should have been pulled because it actually 'harms' America's image. This is a horrid movie which will be viewed and hated by everyone because of the hype that it's already generated. Not only were the actors not really amazing, but the whole story was uninteresting and simplistic like a 12 year old's plot. Even being tired out of my mind at night, which usually serves to 'enhance the movie experience' for me by making me not realize little details and things that might be wrong about a movie, did not serve as a refuge from cringing at the horrid acting and scene play. I don't understand why it had to be released. The movie was utterly bad and not worth seeing.Ask yourself: What kind of perception of America does this put out? This is more harmful to America than to North Korea.. Total idiocy. It should be common sense to not degrade yourself, yet they managed to mess up a parody that's supposed to make fun of someone else.. that's pretty hard to do in my opinion. Would not recommend, would rate like 3/10 for effort.﻿ (I added a +1 because of the hype but it really deserves 2/10 or 1/10.)",The Interview

Seth Rogan was Seth Rogan as I do not expect much from him, a 'humph' kind of acting (repeat the non-word in your head a few times). The script had potential for a few laughs but these guys and the rest of the cast could not pull it off. Randall Park had a good moment at the 'banquet' with his 'rant' but the rest was bad.

Personally I liked Seth Rogen and James Franco in the movie This is the End and their slapstick humor remains the same. I didn't expect an academy award winning performance so the movie turned out to be exactly what I thought it would be; a goofy comedy poking fun at NK but also the CIA and the whole TV news celebrity interviewer genre.

848,jafranz,Bloody Brilliant,10,26 December 2014,"Anyone who is familiar with the body of work that Mssrs James Franco and Seth Rogen have produced will not find this to be a disappointment. Following the long happy trail of Pineapple Express, This Is The End, and Freaks and Geeks, not counting their movies without each other, this feature exhibits the very best of their comedy. Ranging from political humor, to awkward sex, and the narcissism that makes idiots lovable, The Interview hits every major comedic milestone en route to making North Korea shut down the Internet.Personally, I could not be more thrilled with the production and the cast, as each takes their role to a new level, and while for many of these character actors it is old hat, Lizzy Caplan and Randall Park take their new roles to heights unfathomed. Franco and Rogen as usual make the most of their roles and much like their Bound3 parody's, they make the modern social perception of sex look ludicrous and outrageous. Sure, people will think it is a stupid comedy, and they will be right. Others might think that this is a rip off the same motifs done over and over again. They would be correct too. And those politically conscious individuals with a moral air of superiority might say that this movie has rightly caused so much chaos over the last month or so. That's debatable but I see the point. None of that detracts from the amazing acting, excellent script, and fantastic movie that is now on display, since Sony has grown a pair and aired the movie wherever it can.",The Interview

I was completely satisfied with the authenticity of the portrayal of this ruthless leader, and giving him some human frailty was pure genius. There were many, many brilliant moments, surprises and exciting filming. I could not look away, and I laughed through the entire movie. I really felt I got my money's worth, no disappointments at all. I couldn't give two hoots about Sony, or whatever, but the story was brilliant and the acting was second to none. If they don't win some awards, then the so-called experts are idiots. There was a little violence, but it was needed, and not unacceptable.

Admittedly, I walked into this movie with high expectations. I thought I'd get to see a smart, witty movie commenting politics. I mean why else would someone go as far as NK allegedly did to stop this movie from getting on the silver screen?I was glad to see that the inviolability of freedom of speech was honored after all and the movie is shown after all. But when I actually watched it I couldn't help but think that maybe NK didn't want anybody to see this flick because it is just plain terrible.After making it through the first few minutes i abandoned my hopes of getting to watch a good piece of satire and instead thought, oh well, maybe it's still a nice, light comedy. But it only got worse and worse. At times it was downright painful how the two idiotic main characters indulged in distasteful penis jokes. Not once did this movie succeed to even make me grin and I have to say it stinks just as Dave skylarks penis supposedly does. I do not give this movie 1/10 stars because I want to even out all the 10/10 it got as political statements in advance but because it simply is an awful movie with a sense of humour one can usually find in equally terrible German movies starring Michael Bully Herbig.

I'd like to ask why the crack-heads living 30 minutes from your home are hungry just as the people over somewhere you have no idea about is suffering. What concerns me is that this movie is pure form of entertainment.However, it addresses some serious issues that people face. and Hollywood nor Sony productions is in the position to mock or criticize. It is sad many won't be able to realize the faults journalism and media cause in effecting its viewers. In promoting racism and stereotypes at all is wrong. People, take a minute to think about it the other way. Take a second to question what has such a dangerous regime done to you? Who should be antagonized the one who creates war or the one who tries to separate itself from war?South America, Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan. Looking at the facts. America has invaded over 22 countries in the last 20 years.

However, I had to watch it and initially it made me angry that a young girl was signing such horrible things about the USA. I really liked James Franco in this film though. He played an amazing role being a late night show host. Eminem comes out as gay though. The funny parts were when James Franco and ""Kim Jong Un"" bonded for a slight moment. However the most exciting part to watch was when he interviews Kim Jong Un. He actually gets his escape plan as he first wanted to when he spoke to the CIA. I'd go on and on but you really need to watch it.",The Interview
855,rohititm,Total waste and crap,1,26 December 2014,"I just watched this whole crap while expecting all the time something major or hilarious to happen, but to my total disappointment, it turned out to be a complete waste of time.I decided to watch this movie because of the controversy surrounding it and initially thought that it would at least be a time pass comedy, but even on the grounds of comedy genre, it falls flat. Few gory scenes, some adult language, few mentions to body's private parts and a total illogical and unreal script, that's the whole summary of this movie.On a brief, no punches, no situational comedy, no nothing, just hype.If you have any plans to watch this movie, better re-consider that, instead watch ""DUDE WHERE'S MY CAR"" or ""21 JUMP STREET"", will give you many laughs and hilarious moments.",The Interview
856,gubrian,HILARIOUS -- Seriously!,10,27 December 2014,"I think the controversy over this movie must have generated interest far outside of its target audience, because I can't imagine a Seth Rogan fan not liking this movie. I literally laughed all the way through it. I think it's one of the funniest movies of the last few years and one of Rogan's best. (It is way funnier than Neighbors, which I considered to be a disappointment.) Beyond that, though, the movie takes on much more than its reputedly simplistic plot about killing a dictator -- it is a biting commentary on totalitarian rule. This is satire at its very best. I can see why North Korea wanted it squelched. More than an affront, this would be a deeply subversive statement to them.",The Interview
857,cheyanne-dean,Surprisingly smart for this brand of comedy,8,27 December 2014,"If you are familiar with Rogen's brand of humor, the jokes in this movie won't be as surprising. If you hate that kind of comedy, you will not find this movie appealing at all. However, if you do enjoy it, this movie has some good qualities. There are some great underlying messages that are brought out in a humorous way, like self-love and acceptance, as well as the importance of honesty and truthful journalism. It also makes a strong political statement in a way that the average person might be more comfortable with than on CSPAN. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised.",The Interview

Sony Needed a ""Hack"" to Sale This!!!",1,27 December 2014,"I have never written a movie review in my life, but I felt so compelled to write about this... this... this... I can't even find the words to describe this atrocity called a movie. It was so terrible, tasteless, tacky and not funny in the least bit. It was so bad, North Korea couldn't even be offended!!! I felt offended as an American, and as a fan of Seth Rogen and James Franco... how dare they insult my loyalty by offering this rubbish?!!! I couldn't even finish it. I gave it 50 minutes trying to force myself to enjoy it and I just couldn't do it. Don't waste your money, your time, or your neurons. This was seriously one of the worst movies, possibly the worst, of all time. I will never look at Seth Rogen or James Franco the same again... my heart hurts on this day.",The Interview
859,tspeco,Low brow,3,27 December 2014,"Regardless of the political scandal, I just want to do a fair review of the movie as it is. First of all, before you watch the movie, dial down your IQ to below age 11 and you'll enjoy it more; if you ever want to torture yourself.The satire in fact fails to address anything really matters. The actings were horribly done intentionally in a dramatic fashion. The plot is bland with a mix of biases and prejudices. If the use of free speech is to portray certain stereotypes floating in the distorted mind of the general public then it has certainly failed to use it in a better sense to lift the public conscious.I find the idiotic dialogues and low brow jokes overused and just plain bored after so many similarly lame Hollywood movies came out these days. It's certainly a sad state to see these kind of movies came out to big screen. A sign of decline of the Hollywood intelligence/caliber and the state of the affair of the country overall.",The Interview
860,kurt-burkhardt,Good movie for some great laughs,8,27 December 2014,"I watched this last night and was pleasantly surprised. I expected a cheesy movie with nothing more than hype pulling audiences in. What I saw instead was a very well done movie with convincing special effects and they type of comedy you'd expect from Seth Rogen. I thought it was very funny, and certain scenes had me laughing out loud. Don't listen to the haters out there. If you like goofy comedies and see the movie without preconceived notions of what comedy should be, you'll like The Interview. This is the kind of movie you simply sit back and enjoy for a good laugh. Don't try and dissect it, if you do (as with any movie) you'll find a reason not to like it. It seems like more people are adamant on tearing the movie apart then simply enjoying it for the goofy comedy that it is.",The Interview
861,sirkasiro,Seth Rogen has way too many groupies.,4,27 December 2014,"When this movie first came out it had an average of 9.8 out of 10 with 45 000 votes, I thought this movie is probably not 9.8 but it must be damn good.But damn was I disappointed.If you've seen This is the end or Neighbors, it's the same kind of dumb humour coupled with some of Seth Rogen's recycled jokes. Usually I would think this movie is aimed at a specific audience but even then, I highly doubt they would give it anything better than a 8.I'd rate this movie ZERO if I could just to balance back the ratings but honestly I did get a few laughs out of it. While I would original have given it a 6 I'm giving a 5 for the previous mention. Also, if you've been the previews, you've seen the best of it.In the end, if you loved ""This is the end"" or ""neighbors"" and don't mind the recycled jokes, you will enjoy it.",The Interview
862,boxfox0,If Fight Club and Heat had a baby,10,27 December 2014,"The movie was hands down the best cinematic experience I have ever had. It was a sophisticated roller coaster of emotion that flung and looped the the center of my being to places I have never been. It has romance,it has action, and such a splendor of visual effects that that I literally wept. To put it in perspective I love this movie like I love my wife, except I'd save this movie from a fire. Before I saw this movie I had cancer, saw the movie, no cancer. The movie was so fantastic that time actually stopped. It has a run time of zero minutes because the creative genius behind it was so great that the the fabric of time was effectively torn. This rivals the birth of Christ and I highly recommend this film.",The Interview
863,captainstonerr,Let's keep this short,2,27 December 2014,"I didn't have the highest expectations, for this movie.. and still it disappointed me in many ways. The whole movie I was waiting to have a laugh. What I saw instead was an unfunny, unnecessarily provocative (almost propaganda like) film, with only one message: Kim Jong Un and North Korea in general suck - America rules ! It was a brainless, and boring movie I would not recommend anyone to watch (not only because you have to even pay Money to stream it, although it was banned from being showed in cinemas, in Germany at least). The only good thing were the visual effects, but you have to expect that from a movie which had a production value as high as 44mio. $. So just watch a good Movie, instead of giving 'The Interview' more attention than it deserves.(Sorry if I have made some mistakes, I'm not a native speaker as you can guess.)",The Interview

Inglourious Basterds Dumb & Dumber version: Adam Sandler style? I liked This is the end, infinitely better.

Only a propaganda film, sad for what has come to make American cinema.It's certainly smutty-and infantile.Please note, a film about the assassination of a president of a country is presented as ... comedy!

And in other words,like James Franco said-""Don't hate us cause you ain't us."" This movie is hilarious! The best action comedy that has been put out in a long time. OMG it's just too funny! James Franco and Seth Rogan killed it. The whole Cast was awesome.

Everything in this movie i could predict at the beginning of the scene.I read some positive reviews on IMDb and could not stop thinking about this scene in idiocray (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGlJgU9x8tM) about people in the future being so dumb, they enjoy watching an farting ass for 90 minutes (farting ass movie is haute culture compared to this).After seeing this movie i hoped the hack was just an excuse not to release this embarrassing peace of crap.I normally am a advent believer in free speech, after seeing this shitty movie i think there are somethings people should be protected against (pun intended).",The Interview
867,buzzkill-197-307945,Worst 1:52 I will never get back,3,28 December 2014,"Rented sort of as a silent protest. This movie sucks. Rogen almost looks embarrassed to be in it. Franco is mostly just a moron. There is nearly zero character depth or development. The movie was so bad and boring my wife got up and decided to finish cleaning the bathroom (I am not kidding). The jokes, if they can be called that, mainly involve the anus in some fashion. The comedic ""theme"" is old in the first 10'miutes of the movie. Roger looks tired and Franco looks like he is trying too hard. The only ""acting"" that takes place is from Park and Bang who are probably hoping the stink washes off so they can still have a career after this. The scene with Eminem is one of the highlights, as well as a scene involving a tank with Franco and Park. Save yourself the $6 and wait for it to be free on Amazon Prime which should not take too long.",The Interview
868,terigo12,It was a movie.,7,28 December 2014,"I can't understand why people would say ""It's terrible"" ""It only gets high reviews cause of the current situation"" ""It wasn't funny"" Its a freaking movie and it's just about what I expected and slightly more. I didn't think my sides were going to be in orbit the whole time, I pretty much knew the direction the movie was going the entire time but I still enjoyed it. To say that it may have only been good cause of its shock value and because of it's blatant attempt at pushing the edge of our current situation with North Korea is kind of just being a captain hindsight. Of course that's why its good. That is all that we expected to see, why the heck else did you want to watch the movie? It's still a good movie despite some idiots thinking that because they showed what we all expected it was somehow a one star movie, those people need to grow up and get a life, that's one of the reasons I never take movie ratings serious anymore cause all the ""Critics"" don't know what they're talking about anymore. They spend their time trying to be over critical and pretty much only rate bad indie movies highly cause its not ""Mainstream"" And doesn't have actors that anyone knows so we don't already know their personality. In short its worth a watch and don't listen to the idiots who think they know what the general public likes. Most of the people who would review a movie are essentially hipsters who spend too much of their lives pointing out flaws in movies so they can act like they know a thing or two (People who could take the fun out of fun dip or fundamentals, whichever sparkles for you ;) )",The Interview
869,walter-bays,Good for a dumb movie. Kim is not the only target,8,28 December 2014,"I never would have watched ""The Interview"" but for the highly unconventional marketing campaign by North Korea. The movie must not be judged among other movies with a powerful message for Western values and American freedom, like ""The Grapes of Wrath."" Rather it must be compared among comedies in which the funniest things are slapstick violence and sniggering references to bodily functions.Within that genre, it is an excellent movie. Many of the jokes work well, even many sophomoric jokes at which you'll be ashamed to laugh. I'm not sure why North Korea takes such offense, as Kim Jong Un is portrayed in a more sympathetic light than I expected.American journalism receives a harsher mocking, with its obsession with shallow sensational ""news"" above content and critical analysis. As Dave says, ""That's the first rule of journalism! Give the people what they want!"" Indeed if it turns out that North Korea really wasn't behind the hacking attacks on Sony Pictures then my main suspect would be Fox.",The Interview
870,mtwhitney36,Much better than expected,10,28 December 2014,"First, i recommend that people who see this movie first familiarize themselves with the human rights atrocities of the north Korean regime, they have been compared to both the Nazis and Stalin by the united nations and organizations that do Holocaust research.I went to see this movie as a statement against the north Korean dictatorship, my expectations were very low, i believed most of the professional reviews and the reviews that are on this site, i thought i would be sleeping through the movie, boy was i wrong. I also watched Charlie Chaplan's movie ""the great dictator"", and i believe this movie is written in that spirit, updated for our time.Interview explores the nature of dictatorships, like ""the great dictator"", but goes one step further by looking into why western media is so fascinated by dictators, and why pacifists tend to rationalize the dictators by overstating abuses in democratic countries, which certainly exist, and are condemnable, but no where near the scale of those of the dictatorship.I like how ""interview"" shows the similarity between our megalomaniac business leaders and dictators, their lust for success, wealth, and power, their promiscuous and over indulgent life style, and how it is both self destructive and destructive of society. Interview is almost as critical of the entertainment industry as it is of the north Korean dictatorship.The beginning of the movie is a little slow and boring, and too predictable, but it picks up nicely as the plot becomes more complex. Interview draws on actual events in north Korea, such as the attempts to influence dictator ill by visits from western celebrities. The comedy was OK to good, the action decent, the plot was much better than the movie was given credit for. Very little nudity, but their is a huge amount of profanity and references to grotesque sexual behavior which is common among the rich and powerful in the west, and foreign dictators.I rated this very high, maybe more that it deserves because i was expecting so much less. On the other hand, how would the reviewers have rated ""the great dictator"" if they saw it in 1940?",The Interview
871,jhrbst,"Really, really bad",2,28 December 2014,"Wow. Its been a long time since I've seen a movie so poor and so embarrassing to the American people. This movie typifies the perception that Americans are total ignorant idiots. The movie is really really terrible, the plot is really bad, the acting really corny, it portrays both sides as really stupid and, well, its just rubbish and a real pain to sit through. Avoid if possible. The hackers probably hacked Sony as they were American and were too embarrassed to have something like this shown to world with an American brand.After watching this there are only two plausible explanations for Sony withdrawing this movie and then deciding to put it out: 1. Someone at Sony actually watched the movie and realized what a load of garbage it was. They then realized that it will tank at the box office so decided to pull it and create a political pull about the taboo element and have people beg them to release it thus creating demand. Marketing brilliance on the part of Sony. 2.Sony were truly embarrassed to release it after seeing it so decided to pull it and save the world from it. They then got caught in a difficult situation and were forced to release it.Forget water-boarding at Guantanamo....just make the inmates watch this movie...total inhumane torture. For those really bad people, make them watch it twice.",The Interview

I do not understand why there are so many low ratings (koreans perhaps?). Tarantino, Spielburg, Aronofsky, Lynch- all droopey eyed armless children compared to Rogen. The Interview has set a precedent that future film makers will struggle to even touch. My sides hurt from laughing, my eyes were sore from crying, and my pants were warm and smelly from sharting when i left the theater. I've never gone through the entire emotional spectrum while watching a film before. This movie has everything... comedy , romance, action, drama. The Interview was a piece of ART. anyone who cant see the genius behind this movie is either communist sympathizer or brain dead. I paid to see this movie and would gladly do it again. Those who comment about regretting paying to see it only have themselves to blame seeing that it was streamed for free over multiple websites. It is such a shame Rogen and Sony will probably lose $ over the greatest film in history.",The Interview

Yes, I am not fan of Seth Rogan and there are some James Franco movies I did not mind seeing, but this really had me thinking; Would I have watched this piece of crap if there was no hacking scandal? The premise of the movie is a good one i.e. make fun of the media, CIA, US foreign policy (that is the American way). However this movie failed on all counts. The only person who looked good in the movie was the North Korean dictator himself. He seemed like a kind of guy who had layers like an onion. Peel one layer off and you get another layer, with tears flowing as a result of the power of the onion (not due to laughter or any sadness as the movie lacked both). That the FBI ruled North Korea, not only capable but responsible for the hack must mean the CIA was not willing to go along with such crap. They would rather the FBI sully their reputation instead. Obama cannot be as idiotic as to have been bought by Sony. There is no campaign, though perhaps he is looking for money to build his presidential library and that may explain why he went to bet for this crap. If you value your time don't see it, but then again, see it to be aware of similar stunts in the future. Wag the Dog!!!",The Interview
874,CMoore0520,Movie was terrible,2,28 December 2014,"I was expecting it to be comparable to Pineapple Express, considering the same actors starred in the film. I watched it on Christmas Eve with my dad and brother; dad fell asleep a 15 minutes in and my brother left halfway through. Despite wanting to turn it off halfway, I stuck with it to the end. The story got a little better in the second half, but overall the movie was terrible. Jokes didn't land, the story was not good, etc. I have to say that Franco's character was actually annoying in the first half. I see people quoting the film on their Facebook status the next day as if the movie was some instant classic (""They hate us 'cause they ain't us!"") - if that was the best line, the sense of humor of these people is that of a 13-15 year old. Honestly, I am just glad that I only paid $6 to rent it online rather than $12 at a theater.",The Interview

The Story line has some possibilities, but it falls flat so many times. James Franco is absolutely horrible, with his dialogue being so over the top stupid and his inability to deliver it with any kind of skill in comedy. Seth Rogen, to some extent manages to save moments of the movie but I don't think he has the screen presence to hold a whole movie together like this. I will admit though that the very few moments I chuckled watching this were when he was on screen. The North Koreans were poorly acted and I never got any sense that they were in any real danger from them. Movies like this one need to be avoided. If you ant to stick it to North Korea, by all means watch it and get the view numbers up, but do not expect anything even close to a decent movie.",The Interview

This movie made me laugh, it's as simple as that. It's a classic Franco and Rogen movie with a great contribution from Randall Park as the supreme leader.People seem to forget that this is a simple minded comedy and tear it apart for being insulting, inaccurate and offensive. It's not a documentary, it's a great addition to comedy films in 2014. A comedy nor a comedian should always be politically correct as it simply wouldn't be funny to watch Franco and Rogen going into Korea to meat Kim Jong Un and have a cup of tea with him.You might love it, you might hate it, but you have to watch the great supreme leader sing Fireworks by Katy Perry.",The Interview

It's juvenile and vulgar, without reason but predictable, packed with dumb-ass jokes (literally) that are really an insult to anyone's intelligence. Sony should thank the hackers, IF it didn't stage the whole hack itself after realizing the film is utter garbage. Before I saw this film I truly thought North Korea cyber-attacked Sony, after I saw it I think Sony flat out staged the whole thing because who the f**k would hack this piece of sh*t?!

Sony had a stinking Turkey on their hands for Xmas,and they knew it, but not even Cranberry sauce could sweeten this one. Not a single laugh In fact, my jaw was sore only from trying to restrain the yawns. I think the only gripe North Korea could have with this Film would be under the trades description act of of calling this a comedy. To have created a major diplomatic incident over this trash is the only laughable part of the whole sorry saga. So....what next from Sony? perhaps a movie about Putin in a farcical gay love triangle? That ought to spark a worldwide media frenzy, which would see the tills ringing at the box office for months. I wish I'd stuck to watching BBC Christmas repeats instead.",The Interview

The Interview is a film filled with slapstick comedy and a few cringe worthy moments. For me this movie made me laugh, mainly due to Franco and Rogan's on and off screen chemistry and humor, which is what made this film a watchable piece. This movie is pretty predictable and the storyline isn't anything ""special"", but the film itself and the characters created is what made this film an enjoyable experience.Most of the comedy throughout this film is quite obvious, but this film definitely did not waste my time. From the moment I sat down, to the moment I got up, this movie had me hooked to the screen.

Everything about the movie made an impression on me to the tiny details in the cinematography. James Franco and Seth Rogen really made the movie more than just any regular comedy. It had a lot more action that I think a lot of people will enjoy. The comedy isn't crappy one-liners, its all about the acting. Really enjoyed the talent of all the actors involved including the guy who played Kim Jong Un. Cheers! Keep up the good work. Hope there are many more movies with this kind of comedy and acting in the future as many of the recent comedies lack any humor. Well balanced comedic takes along with action. Definitely more of a family movie than any other comedy. P.S. NK can go suck a fat one!",The Interview
890,friendlyfoe78,entertaining but not worth the hype,5,5 January 2015,was a bit of a laugh but not a bundle. worth the look if you have time but wouldn't spend a fortune on it. better off with this book if you want to find out a bit about DPRK www.amazon.com/North-Korea-On-Inside- Looking-ebook/dp/B00I5VB6C2/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1 the characters were pretty weak and the Kim Kong Un was kinda dull. tried to be slapstick but failed. no real great lines or anything that would have you laughing could be better to watch team America. the film was short enough though to make it suffer-able and fast moving enough to not get bored which was possible at certain stages if it was to be dragged out much longer. still it is probably better that this hasn't gone to mainstream cinema as it would likely have got panned as it definitely doesn't live up to the hype but I guess Sony has benefited from the hacking.,The Interview
891,eyelashes333,People are assuming too much,10,5 January 2015,"I saw some people say they gave the movie a 1/10 just to bring the rating down. Well I'll give it 10/10 because I loved it and believe it deserves it. I saw it in a theater last night where most people were laughing throughout the movie. It was enjoyable and funny. I think people heard about the hype and expected the movie to be something more than what it was. It is a great comedy. I laughed with everyone else, and it was one of my favorites for 2014. We cannot expect that just because there was a controversy surrounding this movie that it's going to somehow blow our minds with its fantastic writing or something, but the actors were very entertaining and I quite enjoyed the plot in general. It was a lighthearted movie that people are being much too serious about. Take it how you will, but don't take anyone else's word for it.",The Interview
892,elmoatin,A waste of time,1,5 January 2015,"One of the worst movies ever..... I regret wasting an hour watching it. The movie has no substance what so ever... not a comedy as it stated and I am surprised it was even produced...... I guess the Sony hacking plot was the only thing that got going and after watching it I am not feeling sorry for Sony. The hype over the Sony fiasco was the only reason for people to watch it. The movie did not have a well structured plot and didn't serve a purpose. Now I think that the hacking was purposely done to market the movie. I guess no more sony movies for me. It's honestly just another ridiculous Seth Rogen comedy. Rogen and Franco are portrayed as American idiots who can't do anything right, much less pull off an assassination attempt on Kim Jung Un when they are tasked to do so after scoring an exclusive interview with Franco (for whom the North Koreans are huge fans).",The Interview
893,jimo_92103,Low Brow High Purpose,7,6 January 2015,"When I read the reviews that trash this film, it reminds me how clueless many Americans are and other western world folk. Yes, this is a Seth Rogan film with a lot of bathroom humor and idiocy. Yet, Seth manages to call attention to the oppressive,illegal, murderous regime of Kim Jong- Un by casting him as a someone who can pass himself off as a real cool guy while living a complete lie.The real Kim Jong cant pull off cool in real life but desperately tries to appear that way to his countrymen. The fake stores are a real lie that is no joke and Rogan is calling Kim out on it. The ""no arse hole"" thing is a real depiction of the false reverence that permeates the relationship he(Un) forces on his kingdom and minions. This movie is meant to call out Kim and the people of North Korea and the world to say enough is enough,lets start being real.I guess the low brow was too high brow for many people and they missed the point. Good job Seth!",The Interview
894,nicolasmaglieri,"Great movie, but not for everyone",8,6 January 2015,"Seth Rogen and James Franco have a specific style of comedy that may not appeal to everybody. As a fan of films like Pineapple Express and Neighbors, this movie exceeded my expectations. Given the recent controversy surrounding this film, it is easy to understand how people who may not have been fans of similar films may have seen The Interview purely because of current events and were disappointed. If you are somebody who hasn't seen a movie with Seth Rogen before, try Pineapple Express or Neighbors to see if you like this style of humor. Then, add that style of humor to a political satire and you know what to expect from The Interview",The Interview
895,Cameron1385,"Very funny, why bad reviews? C'mon critics!",10,7 January 2015,"I don't understand some of the critics of this site. 99% of them do not know comedy at all. I had to be married to any of them, it'd be like being married to a cat with no humor. This movie had many funny parts. It even told you the whole movie in the conference with Agent Lacey at the CIA headquarters (they go through a secret tunnel, Seal Team 6 rescues them and puts them on an inflatable boat). Overall it was a great movie. Critics, you really don't understand what humor is at all. Movies like Neighbors (Released as Bad Neighbours outside of the United States) and This Is The End got very bad reviews yet all still funny. People seriously need to find a sense of humor...",The Interview
896,CBunner23,"Expect a Seth Rogen comedy, and you will not be disappointed",8,7 January 2015,"Given all of the poor reviews, I went into this movie with low expectations. Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting much, but I found this movie to be absolutely hilarious. For one, the character development of Kim Jong-Un is impressive. Though subconsciously I knew the entire facade had to crumble, Randall Park did a fantastic job of ""honeydicking"" the audience and making Kim seem like an amiable person. Just like Skylark, I wanted to believe Kim was a great guy until his bombshell in the meeting with his military commanders and the subsequent fake fruit incident. And the comedic content is above average for a movie of this genre. Sure it is chalk full of purely inappropriate humor, like implying celebrity sex with a goat or conducting an overly long monologue on ""stank dick."" But it's the more outside of the box humor that kept me chuckling the entire time. The notion that an intimate rendition of an old pop song could unravel a ruthless dictator is both humorously absurd and outside the box.Overall, I really enjoyed this comedy. If you go into it expecting a serious film or a brilliantly satirical look at foreign relations, it's going to be a dreadful 2 hours. Unfortunately, the whirlwind press coverage led a lot of people to a movie that they were inherently not going to enjoy. But if you take this movie at face value, and come into it wanting to watch a Seth Rogen comedy, not that movie you saw in the news and are obligated to watch, chances are you will get at least a few good laughs. This movie is hysterical if, like me, you are the target audience.",The Interview

I cant say anything bad about this movie, i really am trying to pick something up and just cant. this movie is just a slap of awesomeness in your face. a kick of pure refined comedy in your nuts. go watch it, Now!",The Interview
898,tabascokiwi,A visit to the dentist is more fun,2,9 January 2015,"Given the quirky nature of the topic, I had hoped for something along the lines of Jack Black meets Flight of the Concords. Instead, Goldberg and Rogen handed the script writing over to a bunch of sweaty 14 year old boys sitting in a locker room that failed English class. Made worse was the fact that for some strange reason, Seth's character is a Jim Carey clone. Ouch! The synopsis of the film is great, but clunky handling of the story line, poor acting, limited vocabulary range has shot this movie down in a suicide mission. Seth and Rogen have shown us what NOT to do with a good movie plot. Kim Jong-Un, you can put your rockets away, I would get Sony to do the firing here.",The Interview

Great movie for it's category,10,9 January 2015,"Reading some of these reviews and I find myself looking for a pair of pliers to help some of these people remove the stick out of their ass. To note, I only made an account for this review because I was afraid some people may get the wrong idea about this movie. No, it will not win an Oscar, no it will not have an Oscar winning actor. Was Chevy Chase, Chris Farley, Eddie Murray, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, Bill Murray, Mike Myers, Will ferrel did a any of them win an Oscar? No, however were their movies not one of the funniest of their time? Exactly. Seth and James will not win an Oscar because the committee doesn't rate comical aspects. However this movie is hilarious. Without being one of the ""typical"" comedy type movies that have come out recently. It's different comical aspects then what has been common in movie cinema in the past year. Obviously it's a comedy, and in the category of comedy movies it will rank as one of the higher ones. When you watch this movie you expect that. It's not a Beautiful Mind or Titanic. It's a comedy, and a damn funny one at that. When you watch a comedy you want to laugh, and this movie will make you laugh. End of story.

901,fbfalkstein-209-938002,A worthless movie,1,10 January 2015,"It is hard to find the words to describe how BAD it is. There is one funny line that you can see in the trailer- when the CIA agent asks them to ""take him out"". Other than that the movie stunk. It was not funny and a total failure at satire. There have been many successful satires- Dr. Strangelove; The Mouse That Roared; Bulworth; Being There; and more. But this movie goes in the category of JUNK! North Korea is a repressive country and deserves a good satire. It has a wealth of satirical possibilities none of which were exploited by this terrible movie. Sony is lucky that it was not released nationally. If Sony had not been hacked, the movie would have lasted one weekend. Minus five stars!",The Interview
902,jackfisher2012,This film got the hype it deserved.,8,10 January 2015,"There is a high hypothetical bar set by the anticipation of watching this movie from the publicity it received. It is a type of humour where only people whom don't want to reveal the fact that they are human would not like. Laughs are guaranteed from beginning to end. It is rare that I would rate a movie so highly, but its slight serious undertone encapsulates the 'Western' view of North Korea. It is worth a watch, even if it is not your usual genre.It was a watch that comes with great apprehension, unsurprisingly regardless of this, it comes along with a 'Seth McFarlane' touch, the comedy, coarse in parts, was not without offence to at least one viewer. Whilst this is not particularly a bad thing, I cannot say that it is to the taste of every viewer, yet, what movie is? It's not quite 'Marmite'. You may love it, however if you do not, then you will take at least one thing from this movie. Must be watched with an open mind. -JD",The Interview

On what planet would someone allow such a thing? I'm glad to see American values still shine through. This is to you Seth, you are barely good enough to be allowed to grace a movie screen, but you suck at writing, producing, and directing, leave that to the professionals with whom sobriety and intelligence are not a scarcity. To you Franco, just quit, even under the direction of brilliant minds you still suck. You actually make Swartzengger look like an academy award winning actor. You really do ruin the moving, The Interview was bad enough as it was but you just drive it home with your BAD acting and not even remotely good portrayal of a TV interviewer. WOW you suck. Aside from those points, this movie is so unbearably bad that I insist Sony pay me back my money. I love comedies and I love a good stoner movie as much as the next but honest I actually would rather watch the entire Ernest goes to..... series of movies than watch this movie again. The best thing that ever happened for this classically bad movie was the attention garnered by the real Un and his midget minions.",The Interview

906,csj2332,Very funny movie unfairly overshadowed by surrounding controversies,8,20 January 2015,"""Haters gonna hate, ain'ters gonna ain't."" - Dave SkylarkLet's get this right out of the way: North Korea won't like it. I found it to be very hilarious. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg tend to pick the most heavy topic (In this case, attempt to assassinate the leader of North Korea) and create humor out of it. It's always fun to see James Franco as a really funny guy, and his chemistry with Rogen was fantastic. Some might find Franco a bit obnoxious, but that's Dave Skylark's (played by Franco) personality, which I thought it fit his character as a talk show host. Rogen's character is more friendly and a bit more serious, but still creates hilarious moments similar to Franco's. Randall Park, who played Kim Jong-Un, was pretty funny, too, and sometimes even brought an emotional side to his character.In addition to jokes and funny characters, the movie had impressive action scenes, quotable lines, and satirical moments that not only made fun of North Korea, but also the US and the media. Not only that, but it also touches on friendship and trust.The movie may not have been better than ""This Is the End,"" but it was still better than ""Neighbors,"" which was also good. I laughed out loud consistently throughout the film, and had a blast in the advance screening, three weeks before it came out on Christmas. Some might find the jokes offensive or gross, but what would they expect from a Rogen/Goldberg film? This similar expectation can be compared to ""Team America: World Police,"" (a generally acclaimed film with similar elements from ""The Interview"") and people knew what was coming. I've gotta say that most of these reviews here are highly overshadowed by the controversy. If this sort of controversy, like the hacking, happened to ""Team America,"" over-hyped people definitely would have said the exact thing similar to these reviews of ""The Interview.""I wouldn't really consider this movie as satirical. ""The Interview"" should not be taken seriously at all (which was what North Korea and GOP were doing), and be seen as another hilarious comedy movie, which I consider one of the funniest R-rated comedies of 2014.",The Interview

I'm into the opening minutes of this production, and I begin to think, ""This is going to be a good one"". After-all, Eminem gives us a stellar performance, at the onset. Hysterical one-liners delivered in a way that only Eminem can pull off.The remaining---the disappointing portion of the film, is ever-so slightly peppered with humor.

It's a well-done comedy that deals with the very real topics surrounding a totalitarian regime. Poe's Law: Extremism is often indistinguishable from satire. That's why I rated this movie so highly. A satire about North Korea is a perfect fit. The fact that this movie satirizing North Korea was met with such hostility from the Kim regime is icing on the cake. We see this movie as a fun way to spend a few hours; they see it as a threat to their power.Even without the political overtones, it's still quite the fun comedy. There was a scene that had me laughing me continuously laughing for well over a minute, which is way out of the norm for me.

I'm just glad it was free. It's two hours of wasted time that I can never recover.Without giving away anything, there were only two parts of the film which caused me to momentarily smile. The remainder of the movie was incredibly unfunny. I can't imagine what Sony was thinking when they read the script and paid money to produce and release this film. Perhaps they were thinking that movie audiences adore potty humor and incomprehensible idiocy.If North Korea decided to nuke the West Coast because of this film, I can't say that I would blame them.

Seriously, I do not agree with the way the country is governed, but this movies was extremely disrespectful in so many levels. I can not say the movie was not good because of the acting, the actors did a great job, it was the story that was messed up, it shows that the people that wrote this story have no limits.

I'm only 23, if this is the type of comedy I have to look forward to for the rest of my life, oh my! Don't waste your time! There is no talent in this movie. Its just useless and offensive non sense. Call me a Debbie downer, but come on Hollywood are you running out of ideas. Lets go back to meaningful actually funny comedies! That pretty much sums it up. Awful!

They were about as funny as a trip to a paediatric ward in a hospital. The acting was... The acting was...

If you still think you want to see it on the big screen, be prepared to view with a big chunk of artistic license, yes even for a so-called comedy.Even though I didn't think this film would be that great from the outset or even fall for the 'promotion', I viewed it with an open mind and hoped to have one good thing to say about it....... Eminem was good, he was a better actor than Seth and the other one put together. Oh and I think I mildly smiled at the part where Kim and the TV host were in the tank and were enjoying the spoils of NK.

915,throatbird,"Unfunny, forced, overly violent, but OK acting by Randall Park, Seth Rogen, and James Franco",4,16 February 2015,"Now, plain and simple, this movie shouldn't have gotten the green light. The premise is stupid, and above all offensive...and not that kind of laugh out loud South Park kind of offensive...its just offensive. The first 20 min. of the movie was promising, as I laughed many times throughout. The satire on the current state of media was actually clever. Sadly, the jokes grew tiresome as the movie entered its the 2nd and 3rd thirds of the movie. There was a scene in the second part of the movie about a bomb that Rogen couldn't place and had to stick in his ass. Really. One of the most tired excuses for comedy I've ever seen in a movie. He screams like a little girl as he sticks it up his butt, which is extremely annoying, and to top it off, he had to pull it out of a tiger. Really. Look, I'm all for slapstick comedy, but this bull. If the creators of this movie wanted to pull off a run of the mill slapstick comedy, they could've not made the main plot about killing a political figure. I'm sure that they worked hard on this movie, but please. Another thing I didn't like about this movie was the amount of violence in it. It didn't feel as light hearted as Pineapple Express or This is the End felt, as the violence was actually made to be serious in this. There was one stupid scene where Rogen ad some other guy were biting off each other's fingers, and it was incredibly weird. The amount of violence in this piece of crap was astounding, making the tone shift from comedy to action to shitty drama to comedy again. Not once had this film been a blend of each of those elements. The performances by Randall Park, James Franco, and Seth Rogen, but none were very good, and they all lacked emotion. Although the premise was entertaining enough and the three main actors were OK, this film gets D+.",The Interview

(1/2 for the bit where they bite each other's fingers off, and 1/2 for killing the tiger with the drone. Almost funny) I then proceeded to DEDUCT one star for every time the movie rode a juvenile butt joke. A total of minus 100,000 (or at least, it seemed that many. not even actually jokes, just Seth Rogan's non-acting dumb ass assuming it's funny to just SAY butt. I think he was attempting to play the straight man in this...he's such a total idiot you can't even tell...) There is no minus-100,000-stars rating, unfortunately, 1 is as low as it goes. It didn't earn even one star. It definitely OWES stars. The only thing sadder than this movie is the fact that people found it pleasurable, assuming they weren't just hired to write good reviews, which I find WAAAAY more plausible than that people could have enjoyed this total POS. The premise actually had promise, someone (else) probably could have made a funny out of it, despite the poor taste. In short, don't waste TWO HOURS of your time. Fart! Dick! Gay! Butt! Poop!

918,Slaterson420,It's just like every other Seth Rogen movie out there.,5,30 December 2014,"Look. Just forget the controversy surrounding this movie. This is pretty much the exact same shtick you see in every movie Seth Rogen writes. Now I think the man is a good comedic actor, and I like him in movies he doesn't write, like Knocked Up, Zack and Miri Make A Porno, 50/50 and even Neighbors. But when you view the movies he does writes, which even as a dumb pot smoking teenager I never found particularly funny, you start to notice a lot of reoccurring routines he uses. A homo-erotic bromance between the two main characters, a plethora of dick jokes, gratuitous drug use and party scenes, using random rap songs in scenes to make the movie cool while using random pop songs in scenes to be ironically funny, celebrity cameos, attempts at starting some sort of new trend that is clearly never going to catch on (in this case, the term honeypotting) and some violent action sequences just to keep things energetic, I guess. The only difference is this time it's set in North Korea, which I'm not really sure why they set the film in North Korea, other than to appear topical or to gather controversy. The film is no biting satire. It doesn't bring anything new to the North Korea discussion that isn't common knowledge, it doesn't have anything really to say about foreign relations, and it makes a statement about sensationalized journalism, there have been much better recent films like Nightcrawler and Anchorman 2 that talk about that in a much more insightful and interesting way. The movie's not all bad. Seth Rogen and his chap Evan Goldberg have an eye for direction, the film looks nice, Eminem was funny and some of the jokes get a giggle. If you're with a bunch of friends who really want to watch it, you won't suffer too much watching it with them, but don't seek it out.And I would like to add, I did not agree with Sony's decision to pull the film.",The Interview

The film starts as a mock up of a show in which 'news' is broadcast, regarding celebrities boring lives of which people are somehow interested in. Despite doing so well, Aaron (Seth Rogen) seems to be embarrassed as his intent was to work within the journalism sector, and a former pupil laughs when he insists that he is an actual journalist. Once the interest in the show from Kim Jong Un becomes apparent Aaron then chases him up to star on the show. The Central Intelligence Agency involve themselves and tell Aaron and Dave (James Franco) they must kill Kim Jong Un, they eventually arrive in North Korea to perform the interview and spend a few days with Kim Jong Un, whom honeydicks Dave who begins to like him and not want to kill him.",The Interview

It's so funny in fact that it almost seemed possible that this can happen in real life and if they didn't have the balls to joke about that stuff they would've been killed and happy endings like that won't exist.

921,monkeyhawkmyers,Comedy is easy. Satire is hard.,8,7 May 2017,"There's a lot of cheap jokes in this picture, then you realize that every character, every situation, every role, every issue is the butt of the joke. From the ""Entertainment Tonight"" TV gossip star to Kim Jong Un and everyone in between, the whole situation with North Korea; the set-up, the adventure, the peril, the rescue...they're all butts of the jokes. Not every joke hits home, but most of 'em work. And that's not easy.",The Interview
922,patrickcrlow,Well well well,10,28 November 2015,"Its been a while Franco, a while since I laughed at one of your movies. I've gotta say I thought Spring breakers was the best you were gonna come out with but you've redeemed yourself here.This is at least as funny as anchorman 2, but not quite as funny as Spring breakers,Im still waiting for someone to make some green goblin jokes so hop to it.Worth a watch though, im watching it again right now.If you ask me, playing spring breakers and The Interview back to back would be a worthy end to the Cannes film festival.Watch it, you wont regret it.",The Interview
923,webdesigndeals,It is what it is,6,16 May 2017,"I actually enjoyed this movie because I knew what to expect. It's a Seth Rogan/James Franco flick, so I just watched it to laugh and be entertained for a few hours. It worked for me. It is definitely not the best comedy I've ever seen, but It did have me laughing within the first five minutes.It has a plot that could only be conceived from a late night conversation and large amounts of Mary Jane, but the execution wasn't horrible.I think the people who rate this less than a five either have no sense of humor or they knew nothing about the movie going in. It's a silly comedy. if you're in the mood for a silly comedy, it's worth watching at least once.",The Interview
924,masa-33,not worth the while,1,26 December 2014,"Wooden and forced farce doesn't live up to the prime publicity North Korea has given this mediocre filmmaking. Oh wait, I see this is too short to be approved. May I say it again: Wooden and forced farce doesn't live up to the prime publicity North Korea has given this mediocre filmmaking. Still too short. Wooden and forced farce doesn't live up to the prime publicity North Korea has given this mediocre filmmaking.

925,sssmacarthur,Worth Watching,10,29 May 2019,I'm surprised at the low ratings for this movie. They should have gotten more credit for this. The movie is hilarious. Definitely check it out.,The Interview
926,joannmoss,Should never have been made,1,25 December 2014,"Utterly, pointlessly provocative, under the guise of free speech and comedic art. To Rogan, Sony, and all those who lent their names to this movie, you may feel proud of yourselves for all the free publicity and for ""pushing the boundaries,"" but to what avail? There were a few (sophomoric) jokes here and there but mainly I just kept shaking my head and asking ""why."" If the tables had been reversed and our own leadership was depicted in this manner, with similar consequences, how would we feel? To those who made this film, are you scholars about North Korea? Were you armed with a complete understanding about their circumstances before starting this venture? I am NOT defending their regime; I am only questioning the knowledge base on which this film was made. You may say this is fiction, not a documentary, but I say you used real names and places in a heated political environment, and you are very reckless individuals. There is a fine line between freedom of speech and provocative hate art. The arrogance and carelessness of this film leaves me speechless. Used to like ya, Rogan.",The Interview

930,shaneandersen-60797,"Good, funny, dont believe the bad hype",8,8 January 2019,The people giving anything under 5 have gotta be North Korean government personnel or hate comedy. This movies great,The Interview
931,wernutz,Great Premise Sounds Like Entertaining Stupid Fun,10,20 December 2014,"This is a great movie with a funny premise. It mocks an ugly human being who deserves to be ridiculed. Kim-Jung-Un is one insane nutso leader who deserves more than satire. A comedy movie mocking this insane cult leader, is the least harmful thing anyone can do to this evil individual. He is genuinely bat-crazy.This should be released already. The North Korean government or whoever that attacked Sony would do so regardless whether this movie is released or not. Not releasing this films is allowing these extortionist another victory. Sony should release it the damage is already done. Sony caving in to blackmailers does not ensure that the blackmailers will stop extorting the. Not releasing the movie will anger your customers. Caving in and not fixing your security problems will only encourage other groups to try to exploit and extort Sony.",The Interview
