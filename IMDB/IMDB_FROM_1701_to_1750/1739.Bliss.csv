0,SnoopyStyle,conflicted reality,7,8 February 2021,"Greg Wittle (Owen Wilson) is falling apart. He promises to attend his daughter Emily's graduation but his failed marriage is complicated. He is obsessively drawing to the detriment of his job. He gets fired and accidentally kills his boss. He escapes to a bar where he is confronted by Isabel Clemens (Salma Hayek) who claims to know the secret to reality.I really like the premise. I like the uncertain reality. Greg could start out a little more crazy. I like what it's doing in the first half. The second half does run into a few bumps. The scenes with Emily searching for her father should be cut. They indicate something which should not be indicated at that stage. Also the last act is not what I want. This movie is geared towards something darker although I can accept that filmmaker Mike Cahill is looking to make a different statement. All in all, I like the conflicted reality and despite the various bumps in the road, it's still very compelling.",Bliss
1,nogodnomasters,Technical Difficulties,4,23 March 2021,"Greg Wittle (Owen Wilson ) gets fired from his job, He meets Isabel Clemens (Salma Hayek ) who tells him a fantastic story of this being a Matrix type of world and only a few people are real. They take magic crystals that allows them to control the hologram people.I am not a big fan of Owen Wilson and he didn't impress me in this film. I didn't like his total lack of personality. Also I have a problem with two people sharing the same identical hallucination.Guide: F-word. Butt nudity.",Bliss
2,kosmasp,More or less than bliss,6,18 February 2021,"Bliss - something to achieve no matter what? Something to look forward to - something to really want and believe in, no matter if true or not? There are many questions in this one - many that can drive people insane or mad. What is true and wouldn't almost anyone want to have certain powers? But would they be real? And what could be considered real - there is not just one pill to take/swallow here but quite a bunch ... however you want to take that (in connection to other movies that had that as a theme).The two main actors are really good, but the flaws throughout and the fact that this does not seem to be sure what it actually wants to achieve, dampen the excitement a little bit to say the least. Still entertaining, but could have been so much more if it set its mind to it or dared to be more ... braven! Dared to challenge the viewer a lot more ... as it is, it is at least good",Bliss
3,classicsoncall,"""You killed a nice guy who let you wear the shorts.""",5,7 July 2021,"First off, who would ever name their company Technical Difficulties? Sounds to me you're only asking for trouble with a business model that's bound to dissuade potential customers.This starts out interesting but takes a mind bending curve when Isabel Clemens (Salma Hayek) enters Greg Wittle's (Owen Wilson) life. There's a whole 'Matrix' type feel to events that occur in the story where it intentionally blurs the distinction between the 'realities' experienced by both. The 'reality' is further enhanced by the appearance of hologram people who flit around at the edges of Greg's existence, complicated by his recent divorce, getting fired from his job, and his daughter's (Nesta Cooper) attempt to connect with him following a period of estrangement. Isabel's response to Greg's fascination with his dream world is that it was made possible via animation, synthetic biology, and asteroid mining.Depending on one's point of view, this will come across as a significant foray into a hypothetical world or a pathetic attempt to disguise a poorly constructed story as brilliance. It might even depend on the time of day you watch it or whether one is under the influence of a mind altering substance. I couldn't decide myself, although I know which way I'm leaning. I have to work through the technical difficulties.",Bliss
4,ferguson-6,"instead, check out Cahill's earlier work",4,5 February 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. We each have a vision of what our ideal world would look like. When we first meet Greg (Owen Wilson), he's working on multiple sketches of his: a picturesque Mediterranean villa and a beautiful woman to share it with. Greg seems to be escaping from a world that isn't so great. He's recently divorced, estranged from his son, and evades his daughter's attempt at reconciliation. He's also taking some type of prescription drug that he's clearly abused. On top of all that, Greg is supposed to be working his office job for a customer service company aptly named, ""Technical Difficulties"". The phone bank of employees are trained to answer each call with, ""I'm sorry"". At this early point, we aren't certain if this is a parody of office life or the set up for something else. Our uncertainty remains even after Greg has a disastrous private meeting with his boss.Things really get bizarre when Greg bolts from the office and into the local bar across the street. It's here where he first encounters Isabel (Salma Hayek dressed like a witch), who introduces him to the idea that this world isn't real. None of it ... except him. She has created a computer simulation of life and there are two pills/crystals for escape (this should sound familiar to fans of THE MATRIX). The yellow one allows Greg and Isabel to bend the laws of physics, while the blue one jolts them to the world that magically matches Greg's sketches. Like anyone with newly found superpowers, they head to the local roller rink, and take turns causing other skaters to fall until everyone else lay unconscious on the wooden floor. It's at about this point where I'm fighting the urge to give up on the movie.Writer-director Mike Cahill was behind two previous excellent movies that questioned our realties: ANOTHER EARTH (2011) and I ORIGINS (2014). However, this time out his approach is muddled and unstructured. It plays like a philosophical science fiction-romance, but we spend much of the movie trying to determine if the movie is too bizarre or not bizarre enough. A successful complex story will push us to buckle down and engage, but this one never allows us to connect with the characters, so we lose interest. It purposefully tries to trick us into choosing whether it's a computer simulation, parallel universes, or making a statement on severe mental illness. We don't have an answer until the end ... which would be fine were the journey more enticing.Asteroid mining, synthetic biology, and Isabel's ""Brain Box"", are given some credence thanks to cameos from Bill Nye (the Science Guy) and Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek. Ms. Hayek and Mr. Wilson, both former Oscar nominees, have little chemistry between them, and the film's best performance, albeit with limited screen time, comes from Nesta Cooper as Greg's daughter. By the end, we realize this was a convoluted story line for what was really a pretty simple explanation, and somehow we feel a bit cheated with the whole thing.Streaming on Amazon Prime beginning February 5, 2021",Bliss
5,deloudelouvain,Interesting story about addiction.,7,25 July 2021,"Well, I liked this movie. It's special. Not really a sci-fi movie, even though the drug hallucinations made it look futuristic. It's more a drama about addiction, about loss, about coping with pain, by escaping reality through drugs. The story is intriguing to follow in the beginning, you wonder what's happening, but I figured out the mystery pretty quickly but even then it was pleasant and entertaining to follow. Salma Hayek and Owen Wilson are maybe not the best actors ever but they have a certain something that is pleasant to follow. Owen Wilson was not always convincing, but on the other hand sometimes he was very convincing. My wife scored the movie a seven, I scored it an eight, but my wife is always right so a seven it is...;-)",Bliss
6,blanbrn,Changing lives and time a mixed sci-fi cult drama that's underrated!,8,6 March 2021,"""Bliss"" is one film that challenges as it goes outside of the box and may not be everyone's cup of tea still it entertains and shows that life is still choices and free will in the end. Set in L.A a repair company executive named Greg(Owen Wilson) has his life going no where as he's divorced and appears to be losing his kids and his job is close to getting cut. Only things change in a crazy way one day when time and change take over and get more dream weaver like when he meets a raw and exotic lady named Isabel(the beautiful and sexy Salma Hayek). Crystals and stones play a part in their game as it's like life now for the two is a sci fi fantasy. Things and people change along with time and places as memories can be placed forever and love and life all involves computers and programmed thoughts. Still thru it all the themes of choice, truth, and free will are present. Overall the film entertained and held interest as really it's one cult like underrated thought provoking film.",Bliss
7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Chasing happiness.,6,26 April 2021,"Though a lot of people are disappointed that it isn't really a science-fiction film in the way that some of its marketing suggests, 'Bliss (2021)' has pretty clear intentions right from the off and its small amount of ambiguity is either short-lived or extremely subtle (or both). It's basically an 'allegory' (technically the term only loosely applies) for drug use, abuse and dependency, with its lead character being pulled further and further into a dangerous delusion by a woman he meets in a dive bar. The movie tries to put us in the heads of its 'heroes', portraying their imagined superpowers as real world occurrences. It's not all that conceptually satisfying or, even, visually interesting, though, mainly because it sticks quite close to reality and most of it is shot with overly grainy, undeniably bleak cinematography. The only elements of the movie that aren't almost abrasive to the eyes are the ones that take place, essentially, inside the characters' heads. The problem is that these scenes are too few and far between for the drab look of the real world to be justified; you end up with a movie that just isn't nice to look at for, like, eighty percent of its runtime. There are also a few narrative issues, including some instances in which characters change their minds far too dramatically and far too quickly to be believable. Having said that, the film isn't bad. The performances are solid, especially in the storytelling moments that don't rely on dialogue, and the story is relatively resonant. It isn't told in the most efficient or, I suppose, engaging of ways, but it's told honestly and seemingly with the right intentions. Generally speaking, the picture is entertaining enough to see you through to its end. Though it isn't especially exciting and it does have its less successful moments, it's a decent effort that isn't afraid to try a few inventive things. 6/10.",Bliss
8,Cineanalyst,What if The Matrix was Boring,3,6 February 2021,"""Bliss"" has the ingredients of a low-stakes, non-action simulated-reality drama variation on ""The Matrix"" (1999) and similar movies--two worlds, fake and real people, central romance, superpowers, silly science-y explanations, drugs--it's just badly put together. It's poorly paced. Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek display no chemistry. The plotline with the daughter is even less interesting. And the drug addiction parable worse than that. The ambiguity of which world, if either, is real matters not, and either way there are shots that aren't apparently subjective from any character's point of view seemingly there only to mislead the spectator. Both worlds are underdeveloped, ugly and unimaginative in their own ways.One can see what the filmmakers were going for, because we've seen it done better before--not only ""The Matrix,"" either (""Dark City"" (1998), ""eXistenZ,"" ""The Thirteenth Floor"" (both 1999), ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001), ""Inception"" (2010), ""Source Code"" (2011), etc.). But, here, the sci-fi or fantasy elements are treated with less interest than family and lovers' squabbles and problems of mental health and homelessness. Social realism in a fantasy world. How dull.",Bliss
9,851222,An absolute mess,3,6 May 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Bliss"" (2021) is a one helluva mess. The only thing watchable in this movie was a likeble lead actors - they look good, they play good and you can see they had fun with their roles, especially Salma H. Other then that - there is absolutely nothing here to see. This is a one huge mess which i did not understood. The plot is a mess and it was told very poorly. Pacing was bad - at running time 1 h 43 min i was constantly watching at time of much there was left.Overall, ""Bliss"" is a colossal disappointment. I wasn't excepting anything, and still i was very disappointed. Avoid it, there are way many better movies to see.",Bliss
10,cruise01,Romantic mind bending film that falls into the bliss of pointless,2,9 February 2021,1 out of 5 stars.Bliss is a science fiction drama film. Owen Wilsons and Salma Hayek character meet and she tells him that they are in some kind of simulation. They can bend the rules with there reality.The film has a theme of drug addiction and feeling lost in your own reality concept. But the plot is poorly put together. The script fails to make the characters interesting. It is boring. The acting is a bit stale with Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek.Its a mind bending concept that fails to be something more. It loses itself in its own reality with twists that is not even interesting to keep the viewers engaged.,Bliss

14,Kdosda_Hegen,So underappreciated and misunderstood film.,8,10 March 2021,"Mike Cahill never seems to disappoint me so far. All of his works are very creative and thought-provoking.
This film is a truly awesome exploration of the human mind just like Enemy (2013) was, which is also an underappreciated and misunderstood film.
There are at least 3 ways to interpret this film of what is real and what is fake, there are tons of hidden details which give hints. There's also tons of funny references to popular culture and some multiple-meaning themes as well.
I say this is some fresh air in comparison to all the mindless films we get nowadays.",Bliss

16,lambiepie-2,"This is a Heartwrenching Film of Desperation, Not Quite Sci-Fi",5,17 February 2021,"Let me also join in and say as a marketer, this film's marketing was terrible. Totally gives folks the wrong idea if they're expecting a neat little sci-fi film.""Bliss"" is not a sci-fi film. It's not quite a fantasy film either. It is a film about designer drug addiction, homelessness, mental illness, depression, separation of a family. It's about a man played by Owen Wilson, whose whole world fell apart at once. He was already on the edge of everything: homelessness, drug addiction, etc.; as he's going through a divorce, his family was split. He loses his job and meets a real bohemian, homeless, street prostitute, drug addict played by Salma Hayek. She convinces him to take a synthetic designer drug and escape to a whole world where they are together is not the real world.The film's marketing makes you think this is going to be a kind of sci-fi/fantasy feature, but it isn't. Maybe the thought was to make it one, but it couldn't fit in the drug addicts and homeless as that took over the film more than ""the other world."" It tried - it tried. It started well - the twist with his boss was funny, and then meeting Selma's character in a bar and how she laid it all out had that sci-fi/fantasy promise.Then the movie goes into the homelessness and addiction and prostitution, and you get as confused as Owen's character, so by the time they get back to the sci-fi/fantasy element, you know it's a drug trip.There is no happy ending here. Just go in knowing this is another way to show co-dependency, drug addiction, homelessness, surviving on the street, period.",Bliss

18,TheTruthofItIs,LIfe in a simulation,8,17 February 2021,"Similar in concept to ""The Matrix"", this is a really smart take on life in a simulated reality, especially for a relatively inexperienced writer/director. The simulation mechanism (""the Brain Box"") has a decent plausibility factor which is certainly appreciated. Owen Wilson always seems to play these I'm-so-clueless roles so well, and Salma is in full stride with her latina accent, gestures, and mannerisms. One of the things to like about this treatment is that our protags get out of the simulation - no easy task - and then find the need to re-enter it, but only one can get out again. And this is ""the problem"" that's discussed in the story and why a story like this would make for a great 10-ep streamer, since the simulation mechanics are problematic and need improvement, an evolution that would play great over one or two seasons.",Bliss

20,Draysan-Jennings,Dull,5,12 February 2021,"The movie starts out ok then becomes lifeless. I turned it off a little over an hour in. About 30 minutes later I decided to give it another shot. Didn't work. I ended up turning it off again and then removed it from my watchlist. This might be Owen Wilson's worst film. This film had everything layed out. Fairly original story, great setting and A-List actors. Unfortunately, the editing and writing become boring and unimaginative. It's a basic 5 star film.",Bliss
21,natcalgary,Unexpected surprise that hits close to home for many,7,14 February 2021,"I went in knowing nothing at all about this movie. 10 minutes in I was very confused. Then as it progressed from there I thought to myself how the main characters in the movie reminded me of a close friend of mine who had a meth addiction for years and struggled to get help. They did an amazing job of showing the brain of someone who is going through this kind of addiction.It may not be a movie that the majority will enjoy, but for many they will enjoy sitting through this dramatic journey through the minds of a those inflicted with addiction7.4",Bliss
22,theknownames,Depending on who you are,9,10 February 2021,"So you have to go all in ( like with any sci fi ) sure, it's not total sci fi but there are elements also you may find this movie speaks to many things or aspects of self development.
While it looks like addiction, relationships, spiritual enlightenment matrix , really it's endless -when we saw the photo we thought zombie movie lol.
We also assumed laughs and hijinks considering the cast . At times it felt a bit oddly cast yet it felt like that was on purpose . They can certainly carry the picture actually they are a nice choice ; made it memorable and it was just another element of 'what is this'.?. it's not pretentious but it does go places .
I was against it early on but made a choice to settle in and just go for it . I found it to be quite lovely and entertaining . It's the type of film you don't want to know much about going in but coming out I have a newfound appreciation for the rawness of life",Bliss
23,jetkot,People rating it low did not understand the concept,9,4 March 2021,It was a brilliant film that pretended to be a science fiction. The science fiction was a metaphor for the bliss like state created by addiction.. Brilliant performances by Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek,Bliss
24,jwscott-home,I guess the younger generations have no ability to....,8,7 February 2021,"... focus on movies which take time to develop, nor can focus between tweeting and surfing on their phones and are unable to sit still and focus on the nuances of a film. It's reflected in movie reviews over and over, both by viewers and critics. And the young critics are the same. It seems there has to be something grossly action-wise, murder, vampires or flying marvel comic characters to impress these days. It's not enough to see a well acted deeper meaning movie.. it's frustrating that the intellect of those under 35 today is so scarred by the internet and its instant gratification, stupid exaggerations of life, falsehoods and just general detachment from reality. Most cannot sit still for two hours, so movies are now being reduced to 70-90 mins in hopes it can hold these information babies culture attention long enough to sit through an entire 2 hour movie without their attention span failing them. Having said that, this is a very good movie about two serious issues in society today. Excellent acting and very entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
It won't be long until we start seeing movies about the younger generations and their addictions to a false reality they believe in, created on whatever internet site or sites they're living in, each with its prevailing attitudes and false realities geared to addict these younger generations to a world that doesn't exist. Now then, it's a smaller percentage that get lost in these false narratives but it's large enough to create a significant population that's just living in a false reality, believing all the incredible garbage they read and teaching them to shamelessly promote themselves and their families in this narcissistic web creation Facebook and the like, which have fostered a new creation of people whom act as if they are just another corporate product being sold with the same marketing manipulations that we've seen the corporate world create for their products. They're becoming corporatized individuals, so caught up in the creation of their own marketing schemes of Thor own realities designed to 'sell themselves' not unlike the Geico, Bud Light, etc commercials that bore us at every place in media we look. And the foolish corporate entities actually use a review of these online 'realities' of these individuals to help determine the worthiness or hit ability of these 'made up' personalities. It's not about who you really are, it's about how well you can create a false narrative stating 'me' to make others think your somebody your not!
We've become a corporatized society. It's having a devestating effect on society. And a decent movie, to say the least, can't even be critiqued properly because of these devastating perceptions that are being created in which everything.. tv shows, movies and even a normal family have to be marketed to non realities for them to be popular.
This is a very underrated movie. But then you'd have to put your iPod, iPad etc in the off position and actually watch it to know that.",Bliss
25,faer_kr,Avoidable,1,6 February 2021,"Region 4 of the Matrix and Avatar.
Nonsensical science fiction with drama.
Without sense.
Quality.
Nothing has coherence. The situation is so unlikely that you do not know where it is at the beginning and the end.
He tries to explain an hour after the movie what is happening, but the approach is not even coherent.
It falls for all the clichés.
If you don't remove it before it's over, you've already done a lot.
The performances are.
It does not contribute anything although you want to see deep talking about the planet and what happens on it, as well as those memories that drag us.
It's about a man who kills his boss and a homeless woman helps him by doing magic so they don't frame him while taking power pills like Project X.
At the end and at the beginning they give you to understand that he is a drug addict who invents all that in rehab.

28,elliotte2,"Movie marketed wrong, not science fiction",5,25 February 2021,"First, this is not a science fiction movie, this is a mental health/drug addiction movie that has some fantasy sequences that appear like science fiction in the trailer.Acting was done very well, especially by Selma Hayak. I probably would have changed the sequences a little because once you realized what is happening the movie feels like it is dragging along. The director should have kept the audience guessing longer.There are a lot of Black Mirror resemblance(especially San Junipero) and even this feels like it would have been better packaged as a Black Mirror than a full movie.",Bliss

31,cordenw,It doesn't pass the 5 minute test,1,17 February 2021,"You can tell right from the opening scenes that this is going to be a stream of effluent..... and sure enough it is.Even though it wouldn't normally have passed the 5minute test, I kept on watching because it did have an aura of tension about it.But it starts with a typical non cinema streaming video ""woke"" theme with Daddy and his mixed race daughter going all out angst with her graduation ceremony where she plays the viola or the cello .None of these films ever shows the middle class ""mixed race"" family with a kid that emulates Nicki Minaj or Lizzo or 'Fiddycen'.No, they always have a kid who's next gig is at Carnegie Hall . Its just lazy assed reverse racist script writingOf course he doesn't want to attend the grad because he's in conflict with his Ex.And..... things go downhill from there, with all of the usual sloppy Prime/Netflix attention to detail, along with ham acting from all involved. Even Salma Hayek's beauty can't save this from the chair.From the early bar scene where the bartender lifts a new bottle of whiskey and then pours out from an almost empty one ( what happened to continuity?) it's obvious that nobody cares. We've got high profile names so who needs to think about quality ?With Prime's 50 million subscribers ( in North America alone!)paying around ten bucks a month (or maybe a bit more ) they've got 500 million dollars each and every month coming in, so what's $20 or $50 million , as long as we can say we got content.This sort of content belongs on a label of ingredients on the side of a ketchup bottle with a caution.....

32,Boristhemoggy,I watched it to the end as I had nothing better to do. But I'd not say I enjoyed it.,4,10 February 2021,"Owen Wilson is a cup of marmite. He is fabulous in some films and dire in others. I don't think he knows how to act, I think he knows how to be directed well. In this film he is not directed well.
Salma Hayek is vastly over rated. The only film she ever really shone in was Dawn til Dusk and that was because all she had to do was dance sexily, which lets face it, 95% of girls in the world can do.
Nesta Cooper was totally authentic and had me believing in her in every scene she was in. She almost lifted the film 1 star above where it would have been.
The plot? I don't think even the director knows. Is it a simple way of saying that drug abusers don't know what is reality anymore?

33,koofasa,Just a really bad film,1,25 February 2021,I've seen reviews that said the only reason people don't like this movie is because they were expecting sci-fi and this isn't a sci-fi movie. That's wrong. This movie is bad in all categories. The writing is especially bad as it meanders all over the place. The two main actors have done good work in the past and that's why I watched it but it was not enough. I hope they get better movies soon so they won't have to have this one as the last thing they did. Don't waste your time. Life is too short.,Bliss
34,WatchAndSmile,Very smart movie that takes you for an interesting ride! (explanation included),8,5 February 2021,"I can see how the trailer mislead many people and I can see how and why many didn't understand what the movie was all about. The movie is great, beautifully shot in every way and the story behind it is just amazing.SPOILER:The initial world IS real and the one where he was unplugged was not. The name Bliss and the blue crystal kind of hints at that since those pills are drugs, including crystal meth.
The reason they fell away from the ""bliss world"" the first time is because they did not take enough to overdose and stay ""there"" forever.
In the end Salma decided to overdose herself with her 10 pills and he decided to live here and then check into rehab. His decision is largely was influenced by his daughter as it helped him make all of those decisions.Brilliant movie and actually I figured it out only after I finished watching it.

35,Golden_Hope,Really Great Ideas With A Passing Execution.,7,6 February 2021,"This film has so many interesting ideas but i found that it doesn't really follow all of them though.I'm pretty confused at the low score and how badly it is being panned by critics.I thought the acting was pretty good and i was really interested in these characters. Which is where i think some of the issue are found.I think this film needed to take a step back from the sci-fi elements. They are very sparse but are there enough to hinder the true storyline. If i am being honest i think the whole 2nd act needed retooling. It was like a brick wall that the movie just slammed into. And then it just sort of slogged along. Once again i thought 'oh this is interesting' but then it just like stalled and i sat around thinking what is this movie now. It kind of gets its momentum back in the 3rd act but i think the 1st is where this movie shines.This movie is also great at visual storytelling. The production design, costuming and make up all work so well. It allows you to understand what the film is trying to say before the film explicitly tells you and i though that was really good.I honestly think this movie could have been great but it just got its self bogged down with the sci-fi part and trying to trick? the audience.I think it held its cards too close to its chest but i think the twist is blatantly clear from literally the first scene.

I think that would have been a much more interesting and very eye opening character and subject study.",Bliss
36,OneAnjel,Poignant Gritty Heart-wrenching,8,10 February 2021,"Some reviewers are mistaking the drug addiction here for mental illness or a combination of both. Sometimes they look very similar; sometimes one can lead to the other. But the refill he's calling for is Hydrocodone, which he's clearly addicted to. He goes to a rehab place later, not a psyche ward. This is an addict who was also on Methylenedioxymethamphetamine better known as Ecstasy, a word whose synonym is Bliss. That's the drug that causes delusions and loss of interest in reality when abused. One review claims that Bliss is a street name for Bath Salts, but actually 'Bath Salts' is a street name for synthetic cathinone which mimics Ecstasy. This film is about those who go to the other side of this drug and then make it back with a wake of damages. So, if people are asking for various parts of the film to be explained, I think that's all moot by the end. Other reviewers have commented that the marketing was off, which explains the low stars. Unfortunately, the production companies take whatever angle they feel will get the most wallets opened. I guess they underestimate the number of people who will find this a poignant, gritty, and heart-wrenching dip into the pool of addiction and its consequences -- and what that might look like to everyday people. In the end, I actually felt Owen and Hayek were simply not serious enough actors to make this film what it could have been, although they worked well together, I'll give it that. These major stars are both known for over the top action and dark comedy and it was hard to get past those well-worn brain paths to see them in something this serious. But having said that, I felt it was a great message film, well-done, visually entertaining, thought provoking and so I'm giving it 8 stars.",Bliss

39,therealjaysmoke,Could have been better but fell short.,3,20 July 2021,"I tried to understand exactly what was going on so many times and even read some reviews to try and make sense of it all.One way to see this is that Greg is a drug addict and the movie we are watching is predominantly (90%) inside Greg's head. This would have worked if only the director had revealed the true nature of Greg when some of these thoughts were happening on, you usually see this at the end of the movie then you can put things together with just that clue. Maybe he was high and in a trance. But this movie gave no such clues so you are left to figure that out yourself.Another way to see this would be that, Greg was delusional and he created the Isabel character. Everything else is real except for her. It would have been nice to see dual footages of him doing the same things he did with Isabel, but this time how it actually looked in the real world. You saw something like that in 'Saint Maud' at the end when she lit herself. But there was nothing either and just when I thought ok, we are about to get the big reveal when they were surrounded by cops in the end, and the daughter came, I figured the daughter would go to him, talk to him and because Isabel isn't real, she wouldn't see Isabel but Greg would be talking to Isabel and it would explain this two worlds that she spoke off earlier. But nope, the daughter was held by the police, Greg ran away and Isabel was arrested. At that point I was like nuuh, this isn't going anywhere.The movie then ends with no explanation whatsoever, you see Greg run to a rehab center, he is seated in a support group meeting and he says 'this woman claims she's my daughter and I believer her'. Then another scene later, he is giving his daughter flowers and hugging her. Movie ends.Total waste of time and opportunity.",Bliss

Magic crystals, an alternate reality, and telekinesis aren't exactly science.From a pure story perspective, some plot holes exist which take a lot of air out of this listing cinematic dirigible.Why does Isabel have total memory retention, but not Greg?
Why do they throw an interracial and bi-racial scenario into the mix?
Why the urgency to not get caught by the cops if they were just in a simulation that had a finite end?One has to assume that the entire story after the point when Greg gets fired is imagined by Greg, ya know - fantasy.",Bliss

Isabel wasn't meant to be real, but what if she were? What if that other world is real ? Despite knowing that it wasn't the intention of the authors, how cool it would be to get an ending with Isabelle in the perfect world?! I'd feel much better.Casting is off for everyone, except Owen Wilson. Hayek can't pull these roles no more, perhaps it's time to do something more age appropriate.

Both are thought provoking, original movies. Bliss is a Mike Cahill solo outing and it's unoriginal and forgettable. If Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is not classified as sci-fi, why is Bliss? Bliss' trailer is a fraud. It is not a sci-fi movie. It is a movie about a divorced man (Owen Wilson) who mentally checks out of life, gets fired, meets a loud, manipulative, mentally unwell woman (Salma Hayek) and escapes reality via drugs, hallucinatory (and meth, I assume based on their nasty teeth). He neglects his beautiful daughter who loves him, because he confuses reality with ""simulation"". He and his new woman have telekinetic powers without any logical explanation. It should be a trippy, wild movie, but it's one long bore of a movie. Midway, it goes into a long anti-oil speech and ""climate change"" rant. The movie ends and Owen Wilson's character is the same person he was at the beginning of the movie. It all felt pointless.",Bliss

52,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,Fails to prioritize its own concepts and muddles a great idea,5,15 February 2021,"Bliss has a fantastic central concept, but you'd never know until the movie was over and spent time making sense of its plot.The story starts simple enough. Greg Whittle, recently divorced and estranged from his daughter Emily and son Arthur, daydreams at work all day making sketches of a coastal retreat. Greg is called into his boss' office and fired from his job. During the process, from a miscalculated shove, Greg kills his boss when his head accidentally hits a table. He escapes to a bar across the street and meets Isabel, a homeless woman who then convinces Greg that he's a part of a simulated reality.Writer-director Mike Cahill packages Bliss as a quirky science fiction romance and gets so lost in its own world-building and logistics that the narrative entangles itself in its own confusing semantics.From its use of recognizable sci-fi tropes at the beginning, the film played like a lower-budget version of The Matrix mixed with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and a dash of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.The moment Salma Hayek's character enters the story, it had me mistakenly thinking the movie's theme was ""What is reality? What is real?"" And off I went spending much of the runtime deducing which reality was real or fake, following along where the film was seemingly leading me.The actual theme, what Bliss is truly about, is escapism, addiction and drug use. After seeing the film, I realized it wasn't really a science fiction film at all. It was a story about people escaping into fantasy, deteriorating away and losing touch with their own surroundings.I'd consider reassessing the film again if the script was better constructed and properly explored its themes. Even looking back now, Bliss never seems to dive into what it wants to explore. The actual experience was confusing and plodding and not in a fun mind bending way akin to seeing Christopher Nolan films. Instead, it felt like work.It's easy to see why the two leads took their parts. You could see what they were both shooting for, acting wise.Breaking out of his own shell, Owen Wilson gives a raw performance which sheds the ""Wow"" astonished Owen Wilson character that he is popularly known for. He's taken off the usual comedic layer and bares a lot of vulnerability in the Greg Whittle part.Salma Hayek has always had a propensity for quirky and comedic parts, even though that's not what audiences tend to associate her with. Whether it is broad comedy like in Grownups or satire like in Dogma, she shows a hunger and a determination to tackle the oddball parts. Hayek achieves that here as Isabel, who in a better-executed telling of this story would be a much darker character. This left a lot to be desired.I wished Bliss was clearer from the get-go. I hate to point out that Bliss is an example of what not to do to filmmakers even though the attempt is still admirable. There's a great story in here to be told but the storytelling needed to get its priorities straight.",Bliss

58,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,"Boy, Isn't Ignorance Bliss and Reality A Nightmare",7,6 February 2021,"Welcome back to Stream to Big Screen! As the youthful year gets going with promise and poise (anything has more promise than 2020), streaming sites are becoming ever more full of content. This week I was able to watch, Bliss. So let's see how two of Hollywood's darlings fared in this otherworldly time spectacle.In this Prime Video streamer, we follow Greg (Owen Wilson), who is struggling with his marital/family situation and issues at work, when he meets the mysterious and captivating Isabel (Salma Hayek). Who isn't captivated by Salma Hayek?! Am I right or am I right? Anyway, Isabel is a woman living on the streets and convinced that she's polluted and broken the world around her. You can say her powers have them in a ""computer simulation"". Matrix vibes anybody? Anyway, Isabel and a skeptical Greg figure out that maybe she's not as crazy as she appears. I know what you're thinking that this sounds quite interesting and in fact this is remotely original. And, boy, do I enjoy originality. The most original part of this is making Salma look ordinary. It took some effort to make her look like a weird off the grid lady, but really it just is too, too much hair and extra baggy clothing. Either way, even though I thought the pairing of Wilson and Hayek would be weird, they actually worked pretty well together in good roles for them.On top of that, I enjoyed the message that viewers derive from this film. The filmmakers definitely touch upon a world we live in but don't want to see. The subtle differences in reality for people in homes and those on the street can be ever so slight, but we all need help. Life is hard and can be even harder with mental health issues or drug dependencies. We all deserve love and for our loved ones to care about and for us. Nevertheless, I enjoyed how the movie teetered between reality and fiction as I can imagine it does for many people struggling with issues. There needs to be better efforts to help our dependent communities. *steps off soap box* Which world is real? We may never know but either way the set design is great in both.Bliss sparks a bit of bliss in the Prime Video catalogue. Original, a bit off the wall, weird, and corny but different in a good way. The pairing of Hayek and Wilson really makes this movie have feeling. The unbelievable couple makes this movie feel real. While ignorance is bliss, Bliss provides insight into the divide between communities and the idea of us all wanting to chase bliss. Feels a bit long but grab a nice bowl of popcorn and enjoy this Prime Video streamer.",Bliss

It's the kind of film you and a friend can watch and have a totally different take on at the end and the debate for hours which only makes it more fun. There is one tiny clue, right at the beginning that seems to make the director/writer hang hos coat on one of the hooks a little quicker than the other. Again, that may be just how I see it.

And the acting is also very good.People speak of mental illness like it's a simple thing to define. because traditional judeo-christian mythology of a heaven and hell and all layers of places and beings makes perfect sense!... Alternative beliefs brought about by drugs, shamanistic and recreational, do tend to step on this blurry line though. The line off what is real from what isn't... And so yes, this movie IS about drugs and shifted perceptions.To say it is about homelessness is to have no idea of what the reality of being homeless feels like, and to say it is about drug addiction again implies one has no idea what that actually feels like or looks like... This movie represents none of the actual trials and tribulations of those realities. These characters dance through existence like little snowflakes in a storm.This is more about an attempt at genre mashing new age simulation theory stuff with the hard knock life of reality by a writer who never struggled a day in their lives..And yet I still give it a high rating. because it does what it sets out to do very well.

In his hallucinations, he believes that he is a scientist testing a neural machine that enables people to experience the worst to enjoy the ""perfect"" world. Well, it seems that his vision of the worst is having two colored kids, getting a divorce and lose his job.Did the writers notice this racial overtone or was it made on purpose to show how racial prejudice can reflect on an interracial family ?

Both Hayek and Wilson are actors that I can truly appreciate and the synopsys spoke to me, so I gave it a try.Overall, it's a good story. I can see what the writer(s) tried to conceive and everything has a smooth and etheric feel to it. But the movie as a whole lacks excellence on so many parts, that it's hard to rate this higher than a 6. Hayek and Wilson create believable characters, but they both lack true depth and this keeps the emotional hook below par. But it also might have had to with the script. It just lacks depth and it didn't capture me completely. Like it tried to hard to be ""arthousy"" and this comes for the biggest part to the surface in the ending. But... if you're looking for an easy, romantic tale with a twist into spirituality, then this might be a good choice.

But don't let that appearance fool you: She's actually a scientist - with cool science stuff like ... thought visualizers ... and brain boxes. And there's also a lot of drug-taking and neurobiology and dialogue that feels like it was written by an algorithm.In one scene towards the end of the film Owen Wilson randomly picks up a rock, looks at Salma Hayek and asks her to crush his skull with it.

Casting of Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek are perfect for their roles, and the ending is thoughtfully poignant.Bliss is criminally underrated based on the reviews I've seen so far.

There are a couple of things that let you believe it's all in his mind but some are just not explained away that easily. I'll have to watch it again and see but if this isn't scifi then the director/writer did a poor job of getting that across because the scifi part was pretty plausible.
And all those holier than thou cause I ""know"" about addiction and mental health issues can shove it. I've been involved with bothjunkies and the mentally ill. Personally and professional for close to 40 years. There are things in this movie that just aren't congruous with either of those. The scifi view is plausible and some of the Holo versions of his daughter don't fit into the other world or the other world's story.
So I'm going with the he stayed in the brain box and she got out. Prove me wrong. But I will say I really didn't like that the writer or director didn't feel comfortable enough with his work to just tell us at the end. I hate that crap.

Bad marketing.,8,5 February 2021,"The way you react to this film depends on how you view two things: Drugs and Homelessness.The trailer is very misleading as you may accidentally mistaken it for a sci-if thriller. It's not a thriller and can be very disappointing when you go through the film at first. Whoever developed the trailer did not market it well and is very upsetting.
But if you sit back and experience it with no expectations, the film is actually very good.
Our two main talented actors do a really good job of portraying these unique character and really give you a sense of who they are and what they are experiencing.
As of the time of this review, the film was just recently released and already is having mixed reviews. It's a story inspired by real situations told in a unique and thought-provoking way.
Which is why it really depends on your thoughts and views on the real world issues this is based on. It may come across as controversial in some ways but speaks some truth that isn't spoken enough about in the mainstream.
The ending was super good and doesn't leave you upset or unsatisfied like some films like to do.

NOT.If one pays attention you can clearly hear the main character use his credit card to crush and then snorts the pain medications he's been prescribed and then the weirdness ensues right through to the end when his partner in psychosis bites it and he goes to rehab.This is a antidrug film thinly cloaked as a scifi reality bending flick. A careful watching of this film and you will see that this is what the film is about. Basically, its about a guy who is a druggie who hooks up with another druggie in a bar and together they use crystal (meth?) to experience prolonged periods of psychosis.It would have been better if it was true to the marketing.

It's about drug addiction, the mentally disabled, and homelessness. The moment I recognized this, I had a better impression of the movie. Having a career in LE in a city I experienced many with those difficulties. It's easy to criticize the homeless or dismiss them, but if you had a better understanding of the issues they're having mentally your feelings would change.

113,indialm,I had no idea,3,9 March 2021,"As a few have written here already, this is a film about addiction, albeit in a new, different and if you have not been personally touched by addiction, confusing way.
I also thought this film was a Sci Fi comedy about different realities akin to ""The Matrix.""
It wasn't until I began reading the other reviews that I realized it was about drug addiction. In this regard the filmmaker made a lot of assumptions, first and foremost that every viewer would get that the main character, played by Owen Wilson, was fighting his drug demons starting when he is snorting his pain medicine. (And once again the world is fed the false narrative that everyone taking an opioid must be abusing it, thus causing a lot of distress, hurt and potential to commit suicide for people suffering with chronic pain.) And this is the difference between those who suffer from addiction and those who are dependent on ANY medicine. The addict cannot function, as others do, in this world we live in without breaking laws, some social, some literal.
So I didn't pick up on the ingestion of little blue crystals as anything more than something as in Alice in Wonderland and NOT crystal meth. Even to the last frame did I never make a drug connection. If I had, I still would have watched the film, but wouldn't have sat there, as my companion did as well, never making the drug association. I'd suggest to future filmmakers to not assume your audience knows the world you are portraying and that it's your job to give them the information they need so they do.",Bliss
114,sydnee_man,The worst thing about this movie was the marketing.,8,9 February 2021,I was really excited to watch this film. I love sci-fi and I'm a big fan of both actors. I was looking for something fun and quirky but that's not what it is. About 15-20 minutes into the film I had to adjust my expectations. I had to shift my thinking from sci-fi to drama because that's what it really is. *SPOILER*It's a drama about addiction. A lot of people probably didn't realize this because they've never had to deal with a loved one that has addiction issues. Unfortunately I have and I saw all the signs. I understand why the writer/director wanted to leave it up to interpretation but I think that just led to some confusion - especially for people who don't have any experience with an addiction. I also think there's a bit of mental illness in there as well and that fits because a lot of people with mental illness self medicate with illegal drugs.All of the haziness occurs when people are coming down off their high. During their highs everything is blissful - or so it seems. That's the only thing that could explain why people would hurt their families - especially their children - so much.I think it's a worthwhile movie with great acting. I think people will enjoy this more once they adjust their expectations.,Bliss

Bliss is street slang for bath salts and bath salts describe over the counter powder drugs which give you halluzinations but also have terrible side effects, not only to your brain. The main protagonist, played by an excellent Owen Wilson, made the wrong decisions. He lost his wife, his family, his job and is now homeless and a drug addict.This movie is a work of art.

136,fits-47019,A good story idea hampered by unnecessary sci-fi elements.,2,8 February 2021,"They could have done so much more with so much less. The whole sci-fi part of the story was completely unnecessary as far as Owen Wilson's character and his relationships and figuring out what was real and what was imaginary in his life. They did not need this alternate 'matrix' type dimension to blur the lines between the characters being genius scientists/doctors/homeless people with mental issues. Also Hayek and Wilson have zero chemistry as love interests. The whole romance angle felt shoehorned in. They could have scraped half this movie and told a simpler, more impactful story of a man with a faulty brain trying to hold on to what he loves regardless of whether or not it is real.",Bliss

140,klperkins07,Mind blowing - tough pill to swallow,10,7 February 2021,"The movie itself is great and kept my company and I guessing the whole time at the edge of our seats (bed lol) what's real? What isn't? Ar the very beginning before he leaves his office to talk to his boss, they quickly show the rehab place and if you pay attention to his wallet on his desk, it kind of glitches and disappears. He's clearly on a medication (maybe) and couldn't get his refill and that's when his reality becomes distorted. Maybe those weren't prescribed to him or he was abusing the drugs or taking more doses then recommended (sounds like on the call he ran out sooner then he was supposed to or got more refills then he remembered). From that point what real in his mind and isn't is a mystery to me.Knowing that he's mentally ill and on drugs makes the skating rink part more intense. Why the woman was judging him or shaking her head and then the chaos he must have brought thinking it was ""powers"" or they weren't real. There's a point when leaving the skating rink, he and Isabel steal some hats and coats and are outside the rink and he watches himself get arrested and then who we thought were them were actually other homeless people. That was a cool visual to me and imagery.The daughter especially is very important and it may take a watch or two to pick up on everything. I applaud his daughter and her persistence in not only trying to help her father, but also being patient, loving, understanding, and accepting of him as well. A lot of the brother's and sisters dialogue make it clear the dad has some kind of problem for a while. It's not the first time and is something that's been happening. Pay attention to when he's buying the food and the son sees him and ignores him, the cashier's reaction to it all when he orders and doesn't have the money (call back to the opening with his wallet in the desk), very telling this man is delusional and out of touch. Most addicts always have excuses for their use, from what the son said it seems like maybe pain pills. (Also, notice the change of clothes and his look and the reaction of his coworker when he leaves the bar the very first time when he thinks his boss is dead, think the daughter calls back to that when she later in the movie says he's been seen panhandling outside of his job again. It could be implied at least 2 weeks have gone by that he and we are unaware of since he misses the daughters graduation).The trailer was very misleading and even the taglines/ description when I googled before watching penned this movie as a sci-fi esque love story. There are elements of science and the story is fiction and scene that display a live interest, but this here at its core is a deep dive into mental illness, drug addiction, and the distortion of reality from the combined of a troubled man and his love with ignoring reality; living in a state of Bliss (see what I did there lol). Drugs / an addiction so powerful that it persuaded him his own daughter wasn't his and questioned her reality.I watched it twice and appreciated the movie more knowing what I was actually getting. Every line or action has a purpose once you understand the true meaning of what's all going on.",Bliss

It's clear this film is reaching for Memento, Mulholland Drive, Fight Club and Jacobs Ladder style, but in the movies above they resolve the hallucinations, ambiguity and confusion either by wowing us in the end to where everything all the sudden makes sense or the take us deep enough into their art that leaves reasonably entertaining symbolism open for interpretation but not too much that would compromise the theme of the story.Unfortunately Bliss lands more firmly in the uncooked scrambled egg and spaghetti territory. The story just concludes with far too many unresolved areas where at the conclusion only a few parts of it fit, but it gets overwhelmingly slaughtered by the parts that don't... The theme of the story interestingly and clearly we'll established in the first 5 minutes is left entirely orphaned by the rest of the movies artistic freedoms and psychedelic tangents.I vigorously paid attention for 1.5 hrs so I'm hoping to be rewarded with surprisingly magnificent and wise clarity at the end that allows me to resolve 80% of what happened...Be smarter than me....

It was none of those, not even close. The entire marketing staff should be banned from ever working in the film industry, what an unbelievably skewed representation of the movies actual content.It took me quite a while to figure out what was really going on in this movie, and I'm sure if I was aware at the start, that this was going to be a dark, depressing movie about drug addiction and mental illness, I would have been able to watch it through a different lenses.

They made it out to be a really cool sci-fi movie (and it could have been one) and then midway through the movie they show you that you are watching the hallucinations of some drug addled people.I'm guessing the marketing people guessed (probably correctly) that few people would watch another version of Trainspotting no matter how good the CGI so they intentionally mislead potential viewers to bait them in. When I realized that I had been duped by the hype my first comment (In General Akbar's voice of course) to my wife was ""It's a trap"".That, alone, would not have earned such a low score from me. My problems with the movie were: 1) PAINFULLY SLOW!!! They dragged out scenes for far too long without adding value to the story; and 2) They didn't sew up a lot of loose ends so you were left wondering if you even understood the movie. Maybe the producers thought they were leaving it ambiguous so that you would think about homelessness and addiction but honestly it looked like lazy writing and sloppy editing.Mr. Wilson and Ms.Hayek gave good solid performances. Their acting was earnest and believable. But everyone else around them (Writers, Editors, and maybe Directors) did a half-a$$ed job.",Bliss

But what the movie needed some kind of closure. But it didnt! If i read the high reviews which praise the movie of portraiing loosing control, becoming homeless, addiction and mental illness i was suprised. With this argumentation i also can say Harry Potter is also portraiing mental illness , harry is only imagining becoming a wizard becaus he is abused by his uncle who put him living under the stairs!Nope its not a good movie! Nope it is not good in showing what is reality and whats not! You can say its a scifi experiment or you can say its about drugs and mental illness!If this was the intention of the filmmaker, fine!

My take on it Is that Hayek represents and embodies Wilson's addiction, an exciting and captivating temptress into another world. The dreamy scenes depicting ""bliss"" are in stark contrast to the numbing brutality of ""real"" - beautifully executed. The attempts by the daughter to stay in her fathers consciousness and bring him back from the brink, endearingly heartbreaking...If you've ever used drugs in more than a passing acquaintance, you'll surely understand and relate to the irresistible world of the imaginary over the dreary reality of mere existence...Brilliantly played by both leads.",Bliss

166,malcolmwrites,A Well-Meaning Little Brother,8,13 May 2021,"The well-meaning, slightly imitative little brother of Terry Gilliam's ""The Fisher King,"" ""Bliss"" is a decent movie and definitely worth a watch. It tries hard and really wants to find new and clever ways of living up to the excellence of its older brother. And it really does come close.Honestly, all it suffers from is poor casting and an understandable inability to reach the impossible heights of the epic, Don Quixote-inspired ""The Fisher King.""Owen Wilson can't carry off manic or depressive half as well as Robin Williams does, and Selma Hayek is too spectacular and ethereal to plunge the depths of loneliness and isolation that Amanda Plummer reaches in Gilliam's masterpiece. (And no one in ""Bliss"" can hold a candle to Jeff Bridges or to Mercedes Ruehl, the latter of whom scored a well-deserved best supporting actress Oscar for ""Fisher King"" in 1992.) Both films contain excellent, interesting, and intriguing metaphors for homelessness, emotional despondency, poverty, drug abuse, and the schizophrenic mind. The writing here is strong, although it might have been better served sticking entirely with Greg's POV. (Showing us what's happening outside of his world/worlds also has the unhappy side effect of removing us from his tragic but captivating orbit.) As long as you go into it knowing it's not sci-fi but is instead a film about pain, loss, and the tragedy of the dissociative mind on individuals and families, you'll likely come away with a slightly broken heart but also with an enjoyable cinematic experience to reflect back upon. I'm giving it 8 stars, which feels about right. I could go as high as 9 if pressed or as low as 7 if I were in the mood to nitpick. Either way, imperfect casting aside, it's worth a watch.",Bliss
167,biffpsych,Unexpected Surprise,9,16 February 2021,"After watching the first third to half of the movie wondering how the hell the couple were going to break out of the cyber world and step into the beautiful Greek or Riviera scenery in the trailer, I realized it was not going to happen. Frustrating, but oh my gosh did they seem to nail the problem of mental illness and how it can spiral into drug addiction or vice versa. I often deal with those who are drug addicted and suffer from mental illness. Listening to them, it is clear that their reality is not the same as mine. To see this from their point of view (as best as can be done on a screen) was very powerful. I hated it. It was ugly. It was painful. It was sad and depressing. There is no other way to portray it and it was done magnificently. Owen Wilson and Selma Hayek; wonderful performances, no surprise, but the crown jewel of this film was Nesta Cooper. This was the first I had seen of her and she was fantastic. She is what made this movie moving and hopeful and inspiring. Too often families abandon those who are afflicted or give up on them (to illustrate, there are 40,000 unidentified deceased people in the U.S.). Not judging, I cannot imagine the difficulty in dealing with such a situation. I wish there was an easy answer to the problem. As a father though, Cooper's performance moved me to tears at the end. When she said ""Daddy"" with that smile backed by unconditional love for him it was beautiful. I have never seen a more convincing performance. I seriously would nominate her for an Oscar.

This is clearly done to make you as a viewer believe in the things the main is experiencing.

There are some gems of clues hidden everywhere in the movie. Fi. People appearing multiple times (a glitch in the Matrix ) somewhere in the background....
However, some of the clues pointing to the actual story were just way to obvious. Not subtle enough. In the first minutes of the movie you see the rehab centre, you see him crushing pills.... Because of this I already figured out the movie was about drugs at the moment the crystals came into the picture. Which is a shame.... It would have been amazing movie when you as a viewer would remain blissfully ignorant and would actually be sucked into the fantasy/psychosis of the main character believing it's real with him. But since the clues pointing towards drugs were just not subtle enough that didn't work. Still it's a hell of a ride, this movie. It deserves more credits than it's getting from most. Just like that other movie in the same category, also with a brilliant actor most people only know as this comedian: Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.People giving this movie a low rating should definitely watch it again.

And the soundtrack was very fitting.This is one that I think will garner a following, similar to Another Earth, its a big premise done on a small scale and overall it works really well. The mind bending scenes bending worlds is actually pretty impressive for a film that has a relative low budget for a sci-fi film.For fans of Another Earth, Mr Nobody and Coherence.",Bliss

193,upthetoshy,Nothing is as it seems...,5,25 February 2021,"'Bliss' may appear to be just another movie unceremoniously cranked out by your second-favorite streaming service, but this is not the case..After careful inspection, I've concluded that Salma Hayek must have taken a bunch of ritalin and watched the 'Universal Remonster' episode of Aquateen Hunger Force, then, duly inspired, bribed the studio to film her running around obnoxiously ad-libbing her hair-brained tribute (substituting 'the brain box' for 'the fargate' and 'the thought visualizer' for 'the universal remonster').Owen Wilson tries valiantly to prop the whole thing up, but repeatedly winds up confounded and befuddled.There are some cool moments and some nice cameos, and, in truth, 'Bliss' does touch on some interesting/though-provoking concepts, but all-in-all, the film manages to fall way short of the mark (coming across as melodramatic when it tries to be quirky, and convoluted when it tries to be deep).It's probably worth the watch if you have some time to kill (I've honestly never seen anything quite like it, for better or worse), but if you're anything like me you'll probably find it somewhat frustrating and obtuse.5 stars seems fair here (once again, if everybody is just going to give 10 stars if they love something and 1 star if they don't, why not just change the rating system to thumbs up or down?).

In case you prefer movies about questions like ""what makes you happy?"", ""do you need a perfect life?"" or ""is the visible reality all there is?"" this movie is for you.Personally I really liked the ambiguity hat made you always wonder whether it's just a dream, insanity or a simulation or not.

196,robbenn69,Not at All What I Was Expecting,4,23 August 2021,"The ads for this film on Amazon Prime imply that this is a Sci-fi film about alternate realities, similar to ""The Matrix."" Regrettably, this is not that film. It is not a Sci-fi film at all. Admittedly, the busty and beautiful Salma Hayek attracted me to watch this film, and she does look beautiful even as a homeless woman. But I have never regretted a decision more, having watched this turkey.SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON:Salma Hayek is addiction personified and it is a good part for her to play because I would never have watched this film had she not been looking sexy in the beautiful surroundings of Split, Croatia, where this was filmed. It looks like a beautiful Greek island or the Amalfi Coast in Italy.The movie is about the sordid world of drug addiction, in particular crystal meth addiction, mental illness, and homelessness, from the users point of view, I suppose. Bill Nye the Science Guy has a funny cameo in the film as both himself and a fictional version of himself. The film's pace is very slow and uninteresting until Salma Hayek enters the picture. After her arrival, the pace picks up a bit with plenty of boob shaking action from Salma as she runs around a lot in a tank top. Despite this, the picture is just awful and depressing. And with all the money he has made, why can't Owen Wilson get his nose fixed? I couldn't take my eyes off of it, it's distracting.If you were looking for a brilliant Sci-fi film about alternate realities, do NOT watch this film. It is slow moving and as dry as a peanut butter sandwich on toast without any milk to wash it down. I cannot believe after all the hits these two actors have had, they did this piece of crap.

212,aboettinger1,To all of the people raving about the message...,5,6 November 2021,"Sure, it could be viewed as a metaphor about mental health and drug addiction. Where it fails is in its handling of such subjects and the need to present itself as a sci-fi, parallel universe thriller. There are far too many plot holes in this juggling act for it to be viewed solely as an unreliable narrator, drug hallucination, even if I were to grant that approach.It starts out with Greg, the lead character, accidently killing his boss. Nobody knows he did it, yet there was someone in the next room when it happen and they knew he was there. Obviously, if this was all in his head and it never happened, that isn't a problem. But to anyone watching the movie, it looks really stupid because SOMEONE KNOWS HE KILLED HIM.From there, the character makes far too many irrational decisions to even make it a remotely engaging film. If you make it to the end of the move and think back, the choices become a bit more understandable, if not rational, depending on how you view the story.As long as this is a drug induced hallucination, I guess the story makes sense.

The film never tells you what it's about, it makes you use your brain to think and talk about what is happening and what did happen. We both worked out what the underling story was but there are so many questions you think and rethink after the film's finished and that's what I love about this film, it's not easily forgotten but I do want to see it again.

The cherry on top for that kind of audience is Slavoj Zizek, the man who somehow convinced the unwashed masses that he is (actually) a philosopher. His cameo in this movie serves as some kind of poetic justice because his intellectual potentials perfectly match this movie's value.

It doesn't do a good job with either of those elements at all.
I usually really enjoy the acting of both Salma Hayek and Owen Wilson, but not in this case. Owen played a version of Hansel from Zoolander if his modeling carrier hadn't worked out and turned to made up drugs. Salma... I can't equate this to any other character she ever played.

I liked the first half hour or so of the Matrix but thought they'd horribly screwed up the rest of it.This film is AWESOME. People who don't like it, basically have no imagination. I can't say too much or I'll spoil it, but what other film would have Owen Wilson (Zoolander, Loki), Salma Hayek (sorry, not a fan so I don't know), AND cameos from Bill Nye and Slavoj Zizek?!?In a way it's the anti-Matrix. It asks questions about interpersonal manipulation, addiction, mental illness, and simulated reality in ways that other films don't even begin to consider. There's a scene where you think ""Is she gaslighting him? Is this what's happening?"" And then you go ""OK, fine, so that explains a lot"", and then you're right back to the start! Somehow it shows you the mindset of a messed up junkie AND the mindset of a spoiled citizen of a futuristic utopia - and they're both equally real!If you're not a complete moron and you like simulation movies, go out and watch it, but if you're a basic betch and just want to watch stupid hackneyed Hollywood capesh*t, don't bother. Peace out!",Bliss

I watched until the end b/c I had no idea what was going on & I was curious, even though, through most of it, I wanted to vomit. Then it ended without explanation. What a waste of time. Everyone involved in this mess should be embarrassed.",Bliss
255,mjanelle-24974,Can I get those two hours back?,2,11 February 2021,"OMG what a horrible movie!! I liked the premise (when it finally got there), but it took so long to get there, and then they did nothing with it. On the strength of Selma Hayek and and Owen Wilson, both great at what they do, I stuck around hoping that it would get better. But NO!SPOILER ALERT:
The beginning of the film felt a little like a Cohen Brothers movie, bungling deus machina like the dead boss's weight unhooking the window latches he's been hung to so that his body falls four floors down making it look like a suicide, the raving lunatic the protagonist meets in the bar across the street. This had all the makings of a great movie (like if the Cohens had made Dogma, or even the Matrix). But it soon devolved into some kind of odd pseudo psycho psoup. What's up? What's down? Which world is real? Which is not? It might have made more sense if the action had continually moved back and forth between the two worlds.The idea of drug addiction (and the delerium that comes with withdrawal due to Wilson's character being unable to refill his pain prescription) is toyed with throughout the movie, first by Wilson's character, then through conversations with his supposed children, giving impetus to the idea that the ""real world"" is made up, and the ""Matrix-like"" world is the actual real one.So I guess it's up to the viewer to decide which is which and what it all means.Unfortunately, this movie didn't make me want to care either way.",Bliss
256,manyhobbies,Actually pretty good,8,17 February 2021,"Okay, it's not perfect, but I actually really enjoyed it despite it's "" The Matrix develops mental health issues"" side, and I reckon Owen Wilson did a fine acting job.
My one huge gripe though is that, as far as I can see, there is no acknowledgement of the 1981 Robert Carey novel ""Bliss"" although it is dead obvious that this movie was inspired by it, and in fact there is already a 1985 Australian movie of the same name which was a fine interpretation of the book.
In that regard this movie stinks, but as a standalone bit of cinema it's pretty good.",Bliss

I guess the synopsis and the trailer created the wrong expectations. When I read the bad reviews I see that this is the problem. People expected something completely different and got frustrated, most of them even gave up before figuring out the real meaning of the story.I gave a chance despite the low rate, but I must confess I was annoyed for the greatest part of the movie. But I'm glad I finished, because it made me admire the whole concept much more and create my own theory.It seems crazy and non-sense but it is actually touching and deep.",Bliss
259,suzidap,My theory (who is with me?),10,4 April 2021,"Ok, now a review with spoilers. My theory is: Isabel doesn't exist. She is the human representation of the drugs. And once you have this is mind, all the alleged non-sense starts to make total sense. She appears when he is desperate, offering some magical help, they suddenly get close, because of her he loses his phone, his money, steels a car, ends up living on the street, going to dangerous places, having trouble with the police. She takes him to that dream world. People are debating which of the worlds are real, but the ""perfect"" one never existed, he was allucinating and woke up when he listened to his daughter.He even suggests that Isabel kills him, but when he is determined to stay in the reality, she disappears.Isabel is the drug.",Bliss

261,vibrant_visuals,ABSOLUTELY DEPRESSING!!,5,5 March 2021,"First off, I wanted to watch it because I thought it was sci-fi! I had no idea it was about addiction! Watching these people completely spin out of control is just so depressing! The reason I didn't rate it lower than I did is because the challenge figuring out what's really happening while they're in ""bliss"" was a trip! You slowly realize you're seeing the same places and things (skating rink, statues, etc.) in the real world, but ""beautified"". It's a constant edge between the two worlds. The scary part though, is I've had issues like this without drugs; due to my mental issues. So it was pretty disconcerting to be able to relate and actually *having* to take meds to focus on one world. 😔",Bliss
262,brassackwards,So close to being great but fully mediocre.,3,15 August 2021,"This movie leaves you with more questions than answers. And not in a fun mind bending way that's cool to talk about. It's just a lot of, ""if this was so, why did that happen? And if the opposite is true then this other thing doesn't make sense."" It feels like the script/story needed another draft.Many people here seem to think that this is a movie about addiction. I think it makes just as much sense to believe the brain box and the world above it were real. Why the glitches in the simulation and the rehab center that keeps showing up as if it's some feature of the simulation? Why no consequences for the crimes committed and no later explanation for what actually happened during use of their powers? What was happening when he crushed the van? Is Bill Nye showing up at his current age in what was supposedly the future supposed to be a clue that the ""real"" world was a delusion? Why knows? Who cares?Overall, this was mostly just disappointing. And the whole way through, I kept waiting for it to get great instead of just chugging along in mostly mediocrity and ending in confusion and dissatisfaction.",Bliss

This is the first film that makes me understand and not feel so... Forgotten...or unloved back by them when they are in the depths of their addiction. Why it's not a 10.. unanswered questions. Did his boss die or not? What happens to Isabel? One can make assumptions of both but I like solid answers.

Just on originality alone this movie is at least a 7 and then there is the performance of Owen Wilson, I just didn't know the guy had it in him, he is very VERY good in it. Going from Wedding Crashers to this performance is quite the leap and he does it successfully. Most movies on this SUBJECT (I don't want to give anything away) are usually slow and depressing.

275,Arcturus-Tarf,ACTING WAS GOOD BUT...,1,9 February 2021,"In my honest opinnion, best thing about this one is the acting. How he staggered after getting out to show us he is not there.The story is flawed, It is just ""Here I give you this and you will believe.""

The acting is very good, nothing to say about it.The story itself may require to be watched twice to understand exactly what it's talking about (blue meth as blue cristals).

It's almost as if the writers are trying to convey some sort of deep, dramatic, and conflicted emotional experience, but I'm just not feeling it. Owen Wilson and Selma Hayek were grossly miscast for these two characters; although, I am not sure I would recommend anyone take up these two roles. I hope they both made some bank on this film, otherwise they would have done themselves a favor by passing on this one, They're both great actors, but the story (if you call it that) was not right for them... or anyone for that matter.

And all of those factors (our own mental health, social reinforcement and a way to enjoy life thru a substance that a trusted person gives us) can cause an overdose. And that overdose feels like complete bliss. All the while, not knowing that in reality we are destroying our lives, end up homeless, breaking our relationships, negatively involved with the law and thru all that, still have no cure for the mental problems that started the cycle.I imagine he was in complete, but experience an incomplete, form of bliss.

It is a story of a drug addict's descent into mental illness.It is however a very good movie. We see the world from the point of view of a man with severe schizophrenia. There is no simulation. There is no other world. These are constructs he has created in his own head to make sense of his drug use. We also get to see the borders between his reality and actual reality crack and break.

301,SuccessLocksmith,"Unexpectedly Good, luckily not blissful",7,6 February 2021,"Apparently this dropped today on Amazon Prime, and I just noticed it on the Fire TV.The basic idea, which you can see in the trailer, in part, very similar to the matrix, but takes a different approach.The premis, that our protagonist is living in a simulated reality.In this treatment of the narrative, the real world is the ""too good to be true"" version, and to exit three simulation, you need to ingest colorful crystals.
This is no action flic, don't expect ""The Matrix"".It's far from perfect, there are quite a few plot holes, but nothing bad enough to ruin it (at least for me). The performances are solid, and the pace is right.The daughter character is great, and I always like Owen Wilson (although I know some don't). Salma Hayek is Salma Hayek (not bad, but an uneven delivery)The story works, and I think we get to share the feeling of wonderment and anxiety when dealing with a world we don't understand - wether a blissful one or a wretched one.If I would philosophize a bit, this movie gives a perspective into depression, with a (pretty obvious) hint of drug abuse.I think might find it not dark enough, but it is in no way a ""light watch"".7 out of 10 seems fair.

If you are trying to fit it in a matrix-style sci-fi box, you've missed the point. It's about the subjective experience of mental illness and the absolute reality split that is experienced by the person, while their loved ones desperately try to reach them. Its about the person giving their power away to another person, allowing their psychological boundaries to be crossed, because that sense of reality was extremely fragile to begin with.

Most homeless people turn to bond together and create their own families, may even turn to drugs and live in this wonderland. There are so many matters to take from this movie.

I was fascinated, then confused, then enlightened; only to be left what in the world was the true meaning of this film, once the ending credits started playing.
I really didn't know if the intent wasn't Sci- Fi, or a story of a down and out man who, due to being down on his luck was lured into a horrible drug habit while being convinced that these drugs would give him special powers and could take him to ""the real world"" ( which was an alternate and beautiful place).I wouldn't discourage anyone from watching, as a matter of fact the film is lost in translation so much that I think it promotes worthy conversation over drunks with friends.",Bliss

1) originality: 9/10
2) acting: 9/10
3) script unpredictability 9/10
4) length of the movie: 9/10
5) overall movie 8/10I find it hard to give it less than 8/10 stars...this is better than Tenet or other movies that one way or another we ALREADY SEEN. This movie is ORIGINAL my friends.

What a pathetic profession. I've Assumed that they've somehow accumulated taste and knowledge of what a good vs bad movie is. Because of this I've dismissed many 5.3 rated movies (or lower) for higher rated ones. Some go as far to say mean things like, don't waste your time watching this POS movie. I wonder; are they actually trying to help me, or hurt someone else? This movie showed me that they, kinda like some of the people in this movie, aren't ""real"". They lack imagination, depth, and compassion. They may also not know what it is or means to struggle, or to be able to put their feet in someone else's shoes. Not that this movie needs it, but if you try, you can appreciate any movie if your mind is open. Well, maybe not all, but many.

338,ffyrestarr,As this a sci-fi or drug addiction?,7,15 February 2021,"Ok. So firstly I'm going to give my impressions then I'm going to comment on some of the other reviews...The actors are excellent. Always knew Salma Hayek and Owen Wilson had real depth as actors just not usually able to show this in their usual comedies. Great to watch. They are the main characters and the only ones allowed to show real depth.The way the film gears up to start with has a almost Matrix like scenario of falling down the rabbit hole and turning your prescription of the world upside down.Then it goes kind awry. The yellow crystals seem to enable Greg (Owen Wilson) to affect people in an almost telekinetic way in both worlds. The hints seem to say that the ""bad"" world is the ""real one"" but then where's the explanation for some of the things he does - especially the gang in the van. I suppose he just went psycho on them and the people at the skating??But he's clearly in a addiction meeting near the end... But there is no clear indication for what is actually real.The ending left me very unsatisfied. I do not know if I'd rather it was a sci-fi as it seemed to be advertised to be in the trailer...So according to a lot of the reviews this is a film about meth because of the blue crystals. I suppose there are some clues with the rehab centre etc...but makes me wonder what the heck the yellow crystals are a metaphor for - violent craziness?Almost definitely a film about choosing your reality but then the mental health metaphors others have wrote about make no sense as you cannot CHOOSE not to have a psychosis. It's an illness not a lifestyle choice.Maybe it's about how you choose to deal with mental health issues. Either just wanting the fantasy to be real and taking drugs to ride the waves or dealing with real life head on because their is some good things there.Changed my rating from 6/10 to 7/10 just writing this. Definitely a film you have to think about but still feels... Unfinished.",Bliss

This is enjoyable on so many levels, it has its mind-blowing dose and it's this is the type of movies that you could watch more than once because of that. Leaving out the photography, cinematic and al technical stuff the critics review, the story makes you wonder if we are actually in a simulation (like in The Matrix): and/or makes you wonder how the characters looked to others in ""the real life"" while they were on trip or what was ""actually"" happening vs what they saw. It makes you think and question and create theories... (Like in inception). Also, it can be interpreted from an interesting point of view about mental illness (like shutter is and addiction point of vyou have to ask to yourself how does this movie makes me feel (that's the purpose of art isn't?

I got to free fall without care and as I journeyed with the film I never forgot about the beauty of my own personal life. My experience was enhanced with my own understanding of contrast.

This movie is a gritty look at those suffering with mental health issues who turn to drugs to cope.

This is a great movie, whose average rating should be around 7.2/ 7.4. It's unfortunate that even so-called experts critics are not getting it. There is no science fiction at all...!! so stop complaining about the complexities of not understanding which world is real, and which is not, and whether there any scientific basis for Isabel convoluted explanations. It's a simple but artistically filmed story of one man who becomes an addict (there is no need to go for that story, but be sure his mind has not been in a good place for some long time). That man has found a woman with her own mental and addiction issues, who also happens to have a more lively imagination and stronger personality. Estranged from their families, they struggle, and find solace in tripping and escaping to an orderly, peaceful, beautiful place, which they called and would love to be the real world; the addict alternate reality. The trick is that once you realize that they are both creating their own world, you have the director permission to imagine what is the reality behind all of this, including what might really happened when they use their so-called superpowers. Lovely finish; one that many who had similar family struggles can relate to, while others may be living with the hope for, at least, a late arrival of their own flowers.",Bliss

He end up homeless, his drug addiction drove him into virtual reality world where everyone live perfect live, even met his love who actually may not be even real or beautiful, possibly just another junkie taking drug together.
This is maybe not the Matrix or Inception but will leave you thinking which world is real. This is enough for me to give 10 of 10, same like Matrix, Inception or Donnie Darko - all those movies left me thinking long after finishing watching them.

My explanation,8,6 June 2021,"My explainationI think that whole movie is a hallucination of Greg.What is real is the beginning of the movie where he talks to his daughter and then gets high. ( pay attention to credit card that he pulls from his wallet and the movie color changes while seeing the window) . He is then apprehended by police and placed in a police car. Probably because he is high at work or did some felony
In his hallucination , you see him as a homeless guy looking at himself in a police carHaving Super powers all make sense if it is a dream.Also the bliss world is part of his hallucinationAt the end you see him running to a rehab center. Well that's the beginning of all.

It makes me think that people can't think outside the box; that they were not able to make an accurate connection between the events in this movie and the altered mental status of a hardcore addict who suffers from cognitive distortion and other mental symptoms caused by excessive drug usage. This movie used symbolism in an ingenious way. If one analyzes this movie, one can see the correlation between the specific events and the effects certain drugs have on the mind and body. Those who gave negative reviews are probably interested in a movie that is black and white, not gray and abstract like Bliss. Kudos to the writers for such incredible creativity!!",Bliss

I'm glad I did. My brother was an alcoholic and a drug addict for the better part of 13 years, starting not long after he graduated high school. He had long a beautiful seasons of sobriety during this time. But most of these years were ruled fraught with relapse, jail, court, broken hearts, and cautiously optimistic hope.In his last trip into the land of bliss, not long before his death, meth had truly taken him to different worlds, though I must say here that none of them struck me as anything more than a nightmare.I'm not sure that the world Jason sought looked like the one in this movie, but I know he first traveled there to escape the pain he felt deep inside. Loss of child hood friends, contemplating his own identity as an adopted son (With us from birth mind you), and the battle in his own mind as a baby carried to term by a drug addict herself.Along with my tribute, I'll add that I'm grateful to have seen a glimpse of what his world might have been like. It was terrible and helpful. This movie is unsettling every step of the way if you love someone who is or was battling an addiction. You'll probably only watch this once, or maybe never. But there is no doubting that it was a worthy venture to tell a difficult story that resembles the lives of those trapped by drugs and maybe even more importantly, us who live as ghosts in the lives of those we love. Sorry to anyone else who knows this pain.Love you. Miss you. D.",Bliss

417,yufrsq,Mesmerising Movie. Criminally underrated.,10,21 February 2021,"An amazing movie on so many levels. One of the best, if not the best to be made in the last 12 months.Before my main point, I would like to commend the acting of Salma Hayek and Owen Wilson. In regards to Wilson this is a change from his usual and he was truly magnificent in this movie. The supporting actors were also excellent, a very well cast movie.A poignant heartfelt depiction of the human need to escape suffering. The plot is ingenious and I have a new found respect for Amazon for making such an intelligent movie in the modern cesspit of mindless action copycat dross. They must have known it risks being misunderstood.It's always felt strange to me that someone would rate and review a movie low stars simply because they don't understand it. This implies that movies should descend to the mean, which logically is a spiral to the bottom- because aiming for the mean to get good ratings drives the mean lower etc. Instead we should have the courage to pull humanity upwards thus evolving as a species.This requires those who don't understand to abstain from judgement. If Einstein's theory of general relativity was judged based on the ability of most people to understand it, it would go down as one
of the worst theories ever imagined.I ask you to watch this movie with an open mind, allow the ideas to sink in, without premature judgement.
If you don't really get what it is trying to say about the nature of human suffering and really on the nature of our reality and how we relate to that reality then please abstain from reviewing.In so doing, we can encourage film makers to aim
High when deciding which movies to produce.
Thus benefiting humanity as a whole.",Bliss

It was never made clear what the 'truth' was. Which world was true? That's the sci-fi part. It's a very layered and esoteric movie with many hidden gems for thought. How did the boss die and then come back to life? What parts were real and what was constructed? Just like life today. Are we really free or do we just think we are? This was a very beautiful movie actually. Depicts our world perfectly. Fake people, fake narratives, tons of sleep walkers that are easily controlled.

His likeable, laid back persona makes this character all the more tragic, believable, sad, but his transformation both in physicality and behavior just blew me away. I know Salma Hayak is known for her comedy but in this, she's dramatic, crazy, scary... really a testament to her acting skills.But the set design, the continuity of scene in the two different worlds.

The descriptions I read before I watched it were pretty accurate in terms of these two characters trying to figure out what is real and what is not real in the world around them.

I watched the movie without any sort of description. I had no idea walking-in. What I do appreciate is the movie is unique. I'm tired of regurgitated storylines that don't require you to think.To the people disappointing that it's not a sci-fi movie, well it can be. I read a few reviews that said it's portrays communism. However, if anything it's completely contrary to communism. When you look at it from the sci-fi perspective of the future utopia it actually digs deeper that our lives would be meaningless and boring without friction. What makes life worth living are the struggles we face. Without struggle, we inevitably become bored and lose satisfaction with living. That idea is contrary to communism and is one worth thinking about. We always talk about making the world a better place: but what if we fixed every issue? What would we do then?The addiction aspect is one that I kind of saw without knowing what was going on beforehand. I believe it's a great analogy to the life people live addicted to drugs. He was making the world in his own image and the drug was the only thing there to help him with that. Many often wonder why people addicted to drugs cannot see things for the way they are, especially relationally and when it comes to choices. Well, who is to say that someone homeless on the streets that's addicted to drugs doesn't see this kind of world?The movie was very well acted. The visuals were great and the storyline was unique. It's worth watching!",Bliss
469,ryanbmadsen,The real meaning of the movie Bliss,10,26 February 2021,"This might be the best movie I've seen in years. When I looked at Rotten Tomatoes, I was shocked by how many reviewers ""fell for"" the movie's red herring sci fi side plot. Even with all the clues the movie gives throughout, some reviewers really thought that ""bliss"" might actually be the ""real world"" in the movie's premise. In a sense the director Cahill was almost too effective. His point was to pull readers into this concept of ""chasing bliss,"" which is not only common of drug users and certain mental illnesses, but frankly any of us when we use delusion to cover our eyes in the face of the harsher aspects of reality.Based on watching the movie a few times, here are a few conclusions. Feel free to let me know where you disagree.#1 You see the Safe Harbor Rehab Center billboard occasionally appear. Those are each decision points for Greg. When it fades it means he is engulfed in the delusion and when it appears it signals hope for a pivot.#2 Isabel is about 95% made up. She was a prostitute who Greg ""messed up with,"" leading to his divorce from his wife. Pretty much the only time anyone else even acknowledges her is when she is talking to the other prostitutes. There's a big clue dropped at the end about the origins of Greg's delusion about fake vs real when Isabel hits the other girls in the chest saying, ""Fake, fake, fake"" then pointing to her own chest, ""real!"" This mirrors her statements to Greg about how everyone else is fake. Any scene showing Greg talking to Isabel, we can essentially imagine Greg talking to himself.#3 The ""bliss"" world is entirely made up. There are endless clues for this. First, all of the ghost like people are the ones walking around back in the real world while everyone else is part of Greg's hallucination. Also some of the idiosyncrasies of the world scream delusion. Like the ""Thought Visualizer."" It's really a dumb idea, but one you could see a drug user really running with. Another example is ""Doc Henry"" who supposedly started mining asteroids and passed out a half million a year to each person. The scene of him handing out money was the exact scene Greg had experienced days before when a kind worker at a fast food restaurant handed him a bag of food. The name of the restaurant? Doc Henry's. There are many others like the Bill Nye character was the leader of a protest he had seen days earlier on a television. In case anyone missed the point, the scene later with his daughter makes clear that his delusion cannot hold back reality from trespassing. The sound of the train makes clear he's back in his tarp tent talking to himself.#4 There is an obsession in the movie about the right number of crystals to eject from the fake world. Clearly the sentiment of the addict who feels they have come ""so close"" to truly escaping the illusion.#5 The movie has a big focus on science saving the world. This is one of the most fascinating themes. It essentially shows how science can be twisted to justify this delusion. Ultimately it isn't science that brings him back. Instead it's his emotional connection to his daughter. This isn't a criticism of science, but rather a recognition of its limitations.#6 Reality has to be chosen. It is not as compelling as we make it out to be. Reality itself cannot be ""proven."" Yes it's persists but it must be chosen. The second to last scene beautifully captures this when Greg says, ""This woman says she's my daughter, and I believe her.""This was a beautiful movie masterfully directed by Mike Cahill, and acted by Owen Wilson and Salma Hayek. It definitely should be nominated for movie of the year, but that won't happen as long as critics think it's science fiction.",Bliss
470,pokemonyellow,Bliss: When your thoughts and feelings are disconnected.,8,20 February 2021,"After seeing the IMDB rating I was skeptical about the movie, however I had nothing better to do and was pleasantly surprised by what I witnessed.Some consider the movie to be a metaphor and/or commentary on addiction, while others consider it to be about mental illness, and so on, however, try watching the movie from this perspective:There are two worlds, the real and the unreal world. The real world was once filled with suffering, just like the unreal world, but science saved it, by automatizing everything thereby giving free time to humans to explore their passions, art, etc. instead of fighting over resources as quoted by Isabel (Hayek) ""We went from a broken world to a beautiful, sustainable, safe, peaceful earth"". In the unreal world there is Greg (Wilson), who is suffering (recently divorced, no refills available, fired from the job, accidentally kills his boss; boy that's a bad day), is approached by a Isabel who is currently doing a research on making people more appreciative of the planet we inhabit (real world), by making them experience suffering, which is echoed in her quote ""It's amazing how easy humans can get used to even something spectacular. Most people say, ignorance is bliss, but I say you have to experience the good to appreciate the bad"". The error in the last line could be indicative of Isabel not completely knowing what she is doing.And so Isabel may be telling the truth (and hence the sci-fi element), about the blue crystals being able to transport individuals from the unreal world to the real world, and people who had become grumpy, unappreciative of the good that was in their lives, when experienced the unreal world, they would come to appreciate the real world again. There are some ways in which the error in Isabel's understanding manifests as a side effect of the experiment on Greg, where he was supposed to have a change in his state of mind (which indeed does happen), the change is not in the direction Isabel expected. Greg has fatherly feelings for his daughter. Then Greg's daughter showing up due to the glitch of having taken less than the recommended dose of the blue crystals, and so elements of the unreal world could be super imposing themselves onto the real world. This being the reason behind Greg and Isabel going back into the simulation (unreal world), so as to exit the unreal world without bringing its elements into the real world. Due to the inadequate dose, and Greg's experience of using the yellow pill in the real world during the scene when the unreal world is beginning to superimpose on the real world, along with his daughter's words ""One of these days, you're going to have to choose between these worlds, and maybe, somehow, to you, they're both real"", makes him realize that whether real or unreal, both are a feeling, and so if he feel she's his daughter, then it's real. This is hinted upon in the contrast between views Isabel and Greg share on bliss, where Isabel says ""Bliss is not a feeling. It's not a place. Bliss is a state of mind that can only be achieved by understanding the contrast with the opposite state of mind.' , while Greg's description of bliss goes something like this, ""I have a picture in my head of a place. Home. A woman. I don't know if any of it's real. But it has a feeling, and the feeling's real.""And so he chooses what he feels over what he thinks, and prefers to stay back in the unreal world with his daughter than go back to the real world so as to save Isabel.All in all, the story line is quite brilliant, but the constant shifting of the real and unreal perspectives makes it tedious for some if not most people to feel comfortable about the movie while connecting the dots it leaves a trail.",Bliss

Some people watching the trailer or movie may not immediately realise the protagonist is experiencing an acute psychotic episode.

I've worked as an adult mental health nurse for almost a decade and sadly for many of my patients their lives are often blighted by drug addition and homelessness.

That said, its some of the most solid acting I've seen from Hayak or Wilson, and it doesnt' deserve the poor critic reviews its recieved. This is a film that will leave you with more questions than answers, but if you're the kind of person that can appreciate a work of art over a linear narrative- which is what director Carhill is clearly trying to achieve - than you'll enjoy this.

That being dragged out of my deepest hike of my soul, and as a Millennial dealing with 3 Generation Z's, i have to say that I totally agreed with almost all reviews said and done, and to capture attention of this almost completely robotic, antisocial, self centered, extremely fragile and even mortally ""touchy-feely"" in all aspects and stages of life and if not timely corrected may be left ending to an auto destructive Generation, I have to say that you don't have to be a rocket scientist to predict an even more destructive brutality extremely gross chemical synthetic human-beast drug made addicts, due to the psychological effects of a completely society isolation that it's being a new ""normal"" rule at all aspects of a daily basis, from a Stay at Home Mom to a CEO of a neuralgic technology worldwide company. This isolation aka virtual reality is the most dangerous ways of life if you don't have the strong mind and psychological abilities to perform an hybrid healthy balancing virtual and present lifestyle.

507,jumpingshipz,Another piece of hollywood mental programming,3,30 October 2021,"For any critical thinkers out there, it should be pretty plain to see that movies and Hollywood are used as predictive programming to seed thoughts and ideas into the population such that when these idea's become the norm or reality, the mind is already prepared for this, it's actually a form of black magic on a population that helps creates the unfolding of a new reality paradigm. If there is a particular trend or societal ideal which the global elite are pushing humanity towards, you can rest assured it will be reflected in television and media and painted in a positive light at the expense of the old system which is being torn down and stripped asunder. There's a problem with this however: the new system while technology superior almost always comes at the expense of stripping away your freedom of self determination, your rights, your personal governance and what would be considered 'moral & just' and replaced with a version that gives more power to a centralized few that believes they know better than you and have the right to rule, whereas you have a right to exist only if you play by their rules.So, what morally bankrupt cow dung do we see being shoved down your throat in this movie and painted as the solution to the worlds problems:1. Replacement of humans with robots.2. Virtual reality simulations to take you out of the real world and into the meta world which shuts you out from the realities of what is being done to you and the world around you. Ie this world sucks so let me escape into an artificial construct.3. Gene editing as the solution to solving disease. Nope. Most disease is a result of toxicity in the body from modern living, the food we eat and the toxic garbage we breathe and slather all over ourselves as part of consumerism. 99% of what science tells us is caused by gene disfunction isn't. That's marketing speech to sell you pharmaceutical drugs and keep you sick into perpetuity. We have known cures for most diseases on the planet through natural wholistic solutions but the general population is taught from birth to believe otherwise. Think in this case of mRNA vaccines as the solution to a made up pandemic that you are more likely to get struck by lightning than die of.4. Universal income (socialism) as the solution to global pollution.If you follow what's actually happening in the world, the rollout of the The Great Reset, Build Back Better and the Green New Deal, how utterly amazing that the script of this movie uses the central themes of those globalist plans as the solutions that made the real world into such a wonderful place.The production company of this movie is called Endgame Productions. You can't even make this up. It's just blatantly in your face and marketed as entertainment so that you socially accept the atrocities being committed and to come down the line.Have you noticed that old movies had a sense of wonder and magic about them that seems replaced with moral degradation, blood shed and special effects?So this movie is more of the same.",Bliss

This has been read as some kind of Matrix-style fantasy, whereas it is quite plainly a Gilliamesque fable about mental illness and addiction. The casting is a little odd to make that work entirely, although I think Owen Wilson manages to turn in a performance that transcends his standard shtick. Salma Hayek struggles to makes her subpar material work, but Nesta Cooper is never anything short of compelling.

518,mixer-909-815552,Sci-Fi Fantasy or Gritty Reality,8,5 February 2021,"First, I never watched the trailer so no expectations going in to this. It starts with ""Gregg"" snorting a couple Hydrocodone (that's on the RX bottle) before entering his boss's office, clearly that's the beginning of his journey through this magical fantasy of meeting his ""dream woman"" and further going deeper into a pseudo perfect world as a doctor with no worries and a perfect life? The beginning of the movie is his fall to a deeper realm where the lines of reality and fantasy are blurred. Every time he seems to get clarity, Isabel pulls him back in with the ""magic crystal"" drug that gives them unlike human powers that he keeps falling for. You can see similarities between his life with Isabel in her squander and other characters around her. One homeless man throws him a beer. Ironically in his other world and in the same direction of movement, a man throws him an apple. That's the same scene only one is fantasy and the other reality. When they leave the dinner party and things go back to ""somewhat"" reality, they are replaying the beginning of his mental downward spiral. The suicide of his boss (who is seen still alive) the two of them robbing the guy for his car previously thinking she was turning a John. Then the somewhat heartfelt moment when the cops surrounded them and the dialogue muttered similar word to when they were around the pool. (Total Confusion)
MY OWN THOUGHTS: They were both mentally disturbed and Gregg was looking for an escape. He was already out of it and met Isabel who preyed on his weak mind. She gave him hallucinogen's the whole time they were together and when they start wearing off, she gets unreasonable and erratic. She constantly gives them to him so that she can keep him at her mercy, he is her simulation and tool, not the world she is alternatively feeding him. Total gaslighted the guy into believing they were meant to be together. I really enjoyed the movie and thought to myself ""if Salma Hayek invited me to her homeless domain, that's a ""YES"" but now, reconsidering? 🤷‍♂️",Bliss

Humanizing homeless people (which are predominantly women of color) and people with addictions as ~just people~ wouldve been noble; showing the scariness of aging wouldve been great too, but this? this is just gross. ""Braids not brains"" and all the weirdly race-related anecdotes around his kids weren't lost on me either. So the people of color surrounding this man (specifically the women since his son isn't even given that much significance) are basically shallow husks of a real person meant only to make him more interesting and torment him or enrich his life, even to the point that the basis of his delusions is ""IS THIS LADY REAL?""

527,denvarghese,Story telling sans borders,9,26 February 2021,"If you're one of those people who thinks this movie deserves less than 8 stars, there is a question I need to ask you - how does it feel living with that drab mind of yours? That said let's move on.The movie is unapologetically artistic, the lack of explanations throughout makes it even more so - the writers and directors have written and directed this film for a specific group of intellectuals... viewers who don't look for an explanation to each scene, viewers who don't expect unrealistic dramatism, sudden insertions of humor, or unwarranted action movie bullcrap and special effects.The drug addiction problem in the US, whether it is opioid addiction, meth addiction, heroine addiction - these are very real issues. Bliss does a great job in attempting to accurately describe the perspective of the druggie.Movies like ""trainspotting"", ""basketball diaries"", ""requiem for a dream"" and ""fear and loathing in las vegas"" - each tries to depict drug addiction in their own manner, and do so very well. But they (their directors) tend to dabble with episodes of comic relief, and unnecessarily indulge in drama and often some very unrealistic actions - which detract from the experience. This is where Bliss sets itself apart, and that is why it deserves a platform.If you are the type of person who when he/she looks at any form of art - finds himself/herself looking beyond what the artist's canvas/stage depicts and constantly searches for the inspiration/thoughts/artistic heart behind it - then this movie is for you.Bliss in its own way depicts the drug addicted life of a father of two (Owen Wilson), addiction has alienated him from his family, work-life and - reality.

If you follow the symbolism and metaphors, starting with the foreshadowing by the Drug Rehab center sign seen out of Greg's office window, you can get an enlightening idea of what it is like to be addicted to drugs and to be homeless. To me, Isabel is quite literally Addiction itself. As she appears dirtier and her hair more disheveled, he is becoming more addicted.This movie was eye-opening for me because I'd never before been able to understand that someone being ""blissed out of their mind"" could actually seem better to them than the real world around them. A drug high can seem like a utopia compared to everyday struggles, guilt, pressure, stress, and poverty. Escaping to that temporary place is a reprieve and I now better understand the allure and difficulty of breaking addiction.

You feel the pain, the joy, the hope and the failure. It moves you from one end of the feeling spectrum to the other. When they go back and forth from the drug induced realty to the sober reality, it can be a bit to confusing but notice the little nuances and clues to help you understand better. The beginning may not make sense to some people who don't have a clue about what the movie is about, perhaps limited expansion of the mind or having never felt the pain and struggle of drug addiction. To take away stars from this review because you didn't understand it is ridiculous when the performances from Salma Hayek and Owen Wilson were just phenomenal! They are usually in cheeky funny films but for them to take on these challenging roles which is definitely outside of their norm, was just so impressive to me! Some people are just to harsh for no damn reason!This film moved me in many ways! Amazing film and performances! Keep an open mind, feel what the characters are feeling and you will be left emotionally impacted! I thought about this movie for days afterward because emotionally, it hit me pretty hard! Please go enjoy it with an open mind and open heart! Peace!",Bliss

575,iwpreyg,Very interesting,9,7 February 2021,"I enjoyed the movie overall. Some loops and turns through tout the movie made it more interesting to me. However I didn't like the ending much; what happened to Isabel, was she real? The scenes with the drug haze of being under the influence felt so real that I could relate to the feeling. I enjoyed the movie and would watch it again.",Bliss
576,lilchrisse,A real world tale of mental health and addiction,9,14 February 2021,This is a beautifully told story with striking and wrenching performances fron Owen. W and Selma.H.a roller-coaster ride of emotion and delusion come to a head when the pair meet and become lost in their own worlds.the movie is a great portrait of how it can go so wrong so quickly and how we not only hurt ourselves but the ones we love.loved it 100% recommend. POWERFUL.,Bliss
577,lafrankie,Don't Get It Twisted,6,5 February 2021,"As a viewer if you take a simple approach to this film, you may like it. It is about mental illness that stems from depression and substance abuse. I would have liked to see a scene where Owen Wilson's character comes to realize it was all a delusion, but that is up to the viewer I guess.",Bliss
578,sobrid,The Universe is Mental,10,12 February 2021,"It surprises me to see the low rating. This movie is actually a genius. The feel this movie leaves you watching as if you are just as confused as the characters. Both Salma and Owen have great dynamic making things feel real.
It is not sci-fi genre. It is psychological. The universe is mental. It is a beautiful make-believe world, and most of us are chasing the bliss. It is a beautiful film, for the ones with strong empathy.",Bliss
