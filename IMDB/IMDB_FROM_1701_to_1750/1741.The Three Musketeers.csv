0,TheLittleSongbird,Entertaining if heavily flawed,6,22 October 2011,"To be honest, I was expecting The Three Musketeers to be much worse than it turned out. Is it flawed? Yes, and in a very heavy way. But is it that bad? Personally I don't think so. While there were much better movies this year such as Drive and Tree of Life, there have been much worse such as Spy Kids 4 and Bucky Larson: Born to be a Star.Starting with The Three Musketeers' problems, it is under-characterised, particularly with Lerman's D'Artagnan. For me, the most interesting character was Richelieu. The writing is often very cheesy and anachronistic, with Lerman and Bloom getting the worst of it, though there are some nice snappy moments too with McFadyen, Mikelssen and Waltz.The story is a wonderful one, and is well paced generally, however I would have liked more with D'Artagnan and the three musketeers.However, I do think the film looks fantastic. The costumes are beautiful, the Bavarian scenery is stunning and the cinematography is appropriately skillful. The music is suitably rousing and energetic, the direction was decent and the swordplay and stunts are fun and terrifically paced.In regards to the acting, it was generally good. Logan Lerman is handsome and charming if rather flat, likewise with Freddie Fox. Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovovich didn't blow me over I admit, however they were both much better than anticipated.When I first heard of Bloom as Buckingham to me it screamed of disaster, that said he was much less painful than I thought, his dialogue was bad but the performance was okay relying less on the all-looks gimmick. Jovovich is attractive and suitably cunning though I would've liked more of a haunting quality to Milady.On the other hand, Matthew MacFadyen is perhaps the coolest Athos I've seen and James Corden is suitably oafish as Planchet. Luke Evans and Ray Stevenson give good support as Aramis and Porthos. The two best actors were Christoph Waltz, who is pitch perfect(as usual) as Richelieu, and Mads Mikelssen as a sinister Rochefort.All in all, an entertaining if flawed movie. Those looking for a faithful adaptation, even with the references, will be disappointed, those willing to look past this and take it for what it is(like me) will enjoy it. Of the adaptations of the Dumas masterpiece, look no further than the 1973 Richard Lester film for the definitive version, with that said this was good enough to pass an hour and three quarters or so. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Three Musketeers
1,bkoganbing,Alexander Dumas out of Jack Sparrow,6,4 November 2013,"Young Logan Lerman who was wonderful in two Percy Jackson movies goes back in time for yet another version of The Three Musketeers. It's not your father and grandfather's Three Musketeers. In fact it's Alexander Dumas out of Jack Sparrow.A couple of interesting changes from previous more classic film versions. Young D'Artagnan is in fact young which makes his boisterousness a little more understandable. The other three are older men and contemporaries of his father and his father has taught him all the tricks of the dueling trade. Also young Louis XIII played here by Freddie Fox is young as well which he was when he inherited the throne from his father. He was a rather bumptious youth himself and he finds something of a kindred spirit in Lerman. But his education has been sadly neglected in the department of romance and no wonder is Queen finds the charms of the English Prime Minister the Duke of Buckingham so inviting. The Duke by the way is played by Orlando Bloom with rakish mustache and whiskers and charm to boot.But you got to love those airships over a 150 years before those other French brothers the Mongolfiers invented lighter than air travel. The French them, the British have them and God only knows in the next Captain Jack Sparrow film, maybe Johnny Depp will be piloting one himself. I'm normally not into bowdlerizing classics, but this version of The Three Musketeers has a certain charm to it. Logan Lerman plays D'Artagnan a whole lot like Percy Jackson and since I liked those films it's all to the good.",The Three Musketeers
2,Leofwine_draca,Complete and utter nonsense,3,18 April 2014,"Paul W. S. Anderson has an undeniable talent for making rubbish films. The only three films I've liked of his have been DEATH RACE, SOLDIER and EVENT HORIZON, and everything else before, in-between and after have been simply terrible. Unfortunately, THE THREE MUSKETEERS follows that trend.This is Alexandre Dumas for dummies, or rather teenage boys. The film has little to distinguish it from either the original stories or the other film versions out there. Any plotting is jettisoned in place of comic book level characterisation and endless repetitive scenes of characters running around from place to place or fighting endlessly. Anderson even throws some steampunk elements into the narrative in attempt to freshen it up, but his efforts are in vain.It is a pity, because there are some decent cast members caught up in this mess. Take Matthew Macfadyen, for example, who actually seems to think he's in a proper historical drama (and given the calibre of his performance he should be), along with Ray Stevenson, who of course was in the excellent ROME TV series and who now seems to be stuck making trash. Then there are Euro actors Christoph Waltz and Mads Mikkelsen, who should definitely know better given their talents. It's reassuring to note that Orlando Bloom's acting hasn't improved in all these years, though; if anything, it's worse than ever! The worst thing about THE THREE MUSKETEERS is the open-ended nature of the ending, which hints at a possible sequel. And to be honest with you, I can't think of anything worse than watching Logan Lerman arrogantly strutting his way through another outing as the one-dimensional D'Artagnan.",The Three Musketeers
3,SnoopyStyle,Big Messy Bombastic,5,18 January 2014,"The three Musketeers Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans) are double crossed by Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) and the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) as they try to steal Leonardo Da Vinci's airship blueprints. A year later, cocky restless young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) challenges everyone even the musketeers. When he proves himself in a fight against Richelieu (Christoph Waltz)'s guards, they take the young D'Artagnan in.It's a movie where director Paul W.S. Anderson has injected as much action and CGI as possible in this classic story. It's audacious. It's outrageous. It's colorful. It's bombastic. That's the good part.There are a lot of main characters. Luckily the characters are so familiar. However the story is bloated and close to incoherent. The schemes are overly complicated. The movie is filled with stiff dialog and mannered acting. That's the bad part.I can see both sides of the argument. The action is fun, but the story is tiresome. The complicated scheme requires too much exposition. In the end, that's the failure.",The Three Musketeers
4,nogodnomasters,"FIGHT, LOVE, LIVE",9,22 June 2018,"The movie opens with a brief historical background. Europe is in turmoil and only three French superheroes can save it!As the main characters are introduced we get a quick feel for the movie that it will be light, humorous, Indian Jones adventurous, with our heroes emulating superheroes as they enter the secret vault of Da Vinci to steal his invention plan for the ""war machine"" which looks like an airship. Heart throb Olando Bloom who would have made the idea Aramis, plays a bad guy, The Duke of Buckingham. Aramis is instead played by Luke Evans. Milla Jovovich, stars as Milady de Winter the double agent, the love of Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) and Orlando Bloom. Ray Stevenson is a delightful Porthos which we don't get to see enough on the screen. D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) enters town looking for adventure on his odd looking horse named ""Buttercup"" which is not very manly, even in France.D'Artagnan wants to join up with the trio, which due to budget cuts and the control of the evil Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) has been dissolved. Through various circumstances they are joined together and have a new quest. Milla plays a woman who is skilled with the sword. Her slo-mo moves which she perfected in Resident Evil combat are used in this film. Likewise the foursome fight overwhelming odds.Gabriella Wilde, plays Constance, a lady in waiting who has the heart of D'Artagnan. She delivers to them their impossible quest, one with little chance of success, having to fight and elude armies in two countries. A negative aspect of the film is the anachronistic warship which gave the movie an uncomfortable ""Wild Wild West"" feeling, perhaps for the teen appeal. RPG type fighting. Don't look for too much Dumas in this film.Great movie for the big screen. Good dialogue.No F-bombs, nudity, or sex. Appears to be kid safe",The Three Musketeers
5,kosmasp,Update 1000.0,6,5 March 2012,"I have not kept track of how many Three Musketeer movies they are. And this won't go down in history as the best adaptation ever (well for the majority of the people that is). But its update is kinda fun to watch. Not really good, but kinda fun. Even if you feel that some actors are wasted here (Waltz had to wait until Carnage to have a role that he could actually work with again, after ""Ingl. Basterds"") or are not on the screen often enough (pick a name).But you can't fail the movie for trying to be a hip update. It does have some nice ideas, some ""funny"" bits (dialogue isn't that bad actually) and nice action sequences. A light entertainment movie overall then, that you might enjoy if you want to.",The Three Musketeers
6,jboothmillard,The Three Musketeers,5,22 April 2014,"From director Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Death Race), I had already seen the 1993 film, and the recent BBC television series, so I was certainly up for another version. Basically set in Venice during the 17th Century, the Musketeers, Athos (Robin Hood's Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Thor's Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Clash of the Titans' Luke Evans), are disbanded and put on the streets of Paris by Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz), following a failed scheme to steal airship blueprints by Leonardo Da Vinci. Meanwhile young, reckless and ambitious D'Artagnan (Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief's Logan Lerman) is unaware that the Musketeers have been disbanded, he has dreams of becoming a musketeer himself and has started his journey from Gascony to find them, he does eventually find them, offending them and challenges them to a duel. A fight between them is stopped when guards try to arrest them for illegal duelling, the three ex-musketeers and D'Artagnan fend off the attacking guards and get away, afterwards the four become a band and make their motto, ""All for one, and all for one"", they agree to work together to gain their good reputation back and bring justice to the guilty. Richelieu wants to get rid of the Musketeers, he also plots with Athos' former lover Milady De Winter (Milla Jovovich) to take the throne and kingdom from King Louis XIII of France (Freddie Fox) and his wife Queen Anne (Atonement's Juno Temple), and he has Rochefort (Casino Royale's Mads Mikkelsen) and the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) to help him, but the Musketeers and D'Artagnan are determined to save the royal family and all of France. Also starring James Corden as Planchet, Inglorious Basterds' Til Schweiger as Cagliostro and Dexter Fletcher as D'Artagnan's Father. The acting of this is as good as you would expect, with Waltz being suitably snide and Corden providing good comic relief, I admit the story isn't perhaps the most original or thought out, but the fight sequences and some special effects for things like air balloons and a couple of explosions they are the most fun to watch, it's not a bad swashbuckling adventure. Worth watching!",The Three Musketeers
7,Tweekums,Entertaining if flawed,6,24 November 2019,"As this film opens the Three Musketeers, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, along with Milady de Winter stealing plans for an airship from the vaults of Leonardo de Vinci in Venice. Milady then betrays them and sells the plans to the Duke of Buckingham. This failure leads the dastardly Cardinal Richelieu to have the musketeers disbanded. A year later d'Artagnan, a young man, heads to Paris determined to become a musketeer. Here he separately manages to encounter, and offend, each of the three musketeers and ends up challenging each of them to a duel! As they prepare to fight they are confronted by the cardinal's forces. After a fight they are arrested and taken before the king. Following words from the queen he spares them. Soon after Richelieu plots with Milady to frame the queen by making it look as if she has betrayed the king by getting involved with Buckingham. This involves forging certain papers and planting jewels in the Tower of London. When the musketeers learn of the plot they move to thwart it.There have been many versions of 'The Three Musketeers' over the years and I'm sure this won't be the last. As one would hope it provides plenty of action; this is well handled in an almost bloodless way. There are sword fights, including one on the roof of Notre Dame Cathedral, and battles between airships. There is a good degree of humour including some fun references to other films that still work if you don't get the reference. Unfortunately the plot isn't that great and neither is the acting... even those who do fairly well have been better elsewhere; of course this may be down to the material they are working with... James Cordon's 'yahooing' any time his annoying comedy character was involved in any action was particularly grating. The airships are a bit sci-fi, wind-punk?, but I rather enjoyed them. Overall I'd not call this a must see but it has enough fun elements to make it worth watching if it is on TV or if the DVD is in the bargain bin.",The Three Musketeers
8,ma-cortes,Again an intrepid young D'Artagnan along with three legendary Musketeers have to fight Milady of Winter and villainous Cardinal Richelieu,6,1 May 2014,"Lavish scenarios , spectacular action , court intrigue and exciting swordplay .

Thrilling as well as evocative musical score by Paul Haslinger , the dance music near the end is appropriate for the time period . Glamorous production design is well reflected on the luxurious interiors and exteriors stunningly filmed . Impressive sets , though many of them made by computer generator , the so called ""Ring of fire"" crows nest with its 31 cannons was built as a fully working version out of a mass of wood in only fourteen days by a big German company , it is on display in the Babelsberg movie studio film park. The motion picture was professionally realized by Paul W.S. Anderson .

9,tavm,This was a good enough viewing of my first seeing any movie featuring The Three Musketeers,7,24 October 2011,"As someone who's never seen any previous adaptation of The Three Musketeers in its entirety before this one, I must say I pretty much enough enjoyed this one. The 3-D images added a little to the experience too! As an aside, my movie theatre-working friend thought the one who portrayed Porthos was Richard Moll, you know ""Bull"" from ""Night Court"", but it was actually Ray Stevenson. I knew it couldn't be Moll since he really didn't look like him. The one who played Milady did look familiar so I wasn't surprised to see that she was portrayed by Milla Jovovich. I didn't recognize Orlando Bloom. But I did recognize Christoph Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu. Okay, in summation, I thought this version of the classic tale by Alexandre Dumas was good enough for the matinée viewing I attended.",The Three Musketeers
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"About what you'd expect, possibly slightly better",7,15 October 2011,"Following a few minutes of Assassin's Creed footage, this presents a plan intended to start a war between England and France, and only the titular heroes can stop it. Let's start with what you're probably most interested in learning; yes, this is very much a Paul W.S. Anderson film(albeit it may be his best... though he still makes mistakes, such as setting things up that he does not follow through on, pay-off to things he only introduced seconds before it, etc.), for better or for worse, and yes, it is a fun ride if you are prepared for what it is, and you can live with it playing fast and loose with historical accuracy, and how close it is to the source material(it does include one or two notable things that I'm told are in the novel, and that we're familiar with). The action is stronger than any of his others, if he still does overuse slow-mo slightly(he goes downright 300 in one sequence, and it isn't anywhere near as good), and the scenes tend to either end too soon or go on for overly long. There are a few standout situations that I won't soon forget. This uses 3D extremely well, second only to Avatar, usually adding to the atmosphere and only a few times jabbing the audience in the face with something(one or two of those occurrences could be more effective). In general, the FX are amazing. The sets, costumes and props are gorgeous, as opulent as they ought to be. Dialog is usually bad or mediocre, with one or two clever lines. The comic relief is not funny, although this can make you chuckle(not exclusively intentionally). Vital to almost any version of The Three Musketeers is D'Artagnan, and this one is reasonable. He's not obnoxious, and he can be charming. Oh, he's flat as a board... all the characters are(another mainstay of this director). Athos, Porthos and Aramis are among the numerous well-cast actors. Milla is delicious as the deceiving double-agent Lady Winter, Waltz is spot-on as Richelieu, Mikkelsen is a despicable villain, and Fox as the king does well. In fact, the latter has to both be a laughing stock(a pathetic, childish ruler devoid of perspective) and sympathetic(he's an awkward young man in love). He pulls them off, but this really could have done better if it didn't try for so much at a time. The plot is excessively convoluted, full of holes, and in the end does not hold up to any kind of scrutiny. I recommend this to fans of Jovovich and her husband. 7/10",The Three Musketeers
11,ferguson-6,And One Not for All,4,24 October 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. The trailer told me all I need to know, but my life-long interest in all things related to the Alexandre Dumas novel had me ignoring my movie gut instincts and heading out to catch this latest version of the Muskateer saga. Since then, I have been telling myself ""I told you so"".Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson & the Olympians) plays the young, brash D'Artagnian, son of a former Muskateer. Lerman may develop into a fine actor someday, but right now he is as bland on screen as Orlando Bloom, who happens to play rival Duke of Buckingham. Athos, Aramis and Porthos are played, respectively, by Matthew Macfadyen (Pride & Prejudice), Luke Evans (Tamara Drewe) and Ray Stevenson (Volstagg in Thor).The boys are a bit out of sorts after being tricked by double-agent Milady, played by Milla Jovovich, who apparently is really working for the conniving Cardinal played by Christoph Waltz. Mads Mikkelsen plays Rochefort the evil army leader and master swordsman, but somehow even with Waltz and Mikkelsen, this film is just lacking in bad guy substance.Director Paul W.S. Anderson is known best for his Resident Evil film series and his love of special effects is on full display here. There were scenes that reminded me of Will Smith's Wild Wild West, and others that looked like Robert Downey, Jr's Sherlock Holmes. If you love the Dumas novel, you just cringed. The key to the Muskateers is swashbuckling and sharp, sarcastic wit surrounding wild and athletic sword play, all performed for an honorable mission.It's not the first movie in which I have disappointed, and it certainly won't be the last. It's just frustrating because ... I told me so.",The Three Musketeers
12,anaconda-40658,One of the Better Versions.,8,14 September 2015,"The Three Musketeers (2011): Dir: Paul W.S. Anderson / Cast: Logan Lerman, Milla Jovovich, Orlando Bloom, Christoph Waltz, Gabriella Wilde: A surprisingly entertaining version of a story that has been exhausted through many terrible releases. Director Paul W.S. Anderson has made many stupid films such as Soldier and Event Horizon but here he presents the famed characters as a token of grand entertainment. Problem is that the title fails since there seems to be four or five Musketeers here as oppose to the usual. Lerman Logan is the young new edition whose father was a Musketeer and he seeks the same reputation. He gets his wish when several misunderstandings lead to a planned confrontation, which fuses into beating up several armed guards. They are arrested and end up on a quest involving airship blueprints and a stolen necklace. Logan fares well as the young Musketeer out to prove himself as well as place himself within the midst of danger and exhilarating sword action. Milla Jovovich steals scenes as a female who betrays the Musketeers after a theft. She is faced with an effective situation aboard an airship that seems too fatal until the closing scene. Orlando Bloom is good as villain Buckingham who outsmarts the Musketeers with Jovovich's betrayal but his defeat bears some humour. Gabriella Wilde plays Logan's romantic other who attempts to warn him of the odds against him. The screenplay is entertaining without being too action oriented, yet celebrating the special effects. Do not expect a provocative writing but do expect fun filled pointless entertainment. Score: 8 / 10",The Three Musketeers

They are all lambasted by studios, but since his movie 'shopping' I have enjoyed his popcorn flicks, because they aim to entertain the masses, and not to bother the grey matter.It stops here. From the word go, I knew I wasn't going to enjoy this, one was because it was in 2-D and it vexed me that every character at one point aimed something at the screen, and secondly, it seems that Anderson has become self aware and has just made a movie that even he wouldn't enjoy.It's nonsense and no amount of talent on screen can make up for the turgid script, lame performances and the longing for Alan Rickman to appear on screen and chew the script up.Thre is no continuity and even though the though of airship battles and bullet time flips were endearing, on screen they feel old.It's a rare case of me thinking that the 3-D may have improved the film, and the twist of the knife was the promise of a sequel.Never before have I longed for Sheen, Sutherland, and Platt.A bad movie.",The Three Musketeers
14,phd_travel,Great effects and charming leads,9,29 January 2012,I thought why remake this again? Is there a point? Actually there is. It's grander than the last version with Rebecca de Mornay and Chris O'Donnell. They have very cleverly incorporated special effects available today to make a pretty spectacular new version of this classic tale.The sets are very attractive and the movie has an authentic European on location feel. The back drops are like oil paintings but still very beautiful. The modern inventions fit well into the period and the action doesn't overwhelm the time period like the recent Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey. The dialog is witty and funny especially the villains. There is a good story without confusing twists and jumps in time. The battle is quite spectacular and inventive.I liked the casting. Matthew MacFayden (Ararmis) who was in Pride and Prejudice is an underutilized actor. He is good and earnest. Orlando Bloom (Buckingham) is an effective villain. So is Christoph Waltz and the Cardinal who delivers an Inglorious style performance. Milla is striking as Milady - luckily she got to do this role before getting too old. Logan Lerman as d'Artagnan is a bit too boyish and looks overwhelmed by the action at times.Look forward to a sequel - they have a winning formula here. Much better than expected.,The Three Musketeers
15,siderite,Everything in the trailer and not much more,7,1 March 2012,"If you would take Pirates of the Caribbean and replace Johnny Depp with Mila Jovovich and changed pirates with musketeers you would not get a movie much different from The Three Musketeers. That doesn't mean it is not fun, but forget any hope of suspension of disbelief. This is eye candy only, with some occasional reasonable jokes and a lot of pumped up action.As it is, the film does not cheat, and I guess that is something. You get what you expect if you see the trailer. Not much else going on, though. No connection to any reality, modern or feudal.Bottom line: best scene is when Mila is pouting for being caught.

Cinematography captures each moment with flourish. Editing is alright. Art & Costume Design are note-worthy. Action-Sequences are excellent.Performance-Wise: Matthew Macfadyen is adequate. Logan Lerman has two standard expressions from start to end. Ray Stevenson is credible. Luke Evans makes a sincere attempt to look the part. Milla Jovovich is fabulous. She stands out.

17,KineticSeoul,Absurd and ridiculous but somewhat entertaining,6,15 May 2012,"I personally think some critics are being way to harsh on this movie. I know that this lacks elements that make a coherent and well blended movie but the thing is. This flick is a decent popcorn flick that is actually a bit entertaining. Despite the atrocious dialogue, pretty bad acting and the campy style of it all. But for some parts the campy style actually does work for this movie. This is one of those movie that doesn't take itself seriously and can even get absurd at times but the point is, it doesn't try to be more than what it is. And knows what types of movie it's trying to be, which is a absurd and very unrealistic and yet entertaining flick. There has been plenty of Three Musketeers movies in the past, one before this one being somewhat of a kung-fu flick that was ridiculous as well but wasn't as entertaining as this one but had a bit more when it came to the story. And kinda like the previous one this one is a stylized and bit modernized version of the classical novel that is set in the 17th century. This one freaking even has airship in it like the one from one of the Final Fantasy video game. And even has airship battles as well and not just that there are some ridiculous scenes. And it's not because of what it is but because of how it was executed in the movie, it's just laughable at times. When it comes to the villains in this movie you can't take most of them seriously. Christoph Waltz was okay and best and Orlando Bloom is basically a hipster in this. Despite the many flaws in this movie, it's still fast-paced and entertaining to some degree.6.5/10",The Three Musketeers

It's sort of a modern 'steampunk' variation on the beloved tale and is packed with action and 3D visual effects. It was produced and directed by Anderson and written by Andrew Davies and Alex Litvak. It stars Anderson's usual femme fatale Milla Jovovich as well as hot young star Logan Lerman (of 'PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS' fame) in the D'Artagnan role. Christoph Waltz, Orlando Bloom and Juno Temple also star in colorful supporting roles and Matthew Macfadyen, Ray Stevenson and Luke Evans play the three Musketeers. It's the type of routine cheesball B movie fluff you'd expect from Anderson. Fans of his will probably love it while purists and more traditional fans of the original material will hate it. I find myself somewhere in between (but I'm not a die hard fan of Anderson or 'The Three Musketeers').This version opens with Athos (Mcfadyen), Porthos (Stevenson) and Aramis (Evans) stealing airship blueprints by Leonardo Da Vinci in Venice. They are betrayed by their partner in crime, Athos's lover Milady De Winter (Jovovich), and she hands the blueprints over to her partner in crime, the Duke of Buckingham (Bloom). The Musketeers are disbanded by Cardinal Richelieu (Waltz) back in France and Athos and his buddies become disillusioned and bitter (especially Athos, who's heart is broken). Their inspiration is rejuvenated of course when a young wannabe musketeer, named D'Artagnan, looking to follow in his father's footsteps shows up in Paris. After first making enemies with the three, over trivial quarrels, D'Artaganan joins Athos and his team and the four take on a new adventure of stopping a plot hatched once again by Milady, the Duke of Buckingham and Richelieu. The film is action packed and fans of recent swashbuckling films like this will probably be more than amused. The 3D is used to optimum effect and the visuals are pretty. The actors are all decent enough (especially Stevenson, who's becoming a popular scene stealer lately, and Bloom, who probably gives his best performance to date) and for what it is the directing is fitting too. Of course hardcore fans of Dumas and classic literature will cry blasphemy but not any more so than they did for the 1993 Disney version (which I'd say this is about equal to) or the 1991 Kevin Costner version of 'Robin Hood'. Fans of those types of films will probably love this movie. I enjoyed it but only moderately so.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lBzdmfUfA",The Three Musketeers
19,bowmanblue,Or rather... the Three Musketweens,5,12 March 2015,"The latest version of The Three Musketeers is rated a 12 certificate in the UK. Make note: 12. Basically, if you're much older than that (and sadly I'm in my thirties) you're not going to get much out of this film (apart from staring at Milla Jovovich).It retells the classic story about the three musketeers and D'artagnan teaming up to... oh, I forget. There were baddies in it with varying accents (all actors were allowed to keep their native tongues making characters' nationalities difficult to guess) and most of them dressed like Monty Python characters. Throw some over the top computer special effects and fight scenes into the mix - the latter being slowed down like something out of the Matrix then completely rewrite history adding laser guns in the eighteenth century (okay, no lasers, but airships and rotating machinegun type things were pretty far-fetched) and you have a 'blockbuster' on your hands.However, the Three Musketeers will only be classed as the epic blockbuster it tries so hard to be if it erases all cinema knowledge you possess. It borrows so many things from so many films and genres, everything it is gets too diluted. The characters are typical MTV generation wise-cracking, unfazable self-assured types who never put so much as a hair out of place (talking of hair - what's with D'Artagnan's? It's possibly the worst haircut in modern film history).Bottom line - it's predicable. You've seen it all done before and better (and probably with more believable computer special effects).This one's for the kids. If I want an rip-roaring 'adult' adventure for all the family, I'll stick to Indiana Jones (minus the Crystal Skull of course).",The Three Musketeers
20,MLDinTN,it favors too much of a comedy,4,20 November 2012,"I thought this was supposed to be more of a serious adventure story, but this version tries to much for the laughs and gets silly at times. Such as when Milady goes Matrix and slides along the booby trapped hall or when she twirls through the air dodging wires to get the diamonds. And then the two flying ships, I don't think those were around in 1800s France. And they made King Louie kind of a wimpy dude whose easily tricked.And I didn't think the acting was anything great.

After a conspiracy against the king is uncovered it is up to a group known as the Three Musketeers and a young man named D'Artagnan (Lerman) to stop Milady (Jovovich) and save the king and all of France. As I have stated many times the way you feel about a movie is about 85% based on expectations. Usually you can say that a movie is better or worse then expected when telling people about it. This is the rare type of movie that is exactly what I expected. I thought it was gonna be boring with good fighting...and that's exactly what it is. The beginning and end are great but the story aspect is drawn out. I think that the main reason it felt that way is because this story has been re-done so many times that it begins to lose impact with every version. I don't really blame anyone for that but you can only do the same thing over and over before it becomes boring. Another example of Hollywood running out of ideas. Overall, not bad, not good, just OK.

Apparently, this action movie is about France's royal guard - and not pre-teens in mouse ears.Determined to follow in his father's footsteps by serving the King of France alongside the Musketeers, D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) heads to Paris to enlist.Upon arriving he learns of the guard's disbandment. Fortunately, fate aligns him with former members, Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans).After proving his parry, D'Artagnan joins the ex-Musketeers as they set out to save the queen from being framed by a treacherous cardinal (Christoph Waltz) and his assistant (Milla Jovovich).Featuring fast-paced fencing matches, airship dogfights and slow-mo explosions, this bombastic adaptation is as far removed from Alexandre Dumas' novel as possible.Besides, we all know that after retirement the Musketeers didn't sail around in a flying boat, they invented a chocolate bar.

23,tabuno,Missed Opportunity for Greatness,7,18 January 2019,"31 October 2011. Surprisingly much better than expected but its very premise of its Musketeers and France and Britain destroy any of its credibility and the leading character seems too much of a cocky, arrogant, narcissist to be really very appealing, except to hope somehow something would happen all of which is a great distraction to the enjoyment of this quite captivating fusion of honor for France and pure fantasy. Unlike The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), this awkward attempt to mesh period historical setting and history with legend and then the adapted imagination of what is becoming a photographic technique of slow motion action that will also be found in this year's Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) and the special effects elements of The Matrix (1999) which in a few cases weren't as technical well produced with obvious artificial appearing elements in a number of cases, especially in the beginning. Whether or more straight forward version in the The Man in the Iron Mask (1998) along with a tight script and the vision of this director might have come up with a better product it's difficult to tell. The characters of the royal court also were underdeveloped a bit and could have been fleshed out a little more to great impact. Milla Jovovich is the surprise package in this movie, who is demonstrating a wider range of acting, from the more innocent, naive but superior being of The Fifth Element (1997), though even her character seems to be off balanced in contrast to the other characters - there doesn't seem any sufficiently strong character to counterbalance her presence. The beginning is both compelling and off-putting...the twist being a nice opening plot surprise, much like something one would find in a James Bond movie but then its cinematography seems markedly different from the rest of the movie to somewhat of a confusing distraction as to tone and pacing for the rest of the movie. Overall, this is a credible, creative, and action themed movie, but due to its dissonate elements, to keeps this movie from being one of the blockbusters of the year.",The Three Musketeers
24,clanciai,Very dashing show with nothing but tricks - but well made,8,16 November 2020,"No matter how dashing and skilfully made, this is all superficiality and very far from Dumas - he would have laughed but nevertheless been outraged. There is no room here for any character development, they are all just types with nothing to make them interesting except the very witty diaslogue, but it is all 21st century Hollywood with every possible technical finesse and trick, and there is more lost of the novel here than anything left of it. The whole drama is ignored, and Buckingham even survives to take revenge - in league with Mylady, who is just a Nikita agent in the 17th century. The costumes and scenery though are perfect and impressing, and the music is all right too, but you miss the real drama, characters and realistic 17th century thriller story.",The Three Musketeers

26,Rodrigo_Amaro,A little enjoyable but very troubled.,6,20 February 2013,"Innovations and retellings doesn't equal new qualities. Hollywood is doing this with everything, new ways to introduce quality characters and stories into new fashions, angering the purist fans and getting new adepts. From James Bond to Batman, from Sherlock Holmes to Anna Karenina, the reboot has take'em all, sometimes improving, other times causing minimal effects. Alexandre Dumas's ""The Three Musketeers"" in this version directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (""Resident Evil"") is part of the latter It tries so hard to impress that it's almost embarrassing. Won't say I was disappointed, just felt too little to say I was truly rewarded, deeply lost in the entertainment. These Musketeers, despite being on the same environment designed and created by Dumas, seem to be adventuring on a fantastic weird version of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" which includes a fight on a floating ship or a prototype of a 18th century balloon. All in all, it's just another adventure, fights and fun moments with the classical characters Athos (Matthew Macfayden), Porthos (Ray Stevenson), Aramis (Luke Evans) and their unexpected and amusing welcoming of D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman, best in the movie), and of course their rivalry against Count Richelieu (Christoph Waltz, a Hans Landa rendition to this role would be awesome but he's completely underused) and others such as the traitors Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich, this wouldn't be an Anderson movie without her), the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) and the menacing Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen, quite good). I don't care if they spent millions of dollars in building sceneries, developed latest visual effects or paid huge salaries to the actors, all I know is that a classical story like this one translated into a new version haven't done anything for me, I didn't felt a single thing except some occasional sleepy moments, few laughters, and no excitement whatsoever. The 1949 version made by MGM is amazing and still entertains like few adventures do today, and the 1993 version is cool, something to relax; and even ""The Man With the Iron Mask"" (1998) is not left behind in quality (those are the instances I've seen, I know there's more out there). Aside from the cast reunion which is fine even though most of them only gives simple, formulaic performances, there's a small amount of redeeming qualities that makes of this version a watchable film. While it lacks in good humor, heart and soul, one can enjoy good sequences like the rooftop fight between D'Artagnan and Rochefort or the fore-mentioned balloon/flying ship sequence. It's just beautiful to look at although it doesn't bring all the sensations it could give. A sign of times, classic stories need classical treatments or maybe some innovations, a greater development with a better director and a far greater script. To quote a great poet: ""I thought it wasn't half bad"". And to quote the lovely D'Artagnan when asked if his cocky ways really work on girls: ""Only on Tuesdays!""

27,filipemanuelneto,Musketeers ... The Three Musketeers.,5,14 February 2021,"""The Three Musketeers"" are one of the fiction books most adapted to cinema. This is another adaptation to add to the extensive list, and it is not one of the best. As the script is known, I will not stop to analyze it. I will, however, make a word of advice that is necessary: this film is not even close to being historically credible. It is an almost complete anachronism and portrays the Musketeers and, especially, Milady, as if they were the 17th century's ""James Bond"", full of tactics and inventive gadgets for all occasions.The film is an adventure that begins in Venice, it involves a flying machine supposedly invented by Da Vinci, many creative weapons, choreographed fights, acrobatics and even climbing and gymnastics routines by women in corsets. A mixture so incredible and absurd that I was expecting to see automobiles too, and that shows how far a writer's creative freedom can reach if they don't get their feet on the ground. However, it is a fun movie and entertains the audience quite well.The cast is one of the strong points of this film. I highlight, on a positive note, the performance of Christoph Waltz, who transformed Richelieu into a skilled and manipulative politician under the garb of a pious clergyman. Milla Jovovich is also quite good as Milady, a double agent with a vast arsenal always up his sleeve. Mads Mikkelsen is very effective as a villain and looks like a fearsome opponent. The musketeers (Luke Evans, Ray Stevenson, Matthew Macfadyen) are good enough, given the rewriting of the characters in this film, but they are almost relegated to supporting characters in their own film, a mistake that is quite common in the movies adaptations of this story. Juno Temple and Freddie Fox are funny as a couple but don't have much to do. On the negative side, I didn't like Logan Lerman, I think he was a weak protagonist despite looking young and elegant, and I think Orlando Bloom, for who he is, simply received too much visibility and relevance in a story where it wasn't necessary, resulting in a tiring presence.Technically, the film is quite spectacular. Cinematography is magnificent, with excellent colors and sharpness, and the film was very well edited and handled in post-production. The CGI is impressive and if more proof was needed that there is a lot of money invested in the film it would be enough to see the choice of filming locations: it is an authentic tour through some of the most beautiful palaces in Bavaria, such as Würzburg, Marienberg, Herrenchiemsee, Schleißheim and Pommersfelden. If the beauty of these palaces is undeniable, the film was able to emphasize it. I only regret that, at times, the film seems more baroque than it should be, as if the story were being set fifty years later, in the first decades of the 18th century. The same can be said of the costumes, which nevertheless seem impressive and detailed. However, I already said that historical rigor was run over and killed in this film. The soundtrack is not surprising, assuming an appropriately epic tone without being histrionic.",The Three Musketeers
28,pennyelenabooks,Not at all,3,24 October 2014,"Warning! : This is not the classic story. Well, there are the same characters, the costumes, and some other similarities, like the way they were treating their servant, but that's it. The story between Milady and Athos, even though in the book it was different, is all over the story. But there is romance also between Constance and D'Artagnan, that develops from one scene to the other just like that. So that wasn't enjoyable, like the special effects at the beginning. Plus the big air ships were impressive at the beginning, but after a while they are just boring. Too much unrealistic fighting, too much effort to make it similar to the original story and yet keep it updated, too much sexuality from Milady...I can keep on going but I have to say that there were some good things about that film. The performances were good, Lerman was actually great, but I didn't like Bloom as the bad guy, it just doesn't fit, maybe its because of his previous roles or something. Even with the messed up story line, there are some enjoyable lines too. So 3 out of 10 for the effort. But please, don't make a sequel, as it was suggested in the end of the film.",The Three Musketeers

I've seen it quite a few times at home and it's still a very entertaining movie. The action is well staged and very exciting. The cast (including the always dreamy Milla Jovovich) is very good and they all do a great job. The script is filled with great dialogue and funny jokes. ""The Three Musketeers"" has great action, tons of cleavage and a sweet little romance and it always hits the spot. Honorable mention: James Corden.",The Three Musketeers
30,Vartiainen,Pirates of the Caribbean in France,5,3 December 2012,"The three musketeers are of course an all-time classic so a reboot like this would have been made at some point, but I rather like to think that the success of the Pirates of the Caribbean films encouraged the producers of this travesty to try and recapture the same charm that made the first Pirates film so successful. Because externally they're a lot alike. A popular, heavily romanticized time period is given a new sleek look by focusing on the visuals, modern special effects, tongue in cheek action and pure entertainment.Alas, this just isn't that good. What made the Pirates films so successful were the characters in my opinion. We all know and love Jack Sparrow of course, but the rest of them were very colourful and unique individuals and they worked off each other beautifully. Barbossa and Jack especially. Here the characteristics are only superficial and none of the characters have that charm or instant spark of a legend that Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush managed to instill into their characters. Even Orlando Bloom is rather bland, though many consider him to be the weakest part of the Pirates films as well, so perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.The movie has some merits, however, and is not a total loss. The visuals are very colourful, interesting and fascinating to look at. They're perhaps a bit too... crisp and overly complicated in certain parts, but I still claim that this film looks great and has a pleasing visual look - although the steam punk motives were largely unneeded in my opinion, as they took away from the charm of the musketeer era. The action, though, pretty much saved the film for me. The story is nothing special, if anything it's painfully average, but the action scenes are fast-paced, somewhat original in execution and the choreographs do work.Taking all that into account, I think that this film has a potential as a guilty pleasure. It's entertaining and fun to watch as long as you keep your expectations low and don't expect to be thrilled by the story or the characters. The dialogue has some fun moments in it and I do admit that the boisterous musketeers with their varying personalities are superficially entertaining. The same with D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) and his precious young naivety. They're clichéd, the whole film is clichéd, but I still enjoyed myself.You should still rather read the book, is what I'm saying.",The Three Musketeers
31,BeneCumb,"Uneven, at times ridiculous... With some good performances though",5,15 January 2013,"Most of the time, remakes are not up to the level of initial works and they are thus unnecessary, with the very few exceptions, e.g. when level of technology did not allow to execute the visions of authors or when black-or-white background imposed limitations to full enjoyment. As Dumas' characters have been screened so much during last decades, incl. 1993 version starring good actors still active - Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, Chris O'Donnell, Oliver Platt, Tim Curry - then the one in question was unnecessary undertaking; 3D is not a real excuse, and too much emphasis is set on visual effects and explosions, i.e. external stuff. Modern elements through phrasing and reasoning is not witty, and inclusion of airship is odd.Luckily, there are some pleasant performances - Logan Lerman, Milla Jovovich, Christoph Waltz, Mads Mikkelsen, Orlando Bloom. On the other hand, the actors in the roles of the musketeers, the king and the queen were rather mediocre. I am perplexed that this version obtained so big attention and box office; well, we have no indications how many left the cinema or switched off their TV fretfully.

33,freemantle_uk,Not as bad as it should be,5,23 October 2011,"There are many benefits for studios turning to stories in the public domain: Easy name recognition, freedom to re-interpret the material and most of all, it is free. The Three Musketeers has gone through a number of adaptations over the years; what Alexandre Dumas must think of Paul W. S. Anderson's steampunk version of his classic novel is something many of us would love to know.In the early 17th Century, France has a young king, Louis XIII (Freddie Fox), but Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) is really the power behind the throne. After a failed mission in Venice to steal Leonardo Da Vinci's airship plans, musketeers Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans) quit being swashbuckling adventurers. A young man, D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) dreams of becoming a Musketeer himself and is able to reunite the Musketeers when France is in peril. The Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom) has made a powerful airship that could be used by France's natural enemy, England. Richelieu and his agent Milady de'Winter (Milla Jovovich) want to plant evidence that Buckingham is having an affair with Queen Anne (Juno Temple) to neutralise her as a threat to their plans.Anderson has a bit of a reputation for ruining beloved franchises and he filmed in 3D, which has a reputation all of its own. Luckily, his version of The Three Musketeers isa lot better then expected. The action sequences have what you want: A lot of sword fights, a bit of flint-lock action and of course what all movies need, giant airship battles over Paris. These scenes are fast and very well edited. Anderson at least has some abilities on that front, but he is still drawn to some over-stylised moments, such as when Milady de'Winter has to steal a necklace from a room filled with razor wire.Considering the budget is estimated at around $75 million, the special effects were very strong and helped make the action sequences look more convincing. The obvious highlight is the use of airships whether battling in the skies or crashing into the ground. But the 3D effects did not enhance the movie's experience. It was actually a distraction during a swordfight and it made some of the green screen effects obvious because of a lack of depth in the background. This was a movie that needed to be in 2D.Anderson attempted to make a movie in the spirit of ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Indiana Jones."" He essentially lifted scenes from those movies to make a light-hearted adventure. For example, the raid into the vault was like the opening sequences of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the drawing introducing the characters was like the drawing at the end of Sherlock Holmes and the airship battles were similar to the ""Pirates"" movies. Much of the comedy felt very focused and unfunny. The big running jokes were Louis XIII wanting to copy Buckingham's fashion because he is a style guru and the Musketeers insulting their assistant Planchet (James Corden) as he tries to prove himself. The score was very much a cross between those aforementioned movies, and its general feel was very much like the 2007 fantasy Stardust (maybe it was the Airships).The movie drags when the Musketeers are not on screen and the plot centres on an awkward teenage romance. People want to see the Musketeers fighting, investigating and stopping a major plot like an assassination. The Musketeers must retrieve a necklace to stop a war, but also make sure the queen shows her love for the king. Most of the characters are dull, which makes the romantic subplots even worse, when D'Artagnan kisses the Queen's Lady in Waiting (Gabriella Wilde), it felt like two 10-year-olds having their first awkward kiss. There is no real explanation of the characters' motives and often you just want the movie to go back to the Musketeers, not the internal politics of the French Court.Lerman is the lead and he does not come off with much glory. He spoke in an American accent, which was disconcerting when most of the cast spoke in English and European accents. Lerman had no chemistry with the other actors along with his unbelievable romance. The actual Musketeers were very good, featuring definable personalities and ably played. Macfadyen was a stoic leader fighting his own demons when he is called back into action. He is quiet, but there is anger within him. Stevenson played his character very much like Titus Pullo from Rome, minus the sex and swearing -- a soldier who is good at what he does. Evans' character was underdeveloped, but that is because of the script. He did his best with the little he had.Waltz was basically on auto-pilot and Mads Mikkelsen was playing Le Chiffre again, but as a henchman. Fox's Louis XIII is an annoying little twit who has a decent heart, but little brains, oblivious to the world around him as he tries to win over his mouse of a wife. Bloom was surprisingly strong as a smarmy playboy with an aura of arrogance surrounding him. He should really consider playing more antagonistic characters in the future. And Jovovich was there simply to beat people up and look sexy, but certainly not for her acting talents.The Three Musketeers is a movie that delivers on swashbuckling, but if it had cut much of the swearing, then it could have easily received a PG rating. Violence-wise there has been much worse in PG-13 movies.",The Three Musketeers

It is though a rather flat adaptation and rather too modern in delivery, with an underwhelming script with occasional good humour, but mostly lacklustre and borrowing lines from other films. Some of the set pieces are impressive if a little overwrought and overall it is something of a disappointment which needed a bit more Dumas and a little less George Lucas.

With a filmography that looks more like state's evidence in a criminal case, I certainly had low expectations for his steampunk-lite take on the classic 'Three Musketeers' story. Much to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed it.This is a refreshingly unpretentious, agenda-free film that seeks to do nothing more than entertain, and for me at least, it did just that.

36,jimbo-53-186511,Swashbuckling silliness where camaraderie is what really saves the day,5,13 February 2016,"In some ways this film can be seen as being enjoyable in a tongue-in-cheek, goofy, 'not to be taken seriously' type way, but it's the wait that's involved in getting there that is likely to be a make or break aspect for the audience....I must admit that I'm not overly-familiar with the source material here so wasn't really sure what to expect; however I was slightly disappointed with the actual structure of this film. Here, we have a first half which seemed to have very little going on and seemed to exist only as a long-winded way of introducing D'Artagnan. There are some amusing moments to be found in this set-up, but for me it felt that there was far too much unnecessary padding to what is essentially a fairly simple story.Given that it was slow in building itself up I hoped that my patience would be rewarded by some fantastic swashbuckling action and impressive fight sequences and once again I left feeling slightly disappointed. True, there are some fight sequences and some swashbuckling, but not enough - maybe my expectations were too high, but I just found that the film was rather weak as both an action film and as a story. I also thought that the ending was rather poor as well.Thankfully the film does benefit from strong camaraderie between the principal cast and this does help to carry the film through some of the duller moments and makes it feel slightly better than it should be - as D'Artagnan Lerman brings a sort of cheeky charm to the film and also brings some much needed fun. The likes of MacFadyen, Stevenson and Evans also work their roles well too and all 4 of these players are what really hold this film together.My thoughts on this version of The Three Musketeers is that it was entertaining in spots with the principal cast making it quite fun to watch at times. However, I thought it was a little on the slow side and also thought it would be more action-packed. For those reasons I found it a little disappointing overall.",The Three Musketeers
37,MissSimonetta,Is this real?,5,23 August 2014,"This 2011 version of The Three Musketeers feels like a parody of modern day blockbusters with its over-the-top action and CG. I found myself laughing at it for all the wrong reasons.First off, the whole thing was trying its best to be the next Pirates of the Caribbean. The score itself sounded like a pastiche of the older film's music.The story is only loosely based off the original tale. You could have renamed all the characters and changed the setting, that's how little this resembles the Dumas novel. The alterations are mostly silly and not in a fun way. You'll find yourself face-palming all the way through the run time.The acting is mostly uninspired and poor. The musketeers themselves were all bland. Logan Lerman's D'Artagnan is a pale shadow compared to previous actors who have taken the role. It's obvious Gabriella Wilde was cast as Constance for her beauty and little else; her lifeless monotone and expressionless performance were unbearable.I'll give the film this: the art design is fantastic. The colors mostly pop and the recreation of the lavishness of 17th century French court life are beautiful to look at.

38,davispittman,Bad version,1,18 January 2016,"The three musketeers (2011) is a very poor version/re-telling of the classic three musketeers tale. This version is just poorly written, poorly acted, and to be completely honest, just boring. Logan Lerman was just alright as the lead, could've been a lot better though. Mila really was not good in her role, her performance seemed very wooden and phoned in. The action sequences were honestly just a big fat yawn, NOTHING to get excited about. And the script was just another huge yawn. Overall, this film just is a big yawn, a yawn as far as acting, as far as action sequences, as far as the dialogue/script as well. There really isn't all that much more to say about this movie, it's just boring as all get out, and will not keep your attention at all, so do yourself a favor and just skip this one all together. 1/10.",The Three Musketeers
39,I_Ailurophile,"A silly, far-fetched romp",7,21 June 2021,"It's a preposterous, stylized action-comedy adventure flick with as much in common with 'Hellboy' or 'The league of extraordinary gentlemen' as 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' The dialogue is as ham-handed as most characterizations and action sequences are outlandish. If you're looking for a faithful, period-accurate adaptation of the novel, you've come to the wrong place.'The Three Musketeers' is mindless entertainment, a popcorn movie perhaps inspired by Dumas, but hardly attentive to his works. Not even the slightest effort is made to affect a French accent; the few clever lines are far outnumbered by the exchanges in the script that are altogether hackneyed. Characters and their motivations, like story beats, mostly bear depth roughly about as great as the puddles formed on uneven concrete from a heavy rainstorm. Plot advancement owes far more to direct, unsubtle screenwriting than to convincing narrative flow.Have I sold you on this movie yet?This is about style over substance, emphasized by the editing that utilizes slow-motion and ramping; camerawork that lingers lovingly on director Paul W. S. Anderson's action-star wife Milla Jovovich; and a cast that includes world-class performers like Christoph Waltz and Mads Mikkelsen, yet which is denied an opportunity to truly demonstrate their skill. Highfalutin heist schemes clearly derive their forced sophistication from comedies of recent years revolving around numerical Oceans, while devices shown off during action sequences yield technological advancement far exceeding the setting. The would-be magnificence of some eye-catching shots is counterbalanced by the artificiality of their flair and the over-produced look of the picture generally, while Paul Haslinger's bombastic score echoes the music of any action flick I've mentioned above.With all this having been said, 'The three musketeers' IS fun, as long as you don't mind mostly senseless self-indulgence. As blunt and unbelievable as the movie is, it's all by intent, geared toward a young summer blockbuster audience. Pierre-Yves Gayraud's costume design is marvelous, and set pieces no less grand. Heavy-handed as the picture may be in its tone and appearance, the production design is entrancing, from a standpoint of pure amusement. While the greatest capabilities of the cast are squandered, it's nonetheless a joy to watch them lean into over the top roles with performances that are just as exaggerated.No one is going to mistake this for a cinematic classic, and even among action-adventure films, the sheer aggressiveness of its devotion to flash is overbearing. But sometimes it's okay to just turn your brain off to enjoy the merriment of a ridiculous yarn. 'The three musketeers' is a good time - and every now and again, that's all a movie really needs to be.Recommended for fans of summer blockbusters, and especially for viewers who enjoy fantastical pseudo-period fare like 'Pirates of the Caribbean.'",The Three Musketeers

41,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,The Three Musketeers (2011),6,18 February 2012,"Well it's official. We'll probably never again see fun but believable swashbuckling romps. Now they just have to be filled with CGI, ridiculous action set pieces and inflated budgets. I'm not complaining too much, as this was still enjoyable for the most part. The Three Musketeers has our three heroes left as almost worthless bodyguards to the king. Here they are more like international spies, as the opening scene shows them with gadgets aplenty. After they are betrayed, they hit the bottle pretty hard. Meanwhile the king is being manipulated by the Cardinal, and wheels have been set into motion for a rather convoluted plot that contains many characters. D'Artagnan arrives in Paris and soon inspires the musketeers to once again, care for their country. This is certainly an Anderson movie through and through. He throws in as many booby trapped hallways as he can, and then sends his wife in to dodge wires and bullets in slow motion. Congratulations Paul, you have a sexy wife. Can we move on? Airships and other bizarre contraption make this a blockbuster through and through, but the CGI isn't always up to the task of capturing the fantasy. Bloom is on hand as a sleazy Duke, and a number of great European talents have joined forces to cash in a substantial pay cheque, which will hopefully allow them to get back to their classic work or at least give them some more exposure (Waltz, Schweiger, Mikkelsen). The dialogue is so bad, I think they were trying to see how far they could push it. ""Go away, so you can come back."" I didn't feel too much chemistry between the musketeers, and with so much going on, all the characters remained fairly flat. But if you're looking for a film with some decent action, that is able to laugh at itself at points, this will be for you.",The Three Musketeers
42,p-stepien,"Glitz, glamour and an irksome d'Artagnan",4,22 May 2013,"The swashbuckling musketeers return to the big screen with an opulent bang through the uninspired efforts of Paul W. S. Anderson. Threading together basic plot characters he manages to string together a non-sensical, far-flung adventure story rife with Leonardo da Vinci, flying ships and double-crossing double-crossers. Naturally the key tertio of romantically-driven Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), pretty boy Aramis (Luke Evans) and the bulky gentleman Porthos (Ray Stevenson) actually make for a somewhat amiable band, charmingly churning out incongruous jokes, thus making the best out of the appalling base they have to work on.D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) however is another story. Introduced as a cocky irksome youth with an overgrown ego, devoid of any affable charm, he remains so throughout, thus bringing me to root for the much more charismatic Rochefort (Mads Mikkelsen) during their ultimate battle. Unfortunately, the little brat - as can be expected - survives his ordeal. Backing cast is quite impressive with Milla Jovovich, playing her sexually-charged oft-negliged self so well known from the Resident Evil franchise, but with much less pizazz to her performance, plus Orlando Bloom as the trend-setting Duke of Buckingham and an obviously uninspired Christopher Waltz as Richelieu.The story itself is a checkered ordeal, sometimes working, oft however falling into vast pitfalls of trite clichés. Centered around Richelieu attempting to force France into war by planting the suspicion and then proving that Queen Anne (Juno Temple) is in fact sleeping with the Duke of Buckingham. All this would force the extravagant King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox) into total war with England. Or something in that mold. Unfortunately too much time spent in the bombastic world of ""Resident Evil"" brings a certain zombiesque quality to proceedings with an empty unengaged shell of big bangs, some admittedly enjoyable sword fights, punchless jokes and a very irritating d'Artagnan, more reminiscent of a time-travelling version of Mission Impossible, than a ""Three Musketeers"" re-imagining. All in all a pointless escapade into the world of Alexandre Dumas's famed book. And not even the most lavish set pieces and bombastic explosions can save this misfiring effort.",The Three Musketeers

The background settings were fantastic, but and I don't know if CGI played a part or that we saw the actual background settings. Hard to tell.The setting is in France, but no one spoke with a French accent and, in this movie, that was a very good thing. But, here's the thing: the dialogues were good, the acting fine, but what upset everything were the fight scenes. Not good. Kind of lame and that made me look at everything else as lame too. Unfair? Probably. But, the choreography for the fight scenes were not as good as they should have been. The fight scenes seemed to be an after-thought when they should have been the serious focus of the story. The scenes with the war ship or air war ship from a DeVinci design were fairly good, not great. From other movies of the Musketeers I have seen in the past, the D'Artagnan character was a full grown man. Here we have Logan Lerman looking like a teenage hippie with a sword. Maybe that was what was wrong here. Didn't help.Now, what was really good? Christoph Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu and Gabriella Wilde (hey, I fell in love here) as Constance, D'Artagnan's love interest; and, of course, Orlando Bloom as Lord Buckingham. And, let's not forget Milla Jocovich as Milady as she was probably the most honest character in here playing a double agent so to speak. Maybe I am being too harsh, but this came out in 3-D and had I seen it that way I may have had a better perspective. Ya think? Ah, not really.This was not entertaining for me, but the 11-yr olds will probably like it anyway. And, isn't that who this kind of movie is made for anyway? Seemed like it. Anyone?

(PG-13)Knowingly absurd (and cheerfully stupid), clockpunk-flavored version of the Alexandre Dumas evergreen sails over ""the top"" on the tail fins of battling airships equipped with dragon-mouthed flamethrowers, because why not? The actors playing the baddies all seem to be having a good time, with Bloom especially going wild chewing all the grandiose scenery in sight, but our heroes are a truly weak bunch--they forgot to give Aramis (Evans) and Porthos (Stevenson) specific character traits and personalities (and banter...how could they so often forget to let the Three Musketeers banter?), and Lerman plays D'Artagnan as such a cocky drag that one actually longs for the ""electrifying charisma"" of Chris O'Donnell. It's very difficult to successfully combine breezy, tongue-in-cheek adventure with gargantuan spectacle, and director Anderson is hardly up to the task, but there are isolated moments of swashbuckling fun (some of which belong in the are-you-freaking-serious category) and the occasional striking visual--dig the palace interiors and dynamic maps of Western Europe.

45,mike48128,The Three Musketeers Meets the Flying Pirates of the Caribbean!,8,2 March 2017,"It's the original Alexander Dumas story about the purloined necklace with a few unusual twists. Some good and some outrageous. A lot of carnage as the 3 Musketeers plus D'Artegnan, engage over 40 young guards, kill most of them, and act like they just finished a quiet game of chess. Later on, muskets and cannons make it less crude. Milla Jovovich (as Milady De Winter) somewhat reprises the ""busty"" comic role made famous by Rachel Welch in an earlier version of this film. She plays a double spy, but her own interests come first. Gabriella Wilde is very fetching as the love interest of D'Artegnan. It opens with a direct steal from Indiana Jones. Leonardo Da Vinci's Treasure vault is filled with booby-traps. Milady runs away with Da Vinci's plans for a flying airship, which end up with The Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). He builds an airship and so does France. Such an anachronism! What gas do they fill the ""blimps"" with? They otherwise resemble giant warships equipped with advanced conventional weapons. To retrieve the necklace, The Musketeers must journey to England and return it to Queen Anne's neck. Otherwise a terrible war will break out. It's complicated! Familiar villains include one-eyed ""Rochefort"" and Cardinal Richelieu. An airborne dogfight between the airships and a duel-to-the-death on the parapet of the castle rooftop. Actually quite a fun but preposterous movie and much better than I expected.

Overall, the film was well made.The bad. They should've spent more time building up the characters. We didn't get a really good sense of who anyone was. It was like we were supposed to know who they were based on their names and a few key details.They went a bit overboard, no pun intended, with the flying warships. For me that was just a step too far especially if you love the classic nature of the story. They also made the king look like a nincompoop.

47,Screen_Blitz,"Despite its sweet visuals, this adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's classic source material is a flop",4,3 April 2017,"At this point, it is almost difficult to count how many renditions of Alexandre Dumas's classic novel 'The Three Musketeers' Hollywood has spawned, with the last being a Disney adaptation back in the mid 1990s. Regardless, director Paul W. S. Anderson, notable for the the video game-inspired franchise 'Resident Evil', has strikes the silver screen with yet another adaptation of the classic source material. Boasting dazzling visuals and a somewhat stellar cast, this interpretation of Dumas's tale had open doors to for an entertaining, if not exhilarating family experience. But does it this movie hit that mark? Sadly not. Anderson's rendition of the classic story is too often flustered with over-the-top cartoonish style and is preyed upon by a spiritless script by Andrew Davis and Alex Vitvak. In the simplest of words, it's not much fun. So what is the story? The film follows three elite musketeers: Athos (played by Matthew MacFayden), Porthos (played by Ray Stevenson), and Aramis (played by Luke Evans), who have washed up from their formerly famed lives and are living an experience of utter monotony. When a young swordsman D'Artagan (played by Logan Lerman) sets out to Paris to join the elite team, the three musketeers find themselves facing the betrayal Milady De Winter (played by Milla Jovovich) who along with Duke of Buckingham (played by Orlando Bloom), becomes the accomplice of Cardinal Richelieu's (played by Christoph Waltz) to wage war on the French monarchy and steal the throne. So the elite swordsmen must band together to foil his diabolical plan.What does Paul W.S. Anderson have to offer for this extravagant swashbuckling adventure? It all starts with a solid introduction of the characters and setting up the mischievous Richelieu's convoluted plan to take over France and destroy our three main heroes as we know them. The production design of Renaissance-era France is nice to look at, employing a sweet Disney-esque visual imagery. But it is only a matter of time before the film gets increasingly dull before it even reaches its halfway point. While our heroes are somewhat likable, none of them particularly interesting in any way nor is the antagonist Cardinal Richelieu. And it certainly doesn't help when the half of these characters are tarnished with overly cartoonish performances that range between average to laughably over-the-top. The same should definitely be mentioned about the dialogue. Above all, these are not to say that Anderson doesn't open doors to a little excitement during the second half. Easily the film's highest point arrives during a floating boat battle sequences which mixes a few clock-punk elements and plenty of Michael Bay-style action-set pieces. And maybe I should not forget the final sword battle between Logan Lerman and Mads Mikkelson. The action can be fun, but only when it is not filmed in an out-of-place way that echoes the bullet-time sequences from the 'Resident Evil' movies (especially for a movie set during the Renaissance Age). Aside from these, the excitement falls pretty short.The Three Musketeers is a schlocky adaptation of Alexandre Dumas's classic story, with a soulless script and performances that simply don't mesh. Although the visuals and action sequences serve as small redeeming qualities, they can't save this movie from plunging into the realm of spiritless disappointment. Those who seek for a charming cinematic rendition of Dumas's source material are probably best looking elsewhere.",The Three Musketeers

50,t_atzmueller,"From all the dozens of Three Musketeer""-Films, this remains the most unnecessary ones.",2,20 February 2013,"Is it a sign of getting old when you start to dislike remakes? Sure, Alexander Dumas novel is a timeless classic, well worth to be presented to each new generation; it seems that on average there's a new ""The Three Musketeers"" film every ten years (not even counting the many European productions in the 50's and 60's, spin-offs and B-grade movies). If you're from my generation, Richard Lester's ""Three Musketeers"" is likely your ultimo rendition.That every generation should have their version of a classic doesn't mean that you must necessarily make a 'hip' or trendy movie out of it. Even Richard Lester was able to film his version without making references to The Beatles or 1970's affairs. Rachel Welch was still a damsel in distress and Faye Dunaway was still a lady, despite there having been emancipation long before 1973.Perhaps, like me, you've gotten tired of yet another remake and perhaps, like me, you found the last big-screen film in 1993 tiresome and as unnecessary at an extra row of toes. Still, having heard that the 2011 version would have a completely different storyline, (hence wouldn't be a remake of the Richard Lester movie) and being a ""completist"", I had myself lured into the cinema yet again. I should have saved that money.The most positive I can say about the film is that none of the actors – perhaps with the exception of Milla Jovovich and Till Schweiger, who really cannot help it – hammed it up as badly as the 1993 version. Decent routine as you'd expect it from Hollywood pros. As always Christoph Waltz sticks out with excelsior but that only reminds us that, sadly, actors of this calibre are rare in our time and age. Oliver Reed, Michael York, Christopher Lee, Frank Finlay – Richard Lester's version had a whole film full of them.What really stinks is the storyline itself. I doubt that anybody involved in the screenplay has ever touched any of Dumas' works. It rather seems as if they just went with a checklist through the most popular popcorn films over the last few years, ""3D: check"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean: check"", ""Matrix: check"", etc. Glue this list together, connect the points by the skeleton of an adventure storyline and you got the product ""The Three Musketeers"".At least, by estimation, that will be it for ""The Three Musketeers"" for the next odd-decade – enough time to re-watch some of the more obscure versions like ""The Fifth Musketeer""; still infinitely better than this CGI-animated product.",The Three Musketeers
51,CinematicInceptions,Entertaining slop.,7,22 August 2017,"While I must admit that I enjoyed this movie very much at twelve years old seeing it in theaters, I cannot sing many praises for it now. It has about as much raw entertainment as is possible for any movie and shamelessly models itself off of Pirates of the Caribbean, which is a major reason why I did and in a way still do enjoy it. I don't want to assume that the people who worked on it did not care about the movie at all, but it seems like more than one somebody was much more concerned with making the movie cool and fun rather than any kind of work of art. And in some ways that's fine, but it does reflect poorly on practically everyone involved.At first glance, it might seem like the plot was thrown aside, but I don't think that's the case. Much of the source material is throw aside to be sure, as the movie follows the content of the first eight or so chapters of the original book and takes vast liberties with it to boot (namely the airmachine). But there was a pretty involved plot that was constructed here that seems like there was a lot of work put into it. Where it falls flat is how the plot was put into script form. It has no evident theme and abandons more realistic or effective scenes in favor of setting up action scenes. The same goes for the dialogue, much of which you won't hear because of the atrocious sound editing in the conversational scenes.The characters are pretty much all one or two-dimensional people with memorable personalities. All of them are little more than your textbook flamboyant heroes, sinister villains, damsels in distress, duplicitous double-crossers, and bumbling comic relief. Nobody aside from Athos and *maybe* D'Artagnan has any sort of arc. Despite the huge cast, nobody gives a great performance, although James Corden's current notoriety may be attributed in part to his performance as Planchett.The action scenes are exciting and over-the-top with a lot of sword fighting and cannon fire. The four against forty battle is largely inflated from the matching scene in the book. Originally, it was four on five and the musketeers all get injured in the fight. I'm not saying that to complain, just pointing out what sort of movie they decided to make here. It may be fun to see our heroes and villains annihilate a bunch of inept minions, but where's the drama or suspense in that?My main recommendation is this: don't expect a great piece of filmmaking or a life changing story, but also know that you probably won't be bored watching it. I have two last bones to pick. First, there was way too much cleavage shown. Keep the corsets for historical accuracy if you have to, but that doesn't mean you have to look down a woman's dress every time she's in a shot. Secondly, the speech Athos gives D'Artagnan near the end about ""France taking care of itself"". It's such a selfish way of making decisions that I can hardly believe they kept it in.

Anyway, I could think of one hundred million better ways to spend one hundred million dollars, but for what it is, a high budget version of the classic, I guess it's okay. There's lots of action, some love interest, some Wild Wild West sci-fi special effects, some Indiana Jones booby trapping, some okay performances including that of bad guy Christoph Waltz of Water For Elaphants fame (yeah, the guy from Inglorious Baserds). Milla Jovovich seems a bit awkward out of her Resident Evil role. I just couldn't believe she could fly though the air around National Treasure type of traps and gadgets outside of the zombie fantasy world, but that's what made me take three points off. I thought she was sexy as the hero in those movies, but just boring as the villain in this one. All in all, you get what you pay for.

Yet a middleman Lord Buckingham, (Orlando Bloom), a self centred ego maniac who plans to have peace talks with King Louise XIII (Freddie Fox)to stop the endless cycle of war. Needless to say the cardinal of France (Christolph Waltz) does not like the idea of peace and decides to set up Lord Buckingham by the use of Milady D'winter (milla Jovovich) to plant a rare necklace in his vault in London Tower. This will provide the necessary means to kick start Louis to declare war against england, with the cardinal as king, provided that he makes Louis look like an idiot. It is a rare treat to see such movies make it to the theatres over what is becoming a mainstay of needless violence. I do like sci-fi and good thrillers. But todays movies are lacking something by means of emotions. Most films now a days lack the lustre when shown, it is more violence and action that is overtaking the young minds. It's as if they say who cares about a bravado film like the three musketeers? I want blood, fire, destruction. The rest can sit on the back burner. Not so. I love this film, a good action film, with proper attitudes to life, no kind of ridiculous flash bang genre that is mainstream now.

54,willcundallreview,A drab affair full of crazy action,4,3 May 2014,"Rating-4/10The Three Musketeers is an Action/Adventure film that never lives up to the tale we so often get to see and starts to become a pretty poor movie by the end. It does however have big budget action and a cast that you wouldn't expect to be in this film at all and with some big action sequences and more, they do an OK job here, well kind of how much you can do with such a story like this. I found this film to be safely very poor and here below is why I felt that.The story is just too complicated and stuffed full of outlandish stupidity and it goes way too fast to be a film with any meaning. I also felt the film thinks it is being a serious film but in the end turns into a farce of stupid ideas and the film just didn't have to do certain things to be a good film. You will see the airships in this film and think ""Oh my this film is insane"" because there was just no need and took the story of the Musketeers to a whole new level, that wasn't a higher level.Logan Lerman is meant to be the main character of D'Artagnan in this but the entire Musketeers team kind of become the main characters instead, he does a very average job as do all the Musketeers and not one stands out at all. The are not established either and there backgrounds are just not given away enough and they disappear quicker than they arrived. Christoph Waltz hit a new low with this movie as he usually a fantastic actor and evidence is he can win Oscars, but he fails to do well here and along with Orlando Bloom as the other villain and also Milla Jovovich they are just never up to the job at any time in this movie.This film's weakest point is in writing not just the plot and the script just never does anything to help this movie, it is just plainly not good. Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't absolutely fail in the directing chair but he also can't do anything to make this film good either, and as producer he maybe should have looked elsewhere in hindsight. The effects aren't always bad but I will say they are never very good and overused at times when they could have just written in much better things that would work at a much cheaper production cost.The film isn't actually awful or to be fair a BAD movie, but it is far far far from good, It does have some good fighting I guess and the ending of this movie doesn't actually end that bad among all the craziness going on. I enjoyed one part with the(POSSIBLE SPOILER) airship that the musketeers command and the weapons used on it are fantastic and they really do jump that part up among what us pretty much a very drab movie.Those who enjoy the story of the Musketeers will be bitterly disappointed I feel and should go watch the 73 or 93 version as this is no good remake. It could pass as bearable movie watching for those wanting an out and out crazy film which to be fair has lots of action and provides you with not thrills but a sense that you actually want the Musketeers to do well rather than just leave the movie in the first 5 minutes. I will also add this is an alright film for younger kids as it isn't too dark and the lighter themes carry on throughout the entire film really.Overall I give this a 4/10 meaning it is safely a Very Poor movie, as I said not awful but nowhere near at all being good. You can tell by the end they wanted some sort of franchise from this movie but it was never going to happen with such crazy ideas and stunts going on, a bigger budget perhaps and a whole new team of writers might have saved this but it just never can be considered very good. I will also add that this is bearable to watch and give it a look and see what you think yourself, who knows what you might think of it.",The Three Musketeers

56,Brooklynsmagicmike,While visually stunning and enjoyable overall it could definitely been better.,7,10 December 2020,I'm little late to the party here as I just saw this for the first time. But I'll be the first to admit while I'm familar with The Three Muskeeters. This film was first I've seen out of any of them.While I did like the movie there were quite few areas it was lacking in that prevented it from being better in my opinion.The movie was filled with great actors yet squandered some of them. By either under utilizing them or simply not developing their character enough. I also felt the movie at times got a bit draggy especially towards the middle and some scenes just felt like they were filler placed into overbloat the film. Lastly I felt the humor in the film fell largely flat and was awkward.Aside from those issues the film had good amount of action in it. It also had some extremely stunning visuals and for movie 9 years old it could compete easyly with movies of this current era. I did also think direction film took was enjoyable and followable.Overall I would recommend the film. I don't think the reviewers panning it heavy were accurate with there assessment and feel they just overally picked film apart for every little thing.,The Three Musketeers
57,Chris_Pandolfi,I Don't Think Dumas Had Airships in Mind,5,26 October 2011,"""The Three Musketeers"" plays less like an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas' original novel and more like a test drive for a new historical video game. Indeed, it was directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, whose career is in part defined by films based on video games (""Mortal Kombat,"" ""Alien vs. Predator,"" the first and third ""Resident Evil"" films with another one on the way). It's not the deviations that bother me; I truly could not care less how unfaithful a film is from its source so long as I'm being entertained. What bothers me is the simple-mindedness with which the story is told. This new ""The Three Musketeers"" – with its exaggerated stunt work, silly steampunk special effects, and awful twenty-first century dialogue – is an adequate film for fifteen-year-old gamers who have not seen any previous adaptation, never read the novel, and barely glanced at the CliffNotes.The film has been shot and released in 3D. Perhaps it depends on the theater, but in my particular case, viewing it that way required a projection filter that dimmed the picture substantially, more so than for any film I've seen in 3D. The colors were faded and muddy. The bright scenes looked hazy, as if I was viewing them through a scrim. The dark scenes were just shy of unwatchable. On top of all that, the 3D is itself not all that immersive. If you see it in traditional 2D (and I strongly suggest you do), you may actually appreciate how good the film looks. The costumes are ornate, the sets are opulent, and although inappropriate from a narrative and historical standpoint, the computer graphics are detailed and convincing. If only an effort had been made with the screenplay and some of the casting choices; maybe then the film could have worked as escapist fun, irrespective of the fact that Dumas never conceived of cannon-blasting airships planned by Leonardo Da Vinci, secret passages that open with hidden switches, and concealed vaults booby trapped with darts.Aspects of the plot should be familiar by now. Taking place in the seventeenth century, we meet the Three Musketeers – Athos (Matthew Macfayden), Porthos (Ray Stevenson), and Aramis (Luke Evans) – a fighting company for the French monarchy. Once the pride of their country, their last mission was a failure, and they were forced to disband. Athos is drunk who, since being betrayed by his lover, doesn't believe in anything anymore. Porthos is broke and is occasionally slipped some money by wealthy women. Aramis, a clergyman, remains a man of God but has separated himself from the Church. Into their lives enters a young peasant named D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman), who travels to Paris to become a Musketeer, like his father once was. Headstrong and quick-tempered, he isn't chivalrous so much as cocky, challenging dangerous people to duels. Such a person is Captain Rochefort (Mads Mikkelson), who made the impertinent gesture of insulting D'Artagnan's horse.In due time, all four of them become embroiled in a case of international intrigue. It begins with the self-serving Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich), who broke Athos' heart by double crossing the Musketeers and selling the airship blueprints they stole from Venice to England's Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). She's now in league with Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz), who plots to manufacture a war between France and England and take control away from the sniveling, foppish King Louis XIII (Freddie Fox). This will involve stealing a necklace from Louis' young wife, Queen Anne (Juno Temple). It's up to the Musketeers and D'Artagnan to retrieve the necklace before France is plunged into chaos.It's not so much an issue of plot, although a cannonball fight in the clouds is admittedly ridiculous, as is an impossibly elaborate swordfight on the rooftops and buttresses of Notre Dame Cathedral. It's more a matter of dialogue and characterization, which were thoughtlessly handled. Characters like King Louis, with his overplayed eye for fashion and hilariously unconvincing attraction to his wife, is a desperately broad caricature that serves as nothing other than comedy relief. Milady could have been intriguing were it not for the miscasting of Jovovich; she's not a bad actress, and she certainly looks sexy enough, but she lacks the sophistication (and the accent) necessary for this role. The Musketeers themselves are decent enough, but there's something off about D'Artagnan, and again, I think it's a matter of casting. Lerman, fresh-faced though he may be, brings no passion to the role. He comes off as impudent, reckless, and, despite some well-choreographed swordfights, not at all heroic.During certain action scenes, Anderson relies on a technique that made his previous film, ""Resident Evil: Afterlife,"" very annoying. He has specific shots of stunt work play in slow motion, presumably in an effort to make them more dramatic – and, of course, to enhance the 3D process, since they're often superimposed with images of flying objects, mostly swords. It's a reasonable idea, but the way he handles it, it comes off as a gimmick. Also consider a shot in which Athos fires a cannonball; the camera follows up close it as it flies through the air; we can even see the fuse sparkling away. Does Anderson really want us to scrutinize these kinds of details? Or is he merely satisfying his desire for mindless action and special effects? Maybe I'm asking for too much, but I believe that even a dumbed-down, revisionist version of ""The Three Musketeers"" deserves more than that.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",The Three Musketeers
58,kevinxirau,This was...interesting.,6,23 October 2011,"I'll always love the 90s version of this classic tale. It had the best cast, story, action, etc. Now to be fair, this new one has a lot of potential to it: thrilling scenes, some recognizable actors/actresses, and so on so forth. Was it all worth it? Um, somewhat.Good points: Cool protagonists, which had some nice updates to them. Each of the Three Musketeers have their own unique qualities and strategies while d'Artagnan is a little more skilled with a sword. There is a decent amount of humor that goes around throughout the plot. Great action scenes and an interesting plot also what give this movie a thumbs up.Bad points: There were a few rather cheesy moments and certain dialogue was pretty bland. The biggest fault this movie has is the king himself. I have never seen a more ridiculous character in a Three Musketeers movie than this little twerp! He is so annoying and clueless that he makes you wanna kill yourself. I Am NOT Kidding! The king in the 90s film was much more perceptive , much braver (even if he is a little shy), and was able to stand up for himself unlike this blithering idiot. God Almighty smite this sucker from the face of the earth.What surprised me was that some characters had larger roles like Milady and even the Duke of Buckingham while others were downplayed like the Cardinal and that one-eyed dude. Still, for all its faults, this movie is still decent and if you want to see it, then be my guest.",The Three Musketeers
59,Tcarts76,A poor version of a tired tale,5,27 September 2012,"So 2011 brings us another version of the classic tale of the three musketeers and a wannabe young hot head. This movie brings nothing new to the tale and is completely over done and weak at best. The acting is, well, OK considering that this tired old tale is always over the top.This one goes bad the way Will Smith's ""Wild Wild West"" does. Overblown comedy, and the jumping the shark addition of technology that doesn't belong in the period. It also contains some of the old kung fu movie, flying fight scenes that are completely out of place and just plain stink. The only bright note through the movie is in the form of the one of the evil, sexy villains, Milady De Winter played by Milla Jovovich. She sizzles and shows all the sex appeal that most of her other films are completely lacking. If fact her scenes are the only ones worth watching.To make a bad film even worse they try to fit in even another comedic love story between King Louis and his wife who although married have a clear lack of romantic ability to consummate. The 1993 version with Charlie Sheen, although not a great film, manages to still be better than this version, so watch that one instead. Note to future directors, why doesn't someone remake this film as a dark more realistic story that may actually have a chance of being slightly original and making people actually like the story again. Then again most people could care less with a movie that has anything to do with the useless, arrogant French these days. I mean they have a love for Jerry Lewis, and made that fat boy Gerard Depardieu a star for crying out loud.Like my reviews? Hate em? Comments, or have a DVD you would like to see reviewed?

60,ssvikas,"Relies more on special effects than storytelling, yet watchable",6,19 October 2011,"Based on Alexander Dumas' popular french story, this is at least the fourth cinematic venture. The previous ones had released in 1948, 1973 and 1993 and if this one were to succeed, it had to offer something unprecedented. Therefor, Director Paul WS Anderson relies on special effects to do the magic for him. Following Dumas' novel, it's the story of a poor nobleman d'Artagnan who comes to Paris to carry on his father's legacy by joining the famed musketeers. But don't expect it follow the book. The film is actually an oversimplified version. While the plot intricacies have been guillotined, what remains is only stylized action.On the brighter side, the special effects are very well done even in a 2D version. I'm sure the 3D may have been even more engaging. The Airships are extraneous to the story but manage to create a spectacle on screen. The duel on the Notre-Dame rooftop and the animated map of Europe for scene continuity are worth a mention. The three musketeers played by Matthew Macfadyen as Athos, Ray Stevenson as Porthos and Luke Evans as Aramis look tired and practically didn't have much to do except wearily accompany d'Artagnan and get their hands dirty in an occasional battle. Their weariness is explained by a failed mission, thanks to Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) who plays a double agent and Athos' treacherous love interest. About Jovovich, the lesser said the better. For one, she tries excessively hard to play sensuous. Her stunts are akin to Resident Evil series also starring Jovovich directed by Anderson. There are also stunts inspired by Mission Impossible and Entrapment after she sheds her clothes atop a terrace, an unlikely event in 17th century Europe. Her prominence can be explained by the fact that she is the director's wife. Rather than Jovovich, it is the British model and actress Gabriella Wilde who plays Constance Bonacieux, d'Artagnan's love interest who steals the show in the looks department. In the lead, Logan Lerman does well as the cocky but courageous d'Artagnan. Those that play the french king and queen are insignificant.Among the other stars, Christoph Waltz who drew critical acclaim and an Oscar for his portrayal as Col Hans Landa in 'Inglorious Basterds' plays the scheming Cardinal Richelieu. But, it is his henchman Rochefort that grabs more screen time and action and is played by Mads Mikkelsen, the bond villain from Casino Royale (2006).To put it all in a nutshell, 'Three Musketeers' has action, charm of a fictional historic tale, death defying stunts involving airships and occasional humor. If you are keen shut your mind to its pitfalls, it works well as a decent entertainer.",The Three Musketeers
61,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Wasn't expecting a faithful adaptation and yet...,3,27 July 2012,"I still felt disappointed.It just felt too silly at times. The dialogue was cheesy. The actor that played the King was over-acting. And when The Duke of Buckingham shows up in his air ship, everyone acts like that is the most normal thing in the world. If I saw a flying air ship in this day and age I wouldn't go around having a normal conversation, I would be like ""WTF is that?"" With my mouth agape. It also bugged me that half the people had British accents and the other half American. Again, it's not like I was expecting everyone to attempt a french accent. But pick SOMETHING and stick to it for continuity's sake.There are some really cool fight scenes. And I love all the gorgeous costumes and set designs. But there just really isn't much going on. I couldn't be bothered to finish the thing.",The Three Musketeers
62,blrnani,Parody of a classic,6,30 January 2018,"Many people have a reverence for these classic Dumas works and imho the definitive rendition was the David Lean series. Consequently, they will find the title of this hodgepodge of a film rather misleading, as it only provides a very loose framework to hang the stories on. I say 'stories' because there are several going on simultaneously, which makes things a bit confusing, especially as the logic that is supposed to hold such things together too often gets jettisoned.
First of all, this is a 'director's wife' vehicle, so Mila Jovovitch gets to do her Resident Evil tricks in a 17thC context.
But it is also a teen hearthrob vehicle for Logan Lerman, so we get all the brash arrogance one would expect from the leading figure in a high-school play.
And then there's the HK martial arts, Matrix and PotC action that is the dominant feature of the film. 
The cast is actually good, but somewhat wasted as they are basically connecting elements to keep the action flowing.
Anyway, I think if one is forewarned that this film is a comedy that merely uses the subject matter as a loose structure, much as the Monty Python team used the Arthurian legend and the Bible, then it will be far more enjoyable than expecting another rendering of the Three Musketeers story.
Whether you can get round the technological abuses is another matter - as it takes us into Connecticut Yankee territory. I really don't see where they can go from that closing sequence, as it would suggest a complete rewriting of European history, or a sudden updating to a WWII-type scenario, with the musketeers leading French resistance to the hated British occupying power (who consider that they're merely taking back the Norman territories that were stolen from them).",The Three Musketeers
63,headly66,A pile of garbage,1,7 February 2012,"Classic story directed like it's Mission Impossible. Seems no one can make an action movie today without a billion explosions and nonstop cuts and poor plots. This movie is an absolute waste of time, avoid at all costs. It has nothing to do with the Dumas characters, the time period it is shot in or anything based in reality. Suddenly 17th century people are Ninjas and high tech weapon wizards, none of this is factual. Ham handed acting, implausible script and silly language. Can someone please make a real historical action/drama/comedy or anything that is not in 3D and nauseatingly childish? They ruined Sherlock Holmes and now The Three Musketeers. I guess I can't expect much from the director of Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat.There were no manned balloons in the 1600's - let alone airships with cannons.",The Three Musketeers
64,julian-mumford,A disappointing albeit colourful romp,4,5 April 2012,"That sound you hear is author Alexandre Dumas slowly rotating in his eternal resting place, such is the extensive re-imagining of his original novel. Director Paul Anderson retaining the name and characters but little else of the original story.The Three musketeers Aramis (Luke Evans), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Athos (Matthew Macfayden) serve at the pleasure of the weak French King (Freddie Fox). Having retrieved Leonardo Da Vinci's secret blueprints for a ""Flying War Machine"", they find themselves out maneuvered by Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) and Milady (Mila Jovovich).The trio meanwhile occupy themselves by getting drunk, eating and chasing the occasional French Maid. Meanwhile young D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) dreams of becoming a Musketeer, leaving his bucolic rural based family for the den of inequity that is Paris.D'Artagnan manages to rub everyone up the wrong way, challenging people to a duel every second stride. Having initially narrowly missing a skewering by the leader of Richelieu's guard, Captain Rocheford (Mads Mikkelsen), D'Artagnan arranges to then duel all three Musketeers individually for minor infractions.Before you can say, just kill the cocky annoying little bugger and be done with it, more of Richelieu's guards turn up. This enables our quartet to join forces and engage in some PG rated swash buckling, with more never ending bad guys to be cut down, than a Call of Duty video game.Once the film establishes that the quartet can do what they like, kill lots of guards and seemingly be rewarded for their efforts, the film reveals the courtly machinations of Cardinal Richelieu. This involves using Lord Buckinghamshire (Bloom) to provoke a war with England and more double crosses than a John Le Carre novel.Waltz as ever plays the bad guy to the hilt, Bloom looks uncomfortable which is understandable because no-one gets a chance to actually act. On occasion they do try but all concerned give performances appropriate for very large and expensive school play. Pantomime buffoonery is obviously the directors chosen approach, lob in a few CGI airships and voila, the film is a colourful mess. Interestingly, has there ever been a decent film that employs airships, Pixar's ""Up"" being an exception.Most of the blame must surely lie with the directors lack of confidence in the material, the start is OK and young D'Artagnan apart, character interaction is reasonable and despite the early critical mauling the film received, you think maybe it's not so bad. Then, as if everyone believed that this would never be enough, the director abandons all pretence of reality and heads off into ""CGI Green Screen"" hell, where little or no acting is expected or possible.Lerman decides to play his character as American as a hotdog and when the inevitable love interest appears, the admittedly pretty young Queens maid, she could not appear more American if ""Apple Pie"" was written on both arms, is this story at least nominally set in France? Interesting note, Bavaria in Germany stands in quite effectively for Versailles and the village set scenes. Only in the movies would we have, Americans attempting to be French, whilst filming in Germany.Whilst there is some minor fun to be had, with the talent and money on display, this could and should have been so much more. Whilst a sequel is obviously set up in the closing credits, there may be more honour for all concerned to merely say Adieu.Summary A disappointing albeit colourful romp, using the characters Alexandre Dumas created merely as a starting point for a sub standard ""Raiders"" style adventure. Add in a measure of any swash buckling movie ever seen, all generously mixed with an early Elizabethan Episode of ""Black Adder"" and you get the general idea.Largely to be avoided unless airships quite literally float your boat.",The Three Musketeers
65,domtaylor,Not Worth It But Not The Worst,5,16 February 2012,"'The Three Musketeers'was a film that was clearly a waste of my valuable time. The main reason I gave it a 5 was because not much happened but also I didn't fall asleep or leave the room.It wasn't the worst time waster I've seen so any ratings less than 4 out of 10 wouldn't be correct in my opinion but neither would any ratings over 6 out of 10.The majority of the film was just talking full stop. The best scene was near the beginning- it was a fight scene between many people. Rather unusually,this film,being the three musketeers,had hardly any action scenes and the storyline was hard to get,extremely boring and SO plain.Basically, I would recommend not to watch this film or even rent it because you may as well get an original 'The Three Musketeers' film.It is better than 'The last airbender',though, which is another adventure film.",The Three Musketeers

Bearing absolutely no relation to the Dumas novel {except for the names of the characters} this new version seems to have been made for contemporary audiences, and combines elements of ""Matrix""' ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""James Bond films, Samurai films and even throws in a good deal of steampunk gadgets and weapons. The story has something to do with a plan for Cardinal Richilieu to seize power and set himself up as a dictator. The cast is OK,with Orlando Bloom as the evil Buckingham, Mila Jojovich as a deadly assassin, and Christof Walz as Richileiu. The German locations could easily pass for early 17 th century France and are quite beautiful.There are fine swordfights, improvised weapon systems, secret passageways,a killing chamber, booby traps, an unbelievable swordfight duel on the roof of Notre Dame cathedral and stolen plans from Leonardo Da Vinci's secret vault for aeriel war machines. These are a combination of zeppelins and sail propelled galleons with at least three decks of cannons and flamethrowers! Even if they are at least 200 years ahead of their time, they are magnificent in design . Their battle over Paris is truly spectacular. Film also features many funny and quite quotable one liners. The point of it is that this was designed to be a fun film and if you, the viewer ""get it"" it will be exactly that. I've never seen an Andreson film, but this one was a blast. Its all non stop action with a keen sense of humor and some spectacular set pieces all in eye popping 3D.Definitely not your 8th grade Dumas book report that you probably faked by reading a ""Classic Illustrated"" comic version or ""Cliff Notes"", but its not supposed to be.

69,chaz-28,The cast play cartoon characters & the script may have been written on a napkin,2,25 October 2011,"Another Three Musketeers movie. The producers were having a brainstorming session one day and one of them jokingly said, ""You know what we haven't had in a few years? A Three Musketeers movie!"" Then another one chimes in with ""Oooh, and this time there will be maximum CGI and make it in 3D so we can up the price on the suckers who actually see this thing in a theater."" Or, perhaps Paul W.S. Anderson got tired of making Resident Alien 12 and wanted to take a break.For this new iteration of a very old story, Hollywood didn't even break a sweat this time. The Three Musketeers, Athos (Matthew MacFadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson), and Aramis (Luke Evans) are down on their luck and drinking heavily in Paris after they were betrayed on their last job by Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) and the dastardly Duck of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) breezes into town from the countryside ready for adventure and there you have it, everyone is ready once again to go through the motions of the Musketeers.Poor Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz). In history, he is credited with creating the modern nation-state and truly putting France on the map as a world power. Unfortunately, whenever a Musketeers movie comes out, he is the sinister wizard behind the curtain pulling the strings of the young King Louis (Freddie Fox). What is Christoph Waltz doing in this movie? He won an Oscar two years ago for Inglourious Basterds and could pick his next scripts. He picked this one? I know actors say it is also more fun to play the villain, but why a cartoon character? Most of the cast in this film play their characters as cartoons. Orlando Bloom, Logan Lerman, and Freddie Fox are the worst offenders. Just because the script is horrible and the dialogue is atrocious does not give you license to pretend you're in a pantomime theater. The relentless overacting, menacing scowls, and campy one-liners from these three are appalling. The Musketeers themselves actually play their characters with purpose and a level of seriousness, except for Ray Stevenson. MacFadyen and Luke Evans are actually quite good as Athos and Aramis and it is a shame their talents are weighted down with the rest of the cast who are taking a break from their careers here.Most of the action and movement in The Three Musketeers is special effects laden and every now and then the script allows for an actual scene of dialogue or a sword fighting scene which appears to have not been shot in front a green screen. These are very brief though and then are interrupted with ridiculous looking air ships which have the world's first air to air engagement on top of Notre Dame. As the film dragged on, I became thankful for these preposterous action scenes just to take the screen away from D'Artagnan, the Duke of Buckingham, and the worst offender of them all, the young King Louis.Also, because The Three Musketeers is intent in failing in every single aspect it can, it ends with one of those horrible scenes which set it up for a sequel; that is if this one makes enough money the first time around.",The Three Musketeers

71,AzSumTuk,I had a lot of fun with it but...,5,17 January 2012,"I love the original novel. The creators of this movie butchered the story with a rusty ax. However I knew that at the second I saw the trailer and I still decided to see the movie. It looked like good fun.And it was good fun. I didn't have any problem with the fact that they didn't adapt the story. Hollywood movie makers never do it with this particular novel, I don't know why.What I did have problems with is the fact that the movie builds a lot of expectations but doesn't really live up to them. I guess when you saw Milady's incredible fighting abilities in the trailer you thought she would be a vital part of The Final Battle. Well, she isn't. She disappears long before that. There is one more important character who shows incredible fighting abilities in one training session but doesn't use them anywhere else. The airship battle is spectacular but ends absolutely nowhere. The actual final battle is well choreographed but something is missing. The feeling of epic epicness that one would get from a real final battle is just not there - instead we see just a casual sword fight between D'Artagnan and Rochefort. It would be nice in the middle of the movie but doesn't work as a culmination. And the story ends with a huge cliffhanger, and I hate it when that happens in a movie. Now I will have to wait at least a year before the sequel comes out, if it ever does...The story itself is cobbled from the original novel, random martial arts movies and something from the TV-show ""Leverage"". Athos, Porthos and Aramis are rather ninjas than musketeers. Milady is a ninja too. :) And there are airships. Well...

73,jantoniou,Entertaining but utterly improbable,5,31 May 2012,"This yet-another-version of The Three Musketeers at first felt like it had a lot going for it. The period quality was actually very nice and clearly tops, budget-wise. They were CGI-ing the Paris of the 18th century - to be expected - but otherwise it felt quite genuine. Make it grimy, muddy, and a bit dark and dank and you'll probably feel like it really was the actual century the original Dumas' novel was set in. But, eventually, they blew it. Paul W.S. Anderson, who has a well-deserved reputation as a schlock director, let his desire to turn this into an action-adventure schlock-fest force the film into a series of bizarre turns. We end up seeing completely out-of-place floating warships that we're made to believe AREN'T actually out-of-place because they were built from Leonardo DaVinci's original drawings of these warships. We're supposed to believe that even though DaVinci conceived of and drew up the plans for a ship that the technology existed to actually build it? Riiiight. They use these warships as foundation for much of the story and that's where the movie really sags. You're setting the central action of this movie around hardware that wouldn't and couldn't have existed in the original? And you don't even try to make the inherent improbability of this even fun or funny? There's great humor and the actors chosen for Athos, Porthos and Aramis are good to great. Ultimately, however, I wanted them used for something more meaningful than the silliness of a bunch of fictional flying warships.As Milady Dewinter, Milla Jovovich plays her as a true psychopath (though I'm sure she was written that way). She seems largely unfeeling and kills and schemes against others seemingly without compunction, forethought, or a moral compass of any kind. She does not garner any sympathy whatsoever. Also, she had a strange way of chewing on her dialogue. It looked as though Jovovich had some kind of plastic surgery and didn't look or sound quite right. Orlando Bloom as Lord Buckingham is genuinely bad in his role. He does not do villain well. I mostly want to laugh at rather than hate him. He also seemed to have a fake accent and I wanted to slap him for his attempts to be mean or menacing. SPOILER warning: There's some genuinely stupid liberties taken in the movie. Ones where you just scratch your head and go ""huh?"" For example, after Lord Buckingham improbably builds DaVinci's floating warship (after the Musketeers are double-crossed and DaVinci's plans are stolen from them by Diwinter and Buckingham), the head of the Cardinal's guard, Rochefort, somehow manages to very quickly build his own much larger and more powerful version. How they do this without plans is not explained. It just shows up and starts fighting, thus setting up the ridiculous warship-on-warship action sequences. Also (another SPOILER), Milady Dewinter jumps off the flying warship after being captured by the Musketeers. By any reasonable estimation she falls at least a few thousand feet into the ocean. So - she's dead, right? Nope! Last scene of the movie she was impossibly ""fished out of the water"" by Buckingham who in turn - in another impossible sequence - is going after the Musketeers with dozens of floating and airborne warships. It's never explained or made clear why he needs that much hardware to defeat a small group of plucky Frenchmen. This also attempts to prepare us for what we're supposed to believe will be a sequel to this rather schlocky and lame version of the Musketeers. One more thing that's ridiculous. Early in the movie the Musketeers, hoping to head off Buckingham and get to ""DaVinci's vault"" (no relationship to Capone's) and steal his plan for the floating warship before he gets to it escape from the vault by blowing up the ceiling above it, which in turn draws in the canal waters of Venice into the vault thereby by destroying everything in the vault. Yes, they destroy all of DaVinci's priceless, genius notebooks just to get away. Ugh. I know it's just a movie, but thank you, Director Anderson. The film is in other ways redeeming. The sword-fight sequences were good. Freddie Fox as Louis XIII is quite a hilarious and absurd choice for the boy King. The sheer volume of ridiculous outfits he wears is a joy. Speaking of outfits, the wardrobe at the very least for the movie must be HIGHLY commended. They did an absolute A-level job on making the costumes and must have had a fleet of seamstresses and costumers. Milady Dewinter - in addition to the King - goes through seemingly dozens of beautifully made dresses and outfits. They're all quite beautiful and stunning, even when, in the King's case, they're utterly silly. The Musketeers and D'Artagnan are all good and the actress playing D'Artagnan's love interest (Gabriella Wilde) is spectacularly, supermodel- level beautiful. She shines on the screen. While she considers D'Artagnan a country rube she somehow ignores this after he saves the day a few times. I guess being a super-swashbuckler is all it takes these days to win over the uber-hot chick. I think this is worth a rental. I wouldn't have seen this in the movie theater's, but rental, yes. It's entertaining to a degree and there's some funny moments for sure. But, for historical accuracy and general quality, there's much better versions out there.",The Three Musketeers
74,EchoMaRinE,pretty good action,8,30 April 2012,"I was actually going through an IMDb list and saw the rating of this movie as 5.8 so I felt the urge to write a review. I read some comments and it seems there was witch hunt for this nice and entertaining movie. It is not the best movie of 2011 but come on, it is much better than a lot of movies that have way higher ratings. First of all, the action is pretty good. The acting is very well done and the CGI is used professionally. This is a modern approach to the classic three musketeers and I enjoyed it a lot. From my point of view, a remake needs to add some stuff to the original movie and this movie made it successfully.",The Three Musketeers
75,FilmFanatic03,Seriously?,2,15 November 2011,"Trash! I am using an American word because in this film they spoke in American accents....WHEN IT IS SET IN France! Honestly! don't people care about authenticity anymore?! I would give it one star but it's surprisingly good storyline allows it to be given another star. Logan Lerman as D'artagnan is the major anchor in the cause for this film to stop becoming a good film! With his fake looking wig, he brings the most unashamedly American attitude to the film when he is meant to be a humble French farmer boy in search of becoming a hero! All the actors managed to deliver such cheesy and disgraceful lines which could destroy ones careers! Using words like ""cocky"" and a couple of swear words was just stupid since they wouldn't have used words like those back in the day! The only stand out performance was James Corden...now that says something about the quality of the film! But like I said before, the storyline makes you at least want to stay until the end of the film. In a period drama piece you either use English accents or English language with a French accent! Not with an American accent!!! They could have done a much better job, the story was there but the acting and scriptwriting was not",The Three Musketeers
76,davidfurlotte,Remember when movies were made that depended on actors?,2,14 January 2012,"This movie is not one of those. Matter of fact, it seems Hollywood has decided that they don't really need actors anymore since they now have CGI and 3D and other effects to play with.To say that this movie was an adaptation of the novel by Alexandre Dumas would be akin to saying ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a documentary about Piracy in the 1800s.****Yes there be spoilers**** It has been said by others in their reviews that it reminded them of ""Wild Wild West"" and that is exactly what I was thinking as well, change out the airship with the giant mechanical spider and you have the same idea.I had to laugh when I read about some of the ""goofs"" because someone was talking about Buckingham playing with a butterfly knife that was 75 years ahead of its time. Really? That was your big complaint about realism? How about the killer lasers that were used to protect the Queen's Jewels? At least in ""Wild Wild West"" they tried to explain the technology and tie it in with what was available, here they just forgot to show the time machine they used to go get some tech from the future.With that being said, this movie does have some funny parts and is entertaining if for nothing more than just laughing at some of the silliness, but if you want historical or accurate to the plot of the book, you need to go back and read the real thing or watch some of the movies that were made when Hollywood producers didn't have so many toys to play with.If it weren't for Ray Stevenson playing the part of Porthos I would have given this movie one star.",The Three Musketeers
77,jmmustchin,A lot of fun,10,17 October 2018,"The Three Musketeers is not meant to be an overly serious, historically accurate or literal-to-the-book movie. It's meant to be a very fun action-adventure film, and it succeeds very much as that. The movie is set in the early 1600s, during the reign of King Louis XIII of France and the regency of Cardinal Richelieu. In England, King James I is on the throne, and the Duke of Buckingham is regent. That's where the historical resemblance ends, and if you go into the movie comparing it to reality, you'll come out quite disappointed. When enjoyed purely for what it is, it's a lot of fun. D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman) is a young Gascon who wants to join the Musketeers. On the way to France, he gets involved in a dispute with Captain Rochefort - whom D'Artagnan doesn't realise is the captain of the Cardinal's guard. Milady (another Cardinal agent) saves D'Artagnan from death. Once he reaches Paris, he finds that the Musketeers have disbanded, and that the Cardinal is plotting against the king. The movie is very exciting and a lot of fun. It has a great sense of humour. For a movie set in the 1600s, there are a lot of special effects (although I won't spoil why they're needed - let's just say there's a science fiction element). I also LOVE the music score. Overall, a very good movie, and the best Musketeers adaption I've yet seen.",The Three Musketeers
78,slayerjmk95,"A Fun, Action-Packed Tale",8,22 April 2012,"There have been numerous adaptations of Alexandre Dumas' tale of The Three Musketeers, but none as strange or over-the-top as Paul W.S. Anderson's version. Yes, the script may be flawed and clichéd at parts, and sometimes the movie just feels a little dull at parts, but that doesn't stop the great, goofy fun that is The Three Musketeers.I've seen quite a few adaptations of the Musketeers, and i have to say the Disney version with Kiefer Sutherland is the best because it captures a serious and interesting story with funny and dynamic characters, but when i saw the trailer for this version, i felt as if the filmmakers wanted to just spoof the whole idea. Boy, was i wrong; this version was just as good as the Disney version, to me that is, only because it captures that same goofiness and adds more serious sword fights and action, while giving the story a steam-punk twist. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, but it is definitely worth buying on DVD as it's another fun swashbuckling tale that keeps you wanting more and has no reason to insult your intelligence as it was made to be a fun movie. Don't let the critics keep you from seeing this; just think a mixture of Pirates of the Caribbean & Sherlock Holmes with a dumbed-down script and you get The Three Musketeers 8/10 Stars***",The Three Musketeers

I've seen many musketeer movies through the years and this one wasn't the best one in my opinion but it was certainly not the worst either. It has a lot of adventure and cool scenes with good special effects.I did not expect to see Milla Jovovich in a movie like this but she really pulled it off. And it was pretty nice seeing Orlando Bloom playing a villain for a change, I've had the feeling that he always plays the a character with same qualities in almost every movie (Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Kingdom of Heaven etc).This movie is much more adventurous and wild than the '93 version and in my opinion these two can't really be compared because they are made for different audiences.

83,lekgolah,OTT nonsense but will entertain those in search of escapism,6,6 February 2012,"Sometimes you can determine if a film will be for you by looking at the director; for example Spielberg and Nolan because their films remaining consistent in what audiences expect from them. Martin Scorsese broke the mold with Hugo - a film made a much wider audience and that children can watch. Before I make comparisons with them to Paul W.S. Anderson, this does differ slightly from his usual mix of bloody violence and the usual dark atmosphere. The Three Musketeers is bright, breezy and entertaining - the later being something he has tended to miss in last few films. While it is certainly not perfect and no where near Pirates of the Caribbean, which it so clearly aims for, the film is fun to watch if underdeveloped. Characters are introduced quickly and the action soon follows. For a film advertised on its CGI-heavy action scenes, it is the sword fights between the Musketeers and the Cardinal's men that are the most enjoyable to watch. The fight choreography can be brutal if a little bloodless while the CGI airship battles lack a sense of danger. The four leads (Macfadyen, Evans, Stevenson and Lerman) make the most of a sub-par script and keep things moving. It is only when they are not on screen that the film begins to drag. While Waltz, Bloom and Mikkelsen are good villains, they are never given the dialogue that will allow them to reach their full potential. Regardless, at just over 90 minutes, there are worser films out there and this is one worth checking out if you are interested. Just don't expect to find yourself watching it again.",The Three Musketeers
84,TourettesPersonal,All For Fun,6,19 October 2011,"At first glance, we all know that this will never be a great version of The Three Musketeers but with all the flying ships and the swashbucklery, we can still give it a try. The film ends up pretty fun. Even with all the silly nonsense and the modern stuff scattered in the film. The cast made it enjoyable. The 3D is surprisingly good. But in the end, it's just another blockbuster. The film also had troubles to its pacing and the writing is a bit modern. The Three Musketeers won't end up as a classic but it can be fun in some times.The baffle goes to the director. Paul W.S. Anderson is an unusual person to direct a film like this since he's more of a futuristic action movie guy. Adding some steampunk and plenty of slow-mos. The film didn't end up being too faithful to the original story. The director just wants to feel comfortable to his style. Modernism, Cool Devices, Hot Women, and Slow-Mo. The pacing is problematic in the second act. It shows the plan of the villains and in parts, you won't notice that it already passes another day.The other thing about the second act, the Musketeers are mostly absent. It shows more of the antagonists and their plans. It's like Transformers where the titular characters only appear when there's danger and mostly focuses to a kid and the villains. But here, the titular characters are not bland.Some of the cast made their scenes enjoyable. Logan Lerman does his thing. Not quite appreciating though. But his female fans will love it. The actors who played the three musketeers gives plenty of personality to their roles. Matthew Macfadyen is pretty cool as Athos. We don't get to see much Luke Evans but he is cunning as Aramis. Ray Stevenson is as usual, funny and had much character. In the antagonists, Christophe Waltz has many style of being a villain. Orlando Bloom looks like he's enjoying but a little threat in his little scenes. Mads Mikkelsen is the only serious villain among them. Milla Jovovich does her swagger and seductiveness but a little personality.The action is pretty cool. But so much slow-mos. Just like in Resident Evil Afterlife. Slow-motion to make it cool. Anderson started these excessive slow-mos in Resident Evil 4. Maybe he thought these things will affect the 3D or maybe he just wanted to be cool. It's cool enough but when the musketeers was helping D'Artagnan to fight Rochefort's army, there is one moment of this scene that looks too similar to 300. When Athos was slashing them but here there are no blood. No matter how violent they kill, you won't see a single drop. The 3D is surprisingly good. It's almost like a gimmick but this gimmick is actually good. Swords, Bombs, Pointy Objects, and other stuff.The production design is decent. The costumes and the setting are well made. The CGI were obviously good. The flying battleships and some CGI swords. CGI bombs. CGI background. The music score fits the whole theme but every single score repeats in every scene. The writing isn't good. Too modern. They said the S word but it's funny anyways.Fans of the original story will definitely be disappointed with this adaptation but if you are in for some steampunk, slow-mos, swashbuckling swordfights then try watch this. It will not remain a classic or one of the best. It's not really trying to be the best. It's just a version with futuristic elements or it could be just a 3D gimmick. The movie wasn't bad as I expected but it has those flaws that aren't easy to ignore. It just wanted to be fun. It's good to watch as an action film. As an adaptation, it's good to watch right now but someday it'll be forgotten or ignored. But really, this is fun.",The Three Musketeers
85,dukevega,Greater In Scale Only,6,23 October 2011,"When I saw the trailer, two things caught my eye: airships and Orlando Bloom as a villain. And while these two elements were admirable, the rest were average at best, leaving an admittedly visually impressive movie that was left quite thin in the area of the characters. They were quite bland, except for Orlando as a foppish but rather mean-spirited Duke of Buckingham and an unknown (to me) as an equally foppish King of France. Even Christophe Waltz as the Cardinal left me rather bored (oh, the downside of playing such as impressive villain in Colonel Hans Landa).For my money, the 1993 version was much better; the characters were given room to really show off, and Tim Curry almost stole the show as the Cardinal.",The Three Musketeers

It's very watchable, well made, entertaining, nice CGI, I enjoyed it and for the first time in many movies did not fall asleep while watching.

90,AdrianOlonan,"Experience Dumas's ""The Three Musketeers"" Like Never Before in the 2011 3D Adaptation",10,17 December 2014,"There have been many adaptations of Alexander Dumas's ""The Three Musketeers"". Even Disney and Mattel have their adaptations. I'm actually surprised that they adapted this novel, as these companies are known to be selling their products to very young audiences. ""Musketeer"" comes from the word ""musket"", a type of gun. Simply put, a musketeer is skilled in using the musket. Judging the film's premise and entire run, this must be the best ""Three Musketeers"" adaptation yet.The plot has been changed from the novel, and now involves a conspiracy plot that will force France to go to war. That conspiracy plot serves as the major surprise. The Da Vinci's Vault is fascinating. The airships are spectacular. I like how Milady acts as a spy girl in the 1600s. The swordplay is exciting. As Paul WS Anderson, the director of ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"", is excellent in 3D, ""Three Musketeers"" intensify the viewing experience to new heights. The music is medieval, classic, and apt. I really appreciate Logan Lerman and Milla Jovovich the most for playing D'Artagnan and Milady respectively.The film's ending calls for a sequel, probably called ""The Four Musketeers"", now counting D'Artagnan. I agree with Jovovich for criticizing Summit in failing to promote this film. This adventure film deserves better than $132 million box office revenue. If the production companies Constantin Film and Davis Pictures plan a sequel, they should collaborate with Screen Gems (Sony) to distribute the film. Sony has Spiderman, James Bond, Resident Evil, and Underworld film franchises while Summit has only Twilight and Divergent film franchises.",The Three Musketeers
91,MC1-Bjornson,Stick with the Candybar,4,29 December 2011,"""The Three Musketeers"" (2011), Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Violence & Mild Gore. Running Time: 1hr&50mn. - One Star (out of Four) Hey there, Hollywood. Have I done something to offend you? Whatever it was, please come clean with me. We can talk about it. Heck, I'll even apologize. We used to be good pals once upon a time. What happened between us? That's pretty much what I was thinking as I watched the latest interpretation of ""The Three Musketeers."" I honestly felt like I was being punished for something, though I'm not quite sure of what. By the film's close, I was both relieved and appalled. Even now, I am still wondering: what happened with this movie? Hollywood took the concept of ""The Three Musketeers"" (which is a apparently more than just a candybar) about a trio of swashbuckling members of the 17th century French royal guard and over saturated it with unnecessarily loud crescendoing music; an exotic countess who doubles as a back-stabbing catburglar in a ""Mission: Impossible""-style heist, an onslaught of characters with goofy, inconsistent accents; and then they added some large-scale airship sky-battles that look like ""Master & Commander"" (2003) crossed with ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan"" (1982). I kid you not. Even as I write this, I'm as baffled now as I was when the end credits rolled. I'm still waiting for Ashton Kutcher to pop up with a video camera to tell me that I've just been punked.Perhaps it's not the filmmakers' fault on the quality of the movie we got from them. I'm thinking they made this kind of movie to cater to the fast-food movie masses that want their movies loaded with ""the works"". Like most special effects heavy actioneers released now, ""The Three Musketeers"" was made in 3-D. While the filmmakers were focusing on the quantity of characters, gimmicks and random events to put into this movie, they compromised on the quality.Ever since the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie, there has been a steady increase in films with music scores that go ""rum-dum-dum-dum."" Special emphasis on ""dumb""! Going the way of the dodo are scores rich in majesty that were melodic narratives to their films. I'm not saying this is how all movies should be scored. Though it would be nice if a movie's premise warrants a traditional score approach in lieu of ""rum-dum-dum-dum."" Instead, we get ""rum-dum-dum-dum"" all too frequently. You know what? It's wearing kind of thin.Hey, here's idea: How about making a movie that's not top heavy on superficiality and is actually fun to watch. Wouldn't that be something? One where I can get immersed in young D'Artagnan's (Logan Lerman) dream of becoming a Musketeer when he leaves his rural home for Paris. Imagine the kind of movie where I'm pleased to see the introduction of the Three Musketeers: Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Aramis (Luke Evans) and learn of their history and current plight. After all, they're the heroes of the story, right? When movies are done well, this kind of story has the potential to be fun. I think the filmmakers dropped the ball on the touchdown pass.If I had to applaud ""The Three Musketeers"" for anything, apart from the ending so I could leave, I'd go with look of the sets and the costuming. There's a lot of money squandered on the screen with so much meaninglessness going on, but at least the visuals are good. Now if only something interesting had happened in front of these grandiose backdrops, we'd be okay. If you have the kind of money to produce a film like this, wouldn't you want a return on your dollar? The best way to do that is to have a good script, a good director, a good cast and a good goal of what your movie is about. Random chaos thrown together a good film does not make.It's obvious director Paul W.S. Anderson played fast and loose with the original premise of ""The Three Musketeers,"" a classic Alexandre Dumas novel written in 1844. Granted, fast and loose interpretations of printed works often sell movie tickets. Faithfulness to the original text is optional. It's perfectly legitimate to take your film in another direction. Take the novel and the film version of ""Jaws"" (1975): they're very different versions of the basic story. Both are effective and are revered as classics in their respective mediums.With ""The Three Musketeers"" you get a film which irritates and frustrates you while you're hoping the movie will turn into more than what you get. Then nothing of consequence happens. You get a film that's all about the polish without the shine. If you have the attention span of a flea, you should probably do just fine with this feature. But come on, you can do better than settle for this. If we accept this movie and turn it into a money maker for the studio which put it out, they'll give us more of the same. This kind of tolerance has already been gone on for too long as is.Okay Hollywood, now it is YOUR turn to apologize.",The Three Musketeers
92,dario_malic,"All for fun, no fun for anyone",3,31 July 2012,"""Les Trois Mousquetaires"" by Alexandre Dumas is probably one of the most frequently adapted novels and inspiration for numerous movies throughout the last hundred years. With so many adaptations, one gets suspicious when there's another one in the works. It must show something new, take an original approach to the story, and be great at it, to justify another adaptation. And so came The Three Musketeers"" from director Paul W. S. Anderson, known mostly for his Resident Evil movies. The approach he chose is an action-comedic one. Action, humor and CGI, those seem to be Anderson's musketeers. As the fourth one we can put in Milla Jovovich's (Anderson's wife) décolleté. But the musketeers disappoint.Watching this movie I thought of Guy Ritchie's recent Sherlock Holmes adaptations. They are very similar in their intention, with Musketeers a little bit more of a parody, but are worlds apart in their execution. While Holmes movies manage to be an intelligent fun, Musketeers fall short. What should be humorous turns out not so funny, mostly because of the script which sees characters in already seen situations and gives them bad lines. Most of the characters turn out to be caricatures and it rarely hits the mark (Bloom's Duke of Buckingham). The action relies heavily on CGI and fails because of it. CGI is as bad as I've ever seen, making scenes look like they're taken from a poorly done video game, and completely unnecessary slow-motion sequences don't help.You noticed I didn't say anything about the plot, and I won't say much. That's because there's no need to. Once again Cardinal Richelieu plots to overthrow the king, this time with help from Milady de Winter and inevitable Rochefort. There's also Duke of Buckingham who gets double-crossed and seeks revenge. Of course, the musketeers are here to save the day. Oh, and there's the dumbest ending ever (for a movie which doesn't have a sequel already in the works).As I already said, the idea isn't that bad, but it's ruined by shallow script and bad direction. With those things as bad as they are things that usually impress in a period piece, like costume design or music, just don't catch your attention. Although, you can't say the movie looks bad (minus the CGI). One thing that's positive about the movie is the acting. While most of the actors do an average job, we can highlight performances by Mads Mikkelsen who makes Rochefort a parody of his Le Chiffre character from Casino Royale"", and Orlando Bloom who clearly enjoys his over the top Duke of Buckingham. It's a shame they aren't in a better movie.I never wanted to watch the new musketeers movie in the first place, but we were at a friend's house and he likes his movies new and filled with visual effects, so we took a chance. As it is, we would've been better off watching Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" again. In the end, it seems better to let the musketeers rest, at least until someone with a great idea and the ability to pull it off in style comes along.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",The Three Musketeers
93,WilderMovieReviews,Flying ships!,6,19 March 2012,"This is an updated version of the classic story written by Alexandre Dumas père. There have been many film adaptations of the story and this is the latest.The film follows D'Artagnan as he tries to join the legendary Musketeers. He meets up with the famous three Musketeers and assists them in preventing war between France and England.This film tries a few new things with the story and introduces flying ships! By flying ships I mean they get a ship and attach an airship to it and you now have flying ships. The other change they give us is less action and less sword fights. I couldn't help compare the two other modern adaptations of this story, The Three Musketeers (1993) and The Musketeer (2001). I really hoped that the makers of this would combine the great elements of these films, the great cast and the fun and adventure of the 1993 version and the spectacular fight scenes of the 2001 version to produce something great. But it doesn't. It often comes close with the action with the use of slow motion but that is it. For the most part the characters are forgetful, the fight scenes are standard and the script is basic. If you look at the 1993 version made by Disney, you have a great cast, a great script, awesome villain and fun, exciting action scenes. This missed a great opportunity to do something amazing with a classic story, using modern film making. The use of the flying ships could have been so good but it was underutilized.However all is not lost, the film has Orlando Bloom as the Duke of Buckingham. He steals every scene he is in as the cocky and arrogant Duke. You look forward to his scenes and wish he could have played a more prominent role in the film. He is by far the best character in the film. It almost seems that he knew that this film needed some fun injected into it and made it his mission to steal every moment he was on screen.I really love the 1993 version of the film and maybe this is why I was disappointed with this one. I guess I expected too much. If you haven't seen the 1993 film please watch this updated one, you should enjoy it. Then watch the 1993 version and see what this one could have been.",The Three Musketeers
94,omega_work,A muddled mishmash ripoff of other films,1,10 March 2012,"When the film opens the music is very similar to The Dark Knight. There is a brief Lord of the Rings-esc prologue except they used model toys to show the battle scene followed by a brief scene to introduce the players (which had a bit of a Guy Ritchie feel to it).Next we meet D'Artagnan, who is practising sword fighting, which is pretty much how he's introduced in every other version of the story. He heads off to become a musketeer, and along the way gets annoyed at a guy for insulting his horse (I'm sure I've seen this exact same exchange in another movie I just can't put my finger on it). Anyway, because of this D'Artagnan determines he must kill him. Sounding stupid and cliché yet? Don't worry, it gets worse.Once D'Artagnan teams up with the three musketeers, we meet Planchet, who is clearly inserted here (much differently than in the novel) to be a bumbling comic relief. Unfortunately his ""jokes"" aren't actually funny. A running ""joke"" is that each of the musketeers takes a turn telling him to ""shut up"". It might have been somewhat humorous if the punchline included a bady telling him to shut up rather than the last line of the film being the three of them telling him to shut up in unison.A large part of the plot is centered around a flying machine that was based on Da Vinci's famous drawing -- which for some reason in this film was locked in a vault. I'm not even going to get into the ludicrousness of hiding away plans for something that would put your country years ahead of the rest of the world for 200 years. Anyway, when a predictable double-cross occurs the plans fall into the hands of England (France's enemy), that spins into a plot involving the Cardinal trying to make King Louie think his wife is having an affair.The final half of the movie goes from ridiculous to preposterous. One of the golden rules of storytelling is to avoid lucky coincidences (at least after act 1), and make the hero have to fight through things on his own, yet this is filed with happy coincidences that mount to a point of ridiculousness. In the end D'Artagnan gets to square off with the guy who so malevolently insulted his horse.A lot of the action sequences have cinematography stolen from the likes of the Matrix and 300. But with a filmmaker like Paul W.S. Anderson at the helm could anything actually creative be expected?Honestly, I think Alexandre Dumas is rolling in his grave if he's had the misfortune of watching this.",The Three Musketeers
95,aliholly-62819,Swashbuckling fun,7,21 January 2021,"Remember when IMDB was for serious people? I miss those days. Now all we get are 1 and 10 star reviews. No flavor. All these ratings are for avid lovers of the book that can't realize a different take on a classic story. I empathize, truly. There are instances where I can't set aside my bias and I truly hate a movie because it's not faithful to my beloved book. Be that the case, I won't review the film.
Anyway...
So no, I haven't read The Three Musketeers, as much as I love the classics. I put this on because I was looking for a fun action film and that's what I got. One: It was visually stunning! That's really what drew me in. The costumes were flamboyant and the sets were incredible. The characters are only ok, they do lack some depth. However, this is a film in the spirit of Pirates of the Caribbean, as in its swashbuckling fun. With the exception of a few foul words, it's a relatively clean action film I can enjoy with my kids. (It's even cleaner than the Disney version).

The point of remake is to use the new technology in Film Making to produce the same story with a new look. And I see that this is what happened in this movie. This version contains a new incidents but in the same story line. I mean if you read the actual story which all ""The Three Musketeers"" movies are based on, you will find it as: ""Three brave professional musketeers who dedicated their skills for France, they meet a new apprentice who dreams to be one of them. They take care of him and he goes in troubles with them when they discover a conspiracy against the king."" This is the general story, all the movies are based on this but in different scenarios. So, I see no fault in this one, it is really amazing and deserves 9/10 And from the end of the movie, I think there will be (and for the first time) another part of the three musketeers. Anyway, I strongly recommend this one if you want a good action and adventure movie.",The Three Musketeers
97,yarik83,A proper guide to defile an ageless story.,4,9 May 2012,"I have watched probably 6 or 7 different adaptations of 3 musketeers in several different languages. I also grew up reading the book by Dumas and I actually shed a tear as I forced myself to watch 2 hours of this stuff. 2011 adaptation is a despicable but mildly funny remake of the original adaptation. It is an abomination, a hanna montana and icarly omage gone wrong and a definite spit in the face to anyone who have enjoyed the book or previous adaptations. I honestly do not know where to even begin with this movie. What happens when you cross solid actors and a solid story and attempt to convert them to year 2012? A vial, deplorable concucsion is born from tears of everyone around the world weeping bloody tears from their eyes as they watched this. How could they have screwed up this bad? The story has been told many times and each adaptation so far has always been true to the book more or less. This movie, however takes on a different journey that let to nowhere. For starters it looks like produces dumped millions of dollars into CGI. Why? When and why did someone decide that it was not good enough to use good old wooden ships and actual locations or movie props to film a movie that takes place a few centuries ago? When and why did they decide that a cross breed between adolescent humor junk being shown on cartoon network and Disney channels could mix with what could be considered a masterpiece? How could they do that to Dumas? As I am writing this my blood is boiling and I just do not get why someone would defile a book in such a way. So to get things started let's talk about the movie. It starts off with our beloved musketeers getting into all kinds of trouble. Something about scuba diving (ehh say what?) a ninja, a funky folding cross bow and a dame played by Mila. Mila is known for her skinny buddy so I do not know what they had to do to get her A-cup bust appear so voluptuous throughout the movie. Skip ahead to D'Artanian and we have found him to be a boy. Since when he was a boy? Outside of all that he manages to get into trouble, a scuffle happens and next thing you know our musketeers are embarking on a journey from perhaps the cheesiest romance request in recent cinema history. Some airships follow as well as a good old honest to goodness aircraft fight which eventually leads us to the conclusion of the movie where nothing really made sense. In all honesty the only thing good about the movie were young king and his wife, both of whom played minor roles but memorable ones. All other actors could have made this movie into a musketeer version of pirates of the Caribbean. Instead we got a older version of Justin Bieber playing main cast. Something he is not particularly good ad but you do not tend to notice his performance because all through the movie you notice dry humor, very cheesy story line, completely disassociated from the book adventures for all 2 hours of the movie. I think where it all went wrong was when someone signed on a dotted line and accepted the script. A script that called for a complete redesign of the story line, perhaps to cater to younger crowd?! At the very least they could have stuck to the time period without dragging bits and pieces from various time lines into one script. Da'Vinchi for example had really nothing to do with the book and yet his creations were featured in the opening. Airships had absolutely no relevance in the story line and yet they were THE main attraction in the movie getting much of the screen time. On top of that good old fashioned sword fights barely had time to sink in and we were practically consumed by gun fight, explosions, more explosions, some ninja weaponry, some more ninja weaponry and the list goes on. I wish people stopped making movies for sake of just making movies. When you deviate from the story you need to have a tale so solid that even die hard fanatics could associate with. Just think of some of the interesting medieval and renaissance adaptations as of late. A knight's Tale comes to mind. In the end I hope that bitter taste of this movie fades from my mind as I sleep off the sorrow overnight. I hope that when I wake up tomorrow this movie will be in its red Netflix envelope and heading back to the vault where it belongs locked up under lock and key.",The Three Musketeers
98,khfan250,What you see is what you get...,5,6 November 2011,"If you saw the trailer to this movie and thought to yourself, ""Gee, that looks good or, at least, entertaining."" then you'll probably like this movie. But, if you watched the trailer and said, ""Wow, that looks incredibly stupid."" then you will hate this movie. I wanted to be entertained, so I paid $7.50 to be entertained. Was I? Yes. Does that make it a good film? ...Not really. The story and script completely forgets that it's based on the classic Alexandre Dumas tale and seems more like a rip-off of the last steampunk-influenced movie, Sherlock Holmes. The plot is all over the place and lost my attention within the first ten minutes.The acting is more of a hit and miss. Matthew Macfadyen, Ray Stevenson, and Luke Evans as the titular characters do well in their respective roles. Each brought their own respective characters to life. Logan Lerman, being one of the worst child actors the world has ever known, is disastrous. His only job in this movie is to complain, smirk at the camera, and make feeble attempts to make the audience laugh. The three villains, on the other hand, were hilarious!...in a bad way. I like Orlando Bloom, but honestly, what was he doing in this movie? It seemed like he was trying too hard to be slimy and nefarious, and just came out to be over-the-top and goofy. Milla Jovovich's only job is to be sexy to such an irritating point where you stop caring. And, is it just me, or does Christoph Waltz sound like Tommy Wiseau in this movie? The other supporting characters do well, particularly James Corden as Planchet, who steals every scene he's in. The sword fights are well choreographed. I haven't seen such impressive swordsmanship in a film since The Lord of the Rings. But on the other hand, the cinematography and CGI is absolutely LAZY. I mean, it's bad. REALLY bad. It's half-hearted, cheap, but, then again, what did you expect from Paul W.S. Anderson, the genius behind the Mortal Kombat movie?! Final verdict: If you are a fan of the Alexander Dumas story or you're looking for a spectacular movie, you'll want to avoid this movie. However, if you can ignore its flaws and enjoy it as a popcorn flick, you'll like it enough at a matinée price. I found it to be fun, despite its several flaws.",The Three Musketeers

Super-star cast. It could have been okay.But Logan Lerman as D'Artagnan? Please. The second I realized the role he was playing, I knew I was in for a clock-watching ordeal. It really boggles the mind. It would be like casting Jim Parsons as John Rambo. I am not sure he had even hit puberty as of the making of this trash.Like others have noted, this was similar to Pirates of the Caribbean. And not because Bloom was in it. So it could have been okay, but waiting for a zit to maybe appear on D'Artagnan's face ruined it for me.",The Three Musketeers
101,MidoriFiore,Bland,5,15 October 2011,"So despite having one of the worst trailers this year, topped only by the Breaking Dawn trailer I watched The Three Musketeers. It was must better than i thought it would be, yet that douse not say much. Constantin Films, a German company, are the people behind it. It's funded with German tax-money, much like how our Swedish tax-money are spent to finance crap by Lars Von Trier. At least Germans got jobs out of this film, but I believe that the money should be spent on a sequel to Wir Sind Die Nacht by Dennis Ganel rather than this.Logan Lerman is bland and so Luke Evans and Matthew Macfadyen. Not much of an impression. I liked Christoph Waltz and Ray Stevenson who did a very good job with the material. Milla Jovovich walks around acting all sexy. It seems Paul W.S. Anderson is screaming: LOOK HOW HOT MY WIFE IS!!! At least Tim Burton tries to give Helena Bonham Carter something to work with. Gabriella Wilde and Orlando Bloom are terrible. I have never seen worse acting from Orlando Bloom ever in a film. Razzie Award here you come! Mads Mikkelsen has nothing to do for most of the film and it seems they tried as hard as they could to make him appear like One-Eye in Valhalla Rising so he would seem more dangerous. It did not work.Oh, I almost forgot! Seemingly one the German producers insistence Til Schweiger is in this too. For a whole minute! The action scenes where alright. Nothing special. The plot was ordinary. Nothing special. Faithful to the book? Sort of... I have seen worse, but I have also seen better.The opening prologue could been cut. It would actually have made the movie deeper and the characters more interesting. Actuall character development. What about that?",The Three Musketeers

103,ttaskmaster,Tired re-re-rehashing of past films.,3,19 January 2012,"The Three Musketeers... a perennial favourite like Robin Hood, it seems. Do we really NEED this many movies about the same origin story of how D'Artagnan joins the Muskies?No matter how many things you try and add, the basic story is still the same and it's down to whoever's interpretation people prefer. I have to say that the plot of The Man In The Iron Mask was at least unique. This is just yet another tired old retelling of the same old basic tale, but without even full character development. Someone in Hollywood had some money to spend. That was the whole driver for this project. The acting was fine, but never really notable. These are all good actors, we know, but they seemed like they had almost nothing to work with and simply could not escape their contract. Macfadyen was especially dull - I could accept that as his normal character behaviour, but he was like that in every single scene. Is Athos really that dead inside that the most heartwrenching sorrows and gutwrenching action cannot even stir as much as a raised eyebrow?I'm as much a fan as anyone of movies where you *can* switch your mind off if you so choose, but this is one where you have to - 3-D bandwaggons and flying ships galore, supported by silly gimmick jokes, notable actors (who I guess only did the film for some pocket money), great set pieces, mediocre props and the usual tired old themes and dialogue all make for one spectacularly anti-climactic film. Take all those cool elements of previous Musketeer films, combine them and add some bits seen in other films - The end product is this 2011 version. Nothing special, nothing new and nothing more of note than Orlando Bloom's rockabilly haircut. To use a cooking analogy - The film follows an obvious and well-used recipe, yet fails to supply the right ingredients in the right measures, bakes at the wrong temperature for the wrong time, fails to rise and then burns to a crisp, before the chef gives up completely and gets a take-out from Billy's Bad Burger Joint down the local back alley instead...",The Three Musketeers
104,rraa-dd,A very enjoyable action-adventure movie,10,11 February 2012,"I enjoyed watching The Three Musketeers. A lot. I was not expecting anything that would leave me praising it for years like Avatar or King Kong did, but the movie was very pleasing to watch. There is action, humour, surprises, a fairly interesting plot, friendship, romance and other values that are important in life. Some of the scenes may be unrealistic, but of course nobody can expect a movie like this to portray realistic events. This is an enjoyable adventure with some edge-of-the-seat action. One of the top reviews on here states that the dialogue and characters are poor. Utter nonsense. There is nothing wrong with either. Character development is nice and smooth and makes you engage with the characters. Sound and graphic effects are brilliant.Overall this was very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone wishing to watch a nice action-adventure flick.",The Three Musketeers
105,fatsamuraireviews,"Not for one, not for all.",2,3 December 2011,"Take a story that has been done a few times, and add in a new mix of pre steam punk and you have the new Three Musketeers movie. The mix of archaic futuristic technology (I think I made up a term there) and the very stylized fight scenes make this the visual extravaganza that you expect. I was mildly entertained by the CGI shininess but overall this movie left me with a Wild Wild West feeling and that's not a complement.I wonder what Mr. Dumas would have thought about the result of his work. Could he sue for defamation of character? As much as this story has been redone, just being the eye candy explosion is not enough to make this story worth wile. Other people have done much better with this same story.

They could have just titled it, The Un-Three Musketeers, or The Three Musketeers take a break, the charm of the book and the older movies is that each character had a unique personnality, this movie completely ignores this and just goes on with blowing stuff up. Without writing any ""spoilers"", the movie barely touches on anything Dumas wrote, this is not an interpretation of the amazing Dumas novel, its a complete turd designed to wow a younger audience. Why did they need Mila Jovovich in a central role as ""James Bondess"", not even closely resembling Milady, other than a corsett? I will tell you why, she's married to the director, so why not, stick your wife into this turd of a movie. Ooo heres a spoiler for you, there are no zombies in the movie, which kind of surprised me, they threw everything else in. Its a sad shame that an entire generation who have never read the book have to see this waste of time.

Good action sequences which though they should make me feel ""I can't believe they did this"", makes me feel good and smile with satisfaction.The protagonists are simply awesome for their parts. Well done to them and the director. Editing is perfectly done too. Music, the same. Script, as long as you don't mind about the freedoms in realism, it's fun and enjoyable.The best part for me is, in contrary to other similar movies (action films with a touch of comedy and tons of ridiculous action sequences) I didn't find it boring at any point.

So many millions squandered, so many work hours, only to result in something that looks so haphazard. Mediocre visual effects and visually pleasing settings (alas historically inaccurate) can not redeem the abysmal writing of the dialogues, the terribly developed and frankly annoying characters and the overall school- play quality of acting.

110,ryokan_wc,"Not that bad, not that extraordinary either",7,2 November 2011,"Before i dive into my review of the movie, allow me to bring you, in a gist, through the summary of the story.The first thing that comes to mind of 'The Three Musketeers' is the three musketeers- Athos, Porthos and Aramis. We know them for their threesome companionship. We know about their glory days, serving their country. In their last quest, Athos gets blindsided by the love of his life, and the three musketeers sort of lost interest, hope and faith in themselves. Then comes d'Artagnan, a child of another musketeer, who meets the three musketeers in a very scheduled manner, boost their long lost spirit of a musketeer and the three becomes four. A quest to save the French from going into war in the Europe is thrown to them. Romance ensues. Trust is put to the question. Bam, bam, bam, the movie ends oh- so well.Now to the review. Firstly, watching through this movie, i felt it was very much like a crossover between Pirates of the Caribbean and Zorro. The settings. The ships. The acting. No doubt, this movie boasts great cast (Matthew M as Athos, Luke Evans as Aramis, Ray S as Porthos, Milla J as Milady, Orlando B as Duke of Buckingham, Logan L as d'Artagnan). Orlando's role as the Duke felt like Captain Jack Sparrow in POTC, only less drunk. It's nice to see Milla out from her high-octane roles; nevertheless her character performs dangerous moves as a many-faced villain. The three musketeers are definitely fun to watch.Next, the fencing scenes are exciting, especially when d'Artagnan meets the three musketeers and the four of them are forced to fight against the guards because of his reckless action. The storyline is rather predictable. The climax is short and leaves not much impact. The good part is, to me, when they plan for their quest. Then, it just fall flat. No twist except for the moment before the credit is rolled.The Three Musketeer is not that bad, and not that extraordinary either. But it does make me want to be in that era- to be a musketeer, with their fancy swords, too. It is comical, which is a good reason why you might want to watch this. Or if you are a fan of the three musketeers. Truthfully, i did not know what the three musketeers are other than the fact that there are three of them. It is a good introduction. Otherwise, you might want to give this a pass.",The Three Musketeers

This one easily takes the cake to be the worst of them all.I am not a fan of Dumas either, but his original story is far more appealing than the one here. What disturbs me most is the modern element that the script writer tried to sneak in. The ""Assassin's Creed"" style killing and the cult around Da Vinci were amazing when I played Assassin's Creed several years ago, but here they were just plain annoying and making the whole French thing to Italian renaissance. The three musketeers are more machine gun operators than sword fighters. The bullet time is great but still inferior to 300 in many aspects.Perhaps it is time to dust off the 1993 version and enjoy that.",The Three Musketeers
112,otterman62,could have been so much better,6,16 April 2014,"I've just watched this on TV and wanted to make a specific point that in my opinion this film was ruined by the casting. The 3 musketeers has been redone so many times that I thought that the updating of technology was a new twist and that it was OK, in what was clearly meant to be a ""boys own"" adventure. the main story was far fetched but entertaining. What spoilt the finished article was that d'artagnan , and porthos had no charm whatsoever, aramis was completely anonymous, milady wasn't sexy enough to be the supposed seductress, the queen looked about 12 and again had no sex appeal, Richelieu and his main henchman were not menacing enough and Buckingham was reduced to a pantomime villain, although this was more the script than blooms performance.......I cant think of many films with so many main characters so miscast. the only ones who came out of it with some credit were athos (matthew macfadyen) and constance (gorgeous gabrielle wilde)and planchet (james corden)a great pity as it could have been much much better.",The Three Musketeers
113,bousozoku,Enjoyable for all the wrong reasons,6,14 March 2012,"Poor Mr. Dumas would probably laugh about this. Someone has taken a bit of literary freedom with his story. It reminds me of Die Schatzinsel, a revised look at Stevenson's Treasure Island.We have the young man some older, wiser, and very cynical men and at least, one woman trying to tie up all the loose ends of the story.The plot centers around trying to take over the kingdom of France. If that's a spoiler, I guess the book is a spoiler. Perhaps, because of this movie, someone will open the book and read the original story written by Dumas.The fight scenes are quite good and entertaining, though the fast-slow-fast-slow is annoying. The personal scenes lack chemistry. e.g., as D'Artanyan finishes his sword practice with his father. His father reaches to place his had upon the heart, but D'Artanyan takes a step back. Perhaps, he fears his father? It seemed unfortunate.In fact, the quiet moments are where the movie falters and it is unfortunate since the action scenes are so good.I can say that I like the film and that, seeing the 3D version, it was not 3D for the sake of 3D, save one element.I believe that most people will be bored after the initial big fight sequence until the very end where the action is resumed.",The Three Musketeers

I mean really, I'm up for fun like the next punter, but this is CG gone crazy and completely devoid of any semblance of entertainment. It looks wonderful, but that's it.

Anyway, it isn't hard to understand why this $75,000,000 piece of garbage flopped in the box office. This shows that the public is not as stupid as we may think.

124,couchfrenchfry,Excellent Update of a Classic,10,18 June 2014,"I heartily approve of the trend of taking classic tales and adding modern techniques to liven up the action. The Three Musketeers is an action packed thriller. I mean the original story. I'm certain the author would approve this version because action and adventure is what the musketeers are all about. The additions are not even that far out. It was 1783 when the Montgolfier brothers first flew in a hot air balloon. The Da Vinci flying war ship is simply a step up from that. Why should classics be put on a special shelf labeled, 'Do not touch?' A good tale does not suffer from the addition of modern techniques. Please enjoy this film for what it is, a fun, action packed romp.",The Three Musketeers
125,MyrPraune,Alexandre Dumas is rolling in his grave for sure,4,29 June 2012,"I never want to watch movies involving a novel that I really liked, especially historical novels. And especially when we're talking about the Three Musketeers. No movie can render properly the wit and charm of Dumas' prose (as well as Auguste Maquet, his main ghost writer). There is no way to convey through image what's described with such subtlety in writing. But if it were just that, it would not be bad. My main problem is, every time Hollywood wants to paw Dumas' classic, it can't just leave the characters or the story the way the author created them. That's got to be the most annoying thing in the world. In this version,I have to say I have been pleasantly pleased with a lot of the first part of the movie. Athos is quite close to his literary self, which in itself is a feat, since he is regularly the most disfigured character of them all (see Man In The Iron Mask for a good example of what not to do). Here, he's not that far from Dumas' character, and I must say that Matthew Macfadyen gives him a gravity and a melancholy that suits the part perfectly. The way D'Artagnan is introduced to the Three Musketeers follows the novel practically word for word, which made me really happy. Porthos is nowhere as colourful as the one in the novel,but at least he's not made to be this big dumb ridiculous caricature,which is already an improvement on Man In The Iron Mask, to name it again. Aramis is more a figurative role in this movie, and I guess it's better than completely change him. But the movie begins and ends with stupidities and unforgivable liberties that have been taken with Dumas' chef d'oeuvre, for the only apparent reason that today's audience will go to see your movie only if there's an insane amount of frantic pointless action, no matter how ridiculous it is or far removed to the original story. The Three Musketeers have never been in cahoots with Milady to steal stuff, she is from Athos' secret past and only as the novel progresses do you understand all the details of her connexions with him. Not in this movie - she becomes this ridiculous martial-arts-before-its-time-specialist, with bustle skirts. Then,Buckingham is this dastardly villain in a ... flying ship??!??!?!?!!!! The character is completely wrong, and the idea of the flying ship is absolutely laughable. We haven't even talked about the dialogue yet. There is NOT ONE LINE of the movie that is truly memorable. D'Artagnan is immensely clever and fast-thinking in the novels; in this movie, he's just a teenager with a big head and nothing intelligent to say. And of course, Milady does not die, so we can be afflicted in due time with a sequel that will have absolutely nothing to do with ""Vingt Ans Après"", or anything resembling Alexandre Dumas' chef d'oeuvre. I still gave 4 out of 10 because of the good points of the beginning of the movie. If you have never read the real book Les Trois Mousquetaires, and if you're not too demanding on intelligent dialogue and well-constructed stories, you might be able to stand it. I saw it because my husband wanted to - I myself knew too much that I would be ticked off after seeing it. Anyway, I will still sleep tonight and the world will not stop turning because of one more bad movie ;-)",The Three Musketeers

127,jonclynch,Oh dear...,2,6 February 2021,"I can only assume that when they were given the book, the makers of this film smoked it along with mind-altering drugs. And that they made it their mission to find the least-suitable actors for each role and told them it was a pantomime. What it lacked in credibility it overcompensated with special effects that were so over the top as to be laughable. To be fair, there were a couple of funny scenes, but the script was surely cobbled together by drunken chimpanzees. They squeezed some expletives in to make it seem 'post ironic' or something. This failed. To cap it all, if you have to shoehorn James Corden into a film for 'comedy effect' then you've already set the bar pretty low. The most positive thing I can say about this excresence is that it is to everyone's immense relief that a sequel has never materialised.

Except for the actually really cool looking fights I didn't get anything, the cast is great but the dialogs and script are so horrible even Christoph Waltz couldn't save them. The story is all over the place, you don't get to know any of the musketeers, or barely a character at all and the biggest problem: A movie doesn't have to be realistic for me but it has to make sense in his own universe of the movie (like Matrix its not realistic but logical). The three musketeers plays with the rules of physics, logic and sense of a human being like they were beanbags. Oh and surprise surprise: 3D is useless, but thats nothing new tell me a movie that really had to have 3D except for avatar or maybe tron.Movie with a simple plot fine , one that makes no sense at all, you better don't count on my vote.So if you can enjoy a pointless excuse of a story for some nice swordplay, have fun.",The Three Musketeers

You know, how to see how the hell Logan Lerman and Mila Jovovich play out in this film! my friends said it was just outstanding and that is was the best movie of their lives. I sat back, relaxed and I found it hard to enjoy. THE THREE MUSKETEERS involves many hardly understandable stories mixed up into one movie: The pearls from the king, what the hell does that have to involve in a war between two powerful countries? That wasn't THAT awful, but the end is what made this film so ridiculous. I mean, so much effort, so much of fights and there's a stupid duel between Rochefort and D'Artagnan and D'Artagnan kills him, that's it!

Milla Jovovich and Christopher Waltz outshine the rest of the cast, with Logan Lerman earning a lackluster ""boo"" for his performance. (One cannot determine if his acting, his lines or his hair is the worst thing in the movie. Indeed, his hair cannot decide if it is a mullet or a throwback to ""That Shaggy Dog"".) The stunts are over the top, true, but great fun to watch, and the 3D effects don't disappoint. Unlike some other films the 3D continues throughout the movie - well worth wearing the silly glasses. Milla Jovovich continues to be one of the few female actors athletic enough to take on such an over the top physical role. The fight scenes are all well choreographed.Considering the near absence of promotion, this effort was a surprising and refreshing break from an otherwise joyless year.

While this movie is enjoyable, it doesn't raise above the level of ye average no-brainer action flick.

Nothing except the ridiculous use of cgi to create an impossible act of physics. Flying English warships, bullshit. I found this part of the movie unnecessary.Having got that out of the way I love Mila Jovovitch since The Fifth Element. Her hatred of the English in The Messenger Joan of Arc makes her ideal for the part. Roy Kinnear died making one of these Musketeer movies, he was a gem. I think he would like this movie it has all the stuff they did in the 70s with the likes of Oliver Reed, Faye Dunaway and Charlton Heston. I loved those films and this one is also lots of fun. Check out the originals before or after seeing this. They are truly classics.All said, a great performance by all, just a bit annoyed by the overstatement of English Naval power for that time. Airships? We hardly had a Navy during this period. We would soon be entangled in civil war, plague and fire all involving the French before being whipped by the Dutch. This is Pure French propaganda translated to English, but surprisingly embraced by the English soon after its publication.In homage this is definitely Hollywood doing its version, in that they overdid it with their flying rubbish that would never get off the ground. The ship has an enormous wooden double steering wheel. Airships need to be light. But It is definitely worth the watch if you consider it your average violent kids film with comic values. I Think Hollywood confused this classic with The Pirates of the Caribbean and could not resist adding their ""magic"" puke!The tradition continues, only slightly perverted by Hollywood.",The Three Musketeers
136,imhy,Watchable but just,3,5 February 2012,"Firstly I am amazed at how much of this movie was shot in front of a green screen. There's just SOOOO much CGI in this and it's not even good CGI.The storyline is bad and the dialog is horrible. There's no depth in the characters or the plot and the acting is just bad. I can't work out if this movie is suppose to be a thriller, drama or a comedy but I'm swaying to a really poor comedy.The action, stunts and fighting in this is so unrealistic and unbelievable. Milady runs through a tunnel with shooting spike balls and all she does is run and slide on her knees and gets past everything. Later she goes through some room that has fishing line all through it which apparently is razor sharp. How does she get through it? Simple. She just does a dive jump and misses all of it which of courseeeeeee would happen. The fighting between the musketeers and guards are slow and badly rehearsed. It was like they did all the scenes in slow motion in case they accidentally hit each other than sped it up to try and make it look normal.This movie is like a very bad and cheap version of Pirates of the Caribbean except there's no way a sequel will be made.",The Three Musketeers

The action was good and the musketeers were all handsome but if it had had a better storyline, it could have been much better. Orlando Bloom's part was awful and could put a lot of people right off him. There was not enough of the incredibly handsome and talented, Luke Evans and Ray Stevenson didn't really have much of a part either. The plot was ridiculous with the airships and took on an almost farcical element. Logan Lerman saved the day as the young feisty d'Artagnan and Mads Mikkelsen was his usual brilliant self.

This is a sort of teen musketeer version, with D'Artagnan looking 15, in love with a false blonde. Then, airships. Nothing could look less XVII Century than this foolishness. A waste of a few good actors like Christoph Waltz, Til Schweiger and Milla Jovovich. Even if you like the approach, the big problem with the movie is that there is no tension.

Luke Evans drifted in and out of being convincing. Some of the choreographed action scenes were executed poorly. If it wasn't for Jovovich, I would have dropped this to a 4.

A star like Milla Jovovich (as Milady de-Winter) sending up her Alice character from Resident Evil, was pure class. I never thought Alexander Dumas' story would transfer over to A Wachowski Brothers style action / adventure, but it did! With Pirates of the Caribbean styled music drifting in and out of the soundtrack, just added to the yarn. If you're a literary aficionado, then stay away from this film, as it will only wind you up.

See the name of the director and gladly stay away or have complaints that aren't based on logic. ""What would those wires trigger,an electronic alarm?"" Eeh...no,bells probably... ""How come Aramis can make a leap from that height without even twisting his ankle?"" God damn it,wh...Well,the musketeers are so legendary and mythological,maybe it was time to have fun with and present these guys as something close to superheroes,which the source material in a way view them as,larger-then-life...fitting words for this updated,laid-back version.""Sophisticated"" people,often say;You should read a book now and again instead of just watching simple movies."" In this case,I have to reply""Take the time to see a movie and view it as a movie instead of just reading books."" Everything evolves(not always for better of course),that's everything and just cause something's classic doesn't mean that it's gold. Dumas's stories about his musketeers isn't Shakespeare,no metaphor for the afterlife,it's adventure with a splash of thriller plot-wise.Who wants to see the same film over and over with the only difference being the actors? Not me. Adapt or die... Most of the story is intact. Milady is still a double-agent,the musketeers still have their virtues and flaws.Dartagnan will still run into a few men during a chase and challenge them all to duels and all will show up at the same location and time and...it's silly. I said it. And that's from the book.It's not a film that stands still,there's chasing,slicing and goofing and we get crisp cinematography for once by Anderson,good camera-work and everything about the surface is beautiful....I DO feel like a lot of hate just comes based on Andersons resume;If you""know""movies,you shouldn't like this,hence judging and sentencing it from a biased view.The cast is mostly able and sufficient for this kind of easygoing entertainment. Walz doesn't reek of menace and evil,I hear as complaint...but what kind of Cardinal would that make? As he says""Evil is just a point of view"" and lends a sophisticated,calm malice to Richelieu,who if we're honest looked a bit like a daft pedophile in Tim Currys flesh. Stevenson IS Porthos,Evans compensate lack of good material with charisma as Aramis and McFayden is funny as Arthos.Lehrman is certainly the weak link. Don't know his age but he looks 17 tops and him challenging menacing villains and big heroes...doesn't really work and you almost laugh. An androgyn actor.Jovovich,the directors wife,looks alright for 48:) but has way too much screen time and way too little range as an actress. Anderson should learn to separate career from personal life,at times it's almost""De Winters adventure"".Bloom in the ""controversial"" role as the cunning and arrogant Buckingham gives a flamboyant performance to say the least and is enjoyable,though clearly over the top.Things simmer along with not that many things to get excited about or to complain about,a solid but too familiar adventure that doesn't put our protagonists in serious harms way. Enter Mads Mikkelsen and TTT's most spot-on performance.As Rochefort,at times a thankless role,he again stands out and rises above the material. The one-eyed captan is at his core far from a coward,which we will see but he wants results,quick,sees no point in honor and is indifferent to how an adversary is beaten. A sleazy,cool baddie worthy of walking in Lees and Wincotts footsteps. Every time he strays from the narrative,things get a bit too harmless....and the movie is most fun when it strays actually,high in the sky. The third act raises The musketeers from a somewhat fun,somewhat hollow 5 to a 7. In the end,I judge Andersons job here,not on his own merits cause then this is a masterpiece but for it's genre. It's a fast-paced ride with airships,300 slow-mo,a finale with a duel on a rooftop to a majestic score that despite weaknesses and changes(NOT the same thing) is well worth the watch. I don't think Dumas would be spinning in his grave even remotely,I think he'd pop up and say:""This was brave and fresh...slightly dumb but thank you for breathing new life into my work.

They looked good... in a puppet way, though.I liked how Waltz didn't embarrass himself too much and how the three musketeers were ""okay"" characters.The thing is, the whole movie started as if it was a parody. The effects, the sounds, the ""characters"". As a fan of movies like the naked gun series, I can deal with parodies. However, the actors didn't seem to realise they don't have a real core. Beefing up the original by adding sky ships and machine guns was okay for me, the ""mission impossible"" like parts were fun to watch. I wasn't bored, I give them that.Still, Orlando and Milla were not easy to look at. I didn't like their parts at all and there wasn't any emotion. The love stories were really not worth the effort, because they didn't have any impact on me and were plot devices and things necessary, because some of them were part of the novel, but all in all they didn't amount to much.It was worth to be watched once, spending some time with popcorn in the cinema, but I am not tempted to watch it a second time.5/10",The Three Musketeers

(If you love THE story of three musketeers, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. It doesn't follow the book. Much.)SO I blame the script writer. The dialogue is weak, the characterization is bad, people's motivations are incomprehensible, the script writer took multidimensional characters and made paperdolls of them.The costumes are horrible. So horrible that I find it hard to not get distracted from the story. Why does the king look like the king of SPAIN? Why does the cardinal wear an armor? And what's with that... robe of his? I mean, the costumer took the one and only horribly misleading painting ever by Henri Motte to base his costumes on! And why would the Duke of Buckingham kiss the French Cardinal's ring? HE WASN'T EVEN CATHOLIC! When Milady faints in one second and the next starts show fighting, I gave up. In the original story Milady was intelligent and sharp and quick, and could manipulate anyone. Richelieu might have been the villain, but he was wise. He too was sharp and intelligent, but he was wise. He didn't want power to have power, he wanted power because of France, AND THE THING IS THAT HE WAS THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO France.I was really waiting for a treat with Christoph Waltz as Richelieu, and I knew Milla Jovovich's Milady would have some fighting scenes, YAY! I love feisty girls like that! But... starting with one scheme and change to another the next second and... no. It doesn't work that way! YOU MADE HER HOTHEADED AND STUPID. And no amount of chess is enough to convey how intelligent she is. Stupid! The manuscript writer is stupid! STUPID, STUPID, STUPID!!! So, no! No forgiveness for you for changing the story!

151,olsta1976,One for all and all for nothing,5,21 January 2012,"A disappointing adaptation of the Dumas classic.I think anyone over the age of 30 who still fondly remembers the Michael York and Oliver Reed 1973 classic will inevitably draw comparisons and on all fronts this film comes a woeful second best.The dialogue is atrocious. The acting, with the exception of Cristoph Waltz, is wooden and unengaging. Even the CGi laden sword fighting, complete with 300 style slow mo, feels strangely out of place.There really isn't much to recommend this film to anyone who has an age that does not end with the word teen.Do yourself a favour and watch the 1973 version online somewhere to see how it should be done.",The Three Musketeers
152,Naurya,"Good entertainment, but would have been better without anachronisms",3,1 September 2011,"Before I start writing down my impressions of this movie, I have to say that ""The Three Musketeers"" is one of my all-time favourite books. When I heard that a new Three Musketeers film was going to be released, I was really excited - all the more when I saw pictures of the beautiful locations in Bavaria and read that Christoph Waltz (""Inglorious Basterds"") would play my favourite character Richelieu. When I saw the trailer though, I was shocked: Matrix style bullet evasion? A Ninja diver? And... zeppelin air ships? WTF? I was sure Dumas was rotating in his grave over this mutilation done to his work! Really... I don't think a brilliant story like The Three Musketeers needs air ships in order to be exciting.Despite my frustration about the trailer, I decided to go to the cinema and I have to say, it was certainly not a total waste of time and money. First of all, the costumes and locations were extremely enjoyable. I watched the movie in 2D, but viewers will surely appreciate the 3D version. There are some nice effects like a bird's view onto a painted map of France.Most of the actors also did a great job, especially Christoph Waltz. He was amazing, just like I had always imagined Richelieu: this cool composure he has when something is not going according to his plans, but you can see how his brilliant brain is working on something new already. I also liked his interaction with the Louis XIII. The King was portrayed in a very exaggerated manner (clueless about politics, only interested in fashion and very childish), but this ironic exaggeration of his character created a lot of fun. Orlando Bloom was also great as Buckingham. You could see how he was enjoying himself in the role of the classy, spoiled and evil British ambassador. Logan Lerman as d'Artagnan surprised me positively. I thought he was just another boyish actor teenage girls will fall in love with. But he made a really good d'Artagnan and was able to show off his fencing abilities. Apparently all the fencing choreographies were done without the help of ropes or stuntmen - Respect! The final duel between Rochefort and d'Artagnan on the roof of Notre Dame was epic. It's a pity there wasn't more sword fighting instead of zeppelins. The actors of Athos, Porthos and Aramis also did a pretty good job, but had too little screen time and thus ended up as flat characters with only one trait of character each (Athos = the disillusioned drunkard, who has lost his love, Porthos = the vain daredevil, Aramis = the religious ladies' man). The musketeers as the title heroes really should be at the centre of the plot, but in this movie Milady and Buckingham got much more attention.Too much attention in the case of Milady. First of all, Milla Jovovich is not a good actress. Neither is she especially sexy, as the movie constantly tries to suggest. But I guess these factors don't play much of a role if you are married to the director... Secondly, I've always hated all these historical novels or films where ""emancipated"" women do stuff they just wouldn't have done in the century the plot is set in. And no, I'm pretty sure a woman of the 17th century would not have stripped on the roof of the palace and bungee jumped down. And no, she would not be able to win a sword fight against several Cardinal's Guards. And no group of three 17th century soldiers would have allowed a woman (in a huge gown not made for running) to draw the gunfire onto herself, so that they can go safe after she has activated the trap There were more anachronisms like that, the most obvious one being the air ships, but I won't even start ranting about them. The second most annoying anachronism was the portrayal of Rochefort: At the beginning, d'Artagnan challenges him to a duel, but Rochefort just shoots him before he can draw his sword. Outrageous for a 17th century nobleman! If there is one important ingredient you mustn't forget in a cloak-and-sword-film, it's the code of honour: you fight your enemy, but you're always noble and fair. The movie almost completely lacked this element. Also, why the heck does a Musketeer movie need a ""Mission Impossible"" scene with Milady climbing though a network of invisible wires? And why can d'Artagnan, after just one audience, stroll through the palace gardens with the King? Why does Buckingham accuse the King of wearing ""retro style""? – Even the soundtrack was anachronistic sometimes, when it suddenly changed from classical Hans-Zimmer-style to Pulp-Fiction-style – very irritating!But the anachronisms are not the only logical flaws in the movie: How did the French build an air ship in one week? (How do they fly and how are they steered anyway?) Why would a royal ship use a skeleton as a figurehead? (Answer: so that you get the Pirates of the Caribbean style) Why do the musketeers first try to get into the tower vault in order to get the diamonds, but then Athos suddenly knows that the diamonds won't be there anyway, but with Milady? How does Milady survive a fall of like 100 metres?Well, perhaps you should just switch off the logical part of your brain, when you go to see this movie! All in all, I had great fun watching it together with some friends. In the end it was better than I feared after seeing the trailers, but the sad thing is: it was worse than it could have been! All the ingredients for a great historical movie were there: excellent actors, beautiful locations and one of the best novels ever written as the basis! However, they just messed around too much with that great novel. You just can't improve a perfect story (not even with air ships), you can only make it worse.",The Three Musketeers
153,levitak,A great action movie!,10,18 October 2011,"There is one VERY important thing that everybody should know going into this movie. And that's that this is not about a faithful interpretation of the books. Nor is it about some deep drama. Anybody who is expecting this(or criticizing the movie for it) is frankly an idiot. From the beginning to the end the movie never hides what it is. Hell it show it quite clearly in the trailers as well. It's a truly great fun packed action movie. And that's it's essence. Fun action movie.Now for more details. First the question is the 3d worth it? Not really unless you have some money to spare. Is the 3d horrible. Also no. It's decent Nothing really worth paying additional money for but also it's not horribly done like so many conversions.However the visuals are rather great. You have some truly beautiful scenery and some pretty damn good action scenes. Not to mention the pretty people ;) Speaking of the people the acting was very decent. Milla Jovovich shines as milady. Combined the playfulness and deviousness with truly great ass kicking ability and some extremely well executed abilities. Not to mention that her stunning beauty is even more visible here. Also bonus to Gabriel Wild as Constance who is the very picture of innocent and angelic looking The Three Musketeers are great. They have a great chemistry and yet each one manages to shine on his own.D'Artagnan does have that ""little sh*t"" as pointed out by several characters vibe but I think mostly due to how the actor looks On the villain side we have some great performances. From the great performance of the calculating Cardinal to the wonderful basterd that is Rochefort who is truly fun as a villain who never plays fair even if he has all the advantages :) Orlando Bloom makes a very decent semi bad guy who also shows surprising comedic talent As for the movie itself it doesn't take itself too seriously but it also doesn't fall into the idiotic and over the top vibe(yes despite Airships)rather if has the vibe of an 90's action movie. The great action combined with surprisingly good humor. If you like things like Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and co chances are good you will enjoy this well so I would recommend seeing itAnd just as a warning this is the kind of movie that truly attracts hate since it's an easy target. An American movie perverting a french book? It's practically every internet troll to complain about things about this. However if you enjoy epic action packed thrill rides don't pay attention to this people and just go out there and enjoy the hell out of this movie ;)",The Three Musketeers
154,charlesdickins,A piece of art,9,16 February 2012,"Wow!First let me say that i have read the other reviews and agree / contra disagree with them. I am not approaching this film as an independent element, but rather as a large fan of all the Musketeer films. This one ROCKS! It's not out to get an academy award. It follows some of it's predecessors in giving pure entertainment (remember that the critics didn't like The Fifth Element at first either, but turned their cowardly tails when the public hailed it as a success). The Three musketeers has all you want from a matinée adventure! Humour, action, suspense, and surprises. Well done Luc Besson! You provide scenes that make you want to hold your breath and still stick true to the original source material. Plus you add a pinch of spice from your French roots...Notre dame amongst others. Give this film a try if you want entertainment, some fine performances (check out the young actor who plays Dartongnon) and an escape from reality.I have watched 7 Musketeer films and this is the second best (only being bested by the 1973 version).

For those guys who wine about it not being true to the book by Alexandre Dumas, after watching the trailer showing airships and ""Mission Impossible"" like scenes, please...what did you expect...The actors all did a fine job, even Mila Jovovich and Orlando Bloom where o.k..The mix of elements in this Movie, was quiet nice...If you like ""Pirates Of the Caribean"", ""Le pacte des loups""/""Brotherhood of the Wolf"", ""Fanfan la Tulipe"" (1952), Jules Verne, Steam Punk or Alan Moores ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" - comic that is, this maybe one for you...and i recommend the 3D version...",The Three Musketeers
156,Manos_Mantzas,"I'm going to give a 5 because of the great cast, although the spaceships where missing... :D",5,16 January 2012,"Although I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi, I believe that the movie just tries too much! Since I've seen every previous movie based on The Three Marketeers novel and I may say that I'm a big fan of the book and the previous movies, especially the last one, The Three Musketeers (1993), I can say that the writers took a perfect and tested story, a fine cast, a superb visual effects department and tried to give a different perspective to the movie. Their addition of the air fights and the ""air ships"", I think it's too much for a movie categorized to Action | Adventure | Romance. Don't get me wrong. I could accept the whole concept in case the movie was not portraying the actual historical era, but was placed in an alternative universe, like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004) for example. The only things that saves the moment, making the movie actually worth seeing are the performances of the fine cast and the great work of the visual effects department. Milla Jovovich is absolutely stunning as expected, Orlando Bloom is a very convincing Duke of Buckingham, Logan Lerman is a worthy D'Artagnan both in dialogs and action scenes, while the performances of the rest of the cast are truly exceptional. What is also missing a lot is the unification and solidarity of the Musketeers core. In the entire movie we never see the rest of them fight and do their part and even worse the only time we hear ""One for all and all for one"" is at the very end. Even worse the movie lucks a powerful song like the previous movie had. I guess the producers could afford spending $75,000,000 to unnecessary air fight visual effects, but could not spend a few of them in order to have a truly powerful song like ""All for love"" Performed by Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart and Sting in the previous movie. All in all, if you really want to see a great Musketeers movie just see the previous one, for it really succeeds where this one fails with less than half the budget of this one.",The Three Musketeers

There is not a single dull moment, action is syringed in every scene and the story, though (ehm uhm) non-linear and predictable, holds good till the end. While dialogues are slightly trite, the effects are nippy. The beauty of 17th century Paris and the grandeur of royal palaces (though certainly overdone), is nothing short of breathtaking. In all fairness, and especially when contrasted with Pirates of Caribbean 4, and HP8, it's one of the better movies of this year.

It's Renaissance-punk styling and and it's dedication to flash over substance may not have won it any acclaim, but it sure does make it a visual treat.

For those who would believe that 3D is simply a gimmick to cover up weak scripting and acting then this would be a good example to use. There are good points - the visuals - and these would include the 3D aspect - are very good indeed. Vivid colours and sets (a bit heavily computer animated) make Paris, London and Venice look fantastic. I think the aim of the film makers was to end up with a Pirates of the Caribbean rival and they clearly hoped to set up a franchise. If they had made some kind of decision regarding the pitching of the movie they might have managed this. Make no mistake - this is a movie for kids. My 8 year old boy thought it was pretty good - the adults present thought it was pretty awful. So tone down the violence and romance a little and you would have had a perfectly acceptable movie for children. Unfortunately this one falls in between the two. Overall - a decent idea badly executed. Stick to the 1973 original if you want to see the novel done justice - or decent acting - or if you are over 10 years old.",The Three Musketeers

If I want something serious, I'll just pick up his book.The cast is excellent and the swordplay was fantastic! The sweeping landscapes, grandiose castles and elaborate settings are all to die for.

165,frog1385,Dumas--mangled beyond recognition,1,14 April 2014,"I had never heard of this movie and ran across it in the library today. Because I have loved Alexandre Dumas' ""Three Musketeers"" since the first time I read it, I was anxious to see what a new production would look like. Needless to say I was appalled. The screenwriters have completely abandoned the plot, keeping only the names of the characters. If this is a spoiler, make the most of it. I've read many of the other IMDb reviews, and I think those who like this film are age 12 or under. I watched only the first 10-15 minutes before coming to IMDb to see what this film was about. The only thing I liked was the look of the actors who played the principal roles. Everyone was well suited to the role from a visual point of view. And Mila Jojovich was pretty cute. What more do you want from her?The first version I ever saw was the Gene Kelly, Lana Turner movie of 1948. Kelly was totally miscast, but the film was enjoyable nevertheless. The only version that I really liked was Richard Lester's Three and Four Musketeers. Wonderful production values that evoked the 17th century. They stuck to the plot religiously, but I was disappointed that they made it so campy, too much like a parody as if viewers couldn't take a really romantic piece of literature.Nothing is perfect for a perfectionist, but this film is really, really bad.",The Three Musketeers
166,ensnowed,A sequel? Don't do that to yourself Anderson....,5,13 December 2011,"D'Artagnan (Lerman) comes to Paris as a poor country boy, and by pure and arrogant stupidity counters the Three Musketeers played by the life-sick Athos(MacFayden), the 'priest' Aramis(Evans) and the rude Porthos(Stevenson). By chance they fight Rochefort (Mikkelsen) together and eventually turn against Cardinal Richelieu (Waltz), the Duke of Buckingham (Bloom) and Aramis' love Milady (Jovovich).To start, I was skeptically towards the film, but the trailer created great expectations. I saw the making-off/preview and enjoyed it enough to decide to watch it. And I was disappointed. Firstly, I believed the sword fighting was extremely well done. It was very well choreographed and quite realistic. What I also enjoyed was the start of the film, the introduction of the characters. Original, clear, short and strong. But then there was Lerman, playing an arrogant young boy wanting to join the musketeers. His acting was mediocre, boring and actually not as funny as he was probably intended to be. Even though enough time was spent on him, his character didn't develop during the film. He continued being that cocky arrogant bastard, and not enjoyable. I was content with MacFayden, Evans and Stevenson, though, who each played their role convincing. The story didn't let them develop their characters enough and didn't let you get to know him. Bloom as the villain was interesting, but failed miserably. He plays a man, much too involved with fashion, to the point of annoyance. He tried too hard to be something he is not. Waltz and Jovovich were actually convincing in this not very complicated and way too simple story. What didn't became clear in the film was the role of Waltz, to me. Was he against the king, or wasn't he? And what the hell was he trying to pull? I didn't get it. The 3D effects were unnecessary, as was the logic of the story. If there even was any... At moments, I enjoyed it, for it was actually quite amusing at times, but don't watch this if you'd enjoy a good film with a good storyline. Further, Anderson didn't quite succeed in trying to make the commercial success he hoped it would be. Maybe he should try something else beside directing, for the film was quite boring and was only saved by some of the cast. What I found extremely annoying, is the difference in accents. Some from France speak English, others speak American. Some from England speak English, others speak with an American accent. Note to actors: be consistent. Lastly, what disappointed me most in the film, was the not so subtle hint for a sequel. Anderson, don't do that to yourself....",The Three Musketeers
167,alexbet,More bang for the buck... than actually needed,5,5 July 2012,"Just in case you've been living under a rock for the past four centuries (and in which case, you would also have to be immortal), D'Artagnan is a historical, not a fictional character. As were the Musketeers. What's NOT historical is flying blimp-ships, 360º rotary cannons, and portable bungee gadgets straight out of Ethan Hunt's secret weapons closet in Mission Impossible.Unfortunately, that's a lot of what you'll see in this movie, thanks to the film makers' never ending quest to treat us as popcorn-eating children, rather than an actual minimally educated audience, who already has some notion of who Alexandre Dumas' D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers are. The original novel is the reason I went to see this movie, and what I left is was an ""oh my god, I can't believe they actually did this"" feeling.It really does NOT live up to the expectations if you're hoping for a straight-ahead story full of romance, CREDIBLE action and intrigue, as is the case with Stephen Herek's version of the famous novel, or any other version for that matter.However, truth be told, not all things are bad.The locations and the sets are just absolutely gorgeous. The production designers did a wonderful job in conveying what you imagine are the halls of the Parisian royal palace in all its grandeur and glory.As it relates to actors, Matthew MacFadyen completely transforms into Athos with his deep voice, Christoph Waltz - who I have been a huge fan of since I saw him in Inglorious Basterds - is hilarious in the role of the scheming, witty yet funny Richelieu, and the ladies' favorite, Logan Lerman isn't too shabby as D'Artagnan either. Mads Mikkelsen makes for a great Rochefort, Freddy Fox is OUTSTANDING as the naive king, and even James Cordin make for a hilarious servant.The only thing that I felt was missing was a little more of Waltz's humor, as he has more than proved to have the skill to take it well above any expectation you would have of him as a character, and as an actor.Mila Jovovich... I could do without. Although I realize her persona really fits Milady de Winter's character, it doesn't seem too lady-like when a... lady (pardon the redundancy) is seen sliding back-first on the floor, or getting down on her undies (which, in a period film, is exactly what those garments were) to rappel 16 feet down. Although that alone doesn't speak of her ability as an actor, but rather the writer's, her overall lack of charisma and relatable persona as an actress does. But as one reviewer put it, it doesn't hurt to be married to the film's director.Simply put, if you want to have a good ol' popcorn-movie time, please, have at it. You'll have plenty of silliness going on to feast your eyes and ears with.However, if you're more of the purist kind of fan, and you REALLY want to see a really well produced version of Alexandre Dumas' novel... This isn't it. Although the production value is there, sadly, the story leaves a lot to be desired, and ultimately, what greater story is there, than that of bravery, loyalty, romance and intrigue than that of D'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers?If you're in for the former, have fun.If you're looking for the latter, save your precious time and money.",The Three Musketeers
168,linaskk,Here musketeers go again.,6,15 November 2011,"If Alexandre Dumas lived after the invention of cinema, he would be damn good script writer, I bet. His novel The Three Musketeers"" has been interpreted on screen countless of times not without a reason, even Mickey, Donald and Goofy combo played it back in 2004 (""All for fun, fun for all""). So, here musketeers come again, this time directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, empowered by quite impressive cast: women melting Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings, Kingdom of Heaven), Academy Award nominee Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds) and supermodel Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil, The Fifth Element).The Three Musketeers"" begins with ""Assassin's Creed"" or ""Prince of Persia"" game series style presentation of the characters (for those, who are unfamiliar with the titles, it's stealth action games, filled with various ninja'ish special effects). Modern Athos (Matthew Macfadyen) reborns as a diving assassin equipped with gadgets worth even Batman's attention, Aramis (Luke Evans) becomes a roof jumping renaissance ninja and Porthos (Ray Stevenson) seems to have gotten some supernatural strength Ignoring those new super abilities they got, the cast of three old musketeers does really solid performance, although there are not much space for expressing their potential because of the lack of dialogues and focus of the plot being on other characters (D'Artagnan, King, Richelieu). Another big figure in the plot, Milady (Milla Jovovich), joins trio in robbing Da Vinci's vault (!), Milady performs slo-mo-bullets-escaping-twelve-years-old Matrix"" like run through trapped corridor and after reaching the goal – plans of modern warfare – betrays musketeers.A year passes, musketeers feel betrayed, lost their way and motivation (""We are warriors, but there is no one to fight""). France is ruled by young, good-hearted, deeply fallen in love and totally not interested in politics King Louis XIII(Freddie Fox), which is manipulated by cunning Richelieu. And here comes hot tempered gaskon garçon named D'Artagnan (young Logan Lerman) and spices things up by challenging all three old musketeers to a duel. Paul Anderson was not very original here and used original Dumas's idea of how quadruplet got together and united for saving the honor of France and fighting Richelieu's (Christoph Waltz) bodyguards. At this point new musketeer's era begins. New era full of action, rapier battles, special effects, airship fights and mediocre jokes begins The new version is pumped with visual effects, most of them obviously designed for 3D version. The battle of airships with massive flamethrowers on top might actually be interesting if only you are able to get rid of idea scratching somewhere inside your head that something is just not right. Unfortunately, most of other, almost iconic, action scenes is seen somewhere else: escaping bullets, fighting on the rooftop or crossing ""lasers"" corridor leaves bitter taste in your mouth.This story adaptation does not come anywhere close to the level of entertainment Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes gives, but if you are looking for brainless action movie with some nice costumes and landscapes The Three Musketeers still might be your pick. If you are not into this kind of movies or just like Dumas's original story – simply stay away from it.",The Three Musketeers

It had everything in a movie that I wanted,sexy actors amazing effects and a compelling story. The story is sorta the same from the Disney Musketeers, its just been revamped with some effects and they added a little effect there that I think made the whole story just come together perfectly. Aramis in this movie is devilishly handsome, Athos with his deep voice and Porthos with his cocky self, it was all perfect. Orlando was wonderful as a villain, so much that I kept finding it hard to believe that I wanted to see more of him on the screen. The young king is hilarious, he is constantly changing clothes and wanting approval from everyone around him. The only thing that I didn't care for was Milla, her part was good but I just wanted to strangle her a few times.

It just wants you to sit and watch; - People who won't be able to get past what it could have BEEN rather than just accepting what it IS and ISN'THITS: (or MISSES, Depending on your taste) - Casting a balance of recognizable and bankable names (Milla Jovovich as Milady, Orlando Bloom as the Duke of Buckingham) with skilled (Christoph Waltz as Richelieu) and convincing (Ray Stevenson as Porthos) actors; - Visual effects and scenery showing glimpses of castles, skies, Europe, places most folks don't get to see; - An element of Da Vinci; - A precarious duel scene; - Characters pumped up with superhero-like skills and abilities, if you're into thatMISSES: - Fails as an adaptation or period/historic piece (remember, ACCURACY is not among its objectives); - Reeking of anachronisms (too many to list!) and illogical elements. Yes, you MUST suspend your disbelief; - Some tepid action sequences tamed further by slow-motion shots that make you feel like doing away with the weaponry and just slapping each other to death would have been more brutal and satisfying (Seriously, a swordfight with hardly a drop of blood shed?); - Writing is weak and characters poorly developed. They give an overview to stamp the personalities and skills of each character in the opening scenes and that's it; - Acting is bland. Even Waltz couldn't squeeze out enough from his material to make Richelieu darker, devious, cunning, or evil. He should strike fear into your heart that will leave no doubt that crossing him would bring you severe pain and torture. Rather here, Jovovich's Milady probably just rolls her eyes at him with the expression we now universally recognize as, ""Whatever!"". As for the rest, Bah! - Neither the script, acting, nor direction would elicit your sympathy for any of the characters or their situations. This is ultimately the saddest compromise. It is void of love or chemistry between two ""lovers"", you can't relate to anyone, you won't feel sorry for anyone betrayed, there is no sense of urgency nor anything to cheer for or clap for once ""good"" triumphs over ""evil"", and there is no camaraderie and bonding between the main protagonists that evokes ""All for one, and one for all!"" You got friends who would die or kill for you? Well, these guys don't seem like they'd leave a bar at happy hour to help the other in need. Three Musketeers only in tarnished name. More appropriately: Three and a Half Man- fighters, or Four Men and a (Mi)Lady.BOTTOMLINE: This will work only if you're a casual movie-goer. It is flawed, unoriginal, lacking, and nowhere near the standard of the classic novel it was named after or even the standards for a ""good"" movie. If you can temper your expectations, you can salvage some entertainment value and maybe even like it enough to see it again on HBO. It is okay to watch on a big screen (cinema or home theater) for its visuals but not to shell out extra for 3D.",The Three Musketeers
171,camordini,Fun in a modern parody sort of way,7,7 June 2013,"Come on guys, it wasn't that bad. A fun and light hearted period piece with sword play and costumes. Some witty banter and a few plot twists. It is not ""based on"" The Three Musketeers by Dumas, but rather ""inspired by"" the book. Aside from the characters, I wouldn't expect much loyalty to the book. The movie is full of tributes to every sort of action movie ever made including some ninja action, Jules Verne, Mission Impossible stunts and lines right out of Clint Eastwood. Made me laugh, but I guess it just annoyed other people. My favorite performance was Logan Lerman as Dartagnan. He had the perfect mix of too young, too small and full of way too much bravado- so cute. The men were swashbuckling and the women were smart and capable. This is a fun Friday night family movie, appropriate for all ages. If you want Dumas, read the book!",The Three Musketeers

Athos,Porthos and Aramis were in good form with some funny side. But the real stand out was Milla Jovovich as Milady. Milady is sweet,cunning and evil. Its her outstanding portrayal of Milady that makes the film a drama classic and one of the best in its time. I advise everyone not to skip this outstanding jewel-in-the-case.",The Three Musketeers
174,gainadan,Lack of imagination and shameful plot,1,3 April 2012,"It is very hard to overweight Alexandre Dumas. It is not a crime to try and fail, but to preposterously change history, murder characters, take out key elements of the story it is the closest thing to literary crime. As we can see, somebody not only did that, but succeeded to put it into a movie. That is the only success the movie had. Luckily nobody tried to change the genders of the musketeers but unfortunately the four main characters had little to do along the movie. It was much more easy to use one or two of them, because the other ones were just a waste of script. There is no might in Porthos, no mystery or wisdom in Athos, no priesthood in Aramis. The original story is downgraded to the extreme. I am a fan of the books written by Alexandre Dumas so for fans the movie starts to stink after the first minutes. That is why there is no reason to go into details about how the actors played and why the interpretation was so lame. There are some enjoyable moments but the bitter taste of insufficient imagination spoils the overall experience. My question was why they bother to take a well-known classical story, when is easier to write a new one and go with it. There is a clear trend of distorting the old stories and make them fit ""panem et circenses"" because most of movie industry is mediocre. The only way that trend is reversed is by treating second hand work for what it is and marl it clearly. Like this we may give in the future a chance to young viewers to enjoy real plots, good scripts and excellent movies. Unfortunately this movie is not even a classical example of failure it's just a product of consumerism, see it, throw it away and make space for the next lame one.",The Three Musketeers
175,nira_jaga,Limited,5,18 January 2012,The Three Musketeers has been made and remade at least a dozen times in history after Alexander Dumas's writing came out. We keep expecting the next one to be better than the last and perhaps it's that expectation that lets us down sometimes.The movie has some wonderful effects and visuals thanks to modern technology and advancements in cinema but that's all I enjoyed. The actors were fantastic people but used poorly and did not have enough role to bring out the characters they were meant to portray. And the cliché dialogues brought this one down.It's a nice one if you're not expecting too much historical accuracy or anything else but I personally have seen older versions of the same movie which are far better.,The Three Musketeers
176,kaoskode@swbell.net,Disappointed,5,17 November 2012,This could have been a great movie it had a good cast of mostly proved actors. Yet I found at least half of the time there was no heart in the acting. I could have lived with some of the tech they used even though it certainly isn't period but when I saw a wooden ship that was so heavy it would have never gotten off the ground with a blimp ten times the size much less the size it was well lets just be polite and say I had a lot of bad words for the idiots who dreamed up the monstrous clap trap it was.You would think that the director Paul W.S. Anderson would have had his fill of that in the resident evil movies but no he took a perfectly good story that I have liked every incarnation of it till now. And another thing I love Milla Jovovich but thought this may be one of her worst performances ever and I usually think she is very good.

Please, will no one in Hollywood hold anything sacred anymore. I'm surprised that this was even let to theaters. Did this pass an audience test. I don't think so!

The storyline is terribly poor, the jokes are not funny at all and the characters have absolutely no resemblance to what we read in the book, it seems the producers only used Dumas most famous characters to attract audiences; nobody would care for this movie if it wasn't for the characters and the title. The lack of inspiration is so big that even the theme song is a rip off from the theme of Sherlock Holmes (2009) by Hans Zimmer. But, if you have never read the book you might find this entertaining, who knows? There are people who actually liked Paul W.S.

179,webstefan2003,Why the hate ?,10,26 August 2021,"I don't get the hate for this movie, and this is coming from someone that absolutley loved Dumas's books as a child and I loved the Richard Chamberlain classics too. Yes sure does deviate a bit from the books and takes some poetic license liberties but the hart of it is there.In fact I think the only problem is that while the cast is great it's a bit upside down and they kind of make the villains more likeable than the protagonists kf the story but that's probably because Christoph Waltz is an absolute genious when it comes to ""bad guys"" and also you can tell Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovovich are having a blast playing the antagonists, I like the musketeers too but not as much as the vilains.I don't understand why it had such low box office numbers and such a low rating. For my money this should definitley have had a sequel.I rated it at 10 stars not because it deserves them but because I feel the ratings of 1-2 stars are just given out of some spite, to my mind it's around a 7 maybe 7.5 stars.So great cast, good story, the CGI is a bit lacking but there are few elements of CGI so it's not that annoying, great action sequences, beautiful costumes, fun experience all in all, no it's not a oscar masterpiece but it's a fun feel good action adventure movie with just enough comedy to make it worth a watch or more.",The Three Musketeers

After a failed attempt, however, they were dismissed and now live in obscurity in France. Then comes D'Artagnan, a hot-headed son of a former Musketeer, who provides Athos, Porthos, and Aramis a second chance at reliving the glory days of sword fighting. I have never heard of the story about the Three Musketeers before, but this movie is easy to follow. The movie is very cliché and there is not much to get out of the movie other than the fact that it serves an entertainment purpose. However, I decide to give this movie a high rating because of the wonderful Cinematography, Art Direction, and Costume design. Also, I enjoy Logan Lerman's humorous touch on D'Artagnan's personality. This movie is enjoyable if you are simply looking for a movie in which the sole purpose is to provide entertainment and family fun.",The Three Musketeers
181,hatton-1,Pirates of the Parisian Sky,6,16 October 2011,"The 2011 film version of The Three Musketeers 3-D is not simply a reboot of the popular Alexandre Dumas novel, rather it is a complete re-fashioning of the original story that has a lot in common with Pirates of the Caribbean. In fact, calling The Three Musketeers, The Pirates of the Parisian Sky would probably resonate more meaningfully with younger audiences. At times, the looting of iconic scenes from the past fifteen years of action- adventure cinema (e.g. The Matrix and 300) pushes the film into the realm of parody.Purists are likely to despise the film for its liberties and yes, introducing exotic floating airships into the plot, un-tethers it from its source material. Any logical historical links that The Three Musketeers once had are rendered as spurious details and rather, a campy Disney-esque tone infuses the film like the aforementioned Pirates.The way to approach this film is to forget any nostalgia that you may have for its origins and rather, to enjoy it as a swashbuckling adventure story. On this level, it is entertaining and the swordplay benefits from contemporary special effects and fighting styles, although, I have to say, Douglas Fairbanks is still my favorite master duelist.These days, the athleticism and skill of the old stars are replaced by rapid editing that is impressionistic. One is left with a vague sense of unease having been hoodwinked into believing you saw something that never really happened.The plot is fairly simple. D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman), a young hothead, sets off for Paris in order to hook up with the legendary musketeers – Aramis (Luke Evans), Porthos (Ray Stevenson) and Athus (Matthew Macfadyen). Unbeknown to them, a beautiful double agent Milady de Winter (Milla Jovovich) and Richelieu (Christoph Waltz) are plotting to overthrow the French royal family by plunging Europe into war. The diabolical plan can only be averted if the musketeers retrieve the royal family jewels. The setup is hokum but by the midway stage the film hits its groove, relying more on action set-pieces, than its threadbare humor. The 3-D presentation is well thought out, revealing the stunning locations like Versailles (actually a Bavarian castle) in all their Viewfinder glory. This offsets to some degree the solid cast who are unable to transcend their simply written archetypes.This is no classic and Dumas fans should stay away. That said, lovers of the Disney-esque swashbuckler are likely to find it fun.",The Three Musketeers

The acting were superb, the scripts were absolutely cheesy but somewhat expected from this kind of genre. I have no complaints whatsoever =D The fight scenes were fun and guess what: NO BLOOD!! That was like - perfect for me!!! The sight of blood was pretty rare throughout the movie =D it makes it watchable for a faint-hearted like me. (It also explains why it has better score from the female audience - check the vote statistic - Well, that AND the gorgeous main casts) The sequence didn't feel rushed, the music's just right, and there were more than enough humor inserted in every scene (light and tasteful humor, not the raw ones).

185,tmldtt,A whole lot of style and a serious lack of substance.,5,13 October 2011,"The Cast : Matthew Macfadyen. Milla Jovovich. Luke Evans. Ray Stevenson. Orlando Bloom. Logan Lerman. Mads Mikkelsen. Christoph Waltz. Extremely impressive.The Plot : Dumas' mix of high romance, swashbuckling adventure, and the intrigue and pomp of Louis XIII's court, shot in 3D. Sounds enthralling.The Director : Paul W.S. Anderson. Director of Death Race, AVP, Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil franchise. I am sorry, what?'The Three Musketeers' is a classic example of a director wasting an idea that sounds brilliant on paper with his over-indulgence. In his constant efforts to show off his love for special effects, the director sacrifices substance at the altar of style. And in comes steam-punk flying ships and bright colors into Dumas' masterpiece.If you are already retching at the idea, don't read no further. And skip this film. For those who can swallow the anachronisms, the film is stylish, colorful and expensive looking, complete with wicked action sequences, stunning costumes and lavish sets. And Anderson does know his craft of making 'senseless action flicks' and that shows with the amount of detail he has put in the action sequences. And the 3D, though breaking no new grounds, is pretty standard.Christoph Waltz is a treat to watch. Once again. Matthew Macfadyen, Luke Evans and Ray Stevenson know their craft but aren't given much chance to flourish. Mads Mikkelsen impresses too, while Bloom is okay at best. Milla Jovovich, being the director's wife, gets cast automatically. And she does the butt-kicking in style, but somehow you expect a zombie to pop out from somewhere in her sequences. Yes, there is a definite Resident Evil hangover. But Logan Lerman as D'Artagan is shamelessly bad. He single-handedly negates other actors' works with his pathetic expression(s).Considering the director's love for video games, it is far from surprising to find the musketeers' moves to be largely similar to Ezio's or Altair's from the Assassin's Creed video game series.The ending, which I won't spoil, leaves a lot to be desired. Plot ends are left untied, the climax uncooked, but not without the promise of a sequel.""Unus pro omnibus, omnes pro uno"" or ""One for all, all for one"" was the motto of Dumas' novel. Keeping true to that, Anderson and Lerman brings everyone else down with themselves.Dumas' novel deserves a proper silver screen adaptation. It is long due. And sadly, this movie is NOT that adaptation.I am going to go with 5 out of 10 for the film. It works as a mindless mayhem film, but fails disastrously as a novel adaptation.Go in the theater only if you want some senseless entertainment with a few good-looking action sequences. The rest of you, don't give a (Notre) Dame. :D",The Three Musketeers

187,adrenalinejunkiegurl,Not the Best Adaption But Loved It :),10,20 September 2011,"Honestly, this was not the best adaption of The Three Musketeers, but I personally enjoyed it a lot, despite it being in a different language and not understanding half of it. One of the reasons why is because the movie was very entertaining and the second reason is because I prefer not to compare both the movie and the books together since no movie is perfect when it comes to adapting it from a book, the only one that came pretty close was The Three Musketeers' 1970s version.I did not really mind the airships because Anderson did say in an article that he decided to use one of Da Vinci's war machines in the movie, and I just interpreted the airships as Buckingham just trying to find a way to defeat the nation of France. I did not mind it either when Milady bungee jumped from the roof practically half naked because, honestly, who would want to be bungee jumping in that kind of dress? Sure, it's a lot easier to fight in the dress, but do you really think it's going to be a whole lot easier trying to bungee jump and doing all those jumps and leaps up on the roof and in Queen Anne's room? Though the Milady in the actual book would probably never do anything like that, I did not mind it in the least because I believe if Milady is capable of murder, then she is capable of everything else. The movie was a bit humorous and all action, the plot seemed to go by too quickly in my opinion, but I just think the movie is good for entertainment.There was a lot of references to the book, though. Like for instance, Buckingham's ""letters"" to Queen Anne, the stealing of the Queen's diamonds, Athos and Milady's relationship-despite the complete differences between the book and this movie-, the affair between Milady and Buckingham, and finally England going to war with France. I won't go into full details of the book, you just have to read the book yourself but there are a lot of differences between them, but still some references to it.Some of the characters were a little off character, like Buckingham since in the book he wasn't really a bad guy, just a love-sick puppy, but I think (from the German version of the movie) that Orlando Bloom did not do so bad; in fact, he really made it seem plausible for him to play the role of the bad guy. Both Orlando and Milla really gave me chills, though, the sexuality between Milady and Buckingham really drew me into the story more because, just like the Milady in the book, the Milady in this movie was not your average go-to-church-and-stay-pure kinda 17th century woman. I believe Milady in both the book and the movies make the story more interesting because without her there would be no adventures. Although, I will agree with one review, there was too much attention on Buckingham and Milady and not enough on D'Artagnan, which is basically what the whole story is about: D'Artagnan. I also found it a little weird of how Milady was able to survive the fall from the airship, I do not find it plausible for a person to be able to survive after jumping 4000 (or higher, I suck with numbers) and landing in the water, but the movie is just meant for entertainment so I really do not care. I really hope that the next movie, though, will pay a little more attention to D'Artagnan (AND not to kill off Orlando! 'Cause I'll be so mad if Anderson did!)If you are one of those people who really expects this to be the perfect adaption, do not expect too much because no adaption is perfect and this is just one of those movies where you can just go watch a movie (say a Disney movie) and just escape from reality, that's what it is.",The Three Musketeers

The acting is perfection and Orlando Bloom plays a great bad guy. I did also love a lot of the other characters.

The bits of comedy that were there, such as the ticket giving for a horse dumping in the street was subtle but good. I found that funny, even though most people probably don't.The visual aspects were great.

190,rsn711,This is a very bad movie.,3,29 August 2017,"This is a very bad movie. I of course knew that before watching it, but I hoped it would be one of those mindless, turn-your-brain off and enjoy bad movies. You know the type. The kind of movie that everyone tries to convince you Suicide Squad is. But, alas.I was hopeful because The Three Musketeers is a classic tale with source material ripe for adaptation. Add in Christoph Waltz as a scenery-chewing villain, and there was real potential. But, in Paul WS Anderson I trusted, and therein lies my mistake.There are two glaring issues with this movie as I see it: an absolute failure to establish any sort of charming camaraderie between the titular ""Musketeers"", and lackluster action sequences. The former issue is a critical failure, because the heart and soul of a movie about the Three Musketeers has to be a believable relationship between the characters we are supposed to root for. Instead we spend no time with our heroes, with nothing to establish why they are in fact our heroes, before the film moves on and leaves us behind.Regarding the latter issue, I admit that perhaps I am bringing a bias to my viewing of this movie since plenty of other people have praised the action. Watching martial arts movies where the actors are real- life practitioners of the fighting style they are using has made me much less tolerant of poorly-trained actors that look like they are trying harder to remember the routine they practiced than actually sell the fight. I was left totally uninspired and, quite frankly, bored by the swordplay featured in the film.There are certainly other issues with the film as well. Something you can always count on in a Hollywood-produced period piece is the inconsistency with which an accent will be utilized, and The Three Musketeers certainly didn't let me down in this regard. Matthew Macfadyen goes with British, Logan Lerman sticks to American, Christoph Waltz does his best French, Milla Jovovich is doing...something, and Orlando Bloom does his best Spongebob mocking meme a good 6 years before it becomes a thing.The CGI was blatant and gratuitous, though I will cut the film some slack since I watched in 2017 so the technology is already outdated. But even after everything I've brought up, one of the most frustrating issues with this film is the way the plot absolutely jumps the shark at the end. Without saying too much, we get a thoroughly unsatisfying conclusion to what should have been the explosive confrontation between the Musketeers and Waltz's Richelieu.Ultimately this was a waste of time. I know this film grossed more than its budget, but when adding in marketing costs it doesn't seem like it made a profit. If anything, I would assume it broke even. And in a world where we give Transformers and Johnny Depp's latest Pirates dreck billion-dollar grosses, at least this movie seems to have failed.",The Three Musketeers

Surely it was time to out-do Disney's version from so many years ago.Initial impressions and the trailer were promising, and I thought that the cast would probably do it justice.Alas, it was not to be. Although somewhat entertaining to watch, the script is absolutely dreadful. The most redeeming factors of the movie are probably the King and Queen and their young life and relationship, and James Corden's comedic bits, but most of the rest of the characters were (unusually) shallow and... dare I say, poorly portrayed. How very disappointing. It's a decent movie to watch for free, but save your money. In fact, I'd much rather waste it on Disney's version.",The Three Musketeers
193,ellanegri,"Falls just short of ""so bad it's good""",3,21 March 2017,"Let's put aside the fact that it doesn't follow the original message of the story or, you know, the story itself. It can be forgiven for that, as well as asinine elements like Milady surviving and the Musketeers deciding that the best way to forestall a war between France and England was to blow up the Duke of Buckingham's house. The high production value adds it's part to make it at least visually interesting. The continued appearance of familiar faces will make you say ""oh, it's so-and-so"", which is just about the most fun you'll have all movie. The fatal flaw of this film is, without a doubt, the script. It is so cliché and modernized that I amused myself by guessing what line would come next and was right an unnerving amount of the time. The jokes all fell flat, the Mission Impossible style of action made me want to cry, and it was clear that the actors were rushing their way through the lines as quickly as possible to collect their money. It made me smile that someone actually got paid to write this script, and then whoever played Constance got paid to look like she was reading off of cue cards every time she was on screen. Let's talk about the actors, none of whom are French or bothered to try for a French accent. Watching the good guys was like watching paint dry. The Musketeers, who are all good actors, looked bored to tears, and while that might have worked for a time due to the rut their characters are in, it soon became clear that Matthew MacFayden's brain was taking a nap while he let his deep vocal chords say the lines, hoping the baritone would cover the necessary bases. Luke Evans did his hair in a mirror and knew that that would be enough to keep girls watching, so he didn't even bother. Ray Stevenson had the most charisma, and so predictably got the least screen time. Logan Lerman tried, but seemed more like he needed to go back to high school than one of the greatest swordsmen in France. I already discussed whatever Constance was supposed to me. A mannequin, perhaps. It seemed that the King and Queen had the only real character and heart in the entire film, which is unfortunate because she is barely in it and he is a dunce.Oh also there is a character who is supposed to be comic relief played by James Corden. Casting Oscar winners and fan favorite as villains almost guaranteed a complete overshadowing of the heroes, though this didn't make them exponentially more interesting. Christoph Waltz is good enough that he would have to try to fail, but he clearly regretted buying whatever it was that necessitated the salary of this movie. Milla Jovovich pretty much just did what she does every movie, which is not always a plus. Mads Mikkelsen gets a shout out for at least trying to do a good job despite awful lines and zero character development, and per the usual Mads, succeeding very well. At least he looked cool and managed to deliver his lines with a straight face and a certain amount of menace. I do feel that he broke character at the time of his ridiculous death, where I could have sworn that he was visibly relieved at finally being able to leave this travesty of a film. Orlando Bloom alone gets full stars as being the only person, including the audience, having any fun, and having a lot of it. Bottom line is, unless you need a really good laugh, this is all Redbox has to offer or you're a big enough Bloom or Mikkelsen fan that you want to see them as another cool minor character, skip this one.",The Three Musketeers
194,Built11,Putting aside all of that...,2,22 March 2012,"Putting aside logic and believability, this film should be entertaining in a swashbuckling and adventurous kind of way. Granted, the film makes no attempt to adhere to Dumas' novel, and in fact gleefully heads off in opposite directions altogether; about 15 opposite directions all at once! The mish-mash of styles, of gimmicks, props, sets and periods all work to keep the viewer nicely confused and generally in the dark as to any sense of authenticity that the film might claim. The main focus is on characters who aren't Musketeers, like Milady de Winter, who is sexy, young, sexy, talented, sexy, treacherous, sexy, seemingly immortal, and who oozes blatant sex appeal; all of which assets are especially odd for a woman in Europe of the early 1600s.But putting aside all that, this film is entertaining. Granted, the characters are flat and one-dimensional, and little effort has been made to actually develop them beyond caricatures. Milady, played with inexplicable gusto as a dangerous sexpot who offers little else to the story beyond director Anderson's vain attempts to inappropriately inject sex-appeal into a story that has no place for it. Lerman attempts to give D'Artagnan something beyond the script's awful humor, but is, perhaps, constrained by the director's seeming insistence on creating a smart-ass parody instead of a believable and realistic character. The rest of the main cast struggle to give reality to their characters, but are also restricted by the amateurish script and weak direction into portraying their parts as pencil-sketches instead of oil-paintings.But putting aside all of that, this film is entertaining. Granted, creating physics-bending air-ships with cannons that manage to achieve astonishing forward velocity with tiny sails (not to mention lifting what must be tons of weight with rather small balloons) may not have been a good idea. And dodging bullets and cannon-balls in physically impossible slo-mo scenes lifted directly from ""The Matrix"" may not have been the best choice for injecting sexy talent to a female role. And when Milady pauses knowingly at the entrance to the secret chamber, then producing a white powder on her hand she blows it into the chamber to expose a network of invisible trip-wires, well, one can be forgiven for thinking one is watching ""Mission Impossible"". And when she vaults through the wires, voluminous skirts and all, without tripping a single one, the viewer can be forgiven for thinking he's watching Zeta-Jones in 1999's ""Entrapment"". But it's the story that counts, not the small things like flying schooners, invisible trip-wires and, uh believability.But putting aside all of that, this film is entertaining. Granted, the script does little to further the story beyond informing the viewer of what's going on, between soggy attempts at humor and lame efforts at wit. The audience's groans may well drown out dialogue, and that's probably OK too, since one won't lose much by missing the amazingly sorry interaction between characters who attempt to salvage poor writing by injecting emotion and passion, all to no avail.But putting aside all of that, this film is entertaining. I mean look at the fight scenes and the sword-play. It's good, and the actors were allowed, finally, to shine! An amazing, if somewhat impractical sword-fight takes place on the roof of Notre Dame, as thrilling and suspenseful as any that I've seen before. And granted, for a character, a lady of the times at that, to single-handedly trounce a dozen well-trained soldiers and personal guards of the king in a sword-fight, well OK, it's a bit out-there. But still, the sword fights were great, and they injected some action that was a bit more believable than flying schooners and a lady ninja in huge skirts and sexy eyes in early-1600s France.But, putting aside all of that, this film is entertaining, right? Oh, wait Uh Putting aside all of that, I guess there isn't anything left to entertain me.Oops Never mind!",The Three Musketeers

Many beautiful actors, fantastic 3D images, lots of fantasy, and uplifting locations. The special effects are very, very well done. I can get easily offended by most movies, nowadays, but this was perfectly ""clean"". So it was a lot of relaxing fun and a beauty for the eyes. Actors play with an original type of humor and the action scenes are intentionally ""over the top"" to be fun as well and intense and beautiful. It is a ""feel good"" movie, to be enjoyed alone, or with girlfriend/boyfriend or together with friends. The 3D images are super well done.",The Three Musketeers
196,jason-michael-rowe,Terrible re-make,1,14 February 2012,"This film was so bad it made me want to cry. After watching for just over an hour I switched off. The main sticking point for me here is the way they seemed to be trying very hard at trying to make it seem somehow different to the 73 version, or the '90s version. However it was as though they took the script, cut it up, removed bits and pieces, jumbled the rest up and then threw it back together again. What we're left with is a film that made little or no sense, minus any slapstick humour, or intrigue. It is all very pretty....the costumes are lovely and the CGI is barely passable, all the actors are quite pretty too. Doesn't really matter if they can act. The feel of the film is far too clean for me. The props, costumes, scenery all look out of place. The flying ship, the underwater breathing apparatus, and the hi=tech looking security system protecting the diamonds were just completely baffling. I won't even go into how bad Orlando Bloom is. And whoever cast James Corden in this film needs shooting.Just stick to the 73 version, which is my favourite by far.",The Three Musketeers

Also enjoy the 5 minutes of dialog and plot that sentence by sentence matches The Wrath of Khan.Abysmal overuse of slow motion pathetic cliché ""action"" scenes is the least of this films numerous flaws. I literally laughed out loud at how bad this film was. There was only one person in the theater who wasn't groaning aloud, and I she was so drunk she narrated for our benefit: ""Athos!""

Maybe it is because of my taste, maybe I like more intense and unpredictable movies, but I expected a lot more. There were some really odd elements, which look like artificially added, in relation to the time of the action, the dawn of XVII century, like the Da Vinci vault and how it was made look like, also the flying war machines battle. Also the ""shallow"" ending, which showed even the blind people that there will be a sequel, could easily be replaced with three simple words - ""to be continued"". I mean letting go the great conspirator, doesn't matter what the planned to do, even if he's the cardinal himself is a bit strange to me.

200,arnd-mueller,worst Musketeer ever,3,11 September 2011,"When I first saw the trailer, I was happy that someone tried a new musketeer movie. Because they were always my favorite hero characters. But when I watched the movie, after 2 minutes, I realized that it's just another ""Milla Evil movie"", flying high in the air killing' baddies. What seems to work in Resident evil, feels much from outer space in this movie. But maybe that's what the Director wanted, because, believe it or not, it got flying air ships as well. I wonder if any one doing this movie, hast ever read Alexandre Dumas books, about the musketeers.This movie is one of the worst musketeer movies, ever made, they even shot this movie in Bavaria, not in France!If you looking' forward for a good sword fighting musketeer movie, I would recommend, the 3 Oliver Reed movies, which are close to the books, and a lot more fun to watch.And please, don't think about, giving' us sequels, to this trash.",The Three Musketeers
201,goebel-c,"""Nuking the fridge"" is harmless in comparison to what this film does",2,3 September 2011,"First of all I ought to note that I did not expect much of this film - and yet was left completely underwhelmed. There are some major issues regarding this film which I would like to address, they are the reason for my extraordinarily low ranking, which would have been even lower if I had not thought it disrespectful to those actors who did their job very well (against all odds).One may argue that screen adaptations require some changes to be made to the original material, and I wholeheartedly agree, but the changes made to this particular adaption are so fundamental they might as well not have bothered to call it The Three Musketeers"". There is as good as nothing left of the original plot in this movie, and what is left of it is changed beyond recognition. I did expect it to be more action laden than ultimately necessary, I expected it to deviate from the original plot, but nothing could possibly have prepared me for this shipwreck of a film. One might think that while a film shouldn't be required to follow the book's plot word by word to qualify for bearing the title of a famous novel - one should be able to tell it is supposed to be based on said novel, right? Apparently not. Apart from the title and the the names of the characters, there is but little that would betray it to be even roughly based on Dumas' novel. Buckingham is turned from lover to evil Lord, and Queen Anne into a blameless little lamb who fell prey to the Cardinal's machinations. No such thing as the fleur-de-lis is even mentioned. Constance doesn't only not die, she isn't even threatened by Milady. And that's just a selection. One might be led to think it was deliberately conceived as a parody of remakes. After all, it has all the ingredients – a butchered plot, characters with any debt taken out of them (despite the fact that if given the chance, most actors would have delivered an outstanding performance, but the time usually assigned to character development is devoured by sexy"" scenes featuring Milla Jovovich – who herself is a whole other problem), references to everything from the Matrix to Mission Impossible, goodness – it even has airships. Airships. Not one, not two, but an entire armada of airships. I understand that Rocheford's eye patch is tempting, but they might as well have put a parrot on his shoulder, it would not have managed to make it appear any more ridiculous. I was surprised they did not venture to release an air Kraken. If this film had had less Milla Jovovich, no airships and if anyone had bothered to actually read ""The Three Musketeers"" beforehand, it might have been decent - and had they fixed some minor problems (like the annoyingly clean costumes and settings), it may even have been great. It certainly had the potential. It's a pity it nuked the fridge... or should I say - flew the airship?",The Three Musketeers

Sometimes you feel as if the characters in the movie are a bit superhuman in what they can accomplish and they definitely have the quirky awkward one-liners that go along with it. If you are expecting a deep story with complex inter-character relationships, this is not the movie for you. Just go watch ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" to see the Musketeers in a slightly more serious role.

Nobody, not one single society on earth other than lowest common denominator USA would think this portrayal was worthy or funny or clever or entertaining.The acting was fair given the drivel they had to deal with, the sets and costumes were fantastic in an obvious sort of way, the CGI was equally obvious but good to watch. But the premise, plot and interpretation were just mindbogglingly awful. Oh for a remake with wit and the tiniest bit of sophistication! 2 out of 10 stars, one for the sets and costumes, one for some of the acting and one for the CGI, then minus one for the sheer dumbness of the rest of it.

It was like eating unsalted popcorn. You just eat and eat and at least you get bored. I was a bit disappointed in the end, but now I understand that the acting was just as the scenario itself - an easy one, which doesn't involve you emotionally and in my case,not even entertain. typical, banal jokes and methods of trying to make you laugh. I GUESS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM OF THIS MOVIES (and many many others that resamble it) is that the film directors and scenarists try to combine very many aspects and genres like LOVE, ADVENTURE, FIGHTS, SACRIFICE FOR AN AIM etc etc and it all ends up with movies like this: some wanna be epic characters, a few kisses, a few typical jokes + logan lerman trying to be cute and important and that's it: and awkward interpretation for THE THREE MUSKETEERSdon't waste your time , guys.",The Three Musketeers
208,SteampunkShinigami,Enjoyable... perhaps not always for the right reasons.,5,12 June 2015,"With the BBC's AMAZING Musketeers series having converted me to a Dumas addict, I decided to give this film a go, knowing full well that I would compare and contrast the two.To summarise, this film was amusing and enjoyable, (to the point where I sacrificed sleep to stay up and watch it), but mostly not for the right reasons.The trio themselves (Matthew Macfadyen as Athos, Ray Stevenson as Porthos and Luke Evans as Aramis) were so under-used that after I had finished watching, I almost found myself trying to remember what they did in it. Stevenson and Evans were enjoyable and engaging as their respective Musketeers, despite limited dialogue, and Macfadyen was quite good as Athos, (although Tom Burke's performance in BBC Musketeers is fairly definitive for me) but I felt I hardly saw them at all.Not what I expected from a film entitled 'The Three Musketeers'.In terms of the other cast members, Logan Lerman was not terrible, but far too 'all-American' to be d'Artagnan and his romance with Constance Bonacieux (played stiffly and uninspiringly by Gabriella Wilde) was underdeveloped and unbelievable. Freddie Fox and Juno Temple were watchable as the King and Queen. Christoph Waltz seemed to be simply there for the money. Orlando Bloom... well, if you enjoyed Eddie Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending (as I did, I will admit), I'm sure you will appreciate his entertainingly over the top Duke of Buckingham!Rochefort is my favourite non-Musketeer (especially since Marc Warren played him so brilliantly) and I enjoyed Mikkelsen's performance, but again, he suffered from poor writing. Saying 'Your Eminence' over and over again does nothing for character development.Milla Jovovich as Milady... just no. Far too much screen time, where she pouted and ran through explosions in slow motion. There was no sense of subtlety in her performance and, for a character who is supposed to be a spy, that probably would have improved it a great deal.James Cordon as Planchet made me cringe every time he appeared. Clearly intended to be the comic relief, the film was already hilariously corny without his terrible jokes continually popping up. Just bad, BAD writing.Costumes were really, really beautiful. Stunning use of German locations. CGI and green screen... not so much but it's bearable. Fight sequences were well choreographed. Fighting the Cardinal's Red Guards was particularly enjoyable. I didn't even REALLY mind the flying airships. Steampunk is a nice aesthetic and strangely didn't feel too out of place after a while.A thought... Captain Treville was just...absent? Entirely? The primary problem with this film was the lazy screen writing. ""Your horse took a dump in the road"", ""Haven't you ever heard of feelings?"", ""You should have apologised to my horse"" and ""You must go... so you can come back.."" being just some of the countless (slightly paraphrased) gems that lie buried behind layer after layer of CGI.Not to mention the ENDLESS ""Shut up Planchet""s like it was some sort of hilarious joke...? And another major problem was the lack of character development, due to lack of adequate screen time for... well, everyone.Would I ever watch it again? Yes. I am determined to get my family to watch it and laugh with me. It truly is a ridiculous romp that I did actually enjoy. I certainly didn't hate it.But I think I'll stick to the BBC adaptation.",The Three Musketeers

The fencing choreography was yes far fetched but well executed and what you'd expect from this type of movie (american) and protagonist (D'Artagnan). Vive la France ? Not so much.The biggest problem with this film is the casting. The musketeers and D'Artagnan are supposed to be french not American not British but FRENCH. This is an insult to the story and to purists like me. The villains are fine as Brits but I could not get passed the American and British accents of our beloved leads and principles characters. These 3 musketeers were also secondary in the story and quite frankly left me not caring for them because of their indifference and lack luster cavalierness. The king in this film was portrayed as as wimpy ambiguously femmish character with a British accent? Hollywood needs to wake up and cast appropriately for their foreign setting films and cast actors of proper ethnicity. The same needs to be said for an American actor who shall remain nameless playing an Englishman in a film about a figurative Persian prince. I can understand if talent scouts do not find the talent after really searching for it but if they don't find the local talent and the execs really want a star name attached then do everyone a favor and cast a name that can convincingly portray the proper accent (Iranian) or in this case French.

221,alek69,Is your book the same as mine?,6,23 December 2011,"I imagine, that they discovered one of the early drafts of this Dumas' book, which he probably wrote while being high on hashish, which was then the drug of choice, because not all that I saw was familiar and made sense.Right at the beginning of the movie we are not in France but in...Venice, where Athos, Porthos, Aramis and......Milady are breaking into Doge's Palace to steal plans to build a war airship. To be able to reach the secret place one has to get through an underground corridor. However, stepping on it's floor engages a secret mechanism, which in turn activates mechanical arrow throwers from behind the walls, which makes it impossible to cross that corridor alive ( I remember professor Jones having a similar problem). Well, they did cross it! Back in their hotel, the four of them merrily drink and proudly look at their booty, not suspecting, that Milady, who tenderly whispers to Athos ""I love you"" has secretly poured a sleeping potion into their drinks.My confusion about Milady then dissipates. Of course: she deceives them. She IS evil. When they are incapacitated, a man walks into the room and even though he is in shade, I know of course who he is. He is the most evil man in the whole France, the most cunning, the most power hungry.He is Jean Armand Du Plessis, Cardinal de Richelieu.But, but, but... hold my heart still, no!.. He is not... He is... The Duke of Buckingham!Milady and Buckingham? In cahoots?He needs those plans to build an air armada to attack France. ""Aha"" I think, ""that's how he wants to win his beloved Anne of Austria"". But no! He does not love her! He does not even know her! He just wants to win the bloody war! And the queen does not love him either. She is in love with her HUSBAND! Oy, I'm confused again!Back to France. A year later. The young d'Artagnan arrives in Paris. He meets Athos, Porthos and Aramis and, you know how it ends. They start dueling and those five doomed cardinal guards arrive to arrest them. But wait, from a side entrance a new group of guards is arriving. And another, and another. There is more and more of them! And the glorious fighting starts. Agent Smith and his clones, sorry, I meant the cardinal guards are attacking from all sides, from left, from right, in a circle, from above... Hmm...did I see that somewhere else too?After completely overwhelming the overwhelming enemy, the four, now friends, triumphantly walk through Paris. The king rewards them. The queen is happy. Richelieu is furious!He devises a plan to incriminate the queen. He calls for...Milady! Thank God. She works for him. I am not totally loosing my mind. She deceived Buckingham too and brings those stolen plans to the Cardinal. Something finally is the way it was supposed to be.But wait, the plan is different again!They are not bringing the necklace studs back from Buckingham! No, they have to steal them from the queen to bring them to Buckingham, so they can be stolen from Buckingham, who does not even know, that he has them. Oy Vey! I'm loosing my mind again.The Milady is entrusted with that mission. As she is about to enter the antechamber leading to the queen's secret cabinet where the necklace is hidden, she pauses knowingly. Then she blows a white powder into the air to expose... Yes, they are there... otherwise invisible... thin strings, like laser beams, hanging between the walls, that would, what... if touched, trigger an electronic alarm? Milady does not want to risk it. She somersaults through the air like Catherine Zeta-Jones in Entrapment, pirouettes, stretches in and out, under and over the obstacles, to so effortlessly reach for the necklace.Now they have to set their plan in motion.But I will not spoil for you the rest of this singular movie. You want to see how Dumas foresaw a ""Star Trek"" expedition? You want to see how the ""Pirates Of the Caribbean's"" ships battle originated? You want to see a great amount of swordplay? You want to see the blood curling Rochefort? You want to see what happens to Milady when she falls without a parachute from an air ship cruising at a Boeing 787 altitude?Well, if you do, go and see it yourself.Strangely, I promised myself to enjoy the movie and I enjoyed it.",The Three Musketeers
222,chorbz,Had more in common with the candy bar than the book...,1,24 September 2011,"I really thought that Twilight 4 would be the worst movie of the year but after seeing this one I don't think movies can get any worse. This movie proves that God exists only for their is no way that the worst screenplay and the worst acting got together and made this movie by coincidence, there had to be divine help.Not only does this movie not even remotely follow the book or any other movie it tries to spice up the failure of a movie that it is by having special effects that are so ridiculous they would make you laugh if you weren't in pain from realizing you paid to see this movie.Overall I would rather pay forty dollars to watch a censored version of Piranha 3D then get paid to see this movie again.",The Three Musketeers
223,on_the_money,More fun than I thought!,10,19 September 2011,"Surprisingly fun and action packed. And having just caught the Chris Odonnel version on cable this weekend, I've got to say that I'm glad they updated it! There is more humor, more action and it just looks bigger then any previous effort. Casting is rather interesting with a great number of solid actors playing the roles of the Musketeers themselves in MacFadyen, Luke Evans and Ray S. And Mads Mikkelsen is such a bad ass. I would have liked to seen more of him. Both Orlando and Milla are quite a lot of fun and definitely add a little bit of needed glamour and sex appeal. I'd recommend it 100% to anyone looking for a good fun film.",The Three Musketeers
224,mad-575-391154,"clichéd, campy, predictable - and very entertaining!",8,3 September 2011,"Paul W.S. Anderson's reboot of the Three Musketeers is one of those movies you should see with one expectation only: to be entertained without straining your braincells.It is an enjoyable adventure movie that never takes itself too serious, reminiscent of the first Pirates of the Caribbean film.The cast members seem to have enjoyed their parts as they display a mellow playfulness, with Orlando Bloom being the exception as he seems a little over-strained in his role as a bad guy. But even his helpless overacting can be overlooked in a movie that seems to be very self-aware about it's ultimate goal - to deliver two hours of mindless entertainment.Logan Lerman should be positively mentioned, because once you get over his haircut, he delivers a nice performance as the cocky, young hot-shot D'Artagnan, with a good sense of timing for his (mostly cheesy) onliners and a great agility in the fighting sequences.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie in 3D and look forward to a sequel. Recommended to anyone who appreciates silly entertainment with great visuals from time to time. See it in the cinema!",The Three Musketeers

The ambiance is espectacular , the final of the film remember resident evil afterlife.I have a good time viewing it,I hope that it have a second part'm looking forward for watch.

226,ShawnWallace,Screen Daily review,10,23 September 2011,"With their swords dusted off and old-fashioned swashbuckling adventure clearly in mind, The Three Musketeers make it back to the big screen in this engagingly colourful and action-packed romp, with director Paul W S Anderson displaying verve and panache in this rousing 3D re-booting of the much-filmed French classic novel. It is a well-crafted bit of mainstream entertainment that doesn't disappoint in terms of good old-fashioned swashbuckling fun. As he displayed in Resident Evil: Afterlife – the most recent of his hit zombie/sci-fi films, which star Milla Jovovich – Anderson has an appreciation and sure touch when it comes to 3D work, and it does help his delve into a colourful and dynamic movie-version of 17th century Europe as the Musketeers set about plenty of sword-fights, carousing and general derring-do. The Three Musketeers is a film that critics will find it easy to sneer at, but it is a well-crafted bit of mainstream entertainment that doesn't disappoint in terms of good old-fashioned swashbuckling fun.",The Three Musketeers
227,fvshkatie,A well dressed action turd,2,17 November 2012,"The ONLY thing that saves this is the swordplay and the gorgeous backdrops (which are mostly CGI in the palace--CHEATING). When Lady DiWinter strips down to her civvies and acts like a combination of Batgirl and Spiderman,it is just too much. Then Leonardo da Vinci's hot air balloon battleship shows up and shits out the Duke of Buckingham. Christ almighty, how much must the movie industry kiss the ass of 12 year old video gamers? Alexander Dumas is spinning in his grave-- it's one thing to take poetic or artistic license with material--after all this same movie has been made several times, differently each time. This movie had a budget that's apparent in the costuming and REAL backdrops. The actors aren't bad (except D'Artagnan sounds like an American smartass). This HAD the ingredients to be a good film but it fails miserably. It's just an overblown, gigantic floating turd of a movie! Unless you get off on ONLY sword action (and not enough of it is present) and great CGI, skip it.",The Three Musketeers
228,hollybanks12,Not as bad as people are saying,9,22 October 2011,"First off I would like to say that I loved the Three Musketeers, but did not expect much from this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. It had a great cast who, in the majority, pulled off their roles. The Women of the story, namely Milady and Constance, left a lot to be desired. Constance was bland and Milady was lacking the edge Michelle Pheiffer gave the role in a previous adaption. However, I found the king and queen surprisingly good. The King's character was greatly exaggerated, but it added comedy as he played the part perfectly. I expected nothing from Logan Lerman having seen Percy Jackson, but he played D' Artanan pretty well. While the Musketeers weren't particularly well developed, they had a limited time and the actors who played them played them very well. Regarding the airships, while it was different and more sword play would be preferable, they added an modern twist I found refreshing. One of the comments on an earlier review mentioned that the french had built an airship in only a few days, but in the movie it says that Milady had given them the blue prints ages ago. So while it was different and unbelievable, the logic was sound. Also, the sword fight on top of Notre Dame was incredibly cool. It's worth watching the film just for that. All in all I thought that the acting was good, there were comedic moments, and good special effects, a good movie in my opinion!",The Three Musketeers

Before you go to this movie, don't have high expectations. Don't think that this will be anything like the three musketeers that you know and love. Throw out your knowledge of history, your knowledge of the characters, your knowledge of the storyline...In fact, throw out everything you know about life. This movie was pure crack. The script itself was made to be that bad. You're supposed to raise your eye at uncharacteristic words coming out of your most beloved musketeer heroes and just let the SFX blow your mind as well as the blatant misuse of historical monuments. My friends and I really couldn't stop laughing. We found it amazingly entertaining and pure fun. If you're going to this thinking that you're going to go see something that is historically correct or is anything like Les Trois Mousquetaires, then you're going into this the wrong way.This is a movie that is supposed to be as fun as King Louis' wardrobe (watch this and you'll understand) so don't take it too seriously.

Before i saw this,i didn't care if i saw it or not. well now i wish i saved my time and money with it, and thats only $1.20! thats how much i hated this. FIRST-the fly ship was absolutely retarded. 2ND- this movie tries to be hilarious and charming. by the whole constance thing. i never even smirked the slightest bit at this movie.3RD- this movie had a 3 min. fighting scene in the first 20 min of the movie, then it goes on about love for almost the rest of the movie until the end, which is the part with the flying ship, so i wasn't thrilled.4TH- the king was the only interesting character, and he wasn't when that great. his weirdness and dumbness was funny, but not enough to make me smirk. don't waste ur time.",The Three Musketeers

Now with this great cast you would expect a great film right? Well that's exactly what it is! It has a decent amount of fighting in it, great acting and a bit of romance, that you know is there and that it's a thing and all but it's not in you're face, which I like. Now the only main problem I had with it, is that there was no blood, which is stupid because like I said they is a lot of fighting. So that annoyed me just a little but then again I had to remind myself that it's a 12A! so of course there wouldn't be any horrid stuff in it. I liked the film, I thought it was well-made with a great cast, I just would've liked it to have some blood in it, so maybe they should've made it a 15 instead! But there you go.

But every attempt at humor is completely dry, and the story is told in the worst way possible. Aside from the opening scene, everything added to the story in an attempt to make it different from the standard Three Musketeer plot is completely lame. And even Orlando Bloom acted like a rookie! I don't know how on earth this managed to get financed. If you want some real entertainment, watch the 1993 version, in which Tim Curry is the best evil Cardinal ever!",The Three Musketeers
234,DanaL7,Just Awful,1,21 October 2011,"As a parent, it really irks me when movies are peppered with just enough, but unnecessary, bad language to warrant a PG-13 rating. But not this time. Those parents who will not yet let their children see PG-13, you should be saying a prayer of thanks.....seriously.I had very low expectations of this movie when I went and as it turns out, I was quite the optimist. The acting was silly, but to be fair, they didn't have anything to work with that could possibly have been salvageable. The movie gave silly nods to Assassin's Creed, Raider's of the Lost Ark, anything with Jackie Chan, Mission Impossible, The Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean, just to name a few. The airship. They built it in a week...amazing! Incredibly, these Musketeers not only intuitively knew how to fly this brand spanking new invention, they also learned how to pick up a carriage in mid-flight! Just when I swallowed this stupidity of the airship...OMG....there's another one and it's cannonball proof....they bounce right off!! And just when you think you've safely landed after plummeting off Mount Absurd, you are shoved face first into the Abyss of Ludicrous......here comes a whole armada of airships...probably cannonball proof....may as well be.Obviously, I hated this movie. They had a great opportunity to have it a little campy while telling a good story. All that being said, the kids are doing to love it.

The film had all the elements of a fun successful family film: witty dialogue, enticing action scenes, charming cast, and a message of moral character. It was an entertaining film that kept me and my guest captivated; we laughed, winced, and rooted for D'artagnan and the Musketeers. The crowd in the theater seemed to have the same experience as I did, eruptions of laughter filled the cinema and upon leaving the theater overheard good feedback from the film. The majority of the audience comprised of families. I spoke to my best friend in New York who had also gone out to see the film with her friends on opening night and she thoroughly enjoyed it and said that the audience seemed to really like it as well. I have to admit though that there was not much that I heard about the movie. In the last month or so the only advertising I had seen on 3M was a billboard by my house and 2 commercials. This is also something I've been hearing from a lot of people that they just did not know the film was coming out. Overall, It was a great entertaining film that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the length of the film.",The Three Musketeers

237,max-tvs,"Very Enjoyable, Pure Entertainment",10,16 November 2011,"After seeing this film twice I can honestly say that you would be hard pressed to find something more entertaining in 2011. The movie contains action that rivals Micheal Bay films mixed with a swashbuckling tongue and cheek mood in order to create a quite unique and amazing action movie. Whilst at some points the dialogue and acting can feel awkward the visuals in this movie a nothing short of stunning. That is not to say it's something of Zack Snyder type film (300, Watchmen and Sucker Punch) as this film actually has likable characters that aren't simply one dimensional caricatures. The set pieces, costume and setting have been carefully crafted allowing you the luxury of suspending your sense of disbelief in even the most ridiculous scenes. 3D cinema has had some major issues since day one. The Three Musketeers' 3D isn't free from problems but it is definitely head and shoulders above anything else to date. In my opinion The Three Musketeers is the first movie where 3D is actually beneficial to the experience. This is not a film were you should expect swords to pop out on screen screen and stab you in the face,but a film that using 3D technology adds depth and is more immersive. Needless to say this is an exceptionally fun movie which a couple difficulties in the script and some misplaced American accents can't ruin. This movie does not take itself too seriously and nor should you. Definitely don't miss this one! Enjoy",The Three Musketeers
238,oluwaseyi,Critique,2,7 December 2011,"It is very easy in united states particularly to make movies which have the components of a masterpiece without the core essence of a truly magnificent movie. A movie is a combination of so many factors, some of which are a bit easier to get right, such as costumes, set etc. while others require true gift. These latter include the accuracy and subtle nuances of credible dialogue, direction as it covers poses, angles and so much more.You can have ll the clothes and other trappings of royalty but if you were not born as one in the times of Queen Elizabeth I for instance, you really cannot act the part.The movie was alright. It was not, on the same level as The Rise of the Planet of the Apes, The Transformers: The Dark Side of the Moon or Super 8. It was of some note. The filming and treatment of Milla Jovovich in it ruined it considerably. As Milady, it was a crime in fashion for her to have worn hats with those dresses. If I was God, I would re-create the person responsible for that decision, knowing i must have done something wrong in creating him or her;.Then Milla is a peculiar body, look and presence. Her look is so unique and distinct that she requires very carefully tailored roles or else the entire movie will have dispersed essence. That was the case with Fifth Element - she worked in it. I just saw in Faces in the Crowd and I have never seen a worse movie. In Resident Evil, if the movie was a commercial success to any extent, it only goes to show that it is not everyone who sees a movie has a developed and refined palette for beauty, coherence and essence in movies.It's so bad now that I would be wary to want to see her in another movie.",The Three Musketeers

Christoph Waltz was a more nuanced Richelieu than Charlton Heston. I saw my first 3 musketeer film over 60 years ago. This seems to be among the best,for my money.

This is lowest point in the history of filmmaking.. Without fantasy, without any depth..(a 3d-movie without depth :-)) Even the jokes are not funny.. It feels like watching a bad stunt report.. Choreography of the fights is funny and silly in a bad way. Music is so typical that is irritating, Actors look and act like puppets (mostly because the screenplay is so terrible -it hurts!!) And what about director ? Mostly the movie was filmed on impressive locations... believe me - It would be better if they created the whole movie with computer (the actors, the sets, the music..)

Clearly massively influenced by the Hawkmoon Champion Eternal books from Mr Moorcock....masks, flamethrowers, hand held crossbows, airships and England as the big bad empire....with the Duke of Buckingham in the role of Baron Meliadius... in the absence of a genuine Moorcock film (which is a complete oversight - come on Hollywood!)...this is a great vehicle for imagining what might be if the 'real' Moorcock world was bought to life in film!",The Three Musketeers
243,gsingh-317-114060,"Absolute garbage, skip this one at all cost",1,15 March 2012,"First off I want to start by saying that i have never posted a review on IMDb before as no movie how bad it is has compelled me to do so. But recently these so called Hollywood blockbusters have left me with no choice. So lets come to this movie now. First off who did the casting for this movie and who wrote the script if you can call it a script. I guess the plan in the boardroom was lets take good actors like Chris Waltz, Mads Mikkelson, Ray Stevenson and even Luke Evans. All these actors except Luke Evans I love dearly. But in this movie all the director and producer did was under-use the best actors in the movie and instead give all the screen time to Mila and Logan. I personally enjoy watching Mila in Resident Evil series but here she was just unnecessary. And this kid Logan, who calls him an actor, i am furious that he got paid to do this role so poorly. I am a business grad so I work better in explaining things in points. So i will just make a list of what I felt was wrong with this movie; here it goes: The three musketeers, um mm I mean the four musketeers I guess - 1) Lets teach all the teenage kids to fight and join some sort of army or gang. Also send them to the big city to pick fights with anyone who insults their horse. There is no honour in doing anything else but killing another human being. I guess being a scholar, inventor and all that is just a waste, be a killer thats where all the glory and Honor is.2) Lets hire a bunch of exceptional actors and under-use them through the whole movie and just use their faces on the posters to sell the movie.3) A 20 year old kid who is trained by his father can beat down 20 cardinal guards all by himself while the brave three musketeers watch and laugh in surprise.4) If you kill the cardinal guards in the streets of France, then the public cheers and rejoices for you and calls you a hero openly.5) Lets use Da Vinci's name for the sake of scientific inventions and get away with inventing a flying elephant for crying out loud.6) lets offer no character development in any dimension but still make the movie in 3 dimension for the people to enjoy.7) Remember if a girl kisses you, then you must go to England, steal the Diamonds, bring them back to France all in 5 days. I suppose water ships used to sail really fast during those times.8) If you are the villain and you have to stop the hero from bringing the diamonds back to France, then do not shoot the airship down and destroy the evidence but instead offer them a trade for the captive girl.9) Lets get the heroes who have seen an airship for the first time in their lives fly an airship later on in the movie with no real training what so ever.10) Lets get Mila to kill 5-6 skilled guards in a sword fight and pull off a heist but yet still accept defeat in front of 4 musketeers because she is such a petite woman with no strength.11) Lets throw Mila from the airship thousands of miles down to ocean and still have her survive the ordeal because first you cant kill Mila no matter what and second because if you fall from the height of thousand miles into water, it does not hurt as water breaks your fall.I can continue on with many other rants about the movie but I will stop here. My only request is to Mr. Mikkelson and Christopher Waltz is that I know it takes money to pay the bills but please do read the script before you actually sign a movie. I suggest everyone who reads this review to avoid this movie completely. Trust me you wont miss much",The Three Musketeers
244,chris-aldridge84,Worst Musketeers Movie Ever!,1,27 March 2012,"So the other week I decided to watch the new version of the Three Musketeers because I have always liked the Musketeers. It was, to be frank, utterly deplorable, compared the story and the movies prior. I couldn't even finish it. For one, somethings in it were highly unrealistic for the time period. Flying technology did not exist, nor were people able to leap through the air and dodge things like in the Matrix. The fighting scenes were unrealistic whereas in the original version, the fights seemed more real and as if they could have happened. The Uniforms of the Musketeers and especially the Cardinal's Men were highly inaccurate and looked more like something out of a fairytale. In the 1993 Three Musketeers and The Man in the Iron Mask, although King Louis is arrogant and spoiled, he is a strong leader. In the new version, King Louis seems more like a child who wants to play dress up. In conclusion, I wouldn't give this movie a half star rating. Throw it out. The originals are incredibly better.",The Three Musketeers
245,Nikitastik,All in good fun,8,31 March 2012,"While I wholeheartedly agree with everyone who complains that this adaptation bears almost no resemblance to Dumas' classic, I must also respectfully disagree about the complaints of it being an utter waste of time. I am a die-hard Musketeers fan. Read the book, fell in love, watched nearly every movie adaptation, still in love. That being said, I hold no illusions on the fact that this movie was NOT meant to resemble the original novel further than names and basic plot. They were going for something different here. They wanted a franchise like The Pirates movies, for one. They also, frankly, wanted to make money. I'm sorry, but most younger people (not all) would be yawning themselves silly if they were to watch an exact adaptation of the novel. A few people would be pleased, but i am telling you that, although this didn't do very well in the box office, a more accurate version would have done infinitely worse. I think they have something excellent here. It's fun, it's quirky, it has the classic plot line but with a slew of fresh outlooks and twists that definitely set it apart from all of the other versions out there. I love the sci fi outlook and the steam-punk filming. It may not be period correct, but really how many things are now days? And really, who cares? Its fun, its interesting. Go with it. It wasn't meant to be a historical movie they show in history classes. It's meant for entertainment value only. Orlando Bloom really shined in this movie! He played a quirky, fun, masterful enemy and I think if they continue in the direction they are headed he will make a fabulous villain. I've never been a fan of him, but my outlook is changed. Logan Lerman was fantastic as well. I was worried when I saw him casted, but he was really great and added depth to his character. My complaints (believe it or not): Milady. Really, her whole character almost. She was a little too much for me in this. I think she just got way too much screen time and altogether detracted from the character development of the Musketeers themselves. The king. The poor guy.. I can't stand how petulant he is in this movie. It made me almost start rooting for the bad guys, because really the cardinal would make a better ruler than this childish, air-headed kid. He was way overdone I think. The Musketeers. I loved who they chose and they would have really shined had they been given the screen time to so. Alas, Milady and the other bad guys stole all of the screen time which could have been used to develop these amazing, noble men. Don't get me wrong, I love a good villain as much as the next girl, but it was hard to put depth in the words ""all for one and one for all"" when the script made the villains more interesting than the heroes. The result was some very one dimensional characters. That was the worst part for me because Athos, Porthos, and Aramis ARE the Three Musketeers. They needed a bit more love, I think. All in all, I loved it and hope they do continue to make the movies.",The Three Musketeers

The Three Musketeers and D'Artagnan were great! Great fighting and great humor. I would really like to see a sequel. Lastly, the costumes were AMAZING! The dresses were so bright and colorful.

247,shivanawolf,Don't they test screen movies anymore?,3,14 May 2012,I could handle some of the *flash* if only it delivers the *bang*Simply put.. this movie lacks1. Comedic Timing (Even cliché humour can be saved with good timing)2. Engaging Plot (The characters themselves seem to lack the enthusiasm)Note: When 10 year old children start pointing out plot flaws.. you know a movie has problems.3. Developed Characters. Nothing seems to differentiate between any of the musketeers. There is no sense of personal goals/dreams/fears.I was simply left scratching my head at the end of this movie. I just don't understand why they don't test screen movies anymore.,The Three Musketeers
248,kknightbridge,Hollywood gone mad,3,2 September 2012,"I was so disappointed with this movie that I actually went to the trouble to sign up to write a review. It was completely overdone (Hollywood-ised) from beginning to end-some scenes were just not credible. The acting was also overdone.D'Artangian is supposed to be cocky but come across more like a know-it-all, modern teenager. The best actor was the King who had some great lines but not many of them...The Queen also had some great put-downs for the Cardinal. The original movie was also quite funny in places which this movie lost.The characters are not really developed and it's actually quite hard to feel any warmth for the three musketeers let alone the snotty D'Artangian.",The Three Musketeers
249,mark2712-546-303322,rubbish,1,4 December 2012,The three musketeers and modern - i was looking forward to watching it. But like many recent films no regard is made to language - actors no longer bother to try to have the correct accent.....this film is the mother of all crap accents....there are none - it is a french film and no attempt to have a french accent - my god every time Dartagnon spoke it grated inside me...so so American and ruining the film totally - i gave up watching it as i could not listen to the American accent any more - i am English and of course hate the french but this was too far - for gods sake Hollywood make an effort !! Look at Wallace - at least he tried to have a Scottish accent !,The Three Musketeers
250,bazfran23,Really Enjoyed,8,28 July 2021,"I had just read Dumas book so was interested to see how the film interpreted it, this is a fantasy film based on the book it does retain each musketeers personality., it adds characters and also deletes characters but does in the main keep to the narrative BUT it's a fantasy film so if you want a verbatim version of the book then forget it. I watched the trailer and realised straight away but Gave it a go and I really enjoyed it, last film in bed and didn't fall asleep.Note:- I gave it 8 stars it's not really worth that just gave it that to raise it's raiting, I mark my films out of 5 and gave it 3.",The Three Musketeers
251,fontfunkfactory,?,1,5 February 2012,"This movie didn't know what it wanted to be. It was very confused. It had some good points but the flaws just overtook the movie. I guess there has been to many versions of the three musketeers this one tried to stand out in all kinds of directions. You would think that Christoph Waltz would have been a good pick as the cardinal. I thought he would portrait him sleazy and evil. He was more of a plotting old man without fangs. Milla played her role very sexy and that was entertaining.... but would have fitted better in a soft-core porno-movie. Orlando Bloom came across as ... well just plain weird. I also thought that D'artagnan got way to much attention in this movie , it made the musketeer's seem more like bystanders. Anyway its pointless to sit here and give this movie more time.",The Three Musketeers
252,bjet-714-290795,Dumas simplified to a graphic novel? Teens need it.,8,25 December 2020,"Most of teenagers in 21 century will not have time or energy to read the book.
This film will fill the gap and at least introduce the well known characters.
It might help some smart kids to discover the book and enjoy it.
The rest - deserve the movie as is.
And, for its purpose, the film is done really well.",The Three Musketeers
253,didemgokcebel,Seen it about 30 times can watch it another 10. Admirable creativity despite it's time confusion.,10,29 April 2020,"I believe it is one of the most harshly rated movies of all time. Although the timeline does not match, the entertainment level was over the clouds. There should be a generation crisis on this movie because evidently most of the people are not as open minded to accept the adaptation is made for a great cause. It is a breathtaking movie with great acting from a fantastic cast. Haters can continue to hate. However, it is very unfair to compare this movie with the 1993 version. Especially, the time has brought so many wonders and Anderson is a great director to compliment these changes. I felt the urge to comment here as the appreciation was so disappointing and I was so devastated to realise because of these haters, I would not be able to watch another release of my favourite movie.My advice to all who did not find what they were looking for: Try to think about the new generations perspective and re-watch it. Also, I have read painful comments about the quotes of this movie. I think they were fantastic with all the comebacks and them being so straight to the point.",The Three Musketeers
254,nikon-fx,Great visuals but script leaves a lot to be desired,4,6 November 2011,"The good: very nice costumes, spectacular decors, and generally good visual effects. The young king was played very well by Freddy Fox and generally scenes involving him were good/funny.The bad: the script is all over the place. There are so many plot holes and unbelievable situations that I simply couldn't ignore them anymore. Mila Jovovich was horribly miscast in this movie. She simply is unable to deliver the finesse and style required for her role. Her voice does not fit at all and is imprecise, lacking proper pronunciation, especially when compared to the rest of the cast. Mads Mikkelsen was not nearly evil enough, to me it seemed he underperformed. The movie in general lacked drama, resulting in boring characters.The mediocre: the 3D effects were useless, but didn't annoy me. It looked like some scenes were not originally shot in 3D but I could be mistaken.I felt that the movie didn't live up to it's potential. If you are able to ignore the crazy physics and plot holes it is an entertaining movie.",The Three Musketeers
255,nick-71239,Spoiler alert! Terrible movie!,1,17 June 2016,"This is a disappointingly weak movie.It tries to cash in on the ""Three Musketeers"" name.It is painful to watch like nails scratching a blackboard.In parts surreal, it lacks continuity and flow.It diverges from the script in a nonsensical and non sequitur fashion.What a great cast, what great special effects, what great cinematography, what a great waste.An alternative title would be ""Three Musketeers trip on LSD"" In summary not close and no cigar.Worst of all it finishes with a queue for a sequel. Aargh.Alexander Dumas must be rolling in his grave.",The Three Musketeers
256,danielmooncalf,Absolute crap.,2,5 November 2011,"Rent/download the 20 year old Disney one, instead.Who read this script and thought it was worth making? It opens with Athos assassinating a guard, as they break into some weird Steampunkish Davinci museum. Then some woman in full court dress somehow outruns projectile traps, and is able to help the musketeers steal some plans for a super weapon. It's a stupid scene, and it only gets worse from there.D'Artagnan is an ugly little asshole. The special effects are garbage. It was like watching a little kid play a bad video game. Porthos was the only entertaining one, but would you dig through dog poop to find an unwrapped Hershey's kiss? If you would, then you should watch this movie.",The Three Musketeers
257,rudgeb,One of the worst interpretations of a good story I've seen,1,10 October 2020,Given the cast and the source material this film falls very short of expectations. I assumed it would be a dumbed down action packed version of the film but the acting is poor and the action out of place. The characters are one dimensional and not engaging to watch. The tempo of the film doesn't flow and an hour into the film it hasn't really got going. Just watch the 70's classic instead.,The Three Musketeers
258,lamaireniels,complicated? Absolutely yes!,7,30 October 2017,"A really nice movie. Paul W.S. Anderson has made a chaotic world of it: constant fighting, war, action, ... that was still intriguing me. Normally I have a dislike of historical movies, but this movie is an exception (many versions have already been made of '' the 3 musketeers ''. The last filming was in 2011, the film we're discussing now). The author always warns when it becomes too elongated, the scene is swapped or the situation changes, making it fascinating. so initially I found the movie moderate.The film is about the fact that the musketeers must win the plan for the warship, which they can then use against the enemy. They are also successful, but there is betrayal in the game, causing the plans to fall into bad hands. They were thrown down until a boy from Gascony also wanted to become musketeer. He gave them courage again. In addition, they avoid a war.I'm sorry that it takes a long time for you to be in the story. In that regard, the author should do better. You can also observe that there are many transitions of scenes and places, which you do not necessarily see a connection between those transitions. At last if you saw them fighting, it became very annoying and boring in the long run. But, as I said, the author can keep it interesting.It is a must for people who are interested in history and culture. Of course, you can always watch movies and you do not care what kind of genre. This movie is not really tailored to me because I prefer horror, action, comedy and fantasy in my movie. Therefore I give a 3.5 / 5. My opinion about the movie does not change: it remains a moderate movie.",The Three Musketeers
259,pmt008,Very enjoyable,8,18 October 2011,"***Warning - Spoilers***For me, the epitome of Three Musketeer films were the ones made with Oliver Reed and Michael York. They gave a good show of the sort of world it is set in, had good sword fights and abounded with comedy. Those films are a clear 10 for me.In this film I believe that the aim was to recreate a similar feel the Reed and York films. And, for the most part, I think they did a very good job. As has been remarked elsewhere, there was absolutely no need for ""air ships"" but aside from that and the desire of the director to get his wife to do some completely unrealistic and unbefitting action sequences (as is also mentioned elsewhere) I was very impressed. Although it escapes my mind as to exactly what it was, there was definitely 1 laugh-out-loud moment and some very good moments of swordplay. Sadly the swordplay, which is the staple diet for most musketeer film fans, was not as prevalent as it perhaps should have been, particularly in the finale. Sure, there was the final duel between Rochefort and D'Artagnan but that was sadly lacking for what was supposed to be the battle between the 2 greatest swordsmen in all of France. And on the subject of the fight, there was absolutely no reason to kill off Rochefort! But I really enjoyed the action as a whole, thought that the story was a pretty good version of the original and found Orlando Bloom a revelation as a bad guy. Playing a puffed-up, arrogant aristocrat really suited him and he seemed to love the role! The ending clearly points to at least 1 more film, which I hope will include more swordplay and less airships, but I think we can be optimistic of more good to come from the musketeers!",The Three Musketeers
260,clayjardine,Fun Movie To Watch,7,11 May 2018,"It's not your traditional Three Musketeer's story, but I think it was a creative take on it. I can see why some people wouldn't like the changes, but I feel like they help to keep the story entertaining.Some of the pacing in the film is weird and the actions of some characters could seem a little humorous, but overall it's a fun movie that should be entertaining to those who just want something to take them out of the real world.",The Three Musketeers
