0,Leofwine_draca,One of the best films of the decade,10,11 July 2016,"Joel Schumacher's satire of modern America is just as fresh now as when it first came out. This thriller packs a real punch, telling the story of anti-hero William Foster, who snaps one day while sitting in a traffic jam (echoing the early Stephen king novella ROADWORK) and proceeds to go on a rampage across L. A. It works as a general thriller, with plenty of humour and action set pieces (I enjoyed it when watching as a kid) but at its heart it's a dark, despairing look at the troubles facing today's society. Schumacher is gutsy enough to criticise the integration (or not) into society of non-Americans; gang culture; fast food establishments; customer service; the growth of Neo-Nazism in the US; the nuclear family; marriage breakdown and divorce; the rich/poor divide, and plenty more besides. Lashings of the blackest comedy imaginable abound and despite elements of sentimentality here and there, this remains a striking, powerful and original masterpiece.It also helps that the film stars two actors playing at the top of their game. Michael Douglas has never been better in his subtle, stony-faced performance of a guy driven to the brink (and beyond); opposite him, playing an aged cop hot on his heels, is Robert Duvall. Duvall is one of those character actors never really given a chance to shine that often but shine he does here. The cop sub-plot could have been boring with somebody else in the role but Duvall gives this film its human heart and I think it's also his best turn. Still a great movie and one that seemingly becomes more potent and more realistic as time passes. The question you'll come away with afterwards is, undoubtedly...are you economically viable?",Falling Down
1,SnoopyStyle,deliberately annoying movie,6,1 September 2015,"A driver (Michael Douglas) is stuck in a traffic jam. In frustration, he walks away from his car with license plate D-Fens. LAPD Robbery Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) starts his last day and helps push the car to the side. His wife (Tuesday Weld) is struggling with issues. D-Fens has a confrontation with convenience store owner Lee who gives a statement to Prendergast. D-Fens is mad and going home to see his kid. His ex-wife Beth (Barbara Hershey) has a restraining order against him.Joel Schumacher has no subtlety in this movie and that's the point. This is the old white guy yelling at the black kids to stay off his lawn. Then he snaps and shots one of them. Everything is skewed to annoy the audience so that they can feel for D-Fens. Literally, everything character and everything situation is geared towards to utterly annoying. Prendergast is the opposite of D-Fens. He faces frustrations of his own but he handles it anyways. This is a deliberately annoying movie.",Falling Down
2,claudio_carvalho,One of the Greatest Social Criticisms of Our Contemporary Way of Life,7,5 July 2015,"On the day of his daughter's birthday, William ""D-Fens"" Foster (Michael Douglas) is trying to get home of his estranged ex-wife to see her daughter. He has a breakdown and leaves his car in a traffic jam in Los Angeles and decides to walk. Then he goes to a convenience store and tries to get some changes for a phone call but the Korean owner does not change his money. The unstable William breaks apart the shop with a baseball bat and goes to an isolated place to drink a coke. Two gangsters threaten him and he reacts hitting them with the bat. William continues walking and stops at a phone booth. The gangsters hunt him down with their gang and shoot him but crash their car. William goes nuts and takes their gym bag with weapons proceeding in his journey of rage against injustice. Meanwhile Sergeant Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall) that is working on his last day before retirement is following the wave of crimes and believes that the responsible is the same man but the other detectives do not pay attention to him.""Falling Down"" is a movie with a story that is one of the greatest social criticisms of our contemporary way of life. The character William Foster has a typical day in a big city, with traffic jams, intolerance, violence, unemployment, citizen economically inviable, homeless, but he is on the edge of his existence and just wants to see his daughter on her birthday. However, it is a wrong day for him. The plot is sad and without hope but realistic. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Um Dia de Fúria"" (""One Day of Rage"")",Falling Down
3,kosmasp,Upside aka O-Fens,9,3 June 2020,"Mostly people remember this for the powerhouse performance Michael Douglas gives us. But one cannot overlook the performance Robert Duvall is sharing! This is elemental and it is very important to balance the D-Fens character. There are so many layers, so many social commentary stabs, that it is hard to break them all down. It is made for repeat viewing for sure.So many memorable scenes and a sometimes missunderstood look on a character. He's crazy and cannot be contained. Glorifying him would be the wrong thing to do. Robert Duvall is our moral compass and hopefully if you watch or re-watch it like I did, you'll see it. Scarface was also a grand performance (or performances if you take the 30s movie into account), but wasn't meant to be our hero. So while we can feel with a character that just has enough already ... it does not mean this is meant to be a formula on how to do things ... quite the opposite should be the effect",Falling Down
4,classicsoncall,"""I'm just standing up for my rights as a consumer.""",7,5 February 2021,"If this film was relevant back in 1993, imagine how much more so one can relate to it in 2021 as I write this. Especially with the country at pretty much an even 50-50 divide, and politicians of both sides suggesting aggression against each other. Even though this wasn't made as a political film, virtually everything today is becoming politicized in one way or another, eventually resulting in the type of frustration William Foster/Mr. D-Fens (Michael Douglas) gives vent to as he encounters traffic jams, territorial gangs, an uncooperative shopkeeper, and an ex-wife who won't give him the time of day. At times it's difficult not to root for the guy as he swings for the fences with his baseball bat, but at the same time, it's an uncomfortable feeling to see so much pain and destruction that results from his pique of anger. The counterpoint to the story is the steadying influence of Robert Duvall's character, a desk cop who takes to the streets for his last day on the job, hoping to be relevant by apprehending the lunatic who's causing havoc throughout a small section of the city. When they eventually meet, it becomes a clash of wills to determine an outcome with limited options. Contrast this film with a present day take on the everyday frustrations that leads one to lose all control with the recently released ""Unhinged"" starring Russell Crowe. It's much more aggressive and violent than this one, with a similar resolution that could only go one way.",Falling Down
5,lee_eisenberg,probably could happen,9,5 October 2006,"Personally, I'm surprised that what gets portrayed in ""Falling Down"" doesn't happen more often. Michael Douglas plays an unemployed defense worker who one day flips out while caught in a traffic jam and goes on a rampage against society. Literally everywhere that he goes, he finds something to get angry about. When I watched the movie, I half wanted to root for him, but at the same time got a little unnerved by some of the things that he did.But overall, this movie looks at the degenerated state of our society. Even if you think that he's lost his mind, you have to agree with his complaints...at least most of them. Also starring Robert Duvall, Barbara Hershey, Tuesday Weld, Rachel Ticotin and Frederic Forrest.Just how much money are we paying South Korea?",Falling Down
6,jboothmillard,Falling Down,9,28 February 2007,"From Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm award nominated director Joel Shumacher (Batman Forever, Phone Booth), this is a great satire thriller. It is one of the hottest days in America, and William 'D-Fens' Foster (a superb Michael Douglas) is stuck in traffic, he decides to get out and leave his car behind. After that, it just gets worse, he has a massive temper and is not afraid to act on the ""injustices"" that prevent him from getting his own way, or getting ""home"". Along the way he goes mad about a coke can price from a Korean shopkeeper, attacks black men who say he is on their patch, gets a gun out at a burger bar who ended breakfast, murders a Nazi Surplus Store Owner (Frederic Forrest) who at first helps him, fools a bum, shoots a phone booth, and threatens too many people's lives. Meanwhile, Detective Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall) was originally retiring, but as more reports come in about Foster's violent behaviour, he feels it is his job to catch him. Oh, and Foster's main purpose is to get to the house of Elizabeth 'Beth' Travino (Beaches' Barbara Hershey), his ex-wife, with his daughter whose having her birthday. Also starring Tuesday Weld as Amanda Prendergast and Total Recall's Rachel Ticotin as Detective Sandra Torres. I can agree with the critics it loses some speed towards the end, but this is only a tiny problem. This is what I like to refer to as the nut-case film, like Fatal Attraction, One Hour Photo and Misery, and this is another fantastic example. Michael Douglas was number 100 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very, very good!",Falling Down
7,ccthemovieman-1,Just Fast-Forward To The Good Spots,7,12 March 2006,"I found this movie one of two extremes: I either loved a particularly scene or hated it. When Michael Douglas was on screen running into various people, it was fascinating and extremely entertaining. He expressed a number of hostile feelings people have but don't verbalize them or act them out., as Douglas does in this film. Some of them are funny and very memorable. Some are politically correct; some are not. Frederick Forest, who plays the Nazi, is the wildest of them all and cracks me up every time I see his whacked-out persona.The rest of the film is nothing but annoying and stupid. Too bad because a couple of actors I like are in those scenes but they are so annoying I couldn't watch them after two viewings of this film (Tuesday Weld and Robert Duvall). I just fast-forward through those soapy, irritating parts. After a handful of looks over a period of a decade, I just stopped the watching the movie entirely, trading in the DVD. However, I had fun going along for the ride with 'D-fens' a few times. This has to be one of Douglas' more memorable roles, even though the film is not among his best.",Falling Down
8,rmax304823,What happens when you love not wisely but too well.,7,27 November 2008,"Above-average tale of a defense plant engineer (Michael Douglas) who loses everything -- his job, his car, his dignity, his temper, his wife, his daughter, his life. We first see him stuck in a Los Angeles traffic jam, bumper to bumper, sweating and fretting, until he walks away from his stalled car and begins to walk ""home"" -- that is, where his divorced wife (Barbara Hershey) and his young daughter live.Some home. (Like that in the John Cheever short story, ""The Swimmer,"" it's a fantasy.) As he trudges along in his white shirt, tie, and unhip eyeglasses, he pauses from time to time to phone his wife and tell her he's on his way, because it's his daughter's birthday.""I know it's Adel's birthday -- what do you want?"", she tells him, adding, ""I'll call the police if I have to."" Meanwhile, Douglas runs into all kinds of obstacles. A street-wise Korean shopkeeper wants to charge him eighty-five cents for a can of Coke (a big laugh, as of this date) and Douglas blows his cork, smashing some merchandise and walking off with the owner's sawed-off baseball bat.Things get worse. He crosses paths with some cholos who demand his money and produce a weapon that, when I was a teenager, was widely known as a ""Portugese"" knife. But he clobbers them with his bat and, later, winds up with a gym bag full of their pistols and automatic weapons. Douglas may be a fruitcake but everyone else is mean too. The confrontations continue and the police, represented by Robert Duvall and Rachel Ticotin, finally get wise to him and track him to the Santa Monica pier where he is more or less holding his wife and child hostage. When Duvall tries to place him under arrest, Douglas asks wonderingly, ""I'm the bad guy?"" Whatever other things he's lost, self-justification isn't one of them.From what I'd heard, I hadn't expected much of this film -- another revenge story, along the lines of ""Death Wish"". But it's actually fairly complex, despite some clumsy moment and many implausibilities. The film's chief weakness is that, though Douglas is clearly around the bend, everybody who gets a taste of his anger somehow has asked for it. The offense can be major -- trying to gun him down on the street -- or minor -- refusing to serve him from the breakfast menu at a burger joint after eleven thirty.And I don't know if the writer, Ebbe Rowe Smith, intended it this way but both Douglas's ex-wife and Duvall's current wife, played by Tuesday Weld, are both bitches in their different ways. When Douglas has called to say he's on his way home, despite the restraining order, Hershey calls the police and informs them that he has ""a tendency towards violence."" (He pounded on the door after midnight.) The police ask her if he struck his daughter. No. ""Did he -- strike you?"" ""Not exactly. I didn't want to wait until he got around to it. He COULD -- I think."" The cop nods knowingly and makes a note. Abusive husband. That's a cheap, stereotypical shot. Douglas has a restraining order against him because he's suspected of perhaps some day possibly committing a violent act within his family. Kind of a unilateral preemptive move on Hershey's part.Duvall's wife, Tuesday Weld, is also a thoroughly formulaic figure -- whining, narcissistic, demanding, hypochondriacal, the clear wearer of the pants in the family. Wardrobe and make up have turned her into an ill-groomed slob, but it would have been truer to the character (Duvall: ""She lost her beauty."") if she had done her desperate best to look good. The two wives may be manipulative but Duvall's partner, Rachel Ticotin, comes off as an admirable figure. Not dazzlingly gorgeous, she nevertheless has good, strong features arranged in an uncontrived manner. And she gives a good performance. So does Lois Smith in the small part of Douglas' uncomprehending mother. Some of the bit parts are so poorly done, they're an embarrassment to watch. Douglas himself can't be considered a wildly expressive performer but he successfully suggests the kind of pressure one might find behind a zit that's about to pop. Robert Duvall has given some magisterial performances early in his career -- M*A*S*H and The Godfather among them -- but here rather walks through the part with a lot of pointless or possibly ironic chuckles.Weaknesses aside, Douglas's character is complicated enough to grip us and the milieu of Los Angeles is captured in all its local color, which varies from indifference to outrage.",Falling Down
9,Tweekums,The day an ordinary man couldn't take it any more,9,1 June 2016,"It is the hottest day of the year in Los Angeles and the freeway is jammed solid and William Foster has reached breaking point. He abandons his car and heads into a shop and asks for change so he can phone his young daughter on her birthday. The Korean shopkeeper says he won't give change unless he buys something. Unhappy with the prices Foster rages at the man who grabs a sawn off baseball bat; Foster disarms him then smashes some of the produce before buying a drink. Foster then sits down to consume his drink on some waste ground and is confronted by a couple of gang members; he hits out with the bat and takes a butterfly knife one of them dropped. Later the gang track him down and try to shoot him; not only do they completely miss him, they crash their car. Foster walks up to the vehicle and takes a bag full of guns. Things quickly escalate as he pulls out a submachinegun at a fast food restaurant, confronts a neo-Nazi storekeeper and rages at a pair of golfers. All the time heading towards his estranged wife in Venice Beach.While all this is going on Sgt Martin Prendergast is on his last day at work as an LAPD robbery detective; it should be an easy day but as news of Foster's activities start to come in he realises that they are the work of one man; the man whose car Prendergast helped push off the freeway on the way to work. Remembering the distinctive 'D-Fens' registration he identifies Forster and learns that he is a defence worker who had recently been made redundant; it is also abundantly clear that he has anger issues; Prendergast is determined to stop him before he can harm his family.This film can be looked on as a thriller, a very black comedy or even as a social commentary on the times. While Forster is definitely more than a little troubled and has severe anger issues in is hard not to feel sympathetic for his plight, at least early on, as the people he meets are rude, unnecessarily unhelpful or both. Michael Douglas does a great job as this troubled everyman perfectly portraying Foster's barely contained rage as all the time he is convinced that he is the 'good guy'. Robert Duvall is also on good form as Prendergast, a cop on his last day could be a bit cliché but here it is done well. The supporting cast impresses too; most notably Rachel Ticotin and Barbara Hershey as Prendergast's friend and colleague Detective Sandra Torres and Foster's ex-wife respectively. Throughout the film there are moments of action; some of it fairly tense, some of it amusing and one moment, where Foster uses a rocket launcher at a construction site delightfully over the top. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film.",Falling Down
10,BA_Harrison,"There but for the grace of God, go I?",9,2 December 2015,"Who hasn't dreamt of complaining loudly when faced with a disappointingly limp burger at one of the world's largest fast food restaurants? Or longed to vent their spleen at greedy shopkeepers who overcharge for basic goods? Or imagined launching an RPG into some seemingly pointless roadworks?Recently canned defence worker Bill Foster, (Michael Douglas), a powder keg of anger and frustration whose very short fuse has just run out, doesn't just fantasise about such things: abandoning his car in a jam on the freeway, he sets off on foot to visit his young daughter at Venice Beach, leaving a trail of escalating violence and destruction in his wake, using extreme force to deal with every obstacle.Foster's rampage through gangland LA eventually comes to the attention of soon-to-be-retired cop Prendergast (Robert Duvall), who tries to apprehend the armed and dangerous D-Fens (as he is also known) before he can reach the home of his frightened ex-wife Beth (Barbara Hershey).Director Joel Schumacher has more than his fair share of detractors (most of whom cite the admittedly god-awful Batman and Robin to support their argument), but Falling Down is just one of several films that go to prove that the guy is no talentless hack (The Lost Boys and 8mm are also amongst my favourites of his).From the excellent opening crane shot which crawls from a close up of Douglas's face, out of his car, over the queue of traffic, and back into the vehicle, Schumacher's direction is simply superb: visually stunning, the city of LA—captured in the sweltering heat of mid summer—is as much a character as any of the humans, its contrast of urban decay and opulent wealth used to highlight the injustices of life; expertly paced, Foster's gradual journey from angry average Joe to psychotic loony is utterly convincing.Of course, Schumacher owes much of his film's success to star Douglas, who puts in a wonderfully nuanced performance, keeping his progressively violent character sympathetic to the end: Foster is not a monster, but a sad product of a society that keeps piling on the pressure until breaking point. It's thought provoking stuff, now more than ever in these days of mass shootings and acts of random violence.",Falling Down
11,moonspinner55,Darkly comic modern-day diatribe strains credulity...,5,17 May 2009,"Los Angeles police detective takes over case of a mild-mannered, unemployed man who has embarked on a relatively unplanned crime-spree after freaking out at the craziness of urban living. Laborious, misguided, mishandled film from director Joel Schumacher, which makes a stab at social satire without having the courage to stay truthful, and therefore fails at being both darkly comic and meaningful. Anti-hero, square-peg-in-the-round-hole movies seldom work because they date so badly (what was once absurd and harrowing may seem tame compared to today's headlines), yet Michael Douglas' strong central performance goes a long way at keeping the film on track. Robert Duvall does decent work as the cop, yet Duvall's attempt to give the routine role some added depth isn't really warranted--there's too much of him; Barbara Hershey and Tuesday Weld have even less to work with as the women in their lives. Callow Schumacher is irritatingly fond of cheap shock effects, manipulation, and obtuse details when what he should be focused on are the film's central issues. Nearly every half-successful play is eventually fumbled. ** from ****",Falling Down
12,paul_haakonsen,One man against the entire world...,7,21 June 2018,"""Falling Down"" is a very memorable movie, and it is the type of movie that once you've seen it then you will always remember it. Yeah, because director Joel Schumacher and writer Ebbe Roe Smith really came up with something truly unique here.The story in ""Falling Down"" is an entertaining one for sure, and it is a blast to follow D-Fens/Foster (played by Michael Douglas) in his quest to return to his estranged family and having what seems like the entire world turn against him.Not only is it a solid storyline and plot that carries the movie, but it is first and foremost an amazing performance by Michael Douglas. And the role he was portraying here was a very different one from the usual roles he used to play in his movies, a bold move career-wise, but one that seemed to pan out quite nicely. Robert Duvall was also doing an amazing job in the movie, but then again he usually always is.The pacing in ""Falling Down"" is quite good, because the movie starts out in a pretty high gear and it doesn't really slow down to becoming dull or anything at any time throughout the course of the entire movie.The movie does raise some interesting issues if you think about it, such as are you yourself the root of the cause to all your problems, or is it mere circumstance, or is society conspiring against us all? And in that aspect, then it is definitely a blast to follow Foster as he makes his way through Los Angeles and face his problems head on.""Falling Down"" is a movie that can sustain multiple viewings. I think this is actually my fourth time to sit down and watch it since it was initially released, and it is as good and entertaining today as it was the very first time I saw it.",Falling Down
13,blanche-2,Mama said there'd be days like this,7,17 April 2015,"Michael Douglas is a disturbed man who's had it in ""Falling Down"" from 1993).After being stuck in traffic, William Foster takes off on his own. Going into a store run by a Korean, he objects to the prices of items, takes the owner's baseball bat, and starts beating him and the merchandise. He's on a roll.After he beats some gang members, he calls his ex-wife on the phone. The gang goes looking for him, sees him, and starts shooting. People fall left and right. Not Foster. The gang crashes their car. Foster walks over to them, all dead but one, and says to the one alive, ""You missed."" He shoots him with the guy's gun, steals the bag of guns the gang was carrying and takes off.Complaints start coming into the police precinct, where it's Prendergast's last day, and he has his own problems. Eventually he puts two and two together and realizes this is the same guy with whom he was in the traffic jam. Over his wife's (Tuesday Weld) objections, he stays late to see if he can find Foster.I think anyone living an urban life, especially in a big city, can sympathize with the Foster character. We've all felt like he has, life can really get to you. Foster's ex-wife (Barbara Hershey) is terrified of him and has an order of protection on him. It's his daughter's birthday and he's told he can't see her. He lost his job a month ago and his mother still thinks he's working. Life's problems pile up.The scariest scene takes place in a surplus shop, and it goes to show that times really haven't changed. This movie could have been made yesterday. The Nazi loving redneck running it (Frederic Forrest) who is, admittedly, way out there, objects to having two gay guys in his store and drives them out. ""I reserve the right,"" he yells at them. He hates everyone - Jews, gays, you name it.Douglas does an excellent job as a man who has had just one too many things go wrong on a boiling hot Los Angeles day. Robert Duvall does a masterful job as Prendergast, a man who suffered a tragedy in his life and understands his aggressive wife better than anyone. Tuesday Weld is amazing in the character role of the wife, moving out of the blond beauty leading lady parts easily.Most of us plow through to the next day. Foster falls down. Admittedly his world is sadder. ""I did everything they told me,"" he says, speaking of his time serving his country. We all do and somehow, like Foster, it just doesn't turn out as we expected.",Falling Down

Michael Douglas gives his best performance yet as a middle aged man who is now gone completely insane.  I compare it to American Beauty and George Carlin because basically that is what this is.  A regular guy who's had enough of life (and goes around lecturing people about how life for him sucks). Still, Schumacher, Douglas and co-star Robert Duvall try their best and succeed with perfect precision.  One of the best films of 1993.",Falling Down

I remember when the movie was released in the States it made a lot of money at the box office but many critics absolutely despised it with many of them criticising the movie for having racist overtones . I think they`re over reacting , America does suffer from gangs drive by shootings , ethnic divides , massive gaps between rich and poor etc and the film does point this out but my problem with it isn`t that Ebbe Roe Smith mentions this , but mentions it in a totally heavy handed way . His script is also somewhat unfocussed . Logically speaking the film should play out like a Roger Waters or Matt Johnson soundtrack of a man being crushed by the unfairness of life but the script mixes in too many themes and tones to work and there`s a scene in an army surplus store that feels it should belong to an entirely different movie .For the most part director Joel Schumacher can`t really be blamed for this film`s flaws and I find it totally ridiculous that he has a reputation as one of Hollywood`s worst directors . Come on it`s not like he`s Michael Bay , Victor Salva or Jan De Bont . My only real criticism of Schumacher is that D-Fens doesn`t really come across as bitter enough on screen or that the cop trying to catch him doesn`t seem intense enough . Maybe the director should have cast Jack Nicolson in one of the roles or swapped the roles around for Douglas and Duvall .A not very good movie spoiled by the script rather than the direction",Falling Down

18,poolandrews,"""I am not economically viable."" Starts out great, ends up OK.",7,3 July 2007,"Falling Down starts on a gridlocked Los Angeles freeway, the seemingly ordinary William Foster (Michael Douglas) is stuck in his car on a swelteringly hot day, the noise of car horns & people shouting begins to bother him, then there's the fly which is buzzing around his head. Finally he snaps & gets out of his car & decides to walk home, on the way he wants to call his ex-wife Beth (Barbara Hershey) & check on his daughter Adele (Joey Hope Singer). However he runs out of change, he goes into the nearest shop to ask for some but the owner (Michael Paul Chan) won't give him any. William completely flips & smashes the shop up with a baseball bat but still pays for his Coke, he sets off on foot across L.A. & gets into more trouble as he fights back against the things in society which annoy him...This French American co-production was directed by Joel Schumacher & is an interesting film that almost works, as it is it's a watchable piece of moralistic exploitation but it isn't quite the classic that it could have been. The script by Ebbe Roe Smith has a fascinating premise that many of us have probably thought about doing ourselves that of an ordinary man lashing out against the petty bureaucracy & the pressures of everyday life in a spectacular way. It's starts out terrifically with Douglas just leaving his car in the middle of a traffic jam because walking would be quicker & I just love the scene in the burger restaurant where he makes a impassioned speech about the difference in the picture of a burger & the one he actually gets as it's a scene I can really relate to! However while Falling Down starts out as a dark comedic attack on consumerism & has a nice social commentary running through it the film doesn't do anything with it at all & quickly jettisons it in favour of a standard psycho on the loose & the police who are tracking him down type scenario which is nothing new & Douglas's character becomes like those he was initially targeting. By the time Douglas is using bazooka rocket launchers to blow freeway construction sites up the film has run out of steam & feels like it's forgotten it's own purpose. The ending where Douglas suddenly realises he has become the bad guy would have been good if the film had maintained it's attack on consumerism & petty law making but it doesn't so it isn't.Director Schumacher does alright, he keeps things moving along I suppose & there are some funny moments together with the more violent ones. I wouldn't call Falling Down an action flick but there are a few set-pieces here. The film starts out so well I'm not sure what happened to it but somewhere along the line it loses it's initial appeal. There's some violence, someone is stabbed in the shoulder, there's a drive by shooting, people are beaten with baseball bats & a construction site is blown up. The film also has racist overtones, Douglas comments on the Korean shop owner not being able to speak proper English as he smashes his shop up, all the gun wielding gangs are of Mexican origin, there's anti gay dialogue, one character is a Nazi who hates gays, blacks & foreigners, the homeless are portrayed as aggressive lying beggars & Douglas has a rant about the rich at the end in which he lets someone die because he's playing golf.Technically the film is very good with on location L.A. shooting, it certainly has that big budget look about it & it has high production values. The IMDb says that Falling Down was filmed between 29th April & 4th May 1992, so the IMDb are saying Falling Down was shot in a week! I think they need to find more reliable sources... The acting is OK, Douglas is alright as the anti-hero while Duvall is alright as the cop tracking him down.Falling Down could have been a classic had it been consistent throughout, as it is it's still an entertaining film with a dark humorous streak that I liked. It's a good film for sure but it could have been even better.",Falling Down
19,zardoz-13,Uncompromising Saga About Dislocation and Intolerance,10,20 April 2014,"""Batman Forever"" director Joel Schumacher made a cutting edge movie about dislocation in our zoo of a society where everybody is in a sense 'lost.'

The day that he is set to retire LAPD Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall of ""Joe Kidd"") finds himself up to his ears into a series of homicides involving an enigmatic character, William Foster (Michael Douglas of ""Last Vegas""), who is an unemployed defense scientists. During his heyday, Foster designed missiles to protect America. Since he has lost his job and divorced his wife Beth (Barbara Hershey of ""Beaches""), Bill has been living with his mother. Of course, he hasn't told his mom a thing about losing his job. He keeps up appearances by packing his lunch in an attaché case and heading off to work. When ""Falling Down"" unfolds, our protagonist finds himself caught up in gridlocked traffic. He blows his cool at this point when it becomes too much to handle. The air conditioner in his automobile doesn't work and Foster is about to burn up. He abandons his automobile to trudge off from the freeway to a convenience store where he tries to buy a Coca-Cola from the Korean proprietor, Mr. Lee (Michael Paul Chan of ""The Goonies""), who wants to charge him 85 cents for the beverage. Foster has been trying to reach his ex-wife by telephone because he is coming home to help his daughter, Adele (Joey Hope Singer) celebrate her birthday. Between the time that he smashes up Mr. Lee's store until he shoots it out with Prendergast on the pier at Venice Beach, he collides with trigger-happy Hispanic thugs, an Aryan (Frederick Forrest) who runs an Army & Navy surplus store, and several other villains. Los Angeles is presented as a zoo with all sorts of objectionable people. Sometimes, depending on much of a racist you are, you may find Foster's antics rewarding. The conflict in the fast-food restaurant when Foster cannot order breakfast because only lunch is being served is hilarious. Foster's tutorial that he receives from a young African-American kid on a bicycle is fantastic, too! His encounter with the Hispanic ruffians who try to extort money from him is good. Eventually, this idiots load up in a car and come after him with an arsenal of firearms, but when they try to cut him down in a drive-by shooting, they miss him entirely, crash their car, and guess who finds them? Foster strolls up, relieves them of their armory, and shoots of the survivors in the leg. As tragic as ""Falling Down"" is, you may still find it entertaining. Initially, we feel sympathetic toward Foster until he eventually crosses the line and harms harmlessly individuals. Even then some of these people bring problems on themselves. The scene at the golf course is pretty funny, but Foster winds up killing an egotistical golfer who needs his medication. Meanwhile, our detective hero tangles with his wife on the telephone until he gets fed up with her. The performances are all memorable as is this controversial film with commentary galore. You won't forget ""Falling Down.""",Falling Down
20,grantss,Excellent story about a peaceful man who has reached his breaking point,9,31 July 2016,"It is a sweltering summer day in Los Angeles and a man (known only by his car registration: D-Fens) is stuck in his car in an early- morning traffic jam. It is his daughter's birthday and his only aim is to see her on her special day. Abandoning his car in the traffic he sets out to get to the house of his ex-wife to see his daughter. Along the way he meets all manner of obstacles, causing his pent-up frustration at the hindrances and absurdities of life and cynicism and criminality of average people to boil over. What follows is a peaceful man's violent odyssey, an odyssey to see his daughter. Excellent movie. The story is very relatable and engaging - an everyday man is pushed to his limit by criminals, employers, unethical or overly-officious store owners, bigots and society in general and lashes out. Years of toeing the line have got him nowhere - his wife has divorced him and taken his daughter with her and he is a pushover. Now, when all he wants is one small pleasure - to see his daughter - even that becomes an impossible task. The scenarios are very plausible and frustrating and have you supporting D-Fens, for the most part (more on that later). Some very funny situations too - the fast food scene was hilarious.However, while it starts funny the movie gets darker as more aspects of D-fens' character are revealed. Great character progression.On that note, the one problem with the movie is the way the central character is presented. Initially he is a hero, as his ""victims"" are quite loathsome - incorrigible store managers, gangsters, neo- Nazi bigots. However, later on his target selection is more erratic and irrational - golf clubs, plastic surgeons, construction workers/highways. He is also presented as not being entirely sane. While his progression/degeneration from rational vigilante to irrational cynic is plausible, this diminishes his hero status and muddies the message somewhat.Great work by Michael Douglas in the lead role. Solid performance by Robert Duvall as the police detective, Prendergast. Good support from Barbara Hershey and Rachel Ticotin.",Falling Down
21,Boba_Fett1138,"Huh, a Joel Schumacher film that is actually great? You better believe it!",8,27 June 2006,"This movie was one of the most surprising of the '90's. It has a refreshingly original concept and it works great as a social comment.This movie is often being compared to ""Taxi Driver"". Although there are some similarities between these two movies, ""Taxi Driver"" is in a whole different league. ""Falling Down"" is less heavy and more lighthearted. Although, the fact that the movie here on IMDb is being categorized as a comedy isn't exactly right. The movie is more of a thriller that is brought in a refreshing and not too heavy way but never without loosing its power or without making a statement.Mostly the movie is more of a social comment then anything else. It shows how an more or less average man one day gets fed up with the rotten society and tries to take matters into his own hands, which gets him into some 'unlikely' but also still somewhat recognizable situations. The movie is told in such a way that it implies that this could happen to every one of us. Therefor it's a bit too bad that toward the ending it becomes more and more obvious that the main character already had psychological problems to begin with. It doesn't really make the movie any less powerful or without making its point clear but its also a sort of an unnecessary addition to the story, that becomes a bit too 'Hollywood-ized' because of this. The movie its story is nothing too impressive but yet it is refreshing and enough stuff to make you think.It's too bad that Michael Douglas never plays more roles like this. He is excellent in this movie and above all, he is highly believable in his role. I even dare to say that this is one of his very best roles till date. Robert Duvall is also great as the detective. The movie isn't you average 'cop hunts down psychopath who causes mayhem and destruction', which it easily could had turned into. I really have the feeling that this is also largely thanks to Robert Duvall, who plays his role very humane and gives his character a certain extra.The events portrayed in the movie might feel a bit too silly and far fetched at times but the movie does makes its points clear. The movie isn't anything too heavy so you can also expect to be entertained. It makes ""Falling Down"" a perfectly brought and balanced thriller that is refreshingly original, entertains and makes you think as well.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Falling Down
22,view_and_review,The Last Straw Has Been Placed,9,16 April 2020,"Is it OK for me to say that this is my favorite Michael Douglas movie? I know he's been in ""Wall Street,"" ""War of the Roses,"" ""Basic Instinct,"" ""The Star Chamber,"" and ""Fatal Attraction,"" but I have to give this movie the nod.The movie starts off so fantastically. Michael Foster (Michael Douglas) is stuck in L.A. traffic--it's hot, his AC isn't working, he can't roll down his window, horns are honking, children are screaming, and a fly is in his car pestering him. It was at that point he got out of his late 70's Pacer or Pinto and left. It was so socially unacceptable yet so brave--something that we all have wanted to do at one point or another.Michael Foster continued to do things we've all probably thought about, but would never do. His path was a lonely one which had no chance of ending well for him, but if he only knew how many hearts and minds were with him.We've all been extremely frustrated. ""Falling Down"" was for every frustrated person. If Michael Foster were a superhero he'd be called Frustrated Man, or Frustrateo, or something along those lines. He wasn't a vigilante going out exacting revenge, he was just physically venting. The last straw had been placed, the last nerve had been worked, ""I've had it up to here"" had been breached, now it was time to let loose.",Falling Down
23,AaronCapenBanner,Rising Up,8,11 December 2013,"Joel Schumacher directed this compelling drama that stars Michael Douglas as William 'D-Fens' Foster, a recently laid-off defense factory worker, and most disgruntled, frustrated, and rebellious man who one day abandons his car during a heat-wave in a traffic jam and proceeds on a personal odyssey through the streets of Los Angeles, ostensibly to reunite with his ex-wife(played by Barbara Hershey) and young daughter, but along the way encounters a myriad of gang members, ungrateful foreigners, inconsiderate fast food restaurants, a confused Nazi, and callous golfers who test his patience and sanity. Robert Duvall plays investigating police detective Prendergast, who also has a troubled wife(played by Tuesday Weld) but has handled his life differently. Douglas is superb, giving a believable performance as a good man who has simply lost his way, and crosses the line into madness(after he shoots up the restaurant) Says a great many pertinent things about modern day life, that still hold true today. Entertaining and thought-provoking film is quite underrated, and remains a cult favorite. Deserves comparisons with 'Death Wish"", having similar(yet different) lead characters.",Falling Down
24,FlashCallahan,I'm the bad guy?.....,10,19 March 2015,"William Foster, also known by his license plate as D-FENS, is an unemployed, divorced engineer in the defence industry who's had enough. First he finds himself in gridlock, which he deals with by abandoning his car. He then comes across an unhelpful convenience store clerk whose prices D-FENS 'argues, by demolishing the store with a baseball. He finds himself in gangland, and deals with gang members by attacking them and running them off. With their own weapons. When the gang retaliate, D-FENS takes their bag full of guns, and heads towards Venice for his young daughter's birthday party....Say what you want about the films subject matter, or it's rightly controversial characters, we all know a D-FENS, or at least someone who tries to put the world to rights.His cause may be just, but he's just another statistic who has been dealt a bad hand. He lost his job, his wife, and now everything seems desolate to him, where is life taking him? So is he right to be bitter, is he right to attack a shopkeeper because his prices are to high? Maybe not, but he sure has a right to defend himself when the shopkeeper goes to attack him.But then in turn, its possible that the shopkeeper has been attacked on several occasion, and by looks of where the store is situated, a person dressed like D-FENS wouldn't really be his typical patron, so this film could potentially hold a wealth of debatable material.The same could be said for the surplus owner, his outburst regarding sexual orientation could be just a shield for his own secrets. Maybe he's too scared to 'come out' because of his beliefs. After all, he reacts with what appears to be sexual frustration when D-FENS disagrees with him.And the film is covered with subliminal images. Almost every billboard sign and printed message coincides with the days events, or what is going to happen.It's also strikingly hilarious. The Whammyburger scene looks like its just been added to relieve the tension, and we've all wanted to smack a big mouthed driver at least once.Douglas is sensational as the desperate man who is fed up with society, and even though he thinks he's doing nothing wrong, it's just happening to him, but he's dealing with it all the wrong way.Support is brilliant, and it's probably Schumachers finest hour.",Falling Down
25,safenoe,Guest starring Michael Paul Chan,6,2 November 2020,"Michael Paul Chan makes an electrifying debut in this movie featuring Michael Douglas, who was at the peak of his career, coming fresh off Basic Instinct. But curiously a decade later, Michael Douglas had a string of flops: Don't Say A Word, It Runs in the Family, The In-Laws, The Sentinel.But a decade after Falling Down, the other Michael, yes Michael Paul Chan, was starting to hit his peak, debuting in The Closer and then Major Crimes.It was Michael Douglas's career that fell down after Falling Down.",Falling Down
26,The_Void,"Falling Down thrills, entertains and makes some good points",8,21 May 2006,"Falling Down is a film that works in two ways; on face value, it's an absurd fantasy about a man, who takes it upon himself to get revenge on society, and if you look a little deeper; it's a film about the decay of society itself, although being a Joel Schumacher movie; things never get too deep. It's easy to see the confrontations that Douglas has with various people as comical, and also rather coincidental - but the film takes it's comedy to an extent to that it really bites, and Falling Down certainly benefits from it's edge of humour. The film follows the idea of a man on the edge; a man sick of it all. William Foster was always a perfectionist, but he's about to become a vigilante as a traffic jam forces him to consider his position, and when he decides to get out of his car and make his way 'home' to his daughter, so begins a violent odyssey through the imperfect streets of Los Angeles. All this happens on the same day that veteran police officer Martin Prendergast is retiring to live with his wife; but first he must find the white shirt-wearing, briefcase-carrying madman causing havoc in the city.This film really comes together because of an absolutely great performance from Michael Douglas. I'm not a big fan of Douglas, but here he looks sinister enough to be believable, while retaining a potent flavour of satiety to ensure that the film works as an expose of the things that a lot of would like to do. The image of Douglas' short-wearing office worker trudging through the streets, baseball bat in hand is one of the truly indelible images of this film. The meetings that Douglas has with various members of society, including a territorial gang, a couple of golf players and, best of all, a Neo-Nazi gun shop owner are absurdly funny, and while something of a coincidence; many of them see Douglas make a good point, and the most shocking thing about this movie stems from the fact that we know the lead character is a social deviant - but he's so often right! As you might expect, the action scenes are well done and often take centre focus - but Schumacher never lets the focus leave the main character and his plight. Overall, Falling Down is a film that both entertains and makes its audience think, and I wouldn't hesitate to name this film as one of the very best of the nineties.",Falling Down
27,Mr-Fusion,Falls down on its face,3,16 March 2015,"Does everyone in ""Falling Down"" have to be a dick? Of course not, but that's the movie, apparently. Michael Douglas has had enough of society's decay and proceeds to paint the town to his liking. With guns. There might actually be something to this social drama if everyone he meets wasn't a stereotype: the convenience story guy, the gangbangers, the fast food workers, the construction guy, the entitled golfers . . . they're all irrationally rude and out to ruin his day. This thing's got all the subtlety of a jackhammer.It also doesn't help that Douglas meets every obstacle with screams and violence. He doesn't do this because of the heat and the stress. He does so because he's been unstable for years. There isn't much commentary to be made if nearly every character in your movie is so poorly drawn, especially if your ""average Joe"" hero is a sociopathic bully. Robert Duvall has more to work with here, but he takes a backseat to Douglas' obtuse rage. And at the end of the day, after all of the tirades and spent shells, Douglas even has the nerve to ask, ""I'm the bad guy? How did that happen?"" This is beyond cheap.3/10",Falling Down
28,JamesHitchcock,Peace Dividend,8,18 April 2010,"During his heyday in the eighties and early nineties, Michael Douglas seemed to specialise in what might be regarded as ""issue movies""- films which dealt with some particularly controversial or sensational social issue. Thus ""The Star Chamber"" dealt with vigilantism, ""Wall Street"" with white-collar crime and corruption, ""Fatal Attraction"" with stalking and ""Disclosure"" with sexual harassment. ""Falling Down"", perhaps Douglas's most controversial film, can be described as a ""super-issue"" movie as it manages to package a number of social issues in one.The film is set in the course of a single hot summer's day in Los Angeles. Early in the morning, with the temperature already rising, a man abandons his car in a traffic jam and sets out to walk across the city. In the course of the film we learn that his name is William Foster, that he is in his late thirties and that he lives with his elderly mother. He was at one time employed as a draughtsman in the defence industry, but was made redundant about a month earlier. He is divorced from his former wife Beth, by whom he has a daughter, Adele. The purpose of his cross-city journey is to see Adele on her birthday.Along the way, Foster is involved in a series of bizarre incidents. There is not space to describe them all here, but they mostly involved him reacting with increasing levels of violence to various provocations, some of them trivial, from those he encounters. The first such incident comes, for example, when he goes into a Korean-owned grocery shop to get change for a telephone call and ends up smashing the place up in protest against the owner's high prices and his surly and uncooperative attitude. Foster's behaviour brings him to the attention of the police, and Martin Prendergast, an officer on the eve of his retirement, takes on the task of tracking him down.The film was released in 1993 but was filmed the previous year, towards the end of the presidency of George Bush senior, and captures the feeling of disillusionment which afflicted America surprisingly soon after the end of the Cold War and victory in the first Gulf War. After the fall of the Berlin Wall people began to talk of a ""peace dividend"", as it seemed that the money once used for expensive defence projects could now be diverted to more socially constructive purposes, but the early nineties were to turn out to be a period of economic recession, the leading reason for Bush's defeat by Clinton in the presidential election. (""It's the economy, stupid!"") For former defence workers like Foster, who had helped defend America against Communism, there was to be no peace dividend, only unemployment.Besides losing his job, Foster has another major grievance. His divorce was evidently a bitter one, and Beth has obtained a restraining order against him, even though she admits he has never used or threatened violence against her. Her aim seems to be to cut him not only out of her life but out of Adele's life as well. When Foster eventually reaches her house, Beth is horrified, but the little girl is overjoyed.This is probably Michael Douglas's best film, better even than ""Wall Street"". In many of his films, Douglas plays tough, self-confident characters (the monstrous Gordon Gekko in ""Wall Street"" being a good example), but here he plays the archetypal put-upon Mr Average in a performance which expresses not only anger but also pain and sadness. Rather surprisingly, Douglas was not Oscar-nominated for this role; indeed, the Academy ignored the film altogether, possibly regarding it as too controversial. He also received excellent support from Robert Duvall as the quiet, patient Prendergast, Frederic Forrest as a creepy Neo-Nazi extremist and Tuesday Weld as the difficult Mrs Prendergast.A lot of comments on the film centre upon which of the two main characters we sympathise with. At first sight the answer seems obvious. Foster commits several criminal offences, some of them serious, in the course of his journey. Prendergast, despite his own frustrations- he is unhappily married to a neurotic wife and is unpopular with many of his colleagues- is a model citizen and professional who stoically and patiently goes about his duty of enforcing the law. Some have seen Foster as a dangerous right-wing vigilante, and there is some evidence to support this. His behaviour towards the Korean shopkeeper, for example, does suggest racist attitudes on his part.Yet the film is rather more complex than a simple case of right versus wrong. The title, taken from the nursery rhyme ""London Bridge is Falling Down"", can be seen as referring to either Foster's mental collapse or to the state of American society. Foster perceives the flaws and injustices of that society- unemployment, crime, poverty, abuse of power, extremism- and, in his crazed way, decides to do something about them. His actions may be extreme, but the frustrations which lead to those actions are something shared by many American citizens. It should be noted that not all his concerns are those of the political Right- the one person he actually kills (in self-defence) is the Neo-Nazi.In the words of Peter Finch's character in ""Network"", Foster is mad as hell and he's not going to take it any more. As in ""Network"" it is a man on the verge of madness who can see more clearly than the sane. Prendergast's peaceful acceptance of misfortune can be seen either as admirable stoicism or as the spineless conformism of the little man who, by rights, should be mad as hell but who just goes on taking it. 8/10",Falling Down

30,StevePulaski,I don't appreciate you bein' round,9,31 December 2011,"We all hit our breaking point, but what do we do when we get there? Falling Down tells the terrifying story a white-collar man who has been fired and is now getting revenge on his city on the hottest day of the summer. This is not your traditional revenge film. It's much darker, seamier, and more uncomfortable than any drama in recent years.Michael Douglas plays Bill Foster, a man who once had it all. A steady job, a great wife, and a kid. Through a series of unfortunate circumstances, Bill has lost almost everything. On the hottest day of the year in Los Angeles, he loses his patience. ""I'm going home"" he claims as he leaves his car on the freeway after a taunting, very realistic sequence at the beginning of the film. The remainder of the film shows him returning home to his wife, who doesn't want to see him ever again, so he can give his kid a birthday present.On his way home, Bill runs into all sorts of crazy, patient-testing circumstances. For example, being a few minutes after the breakfast curfew at a fast food restaurant or wandering into the wrong side of town. The outcome of each is completely unexpected and very different from what reason might tell us. The great thing about these sequences is they're genuine and discard any form of clichés we've come across in other action films.Falling Down's excellent filmmaking reminded me of a very underrated thriller I enjoyed about a year ago. It was called The Trigger Effect and was overlooked by pretty much everyone. The direction both films took was impeccable, and each created such an amazing atmosphere for their respected issue. In Falling Down, we get a great look at the seamy side of the city. Some points we feel hot-headed like the character or just plain hot from the heat that seems to be drifting from the screen into the audience. The atmosphere is exquisite, and going back to the opening scene, it depicts a plethora of things that we hear on the streets, only magnified. What makes Michael Douglas's character snap is because he is hearing horns honking, smells the exhaust from cars, feels the heat, feels a fly on the back of his neck and hears it buzzing, etc. All of these things are quibbles we have about every day life, but it's the little things that final push the character off the small edge he's standing on.In The Trigger Effect, the characters are going through a power outage. The seamy qualities of the town like looting, robbery, and low patience seem to also spill out onto the audience. That was a great thriller not only for its plot and dialog, but its believable scenarios complimented by its perfect atmosphere.I think one of the most overlooked aspects on Falling Down is its social commentary on the world we inhabit now. Arrogance in society has now etched itself in being the norm, and we look at snobby attitudes as the typical lifestyle today. It's unbelievable. What was considered low class back in the fifties, is now considered normal in the 2000's. Never did we think something like swearing, gangs, fights, guns, robbery, and just plain ignorance would be the normal lifestyle. Guess what? It is. And it has been on the rise for years.The film also silently sneaks in political undertones. In an effort to show centrist political opinions, the character of Bill Foster is portrayed as a person favoring both political parties. Scenes establish he doesn't believe in welfare and others establish that he is for anti-immigrations laws. Falling Down doesn't bleed politics, but doesn't hesitate to sneak them in. I believe it furthers the creation of the character as a person. We can learn more about him even in the grittiest circumstances.Falling Down not only gave me a great movie experience, but it showed me the un-sugarcoated life of the world. Rarely do we get such brutal honesty in the world today. The film shows us that the truth must come with less sugar and more facts. Schumacher has successfully concocted another true-to-life thriller.NOTE: I neglected to mention the subplot involving Robert Duvall playing a cop trying to stop Foster's crimes. I felt that it wasn't wholly necessary, and we needed less of that and more identifiable urgency in the film.Starring: Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall. Directed by: Joel Schumacher.",Falling Down

Not to sound psycho, but also, I wanted to scream at the construction workers, they are destroying a perfectly fine street!

Douglas is wonderful in his role of an average Joe Schmoe gone haywire, and Robert Duvall is vivid and deep as the cop on the chase. Falling Down may have a few incredibilities (though I remember going through a lot of situations in the film Douglas went through-though I never was angry enough to pull a shotgun out), but it's more symbolic than anything. I think the funniest part is the burger restaurant, obviously a mimic of McDonalds, and Douglas' reaction. It's kind of like he realizes, ""Hey, I'm this far, why not complain about the burger while I'm at it? It's always bugged me anyway!""   Falling Down represents all Americans: the aggravations, road rage we hear about, everything. Every day situations in a new perspective.      5/5 stars-

33,Red-Barracuda,Blackly comic thriller with powerhouse lead performance,10,1 April 2010,"This is the film that really shows what Michael Douglas is capable of as an actor. In it, he plays a mentally unstable everyman who cracks while stuck in a traffic jam on a blazing hot summer's day in L.A. He abandons his car and sets off on a journey across the city to see his ex-wife and daughter on the day of the little girl's birthday. Douglas is simply outstanding in this role. His character is a complex one. While he is clearly a dangerous man, who is a definite danger to his wife and daughter, we also feel some empathy with him in his odyssey across the city. His journey is essentially a string of encounters with, for the most part, very unsympathetic people – a greedy shop-owner, a couple of gangsters, a Nazi, an obnoxious man outside a phone booth, a scrounger, a snobbish golfer, a fast-food manager, idle road-workers. Because he has gone over the edge he has no problem with giving these characters a piece of his mind and resorts to violence when required too. These encounters are often blackly comic with Douglas in his element delivering his brand of justice. Although you know he is going about things in a completely over-the-top way it's hard not to cheer him on.Falling Down reminded me a bit of the 1968 Burt Lancaster movie The Swimmer, where a man travels home by swimming through all of his neighbours pools. Both films share the idea of mentally troubled men with terrible home lives travelling home-wards via a succession of encounters, although in the case of Falling Down we are aware from the outset that Michael Douglas has a screw loose. This also has crime-thriller elements too but it shares the earlier film's complex central character. We never really know what Douglas did in order for his marriage to end but we are given various clues as to his instability and potential for violence. He is a fascinating central character.Able support is given by Robert Duvall as a police officer who is in some ways a mirror image of Douglas; an opposite with similarities. While he shares the protagonists problematic home-life and both men are soon to be out of work – although in Duvall's case it's his own choice – as a man his problems stem from opposite characteristics, where Douglas is too volatile, Duvall is too placid. They make for a great pair of central characters to hang the movie on. The other notable presence in the film is Frederic Forrest as the Nazi shopkeeper. You won't forget that character in a hurry; he is an extremely well-observed creation brilliantly played by Forrest.This is a great film that is paced excellently. The balance of thrills and drama is very well handled too. It's no ordinary crime-thriller though as it doesn't always give easy answers to where our sympathies should lie. It's often very funny too. Definitely recommended.",Falling Down
34,disdressed12,a social commentary on our times(with a searing performance by Michael Douglas),10,25 January 2008,"wow.this movie blew me away.it was relevant then,and it even more relevant today.Michael Douglas gives a searing performance as an ordinary man who has a really bad day,and explodes under the pressure.his character is someone anyone who lives in the big city can relate to and feel empathy for.not only does the film examine what happens when an ordinary is pushed past the breaking limit,it also examines the ramification of that person's action and the effect on that person and others.it also shows how silly we have gotten as a society,with all of our ridiculous ways of doing business.it's almost as if things are set up deliberately for someone to lose control.Joel Schumacker(Phonebooth)directed this movie and although i'm not generally a fan,he impressed me here.i also liked the writing and the dialogue.the supporting cast are also good,but this is Douglas's show.to,me this is a career making performance.a masterpiece,if i've ever seen one.10+++/10",Falling Down

I was impressed by the sense and style of this movie and to see how a average guy gets beaten down by the world and the rage takes over him even if he is a bit psychotic. My favorite scene in the whole movie was the one in the fast food restaurant it was just something a lot of people can agree with and it was hysterical. The film basically show how the decay of society can drive some people mad, and the anti-hero just goes bonkers gradually even more as important things in his life get taken away. This film does show that there is something wrong with our society and corrupt which was the highlight of the film. The thing is some of the stuff Micheal Douglas character had to go through and felt the same way at times and to see what we wanted to do on screen was just awesome. There is just more to this film than some people may think.8/10",Falling Down
36,thesar-2,And what do you do when you fall down?,9,8 November 2009,"One of the finer examples that Michael Douglas can act, and not be type-cast as the psycho-woman attractor as he did in 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Basic Instinct,' is 'Falling Down.' He did an excellent job as the person some of us actually secretly wish we could model: the indestructible anti-hero that's ""Mad as hell, and not going to take it anymore!"" One of the best aspects is that unlike some anti-heroes ('The Punisher') he didn't set out, nor wishes to be a vigilante. He was just a man who reached his limit awhile back and now can't hold it in anymore. He just, for lack of a better term, wants to ""go home."" Synopsis: Bill leaves his car in the hot sun/stopped traffic one morning and begins his journey ""home"" while along the way meets some interesting characters who, well, irk him and since Bill has passed his boiling point, he has nothing to lose and tells/shows them how he feels. Mostly he does it with extremely funny dialogue I loved. Meanwhile, soon-to-be retired desk-cop Prendergast is dealing with a million issues of his own (a very ill wife, a deceased daughter, retirement) and still, he's on the case of the strange white male with a white shirt, tie and baseball bat who's wrecking havoc in the LA county. It's too bad that, despite I believe strongly on the statements Bill makes (namely fast food, those awful gangsters and the grumpy old golfers) I can't really side with his methods. And besides, unfortunately, whether or not this movie was real, nothing will change. We would still always be neighbors to these jerks. This is one of my all-time favorite movies. Douglas was brilliant and for him alone and the extreme depth Douglas showed, the movie needs to be seen.",Falling Down
37,ElMaruecan82,"""Falling Down"" is still cinematically viable ...",8,21 December 2011,"""I'm the bad guy?"" asks Michael Douglas with disbelief. I didn't want to perceive the character of William Foster aka D-Fens as a bad guy either, because this contradicted the whole rooting process the film's thought-provoking script was encouraging, so, who is he, if not the bad guy? Admittedly, D-fens incarnates the demographic category called the 'Silent Majority', the average worker, ""overeducated and under-skilled"": educated enough to 'play the game' and live with a secure job and a happy family but not skilled enough to be more than a decent family-man. Suitably, he's Caucasian, thirty-something, with a white shirt and black tie, a prototypical look with enough anonymousness to crystallize all the animosity of a society begging for convenient targets: not menacing, not carrying any weapons and not belonging to a minority, not rich enough to build a wealth on productive forces other than his, and not poor enough to live as a parasite. His life is a bunch of 'not' that classifies him in the most vulnerable social category.D-Fens' social condition immediately reminds of Travis Bickle from ""Taxi Driver"" with that three-dimensionality enriched by a psychological ticking bomb: D-Fens as the quintessential implosive angry man who accumulates pressure before finally ""Falling Down"": reaching his breaking-point. His journey into the depth of L.A. urbanism is the nightmarish experience that will turn him into a dangerous sociopath. Still, D-Fens is no Vietnam vet, he's more civilized than Bickle and it's precisely his educated behavior and negotiating manners that fan the flames of his recurrent encounters until it culminates with the 'bad guy' realization, when he laconically understands he was already 'bad' by society's standards. And Douglas' attitude is crucial as it reveals an acceptance of fate, deprived from the excitement that could have asked for a distasteful celebration.Now, 'how can society make an everyday man ""bad""?' is the interesting question the film raises, making relevant points through a clever editing. It opens with a suffocating traffic jam during a hot-summer day. Stuck between shouting husbands, ugly old broad putting her lipstick, noisy kids and an irritating fly, D-Fens, in an existentialist impulse, leaves the car and go  somewhere, a tribute to the opening of Fellini's ""8½"" leaving us with the same level of uncertainty. But I don't think a specific destination was necessary considering the episodic architecture of the plot that features many aspects of the American society's decline, starting with a banal Korean convenience store.The film is a powerful assemblage of many vignettes denouncing the degeneracy of a society so dedicated to the notion of profit, that human interactions had been reduced to slogans, prices, communication, and ownership. And the core of D-Fens constant misadventures relies on his incapability to assimilate this new language, whereas it's a sandwich picture, a vulgar graffiti, the hostility of a homeless bum or a rich golfer... The irony is that the film indirectly reflects the same issues it denounces as any viewer would feel the deepest contempt toward Frederic Forrest as the hateful Neo-Nazi surplus store owner, while we're less reluctant to find excuses for the Latino gang that attempted to kill him, as if we were already manipulated by an unconscious Manichaeism.But to accuse ""Falling Down"" of racism is a superficial mistake, because the film sympathizes with the white man as zealously as Spike Lee with Black people, but it never loses its objectivity. There's a powerful scene showing a black man protesting in the street because his bank refused a loan as he was not 'economically viable'. This man, dressed like D-Fens, was mirroring his condition as an outcast. Indeed, a society where the biggest residences are inhabited by plastic surgeons says a lot about the level of superficiality governing it and when banks consider people as economical objects, it's only fitting that people treat themselves the same way, with their appearance as the number one asset. So, why does the film make a bad guy out of a sympathetic character? Maybe it subtly helps to show how being a man is a supplementary handicap in a society where the mother has all the rights. Barbara Hershey plays Beth, the ex-wife, who refuses to let her husband see their daughter on her birthday while nothing ever seems to point out how violent and bad D-Fens was, we can only speculate that his anger management problem was more serious than Beth's apparent paranoia. Or another answer is illustrated by the Prendergast character, Robert Duvall as the cop prematurely quitting his job, an attitude that appeased his anxious wife (Tuesday Weld), but inspired the disrespect of his colleagues. ""Falling Down"" punctuates D-Fens' story with Prendergast investigation and we're led to believe that D-Fens 'falling down' will coincide with Prendergast 'rising up'.But the Prendergast subplot, despite Duvall's impeccable performance, betrays Joel Schumacher's direction, which uses an intelligent script with an obviousness that doesn't trust enough our intelligence. Portraying D-Fens as a man capable to hurt his daughter undermined his status a victim, with society responsible of his guilt. The movie describes a psychological 'falling down', which physically is an accelerating linear movement before a final impact. The impact was the direction D-Fens' journey needed, not a potential killing. The film sinned a lot by 'over-directing', like having the kid say he learned how to use a bazooka from TV, or Prendergast being constantly teased by his colleagues when we know he's getting closer to D-Fens: while we never expect what will come to D-Fens, we're always ahead of Prendergast.And the popularity of the D-Fens' clips on Youtube proves that what people most remember is how relevant the film describes 90's American society without the flashiness of 'Fight Club' or the poetry of 'American Beauty', it's a dark depiction of a 90's post-modern slice of life without concession and with more humor than many comedies and despite some flaws, one of the most important films of the 90's.",Falling Down
38,paul2001sw-1,He had a bad day,2,28 May 2006,"Martin Scorcese's taut masterpiece 'Taxi Driver' told the story of a Vietnam veteran who becomes pathologically obsessed with the lowlife of New York City. The film ambiguously combined an appeal to the audience's vigilante instincts with a desperate portrait of a man undergoing mental disintegration. Joel Schumacher attempts to scale similar ground in 'Falling Down', but unfortunately, fails miserably in this disastrous mess of a film. Michael Douglas' character is more completely (but less explicably, and also less believably) deranged than Robert de Niro was in Scorcese's movie; yet the film tries to balance this by presenting him almost as an American everyman driven to distraction by incessant provocation. This ""mad-but justified"" combo really doesn't work, but it's not the film's only failing. The sheer number of people who make Douglas' day strains credibility: he can't talk to anyone without them insulting him, and most of the people he kills conveniently turn out be holding weapons he can take with him to use on the next punk to cross his path. After a clichéd depiction of the violent inner city borders on racism, the film clumsily attempts to redress this by having Douglas set upon by a white supremacist as well. The movie's periodic transition into unsubtle comedy doesn't work either, the funniest thing being the way that, at some level, Schumacher seems to be expecting the audience to continue to take this drivel seriously. The psychology of the final showdown is also absurd, although it throws in a load of Hollywood sentimentality into the mix for good measure. Everything about this film reeks of a script written to fit a pre-defined (and derivative) concept, in a story that makes no organic sense. Schumacher has made at least one good film ('Tigerland'), and has also made plenty of mundane thrillers ('8mm', for example); but this is surely his most ridiculous movie.",Falling Down
39,MOscarbradley,A Road Movie in Reverse,8,9 February 2006,"Joel Schumacher's best film is a brilliantly realized urban nightmare that many people in the audience will identify with. On one of those typical LA dog-days, disgruntled motorist Michael Douglas, caught in what could be the traffic jam from hell, finally decides he can't take it any more, abandons his car on the freeway and decides to walk home and God help anyone who gets in his way.I suppose ""Falling Down"" could best be described as a road movie in reverse. The car has been ditched and the journey is on foot. Perhaps the film's closest antecedent is ""The Swimmer"" in which a similarly deranged Burt Lancaster decides to 'swim' home through the pools of his neighbours. As the dangerously unstable D-Fens, (he is known by his car registration), Michael Douglas gives the performance of his career and Schumacher racks up the tension to breaking point and beyond.",Falling Down
40,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It can't decide if its protagonist is a hero or a villian, but it's always entertaining while it tries.",7,24 June 2018,"There is a bit of a tonal problem in 'Falling Down (1993)' because our protagonist is, ostensibly, both the hero and the villain. The picture doesn't really know how to depict his actions, either as some unsung heroics by a man pushed too far by a corrupt system or as the dangerous crimes of an increasingly violent individual who has psychologically snapped after not being able to take the seemingly only mildly more 'unfair' conditions he faces. It's here that the picture misses the mark ever-so-slightly, making multiple attempts to be a comedy but never coming close to being funny and also coming across as almost 'in poor-taste' at a number of key moments. It also manages to perform quite a decent character study of an unstable man slowly unravelling, though, and it does so without really wasting any time. It moves fairly fast, with a pace that usually works in favour of the sometimes strange tone, and it uses film form to play with our expectations in some exciting ways. Though it does suffer from a slightly strange structure because of its somewhat unfocused nature (a by-product of its inability to decide who it wants to be its protagonist and who it wants to be its antagonist), it finds its most success as an entertaining and engaging film that examines its core characters pretty well while decently delving into the underlying philosophy that kicks off its journey, whether or not its messages may be dangerously easy to misinterpret or take to the extreme. In the end, it's only because it's entertaining that it works as well as it does. 7/10",Falling Down
41,bowmanblue,You'll never go into a fast food restaurant again without thinking of this film,10,5 June 2016,"Rumour has it that the script to 'Falling Down' was kicking around Hollywood for years before it was picked up. No one wanted to touch it, yet, once it was made, it became arguably Michael Douglas' finest performance to date and an enduring classic which is as relevant today as it was in the early nineties.A man – just a man – finally snaps which sitting in a seemingly never ending traffic jam in L.A. and decides to walk 'home' through the city. Along the way, we're given an insight into the type of people who live there and the human tragedy unfolds.Michael Douglas plays 'the man' who is mainly referred to a 'D-Fens' throughout the majority of the film due to his personalised number plate. He's already more than a little unhinged and we're treated to the final day of his breakdown. On his journey he encounters one or more people who we've probably met along the way – the types we wish we hadn't and yet have to simply roll our eyes and/or ignore them. However, D-Fens is not in the mood to ignore life's annoyances. He tackles them head on in ways we can only dream of. An example of this is when he goes into a burger bar and orders something from the 'breakfast menu' two minutes after they've stopped serving breakfast and moved onto the 'lunch menu.' Most of us would just tut to ourselves and pick a burger. D-Fens pulls out a machine gun and demands his rights to have breakfast. Wonderful.Douglas was (deservingly) nominated for an Oscar for his performance, but it's worth noting that his tale is a parallel to that of Robert Duvall's character – a cop on his last day on the force before he retires. He's the man who is the only one who can see that D-Fens' actions are slowly spiralling out of control and something needs to be done (apart from eat his retirement cake and pick up groceries for his wife). Duvall's performance is much more understated and yet equally as sad.I think the true test of a film is how it stands up to time. Apart from a lack of mobile phones (pay phones being used frequently here) Falling Down could be made today and would be just as relevant as ever. It's a film that everyone should enjoy and find it leaves them thinking of all the things we'd probably like to do if there were no consequence to our actions. However, what we do in life does have consequences and the 'D-Fens' part of our souls must remain caged (probably for the good of those around us!). Just never let me get hold of a bazooka when workmen are blocking the road ahead of me.",Falling Down
42,g-bodyl,Vintage Michael Douglas: Unhinged!,9,2 October 2014,"I was always curious to see Falling Down, but I never anticipated a director like Joel Schumacher making a film like this. Not only is it an excellent film, it's a really relevant one. It was true back in 1993, but I think it's even more true in today's world. It's the little things in the daily lives of people that can drive them crazy, as evidenced in this film. The film itself is a little clunky at times, but it has a hard-boiled script which created tough characters, but these characters work thanks to the tremendous acting.Schumacher's film is based off a simple premise and that is what would happen if someone went crazy over the daily stresses of life. This one man named William Foster only wanted to attend the birthday bash of his ex-wife's daughter. But of course he is dealt with being stuck in traffic on the hottest day of the year, so he begins a mental collapse with those standing in his way paying for it. Whether it's an over-priced soda or some gang members getting in his way, he is hell-bent on letting society know his intentions. Now it's up to a retiring cop, Prendergast to stop Foster's urban rampage.This film is incredibly acted. Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances as Foster. He does well in balancing the fine line between calmness and a quick temper to boot. While not his best performance, Robert Duvall does a good job as the elder cop on Foster's tail and is suffering with domestic issues.Overall, Falling Down can be seen as a satire at times, but its message is clear as day and it practically means that our society is crumbling apart. While this film is also seen as a crime drama, there is dark humor aplenty. There are some witty one-liners that Douglas would utter every so often. This film can also be seen as racist at times, but I don't believe Schumacher is playing to the stereotypes. Every urban area has their own nationality, so each race is fair game. This is a very good, action-packed film that effectively tackles an every day issue in our lives. I rate this film 9/10.",Falling Down
43,CuriosityKilledShawn,Mad as hell and not going to take it anymore,7,17 April 2011,"Want to see a film that will put you off living in Los Angeles for life? Look no further. As a kid I always saw the City of Angels as a glamorous, exotic place, since most movies back then were set there. But upon watching falling down at the age of 14 I went off it completely. I no longer saw it as a bustling metropolis of wealth and sunshine, but as a fragmented, angry, unjust place barely able to call itself a society.Michael Douglas stars as William Foster, a middle-aged, middle-management schlub working at a defence company who suddenly finds himself obsolete in an increasingly chaotic, senseless world. Stuck in heavy traffic one morning, he suddenly snaps, leaves his car, and crosses LA on foot en route to his daughter's birthday party. Along the way he has many encounters with what sadly passes as modern humanity. Only now he's just not going to sit by and tolerate it. He's not choosing apathy like the rest of his fellow citizens. Foster (or D-FENS) fights back face to face, unapologetically, And you know what...he's right every time.Robert Duvall plays Prendergast, the cop who puts together the pieces of D-Fens' rampage. The two men are as far apart as they are so close, but none of the LAPD care much for Prendergast's suspicions.The lazy, arrogant, ignorant, disinterested cops are the only weak link in Ebbe Roe Smith's otherwise tight screenplay (you might remember him as 'Jim Bob' in Fletch Lives). Creating stupid characters to further the drama is just too easy, and every time one of them speaks it really drags the movie down.Joel Schumacher's career has been filled with ups and downs (Batman and Robin certainly ain't one of the 'ups'), but Falling Down proves that he can be a good director when he wants to, regardless of how wildly inconsistent his track record is. James Newton Howard also contributes a nice score (which has never been released), but really this is Douglas' film. He's often funny without even meaning to be. D-Fens is just speaking his mind, but still his views come across as controversial or intolerant. If only more people had the courage to take a stand against injustice in real life instead of 'just dealing with it'.Idiot cop characters aside, Falling Down is one of Douglas's best, and perhaps more relevant now than it was in 1993.",Falling Down
44,ironhorse_iv,I had fallen for Falling Down. It's one of my favorite films of the 1990s.,8,30 April 2017,"We've all had bad days. And oftentimes, a day that starts out horrible just keeps getting worse, snowballing into a really awful day. This is how 1993's crime thriller, 'Falling Down' begins. Directed by Joel Schumacher & taken place on, one of the hottest days in Los Angeles, California's history; the film written by Ebbe Roe Smith, the film tells the story of an defense worker, William Foster (Michael Douglas) trying to get home for his daughter's birthday party, only to get frustrated with the various flaws he sees in society, which starts to unravel him, until he suffer from a major to psychotically and violently unstable mental breakdown. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, that, the English Hard Rock Band, Iron Maiden got it right with this man. He was truly on the edge, with each step gets closer to losing his head. Even if, we can't condone his extreme actions, as least, some of us, can relate to the issues, he had to deal with. Everybody, at least, had one of these days. If you can't relate to his struggles, as least, you can understand, the frustrations that Det. Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall), had to deal with on his last day on the force on figuring out the mystery, who is this madman, is all about. Both of these character's stories, make 'Falling Down', a very intriguing, yet challenging movie, worth watching. Added to that, is the wonderful use of music by James Newton Howard that set the mood, and powerful visual cinematography from Andrzej Bartkowiak under Schumacher's direction. Sunny LA has never look, so bleak and hopeless, before. Great use of desaturated and low tech camera-work and shooting at rundown locations. Also great use of symbolism and metaphors throughout the film, like the running use of the lyrics of 'London Bridge' & others. However, I do have to say, the film isn't with some faults & I'm not talking about the minor nitpicking goofs. I'm talking about how the film was notorious criticize by critics at the time, for its treatment of minorities; mostly with how they show Korean and Latino Americans as thugs. It got so bad, that Warner Brothers canceled the release of 'Falling Down' in South Korea & certain Latin America countries following boycott threats. In my opinion, while I can understand the reasons, why minorities groups like Korean & Latino American Coalition got anger. After all, the film was made, during and released just after the 1992 Los Angeles Riot where Koreans and Latinos were targeted by police and looters. In truth, there was plenty of positive, Hispanic & Asian Americans characters in the film, like Detective Brian (Steve Park) & Detective Sandra Torres (Rachel Ticotin). Both characters were played by Korean and Latina performers. If anything, if you look at the majority of negatively characters, throughout the film. Most of them, were portray with white actors. Plus, as a minority, the portrayal weren't as bad, as people back then, make it out to be. Compare to other films back then, it's pretty tame. I just think, these groups are just missing the point. The film is trying to tackle the struggles, of trying to get along, despite cultural differences, language as well, as the economic conditions, in which, many of us, Americans, lived under. Honestly, if there is any real faults for this film, it wouldn't be their use of harsh-language & violence; if anything, it would be, due to the fact, that the film couldn't stop itself, being label as the negative 'angry white racism man' movie. While, on the surface, the film might look like the stereotypically disproportionally portrayal of an older White Americans, having animosity toward minorities; in truth, the film is nothing like that. We sees, throughout the film, William Foster getting along with a number of minorities. Some good examples are the 'Under Construction' scene, where a young unnamed black kid (Valentino Harrison) teach him, how to use a bazooka and the scene with the not economically viable man (Vondie Curtis-Hall). There is even, a scene where Foster disagree with a Neo-Nazi Surplus Store Owner (Frederic Forrest) about race. Because of that, I can't say, Foster is a racism character, nor can I say the movie glorifies lawbreaking. Of course, we see many elements of our society that contributed to his madness. However, the movie never condones his actions as the right thing to do. He's never the hero. If anything, Robert Duvall's character, is. Despite that, I do have to say, portrayal Foster is probably the best role, Michael Douglas has done, since 1987's 'Wall Street'. You really do see, the unbalance nature of his character, trying to figure out, what is right and what is wrong in a world that he views is upside down. You see his alienation, disgust and mounting rage against what he perceives to be an increasingly unfair and depersonalized world. However, I can't say, the same with Robert Duvall's character. His performance was a bit, too similar to the role, he played in 1988's 'Colors'; still interesting, but in the end, he really didn't stand out as much as Douglas does. After all, Douglas's character inspired the creation of the one-episode character Frank Grimes from The Simpsons 23th episode ""Homer's Enemy,"" on Season 8 and received a parodic homage song in Foo Fighters' video for ""Walk"". In the end, the dark comedy of this movie really does payoff; both tragedy and humorous. Either way, it's a film that inspires quite a bit of discussion and debate. That's one thing, I love about this movie. It makes you think. Depending on who you ask, this film is either social commentary on the dangers of capitalism, and the ignorance of the citizen under it or the call to arms for conservatism against the dangers of liberalism. All these arguments have merit and it could be any of this. That's why, this is one movie that is worth seeing.",Falling Down

48,johnnyboyz,"By the looks and sounds of things, it isn't just London Bridge that's Falling Down.",7,15 June 2013,"Few seem to be enjoying their time in Falling Down's version of California, the arid; bustling and multicultural zone that is Los Angeles, furthermore located within the state that provides America with its film making HQ in Hollywood, doesn't come off as the nicest place in the world - indeed, you couldn't find an American film much further away from what Hollywood produce than Falling Down. But Joel Schumacher's film is about more than petty revisionism, for it is a piece depicting a white man in a Western metropolis losing their minds amidst a place seemingly ravaged by foreign policy; multi-ethnical congregation and crooked economic thinking and of which has led him to be where he is as certain others, perhaps less entitled to what they've got, thrive. Alongside Mike Leigh's film ""Naked"" from the same year, Falling Down is compulsory viewing as a film depicting a series of vignettes and altercations between a lone, unhinged lead and those of whom he encounters as he trawls his way through a place you probably think you know through that outlet we call 'popular culture', but whose true face here strikes us as a lot less than what is pleasant. The approach, often limited to that of films from Africa; the Middle East and Latin America, allows the screenwriter to weave their protagonist down a series of alley ways encompassing the political feeling; the false economy and racial segregation apparent in of one of the most recognisable cities of the Western world. In short, it works an absolute treat. Schumacher places us into the mind-set of his lead during the opening sequence, a traffic jam on a busy freeway in sweltering L.A. conditions as canted angles and preoccupations with unpleasant, annoying things force us to view the world from a very specific standpoint. In there amongst the noise; the flies and the road works holding everybody up is Michael Douglas' character: a perfectly nondescript guy, although whose image through popular culture since has rendered his image anything but ordinary, that sports a short haircut; glasses; a blank, white shirt and an innocuous black briefcase to go with an everyday build. The epitome of white, working class Europe and America who're burrowing away in their middle-age, we have our lead in William Foster. Cracking under the conditions, Foster ups and leaves his car stranded in its lane for the nether regions that greet the patron who so dares navigate that territory just to the sides of a motorway. His reply to one driver's perplexity at the situation reveals that he's ""going home"", but he is going home to a family that's later revealed to have already been broken by him in the past. Some duality is established through Foster's foil for the film, Robert Duvall's police officer Martin Prendergast; an elderly law enforcer on the brink of retirement whose reaction to everything in that very same traffic jam is to merely curse and get on with it. Here is a man whose reaction is to chuckle at some graffiti on an overhead billboard more-so condemn it as an item synonymous with the collapse of society. It will come to pass that, like Foster, Prendergast too is just trying to get home; to get home after a long time spent doing what he does and to get home to a domestic set up poles apart from Foster's on top of his very different reaction to the opening hold up.The meat of the piece is Foster's stylised rampage through the streets, parks and turfs of Los Angeles; a place wherein one is nary too far away from a Latino punk, a homosexual, a white supremacist or a con artist who's ploy to do what they do in a busy public area in broad daylight with the minimum of respect is one of the more disturbing sequences in a film that's already featured vandalism and gun crime. One such sequence sees Foster, quite literally, dismantle Capitalism in its purest physical form when he takes a baseball bat to a store owned by an immigrant seeking the American dream as well as its supplies therein. This is on account of everything costing so much more than when Foster was a child. Later on, the collapse of education and the general fallout of the relationship children have with their elders is depicted in a scene when Foster recalls how referring to someone more advanced in life as ""sir"" is the cultural norm, a view that a pair of Latin American thugs do not share. Foster's encountering of inter-racial segregation; Capitalism run amok, as foreign aid does so additionally, and a complete loss of respect plaguing society as a whole fuels this strand of causality aggression; provocation and regression. Its culmination, on a 'bubbled' golf course, as those affluent enough to shroud everything out in spite of the fact most of them are probably responsible for it, would be a lot funnier if it didn't ring so painfully true. Set away from Douglas' episodic spree is Prendergast's piecing together of said thing, a relief if your politics do not sync up with that of Douglas' character's and certainly a strand with more of a backbone, from a classical film-making angle, if clues; progression and a general sense of unfolding narrative are the characteristics you use to define such a thing. Schumacher builds a wonderful atmosphere out of the little things, the notion that Prendergast is on the cusp of leaving his job; the idea that gunshot wounds are commonplace in his chosen career and the sense we get of how utterly devastated his wife would be should such a thing happen becomes more and more apparent thus aiding this coiled feeling about things.

49,Fella_shibby,Since when did the average hard working middle class person became the bad guy?,10,7 October 2018,"I first saw this in the mid 90s on a vhs. Revisited it recently on a blu-ray.
I thoroughly enjoyed viewing this again after so many years.
This movie is still relevant today no matter which country u belong to.
Michael Douglas' hypnotic performance is the highlight of this film. Everything about him, from his half sleeve plain white shirt, to his briefcase, his lunch, his specs and his torn shoes all screamed average middle class.
The best line of the film is when Douglas asks Duvall, I am the bad guy?I don't know but I was laughing my guts out while viewing this film. The guy who played the neo Nazi is creepy n hilarious. The cosmetic surgeon's house scene, the golf ground scene, the burger scene n the store scene, I found all these scenes darkly comical.
Douglas' middle class person act is mind blowing. He potrayed the character who has to go thru everyday nuances very well. Working hard still ain't able to purchase a house, non payment of rent, road n traffic issues, employment issues, etc.
The effect of consumerism has on each of us is dealt with properly in this film.
The funny part is that the rich doesn't care about inflation or monetary probs, the poor gets government n ngo's aid while the middle class is stuck between em like a sandwich.
The government doesn't care about him, they care about vote banks and that lies within the poor community.",Falling Down

51,videorama-759-859391,"A powerfully, wonderfully shot film, anything but falling",9,17 January 2016,"This is a near great film. How cool is this cool guided film, led by a stellar performance by Douglas, in still one of his best roles. Falling Down just doesn't touch on the frailty of a man, whose finally had enough and cracked, but other things like ethics, economy, and anti gay themes (the great Frederic Forrest, in his homo phobic gun trigger role) to name a few, are wonderfully exemplified. But also the movie also it has a realness in it's characters, who Douglas encounters, en route to his destination, that being of his split wife, and daughter, on her third birthday. Not all the people Douglas encounters, are pleasant, but they're all real people, not fictional in the sense of being unreal, and aren't over the top, although the young sickly smiling waitress, really adds to the term, happy meal. We've all been there; we're finally had enough, and want to kill, the only difference, Douglas takes it beyond that, that ends in such a a tragic and sad climax, similar to that of Thelma and Louise, cause these are all heroes. From the first reel, in wonderfully captured close ups, we feel what Douglas feels, and can't wait to go and this journey. Bill Forster (an ordinary and kind of creepy looking Douglas, with short prickly hair) vacates his car in hectic mid morning traffic, causing quite a traffic bottleneck. It's so interesting, how the story and situations, realistically follow, and anytime Douglas is on the screen, he's engaging. Now slowly connecting the dots, veteran cop Duvall (in one of his best roles) on his day of retirement, works this last, out of the ordinary domestic-call it what you will, to track this crazy down, alongside his younger partner, Ticotin, really showing female power. Personally, some of Douglas's victims, are righteous kills, where there was quite some egging on moments, for me. F.D. really plays out realistically, something more than a movie, with potent and admirable statements, insightful too, for it's realities and views, not just by Douglas. The arrogant, uncaring, road worker, made me sick. A fattened up Tuesday Weld is fantastic as Duvall's unstable wife, where that punch out was gratefully warranted. Falling Down is something of a jewel of movie, but it's a electrifying movie experience, representing with moral and social issues, you should experience, just once.",Falling Down
52,Polaris_DiB,Railing and ranting and shooting away,8,14 August 2008,"Move over, homosexuality... step aside, mother love... the new id is the frustrated spectator of societal decay we've all become when chained to our cars, separated from our loved ones, and forced into working menial jobs until something. just. snaps.""Falling Down"" is one of those movies that just comes out of nowhere. It has a familiar place on most retail shelves, but isn't often mentioned. I myself had never heard anyone talk about it until someone recommended it to me roughly about a week ago. It's early Schumacher, coming out some time before he ruined the Batman franchise, and it seems like one of his little secrets, only there for those who find it word of mouth.Starting with a less surreal take-off of the opening scene of ""8 1/2"", ""Falling Down"" follows a new day in the life of D-fens, a white collar man who decides in the middle of a traffic jam to play hookey, only to find himself suddenly seeing the decay around him with a little more clarity. At first he simply rants and raves and attempts to get a breath of fresh air, but as he continually finds himself under pressure (and habitually gains access to more and more weapons), his personal momentum builds into a violent and scathing criticism of everything that gets in his way--which covers many facets of society, luckily enough.Believe me, there's some catharsis to be felt from this one. Ever gone to McDonalds and just wanted a McMuffin, but arrived five minutes too late for the breakfast menu? Watch this movie, it'll help you feel better. Ever wanted to put both gangsters and rich country club yuppies in their place? Watch this movie, it'll make you feel fine. Ever wanted to believe you could turn your mundane life into ""going out in a blaze of glory""? Well, if you relate enough to this guy, you might just be the type to snap, too.Michael Douglas' performance helps a lot. What could be a twisted and schlocky movie becomes endearingly personal and tragic with Douglas' mopey face. Robert Duvall plays a nice counterpoint as the policeman who, like D-fens, always played by the rules, but whose stress is eventually making him question the logic of following the system. And scattered throughout are some rather brilliant single moments of epiphany as D-fens rants about the minor things that make society so frustrating, from disgusting cheeseburgers to inflation to questioning the point of most construction.I will admit there's some ways in which I don't agree with this film, for instance his taking his rage out on some of the smaller workers who probably don't really care for their jobs in the first place. The retail employee in me cringes when I think of how over-used ""The Customer Is Always Right!"" and ""What About My Consumer Rights!"" are for means of bringing a stressed out, semi-paranoid, frustrated person into a public rant. D-fens constantly rails against the lack of caring and personalization in service as one of the many chips in society's glossy facade, but in a way its the very convenience he craves that has led to a major lack of interpersonal connection. My thing is, if you don't want the hamburger, then don't pay for it and don't eat it--but whatever you do, don't pull out a gun on minimum wage workers, they have crappy lives anyway.Nevertheless, this movie comes from a very strong place and has a lot to say about the various levels in which we've all fallen out of sync. For those looking for a somewhat more violent, massively darker ""Office Space"", ""Falling Down"" is that movie to unwind with after having a very, very long day. Just let the catharsis be a relief, not an example.--PolarisDiB",Falling Down

His farewell party is a perfunctory affair enlivened only when someone makes a derogatory remark about Mrs Prendergast and is knocked down for his pains. Meanwhile,across an arid and sun-bleached L.A, landscape not unlike that in ""Assault on Pct 13"" William Foster,keen to get to his estranged daughter's birthday party is stuck in a traffic jam.He abandons his car and sets off on foot.Wanting some change to call his wife he goes into a convenience store and gets involved in a violent altercation with the owner.William,armed with a baseball bat strides off determinedly all unknowing that he has entered the turf of a street gang.He beats up two of them who try to rob him and the is the target of an attempted drive-by that this particularly inept gang screw up as well.Pausing only to shoot a dying gang member in the leg he makes off with a gym bag full of guns.Feeling peckish he stops at a fast food outlet where he enlivens everyone's day by firing through the ceiling in a fit of pique.Figuring that by now the police might be looking for him(good thinking)he pops into a survival store,not unlike the one where Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames underwent a life-changing experience in ""Pulp Fiction"")to by some fresh clothes.The owner is harassing a couple of gays just so's we know right from the get-go that he's a nazi.Prendergast's ex-partner comes into the store for him but the nazi hides him and is rude to her(sexist as well as homophobic,the dog).He and William quarrel and we feel he is about to get his cherry popped when he murders the nazi and escapes.Prendergast is by now on the case. After several more Homeric episodes Foster get's to his ex's house one step behind her and her daughter and one step in front of Prendergast's ex-partner whom he shoots.Their is a dramatic confrontation on the pier,then Foster,feeling it is all up for him(good thinking again) pulls his daughter's water pistol on Sergeant Prendergast,who,not having a water pistol of his own is obliged to blast him off the end of the pier.He then walks away,presumably to a life of misery with a nagging alcoholic wife.He would have been better off letting William squirt water all over him.I've seen scarier episodes of ""Heartbeat"". ""Falling Down"" is widely regarded as a racist gore fest,but some people see racism in ""Noddy and BigEars"".William Foster isn't racist,he hates everybody.He buys a present for his daughter from a Muslim street trader shows no animosity towards black people over white,a funny sort of racist if you ask me.He only kills one person,and that in self defence.

54,dee.reid,My thoughts on Falling Down,10,29 October 2000,"Falling Down stars Michael Douglas as a stressed-out military defense worker who early in film is seen caught in a traffic jam.  Distracted by honking horns, rowdy kids, a buzzing fly, and lord knows what else that's annoying, he finally decides to get out of his car and walk the rest of the way home. On his way out another motorist ask,""Where are you going?"" and Michael Douglas simply replies,""I'm going home.""  At this point we know that he is not an ordinary man.  On his journey home, he encounters a selfish stork clerk, who refuses to give him change to make a phone call, and the scene ends with Michael getting pissed at the clerk and he begins smashing up everything.  Also while on his way, he encounters gang members, a neo-nazi surplus store clerk, a restaurant that won't to serve him breakfast, despite the fact that they had just stopped serving it about 3 minutes ago, snobbish golfers and numerous other hassles that Michael sees as ""unjustly.""  He soon enough begins lashing out at these unjustly hassles in unfriendly and sometimes psychotic ways.  Joel Schumacher who also directed The Lost Boys and the awful Batman and Robin directs Falling Down with perfection.  The ending, in my opinion, was the perfect ending to a perfect film.  Falling Down gets a 10/10 from me because it shows an imperfect man living in an imperfect world.",Falling Down
55,drqshadow-reviews,"Douglas is a Man Out of Time, Not to Mention Patience, in This Simmering Revenge Fantasy",5,26 December 2017,"Michael Douglas plays a working-class man, pushed over the edge by the stress of modern life, family problems, work difficulties and a whole slew of mental issues. He's basically on the warpath from the beginning, storming away from a traffic standstill to find (or instigate) a frothy, furious conflict with every step. Douglas's unnamed vigilante might play as somewhat sympathetic at first, or perhaps that was the intention, but as the climax approaches and more details are filled in, he's among the last to realize that he isn't this story's hero. Robert Duvall works a parallel route as the desk-bound former police detective, trying to get through his last day, who almost unconsciously cracks the case and throws himself into harm's way. There's a lot of subtlety and context here, which seems lost in Joel Schumacher's hammy, literal direction. Duvall's coworkers tease him relentlessly about dying before retirement, an obvious crack at the well-worn cinematic trope, but it plays as dumb and blunt rather than witty and clever. The rampaging madman is treated with strange admiration, marching through a hail of bullets like a superhero where he should have seemed detached and unhinged. I don't think Schumacher completely understood the story he was telling. With an excellent leading performance from Douglas and a sharp, surprisingly relevant script, it's a shame this didn't turn out better than it did.",Falling Down
56,MBunge,Proving Joel Schumacher is NOT history's greatest monster,7,18 July 2011,"Many people have said many nasty things about Joel Schumacher for what he did to Batman on the big screen. Every single one of them has been entirely deserved. But those insults should be softened with just a little praise for making a bold urban nightmare like this film.Falling Down is the story of a man who is stuck in traffic one day when his tolerance for the world is finally used up. Identified only by his license plate ""D-Fens"", the man (Michael Douglas) abandons his car and starts walking. He says he's going home, but where he's going isn't his home anymore. His ex-wife Beth and daughter Adele (Barbara Hershey and Joey Hope Singer) now live there and Beth has a restraining order against D-Fens. As he walks his way across Los Angeles, D-Fens has a series of violent encounters, first with the everyday aggravations of life in the big city. From busting up the shop of a immigrant merchant who speaks broken English to confronting some gang bangers to a gun point rant against the unctuous martinets at a fast food restaurant, D-Fens eventually graduates to more brutal acts against more existential frustrations like neo-Nazi gun nuts, pointless road construction and the vicious sense of entitlement among the wealthy. All the while, getting every closer to Beth and Adele.As reports of D-Fens' slow moving rampage come in, the only one to figure out what's going on is a cop spending his last day on the job. Detective Prendergast (Robert Duvall) is retiring early, an taking a reduced pension, to satisfy the demands of his insecure, needy and somewhat unstable wife. Aided by the only cop he's friends with (Rachel Ticotin), Prendergast sets out to stop D-Fens before this day turns out to be the last day in the life of a lot of people.Falling Down is a smart film that takes on two cultural phenomena of the early 1990s. One is the concept of ""going postal"", where relatively normal men started going into their workplaces and shooting people. The other is the sense of economic disenfranchisement that came out of the recession that bridges the first Bush and Clinton Administrations. Now granted, as befitting a Joel Schumacher picture, this movie doesn't take those subjects on with any subtlety. But it does address them thoroughly with both empathy and honesty.Schumacher, Michael Douglas and screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith combine to make D-Fens a character who defies easy definition. He's neither the righteous vigilante of right wing fantasies nor a liberal's easily dismissed symbol of white male intolerance. He's a man who can legitimately claim he's been victimized by society, yet he's also a man whose seething rage terrifies the ones closest to him. Most of the carnage he creates is accidental or without malice, yet his ultimate goal is the darkest sort of evil. D-Fens is someone you cannot completely embrace or reject. You can only wonder how much of yourself is reflected in him.The whole film is somewhat like that. Most of the characters, even minor ones, are given depth and personalities like they're real human beings and not just constructs serving the script. They experience genuine humor and friendship and anguish and fear in a way this sort of high-concept movie usually doesn't provide.The contrast between D-Fens and Prendergast that runs through the story is a great example of that kind of complexity. They're both guys whose lives aren't working out like they wanted. One has a failed marriage and a lost career, the other a dead daughter and a crazy wife he feels responsible for. The ways they deal with those challenges are quite different. D-Fens is an idealist who cares about the way he thinks things should be, at the expense of the other people in the world with him. Prendergast is a pragmatist who takes the world as it is and does what he has to do to get by, without even thinking it could be any other way.I suspect that Falling Down has not gotten the acclaim it deserves because it's a mainstream work of entertainment that won't fit neatly into a particular box. It looks and sounds like a white male power trip, but it feels much more introspective and melancholy and despairing. I find it to be a compelling story with some great acting and I think you should give it a look.",Falling Down
57,smatysia,"Douglas, Duvall, and Ticotin make a film worth seeing.",8,1 December 2001,"An interesting and fairly courageous choice of role for Michael Douglas after his big hit in ""Basic Instinct"". He finds a way to get the audience to root for a fairly unlikeable character, and one that the audience knows little about, not even his name. Even further into the film when there is some exposition about ""D-FENS"" you still want him to win, even though you start to see that his madness and rage has been building for some time.
Robert Duvall turns in an excellent performance, as always. And I had forgotten how beautiful and charming Rachel Ticotin is. I will have to dig up some of her other films.This movie is at least a bit of a deviation from the basic Hollywood formula. (Except maybe the ending.) I didn't notice the direction at any time during the film, and this is high praise for Joel Schumacher.
One more note. I fail to see how people could consider this film racist. Only the race-baiting leftists of the P.C. police would think that you could make this film any other way. Does anyone deny that it might be a little dangerous for a nerdy white guy to go wandering about through South Central, or numerous other Los Angeles neighborhoods? You may say it's a stereotype, but most stereotypes have some basis in truth. That's how they become stereotypes. Duh.Anyway, I think this is a pretty good film. Grade: B+",Falling Down
58,jimbo-53-186511,"Michael Douglas is excellent, but Falling Down's lack of depth is what really holds it back",5,17 January 2016,"Michael Douglas plays the role of D-Fens here who is on his way to see his child and his estranged ex-wife. His day doesn't start out great as he finds himself held up in traffic and decides after a while that 'enough is enough' and abandons his car in the middle of a traffic jam. This is merely the tip of the iceberg however and 'D-Fens' become more and more irate as he continually encounters people that rub him up the wrong way when he is merely trying to get back home to see his daughter. As time progresses, D-Fens behaviour becomes more erratic, unpredictable and dangerous and officer Prendergast (Robert Duvall) on his last day on the force makes it his mission to stop D-Fens as quickly as possible.Had this film been handled better then it could have been an excellent character study. I got the impression here that D-Fens was intended to be somebody that we can identify with and relate to but for me these aspects of the story didn't really come together too well mainly for two reasons;1) THE STORY - Initially it starts out well and some of the plot elements are believable - nobody likes being stuck in traffic and yes I'm sure we all have days where we'd love to abandon our cars in the middle of a traffic jam. I think the most believable scenario in this film is where D-Fens tries to order breakfast a few minutes after the cut off time and is told that he needs to get something from the lunch menu. The first thing that came to my head was 'Jobsworth' and D-Fens frustration here is understandable even if his behaviour is not. Where it fell apart for me was when D-Fens stole the guns from the gangsters and went on his killing spree - it felt like a slight overstep to me as it was possible to feel some sympathy for and relate to D-Fens up to this point. Now to the second major problem with this film; 2) D-FENS CHARACTER - My understanding is that this was intended as a character study and perhaps the point here was to give an insight into how a series of everyday problems can cause a potentially unbalanced individual to snap. The problem with this film is that it never attempts to really explain D-Fens behaviour and doesn't bother offering much of an insight into his mind or thought process. Mental Health Issues are thrown around now and again, but the filmmakers never really attempt to explain D-Fens behaviour. I'm not normally a fan of voiceovers, but I do think that it might have been beneficial here just to try to gain more of an understanding of the protagonist.Falling Down is perhaps worth watching once but only really for Michael Douglas. He puts in an excellent performance here where he very much plays against type and it's a pity that his character wasn't given the depth needed to make this a great film. When the film ended I couldn't help but feel that Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver had more depth and gave a much better insight into the mind of a crazed and disaffected individual.",Falling Down
59,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Michael Douglas is mad as hell and he's not going to take it anymore,7,10 June 2017,"Everyone's had the moment where they're at the absolute end of their rope and feel like taking drastic or violent action against whatever is grinding your gears. Whether it's a hot day in horrendous rush hour traffic, a particularly irritating lineup at Starbucks or an especially dense customer service worker, you just feel like saying 'screw it', and decimating the place with anything you can lay your hands on. In Joel Schumacher's Falling Down, Michael Douglas does just that on a sweltering LA summer day. His character, who remains nameless save for the moniker 'D-Fens', is a business man on his way home who just snaps. Throwing a tantrum on the LA overpass, he quickly loses it, arms himself with a high velocity shotgun and proceeds to vet out every mundane annoyance, pet peeve and irksome scenario he can find. Whether it's brutal catharsis he's looking for, a cure for the doldrums of daily life or simply raging against that emptiness we all feel deep down, he keeps his reasons to himself, and let's every other aspect of his character run wild. Holding up a fast food joint because they stopped serving breakfast five minutes too early, massacring homeless punks who foolishly harass him, his crusade sprawls across the valley and beyond, a righteous purge of monotonous, infuriating trivial concerns that soon has the attention of LA's finest in the form of veteran Detective Robert Duvall and his crass, obnoxious lieutenant (Raymond J. Barry). It's also revealed that Douglas's personal life leading up to his break was rocky at best, with a job going downhill and hints of violence towards his wife and daughter. Quite drastic is the meltdown though, but it's not quite a character study, he's almost used more to pick away at the decays in society, a tool for exposing tears in the cloth we take for granted every day. His story is kind of like when you load up Grand Theft Auto on your console and completely ignore the missions in favour of a personalized war on anything that moves. His war happens to be against those little nagging inconveniences that seem like no biggie until they add up and you just go postal. It's darkly funny stuff, but quite harrowing when you look at the big picture and the actual damage he's doing to the city. Douglas is courageous here, it takes reckless abandon to go for a role like this, and he owns it in crew cut, well dressed fashion, a costume choice that absurdly clashes with the big metal cannon he totes. The film never takes sides either, recognizing both the bizarre consumerist nightmare we wade through everyday and it's ability to dampen your spirit as well as the sickening extremes he goes to, challenging you to walk a line and look at both sides. Hard hitting stuff.",Falling Down

Something very different from director Joel Schumacher, something we would have perhaps expected to see in the hands of Oliver Stone, with his no nonsense, hard hitting approach. Schumacher's films are very diverse though, and include ""St.Elmo's Fire"", ""Dying Young"" and ""Flatliners"".This time our director has tackled the issue of the way society is today. Michael Douglas is 'D-Fens', a man who decides he cannot stand the way things have become, both in the world and in his own life, and so he decides to take action, and I mean action! ""Falling Down"" is a violent film which tries to comment on society's 'illnesses'. Sadly our hero resorts to all out war to make his point, and this of course solves nothing.The actual plot of the movie (which regards 'D-Fens' trek across LA to see his estranged wife and daughter) is the real base of the story, however it only serves as a distraction from the real issue.Michael Douglas returns to top form in an unaccustomed and menacing role, and is ably supported by Robert Duvall, Barbara Hershey, Rachel Ticotin and Tuesday Weld. The music (James Newton Howard) and cinematography also work well.""Falling Down"" does expose the dark side of humanity well, and shows that the world we live in is not a good one, while still pointing out that combating violence with violence is futile. Unfortunately it offers few answers, and one cannot sympathise with a lead character who so quickly becomes that which he despises.

The whole scene with Douglas in the fast food restaurant was priceless, giving a voice to the typical angry consumer.

In ""Falling Down"", Michael Douglas has brought to life one of the most believable, likeable, and disturbing antiheroes of all time. It's a poignant tale of the everyman finally getting sick of the various stupidities, banalities, and irritabilities (I'm coining that if it's not already a word) that plague our modern life. It's a film that, at the beginning is as hilarious as it is true, but as the film continues, it proceeds to become more real, more disturbing, but also more grounded in its message. It's ridiculous and insane, but it also cuts deep to the truths that all of us feel at times.
I've seen a number of Joel Schumacher's films, but this is the only one I could imagine myself watching multiple times. It depicts the American dream better than most films out there. It shows the everyman's struggle to conquer what he believes is wrong. It gives us a person to root for who is idealistic and filled with bravado, but also a man who is seriously flawed. I really believe this picture was ahead of its time; it didn't get incredible reviews, but I'd argue it's Joel Schumacher's crowning achievement.",Falling Down

It is a brilliant film combining both an exciting thriller (with small amounts of action), blistering satire and social commentary, and laugh out loud funny moments. It is an intimate drama of one man's breakdown and the cop (on his last day before retirement) who has to find and deal with him, it is also epic with Los Angeles acting as the third major character. Perfect pacing and direction from Joel Schumacher, with special mention to James Newton Howard for a score which compliments the film wonderfully. Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall both brilliant actors, do this film justice, Michael Douglas is absolutely believable as the every-man worker, and Robert Duvall compliments Douglas' more showy performance with an understated one of the put-upon policeman.Michael Douglas's performance in this film was brilliant and makes it memorable. The cop who is looking for Foster has his own personal problems as well, reacting to those problems in a very different way though. There are many humorous scenes as well, due to Douglas's acting. The movie does really well at showing how frustrated Foster is and that he has really had enough of everything. All the way through it is tense and sets the tone right at the beginning with a really gripping and well made opening. The film is excellent on many levels and the atmosphere is well captured, having a sense of fear throughout. The opening scene in which we see Douglas trapped in the traffic jam is extremely well presented and really sets the heat and frustration levels of the movie from the beginning. Other scenes in the film are equally as stunning and have almost become legend in film history. The scene in the Burger Bar is simply stunning and it is scenes like this where the viewer actually cheers for Douglas as he performs all the stunts we would like to in our own real worlds! The final confrontation is very effective and clearly shows the difference in the two characters. The film makes you think about society and to keep tempers under control even if the world is ""Falling Down."" Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Falling Down
68,eric262003,Good Acting Over Poor Direction,7,25 January 2011,"Joel Schumacher has built a notoriety for making potentially amazing movies and turning them into mush. Look what he did in ""Batman Returns"" by making the Batsuit look like car rugs sewn together. Not to completely chastise him, he can be a really good director if he wanted to, but his failures seem to get the best of him and catches him off guard. ""Falling Down"" had tons of potential to captivate its audience as an eye-catching drama with plenty of commentary for good measure. And it succeeds in that spectrum thanks mostly to Schumacher, but with the help of the always impressive Michael Douglas during the first two-thirds of this movie. Douglas' perspective stands true to today's economy that even the rising price of a can of soda can raise angst among society as a whole. His frustration on the golf course represents shows how much he sympathizes the lower-class people in society. Up until, ""Falling Down"" have we ever seen Douglas annihilate a phone booth and that's when the movie bone's the fish. By shooting stuff for no real purpose is when we discover the film has lost its spunk.And so, as Douglas rants about the negativity of society, these comments become very random or sever the viewer's minds with it obviousness. Going back to the golf course scene, this would've been the best scene in the movie had Schumacher prevented Douglas from making a mockery of himself with unnecessary preachy diatribes. Ever since special effects came into prominence in movies, Hollywood has never mastered the skills of subtlety. Every problem in movies can be resolved with just a large dose of violence and hostility. It's as if they think the audience will buy into it. Like we're all a bunch of idiots. And so I say that ""Falling Down"" is strong in entertainment value and a film that anyone can enjoy. The Achilles Heel in this movie is that the ending didn't live up to its promise from its outstanding beginning. Too bad because as long as Schumacher is at the helm, he'll continue to make movies that builds on momentum with a disappointing outcome in the end.",Falling Down
69,Sandcooler,Now you're going to die,9,16 November 2009,"He's right! The lunatic with the machine gun is right! It's not an uncommon feeling to have while watching this movie. The man can't catch a break, everything is out to get him, from street gangs to Nazis to overpriced soda. All he wants to do is get home, unfortunately he's held back by his restraining order. Talk about bad luck. What will he do next, you never know but it's safe to assume that it will be incredibly bad-ass. The ""Whammy Burger"" scene is too awesome to put into words, and the same goes for the scene where he walks up to a golfer who tries to take him out with a ball. Which angries him tremendously. The scenes with the police inspector inspecting stuff are a little less interesting, but they work up to a truly brilliant climax, which is both witty and saddening at the same time. The home video sequence really is beautiful. I'm quite fond of this movie.",Falling Down
70,philip_vanderveken,"He does what you always wanted to do, but never dared.",8,12 September 2004,"Falling down is a great movie, no matter what some people think of it. I just loved it. In this movie we see Michael Douglas as an ordinary man who appears to be someone who is, in his mind, still living in the sixtees, when everything was better... The people were nicer, the prices lower,... even his hairstyle and his clothing come right of this time period.He has to go to work, standing with his car in a traffic jam. His airconditioning broke down, he can't open his windows, he gets annoyed by a fly in his car and by what is happening around him... Don't we all know the feeling sometimes? And than it happens, something snaps in his head and he steps out of his car. He leaves his car, saying that he's ""going home"". On his way home he meets all kinds of people who annoy him for one reason or another. When they don't get out of his way soon enough he responds in a violent way, even though he isn't really a violent man.When you see this movie you will probably sympathize with the guy. You see that he's having a hard time. And last but not least, he does what you always wanted to do, but never dared. Perhaps that is where the strength of this movie can be found in. You can feel one with Michael Douglas' character. To me this movie is worth an 8/10. Really good work.",Falling Down
71,screenman,Killing Deadbeat Dads,5,15 December 2010,"Yes; it's that perennial Hollwood theme and endless cause of feminist recrimination - the deadbeat dad.But there's more.Micheal Douglas plays the role of a man in the middle. He's middle-aged, middle-class, and in the middle of a frightful nervous breakdown.His employment prospects have slipped down the pan. His marriage has followed it. Yet both of these things prove transient for many people. However; like many good, kindly men and willing fathers; thanks to that relentless bigotry of feminism, even the best are treated as if they're the worst. After all; they're male, aren't they? When I first sat to watch this movie, I assumed I was going to see a black comedy about an ordinary Joe who got pushed beyond his limit and began rebelling against the expected subjugation of his goodwill. A sort of 'Reginald Perrin' with attitude. And that's certainly how the story begins. We see this schmuck trapped by the vicissitudes of modern life on a sweltering-hot day, begin ignoring the acculturated fences and start cutting a swathe through problems and inconveniences in a fashion that has most of us envying his grit and self-will, and cheering his disregard of conventionality.But this is Hollywood, and such heroes can only exist in comedy. If rebellion became truly idealised - well...what then? The comfortable status quo would be subverted, and that would never do. Men might even begin to demand equal treatment. Outrageous.This man's anarchic responses take a progressively more confrontational turn as the evident balance of his mind tilts towards mental illness. Partway through his aberrant career, a retiring police-officer (ho-hum, yawn) is alerted and a manhunt begins.From this point on, the story degenerates into a predictable, formulaic piece of misandric trash. Basically; he's not just a guy who has had everything taken away and fighting back; he's a murderous ex-husband on a mission of lethal revenge against his former wife, with whom the anti-male state has conspired to deprive him of all he has valued. There's only one solution then. It's inevitable. You can see it coming from that point on.If the movie had been intelligent, it could have shown the history of his tragic decline - perhaps by back-flashes - and developed a sensitive (though improbable) denouement in reconciliation. But the makers weren't up for sympathetic backfill or honorable reprieve. This man was just a dead-beat dad who was earmarked for death. Plain and sickeningly simple.Every player acquits themselves well. The technical issues are all up to snuff. Still I came away with nothing but contempt for this movie, its makers, and the ingrained misandric intolerance it continues to propagate.",Falling Down

73,Luigi Di Pilla,ONE OF THE BEST PSYCHO-DRAMA-THRILLER EVER MADE,8,16 November 2002,It´s no doubt one of the best movies of Michael Douglas. He delivers a strong performance and also Robert Duvall was great. Perhaps it is even for director Joel Schumacher the most successful film he made. This dramatic psycho-thriller offers many plots and laughs. I already watched it twice on DVD and I will keep it in my best of DVD collection. I highly recommend it to everyone! Don´t miss it.

75,seymourblack-1,A Spectacular Breakdown,9,30 September 2011,"In ""Falling Down"" William ""D-FENS"" Foster (Michael Douglas) is a defence industry engineer who, after having been divorced and laid off from his job, is confronted by a series of situations which provoke him into outbursts of extreme violence. His increasingly irrational behaviour is the response of a man whose personal life has unravelled at the same time as he believes that changes in society have transformed L.A. into an urban hell.Foster is first seen caught in a traffic jam on a sweltering hot day. His frustration grows to a point where he can't tolerate it any more and so decides to abandon his car and walk on to his ex-wife's house because it's his daughter's birthday and he wants to attend her party.On his journey across the city, Foster first gets into an argument with a Korean shopkeeper about the high prices that he charges and then terrorises the man by brandishing a baseball bat and trashing a large number of the products that are on display in the shop.He then has a confrontation with a couple of Hispanic gang members who threaten him with a butterfly knife for having inadvertently wandered onto their territory. He retaliates using his baseball bat and pockets the knife after the two men run away. The two gang members later seek revenge when, with others, they try to kill Foster in a drive-by shooting that goes wrong. After some people are shot and the gang's car crashes, most of the gang are killed. Foster then goes over to a badly injured survivor and using one of the gang's own guns, sadistically shoots him in the leg. He then picks up a bag full of weapons that he finds in the gang's car and continues on his journey.A whole series of incidents follow which either frustrate or anger Foster and he responds by actions such as terrorising the staff and customers of a fast food restaurant and killing a homophobic Neo-Nazi store owner from whom he steals a bazooka which he later fires in the direction of a group of men working on a construction site.The L.A.P.D. receive information about the various incidents and assume them to be unrelated until a desk-bound officer, Sergeant Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall) recognises they probably all involve the same man. Prendergast and his partner Detective Sandra Torres (Rachel Ticotin) deduce that Foster is probably heading towards his ex-wife's home and so rush to the house in Venice, California where Beth (Barbara Hershey) lives with their daughter and the events that follow soon lead to a confrontation between the two men.""Falling Down"" is a disturbing story which raises some interesting issues about the degrading treatment that ordinary people can suffer when they're made unemployed and divorced and they also live in an environment in which no-one treats anyone else with any respect. It's also understandable how an ordinary person can become brutalised by such an experience and how they could even descend into the type of madness that Foster goes through.It's also clear, however, that he had a pre-existing propensity for violence which Beth recognised and led her to taking out a restraining order against him. Although he'd never actually beaten her, she'd become terrified of him because she knew it would only take the right trigger to provoke him into extreme violence.Foster's appearance is not typical of a man of the nineties and suggests that his values are anchored in an earlier period of time. It is also, of course, a symptom of the fact that he's slow to recognise change and reluctant to come to terms with it.Prendergast is a man, who for different reasons, also experienced difficulties with his wife, the loss of his daughter, the imminent loss of his job and a lack of respect from those around him. His more reasoned and philosophical response to the situation is also seen as providing him with a more successful way of navigating his way out of the predicament than the course of action taken by Foster.Solid performances by Duvall and Hershey contribute greatly to the success of this film and Michael Douglas is exceptional as he expresses his character's anger, sadness and confusion with incredible power and poignancy.",Falling Down
76,RNMorton,Revealing if unpleasant look at modern life,7,17 October 1999,"Michael Douglas under duress is always fun to watch.  But this movie - about a divorced, unemployed middle-age man who just cracks one fine day - has too many nasty, unpleasant moments.  Robert Duvall is competent but not outstanding as hen-pecked police detective, and Rachel Ticotin is fine as always as his younger partner.

77,Prashast_Singh,A more thoughtful 90's action film.,10,11 August 2020,"Falling Down is a class apart. A solid action thriller that keeps you glued as you watch the ""protagonist"" dole out punishments throughout the film. Before watching it, I thought it might be like any other vigilante film where a disgruntled hero takes the law into his own hands for the sake of justice, for which he'd ultimately be celebrated. Well, I got it only half right. The film is indeed about a disgruntled man who takes the law into his own hands, but in the process, the line between good and evil is completely blurred and I found myself questioning whether to root for the ""hero"" or not. But, there were also times when I could root for him. Trust me, he's no ordinary character. He's someone many can relate to.Michael Douglas completely dominates the film from the very first scene, with his outstanding performance. There are other good performers too, including Robert Duvall, but ultimately it's Douglas who completes the film. Imagine watching a film with a big cast and yet having the feel of watching a one-man film: Falling Down is a masterpiece, and it's one of the rare films I just wanted to go on and on. The film is a smart mix of intense action, captivating drama and gripping suspense.Even for today's times, the film holds up well and is quite fresh in terms of subject and execution. If you want to see a different kind of action film where the lines between good and evil are blurred for real, and where you can really not decide whether to completely root for the hero or not, check out this film ASAP.

79,baumer,An important look at the decay of society,9,9 June 1999,"Falling Down is the kind of film that has much more more happening than many of us want to know about. It is disguised simply as a film about an apparent nut who goes out and tries to right the wrongs that have been done to him and in his trek across Los Angeles he becomes an anti-hero. While that may be true to an extent, read more into it and you can see a film that tries to show us that there is something terribly wrong with how we live. I wasn't alive in the 50's, in fact, I was born in the 70's. So I can't honestly tell you if life was easier back then. But what I can tell you is that times were a bit more simple then. For the most part, you had one income in the household. You had T.V and radio as your entertainment and kids went outside to play. Now you must have both parents working so you can have that double income. Kids are obsessed with the internet and videogames and so on. What does all of this have to with the film? Everything!Falling Down is about the decay in one man's life and how it affects not only him but those around him. There is one very powerful scene in the film that can sum up everything.There is a key moment in Falling Down that is sad in it's reality, but true in it's opinion. Douglas is in a surplus store and the guy running it is a Nazi sympathizer. When Douglass doesn't share his opinions, they get into a confrontation. The guy snaps and tells Douglas to spread against the wall. He obliges and then the Nazi guy wants to handcuff him. He tells Douglas to give him his hand, he does. Then he tells Douglas to give him his other hand. Douglas is supporting himself on the wall in a 30 degree angle and if he gives the guy his other hand "" he'll fall down. "" Which is precisely what he tells the Nazi guy. This is a microcosm of the film and a microcosm of what may be wrong with not only society but people in general. There is a theory in wrestling that your arms and legs are like a table, if you take out any two of the legs or arms, your opponent falls down and is vulnerable. Same thing with a human being. Take away so many of his limbs ( job, wife, dignity, credit rating, kids, etc. ) and it may be only a matter of time before that person does snap. This movie shows us what happens to one individual that does snap. He wasn't all that bad to begin with, but as time went on and he was "" lied "" to, he can't handle it and finally one day, he has had enough. I think this film is more important than people realize and if you have only seen it once, see it again. You may see something that you didn't see before. Hats off to Schumacher and Douglas who had the guts to make this film.",Falling Down
80,mattymatt4ever,Compelling film with a not-so-sympathetic character I can sympathize with,9,6 January 2003,"Spoilers We all have those bad days.  Those days where your life turns to crap and you feel like punching everyone in the face.  That's why I can sympathize with Douglas' character.  He's having a bad day and he simply wants to get through it without people p**sing him off.  Of course, he's a short fuse, but what fun would this story be if the character were mild-mannered?Douglas' methods of dealing with his anger are quite unorthodox, but if you had the courage to do so and didn't have laws inhibiting you from doing so, you would destroy a man's store for overcharging you for a can of Coke (85 cents?  Come on!  I don't know a single store around me that charges over 75 cents for a CAN of soda!) or murder the gang members who tried to pester you for ""trespassing on their property.""  I was cheering when Douglas beat the living daylights out of those 2 thugs.  Some of the things he did are pretty ridiculous, but that's what makes him a flawed character.  When I watch a movie, I tend to sympathize more with characters who aren't straitlaced and likable in a conventional sense, because I feel more of a connection to them (i.e.:  Kevin Spacey in ""American Beauty"").  I believe we're all demented in some sort of way; Hollywood has a way of making their sympathetic characters way too sympathetic because they're afraid audiences will become intimidated.  Oh boo-hoo!  I'm sure I'm gonna read quite a few comments saying how difficult it is to like a film where the main character's not that likable.  Sure, pulling a gun on a fast food manager and cashier for not serving breakfast is pretty darn crazy--and what he does afterwards is even crazier--but we all do crazy things!  Maybe not as outlandish as that, but crazy nonetheless.But when it all boils down to it, his intentions are pure.  He just wants to go home to see his daughter and hand her a birthday present.  The store owner mistakes him for a theif and tells him, ""Take everything in the register!""  He doesn't want to steal from the owner; he feels the owner is stealing from him for charging 85 cents for a can of Coke.  When he lowers the price to 50 cents, he stuffs a dollar in the register, removes 50 cents in change which he needs to make a phone call and leaves.  As he says, ""I'm just defending my rights as a consumer.""  And when he hides in that rich family's backyard, suspecting that the cops are coming, the father tells him to take him along, thinking he's holding them hostage.  Douglas replies, ""I have a family of my own.""  His recurrent line is ""I'm just trying to go home.""  Through all his anger, you can see spurts of humanity in his character.  For example, when the Nazi gunshop owner throws the snowglobe, which Douglas hoped to give to his daughter, against the wall, he cries out ""No!""  He doesn't want to kill anybody, he doesn't want to steal from anybody, he just wants to go home to his daughter.Douglas' performance is great, one of the best of his career.  And it was also a wonderfully written part for him.  Robert Duvall also gives a fine performance as a straitlaced, mild-mannered but highly committed detective on his last day of work.  And boy is Rachel Ticotin--one of the very few female stars of ""Con Air""--one hot babe!  Joel Schumacher's direction is quite vivid and uses a color pallette that gives the audience a feel of the sweltering Los Angeles heat--much like Spike Lee displayed Bed-Stuy's hottest day of the year in ""Do the Right Thing.""  This movie took me on a wild ride that's both bursting with excitement and darkly hilarious. Yes, I laughed a lot during the film, mostly at Douglas' witty one-liners which delighted me even more, since I was able to sympathize with his character.My score:  9 (out of 10)",Falling Down
81,thekarmicnomad,Still stands on a 2021 re-watch,8,22 August 2021,"I have not watched this for about twenty years.It is a story of a man whose long term problems all come to a head on a single day and he rages against the world around him.Some of the acting and dialogue wasn't as good as I remember (even on first watch the beggar in the park was a bit rubbish) and some of the points weren't as subtle as they could be.But the action and especially the characters are a lot richer than I recall.Everyone in the film has their own issues and are dealing best they can, some better than others.This film has that old-school attention to character detail that is lacking in a lot of modern films.Even a secondary character like the girl involved in the shooting has depth - even if it is something as simple as her arguing with her mother about aiding the police.The film manages to pull off a rare trick and takes the viewer on a journey.I found myself rooting for the protagonist as he applies a simplistic and brutal logic to a world that seems set against him, then I found my opinion shift as darker details about him gradually seep into the story, then it is hard not to feel compassion for him as you realize the constant grind he is under.Then there are the other characters who are left to deal with the aftermath of his rampage.A great movie with some uncomfortable scenes that makes you think, but is really fun at the same time.Douglas and Duvall give out standing performances.They are superbly supported by Hershey, Ticotin and Weld all who really add something to their characters - especially Hershey who perfectly sells Beth: who can see the potential of an impending disaster but doesn't want to cause a fuss.To get the most from this you need to pay attention, as not everything is spelled out - things like the photos on the dresser, the purple heart above the fireplace or the look on Douglas's face as he watches an old movie of him screaming at his wife - these are not directly referenced but really paint a vivid picture.Still a great movie.",Falling Down

When i tried to explain that they were not popular because every time someone tries to order one they have to wait an eternity for you to cook it, i was presented with a face of immense puzzlement and confusion! I'm not saying i would ever go as far as Michael Douglas does when he cant get his breakfast 2 minutes after the cut off time in this film but i understand EXACTLY how he feels.!. Falling Down is a very good interpretation on how if someone not quite the full package, comes up against the day to day greedyness ,rudeness and descrimination of todays western society and how he feels he needs to get his point across in his own way.

84,TOMASBBloodhound,"Hit and miss, but generally engrossing.",7,11 December 2011,"Sometimes we all feel outnumbered, confused, or ""not economically viable"". But thankfully most of us don't strike back violently like Michael Douglas in Falling Down. Douglas plays an unemployed defense contractor who finds himself out of a job in the early 1990s now that the Cold War is over. He is also estranged from his family, and thought to be a danger to them. One morning, while stuck in a traffic jam, he cannot take any more. He gets out of his car and starts walking across L.A., claiming he is simply ""going home"". Basically this means to his daughter's birthday party where even if he made it there, he would not be welcome anyway. He reacts violently to anyone who confronts or hassles him on the way home. And on the streets of L.A., there is trouble around every corner. Douglas leaves plenty of victims in his wake. Depending on your own life's experiences, you may or may not agree with his actions.It is easy to compare this movie to Death Wish, or some other vigilante film, but this is far more complex for better or sometimes worse. The big problem with the film is its meandering perspective. The scenes where Douglas confronts stereotypical big city types are often constructed in a manner that we the audience are supposed to see it his way. We are supposed to recognize their behavior or attitudes that set him off, and more or less accept his reaction. All the while we are meant to believe he is crazy. So, in effect, if we've ever thought about taking out our frustrations on rude or dangerous people, then we may in fact be crazy too. Douglas is clearly a loon, but so are these stereotypical store clerks, construction workers, gang members, old buzzards on a golf course, homeless urchins, etc. How can we not take some satisfaction as Douglas stabs a Neo-Nazi? Or blows up a needless construction site that is wasting tax payer money? Does that make us crazy, too? Or does it only if we actually commit the violence? The film has some annoying female characters playing Douglas's estranged wife and Robert Duvall's overbearing wife. In fact, just about every character is this film is somewhat annoying. Maybe this is done to add to the frustration Douglas feels. Duvall plays an aging cop working his last day before retirement. His aggravating wife keeps demanding he comes home before he gets hurt on his last day. That whole angle is a bit stereotypical. Did it have to be his LAST day? How about a couple months before retirement? Joel Schumacher has done much worse, but Falling Down is not great. How you respond to it will depend on your own perspectives. Can you believe this is almost 20 years old? Is L.A. better or worse since then? How has your town or city changed? Are you economically viable? A greater number of Americans likely find themselves not so viable in these days of Hope and Change. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Falling Down

He gets out of the car and starts walking, but soon faces several people who try to hinder him - jerks, criminals, fanatics. Foster snaps and begins his descent into madness and violence. Cop Prendergast (Robert Duvall), on his last day before retirement, pursues him.Schumacher made some terrible films in his careers (I am looking at you, Batman & Robin), but this one redeems him to an extent. It's surprising on how many levels Falling Down works: black comedy, social commentary, drama, character study... besides, this has to be one of the most crowd-pleasing movies of all times. Fact is, in most over-stressed inhabitants of great cities there is something of William Foster. And even if ""D-Fens"" is nuts, at first he is even somewhat sympathetic.Douglas delivers here the best performance of his career. As Foster he is creepy, funny and pathetic all at the same time. Duvall gives a nicely understated turn as quietly competent Prendergast.Supporting players are wonderful too, and perfectly cast. From smug Rick to the annoying panhandler, from the unfriendly shopkeeper to the bitter construction worker, they really look and act like people you could meet in those situations in real life.And Falling Down is, among all other things, very funny. The script has an hilariously wicked quality to it.

86,The_Movie_Cat,"""I'm the bad guy? How'd that happen?""",5,10 January 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
A W.A.S.P. gets the ultimate road rage in Taxi Driver for the hard of thinking. Is it any wonder that Falling Down's director went on to make Batman and Robin? What has the potential to be an insightful film is strangled by patronising unsubtlety and jarring comic setpieces.Michael Douglas (is that ever a good idea?) plays the lead, a sacked white collar worker who's on a rampage because he's charged 85 cents for a Coke and can't order breakfast in a pseudo-McDonalds three minutes past the deadline. Robert Duvall, in probably the least of his performances, plays a policeman so unliked even his close personal colleagues call him Prendergast. His disenchanted, slightly racist attitudes are used as a counterpoint to Douglas'. Or at least they would be if the characters were more than two-dimensional sketches.The narrative moves along in fits and starts, with an awkward structure. It's text takes in diatribes against minorities and the American dream, giving it a responsibility to portray those issues effectively. However, what should have been an intense, dark thriller is given way to forced ironic juxtaposition. Take the scene in the restaurant. Douglas, ranting against having to call the service staff by their first names, as dictated by their badges, produces a gun. ""Well,"" says an assistant, ""you can call me Miss Folsam if you want to."" Some people probably find that kind of thing very amusing, but with that one sentence you've instantly lost any credibility the scene had; worse than that, you've broken the fourth wall. For no-one facing a gunman would say such a thing, the whole scene is played for laughs, and so you're instantly taken out of the reality of the picture and reminded that what you're watching is just a film.Other irritating moments abound, like the moment where Douglas cannot operate a bazooka. So a small boy comes along and nonchalantly tells him how to do so, with a shrug of the shoulders and a ""I saw it on TV."" Okay, Shoe Maker is making a point that children are exposed to violence (Though as this film has more than it's fair share, he's lobbing rocks from a greenhouse), but does he have to do it so heavy-handedly? Every single plot point is rammed home, from the Korean guy who knocks over a tray full of mini American flags, to the ""financially unviable"" protestor to the road workers. Worst of all, the concept that the lead may have right-wing tendencies is never dealt with adequately, merely used as a plot device to move Douglas from disaster to disaster, it's implications unresolved.And can someone tell me how, when he's watching that video of his wife and kid and pauses it, then legs it out of the house, how come for the end of the film it's begun to play again, ten minutes earlier on in the tape? Does that video have a special ""rewind ten minutes then play"" switch??? Only in the final confrontation between Duvall and Douglas do we achieve anything approaching a form of emotional resonance. But it's too little too late, a last dying gasp from a lazy irresponsible film.",Falling Down
87,agmoldham,I'm going home,7,23 December 2003,"This probably will not everybody's cup of tea, but if you're having a bad day it will be difficult not to relate to D Fens (Douglas). It's probably not an accident that there's quite a few similarities in the lives of D Fens and retiring police officer Prendergast (Duvall). As with most good films it also makes you think a bit. At what point does D Fens cross the line ? I'd suggest the Whammy Burger joint, but he does have a point with his flat burger and 2 minutes late for breakfast. The point of no return is a truly sinister scene.",Falling Down
88,Vivekmaru45,If you don't like it then CHANGE IT BY FORCE if necessary.,10,21 April 2010,"The message of this film is very clear. The film discusses itself on various topics political, social, economic, religion and morality.It also show what damage a single person can do to an established order of government.Joel Schumacher's greatest achievement for screen, and a film that should rightly have a sequel be made. A beautiful script by Ebbe Roe Smith.Michael Douglas plays William Foster an unemployed defense worker frustrated with the various flaws he sees in society, begins to psychotically and violently lash out against them with expected results. One man can only so much battle against a horde of enemies, and while his cause is just he is eventually fighting a downhill battle (hence the title of the film) and we see the inevitable end approaching. We all see a different side to Foster as a man who deeply loves his family and this is very moving.Seeing this film it definitely seems to me that the world has definitely gone to the dogs (and becoming worse every day)and the righteous cannot survive here.Overall a film that tells you never to give up fighting and to hold righteousness and high ideals no matter what the adversary.",Falling Down
89,itamarscomix,A forgotten gem from the 90's,8,17 July 2012,"Falling Down is one of the strongest action films from the 1990's, and a sharp reminder that Joel Schumacher was once capable of subtlety and smart stylistic choices, rather than just throwing out every visual tool at his disposal at the camera.The story of one ordinary man who had enough of society and goes on a violent rampage reminded many people of Taxi Driver, a comparison which doesn't do Falling Down justice. At the heart of Falling Down is a fast-paced action movie, and the psychological depth and social condemnation of Taxi Driver is nowhere to be found. However, the film does do a terrific job of throwing the viewer into the protagonist's neurotic, claustrophobic state of mind with minimalistic but effective editing and camera work.Veterans Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall put a lot of heart into characters who, on paper, are little more than clichés. In the end, what makes Falling Down work so well is that in spite of a script quite rich in clichés and one-liners, it feels like an intimate independent film as much as a Hollywood action blockbuster.",Falling Down
90,Atreyu_II,Michael Douglas in one of his best roles and performances,7,6 August 2010,"'Falling Down' is an unusual and original thriller of urban nightmare which is both comical and sickly.This film might be from 1993 but it's just so modern. Actually, it is more significant now than when it was made and, I dare to say, ever - which disguises its age. True, even in the good old days there were problems, but the world was better at the time. The world has changed a lot and everything that surrounds it, even more so since we entered in the 2000 generation. And progress just keeps changing the world and everything fast, way too fast. The world has gone crazy.Michael Douglas is the main protagonist. While he does a great portrayal of the character William Foster, better than his performance is the character himself. It's an unusual role by Michael Douglas and that's what makes the movie interesting. The role he portrays is the reflex of this generation. People are always in rush, under pressure and stress nowadays. Exactly like Douglas's character. The big difference is that Douglas's character found a way to throw up all his fury by doing things that most of us wouldn't have the guts to, no matter how much urge we felt to. You've gotta admire this guy for that.William Foster does very wrong things, but I understand just how he feels and what he is going through. The demands and fierceness of society, the pressures, the frustrations, the stress, the nerves... all of that can lead to insanity. Don't we all just want to explode at times, just like Douglas's character? I'm sure that we all feel like this in certain times of our lives.Deep down, Foster ain't a bad guy. He is just an ordinary guy who has become so stressed and frustrated that he has come to a point which he can't hide his anger anymore. That is obvious on his variable temper. He is enraged, disturbed, confused and makes sardonic observations on life and other stuff.Basically the story is about him, a normal man declaring war against his daily frustrations across the city of Los Angeles and at the same time trying to get home for his daughter's birthday party. And it all happens in only one day! A very hot Summer day, to be precise.Not everything is good, though. I hate the Nazi guy and the whole sequence with him. As for the ending, although well made, it's a shame that Foster gets killed. I feel sorry for the guy.The best parts of the film are: the crazy korean convenience store sequence; the hilarious sequence at the fast food restaurant; the bazooka sequence - that's hysterical! (he doesn't even know how to use it, but a kid teaches him); the golf course bit.",Falling Down
91,LeRoyMarko,I liked it,8,10 April 2001,"I've seen this movie a few times now and I still really enjoy it. Yes, of course, there some racist remarks in this movie but I still think that a lot of people feel like the guy played by Michael Douglas. I don't say that I'm thinking that way or that people should think like that, but let's face the music, it's a fact that some people tend to see all minorities like that guy. And that's too bad. Where it's different for the majority, it's the degree used to express their frustration.Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall are both great in this movie.Out of 100, I gave it 82.",Falling Down
92,tonypeacock-1,Just give me a breakfast. I know the feeling sometimes.,8,5 November 2019,"Perhaps the greatest performance by main star Michael Douglas as a made redundant defence worker who has a mental breakdown.Douglas plays De Fens who one day cracks under the stress of an LA traffic jam.A succession of situations envelops with ever more elaborate scenes of violence and death.
De Fens begins the film as a bloke in his late thirties, wearing a shirt and tie. Hardly your everyday murderer.In scenes that resemble the Death Wish films Douglas takes out his frustration at his failed marriage and financial situation at seemingly random people. All he wants to do is get home!The LA traffic gridlock reminded me of my home city. I could empathise with some of De Fens frustrations especially when trying to get home via publuc transport after a days work. However some of his actions are extreme to say the least.I have not visited this film for many years. It is one of those films that appears under the radar as such. It was a part of my old VHS collection it's that old!Directed by Joel Schumacher who is probably better known for a couple of non spectacular Batman films in the 1990s.The film also stars Robert Duvall as an LA cop with an interesting last day before his retirement and an even more interesting wife!",Falling Down
93,ofpsmith,A man who confronts all the problems he sees with society on his way home.,9,3 January 2015,"William Foster (Michael Douglas) is having a bad day. He was just laid off from his job, he is divorced from his wife Beth Trevino (Barbara Hershey) who has a restraining against him, and he's stuck in traffic. Foster is just trying to get to his daughter's birthday party. But he get's out of his car and leaves it in the road. When asked where he's going he replies ""I'm going home."" And that's the point where Falling Down starts. Foster is just the average American who is confronted with all kinds of problems. Eventually he can't take it any more so he completely snaps. He storms across Los Angeles violently lashing out against all the injustices that get in his way. Meanwhile we see Sergeant Martin Prendergast (Robert Duvall) a police officer on his last day of work dealing with similar injustices at the police station as he attempts to track Foster down. As you watch this movie you realize that even though Foster is a complete nut, you can sympathize with lots of the problems he encounters. I mean who hasn't gotten a burger that looks nothing at all like the one of the menu. Prendergast is also annoyed at his surrounding but he seems to have kept himself together. Douglas and Duvall play Foster and Prendergast perfectly, and the writing is equally enjoyable. It's a perfect depiction of the many problems with society of the modern age. I highly recommend it.",Falling Down
94,emm,Over-the-edge action drama has a slightly harsh temper.,6,25 April 1999,"FALLING DOWN is a simple little rarity because the ""defense worker turned anti-hero"" makes the plays on the offense and scores. It's exactly what drives Michael Douglas to the boiling point of an unsettling society going the wrong way and uses force to correct everything. Talk about a no-good, very bad day! I wished he wasn't so cold in his tough-as-nails acting performance as he appears like he's got a shortage of angry feelings, but he still has what it takes. Joel Schumacher gives this entertaining movie a hard-heavy description of American life and society that is ""falling down"" through these progressive days. In the end, violence isn't always the true answer to a plot that should take it easy once in a while. This also leaves you with reasons unclear as to why Douglas is purposely going out on a killing rampage. It's obviously made to show off an expression of anger through violence in the movie, but why? Seriously, this is one of those occasions that has you favoring for the bad guy to win (like most us would agree here), but I still don't get the picture. The performance by Robert Duvall as a nearly-retired cop was very good, though.",Falling Down
95,Bogmeister,No Defense When He's Mad as Hell,8,30 April 2006,"Ever have one of those days? It's too hot and you're stuck in a traffic jam. Everyone around you acts like it's not a problem...what is with all these people? And then there's this fly buzzing around... sure, you know what that's all about, eh? But you don't snap, do you? You don't just leave your car in the middle of the road. And you don't make your way on foot through the city, lashing out at anyone you run across to ease your own pain, your growing frustration. You might, though, if you're a white-collar worker like the one played by Douglas. He's reached a midway point in some ugly midlife crisis as this story begins and by the half-hour mark, he's gone beyond the point of no return. Who can identify with him? - try about 20 million middle class American males. Douglas creates an interesting and compelling character here. He's not completely crazy nor is he entirely oblivious to his surroundings in his obsessed determination to reach 'home.' What he is, though, is very angry, just boiling mad - probably because he held it all in for his entire adult life up to this point. So when he runs across the various inane qualities that make up big city modern life - rude shopkeepers, local gang members, vapid fast food rules - well, this takes its cue from the film ""Network"" - he's mad as hell and not gonna take it anymore. It's a bit on the simplistic side but we soon realize it's not meant to be a fully realistic slice of life. We've all probably felt that twinge of embarrassment over all those huge golf courses taking up all that space - this is wish fulfillment fantasy on what we might do in a daydream. By the time he uses that rocket launcher as a protest against the misuse of a construction contract budget, we realize its more of a parable, a satire and commentary on our society. The interest is in going on this journey with Douglas and see what he next encounters. I think it stretched things past a limit during his confrontation with the neo-Nazi skinhead bigot-nutcase, but even that scene served to underscore the differences between the two: Douglas did come across as racist during his earlier scene with the Korean shopkeeper, but he was more irritated by the man's inability to enunciate English words than anything else; let's face it, Douglas is just fuming about everyone here - there's not much discrimination. Just check out his nasty parting remarks to the rich old white fat-cat on the golf course.In a parallel storyline, we see another fine actor, Duvall, as a cop on the verge of retiring - this is literally his last day on the job. His scenes with the other cops and, over the phone, with his tiring wife, lack the intensity of Douglas being on the move and, after a couple of minutes of such easygoing charm, we want to get back to Douglas on the prowl. But it all comes together in the end; Douglas & Duvall seemed to be heading for similar fates (it's hinted more than once that Duvall may end up being shot) but in the climax their respective destinies were always to be completely at odds with each other - we just don't realize this until it ends.",Falling Down

97,0w0,"Fed up, not gonna take it anymore",7,25 July 2014,"This movie perfectly demonstrates exactly how most of humanity would behave if there were zero repercussions for what we do or say: If someone insulted you, you club them over the head; if someone blocks your road, you blow up the road. This movie shows a very pathetic and inadequate police-force being given the-run-around all through the movie, even until the very end. The movie not only follows 'D-FENS's story, but also that of the retiring policeman who's chasing him. 'D-FENS' is on a very mellow rampage against all things that irritate us daily, but he definitely isn't your average working man: He is a racist, short tempered dad 'who just wants to go home', but he wreaks havoc all along the way.

When you have a bad day, get home, see it and download, but Joel Schumacher has no courage to finish it well. In spoiler zone I will explain.Today that violence is so well seen, this film is based on it, but rather I think it is an irony, not what happens, but it is made for us to download. Everything that happens in the film would normally end with a bitch Michael Douglas that would go to something else and now. But here he has made it so that we all laugh. Or at least I take it that way.It is still a minor movie with an extraordinary cast. It's not a TV movie but it's very close.The picture is not fantastic. It is rather simple. It does not count.The address is pretty basic. Do not bore and laugh with her. But in matters of planes is simple.The actors are great. I imagine the filming, the laughter that would take off.Spoiler:The problem is that in the end he has to make a politically correct film and ends with that he has a disease so he has done everything he has done. So for me it has not made a great movie. If I had not done so, perhaps we would not have understood, or perhaps today would have been acclaimed, since violence is very well considered",Falling Down
99,LebowskiT1000,"A truly depressing film, with a lot of great stuff.",8,15 December 2002,"I'm not really even sure why I like this film so much, in fact I'm not so sure that I did the first time I viewed it.  Since then I've seen it a few times and can now truly appreciate this film.  The story is fairly simple, but done so well that you just can't wait to see what happens next.Michael Douglas pulls off one of his best performances to date as William Foster, a man that has finally had it with the pressures and annoyances of life and just looses all control.  Robert Duvall pulls off another great performance, as Officer Prendergast, although very similar to various other roles that he has done.  Barbara Hershey is fantastic in the film as the former wife of William Foster.  She really shows in her character how truly scared she is for her daughter and what William will do.  Rachel Ticotin is another bonus in the film as Prendergast's partner/friend.  She does a very good job with her role.Joel Schumacher pulls off another great directorial effort.  He seems to be a truly exceptional director from the films of his that I've seen thus far (with exception of the ""Batman & Robin"" debacle of course).  He seems to very good with intense films such as this film, ""8mm"", ""A Time to Kill"", ""The Client"", ""Flatliners"" and so on.  Keep up the good work Joel.This film is full of scenes that I really, truly love.  I love how most of the situations in the film could be completely avoided if people would just be a little nicer to each other or understanding, but instead, they have to be jerks about it and make things difficult, and thus escalating the tension in the situation.  I really liked that when push came to shove with William, he didn't show any mercy and taught whoever that person may be a lesson (more so in the beginning of the film, the scenes get more and more intense as the film progresses, by the end of the film he has far surpassed simple lessons).  William is quite an interesting character, because he does have a temper and is a truly disturbed individual, but he is actually quite kind and caring in his heart.  By the end of the film, you can't help but feel for him, but still keeping in mind that he's got some major issues.I definitely wouldn't recommend this film to just anyone.  I would only recommend this film to people that really like intense dramatic films that are rather depressing.  Although, if you just want to see some great acting, then this is a great choice.  If you do end up seeing the film, I genuinely hope that you enjoy it as much as I did.  Even if you don't like it so much the first time, give a second chance.  I guess after writing this review, I now realize why I like this film so much.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Falling Down
100,Horror-yo,"Strong, worth the time",8,30 July 2018,"This one has many things going for itself. First, let's start with the beginning of the film: implied cinematography, exasperation reaching its pinnacle of the main character himself immediately introduced to the audience rather than a whole introductory sequence making cinematic small talk with its public to establish how things go from daily routine to disaster. We get to know the character as the movie develops, and other secondary characters intentionally or unintentionally uncover who he is; no need for the film to stop and spell out who lead character Michael Douglas is and why he's the way he is, the film instead grows into the explanation in and of itself with each poignant scene building a crescendo overtime and unravelling its plot.Another thing is Michael Douglas is one of the most underrated lead actors of the 90's as he's often considered for everything else but his acting (son of Hollywood superstar Kirk Douglas, being a producer, etc...), and is excellent yet again here. He's totally committed to the role, plays it like his character was real down to the smaller details: for example, he easily could've played his character displaying too much confidence but he manages to convey that he's middle-class and a goodie two shoes gone rogue, the ambiguity and fracture of his character transpires which makes for a pleasant and enticing, nuanced viewing.Another thing is it's very well paced. As explained in the first paragraph, the opening scene blitzes right past the viewer and constitutes one of the smoother intros for its genre/for its time, but as the film advances it never seems to go off track or lose momentum, it just keeps building in intensity and keeps focus on what it's trying to say and what it means to be as a viewing experience. Totally coherent. If you don't like it 30min in, you probably won't like it at all; conversely, if you like it 30min, you'll like it til the last bit.Lastly, the film manages to do really well at surely the most important thing in cinema: be as much entertainment as it is making a commentary on a particular social/political/philosophical issue. It isn't another neutral, mindless 90's action flick starring what's his face: it takes a stand and points out the terrible dysfunction of modern America, but balances that with the entertainment value. You don't want to have to sit through some politically biased tripe for 2 hours either, you want to watch a good movie.",Falling Down
101,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: deep, but not thematically",6,31 March 2002,"Falling Down is difficult to rate because it is basically two movies.The movie I liked was a series of little sketches about how life is often unfair and people often self-deluding about their own charity towards others.The other movie is about an anti-hero who freaks out all day. Without spoiling the story for you, let's just say it is not possible to empathize with the protagonist, even though the movie seems to want us to. This prevents the story from being fully engaging, even though there is a real plot.Michael Douglas is great as usual. I'm an action loving guy, and normally I don't like dramas. Falling Down is a drama with adequate action and accessible to a non-arty guy like me. Solid, could have been better. Deep in little minuets, but stitched together into a whole film, I didn't find it thematically whole.Who should see this film:-- Michael Douglas fans (you know you want to)-- Action movie buffs who have nothing better to do on a rainy dayand like social commentary-- Drama buffs who have nothing better to do on a rainy dayand don't mind getting their social commentary from a guyfreaking out (similar to but not as violent as ""First Blood"",the first Rambo movie, which everyone thinks is a dumb actionflick until they see it -- it's about society shunning veterans)I'll give ""Falling Down"" a 6 out of 10.",Falling Down
102,dfa120374,This Movie Definitely Doesn't Fall Down,6,16 January 2015,"Michael Douglas plays William Foster, a seemingly average guy just trying to get home for his daughter's birthday. The thing is, Foster has, shall we say, become a little unbalanced due to certain problems and is prone to violent outbursts, so when Foster decides to just leave his car in the middle of a traffic jam, he starts off on a journey taking him through various incidents from dealing with gang members to just trying to get breakfast. Robert Duvall plays L.A. Detective Prendergast, a cop who is just trying to get through his last day before retirement but unwittingly gets caught up in trying to find Foster.I had first seen Falling Down when it came out in 1993. I thought it was a good movie then and after seeing it again 21 years later, I still think it's a good movie. Falling Down is most definitely not a vigilante movie, and I can't see how anyone can even think it is. If anyone thinks it is then they really need to look up the definition of what a vigilante actually is.The story is one that we can all relate to as well in some form or another as I'm sure we've all had that fast food dinner that looks nothing like it's picture, encountered ignorant workmen, or had obnoxious people complaining about the littlest of things. The difference is, most of us wouldn't act out in the way that Foster does, but I think that's where it poses the question...how would YOU handle these situations if you were in Fosters shoes? The film does get a wee bit slow & repetitive in places as well with Foster wandering from incident to incident, but in a way it's these incidents - and how a seemingly average guy handles them - is what keeps it going. That and, of course, Douglas' great performance.While obviously not being a comedy, Falling Down does have some really good touches of darker comedic moments in the attempt to break some of the seriousness of what is happening in the film.All in all, Falling Down is a really decent movie to watch, so if you've not seen it yet then it's one I recommend giving a go.",Falling Down
103,elicopperman,"When Society Crumbles, One Average Joe Stumbles",9,5 June 2019,"One question I've always asked myself is whether or not an audience can sympathize with a psychopathic maniac for a protagonist. Well, sometimes that type of character can actually surface well in a form of fiction, be it a book or movie, such as the case with this particular film, Falling Down. Despite it underperforming financially upon release, it did gain positive reviews and has garnished a cult following, and for good reason. What makes it such a fascinating experience is that its main character finds fault all around society yet is still wrong.The story centers on a divorced former contact worker, William Foster, who decides to walk through Los Angeles to get to his estranged ex-wife in time for his daughter's birthday party. Along the way, he encounters many provocative oddities that make him react with violence and sardonic views on life, poverty, the economy, and even commercialism. Meanwhile, aging police officer Martin Prendergast has to track down the crazed Foster on the day of his retirement. Part of the intrigue in Foster's arch is how much he criticizes the truth about the flaws with our world and is able to point out every bad person he sees, from thugs, to low lives and even white supremacists. However, given how low he sinks into his own rage, he becomes completely oblivious to the dilemmas that plague him, such as his lack of self awareness and delusions of grandeur.Despite the film's social commentary telling us that the pressures of modern capitalism can affect any given social class, it does have a good balance between drama and entertainment. Of course, many of the misadventures Foster faces are played up for laughs, including one at a fast food joint, but they still represent how some people with clear mental problems can be affected by such overwhelming tactics. Even at that though, we do see a surprising amount of closure with Foster and how he reflects upon the loving father he used to be in spite of his anger problem. As for Prendergast, he himself was inflicted with several unfortunate circumstances in his life, which in turn creates a bitter side to him that can only make one wish he gets a better life. Although he calls Foster's disdain towards society a pathetic excuse for his rampage, it still gives him one last hurrah before retirement.In addition to fascinating characters, the acting is really high class given the talent they got on board. Michael Douglas does a great job of contrasting both the relaxed and furious sides of Foster with numerous emotions sprinkled throughout, from visceral anger to repressed sadness. Robert Duvall is very charismatic as Prendergast and is able to present the right amount of inner discomfort to make one feel for him based on what happened to the poor guy. Barbara Hershey creates a good amount of reasonable paranoia in Beth Trevino, Foster's ex-wife, especially since you never know what Foster could do to her or their child. Even the supporting cast and extras range from relatable to charming characters having witnessed the lunacy of Foster's fury, from Rachel Ticotin, to Tuesday Wild, to Frederic Forest and Michael Paul Chan. A great cast can always elevate material that's already overwhelming in nature.With a premise and execution wild as this, I think it's safe to say that even psychopaths can have a point on how society can cave in on the human race. Overall, Falling Down is not only a unique thriller film with fascinating characters, intriguing social satire and impressive acting, but it is also a reminder to us all that we should not take everything in our lives for granted. Just like it did to a man who had enough of the rubbish infesting our lives, society can either make or break people if not left unchecked. In a day and age where it seems as if the latter is happening way more often, we need works of fiction like this to influence us to not get rapped up in so much hysteria and improve on ourselves as a population. Keep remembering that the next time you want to live a mundane life surrounded by the horrors of reality.",Falling Down

If things couldn't get any worse, he hears about D-FNSE going on a rampage from shooting a liquor store, killing a bunch of gang members, holding a burger joint hostage, killing a racist military expert, blowing up a construction site, killing a rich golf member and the only response from most witnesses is that he's a white guy with a shirt and tie.There are many movies that I recall where it had these male losers who didn't do anything at all. ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" was the early movie of where teens went through different topics, except for Jeff Spicoil who didn't care about anything except for surfing; ""The Big Lebowski"" was a story about a man who didn't give a crap about anything except smoking grass; ""American Splendor"" showed the life of Harvey Pekar who wouldn't care if 9/11 happened, and was tired of living with the rules of trying to be like everybody else. ""Falling Down"" is different. It's a man who is tired of the system and of waiting for somebody to do something about it; D-FENS is just the type of guy we need.",Falling Down

109,DavidSim240183,One man out to tear down a crippled society one flaw at a time,10,17 August 2007,"I think Joel Schumacher is a really terrible filmmaker. Nearly every one of his films is an exercise in flashy stylistics with not a single thing to say. Look no further than his Batman films. But on one occasion, he managed to rise above his desire for eye-candy overkill. And produce something really worthwhile. And Falling Down was that film.Falling Down would have to be the best film out of Schumacher's mostly awful body of work. Its the one thing he's ever done where he actually forgets about battering an audience into submission with glorious light effects and pretty costumes and sets. He's produced a violent story to be sure. But a curiously humane one too. And Michael Douglas is its human centre.Douglas plays Bill Foster, a defence worker of seven years who gets laid off. He spends the next month and a half trying to make sense of the tattered shreds of his life. He's a man with no job. No wife and daughter because they've cut him out of their lives. And most importantly, he's a man without purpose.But on one particularly hot day in LA, he finds a purpose. The opening scene is filled with glaringly aggressive closeups of Douglas' face. Sweating and twitching. All while he's sitting in his car in the middle of an agonisingly slow traffic jam. You know something is coming. Something is about to erupt. And that thing is Bill. In a split-second he snaps, abandons his car and tells the baffled motorist behind him he's going home.Although Bill is indeed going home to his wife and daughter, he makes a few stops along the way. Bill has become so disillusioned by society's flaws and shortcomings, he feels a need to rectify it by lashing out at the mundane trappings of our everyday lives. With his crew-cut, white shirt and tie, briefcase in one hand and automatic weapon in the other, its Ordinary Joe meets GI Joe.Its hard to believe Falling Down came from the same director of mindless trash like Batman & Robin. This is an acutely observed portrait of the sorry state of our affairs. And Michael Douglas turns in a real showstopper of an acting performance. Its a style of acting brimming with raw honesty. He plays a man not at the mercy of madness, but someone who's grown accustomed to it. This is the film Michael Douglas should have won an Oscar for.The film is bold enough to portray Bill as an object of sympathy, even when he's committing shocking acts of violence. Bill is a middle aged man, who felt he was in control all of his life, and when everything that mattered to him fell to dust, it left him a broken man. His new mission gives him something to focus on, but I sense its not quite the liberating experience Bill envisioned it would be. Even when he tries to reassert control, his inherent emptiness still plagues him. What a brave, plaintively truthful performance!Falling Down has received a fair amount of criticism, especially from racial minorities, who have lambasted the film because Bill's targets appear to be Korean shopkeepers or Latino street gangs. It is easy to view it in that context. That Bill is nothing more than a walking megaphone venting his hatred towards foreigners. But that's too narrow a vision. Schumacher's direction is really more expansive then you realise.Yes he does trash the Korean's store, because he overcharges for a can of Coke, and Bill won't have enough change left over for the payphone. And yes he beats up Latino thugs. But these are just the bystanders along the way of Bill's inexorable journey. I don't think there's any intentional malice intended there.And Schumacher's direction is quite excellent. He stages self-contained vignettes that are tiny microcosms of what exactly is wrong with this world. Like the scene at the fast-food restaurant. A classic example of the bureaucratic red tape that deliberately sets out to entangle people like poor Bill. Who hasn't felt like standing up for they're rights as a consumer? Bill can't have breakfast because he's a few minutes late. These are the type of absurdities Bill is campaigning against.Falling Down works like a steadily unfolding carpet. And as Bill walks through the city of LA, he is wearing out the hollow material that its weaved from. There is a very natural flow to the film. Things fall into place quite beautifully. Such as when Bill makes the decision to carry a bag full of weapons instead of his normal briefcase. This is a man going through a steady metamorphosis from which there is no return.Some people have felt disappointed by the somewhat low-key ending. But I felt it couldn't have ended any other way. Its an ending of weary resignation. No matter how much Bill has tried to add meaning to his rootless existence, the truth is society may have to live with its flaws. No matter what Bill's efforts.One of the most daring films of the 90s, and any film that attempts to address society's failings with such frank honesty deserves strong commendation indeed.",Falling Down
110,SkullScreamerReturns,Everybody's having a bad day once in a while,8,18 May 2020,"Falling Down is a movie that I liked when I first saw it but it gets even better with age. It's a good action thriller, a thought provoking drama and societal commentary, and also quite funny. It's not a actually a comedy in the first place but it's often quite hilarious.First of all, Michael Douglas is great in the lead role. Even though his character is quite nuts he's easily relatable because everybody has sometimes those days when every minor thing gets to your nerves. That's one thing that makes this movie so satisfying. You just want him to get even with all the seemingly unfair situations that cross his way.Secondly, I really really like the way how the plot is construced. It seems almost like a video game. He goes from place to another, gets into new conflicts, and collects heavier weapons along the way. What first is just an ordinary man trying to get home becomes an offbeat Rambo being at war with the world.The police characters are also performed with good actors and the scenes with the detectives trying to figure out who is the crazy guy causing trouble across the city, it all plays really well with the main plot. There are also memorable side characters like the loony army shop guy.The movie goes onwards like a train, with no boring moments. I've seen it multiple times and like to watch again every now and then. And every time I watch it makes me think of its themes from some different perspective. A very entertaining action movie that also has depth. Recommended.",Falling Down
111,Idocamstuf,An excellent and highly unusual film,10,9 April 2003,"This was the first Michael Douglas movie I saw and I have loved it ever since. This movie truly shows how life is unfair and sometimes you just feel like going over the edge. Michael Douglas should play characters like this much more often, because he's so much better at it then that victim he plays in all of his other movies. This should be the movie that Michael Douglas is known for. He plays a guy in which you don't know whether you should love or hate. Many scenes are actually quite funny too, providing some comic relief. One of the main reasons why I like this film so much is that Michael Douglas actually plays a character that everyman can relate to. In most of his other movies he always seems to play cocky rich guy, most notably Wall Street, where he plays the kind of guy you just want to see killed. But this is a much different role for Douglas. Anyone can relate to and empathize with Douglas' character in this film.Overall, this is a terrific film that shows how people can be pushed over the edge. I would recommend it to anybody. 10/10.",Falling Down
112,Cinemaniac1984,Very underrated movie.,10,4 January 2015,"There are a lot of controversial themes in Falling Down. Apart from the lead character's decent into madness, there is racism, homophobia, the decay of modern society, and cynical observations on life, poverty, commercialism and the economy.Many audiences know Michael Douglas for his roles in Wall Street (for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor), Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, and Traffic. Without a doubt, this is certainly one of his best roles to date. Michael Douglas plays William Foster, also known as D-FENS. The movie opens with William Foster stuck in the middle of a traffic jam. After his frustration boils over when the air conditioning fails to work in his car, he abandons his car in the middle of traffic. Foster's only reply, ""I'm going home"". From there he starts his journey across Los Angeles to see his estranged daughter for her birthday. We later learn that Foster is divorced from his wife (Barbara Hershey) and she has filed a restraining order again him. He has also recently lost his job.Along the many encounters on his way home, he clashes with a belligerent store owner, gang members who accost him, construction workers, homeless people, fast food workers, various rude people who behave with a sense of self-entitlement, and a bigoted Neo-Nazi. Foster just explodes after his buttons are pushed one too many times and lashes out at everyone, leaving behind him a path of destruction. Foster also accumulates along the way an arsenal of weapons which he uses to deal with the many problems he comes across. We also learn that he has had problems with his temper and unstable behaviour in the past, hence why his wife does not want anything to do with him.Robert Duvall brilliantly plays Sergeant Prendergast, a mild mannered police detective stuck behind the desk who also happens to be retiring from the Los Angeles Police Department at the end of the day. In a way, he is the opposite of Foster, but he too has is problems of his own. He is henpecked by his unstable and neurotic wife who wants him to retire from the LAPD early to move away from Los Angeles, his only daughter died many years ago from unknown causes, other police officers such as the arrogant and obnoxious Detective Lydecker (D.W. Moffett) treat him with contempt including his own commanding officer Captain Yardley (Raymond J. Barry) who openly admits he never liked him and the only person that sticks by Prendergast is friend and ally Detective Torres (Rachel Ticotin). Although it is his last day before retirement, Sergeant Prendergast is determined to find Foster before he causes more harm to others and before he reaches his ex-wife and child. Towards the end Prendergast eventually stands up for himself, shutting everyone up, and while he shows everyone that he is a good cop and decent person at heart he does so without lashing out violently unlike Foster.While audiences can empathise with many of the problems Foster encounters, the movie certainly does not glorify or condone vigilantism, breaking the law, violent behaviour, and bigotry, contrary to what some people believe. Michael Douglas' character William Foster is certainly not a hero in this movie, instead he is the villain and the victim, and shows the audience that he is a sad and broken individual that is past the point of no return.Joel Schumacher has had a mixed career as a director (he almost killed the Batman franchise with the 1997 flop Batman and Robin), but without question Falling Down is his best movie to date. Falling Down is very underrated and while certainly not for everyone, it deeply explores the many social themes shown in the movie and provides us with many thoughts.10/10",Falling Down
113,stevenrotherforth,One of the best films to come out of the 90's,10,28 March 2019,"Falling DownFalling Down is a forgotten gem from the 1990's.
A movie that doesn't get enough praise and in my opinion should now be regarded as a classic.
Masterfully directed by Joel Schumacher long before he sullied his reputation with the awful Batman movies.
This film features a career best performance by Michael Douglas.
The story tells of a unemployed defence worker who becomes increasingly frustrated by the flaws in today's society.
Douglas's character who is known only as D-fens
slowly crumbles as he struggles to make his way across Los Angeles to make it in time for his daughters birthday party.
With strong support from Robert Duvall who plays Detective Prendergast. A man on his last day before retirement.
Prendergast begins to track De-fens's exploits as the crimes begin to stack up across LA.
As aforementioned this film is masterfully directed.
The opening scene is superb. We are first greeted with laboured breathing as the camera focuses closely on Douglas's face. Lathered with perspiration as he slowly bakes inside his own automobile.
The LA heat is stifling and we the audience feel it too.
The camera pans around a heavy traffic jam as D-fens becomes more and more agitated.
This is movie making gold.
Why? Well whenever a director can make the audience feel what the character is feeling onscreen then this is indeed masterful.
We feel the tension that D-fens is experiencing right before he snaps and abandons his vehicle.
Falling Down is littered with such clever narration.
It's a film with excellent pacing. As one thing leads to another and D-fens slowly loses grip on normality.
Falling Down is a serious and believable movie. Only the scene with the bazooka falls into cartoon territory.
We the audience invest because although we know that D-fens's actions are wrong we feel his frustrations.
We've all been that person in the burger restaurant who wants breakfast five minutes too late.
We've all felt at some point robbed and cheated by society but rational human beings just dust themselves off and deal with it responsibly .
D-fens takes a different approach. One that would get you or I jailed or shot.Falling Down also benefits from some keen character development.
Duvall's character is supremely fleshed out giving him the complexities of a real human being.
Prendergast is a man unfulfilled in his work. At home he has a demanding and needy wife. At work his colleagues don't respect or value him. Retirement is a way out but not really the one he wants to take.
There's no cardboard cut out characters here.
Schumacher allows his film to blossom, he allows his cast to grow.
He has shot his movie in such a way that we feel connected to those onscreen.
But not just to the characters but to the environment too. We feel the heat and desperation.D-fens is a character that in a way we root for even if his actions are wrong.
(Spoiler alert) when he meets his sad and tragic end it is painful and upsetting to watch.
Sure he's a disturbed human being but all the same we can sympathise with him. His frustrations boil over and out of the screen.
After all he just wants to be with his little girl on her birthday.Falling Down is a superb film. One that I'm glad I revisited and one that I will continue to watch again and again.",Falling Down
114,ronbell-23984,Classic,10,19 January 2021,"Original and great. The ending was obviously predictable if you were expecting anything else I'd be surprised. More to the point it's got a huge dose of reality, everyone has a breaking point.",Falling Down
115,avik-basu1889,"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore !!!",7,4 July 2017,"For what it is, 'Falling Down' is a very well made, brilliantly acted, effective film. But I think it could've been better had a few things been tweaked just a little in the narrative. I think the story element of William's past aggression against his wife and daughter only harms the film. Without that element, the film would've just been about an ordinary working class every-man who reaches boiling point and lashes out against the unfairness of society. Most of the issues William raises and complains against during his murderous rampage are genuine issues that every ordinary citizen is afflicted with and can understand. Without his inherent and massive flaw, the question that each viewer is asking himself/herself which is 'Should I be rooting for this bloke?' would've been far more compelling. The domestic violence angle just kills the moral dilemma as the film answers that question for you. This is exactly why I love 'Fight Club' as it had the conviction to raise very genuine working class issues as well as show the disastrous effects of indiscreet violent rebellion without trying to glorify or vilify the protagonists.Having said that, I have to again mention that 'Falling Down' is a very enjoyable watch. Right from the first scene, Joel Schumacher makes the viewer feel the scorching L.A. heat radiating off the screen. The camera is fluid and Schumacher makes use of interesting colourful texture to make L.A. a living breathing character in the film.Michael Douglas is brilliant. It's a very politically incorrect character, so an actor needs a compelling personality to make the character engrossing. Duvall is also good as Prendergast who is the sort of the mirror opposite of William.So this is a good film and worth recommending, but it has a weakness, the absence of which would've made the film great.",Falling Down
116,theshadow908,A blunt look at the stresses of everyday life.,8,24 April 2006,"The reason I like this movie so much is because every single incident that annoys Bill Foster (Michael Douglas) in this movie is absolutely true to life. Variety stores DO overprice items. Fast food restaurants DO false advertise with the pictures on their menus. Construction companies DO work on streets that don't need work. Falling Down tells the story of a defence worker that has been laid off. He notices all these little things wrong with his city and he finally snaps, going on a violent rampage through the city. He's only trying to get home for his daughter's birthday.Michael Douglas does great as a man at the end of his rope. He is able to portray the emotions of an irritated man, an angry man, and an emotionally disturbed man. He pulls off the role very well, and it is in fact one of his best. Robert Duvall also does amazingly well in his role as a cop on his last day of the job, desperately trying to stop Bill Foster before he walks off the job.A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that because Joel Schumacher directed Batman and Robin that he's a terrible director. WRONG! It was just a mistake. He shows some great directing skills here. The cat and mouse feeling throughout between Douglas and Duvall is great. I also loved the music used in the movie. This is a great movie for entertainment, but it also has a strong message to it. Great movie.8/10",Falling Down

We are talking about society, the world we are living in, a place that has no presents for those who walk in line and that's what Michael Douglas understood one day. Being in a traffic jam he looses his nerves steps out and then starts terryfying the streets and in some situations you just think ""bloody right!"". Just take the scene in the hamburgerrestaurant in where Douglas shoots the roof to pieces because the picture from the hamburger isn't totally the hamburger you see that you've bought...all words are sublime (honestly said some pieces are quite racistlike) and the performance of Michael Douglas is outstanding, his best role ever.

119,mOVIemAN56,One of Schumacer's Best,9,15 April 2005,"First of all I must give kudos to Joel Schumacher for this unbelievable film. William Foster (Michael Douglass)is down on his luck. He is an unemployed over-educated defense worker in LA. After he begins to see faults in society he decides he is going to break a restraining order from his wife and go and see her and his daughter. He doesn't ask for trouble but soon is faced with it from various people just looking to put down problems. After he destroys a convenient store over a can of Coke, Officer Prendergast (Robert Duvall) begins to hunt across town, following a series of rampage left behind by Foster. Foster is the clear example of a troubled person who just wants to be happy but can't find it. As he lashes out against people in his way, you realize what he really wants, just to go home for his daughter's birthday. The film is impressive on many standards. First it is a film that doesn't involve a young, hateful teenager lashing out but an educated, respected man doing so. The dark sides of LA are visually expressed stunningly and each scumbag he comes across you feel right with him as he yells or punches him.The film is a tad violent but still is well done. Douglass and Duvall perform perfectly and the combination of certain personalities in each character caught my eye as this being one of the first movies I've seen to do that.Falling Down.

Few of us have really been in this position, but Falling Down is a fascinating portrayal of a man who finds the stresses of life become overbearing and begins a struggle of rebellion against everyday life.Michael Douglas is Bill Foster, or De-Fens as his car licence plate says, who decides to wage a one-man protestation of everyday facets of life he deems unfair and irrational, like the man who tries to charge him 85 cents for a simple can of soda. Aspects like this have launched him into a rage - how will it develop?As Foster, Douglas is as brilliant as he always is. He manages to conceptualise violence effectively but also includes plenty of sympathy so the viewer relates with his plight.As the cop on his tail, Prendergast, Bobby Duvall is a master of the doormat - the nice-guy cop who commands little respect from those around him, yet *is* liked by the vast majority of them.Directed at a pounding pace, and with great characterisation, this is a cracking thriller no DVD collection should be without.Top marks.",Falling Down

You can definitely relate to some of these frustrating situations he encounters in the movie but the thought of a person having the potential to actually do most of these things must be a fear for everyday Americans.

It is much more about our crazy modern world, its crazy contradictions, its crazy rules and rituals, this crazy world which drives ordinary people mad, and William Foster is just such an ordinary guy. ""World"" is perhaps going a bit far, we are talking Los Angeles area here.The film has truly disturbing moments.  Very memorable is the golf course sequence in which Foster is being abused for trespassing and our ""D-Fense"" responds by giving the two golf players the shock of their lives.

He proceeds to accidentally rob more than one place along his journey. The Korean businessman was first when Douglas trashes his place because he is upset with his prices. Then his hilarious run in with those Hispanic gangsters, during which he somehow takes their guns.

In fact, it's nothing more than a manipulative, violent melodrama about one geek's meltdown.

Everyone he encounters rubs him the wrong way--and a fine lot of stereotypes they are, from threatening ghetto punks to rude convenience store owners to a creepy white supremacist--and he reacts violently in every case. As he walks across L.A. (now there's a concept), cutting a bloody swath, he's being tracked by a cop on the verge of retirement (Robert Duvall).

132,peeedeee-94281,Not Quite 'I'm Mad As Hell...' or 'Taxi Driver of the 90s',5,14 November 2020,"I remembered enjoying this when seeing it in the theater back in the day. I think like most, it was the 'I'm mad as hell, and I won't take it any more' storyline. A man driven to his wits end, and then takes matters into his own hands.
Well, I decided to revisit the film recently, and I think seeing the world evolve over 25 years later, the movie doesn't quite hold the same charm.
One thing I noticed was that there was a lot of comedic banter that felt out of place in this movie, or it dragged on too long. In other words, the movie couldn't quite keep it's tone, it was dark, but there were some humor elements, but they didn't quite work together. It felt more like a battle between the two. Schumacher didn't quite have the skill to make it work. Strange, there was a scene set in a fast food restaurant that I don't recall if I thought was cringe worthy at the time. D Fens (Michael Douglas) has a gun, and pretty much intimidates everyone in that restaurant with it. I would have thought a scene like that would be in bad taste, considering the mass shooting that happened in a McDonald's less than 10 years earlier. I think that one bothered me more now than when Falling Down came out, maybe because of all the mass shootings/murders we've had in the years since then.
Having D Fens picking up a new weapon after each encounter, felt like a video game. Unintentionally funny. Upgrading his weapon - first no weapon, then baseball bat, then switchblade, then a bag of guns. The final upgrade was the bazooka, which is used in a painfully bad comedic scene, before he finally gets 'home'.
Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall are their usual great selves. I just wish they had better material to work with.
Ultimately, DFens was really a psychologically damaged individual who went on a rampage and probably was going to kill his family. Not a hero, not even an anti-hero. You can see he was a bully from the old home movies he watches. He blames everyone for his problems, but they might ultimately be his fault. And that's also where the weakness of the movie lies. Is D Fens a genuinely bad guy, or did he have a terrible upbringing that led him to be socially damaged. They show his mother as a somewhat quirky character, but there's not much background or character development for D Fens. Robert Duvall's character, on the other hand, had a lot of background and development. It also felt like there was foreshadowing of his fate, almost as if the plan was to have him die. But then maybe the director had a change of heart at the last minute.
So, while I think this movie has some good points, and does illustrate the pains of modern society and trying to fit in, it fails in the execution of the plot and muddles the message (if there was one). Not quite a 'Taxi Driver of the 90s'",Falling Down
133,Bento_de_Espinosa,Wonderful idea unsatisfactorily executed,5,27 September 2014,"This is the kind of movie that in the hands of a good director would have been fantastic! Unfortunately here it's full of stereotypes and clichés. Most of the acting is over the top, not natural and therefore not believable. Dialogues are cheesy, people don't normally talk like this.The subject is a very serious matter and should have stayed like that, but the director thought it would be cool to embed some jokes or funny situations, which almost ruined the movie, because not funny and don't match with its spirit. The worst part is that not a single character is likable. In reality up to the middle of the movie one feels some kind of sympathy for the main character, because at first he looks like a weird but actually decent guy who just can't take it anymore, but then he too starts to over-egg the pudding and becomes a pain in the ass. At the beginning the policeman seems to be a considerate cop, but at the end turns out to be as one-dimensional as all others. The parallel story with his grumpy wife is completely dispensable, since it adds nothing to the plot.Watchable, but somehow a bit flawed.",Falling Down

That feeling last the entire movie. You feel guilty because he's doing bad things and it doesn't feel right but that feeling is the mark of a great movie.,Falling Down
135,headhunter46,Most of us have been near the end of our rope at least once. This is your story.,8,2 February 2018,"Previously I had only seen clips of this movie on YT. So I decided to rent it from a store so I could see the whole thing.At first I was laughing at the antics, kind of identifying with how a guy pushed too long and far could get so PO'd he might get crazy and do some of those things.Bill, the main character played by Michael Douglas is just fed up. We don't know all the details at the beginning, but we see him abandon his car in a traffic jam and walk away. He just doesn't care what happens to it. As events unfold we learn of the issues that brought him to this point. One of them being, when you feel like everything is screwed up and will never get better, what have you go to lose? He goes into a shop and asks for change but is told he has to buy something. The shop owner is not the least bit friendly and this is just one of the issues that has been annoying our unseemly hero. He loses it and does a lot of damage in the shop with a ball bat he ripped away from the shopkeeper. Then he pays for the coke he had on the counter and leaves. He felt justified for busting up the store due to the owners calloused treatment of him, but he is not a thief. This man who has never been aggressive in his whole life is now finding it within himself to inflict violence on those who represent the issues that have put him in the situation he is currently dealing with. Bill will be confronted by some characters that would normally make a person like him nervous. He is small of frame, not tall, not muscular. He has short hair and he is wearing a white dress shirt and tie with several pens stuffed into a pocket protector. He looks like a geek. But he is so beaten down, so annoyed with it all, he is not scared. He tries to makes sense to two bad dudes who want to rob him but when they won't listen he goes berserk and beats the hell out of them with the bat and the briefcase they planned to steal. In the process, he takes possession of a knife they left behind. Evidently driving off his attackers makes him feel a bit empowered but not yet aggressive. Later on we will learn his ex-wife has a restraining order on him because she says he scared her. She admits to the police who come to assist her that he had never hurt her, the daughter, or the dog. Is she just a very easily frightened person and has she contributed to make him what he has become? Or did she see something a bit scary in him long before others could see it?As the movie proceeds Bill goes through a succession of steadily increasingly violent confrontations, sometimes not of his own making. When a gang tries to shoot him down, he stands calmly at a pay phone while bullets hit all around him even taking down innocent bystanders. Evidently gang bangers aren't very good shots. Bill calmly walks around the corner and finds they crashed their car in their haste to escape. Guess they are lousy drivers too. He finds a gym bag full of guns and intimidates one of the wounded bangers by waving gun at him and saying, ""You missed"". Before he leaves he shoots him in the leg for good measure. Here we see his level of aggression elevate another notch upward.When he goes to a diner and can't order breakfast because they stopped making it that is just too much for Bill who is now beginning to feel good about his retributions. Even though it doesn't show on the outside, inside his brain is spinning. And now with a bag full of guns he is really feeling empowered. When he accidentally puts a few shots through the roof of the building he is not the least bit fazed, he simply explains it as a sensitive trigger. then when he finally gets his food he tells them it is a lousy excuse for the one in the picture. Which too often is true of the food we get. Most viewers begin to feel as I did, that Bill is a social justice warrior. To see the frightened look on the faces of people similar to ones who have treated us unfairly is refreshing. Bullies, rude service personnel, etc. We like him because he is doing what we sometimes wish we could do but we don't because we fear legal repercussions. We are too civilized to treat rude people the way they deserve. We learn that all he wants to do is visit with his daughter on her birthday. He is fed up with the system keeping him away from her. It appears he has not seen her in three to four years. All of the things he runs into are just distractions interfering with his plan to see his daughter.There is a man picketing, protesting against a loan company he feels unfairly treated. They refused him a loan because they claimed he is, ""Economically unviable"". The man is wearing a white shirt and tie just like our man Bill. The big difference is, he is a black man, not white.Eventually Bill encounters a shopkeeper who appears even more whacked out than Bill. At first he befriends Bill, even protects him from police who by this time are searching for him in his white shirt. But then the shopkeeper turns against him when even screwed up psychotic Bill sees the evil in him. The shopkeeper tries to handcuff him but Bill finds the knife left behind by his first confrontation and stabs the guy in the shoulder. At first we feel it was justified, the man was purely evil. But then when Bill shoots the guy, we begin to see it is not social justice, Bill is becoming dangerous. The police officer played by Robert Duvall, who is retiring the day all this is happening is picking up on all these clues about the strange man in the white shirt and tie. He sees the escalation in a way the average viewer may not recognize. He knows Bill is increasingly capable of violence. We don't want to admit Bill could be evil because we sort of like how he is putting people in their place. But the killing of the shopkeeper should have been a red flag.Bill eventually makes his way to the home of ex-wife where he is NOT supposed to be. He is violating a court order. The wife and daughter fled the house when she realized he was right close in their neighborhood. All I could see at that point was a man desperate to see a daughter he hadn't seen in years. Later, Duvall, and his partner make it to the house, Bill wounds the partner in his escape. She is only wounded slightly in the side so we might not see it as intent to kill. But later as Bill accidentally finds his wife and daughter out on a fishing pier, Duvall finds them together and makes the point that he thinks our Bill was planning to kill the wife and daughter. Suddenly it hit me like a brick. I just thought Bill wanted to see the daughter for her birthday but now we are introduced to the possibility Bill has a terrible dark side. Was he really planning to kill them? Did he just want to see them? We have read in the news of instances where angry men have killed their whole family. We may never know for sure because the movie ends with Bill forcing a shootout with Duvall because he can't imagine life behind bars. And he mentions that his daughter will get his life insurance so that gives us reason to hope he really wasn't going to kill wife and child, or was he? The shootout sort of gives Bill some vindication as the gun he claimed to have was a bright blue water pistol.This movie touched on a wide variety of issues and social injustices maybe that's why I liked it so much.",Falling Down

This film brings reality to that nonsense, it portrays the mental breakdown affecting one of those lucky ones. It's a changing world, marriages break down, jobs are insecure and there's no respect of anyone any more. Our protaganist is possibly a control freak, he maintains some elements of civil behaviour whilst slowly losing more and more self control.It's a great film with a great cast and story, a definite should if not must watch.",Falling Down
137,richspenc,Loss of sanity caused by a man who lost his way,9,1 March 2016,"Michael Douglass has already become unstable in the first scene he's in when he's sitting in his car, hands firmly on the wheel and looking very frustrated. His first moments of really snapping come in the first ten minutes of the film when he first, jumps out of his car in the middle of traffic jammed LA highway. Then, he goes off the rails in a Korean owned convenience store when the Korean first, refuses to break Douglas's dollar without purchase, and then, overcharges him for a 12 oz can of coke. Well, at least Douglas thinks he's being overcharged because he's totally obsessed with comparing corner store prices to what they were in the sixties. Douglas starts asking prices for individual random merchandise, and then smashes or breaks each item with a baseball bat when the Korean guy names the price, because Douglas finds each item much more expensive than it would've been in 1965. He has no ability to except inflation, how everything in America has been getting more expensive over the years. But Douglas's anger is more about him believing that the Korean store owner has raised prices to rob the American public including himself.Similar style situations carry on throughout the movie. Douglas feeling that he's being robbed or taken advantage of, and then handling it with the most extreme anger and even violence. We also learn that Douglas has lost his job and that his wife has put up a restraining order on him. This tells us that Douglas has already done some things in the past he shouldn't have done before the day where he hopped out of his car and started a walking wave of destruction. Douglad feels like his actions are necessary because they're for a just cause. In some situations though, it seems more like he's just defending himself such as when two Latino gang members are mugging him with a knife to his throat. He whacks them with a baseball bat only when it looks like it was in self defense because the only other option at that moment would've been to hand over his belongings. Later on, Douglas shoots and kills a Nazi surplus store owner, but only after he assaulted Douglas and had him pinned to the ground with a gun to his head. A lot of people here will argue if Douglas really did anything wrong in either of those circumstances because they both clearly seemed to be moves made in self defense. Other things Douglas did, however, were very clearly things that were definitely wrong and crazy moves of Douglas snapping such as when he pulled out a gun at a fast food restaurant because they stopped serving breakfast. Same with when Douglas shot a bazooka at a construction site just because they closed the road. Same with shooting a phone booth with a machine gun just because of some impatient jerk waiting to use the phone. Same with the Korean shop. They were all things that no sane, held together person would've done. So did Douglas break some laws that day? Absolutely. Big time. Were there better, more reasonable moves a man could've made who's tired of the pressures and injustices of modern society? Whos been made to feel obsolete or economically unviable? Absolutely.The police team on Douglas's case is led by Detective Prentagas (Robert Duvaul). He is on his last day on the force before retiring. Duvaul himself has felt some of the same pressures of society and also feels obsolete. But unlike Douglas, Duvaul has held it together and stayed on the right side of the law. Duvaul's captain has told him that he's worthless, so he handles it by showing a higher exceptional performance on the job. That's a better way of handling things than stealing baseball bats and guns and destructing or shooting at things. Duvaul shows his boss that he's gonna catch the Douglas character for all he's done, and he won't go home until he's done it, no matter how many times his wife bugs him to come home. His wife has been after him to retire, and that's the only reason he's doing it. His wife also is the one who made him get off the street and take the desk jocky job. His co workers and boss in return all think Duvaul is a coward. Catching Douglas is what Duvaul will do to prove them wrong. Duvaul will also choose not to retire yet and show that his wife is not the one who wears the pants in the family. See how both Douglas and Duvaul handle the pressures and injustices of society. One in a sane and legal way, and one not so.",Falling Down

This movie wasn't quite as absurd as ""The Game"" (where he gave another solid performance), but it was every bit as entertaining and impressive.Watching him take a vengeful walk through the pits of L.A., looking like he just left the control room of a 1960's Apollo mission, wreaking havoc on whoever tries to thwart his mission of seeing his estranged wife & child was downright riveting.I'd seen the movie in late '93 when it first came out on video, and it was better as a rewatch 17 years later. It really is a politically incorrect statement about everything L.A. was known for at that time (i.e.- racial tension, fast-food lunches, street ""con-artist"" people, gay-bashing, etc. we all saw from our little TV's in fly-over land).The other story line with Robert Duvall was a tad too ""we've all seen the cop on his last day at work"" to also believe, but it's really Mike's show here, and he should have gotten an Oscar nom. for this one.P.S.-Tuesday, I know they tried to make you look pathetic here, but your still tops in my book.

I think it's out of order.""Michael Douglas stars in ""Falling Down"", a classic tale of urban unrest, that's seen through the eyes of a man whose had enough of society and the ""scum"" that dwell within it. The events of this film are compressed into the span of a single day and essentially plays out as a continuously unfolding series of urban encounters, which usually result in violence and sometimes even murder; and yet all the while, it's almost always funny - and that's the real magic of this movie. When watching Falling Down you'll bare witness to Michael Douglas making his way through colorful downtown Los Angeles sweating and swearing as he goes, while sporting the patently unhip or ""sqaure"" look with the combination of a crewcut, dated horn-rim glasses, a white shirt and tie and of course a briefcase to complete the look. His goal in this movie is to reach the house of his ex-wife and to be there for his 5 year-old daughters birthday, but that's much easier said than done and Mike has one hell of a hard time getting there. As he experiences numerous encounters along the way, which span the range from mildly irksome to downright hostile - and all of which pack a lot of humor.Robert Duvall co-stars, along with Barbra Hershey as a pair of detectives who are on his trail throughout the majority of the movie, which cuts back and forth with scenes of Michael Douglas making messes and with Robert Duvall being there afterwards investigating the scene. Throughout the course of this nearly two hour-long film, we follow vigilante Mike, as he pinball's through the vast urban jungle that is L.A. Though unassuming in appearance, he has a great propensity for violence and his pent-up rage frequently boils over, leaving many victims in his wake. Take THAT, punk! The types of low-down characters that you can expect to see in this sprawling tale of urban unrest are: Hispanic gangbangers, ""Nick"" the Neo-Nazi army surplus store guy, smarmy price-gouging convenience store clerks, crooked road maintenance workers, bums in the park, nervous ""Whammy Burger"" employees, snotty elitist old golfers and road-ragin' yellin' types and of course the cop's. All of which eventually manage to cross paths with Mike on his merry way to his ex, whose house is out by the coast, which means he has a long and difficult trip through the city - that trip through bustling, sun-baked, L.A. constitutes 95% of the movie.Douglas' character is calm, collected and logical most of the time, but when needed to he readily bursts into a rage, which even when enraged he's cool in his actions - check out ""the phone booth scene"" as a testament to that. Great scene! And once the action is over he's frequently in the habit of talking smack and toying with his victims as they lay dying, which usually, in no small way, is due to their own wretched and often hostile behavior. I must say that I find it to be remarkably pleasurable and entertaining to watch Mike take on the endless waves of arrogant greaseball criminals and seeing them removed from the cities streets and to do so with such great style. This guy's a legitimate hero and in Falling Down, Michael Douglas takes out the trash! It's one colorful encounter after another that Mike's finds himself pulled into and that's the key reason why this film packs in such a high amount of deliciously dark humor. These encounters of his quickly establish a pattern of that of an unassuming looking white guy, who clearly has his own idea's of ""urban cleansing"" and is not at all afraid to implement his own unique method of population control.One other thing to take notice of during Michael Douglas's walking tour of L.A. is his weaponry, his tools-of-the-trade, which are constantly evolving throughout the course of the movie - first it's a baseball bat, then a butter-fly knife, then the bag-o-gun's and finally he gets his hands on a shoulder-fired rocket-launcher. All these toys make for a particularly lively (or deadly, depending on how you look at it) afternoon and the events that follow are extremely entertaining, to downright hilarious. Oh, and no, his daughter didn't get the snow-globe for her birthday, as he had intended.Once it's all said and done Falling Down is a remarkably entertaining film and try to keep in mind that this all happens during a single sunny afternoon in L.A. Falling Down is truly a grand-day-at-the-movies and should keep anyone with a pulse entertained from start to conclusion, as it effortlessly and energetically sustains it's nearly two hour length.With a much better actor in the lead-role Falling Down is very much like a more entertaining version of Death Wish, one that plays out in a much shorter time-span and whose crimes occur in broad daylight.

Obviously we're all sickened by their actions, but there's always moments when we wish we could do the same.The film, I thought, would be about this and started of well, the burger and the beggar's scene were very topical and accurate, but then the story started to fade.  They (Hollywood I presume) had to make Douglas out to be lunatic.  The film would have succeeded if they continued the trait of it just being a normal guy who'd had enough.The films' ending was a bit of a low and very depressing.  Overall it was disappointing that the film never really gathered pace.  Personally I would have liked to have seen more acts of violence and intolerance, then, for him to realise the inevitable outcome of his actions.In the end I didn't see any meaning in the film and I rather felt that Joel S. had to tow the 'Hollywood line' in the later stages of the film, this, for me spoilt would could have been a landmark film.5/10",Falling Down

Made unemployed from his job at a defence contractor and separated from his wife and daughter, he is stuck, stuck in traffic, stuck in his mother's house, stuck in an America that doesn't care for the average Joe, stuck in a mindset that cannot cope with the outside world. He decides on the hottest day of the year to leave it all behind and just get to his daughter's birthday party, but due to the people he meets this day he is just not gonna make it, as he decides to be a champion of the people and take on the very people who make are lives so unbearable for the rest of us.This film is one of those that is both good but frustrating as their is so much to like in it, from his handling of the common thugs who think that their violence makes them something special, to burger joints who present a picture of their burgers that is like some kind of Utopion vision when the reality is very often squidgy and unsatisfying and finally the bitter old men in Rupert Bear pants and tea cosy hats who walk round their golf courses hating everyone and everything, in spite of owning most of it.All of this is great and the sparring that D-Fens does throughout the film with Detective Pendergrast is very entertaining as he contends with similar problems to D-Fens but handles them all a hell of a lot better, the direction is great and tells the story really well, but the big problem with the film is the way that it cops out by making D-Fens a man with Psychotic tendencies before the story starts as we see in earlier scenes. As this is a Hollywood film it can't be an average man having a breakdown it has to be someone with mental issues already and that is what annoys. This could have been a better film if we felt that we were D-Fens but these issues remove him from us and dilutes the impact that it could have.That said it is still a good watch 8 out of 10",Falling Down

146,toqtaqiya2,"One of the best films of the 1990s, really. Should get more recognition.",7,29 July 2010,"Too bad I didn't get to watch this film earlier. It's really one of the best, most thought-provoking films of the 1990s. It's filled with ideas and sharp observations from the first scene to the last. At the beginning, when D-Fens is stuck in traffic, you really get to feel how stressful and numbing the situation is for him. The scene is shot in an unusual way, with a close focus on what's surrounding his small car. The last important scene is an emotional tour-de-force. Michael Douglas gives one of his best performances as William ""D-Fens"" Foster, a working class hero. He just wants to get home to see his family, but the ills of a big American city keep getting in his way. These confrontations are thrilling, but also funny in a black comedy kind of way. Douglas is really the heart of the film. Robert Duvall, however, is also impressive as Sergeant Martin Prendergast. His character is a reasonable man but with problems of his own. He has it better than D-Fens. Still, in a way he understands what D-Fens is going through. Falling Down reminded me of Come And See (1985), a great war film. It's structured just like that film, and just like that film it has a powerful ending. Maybe Falling Down was influenced by Come And See. Falling Down is one of several Hollywood films of the late 1980s and early 1990s that fall under the ""white man as a victim"" category. It's undoubtedly the best of them. In addition to the action it features beautiful cinematography. The neighborhoods that D-Fens passes through aren't exactly pretty, but they're photographed very well, and Andrzej Bartkowiak captures the look of a hot day perfectly. One of my favorite things about the film is that it has that early 1990s Hollywood look. I guess this is because of the cameras that were used at that time. Cameras these days capture colors perfectly, but the films end up looking too realistic, kind of dull I might say. Falling Down is great and entertaining. I highly recommend it.",Falling Down
147,timmy_501,"Cartoonish, violent journey through modern society",6,7 August 2010,"Falling Down is about Bill, a man who has lost all purpose in his life because he became estranged from his family and subsequently lost his job. Although Bill has a lot of screen time the film doesn't really explore his character with much depth. The idea seems to be that he has become disillusioned with modern society; nearly every person he meets is rude and deliberately unkind. This might have been more interesting if there was a possibility it might signify a skewed narrative subjectivity but any such ambiguity is wiped out by the subplot with Detective Pendergrast, a police officer one day away from retirement who not only happens to be in a uniquely perfect position physically and mentally to track and catch Bill but also has his own encounters with unnaturally hateful people.For the most part the film focuses on Bill's nightmarish encounters with modern society. Basically, the film sets up some easy targets such as uncooperative retail workers, lazy road crews, and violent gang members and barely manages to knock them down with its unconvincing criticisms. The problem here is not just that these ancillary characters are cartoonishly exaggerated; Bill's character isn't normal enough to be our guide through an environment that seems to be created to seem naturally hostile. His main character trait seems to be anger and he often appears to be seeking conflict as his encounters on his journey to his daughter's birthday party at his old house become increasingly violent and the body count steadily increases.On the upside Robert Duvall does an amazing job with his role of Detective Pendergrast, the character that gradually displaces Bill as the narrative completes its trajectory. The performance of Michael Douglass as Bill is somewhat less convincing but not necessarily bad. Another positive here is that this film isn't so serious that it becomes depressingly misanthropic, in fact it's the sort of work that has comedic moments that would likely seem more pronounced (and effective) on a second viewing. The best that can be said about Joel Schumacher's direction is that it only calls attention to itself a few times; this isn't a film with a particularly strong aesthetic. Still, a rapidly edited montage early on was intriguing enough to make up for the frequently heavy handed music cues.",Falling Down
148,au_law2001,What most people haven't realized...,10,2 March 2005,"This film about an angry defense worker laid off, now trying to get home to his daughter, whom he can't see anymore due to a trial, is a very compelling movie, and very thought provoking. But what bothers me, is the fact that some see him as a hero or voice of the everyday consumer, standing up for his rights. A few say the ending wasn't fitting, like it's saying to tell us to lay down and take it. Well, that isn't what this movie is all about. If you watch it a lot of times and listen between the lines, the story is all there. Even Joel Schumacher admitted that D FENS is not the hero but the villain. That's true! Why? Because he's lost it. That's why the title is called Falling Down, because that is exactly what is happening to him. He's falling from reality going insane every time a he passes humiliation. The truth and story of this film is that he blames everyone for what happened to him, as he has lost his job, and he can't see his daughter anymore. Even the video near the end says it all, that he was already disturbed when he was showing what a jerk he is, or the phone call to his wife, ""Did you know, Beth, that in some South American countries it's still legal to kill your wife if she insults you?"" He was threatening her, it was a sign he was ill from the beginning. Like when Pendegrast asks his mom where his daughter lives, she says something like ""He won't tell me, he blames me for what happened."" See? He lashes on anything because he thinks they are in his way, when he actually went to them, except for the Surplus salesman and gangsters. Or when he goes to the restaurant he gets a machine gun since he can't have breakfast, but he is late, it's his bad, can't he just accept that? And he wasn't supposed to cross the golf course because it said no trespassing. He did things that were foolish, thus leading to his own demise. You see, he thought he was right but he isn't supposed to use violence. And at the end, when he says ""I'm the bad guy? How did that happen? I helped build missiles. I helped protect this country. You should be rewarded for that. But instead they give it to the plastic surgeons, you know they lied to me."" He blames the plastic surgeons as well. That's the problem with people today, we blame others for our misfortune, and we don't even realize we're to blame. D-FENS blamed everyone for his lost, and does't realize he is at fault. He doesn't know how to ""let go"". That's what we all have a problem with, we just don't know how to ""let go"". And he thought that violence is the solution to problems when it isn't, you see, that is why the ending fits, it shows where it has taken him. But he really wanted to die, the Pendegrast was giving him a chance to live, but he wanted to die than face the music. This isn't a situation where he is the government and D-FENS is the little guy, no. It shows how lashing out to others and blaming others will get you. You reap what sow.",Falling Down

150,jbartelone,"Despite Minor Flaws, a Very Good Film!",8,2 April 2007,"Falling Down tells the story of a fired defense contractor with a hot fuse and a passion to execute violence when things don't go his way. Michael Douglas is OUTSTANDING in this role, with a very unpredictable personality. There are times when you compliment the guy for standing up for what he believes in, and while watching the same movie, you feel that he MUST pay the consequences for hurting, and in one case, killing a person.SPOILERS HERE: Bill Foster, (played by Douglas) is trying to get home to his daughter's birthday party. Robert Duvall plays the cop on his last day of work before retirement trying to stop him. There are some supporting roles worth a mention, such as Tuesday Weld, who plays Duvall's emotionally unstable wife, made worse by a tragedy in their own family. Barbra Hershey, plays Douglas' ex-wife who is looking for protection from her violent husband.Watch for several good stand-out scenes, the best involving Douglas going berserk at a fast-food burger joint. Much of what happens when Douglas is on-screen is predictable. However, he acts out the role so well, it is really reminiscent of watching say Jack Nicholson go into a slow descending rage. (He would have been just as good if not BETTER in this role!) But maybe he wasn't considered because he's getting too old. However, Douglas is THAT good in this role. When he is on screen you can't take your eyes off of him.The problem is that when he is not on screen, the film loses momentum. While an honest effort by the minor characters, they just aren't strong enough. The investigation and questioning by Duvall, his co-workers, the interviewed witnesses, takes too long to ""get going."" Meanwhile, the viewer is waiting for the action to go back to Douglas so that he can do his next ""crazy thing."" There also isn't enough material for Duvall's unstable wife, or Douglas' worried wife to work with. But it's a double edged sword. Had they BEEN given stronger story lines in the script, we wouldn't have been able to see Douglas in several good scenes.Because of this dilemma, I don't know what would have made Falling Down better. My best guess would be the following indicated below:There's just one or two little ingredients that are missing, which stop this film from being great. These are too many minor characters and not enough material for them to work with. However, this is still a highly recommended film and well worth seeing.",Falling Down
151,Doublej20005,A Great Thriller,8,29 January 2021,"A really intriguing thriller. I've never seen Michael Douglas in a non MCU film before, but he really impressed me here, and his performance essentially carries the film. Don't get me wrong, the script and direction is still good, but Douglas is just phenomenal here. Following his character as he 'goes about his day' was just really interesting, and the social points that are touched on still feel relevant. Obviously D-Fens isn't really a character you can sympathise with as such, but there are a lot of points about unfairness within society which are still relevant today, and it elevates the film a lot. The side plot with Robert Duvall's Police Officer isn't as interesting and felt a bit drawn out at times, but it is still enjoyable. The direction is good on the whole and the score is also another element that stood out to me. A couple of sexist elements and a slightly too slowly paced ending docks a few marks for me, but overall this was just a great film, and I'd definitely recommend it.",Falling Down

He's another version of the Michael Douglas character and they even dress the same---short-sleeve white shirt & tie. Both of them have been tossed aside by the system and at the end of the movie, D-Fens even adopts the title, calling himself ""not economically viable."" It's an example though of clever writing and proof that there's no such thing as a small part in a play or movie. The actor who is ""Not Economically Viable Man"" is unforgettable in this role and he plays a crucial part in advancing and explaining the story. You could have an entire movie just about his character and it would probably be just as interesting as the D-Fens character.",Falling Down

I love Joel Schumacher's work a lot. He's an highly underrated director and he has made many amazing movies. ""Tigerland"" and ""Phone Booth"" are my two favourites, but I liked ""Flatliners"", ""Flawless"" and ""8MM"" a lot as well. ""Falling Down"" was quite an extraordinary movie also with a nice performance by Michael Douglas.Everyone knows what it is about: a guy who is completely freaked out. Besides Douglas is Robert Duvall the other famous name relied to this movie. He is a police officer on his last day. The story is very well written and the acting performances are excellent.""Falling Down"" is an entertaining movie, but it won't become my favourite Schumacher-movie I think.

155,unakaczynski,One for the downtrodden.,9,30 December 2005,"Falling Down Drama Ever have one of those days where you just must've woken up on the wrong side of the bed and every little thing just seems to irritate the hell outta you until you just can't handle it all anymore and pretty soon yah snap?And then, you feel really refreshed for a moment And then everything just gradually, somehow, incredibly gets worse?That's Falling Down. ""A Tale of Urban Reality."" Michael Douglas stars as the guy that just can't take it anymore. But he doesn't just snap. He calmly goes berserk through Los Angeles. All he wants to do is see his little girl on her birthday. So he walks away from his car, leaving it stranded on a busy highway so he can meander through the city to go see his daughter. And along the way, he meets countless interesting jerks and pricks and gradually takes revenge on the world that has so thoroughly screwed him and left him broken. Robert Duvall plays ""the desk cop on his last day"" who's seeing connections between spots of random lunacy as they crop up in a straight line in the city. It's all uphill from there, right?Here's the breakdown:The Good:--This is a rare film and one to be applauded for it's stark raving visualization of a broken-down middle-aged white man. In this day and age of rampant, raging political correctness, here we have a film following someone screwed by the systemwho isn't a minority. It lends to the idea that society itself has dealt the protagonist a mighty blow. Okay, to some people, this sounds stupid, I've met them. ""Oh the poor white man!! (sarcasm, followed by:) Who gives a f*ck?"" Well, for one, white guys that have lived in a system that prides itself on helping everyone but heterosexual healthy white malesthe ones blamed for everyone else's misfortunesthis is a film of pride and sorrow. It hits home. Down on your luck and it just gets worse and no one wants to fight for youthe white man. Left to fend for yourself in a system increasingly against youthe white man. No more luck and no way out. So, granted, this film has a small audience, but that doesn't lessen the impact of the storyand that's my top spot here for The Goodthis film has some balls on it.--Within about five minutes, your eyes widen and you wonder just how far this film will go to show how on the end of his rope, Michael Douglas's character, known only as D-FENS is. The outburst he exhibits from being charged 85 cents for a can of pop gets the movie off to a great startone which helps hold attention.--Excellent acting through and through. Douglas hits all the right notes and buttons from agitation to confusion, he exhibits, not just traits growing in our modern, busy-as-hell yuppie white middle-aged males, but also a frustration that can be shared by most all people for the little things here and there that pick and bite at our stress tolerances.--Surprising, shocking, and funny scenes crop up throughout the filmthough they aren't ""ha ha"" funny so much as they are very entertaining. Just watch the scene in Whammy Burger and tell me that's not as funny as it is tense.--Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall are both top notch in their performances. We have quite a bit of depth in both of them and get to know them quite well. We're introduced to their minds and ways and the problems they've experiences which have dominated their lives and the different ways they've handled all that life has done to them.--Some great dialog, simply beautiful. No, the words aren't pretty, but the phrases really grab your attentionand several are really quite amusing. ""What's that? Pills? You're pills are in the cart? Well what can I do? Now aren't you sorry you didn't let me pass through your golf course? And now you're gonna die wearing that stupid little hat.""Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The music and cinematography are about average, nothing overly special.--The ""desk cop out to solve one last mystery"" does feel kind of cliché, however, Robert Duvall carries the character extremely welland is immensely likable. Both main characters are done so well that part of me rooted for one and part of me rooted for the other. Perhaps, in the end maybe they could ""get each other?""The Bad:--Like I said, this really feels like a film to grant some strength and pride to white guys as well as sympathize with them. I've personally had my own ""screwing over by the system,"" so this film still resonates with me. But a lot of people will just be annoyed by the message and tale.The Ugly:--Some possible stereotyping going on here and there. Nothing major.--That Nazi is quite a fellow. Quite a slimy fellow.Memorable Scene:--""But I want to order breakfast""""I'm sorry, but we stopped serving breakfast a few minutes ago.""Acting: 9/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 (it's hard to do gunshots wrong, nothing major) Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 (nothing to note) Violence/Gore: 6/10 (some violence, no gore) Dialogue: 10/10 Music: 6/10 Direction: 9/10 Cheesiness: 1/10 Crappiness: 0/10 Overall: 9/10I really enjoy this film, pretty much everything about it is entertaining and eye-catching. But then, hey, I'm a white male with a problem with ""the system"" these days. So of course it appeals to me. I'll recommend it, but be warned, it's a good movie but not for everyone. It's kind of a ""dude flick"" for disenfranchised, angry white guys. Top notch performances from Douglas and Duvall.

Just entertainment instead?Great acting from Douglas, whose character has lost his job, lost his wife and home, hasn't told his mother about the job nor where his wife and child are. But the whole story is basically awful. And I wonder if the main role had been played by a non-white actor, would America's opinion of the movie be totally different? Unforgiving? Probably.The ""Storyline"" on the IMDb page for Falling Down sums it up quite well. Great support actors too, especially the women, who don't seem to have done much in other movies? I rate it as high as 6 for the acting and there are some memorable lines (see the quotes page) and the production and direction are good too.

They're great, Robert Duvall especially, but this is Douglas's movie. This is his role of a life-time. SPOILER: The plot is ridiculously simple: A man get's fed up with life, and he goes his own way, all the way to his ex-wife's and his daughter's birthday party. Complications occur, since the life of Douglas does not fit the niche of today's society.Douglas character is so cool, and his lines are great. He does everything we all want to do at some point in life. Although he seems psychotic and brutal, we still root for him and hope he will succeed in his quest.This movie is not for the queasy.

But in any case Falling Down is still a good film with a good performance by Douglas as D-Fens who plays a laid-off Government Defence worker who gets up ever day for work except there is no work to go to. He feels pushed aside by society that he says he helped protect and one hot summer day on the LA freeway he finally breaks down and abandons his car and walks away. After he does this he comes across many different kinds of people from all walks of life from a Korean store owner, a Neo-Nazi military surplus store owner, a bum in a park looking for money, Mexican gang-bangers,grumpy road construction workers, rude workers in a fast food restaurant and a ex-wife that nags him and will not let him see his only daughter. All of these people D-Fens encounters throughout the film and after each encounter he looses it more and more. We feel and understand his frustration at a society that moves too fast, is way too tolerant on criminals, where English is becoming a second language in America, illegal immigration overrunning our cities, deadbeats who don't want to work and where just basic manners are all but forgotten. We cheer him on for example when he trashes the Korean man's store cause he was being overpriced for a can of soda or when he shoots one of the scum-bad gang bangers. We come to identify with him and his outrage and we understand what pushed him over the edge.Robert Duvall plays the cop who is close to retiring but the case of D-Fens gets his attention and so he stays on to catch the man that is running amok in the city. In a way Duvall is a lot like D-Fens who has become numb to what is happening around him and how society is changing but you feel he has learned to live with it and play the game. I will not give the ending away except to say that there is a show-down between Duvall and D-Fens at the end that was disappointing.The problem I have with this film is that at times it did not take itself serious enough and as a result it became a bit silly in a few scenes. An example is when D-Fens gets his hands on a rocket launcher and finds himself in a position that he decides to use it. He does not know how and so a young boy who just so happens to be passing by shows him how its done. Unbelievable and it just took some of the Punch out of the film.But besides that this film does make you think about where we are as a society, and just how lose a canon we all can be and what we are able to deal with. Most if us do deal with it in frustration and are able to go about our daily lives. As Duvall's character does. Some however like D-Fens are the loose canons that can't.",Falling Down

Our lives are full of constant work and it's difficult to always enjoy the true sentiments of life when we are indulged in it. Sometimes we forget our purpose and dreams in life—what makes us happy and excited—and end up waiting idly on the side, watching the world pass us by and wonder: what is going on? William (Michael Douglas) has already lost everything: his wife, his daughter, his dog and his home. His marriage and relationships have all broken apart and all he wants to do now is see his daughter on her birthday. It appears as though the entire world is turning on him and won't even allow him see his daughter, but he tries valiantly anyways. In the midst of all this he sees flaws in society and now attempts to give back to the world but struggles to express himself appropriately in this virtue. Although harsh, William reflects the extremes we keep bottled within us that we try to tame. No one's perfect. We all have our own battles, and once hope is taken away from us, it's hard to see that light at the end of the tunnel. It's hard to return to earlier days when everything was once safe, calm and perfect. We long for that day, hoping that's what tomorrow will bring, but sometimes we have to make our own destiny. It's tough not knowing what to expect tomorrow, let alone knowing you're losing everything that ever meant something to you. When it looks like the world is your enemy, it's hard to remember we're all just people trying to live good lives. We often forget to live our finite lives to the fullest, thinking there will always be another day.

161,Jim-500,"Good idea, bad execution",5,4 October 1999,"Who can't identify with William Foster (Michael Douglas), whose twig snaps one day in the middle of a traffic jam?  Foster is fed up with all of 1990s' travails, including traffic jams, high prices, and the general malaise of a society that isn't living up to the false promises provided by a media that tend to romanticize the past rather than report it.  He goes on a one-man rampage to try to right this wrong, highlighted by a speech inside of a small store where he declares that he wants all the prices to be what they were in 1964.  He also gets more than a little upset when, inside of a fast-food joint, he is told that he cannot eat breakfast because he has arrived just a few minutes after they stopped serving breakfast.These are clever plot ideas that the American Everyman can identify with. What we can't identify with, however, is the notion that given these frustrations, it's alright to pick up a high-powered weapon and start to shoot people.  This is where the movie goes wrong.  Sure, I hate sitting in traffic jams, and would love to simply abandon the car and start walking. Sure, I'd love to bring my childhood back with 1960s' prices.  And I'd love to give the McDonald's manager a piece of my mind because I missed his artificial deadline for breakfast (""I'm hungry, dammit!  I want to give you my money so you can serve me breakfast!  What's wrong with that?"").But I, and I daresay most people would not resort to gun-toting violence as Douglas does.  As he starts to pick off people and destroy property, my ability to identify with his character quickly waned.  By the middle of the movie, he had become just another movie psycho that I didn't care about.One scene that goes terribly wrong is in the fast-food restaurant, where Douglas has just missed the breakfast deadline.  This could have been a funny, perceptive scene, holding a mirror up to a silly society that says you can't have breakfast after a certain time.  But once the violent element comes in, it's no longer funny, it's sick.  And it's all the more sick since at the time the movie was made, the country had had a rash of shootings where gunmen indiscriminately walked into McDonald's restaurants and killed people, including children.  The filmmakers should have known better.(One other minor point: throughout the movie, Foster is identified only as ""D-FENS"", which is the name on his vanity plate (he works for the defense industry).  It turns him into a faceless, non-human persona, which fits his character and adds a bit of poetry to the screenplay.  But by the end of the movie, he is being called by his real name. Roger Ebert incorrectly reported that throughout the entire movie he is only referred to as D-FENS.  It should have been that way.)""Falling Down"" has a good premise; it could have been a great sociological study of American society.

Michael Douglas gives a really strong performance as the lead, but I think that the star of the show is Schumacher. His direction is really something. All the way through you have the feeling that something really bad is about to happen, and when bad stuff is happening you get the feeling it's about to get worse. The tension is incredible. Despite the setting in the streets of L.A. Schumacher still makes you feel extremely claustrophobic, like you can't get away. It's the perfect length and the plot moves along at a decent pace. I can overlook the slightly predictable ending because the film obviously has a lot to say socially. It is essentially a psychological analysis of an everyday man who has snapped under the pressures of society. Other social outcasts are also featured, though in different ways- young gangsters, victims of economic downturn, and even one Nazi.

The film shows Bill coming across various characters in society and him dealing with them. Sometimes in rather humorous ways.In an interesting sub plot Robert Duvall's character is the cop following Bill's illegal activity/crimes on his last day of work before retiring. It's shown as well his character has gotten pushed around a lot in his life and has reasons like D-Fens or Bill to lash back out.I could say as a white working class guy I could empathize with Bill to a certain extent but would never go that far.

Michael Douglas succeeds in portraying the exasperation of the main character with astonishing wit and verve.The supporting cast is excellent also and the sharp contrast between the protagonist and the more or less peacefully disturbed policeman-a superb Robert Duvall-adds an extra dimension to the general theme.Barbara Hershey is, as always, extremely attractive and convincing.",Falling Down

'Falling Down' is only hollow, glossy Hollywood hokum, but it expects the audience to believe that it is tackling serious issues head on, which I suppose it does up to a point, but the result is unsatisfying, and frankly, one big cop-out.The film was directed by Joel Schumacher, and stars Michael Douglas with Barbara Hershey, Robert Duvall, and in a miniscule part as Duvall's wife, Tuesday Weld, a classic example of a fine actress wasted by the Hollywood system. But that's another story. The problems of this film begin with the conception of its main character, Bill Foster (Michael Douglas). The first half of the film's footage involves Foster leaving his car behind in the middle of a traffic jam and walking around aimlessly in Travis Bickle fashion trying to figure out what the city of Los Angeles has finally been reduced to. A lot of ranting goes on about the parlous state of the American nation with a number of pointless characters to ram it home to the audience that modern day Los Angeles is merely a microcosm of the deplorable state of the rest of the country. Douglas, in a very brave performance is from the outset characterised as a complete nut so there is little suspense and even less point to his childish and pointless rampage.Within the first twenty minutes it's revealed that Foster has been retrenched from his government job; he has also been divorced, but nevertheless is a fine upstanding American. (The only proof we have of this is his run in with a bikie gun fascist in a rifle shop in which Foster routs him and castigates him for not being American enough.) The only thing Foster seems to believe is that the system has screwed him, so he decides, 'to take action'. This consists of shooting up a Korean mixed business so that the owner runs out on the street screaming and terrified, getting rid of some roadside workers with a stray bazooka because they're holding up the traffic and terrorising a group of elderly golfers so that one of them has a heart attack and dies. All this mayhem because he's been stuck in a traffic jam in downtown L.A.! Naturally Foster's behaviour attracts the attention of the police, and they attempt to second guess what he's going to do next, but since the guy does not have all his marbles, this becomes a difficult prospect. By the second half of the film, the director dumps his audience like a rejected lover, and we are left to our own devices, to be led into a number of boring subplots concerning Foster's personal problems and the detective who is in charge of the case's marriage problems, which are tedious and do nothing to explain the inexplicable. Barbara Hershey gives a tolerable performance as Foster's estranged wife and there is a denouement of sorts which acknowledges that as we all know, the man doing these things is not in his right mind, so he therefore commits suicide, leaving behind a cute little daughter who will no longer have to worry about having a nut for a father.Schumacher lays on a lot of pointless melodramatics to supposedly reassure us that because we are watching a nut we therefore have nothing to worry about. Reasonable people don't get this upset or only attempt to take steps to take control of their lives in a law abiding fashion ( in spite of the exact government indifference to their plight which this film is purporting to illustrate.) It's in this way, practically everyone has a right to feel offended by this film. The real life problems of the mentally ill are mocked and trivialised, and the well adjusted amongst us are lectured by a lurking reactionary subtext to take what the system dishes out to us. In other words, only the mentally ill would be interested in changing a system that according to this film ultimately works, ""Falling Down"" leaves a very bitter aftertaste because it is so intellectually dishonest. Its methods are underhand and exhibit the Hollywood studio way of fleecing the punters with sense enough to know they are, in actual fact, being robbed by a system that uses them up, then spits them out, and then have to swallow the logical surmise that the people who made this film really don't give a damn about it.'Falling Down' is a nasty piece of work, cynical in its purpose, totally specious in its overview of ordinary people and their struggles, and also demeaning to those who know what it's like to experience mental health issues because of outside circumstances they are powerless to control. It's not recommended; it is bad and hopelessly conceived on all possible levels, be it art, social commentary or entertainment. As an afterthought entertainment is something it sorely lacks, considering 'Falling Down's' overly anxious and ultimately unsuccessful attempts to have itself taken so seriously.",Falling Down

172,cwbellor,Angry White Male seeks affordable soda.,8,19 April 2013,"Life can be tough if you're a white, middle-aged ticking time bomb. It can be even tougher if you're a corporate drone who can't afford a soda, a phone call or even sleeves. And when your AC is broke and Garfield smiles at you, you can't find any comfort in how similar your life at that moment might be to the R.E.M. video for Everybody Hurts. Michael Douglass is one worker ant that isn't going to take road construction and grumpy golfers sitting down. He simply has to escape the stench of mediocrity that is the proverbial traffic jam and go on a quest for a less aggravating life. Why he can't find that in the middle of Los Angeles is anyone's guess. But Falling Down isn't simply a film about the angry white man or about your rights as a consumer. For the most part, Falling Down is a cautionary tale for stubborn fast food chains who refuse to serve breakfast after 11am. It's also a warning to sweaty convenience store owners who charge too much for soda, gun store nuts with dreams of domination and loco gangsteritos who don't tolerate loitering in the hood. Meanwhile, Rob Duvall is having a great day. He's in the same traffic jam but he's admiring the vandalism on a giant woman's breasts.

174,srobi280,Michael Douglas is having a very bad day.,10,11 April 2006,"Falling down is a movie that makes people take a look inside themselves. Have you ever felt so angry you want to explode? Have you ever had a week, or even a single day when nothing is going your way and everything seems to be going wrong? Who hasn't? On these days, you just want to throw your hands in the air and say ""I give up!"" Many people hold in their anger for days, weeks, months, or even years. They get up in the morning, go to work, come home, go to sleep, and do it all over again. There is no release of stress. People keep holding in this anger and tension, and it just builds, and builds, and keeps building, until it can build no more. This is the point where people lose it. This is the point where people commit suicide. This is the point where people go on shooting sprees. This is the point where people commit horrible crimes of passion, or just simply disappear and start a new life.Falling down is a movie about one such individual. The movie starts out with William Foster (Michael Douglas) sitting in a hot car in a traffic jam. You can feel the tension building up inside of him, until he finally gets out of the car and leaves it there. That moment when he gets out of his car is the moment he threw his hands in the air and said ""I give up!"" He wants to ""go home"". We find out more and more about him as the movie progresses. We find out he has been fired from his job over a month ago, his wife left him and took their daughter, and he has pretty much lost it all. We don't know too much about him, which is a good thing, as this leaves room for us to fill in the blanks with our own imagination, and think ""whatever this guy has been through, it must not have been easy"" and ""this could be me."" He goes through the city in a very matter-of-fact manner, trying to get home to his ex-wife, while people keep ""getting in his way"". He has been taking people's crap all his life, and he is not going to take it anymore. William Foster is basically your average Joe. William Foster could represent anyone. You feel for this guy. You feel his frustration. You feel his anger. You see yourself in his character. You see how just one man who loses it causes a ripple effect and influences his environment.Throughout the movie, through all the things that happened, you ask yourself, did he really do anything wrong? He was quirky, he was brutally honest, he was aggressive. But was it justified? It actually makes sense! He really didn't do anything wrong. Afterall, he could have just went on a shooting spree and turned the gun on himself. The whole thing is a last ditch effort to get his life back together. When Duvall catches up with him, he realizes that this is in no way possible, so he essentially commits suicide by pulling a water pistol on Duvall and getting shot. Go see the movie. Then see it again, think about it, and absorb what you just saw. And most importantly, learn to shed yourself of stress, or you just might be the next William Foster!",Falling Down
175,pesaresigiovanni,Classic,9,27 March 2020,"""Falling Down"" is a memorable portrait of urban society, an absolute masterpiece. Joel Schumacher's work is an important sociological and anthropological document, an heartbreaking story, and mostly a damn funny movie.",Falling Down
176,canadude,welcome to the urban jungle,10,24 April 2004,"Joel Schumacher, who has directed some (let us say) below average movies, every once in a while comes out with a film like ""Falling Down."" While I believe this happens all too rarely, ""Tigerland"" being his last phenomenal venture, his good films are really good.And ""Falling Down"" achieves near-perfection in its dive into the urban nightmare that was (and perhaps still is) America, specifically L.A. It's about a man who, in a scene that harks back to the opening scene of Fellini's 8 1/2, exits the fiery hell of his automobile, grabs his briefcase and enters the streets. But this is not another story of a yuppie being destroyed by a world he doesn't understand.D-Fens, or Bill Forster knows the urban nightmare. He lives it. And when he goes to a showdown with it, he's horrifyingly well-prepared. Through his eyes and his encounters we witness the contradictions, hypocrisies and lies of the world through which he wades. His odyssey is aggressive, but also full of despair - the growing knowledge that he is not going to achieve anything though it, he will simply fall down. But the fall reveals, like most plights into madness, the truths imperceptible to those who operate like good little boys and girls obeying the rules put down for them. After all, ""Falling Down,"" is a about the death of the American dream, a subject all too often explored, but rarely with such grace, humor, and insight.It also has one hell of a performance by Michael Douglas. He captures the middle-class, white-collar fragility and eventual collapse flawlessly. D-Fens has many shades to him; he's part insane, part over-educated, part under-skilled, but he is also lost and in pain. When he challenges the system he's letting off steam and sprouting words of bitter truth, but eventually he surfs into the darkness of his own psyche and reveals a lost and vulnerable man. This is crucial to ""Falling Down,"" because it is not simply a vigilante story. It's a story of a man who simply cracks under pressure and Michael Douglas does a phenomenal job of portraying him.It also has one hell of a performance by Robert Duvall. I remember Duvall as the half-insane surfing-obsessed captain in ""Apocalypse Now,"" but this is exactly the opposite. Duvall plays a detective who serves as a perfect counterpoint to D-Fens. He sees what D-Fens sees, but instead is quieted by it. He possesses a certain wisdom acquired through age and tragedy. Duvall is frail on the outside, but has surprising strength on the inside - Douglas' character is precisely the opposite. The difference between the two characters is what makes the climax so anti-climactic, yet concurrently so satisfying. It's a showdown of quiet understanding and damning inevitability.But it is also of hope, in some strange way. Because Duvall's detective understands D-Fens profoundly - and vicariously so do we. He represents the sign of hope amidst the world we have just witnessed, because he doesn't quit. ""Falling Down,"" thus, is about a deadly descent and little falls from which we can recover. It doesn't seek to manipulate, but to reveal. It's dark as hell, but so is it's topic - there ought to be more films like it.",Falling Down

It also has a good script. It has good performances by Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall. The story is good because it follows the investigation of Robert Duvall trying to find out what happened to this grocery store and three gangsters getting killed, I will not tell you how, but is connected to Michael Douglas.

For example, the prices in corner shops, digging up the road for no reason just to add a bit more money onto your paycheck.

Along the way, he encounters a number of colorful characters who symbolize personal frustration, impede his desire to ""go home"" and ultimately come into his line of fire. Trailing him is humane, veteran cop Prendergast (Robert Duvall) on his last day before retirement determined to bring him in and prevent further bloodshed and destruction.Michael Douglas does a masterful job of conveying the frustration of the disenfranchised. Having lost his job and unable to share liberal visitation with his young daughter, he is a study in both rage and frustration. Despite his violent actions and his unbalanced state, we feel for Douglas' character because some of those he comes up against (the gang members, army surplus store owner) are even more vile than he is. We also identify with the annoyances of traffic jams, overpriced items, self-important country club types and fast food fiascos. He is in many respects the little guy up against an unfair and an uncaring world, undercut by a system that chews people up and spits them out. Jobless, unable to remain close to those he cares for and unable to adjust to life's curve-balls, he becomes unhinged. Douglas' character (D-FENS) is one we can strongly sympathize with in principle- even if we disagree with his actions.Marring the film is the subplot involving the relationship between Robert Duvall and his unbalanced wife (Tuesday Weld)- a scenario that adds nothing to the film. It is there apparently to show us the humanity in Duvall's character, but it is merely annoying. Also unsatisfying is the dynamic between him and his Captain, a hard-ass type who dislikes Duvall, but whose character is never fully developed.Notwithstanding these criticisms, ""Falling Down"" is well worth two hours of your time and a worthy vehicle for Douglas.",Falling Down

186,medic249a2,An ordinary man at war with the everyday world....,8,17 July 2006,"'Falling Down' chronicles the misadventures of William Foster (Douglas), a.k.a. D-FENS, a defense engineer who was downsized with the end of the Cold War. Stuck in traffic on a Los Angeles freeway due to road work, D-FENS angrily gets out of his car and says 'I'm going home' when another motorist protests. On his way to his ex-wife's home in Venice, he runs into several problems, starting with an obnoxious clerk in a small market who refuses to give change, then charges an excessive price for a can of Coke. D-FENS reacts angrily, smashing the store to pieces with a baseball bat he takes after overpowering the clerk. He then continues on his trek but is harassed by two gang-bangers who cite him for 'trespassing' and 'loitering'. When these would-be toughs try to take his briefcase, D-FENS fights back, hitting the gang members with the bat and driving them off. Sgt. Pendergast (Duvall) is following D-FENS's progress after the store clerk is brought to him under the mistaken pretext that it is another robbery. Pendergast is about to retire and move to Arizona, but when he finds out about D-FENS he is determined to stop him. D-FENS subsequently runs into a homeless man who tries to trick him into giving him money, but D-FENS hands over his briefcase which has nothing except food in it, and walks away in annoyance. Soon after, the gang-bangers who D-FENS had driven off earlier come looking for him, and find him at a phone booth. They make a drive-by shooting trying to kill him, but miss and their car crashes. One gang member is killed outright; the second find D-FENS standing over him, an Uzi in hand, threatening him. As the gang member begs for his life, D-FENS shoots him in the leg & walks away, picking up the bag full of guns as he does. Pendergast soon finds out about it when a gang member's girlfriend is brought in for questioning about the drive-by. Meanwhile, D-FENS enters a fast-food restaurant, only to find out he cannot order breakfast as it is after 11:30. He pulls out a submachine gun and sprays the roof with bullets, then decides to order. Yet he is again annoyed when the product he gets is incredibly small compared to the ad photo. However he walks out of the restaurant & carries on, where he sees a man on a street corner protesting outside a bank about being 'not economically viable'. D-FENS sees the man arrested by police, and as the man is driven away, he says to D-FENS 'Don't forget me'. D-FENS nods, as if he feels a connection, which he likely does. Carrying on to a surplus store, he finds out the owner is a neo-Nazi, who threatens D-FENS with arrest after D-FENS disagrees with him. D-FENS tricks the man and overpowers him, killing him with one of the guns from the bag, then leaving with a rocket launcher the man had shown him. After he tries to call his wife, a rude man at a phone booth berates him for taking too long. Angrily, D-FENS pulls the Uzi from his bag and sprays the phone booth with bullets. Pendergast, meanwhile, realizes that these incidents are connected and is determined to hunt down D-FENS. On a freeway, D-FENS discovers more obnoxious road workers and takes out their equipment with the rocket launcher. Soon, he reaches a golf course, where an unpleasant old golfer tries to run him off the course by hitting a golf ball at D-FENS. D-FENS angrily pulls a sawed-off shotgun from the bag, and the rude old man grabs his chest. After D-FENS sends their golf cart rolling into a water trap, D-FENS stands over the old man & taunts him, as his heart pills are on the cart that has rolled into the water. Venice police, meanwhile, have responded to his ex-wife's calls about D-FENS's threats, and Pendergast & his partner, Det. Sandra Torres (Ticotin) head for her home. But D-FENS is on his way there as well, and a dramatic showdown between D-FENS & Pendergast will ensue...This movie has some fine performances from Douglas & Duvall, but even more than that, in D-FENS, it gives us a character that many of us can sort of empathize with. Douglas's character is one who has felt the frustrations & setbacks of so many things that people in the 90's dealt with; corporate 'downsizing' or 'right-sizing'; crime; the excesses of near-absolute free enterprise; divorce & marital issues. Many of us think criminal thoughts; we just don't act criminal acts, as D-FENS does. Undoubtedly so many of us have imagined ourselves as a D-FENS kind of person.8/10",Falling Down

His pathetic life becomes superimposed on other people's pathetic little lives, any of which probably strike too close to home for many viewers. You may identify with at least one of the characters way too much to be comfortable for you. Robert Duvall does some of his best work as Detective Prendergast who has to deal with his burden of boorish co-workers and shrewish wife (played very well by Tuesday Weld). Rachel Ticotin is Prendergast's partner, Detective Sandra (that's it, no last name), who is the kind of co-worker we all wish we could have. (An aside here, Ticotin is one of those actors who doesn't come to mind when you think of the great ones, but look at her work. It is always good, maybe so good that she becomes lost in the character instead of maintaining her own identity. Isn't that the mark of a great actor?)

Dealing with development people -- I have, and they're idiots -- what shocks me is that someone understood this film enough to let it fly, during what we might look back at as the height of political correctness. (I'm a comic, so trust me when I say things have eased up again in terms of what you can and can't get away with.) This film took b*lls to make. I'm surprised no one insisted that D-Fens should have a chemical imbalance that forced him to act this way. Whatever ""Hollywood"" stuff creeps into the film is there by necessity, and even then I think it's minimal.-- That it's racist. People, do you actually think the folks who made it didn't know that? Like it didn't occur to anyone that the guy is white and most of his targets aren't? It's part of what the film was trying to say, and if you missed that, too bad. What we're left with is a movie that tempts you to actually sympathize with the protagonist. And the worst part is, you might, to some extent. I saw this with a normally reasonable friend who said, ""I feel bad for this guy."" And I said, ""So does he. That's what started this mess."" D-Fens only sees his own situation and no one else's.I don't think this movie gets enough credit. To have the main character take such negative, life-altering action, and yet to be ambiguous enough that it lets you draw your own conclusions, well, I think that's gutsy. How often does a film portray things so wrong and leave open a window so people might find them right? You ain't gonna get a flick like this every year, so appreciate it. I think the guy is big-time sick, but maybe others don't. And that, in case you missed it, was the point.",Falling Down
194,chrisow,D - Fens gets his own back.,8,1 June 2002,"This film deals with the idea: ''What if you couldn't take any of society's c**p any more?''The opening shot of the film: William (D-Fens) Foster sitting in his car in a traffic jam, is claustrophobia inducing. The pace of the cutting from car to car shows his increasing bewilderment, and he just snaps.Robert Duvall's ''Last Day on Job'' police officer is a fascinating contrast to Foster. Here is a man who recognises society's problems, but he is able to live with it and not explode into acts of violence. Both Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall give spectacular performances. Joel Schumacher proves that he is one of America's most vital filmmakers (yes, I know about Batman and Robin)In some ways, this film is similar to Schumacher's 1999 masterpiece, 8MM. The themes are the same, even Foster can be compared to Cage's character, Tom Wells.I give Falling Down 8 out of 10. I had to take away 2 marks forthe fact that some of the humour did not fit into the film.the absurd scene where Foster is shown how to fire a rocket launcher by a kid!!However, a film that is worth watching and comes highly recommended.",Falling Down

I guess I just identified with the fact that sometimes we just want to shout and scream at irritating people! The difference between us and Michael Douglas' character is that we can control ourselves and he couldn't. There are some excellent scenes, like the one in the Fast-Food place and the one with the Gangsters. Michael Douglas' performance is excellent. The end is good and is well written.",Falling Down

No one died, but her supervisor was shot at and nearly killed before the gunman took his life. Disgruntled employee, cut-backs, who knows? I googled this phenomena and thousands of cases came up. This stuff happens every day -- sometimes from seemingly normal people with benign pasts. Not always able to profile these people, folks! While for the majority it is a slow and brooding build, there are a lot that up and decide they've had enough...This movie highlights this phenomena, sequencing in almost perfect pitch, the decline of the human psyche in a rapid period of time. If this stuff did not happen, there wouldn't be fist fights in traffic, which I have witnessed on occasion. This is what makes this movie such an instant classic, aside from the awesome direction: There are no other movies quite like it, oddly enough.Joel always chooses unique material.Pros: Acting, pacing, sequencing (not the same as pacing), vision (see: director), universal story-line, interesting subject matter, film captures the tension in a bottle.Cons: You end up rooting (at least I did) for the guy where you probably shouldn't.

203,golem3,Falling Down from Destitution,9,14 April 2006,"This is a movie about a man's fall into his own life, a life of living hell. It's a story about a fall into militarism due to bad society. Falling Down is an absolute classic for the underrepresented genre that exists all on its own, with only it to represent it: 'bleak present' sums it up.The story is done eloquently, from the beginning scene of high tension from daily routine to the maddening rush of road rage. There are characters throughout the film that are built upon fear. The director has deftly carved out such people such as the ultra-racist, the lonesome old hag, and the need for defense in the simple lives of Americans.Once in a while a film such as this arrives in Hollywood, with a major star in our case, Douglas, in its title role. It brings up the problems that plague our daily lives, the rut of its cyclic nature, and the need to get away from it all, the latter of which is expounded by Duvall. The overall film is shot like a simple action film, but it takes a wider eye to pick out that it is not your average Bruce Willis film here.There are some chintzy dialogue issues, as with all films, but mostly we are sympathetic to the cause of the protagonist  a man who has nearly completely reversed his role in life, from defender to offender, and had no choice in this downfall. Is it possible to be good and evil at once? It seems that our main character has become so unaffected by his own wrongdoing to see that he has lost his sight, and it makes him all the dramatic and attractive.If it were so simple that he was falling indefinitely into villainy, we might not be as thoughtful and attentive, but he has a deep social calling. There are some amazing points that our hero brings out in his adventure. ""What are golf courses,"" Douglas asks at one point, about this waste of space, in the height of his transition into his end.Of course, there is the aspect of sacrifice. We all have to surrender something in order to gain something  but at what cost? When does 'economically inviable' turn into a breach of our own values and lives? Falling Down seeks to answer such questions, if not with extremity, then with grace and ethereal sadness.RATING: 9.5 /10 ""I've passed the point of no return. You when that is? That's point in the journey when its longer to go back to the beginning then it is to continue to the end.""",Falling Down

206,hewilson2-72-796868,Average Middle Class Working Man Becomes the Bad Guy?,5,20 May 2021,"I just watched this movie here in May of 2021 for the first time. I didn't watch it sooner due to all the bad press it received initially back in 1993. The media - and not just the film reviewers but rather the entire news media - picked up the story and in the zeitgeist of the day, portrayed it as the story of an alienated, disaffected racist, sexist, homophobic white man who suddenly loses it and goes on a killing spree. It was presented at a problematic portrayal of modern American middle class life.Covid lock down - soon over here in California we hope - has me having burned through every other available movie over the past year so I finally broke down and watched it.In reality, there is a brief appearance by a racist, sexist, homophobic white character who is not the main character and does not represent the beliefs of the main character yet that is what the reviewers chose to focus upon.The reality is that the movie is about a guy with anger management issues. So much so that his ex-wife has a restraining order on him already. Yeah, he snaps. But given his background, it is not a surprise and his breakdown has nothing to do with race, gender or orientation. It is more of dystopian portrayal of an angry man gone bad in an inner city environment than it is an examination of modern middle class America.This movie's greatest value is as a a study of the role of media - news media and film media - in the shaping and guiding of American culture.",Falling Down

I don't fully believe in the law of attraction, but some of it does make sense in life.Falling Down is a movie that is telling its viewers that everything is not ""cool"",
this film does not really have a happy ending.
It's a motion picture depicting normal everyday people.",Falling Down
209,actionpro,Exploitative 90s Trash,5,7 August 2003,"The only thing saving this movie was Robert Duvall's honest portrayal of a man who had his life invested in his work.  Michael Douglas's acting was excellent, as it normally is, but his character was hard to sympathize with. He felt he was some sort of patron saint of the common, hard-working person, but it seems like he was just trying to make their lives much harder.  Hard-working construction workers?  Blow them up.  Hard-working country club care-takers?  Scare the hell out of them.  Fast-food slaves? Make them wet their pants.  Ex-wife and child? Ruin the day for them. Immigrant entrepreneur?  Take him out of business.  And why did the 'homeless' guy want to know what was in his briefcase?  What was his obsession?  All I have in my briefcase is a couple of pens, a pencil or two, a legal pad, a calculator, and maybe some files from work.  Nothing really valuable.  I feel that was a stupid scene and perhaps should have ended up stuck to the bottom of the editor's shoe.  All of the things described above were in the original trailers for this film, and they basically describe the spirit of the movie.  The ending is particularly stupid as well. 5/10",Falling Down

211,jackhamel1987,Society's breakdown,8,13 February 2014,"Michael Douglas is of course best known for Wall Street, and that was a brilliant, iconic performance. But, I would say that his role in this film easily equals it, if not betters it in its own way given that Douglas has to take on a character of a type of man who isn't always acknowledged - a man with mental health issues who slips into a breakdown and goes to war with society. That role is hard to take on, and hard to make successful, because although people want to root for the underdog, as we find out, Douglas is no underdog in this film. Falling Down starts at the beginning of 'D-FENS' (Douglas' character of no name), in a traffic jam, stressed, on the verge of a breakdown. Finally, his mind cracks and he simply says 'I'm going home'. This starts his warped, violent journey across various neighbourhoods in Los Angeles, from gangland to construction sites, to the rich areas and finally the coast where his journey comes to an end. In between his mindset continues to become darker and darker and the violence he uses to get what he wants becomes stronger and stronger. He starts with a and ends with a gun. It appears,at first, that he is the voice of the average man, someone who is being treated badly by his employer, his ex wife, and society in general. And, at first, perhaps we fall for it. But, it soon becomes apparent that 'D-Fens' isn't just an average men, he's part of the same problem, the same sick society that has caused him to snap. He's no longer the underdog, he's a menace and a danger to those he is supposed to care for, and it can only end one way. I suppose this is almost a warped, darker version of Clint Eastwood/Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars, set in the present. Douglas is the only American actor who could pull something like this off. He takes a character that is by nature terribly ill, terribly sick, and so thoroughly unlikable and somehow makes us root for him at the right moments, feel for him at the right moment, want him to win at the right moment,yet turn against him when we realise who he really is. No other American actor could have done that - they are by nature too positive! In fairness, it's not just about Douglas, even though he does drive this film. Robert Duvall does provide some strong support with a character that is clichéd. He takes the role of the retiring cop and lifts it above the level that it really is. And various other actors and actresses including Raymond J Barry, Rachel Ticotin and Barbara Hershey lift their roles to another level. One of the flaws of this film is that the supporting roles are perhaps too clichéd at times, and could have down with more thought. Having said that, if more time had been spent on those characters, we'd never have seen Douglas literally tear up the screen. Another weakness is that at times the scenes and violence are almost cartoonish and over the top. But, again this is the films way of taking a very dark story and making it watchable and even enjoyable at times. This would have been a very hard film, and a very dark story had it not been for the almost dark humour that appears at times. Not perfect by any means, but this is the film for the average man who feels like the underdog. It also does have a bigger message than most Hollywood films do, which is always refreshing. 8/10.",Falling Down
212,Tralequang,"A movie to criticise certain points of view and realities, yet justify them at the same time",9,17 February 2020,"I came for the ""good guy turns violent"", and was not disappointed at how the plot progresses and the message is delivered.The central story is on D-Fens, a middle class white man who has recently been divorced and fired. The action revolves around his journey back to his ex-wife's home to attend his daughter's birthday. He has a temper control problem, which, in combination with his distorted view towards certain matters of society and certain problem of its own, has trigger a rage in him. This explained for his several over-the-top reactions towards his journey incidents, from minimal to criminal.For the plot's convenience, D-Fens is only caught at the end in a usual dramatic fight between the villain and the police. This has been made possible by the inclusion of the subplot, mister Prendergast the policeman and his problematic marriage life, as well as the bureaucratic police force.Plot wise, the movie is quite simple, for its focus and selling points lies in the perspectives of D-Fens facing his incidents. They reveal all about him, an angry middle class white failure with built up hatred towards the upper class, commercialism, bureaucracy and immigrants. He feels frustrated, like he has been treated unfairly despite all of his effort and capability, which he thinks the aforementioned forces are to blame. As he let offs steam through violence, he believes his actions are justified, for he is just a good guy ""walking home to his family"". Anger and distorted perspectives make quite a psychopath out of a working man.",Falling Down

214,votesmall,Tragic depiction of the deterioration of a human psyche,10,13 April 2013,"I first heard about ""Falling Down"" from a video about guns in movies. The reviewer said that the film not only vilified guns, but also said that there was no way to stop this kind of guns on the streets. We didn't get the chance to rent it that week so I checked out a few scenes online and was so impressed by the few scenes that I saw that I went right out and bought it. Now, you may be thinking that was a foolish decision on my part. I was worried that I may have bought a movie with a few good scenes and two hours of fluff, but it was a chance I was willing to take. The decision, despite it being impulsive, was one of the best movie purchases I have ever made.""Falling Down"" is about a typical man named Bill Foster, who is played by Michael Douglas. Now, I will admit that when I first saw that Michael Douglas was the lead, it sort of turned me away a little bit. I'd seen earlier films of his, and it seems like he always plays the same character. Some rugged tough guy struggling with issues and what-not. I thought that way until I saw Falling Down. His performance completely blew me away. I was not expecting such a subtle, yet tortured character, much less such an obviously screwed-up one.Foster just got laid off from his job at the defense department who is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the day of one of the hottest days in Los Angeles. His stress doubles so much that the simple noises of bratty children fighting or people honking their horns in frustration become magnified to an almost unbearable level. He instantly gets out of his car and walks away, abandoning it. At this point, you may be able to tell that Foster isn't exactly a person who is mentally well. But who could blame him? Foster starts walking to get to his daughter's birthday party, which is across town in Venice, and as the minor annoyances we all face become unbearable, he decides that he won't put up with it anymore and goes on a rampage through the streets of Los Angeles. It's almost as if it's a game of Grand Theft Auto. One thing leads to another, and he's walking down Hollywood with a gym bag full of guns. I suppose you can see where things are going from here. What follows is a disturbing, yet somehow strangely hilarious series of events where Foster starts a one-man war on the system that shunned him. There's also a detective that won't quit pursuing him, but this is difficult because Foster is always one step ahead of him. Sure, he may be going berserk, but it is in an understandable way. Foster isn't really hurting anybody, he's just lashing out at the society that he once loved, and the society that loved him back. Foster is a relic of another time, a time when people had respect for each other. He doesn't like what he's doing; he almost feels that he has to. He's confused and he just wants to try and make people understand what's wrong with society so things can get better. The ending is very suspenseful and one of the most beautiful and tragic endings I have ever seen.The cast was incredible. Not only do we receive a spellbinding performance from Michael Douglas, but we also get a lovable performance from Robert Duvall as a soon-to-be-retired detective. I was surprised at Duvall's performance as well. I haven't ever seen Duvall in such a role before. Duvall knows that the city is a terrible place, but he isn't trying to make it perfect. He's trying to do whatever he can to make it better. Barbara Hershey also does an excellent job as the ex-wife of Foster, who is afraid of him. What makes this even more tragic is that Foster doesn't know why she is afraid of him, and even thinks that they are still married. The only thing I would have changed with the cast is perhaps giving Foster more screen time, and dropping the subplot about Duvall's marriage.This may be the only comedy-drama besides Dog Day Afternoon that not only compels you with its intriguing and disturbing storyline, but it makes both the comedy and the realism work.An interesting scene involves a man who is ""Not Economically Viable"" protesting outside of the bank that denied him a loan. As everyone else on the street ignores him, Foster pays attention to him. Foster obviously sympathizes with this man who is also being stepped on by society. As the man is escorted away in the police car he looks directly at Foster and says ""don't forget me"". In a gesture of empathy, he acknowledges this. When they look at each other, it is as though they are looking into a mirror and seeing the same thing: a victim of society. Another scene I always thought was really sad was where Foster remarked that a plastic surgeon has a better house than him, who keeps the country safe. That really tugged at my heartstrings, because it's true. The most important and hardworking people in this country get absolutely nothing in return from the country they spend their lives serving.Overall, this is a very original and sad film. Not depressing, tragic. Even though Foster is supposed to be the villain, you identify with what he's feeling and you start to, oddly enough, sympathize with the man. ""Falling Down"" isn't a revenge movie. Nobody is supposed to cheer. It's meant to be both tragic and amusing with its shatteringly violent path of destruction that Foster is carving into the city. It really shows what this man is going through and makes you feel for him. That's quite an achievement.",Falling Down
215,RoseNylan,"Fantastic film, one of the best of 1993",10,1 March 2010,"The early 1990's were a period of intense anger and frustration in America. The recession of 1990 and 1991 and the defense cutbacks that occurred around the same time cost many in the defense industry their jobs and contributed to a rise in crime and poverty. Michael Douglas plays a character directly affected by this situation.You can clearly identify with this character. He is simply frustrated and cannot take any more of it. It almost verges on being comical how soon the character goes over the edge. There is one seen where he pulls out a machine gun in a fast food restaurant because they stopped serving breakfast at 10:30 rather than 11:00 as he thought.At times, you actually root for this character as he fights off gangsters and neo-Nazi's.This is a must see film and probably Michael Douglas' best performance to date.",Falling Down

Michael Douglas did an amazing job playing the exasperated Bill Forester, who goes from being a loving husband and father with a great job to a maniac who stands up for his rights as a consumer and as an American citizen. He lashes on all forms of evil,from the Hispanic gang members who threatened him to the neo-Nazi skinhead who had his judgement day coming. This movie had rooting so much for Bill Forester as he was never a bad guy, just more of a man who had pushed to far( losing his job, being separated from his daughter and his dog, being ripped by the merchants and big businesses in America, etc.) I really thought the film got sad towards the end as Bill Forester became a voice for the little guy, and when he died, it was just heartbreak as the little guy lost their voice of reason and the mascot for their fight.",Falling Down

218,jacco59,wow...every working man's fantasy carried out,9,16 September 2011,"What a film! 9 is a really high rating for me, seriously, but this film deserves it. Every working man has had moments like this: when they're just sick of it all and they fell like shooting up something, someone, anything really, just to release their anger. Well, this man (played beautifully by M. Douglas) takes that to the next level. He's in his car in a still-standing line at a roadworks site. Suddenly he gets out of the car, and when a police officer yells at him what he thinks he's doing, he says simply 'I'm going home.'And he blasts the things that stand his way out of it with, of course, guns. You see, this is no office worker. This is a man who works secret projects for the U.S. army, so he has access to lots and lots of guns. Every time he sees something that angers him he begins to yell about how society has broken down, Meanwhile the police, lead by detective prendergast on his final workday before retirement, try to track him as he leaves a trail of murders and shooting-ups behind in the city. He is doing all that to get to his ex-wife and children. His ex-wife divorced him because one day he went crazy and beat her up, and so he was given police orders to stay at a distance of at least 100ft from her st all times. Prendergast really understands what this man is doing and why he's doing it. All this leads to an epic showdown at a pier, where he is ultimately shot by Prendergast, which is the end of the film.Conclusion: Rent this movie and watch it. You will not be disappointed, Pinky-swear.",Falling Down
219,aliceboy,Not as bad as expected,6,22 June 2006,"As far as I'm concerned, Joel Schumacher is the epitome of what people mean when they disparagingly call something 'too Hollywood': he likes his explosions HUGE, his emotions sappy and his characters paper-thin. So, with that in mind, I had low expectations of 'Falling Down,' but watched it anyway. (For a change, I wasn't watching it because of my wife, but because I've always been a little intrigued by the premise. It was only Schumacher that kept me from it before now.) It's not unreasonable to say the movie surpassed my expectations, but not my much. This is a hard film to get a grip on. Is it a comedy? Is it an action movie? Is it the story of a psycho on the loose? Is it a biting satire/commentary on society? Is it a racist diatribe? It seems 'Falling Down' is a little of all these, but it's often difficult to tell if this is intentional, or because writer Ebbe Roe Smith (an actor writing, rarely a good sign) lost the thread somewhere along the way. Again, it seems a little of both. For instance, there are clear indications of intentional parallels to be drawn between the D-FENS and Prendergast (the off-kilter women in their lives, 'London Bridge is Falling Down,' their general demeanours). However, with those same two characters, we see an unravelling of narrative parallels (D-FENS attacks the Korean shopkeep with open racial malice while Prendergast carelessly assumes the Korean and the Japanese cop speak the same language; D-FENS battles the Mexican gang guys, and Prendergast has to fight to weasel his way into his Mexican coworker's case) that seem intentional at first but may have just been coincidental. Then there's the view of D-FENS as a man on the verge of becoming (to borrow a term from 'Manhunter'), and the two directions we can see him going. Could he have been a quiet fighter for justice like Prendergast, or would his vigilantism have been a slippery slope to the homophobic/homoerotic leatherboy Nazi fantasy of 'Nick, The Nazi Surplus Store Owner'? (I won't even go into that whole twisted scene! Was that homoeroticism intentional? I REALLY hope so...I'd hate to think someone could come up with that without meaning to.) Beyond all this symbolic nonsense lies the movie itself, truly a Schumacher piece. The explosions are indeed huge, the emotions are certainly sappy, and the characters are so thin you can practically see through them. The script, though at times inventive and thought-provoking, contains some terrible dialogue and it is often painful to watch two heavy-hitters like Duvall and Douglas struggle with what's in their mouths. The cast beyond them is filled out with some of the stiffest actors I've ever seen supporting playing even flimsier characters than the leads (what was the deal with the super-obnoxious guy paired up with Prendergast's gal-pal?). So, what was this movie? It was (I hope) a dark comedy action antihero diatribe, but it was also a half-assed attempt at depicting America in a single human. That human, of course, is our main character William 'D-Fens' Foster. He's not just an average American, but the country itself. It's not necessarily apparent at first viewing, but it really all comes together when, just before he's shot to death (your spoiler, ladies and gents) Prendergast assures D-FENS he's 'the bad guy' (in almost exactly the same way other characters have evoked his disbelief when they expect the absolute worst from him). His response is, 'How did that happen? I did everything they told me to.' Therein lies the crux of the movie and the character: he is America, which has become the 'bad guy' to most of the world, in spite of (perhaps because of) doing everything it thought its own populace and the world stage wanted. But (as ably illustrated in the home movie when he's forcing the kid onto the rocking horse he was going to buy her AGAIN this year), it was always more about what he/it wanted: countries don't ask to be invaded and have their dictators toppled, but America's always been more than willing to do it for them...as long as there's something in it for America. All told, this wasn't a bad movie, just typically heavy-handed for Schumacher. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I'm glad it was a late-night flick I didn't have to pay for. The biggest success of the entire film, regrettably, is that it conveys that it was a hot day, a damn hot day.",Falling Down

223,apfortony,Don't make him angry,7,30 June 2002,"Falling Down is the kind of movie everyone can sort of identify with. When the speed limit is 55 mph and you are late for work, inevitably you always seem to get behind someone doing 30 and not afraid to use the break. When you are in the grocery store you don't mind getting out of other peoples way but then it seems like you are the only one providing that courtesy. In situations like these one gets perturbed. Because of this it is very easy to watch Falling Down and yell things at the screen like 'Yeah, Man!' and 'Nice one!' But we must avoid getting carried away with these feelings and remember the golden rule. Stress is a killer. The Douglas character doesn't understand why he is the bad guy despite the fact that many people he has encountered are the dead guys. When watching this movie you get a strange feeling. You are supposed to root for the guy but you're glad he's not anyone you know. This movie shows that as we go through our daily routine we are all subject to that one little instance that will trigger our aggression and send us on a downward spiral toward insanity.

224,bayhorse,"Screaming ""Fire"" In a House That Is Perhaps Actually Burning!",10,15 December 2006,"Why do I like Mr. Foster so much, and even empathize with him so completely?--Albeit Purely Hypothetically! Is it really just because I must be no less crazy than he, as most would readily insist? Or, could it possibly be something much less typically simple (non-) minded than that, which is more popularly, normatively, thus alone unassailably reflected in what has happened, what we've all allowed to occur, to every one of us, and insist upon keeping that way? Perhaps it's the form, and not the content, of how he'd begun expressing himself? Well, then, maybe he should have just found a friend to talk to, or even a stranger on the street; one who would, no doubt, have sarcastically called him crazy, regardless of how calmly and sensibly he'd tried to share his feelings! In fact, far-too-many, if not most, instinctively interpret kindness as weakness and stupidity! About the only form of somebody's need to falsely or at least ignorantly but sincerely believe himself at all Christianly Compassionate, rather than much more predictably and viciously resentful, which he'd thereby have had even a small chance of encountering; would have undoubtedly assumed the conventionally and evasively falsifying expression of a suggestion that he see a psychiatrist, where the presupposition that he's the only one with the problem remains axiomatically supreme. At best, the psychiatrist might uncharacteristically concede, if he's sufficiently ""one-upped,"" that, while society itself unwittingly suffers from its own pseudo-collective form of psychosis, there's nothing anybody can do to change that, thus leaving the only realistically sane alternative that of adjusting to it, while antiseptically neutralizing the very reason why society itself could and even should consider changing, one real individual at a time, if not all of them, at once! . . . His wife was certainly not available, just as the film itself at least appears to presuppose that no account as to how the brutally-insensitive hostility in her attitude had come about needs to be offered, since the answer to that is allegedly right before the horrified eyes of the audience, which smugly assumes the way he's expressing himself to be nothing but the cause, rather than perhaps at least as decisively an effect of the fact that no other form of approach had ever made any constructive difference. In fact, try saying ""please,"" to the Devil, and his technique will often be to get your goat, so he can be the one to point the finger! The only thing which never self-vindicatingly comes into focus is the kind of man who just wants to see his daughter, or the kind of man whose reasons for feeling so dangerously perturbed should have been no less self-evidently and understandably revealing. Perhaps he should have made a movie about the problem, although it would have thereby been reduced to nothing but a form of contained and squared-away entertainment, infested with mere actors (as well as Circus Maximus spectators), who've learned nothing, but only want to be, as Nietzsche so cynically and accurately observed, well-paid, and ""glorified,"" in full (Matthew 6:1-6). Or, what if he'd tried to share his thoughts on a web site such as this, about a similar kind of film; only to have received a long string of negative votes, and even complaints to the web site masters about how he's not sticking to an appropriately relevant or artistically non-controversial critique of the film; from many-too-many who are offended due to their unwillingness to handle any deeper, more meaningfully relevant kind of truth, and whose demands that the comments be deleted would thereafter be instantaneously honored? . . . I was going to say that such people are typically reflective of Hitler, in their spontaneously instinctive inclination to insist that anything they don't like be totally censored; particularly if their feeling is prevalent enough to where they know their demand would thereby alone be self-evidently vindicated, no questions asked, as well as very undemocratically minus any respect for perhaps even the many who would have appreciated a chance to read such comments. But, then, on second thought, perhaps even Hitler was also if not even primarily reacting, in spirit, to the very kind of people who would have unhesitatingly reacted, in precisely his way, to still others, who would have reacted, in exactly the same way, to them, had any one of them, from either category, simply had the chance Hitler did to do so, coupled with what Scarface called ""the guts to be what you want to be,"" which alone most so very ""virtuously,"" timidly, domesticatedly, albeit no less brutally, uncompromisingly, in attitude, lack. I have no doubt that most would want my head, or at least my comments bigotedly deleted, for what I'm about to say, in the more constructive way that they'd thus quite hypocritically suggested the Columbine boys should rather have expressed themselves! Nevertheless, what I do believe is that there is a great deal of truth to the assertion that Hitler had been at least as much a reaction to ""Hitler"" as anything else (he had himself called it ""Fighting Terror with Terror!""), and that this is at least as much the reason he's been so hatefully, hysterically demonized, from beneath all the indispensably good arguments against him behind which they conveniently hide from themselves! Even Bible Believers incoherently forget that, when Paul and Peter speak of all the powers that be having been Divinely-Ordained, Hitler must thereby have been meant, too, at least for the duration of his tenure, and for a much better reason than that he had simply ""come out of nowhere, "" to disrupt an otherwise ""Christianly Harmonious"" situation! The biggest waste of all is that nobody's learned, even from Hitler! However, the next and last one will prove to be much more ""antithetical"" or ""diplomatically palatable"" than he had been, particularly in his most equally, morally unjustifiable folly!",Falling Down

227,damienmuldoon,Why was this not a better movie?,7,24 May 2006,"I watched this movie for about the fourth time on T.V. a few nights ago, and tried desperately to understand why it wasn't a more important film. It is a spectacular study of the ""American Dream"" going horribly wrong. I'm quite sure Joel Schumacher was trying to make a serious social comment with this film. Somewhere along the line though, that comment gets lost. Any sympathy we might have for the D-FENS character is slowly stripped away until you actually want to see him killed by the end of the movie. I believe this was a mistake. Schumacher's social comment could have been more forcibly made had some good come from D-FENS'S campaign of righteous chaos. Most of the people he harms are pretty awful anyway.Michael Douglas plays the part of D-FENS superbly. One wonders why he hasn't taken on similar roles rather than the catalogue of aging womanizers he usually plays. Despite his flawless performance though, I kept wondering what Di Nero would have brought to the role.The other element that lets this movie down is Robert Duvall's stereotypical retiring cop. Duvall plays the role well. But that whole plot line introduces an element of cheesiness that is hopelessly out of place in what should have been a serious social drama. If you've not seen ""Falling Down"" then its well worth watching.

He's threatened by a Hispanic street gang, (briefly) taken prisoner by a neo-Nazi shopkeeper, and repeatedly annoyed beyond belief at what society has become.

However, what i really like about this film is that it looks at everyday life, sticks its middle finger up at it, then shoots whatever's in the way ,(the scene where Foster calmly fills a phonebox with lead after being hassled by a moron waiting to use it is memorable).

Anyway, in these small rituals of film, usually I'm disappointed because once the film from my childhood is now considered in a completely new look while remaining indifferent. But not this time. in the first shot I felt the uniqueness of this film. Attention to detail by the director and the tense scenes and a professional camera from the start, make this film an unforgettable experience for every true film fans.The main protagonist of the film is the famous Michael Douglas and very easily say that this is his best role as the same side and on the best directorial achievement Joel Schumaher. It really is hard to find some flaw in the film. By Michael Douglas is a man after a strenuous job to become very frustrated with his current relationship with the family, and from a reputable intellectual man turns into a serious threat to anyone he had disrupted the already bad day. However, Douglas in this film portrays not an evil man but a man who cares about his family, from which he was denied access to court. However, he does not hesitate, and his goal of leaving the victims in its path.This film is a critique of society, racism, nationalism, work, etc. incorrectness.

232,eagle_owl,Brilliantly tackles the problems of modern life.,9,19 April 2005,"Falling Down stars Michael Douglas as William Foster, a man at the end of his tether. He's a defence worker who, whilst sitting in a traffic jam, suddenly abandons his car. He is desperate to regain contact with his ex-wife, and decides that he must be re-united with her, but she is terrified of his mood swings, and wants to keep him away at all costs.As Foster makes a beeline for his wife, he meets a diverse array of people. He doesn't have enough money to pay a shop owner, and thinks his prices are too high, and so trashes his store. He strays into the territory of some urban youths and narrowly survives a drive-by shooting.These are essentially a series of self-contained sketches, each of which illustrates a different problem of modern life. Even though Foster behaves in a way that seems highly irrational you still sympathise with him, and it's questionable whether he is really any crazier than the society in which he lives.Foster's nemesis is Prendergast, a close-to-retirement cop played by Robert Duvall. As Foster causes mayhem wherever he goes, Prendergast starts to see a pattern, but he is hampered by many of his colleagues, who think he is just imagining things, and trying to delay his retirement as long as possible.The sections featuring Duvall are quite conventional. The cop nearing retirement is a well worn cliché, but here it's effective, as these scenes lend the film some variety, and complement Douglas's scenes rather than detracting from them. The two main protagonists are both sympathetic in their different ways and each is single minded in the pursuit of their objectives, but it's impossible for both to succeed.There is a surprising amount of comedy in the film, black though it is, generated by Foster's extreme reactions to seemingly innocuous events. Against all the odds the comedy succeeds, mainly thanks to Douglas, who turns in one of his best ever performances, as a man pushed too far by events beyond his control.Foster could be dismissed as a lone nut-case, but there can't be many who haven't contemplated acting as he does at one time or another. He sees himself as just an ordinary man trying to live a normal life, and is genuinely amazed when told he is considered a bad guy.Falling Down is a terrific film, which illustrates some of society's problems through the travails of its central character. It's amazingly effective at getting its point across, while retaining some ambiguity on the question of whether Foster is a hero or a villain. That's left for you to decide.",Falling Down

235,JJthebat,Fantastic,9,12 April 2020,"There was a lot of hype and expectations going into this film. Although funny enough, none of them were influenced by the film's initial controversy back in the 90's, in fact, i've never even heard of the said controversy until i saw the film just today. The only reason i've had known of this film was because of my father, being one his all time favourite films and also being a big fan of Michael Douglass. So he was very excited and enthusiastic to see this film with me and my family, as he usually is when we watch a film he really likes. But more importantly, he was very interested in hearing my what was my opinion on the film and what was it that i was trying to say. Which is i guess what i'm writing about right now.The direction of this movie is pretty fantastic. And it's all exemplified in the opening scene. The close ups to Douglass's dismayed face, the music building up higher and higher, the heat on the road making everybody uncomfortable. It sets the tone perfectly for the rest of the film. With great cinematography, intriguing writting, and of course, amaizing performances from almost everyone involved.Similar to a movie like Taxi Driver (which was also really controversial upon release), it depicts a lot of social and personal struggles in day to day life that many people around the world go through, all though maybe in a more exaggerated and almost comedic way. Perhaps this is why my father was legitimately interested in my takeaway, as these are things he relates with and he wants to know if I understand them as well. 2 characters go through similar existential struggles: the feeling of unfufillment and lack of importance in you're life, and the apparent indifference and mean spirited nature of the exterior world. However, one of them has already lost it and has decided to take vendetta against the world around him and it's injusticies, while the other still holds on and tries to live his life the best he can (try to tell which one is which). We watch ""Fenz"" do things that at some point of our lives we always wanted to do, being a badass while calling out the dumb bullcrap that annoys us all the time, but it also exposes those same desires as being ultimately pointless and dangerously violent. Most of us would never do these things, but at the very least we have thought of doing them, and the movie shows us that we are all the victims and we can easily become ""the bad guy"", just as we encounter people whom we think are ""the bad guys"". We have all been there, after all.In my father's own words, he believes that the message of the film is that "" you can never know who you're messing with"". While at first that may seem shallow, i don't think it's entirely wrong. In fact, i think he may have a point. You see, while ""D-FENZ"" is a complete lunatic, most of the people he encounters (key word being MOST"") just straight up provoke him and make matters worse. And these people truly don't know what has been going on with someone's day or even at what state in their lives they are. And being mean to them can set them off in ways you may not be prepared for. So like the film states by the end, just because you have struggles doesn't mean you can lash out to everyone else, you should try as much as you can to be empathetic and nice, as you can never truly know ""who you're messing with"".",Falling Down

They both have been gradually crushed by life. One a laid off, divorced man at the end of his rope, the other a disrespected, ashamed man who is about to retire. Gradually, they shed their former selves, as when Foster gives him his breifcase saying 'I won't be needing it anymore.There are so many symbols sprinkled throughout, from the fact that both men have the same the toy in their possession that plays the same tune-'London bridges falling down', it is hard to pick just one. But here is one. One is the scene where Bill Foster is pleading with his exwife when he is the intended target of a retaliatory driveby. They miss and wind up crashing the car. He calmly walks over and then stops. There behind is an Hispanic style portrait of Jesus with his arms outstretched. He then blocks the view so that he has replaced Jesus. This imagery is repeated again at the very end when he gets shot and falls with his arms similar into the ocean. Another is him telling his ex over the phone how an Apollo mission had gone past the point of no return, and had to finish their journey to the end, what Foster must do.The cop, Pendergast, is on the same journey, gradually getting sucked into the of man on the loose. During the process, he loses his timidity and begins to reclaim what the once had. Both men, the end of their respective journeys, meet at the end in a showdown. A great scene. But one of the more subtle ones standout just as much. A man has been coming the same bank for seven years, the same as Foster's employment before his lay off, and is refused a loan. He protests with a sign saying 'not economically viable'. He is wearing the same outfit as Foster to a tee, and as he is led away by police in handcuffs, he catches Foster's eye, and Foster gives a slight nod.

But, as the story starts to wind down, it becomes obvious that he is just another wacko who would not think twice about killing anyone who angers him. Robert Duvall does his usual great job as a cop who is working his last day before early retirement. But, it remains to be seen if he will really retire once he realizes that he will have to spend every day of the rest of his wife with his ugly, nagging wife. The ultimate connection between Duvall the cop and Douglas, the wanted man is one that defies credibility. But, all in all, the film is reasonable entertaining.

Unfortunately, Douglas has some anger problems...he seems to have a calm, cool temper until he whips out the weapons.

241,kennychaggerty,A Relatable yet flawed film,6,15 February 2010,"Have you ever had such a bad day that you could just lose your mind? We all have our boiling points, yet the boundaries of society normally prevent us from exploding at the simple injustices presented day by day. However, in the case of William Foster (Michael Douglass) from Joel Schumacher's Falling Down, he lashes out at every simple societal transgression after he loses his job, gets divorced from his wife, and is issued a restraining order so that he is not able to see his daughter. The violent acts performed by the frustrated Foster are what make Falling Down worth a rent. Every person has their pet peeves about how society functions and it is really interesting to watch a common citizen attack the fundamental norms of everyday life in America. For example, in one scene Foster goes to a fast food restaurant in order to eat breakfast only to discover that breakfast is no longer served because it is 11:35 a.m. and the restaurant quit serving at 11:30 (I've been there). Where most of us would just be disappointed and would order something off the lunch menu, Foster whips out a gun and begins shooting the place up. There are several scenes such as this that are really entertaining. Unfortunately the scenes where Foster is not thrashing out at people are where this film suffers. There are a lot of scenes that I felt were not needed. I love Robert Duvall but we've seen his retiring cop character many times in other films. In all honesty every time his character appeared on screen I simply wanted Schumacher to cut to a scene in which Foster was belaboring the citizens of L.A.

Predating Fight Club, the film has become a point of identity for men craving a return to traditional/conservative values.

247,beermonsteruk,Not Economically Viable!!,9,25 May 2020,"What a performance! I'd seen this film many moons ago and always remember Michael Douglas's stunning performance but needed to revisit this, it was even better than I'd remembered, not just Michaels stunning performance but the film itself.Michael Douglas stars as William ""D-Fens"" Foster, an everyday man recently divorced and fired from his job, is sitting in his car, frustrated, stuck in a massive, seemingly never ending traffic jam, and on a boiling hot day, to make matters worse, his air conditioning then fails, Foster at the end of his tether, simply abandons his car, stating he is ""going home"", this is the start of a very eventful and unforgettable day, and not just for Foster.As Foster enters a Korean owned convenience store, he is frustrated by the owner refusing change and poor use of English, charging 85cents for a Can of Cola is the final straw, and the start of Foster's rampage, after smashing up the store, he calmy pays the man 50cents for the Cola and leaves.Things don't end there as Foster is harassed and threatened by Gangs for simply invading their private property, Foster is not amused and again events take a turn for the worse as violence ensues.As the chain of events spiral out of control, Foster seems hell-bent on simply seeing his daughter on her birthday, but his ex wife has a restraining order on him, and wants him nowhere near her or their young child.As these events occur, a soon to be retired Police Officer Prendegrast, links them together and despite his colleagues initial disbelief, rightly insists all these occurrences are caused by one man.This films brilliance has many layers, and many themes explored, discrimination (the black man protesting outside the bank, that he is ""not economically viable"", this seems to strike a chord with Foster), poverty, the gap between rich and poor as well as mental health, Foster is clearly having a mental breakdown, we see certain scenes that his anger has been boiling over for some time, in those days the issue of struggling mental health was not widely as available or talked about, especially with men, Prendegrast, too has these issues as his own wife is struggling, one of the reasons he too is retiring and was on desk duty.As well as being very deep, the film is also extremely humorous at times, (Foster asking terrified customers of a burger joint if they are enjoying their meal after firing a machine gun particularly had me in stitches), and Douglas brought so much to the role, humour, frustration, anger, as well as lamenting his old family life, this is an Oscar winning performance from not only Douglas but the director Joel Schumacher, this is amongst his best in a very fine selection of work, this film is highly recommended, ignore the liberal haters, this film is a classic.

249,dinaia,Intelligent and Dynamic Story,9,6 August 2003,"Having watched the movie, I had this very defined and accurate sensation of how tough and strong normal people are, as to survive the constant aggression of the day-by-day life. If we were less than tough and strong we would end up shooting and beating people up like Michael Douglas' character in this movie. From the very start we realize it is something wrong with him, by the way he perceives the details, people's faces in the traffic jam, the heavy heat, or by the way he carries a conversation when he decides to leave the car in the middle of the road and go home on foot. There begins a journey with all the signs of a tragic end. Each new incident adds a little to his discomposure, and every time he refuses to ignore the absurdity of the situations, as a normal' person would do. But it's only a matter of time before he crosses the line and reaches the point of no return'. It is the point where someone loses their equilibrium, their sense of reason and stability and no one can help them. Society, in the form of local police reacts by trying to hunt him and stop him. Nothing left to do. The big events in Bill's life that formed his character already happened. We only witness one day in his life, the fatal day that was bound to happen, when everything goes wrong. The efficient filming and directing of the one-day story make possible the understanding of a lifetime. It seems to be one of the directors' strengths to choose a dense one-unit story (taking place one day like in `Falling Down' or in one particular spot like in `Phone Booth') and make something suspenseful and even meaningful out of it.",Falling Down

252,angrytexan,Deeper than you think,10,1 November 2000,"This film is absolutely incredible. I hate Joel Schumacher for desecrating the Batman franchise with ""Batman and Robin,"" but I am ever grateful for his direction of this milestone of a movie. Before you read the rest of this comment, I'd like you to look at the ""Maltin Review,"" the link for which is at the left of this page under the ""Plot and Quotes"" section (it's very short).I asked you to do this for two reasons. First of all, Mr. Maltin makes the observation that the movie is very well acted, and this is true.  Each character is portrayed so convincingly that the movie is almost disturbingly real.  I finally have a professional to substantiate one of my views....Secondly, the Maltin Review (ignorantly) poses an important question that I wish to explain.  The question is ""What's the point?""  More than anything else, this movie is a social commentary.  It states that morality is decaying.  Our values and ethics are gradually wasting away.  Each of Foster's (D-Fens) obstacles lacks some sort of decency or respect. Foster himself represents the American goodness that seems to be disappearing from our populace.So what does Douglas's character do when he is brought to confront these obstacles?  He acts accordingly.  The viewer should note that Douglas always gives these people what they deserve.  All of his aggressors-changed-victims get exactly what they had coming to them, and nothing more.  The store owner is set straight for running a consumer-unfriendly business, the gang members die for their own stupidity in trying to take another's life, even the Whammy Burger gets justice for not employing humanity and kindness in its restaurant.Towards the end, it begins to look as if Foster has gone over the edge. But he really hasn't.  He's simply dishing out the justice that the law prohibits. Foster is righteousness incarnate.  Although he crosses the boundary of legality, he never commits the immoral.  But one man can't get rid the world of its filth, and by the end of the film, we notice that the line between good and bad is severely blurred.  I can't reveal the end, nor do I want to, but the most significant line of the movie occurs within the last 3 minutes--watch it and you'll see exactly what I mean.Okay, I may as of yet failed to explain the point of the movie. Sorry. The point is that common decency is in a downward spiral, and there's nothing we can do to help it.  THE GOOD AND THE DECENT ARE OPPRESSED BY THE WICKED (not to sound too biblical).  Maybe it's just bad parenting or something, but too many people fail to be compassionate toward their fellow human beings. Take, take, take--Ask not what your fellow man can do for you, but what you can do for your fellow man, for God's sake.As for the title of this comment, here's something for those of you who have seen the movie. (DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!!)-The main scenes of the movie are practically foreshadowed with the bumper stickers in the traffic jam.-The scene in the back of the army surplus store is the turning point. (""I can't. I'll fall down."")  No kidding.  When Foster's glasses crack so does he.  Its the first and only time he voluntarily kills someone.-The ""not economically viable"" man is wearing the same outfit as Douglas, tie and all, hinting at the obvious--that Douglas isn't (socially?) viable either. You can *sense* the understanding between the two even though no words are exchanged.There are tons of other thought-provoking though seemingly invisible elements in this movie.  This includes the whole ""falling down"" leitmotif that requires an entire essay itself.The last thing I wish to touch upon is the fact that there are no perfect motives in the movie.  For example, when Foster is trashing Mr. Lee's store, we notice that a jar of American flags falls to the floor and breaks, almost defeating Foster's patriotic speech about Lee's corrupt business.  Later, after creating a scene at the Whammy Burger for being denied breakfast, Foster changes his mind and orders lunch instead.  We would like to sympathize with Foster for just wanting to see his family, but in the end we see how violently he kisses his wife, and suddenly it appears that he has gone perhaps a bit to far.  Each of these incidents inspires some sort of sympathy for Foster's aggressors, further testament to the fact that the line between good and bad has been blurred.This movie stole my heart with its previews.  No film I've ever seen comes close to being so fulfilling. Falling Down will satisfy 99% of its audience. Take my word for it.*please*.",Falling Down
253,matthew.hayes,A wasted opportunity,6,2 May 2000,This is a film with a seriously split personality.  Deep down in its core there's an interesting movie about how the stresses of everyday life drive a man over the edge and how little incidents of violence can escalate into major ones.  Unfortunately these interesting themes are swamped by the violence and misogyny designed to appeal to the worst prejudices of the audience.,Falling Down
254,Dasher111,Superb examination of violence and aggression in America,10,30 December 2004,"In Leonard Maltin's book, the entry for this film says, ""What exactly is the point?"" Well, Leonard, I'll tell you. FALLING DOWN is a critique of violence and aggression in America, particularly - but not limited to - white heterosexual males. The point of the movie is to demonstrate that America falsely celebrates itself as a ""land of opportunity"" and a ""melting pot""; rather, it's a powder keg of selfishness, arrogance, and prejudice that can cause anyone to snap for any reason.The movie suggests that this anger is learned at a young age through the media. Notice how the daughter of D-Fens (Michael Douglas) is playing with a water gun while watching violent cartoons. And of course, there is the boy who immediately assumes D-Fens is filming a movie because he has a bazooka. The boy then teaches him how to use the weapon because he saw it on TV.But the film doesn't lay the blame entirely on the media. It also covers the psychological aspect of violence, namely the impact of a person's work and family life on their state of mind. The movie perfectly shows how one can affect the other, while both affect the whole person. D-Fens was divorced, unemployed, and raised by a weirdly obsessive-compulsive mother (Lois Smith). His life - empty and routine - turned him into ""some kind of machine,"" as she put it. Meanwhile, Prendergast (Robert Duvall) had become a human punching bag at his job, picked on at work the same way he was picked on at home. It's only with the help of his sympathetic partner (Rachel Ticotin) that Prendergast is finally able to stand up to his co-workers and his wife. Sucker-punch notwithstanding, he used more appropriate forms of aggression than D-Fens did. Overall, this is a brilliant film with a lot to say about the violent and angry times we live in. It should really be seen by everyone.",Falling Down

I mean all my friends seemed to like it but I just found it lame and rather boring. It had heaps of potential, man slowly goes crazy in middle of busy town with base ball bat and guns, but it didn't seem to go anywhere. I found it extremely frustrating for that the fact that it slowly built up, through Mr Douglas starting out with a base ball bat going up to him getting a bag full of guns and even a rocket launcher, but then before it could turn into a blood thirsty, all action shoot out it just ended. There was no going back to the brothel with a collection of carefully concealed guns as in Taxi Driver. Or a ""say hello to my little friend"" style shoot out as in Scarface. It just ended. They also had some of the most stupid action scenes ever put to film, Mr Douglas firing a rocket launcher down a sewer comes to mind, which brings the whole level of the film right down from serious hard hitting drama to silly, unbelievable nonsense.

Foster is not a nice guy, he is not a good father, he is in fact a racist, xenophobic all over unpleasant guy, who in fact mirrors much of what is in society today, who in fact we identify with and mistakenly call heroes or anti-heroes in this case. ""I am the bad guy, how did that happen"", says it all, he is the bad guy, and most of us don't get it.A strange and wonderful movie with some great commentary on us as people, and our society as well. There is nothing in this movie to make us feel good about ourselves, other than the way Duvall deals with his life, his issues, his struggle. Foster is a failure, a loser, someone wrapped up in his own problems, angry with society - too much like many of us in society today. A self righteous loser bagging on losers - a very depressing movie. Nonetheless, I liked it, and would recommend this to all who wish to seriously take a look at themselves. You may learn something.",Falling Down
258,icgsinc,Unexplained craziness - unless we assume alcoholism,7,23 June 2006,"""Falling Down"" is a very amusing black comedy, with Michael Douglas playing a recently fired defense worker known by his license plate moniker, D-FENS. Stuck in a monumental traffic jam, D-FENS angrily abandons his car and begins walking to his destination: his ex-wife's home, to give his little girl a birthday gift.Along the way, he smashes up a Korean shopowner's store, stands up to gang members in a style we mere mortals have only dreamed, kills a Nazi, shoots up a phone booth and terrorizes employees and patrons at a fast-food restaurant. His ex-wife, played by Barbara Hershey, who knows he is coming over despite a restraining order, tells a cop she wants police protection. While he has never before become violent, he has ""a horrendous temper"" and she knows he might be capable of far worse. Still, in response to the cop's query (who at least knows enough to ask), she says he rarely drinks and doesn't use drugs. Yet, as with Anna Ayala, crazy, out-of-control behaviors are inexplicable unless we assume alcohol or other drug addiction.One reviewer claims that the point of the movie is to make a statement about society and that we should stand up for ourselves, albeit in more constructive and non-violent ways. And while we should, only an alcoholic is likely to go over the top the way D-FENS does, even though he is mostly reacting to behavioral manifestations of addiction in others (for example, the gang members, almost 100% of whom are substance addicts of one stripe or another). While healthy people may harbor fantasies of doing crazy things in response to idiotic rules and the rude behaviors of others, the neo-cortex, the human part of the brain responsible for restraining the impulses of the lower brain centers, usually prevents them from being acted out. This is not the case for alcoholics, whose damaged neo-cortex exercises far more limited restraint, a differential biochemistry discussed at length in my book, ""Myths and Realities of Alcoholism: Removing the Stigma of Society's Most Destructive Disease."" Another reviewer blames the recession that resulted in his layoff (the early '90s was an era of massive layoffs in the defense industry, to which D-FENS had devoted his life), but a layoff alone cannot account for insanity. While some may ask whether the fault is his for allowing himself to be driven over the edge or society's for pushing him there, addictionologists know that the odds of unrestrained violence are remote without damage to the frontal lobes of the brain, the most common cause of which is alcoholism.In my first of four books on the subject of alcohol and other-drug addiction, ""Drunks, Drugs & Debits: How to Recognize Addicts and Avoid Financial Abuse,"" I discuss another dark comedy, ""War of the Roses."" This would have been one of the greatest alcoholic movies ever if it had portrayed either main character (one of whom happens to be played by Michael Douglas) as drinking heavily. While recovering addicts know that the movie has addiction written all over it, most non-addicts think it's just about a psychotic couple whose love inexplicably turns to hatred over the course of a 17-year marriage. Similarly, ""Falling Down"" portrays a man with behavioral indications of an out-of-control limbic system (the pre-human, emotional brain), the normal cause of which is alcoholism. If we assume he hid his addiction well (as many do, even from their spouses), the movie makes sense. Still, it's a good movie, combining an appeal to our visceral emotions with some very amusing scenes and, not least, Robert Duvall in a wonderful role as the endearing Detective Prendergast as the only law enforcer able to put two and two together.",Falling Down

You will face problems everyday, problems of all sizes, minor or major, and they will absolutely annoy you to the brink of losing your sanity.Of course, every person will take it differently. Falling Down showed us how even a simple and decent human being could get frustrated by the obvious, gaping flaws of society.I think it's safe to say that there is no coherent story, it's just about our main protagonist ""D-Fens"" (Michael Douglas) who's trying to get home for his daughter's birthday who was taken from him by his divorced wife. And he faces a plethora of obnoxious problems on the way which slow him down. Sounds pretty horrible and boring when you put it on paper, but this is a perfect example of a movie that's driven by dialogue and characters rather than an exciting plot.You will feel all sorts of emotions while watching this due to the actions done and words spoken by our main character.

Because this is a retelling of the tale of Ulysses (Homer) who is homeward bound (a perilous journey after the wars) to resume life with his beloved Penelope.For those who have heard that this is a violent and racist film --- forget that.  D-Fens comes into several threatening circumstances as he wends his way home and he reacts to protect himself, acting with violence when he is threatened with violence. I admit one must consider what seems violent to him.  The toughs with the baseball bat or machine guns are clear enough examples.  The McDonalds and Korean shopkeeper scenes require empathy --- the violence here is that nothing is as it should be (to him). Remember the Bazooka?  The pawn shop episode shows D-Fens expressing moral outrage. Nothing about this film suggests Violence Exploitation to me.  It is all organic to the story.

269,slugnutty,Uneven Remake of The Swimmer,5,7 October 2003,"""Falling Down"" is remake of the 1968 film, ""The Swimmer,"" in which a man sets out on a delusional quest to reclaim his past. Michael Douglas plays Bill ""D-FENS"" Foster, a quiet, passive, seemingly decent man whose desire to see his daughter on her birthday begins to unravel into an urban journey of violence and madness. The film touches on social commentary, showing how civility and decency can be ripped out of a common man by an American society that is rude, greedy, predatory, and violent. Foster, the protagonist, has taken and bottled the slights for too long. Armed to the teeth, (completely by circumstance and not by premeditation), he takes matters into his own hands. It's an interesting twist, how the super straight Foster has to become an unstable, gun-toting nutjob in order to walk down the street unmolested, to be treated with courtesy at a fast food restaurant, or to buy a can of soda without being ripped off. In this way, the film touches a raw nerve with the average American, exploring the rage that flows like an undercurrent from a frequently cheated populace.Robert Duvall plays a detective, a mirror character to Foster, who shares the same desires for civility, courtesy, and respect in an increasingly uncivilized world. Duvall's quest is simply to get out of the game, to retire from the police force with his sanity intact before he too is pushed too far.By the end, Duvall and Douglas are pushed into an inevitable showdown. The sympathy that the film has built for Foster is then thrown out, as he is revealed for what he is, a failure of a man on what amounts to be little more than a violent temper tantrum. The film's early power seems drained away by this revelation and the audience is left feeling cheated and exploited. Instead of standing for decency and justice, Foster is ultimately revealed as a weakling and a coward. He says, ""So I'm the bad guy?"" without ever realizing why. It's a dissatisfying end after such an interesting and powerful start. It's a shame that the film raises interesting questions without having the stomach to tackle any of the answers.",Falling Down

The good guys are the ones who care about life and other people. The movie makes no qualms about clearly defining who's who.Its not supposed to be complicated. The other people in the movie are strangers in the perspective of the anti-hero, played by Michael Douglas (William Foster) and the movie is set in a camera narrative centering around his world and secondarily to Robert Duvall's character (Detective Prendergast). The minor characters are underdeveloped to not distract attention from the central figures in the movie, both troubled, both angry and frustrated, but who deal with their issues differently. Detective Prendergast, if he has a first name doesn't ever have it mentioned by his family or friends in the context of the movie. He is referred to a Prendergast, but there is some amount of character development centering around him. This is one of Robert Duvall's finest modern performances. He is sympathetic, brave, heroic and troubled by his life as a police officer and his wife's emotional problems. It would be simplistic, although not incorrect to call Detective Prendergast the hero of the movie, although the movie centers more around Bill Foster. Michael Douglas' portrayal of Foster is complicated. He is a nice man, concerned, thoughtful, but possessing a terrifying temper that is his Achilles' Heel.The minor characters are merely a backdrop. There are nice guys and bad guys in most every situation, whether the fast food restaurant shooting, or the police officers who show up to try and help Barbara Hershey (Beth Trevino, the ex-wife of Bill Foster). Some of them are overly offensive and obnoxious, where some are overly sweet and caring. This is, again, from the perspective of the violent, intelligent and angry Bill Foster who sees things as good and bad, polarized completely. He doesn't see subtleties in people, he only sees what his life has conditioned him to see, he reaches his breaking point and reacts with great volatility being kind and thoughtful one minute and angry and explosive the next. Some moments bring him back to his socialized facade of civility only to lose them once again. A man lost in the conflict between his morality, his anger, the people around him and the pain of a world he lives in that violates his preconceived ideas.This movie has a great deal of conflict and paradox, which is the point, I think. Its not supposed to be clear what happens or even what force motivates Bill Foster. Enjoy it. Its a great movie and has real rewatchability.",Falling Down
271,anton-79,Can be viewed in two ways,7,7 January 2006,"The first time I watched this film, I watched it as a revenge fantasy, and was quite disappointed by the ending, where the film turns into a more serious drama, and the protagonist becomes the bad guy.However, re-watching (a part of) this film with a more serious approach and with more distance to the protagonist is actually more interesting: You watch the protagonist going from a person that most viewers can identify with to someone nobody can identify with in small steps.Of course, the way I saw it at first, was that the protagonist was getting more and more unrealistic in classical action-film style, and that viewpoint broke down at the end (which caused the disappointment). Of course, if you ignore the last quarter of an hour or so (after the country club), you can still enjoy it as a revenge fantasy action film.",Falling Down
272,inspectorbob,a 26 year old Masterpiece!,9,17 September 2019,"It has been 26 years since this movie came out. I saw it finally yesterday after desiring to see it since it was first advertised on circuit all those years ago.
And what's my synopsis of this semi-vintage movie?...brilliant! So worth it! So much better than I ever imagined it could be! And not outdated at all!
I expected it would be a novel, fun, action-packed movie about a guy who's had enough; with something of a pointed statement/indictment against our modern urban society. And it is that...but also so much more!
This film is a masterpiece; it is beautiful and poignant art. There is not a scene or a shot or an utterance that is not absolutely intentional, loaded with depth and/or intrinsic to both the unfolding narrative and to its poetic depiction of humanity and the state of the world. It's a film that makes me feel robbed for having watched dozens of mindless one-dimensional action movies over these years. The writer (Ebbe Roe Smith), the director (Joel Shumacher), the awesome actors Douglas and Duvall and everyone involved with this production do not deserve a tinselly Oscar...they deserve a medal! And this movie deserves a shelf at the Louvre! And it most certainly deserves to be watched!
As for me, I will be grabbing my shovel and go tracing the seam of movies from these great artists in search for more undiscovered gold.
Last words: know that the language is not toned down and the very hard, very real issues that it deals with are weighty, so it's not for every audience or every occasion. But it couldn't have been any other way for being a look on real life. Phenomenal though that there is such hopefulness, joy, inspiration, overflowing humour and clever wit in this story. It is not at all a dark or depressing or ugly movie while it deals with matter in our society that is just that. It is like a great red wine that has the sweet and the bitter and the dry just perfectly balanced ... you take a sip, savour it and sigh out, in deep satisfaction!",Falling Down
273,stashyjon,What Price The American Dream?,8,23 July 2006,"America, land of opportunity, a place where all men are equal under god. All well and good, but in this film Joel Schumacher gives us a long hard look at the underbelly of American society, and the view isn't nice.In a society so in love with it's cars it has grid locked itself we encounter William 'D-Fens' Foster (Michael Douglas), a man who's American dream has been shattered. Estranged from his family, jobless and cruising for a nervous breakdown a former hero and a man who has worked (in the words of his on screen mother) 'Designing weapons to keep us safe from the communists', hits breaking point, snaps and sets out on a journey through the dark underbelly of capitalist society in an attempt to a home that for him no longer exists.We see a society where small business can vastly inflate their prices in the name of profit, where corporate food franchises sacrifice customer service and quality of produce on the alter of a branded image and false smiles. A society where racism and homophobia are allowed to flourish in the name of free speech and gangs are prepared to massacre in the name honour to protect a few acres of wasteland whilst the rich spend time and resources playing golf and protecting their property with barbed wire in an effort to keep the underclass out of sight nd out of mind.Through this mess stalks Douglas, asking the awkward questions, dealing the roughest form of justice and fighting just to survive in the sea of capitalist excess.Counterpoint this with Robert Duvall as Prenderghast, a mild mannered cop on his last day on the job. Here is a man for whom the American dream has worked. He loves his menopausal wife, likes his job and is looking to retire to Arizona his life's work well done. Prenderghast is the polar opposite of Foster, he likes to talk (in the film he fires one shot compared to hundreds of rounds Foster fires off) and does hes damnedest to keep the American dream intact for everyone.Don't get me wrong, this film is not anti-American, or anti-capitalist or anti-western, but it does ask some pointed questions and intelligently leaves the viewer to give his own answers. Add in the fact that is film is very well made, with some superb pacey editing, and some wonderfully claustrophobic atmospherics and two fine performances from Douglas and Duvall and you have a true gem of modern cinema that stands up to repeated viewings. Highly recommended.",Falling Down
274,jeuk,Falling Down To reality,9,16 December 2005,"I had this movie in my personal collection while living in California, and have been living in the UK for a few months. I parodied many of these experiences in my 20 or so years spent there, and this was always one of my favorites.Michael Douglas' portrayal of ""D-FENS"" was,I believe, his greatest triumph.William Foster (Douglas) had been canned from his government defence job, and leaves his clapped out old car, with the license plate ""D-FENS"", on the freeway and embarks on a walking crusade, on a very hot day, many miles to Venice Beach for his daughter's birthday celebration. He first encounters the Korean proprietor of a local convenience store, getting the better of him and relieving him of his baseball bat,used for (De-Fence). He then retires to a nearby park to repair a hole in his shoe, and is accosted by a pair of gang bangers. He uses the bat to see them off in good ol' Amarican boy fashion! He later encounters them again and manages to purloin from them a sports bag full of heavy armoury after they'd crashed the car they were using in the incompetent attempt to dispatch of him drive by style! Robert Duval performs equally well as the henpecked and put upon good guy cop on his last day with the LAPD.His wife has arranged for them to retire to Lake Havasu (London Bridge Havasu?)and he is only retiring early to please her. Meanwhile Foster has made his way to a Whammy Burger joint (very thinly disguised McDonald's) in order to seek some breakfast. He's informed by the very annoying manager that he's 2 minutes late and has to order from the lunch menu, but Foster has a bag full of firepower, so there's really no contest there! He has many more adventures, including giving a heart attack to an old golfing fart and eliminating a Nazi outdoors man store proprietor.Needless to say Duval turns out to be the hero of the day, after punching out an obnoxious colleague, and tracking D-FENS to Venice Pier. He also came out with one of the best lines of the movie, ""They lie to everyone, they lie to the fish""! I have to get back to California, it's home to me now, and when I get off that plane I'll kneel and kiss the asphalt! I'll be home with all the other crazies. Just 9 out of 10 for this one cos he still never got his breakfast!",Falling Down
275,ToddGack69,Very Underrated,8,5 February 2001,"Very little is made of this film, and unfairly so. To sum it up very quickly:  Michael Douglas is a divorced, working stiff, who is fed up with the way our society runs.  He then heads through the city, using all necessary means to make it ""home"".What makes this movie so enjoyable is how Douglas' character (Bill Foster) deals with his frustration.  As we see him tear his way through the neigbourhood, smashing up grocery stores who over-charge him or dishing it right back to street punks who think they own the city, you can't help but grin with envy.  We've all shared his problems, like ordering the perfect looking burger and winding up with a squashed mess. The difference is that we all just learn to lump it, whereas Foster unleashes a outburst straight out of our most raged-filled fantasies.The film as a whole does not glorify violence.  It is not so much an action movie, as it is a character study of two characters, played by Douglas and the always credible Robert Duval.""Falling Down"" is sucessful and enjoyable because of a high action element mixed with a well thought out script.

277,piechart2000,There's more to this film than you think,9,23 November 2001,"A lot of semi-educated liberals assume this film is about the festering xenophobia of America's middleclass whites. But I don't see that at all in this film. The script, very boldly, explores post cold war America and seems to ask this question: While we were busy defending ourselves from outsiders and fighting wars abroad did we forget what was wrong at home?The central character, played by Michael Douglas, represents old school, commie-fearing Uncle Sam. He's a man who has spent his life developing weapons to defend his country. Now he is, in every sense, redundant and is left wondering what he worked so hard to achieve.The film captured how many of us were feeling at the time. Opening with a traffic jam on a baking freeway, we immediately get the idea that all is not well in the land of the free. Despite all the tumultuous events of the 20th Century, all the wars, technology, science, politics and the hard lessons, despite the brief optimism felt as the wall came down, the dream of a better world is still so far away.Most of the characters we meet along the way represent nations which, at some point in history, the USA has been at war with: The Korean (economic), The Hispanics (land rights), the Nazis (ideology). We meet one solitary black man in the film, holding a banner which reads NOT ECOMINCALLY VIABLE. This speaks volumes and rams home the central message: We looked abroad to solve problems while we ignored our own. The Whammy Burger Bar scene is a representation of the inflexible and misleading' corporate world (even the child can clearly see what's wrong with this picture'), it captures a dissatisfaction that has gained much momentum since 1993.
Despite what was written in reviews of the time Douglas' character D-Fens' actually commits very few acts of violence in the film. The press yelled racist' too, but here's a story brave enough to avoid the token black-police-chief approach to race and show a world where everyone is potentially malicious. His mirror opposite in the story, played by Duvall, balances the bleak view of modern America nicely but, as we gradually discover how horrible and strange D-fens has become to his own wife and children, the film leaves thinking about how strange and horrible so much of American society has become.",Falling Down

Such man always becomes outside of the law, whether it be veteran of numerous wars or simple employee of a defensive industry. And who actually has suffered - gangsters with its ""p***ing ground"", the fascist or wife, which does not allow him to see the child, though he anybody earlier and finger has not touched, and it is simple "" looked as if could strike ""?

With both Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall on top form, this movie is a winner on every level.The movie starts off with Douglas' William Foster, a man with a BIG temper, stook in a traffic jam on the hottest day of the year. Foster gets very frustrated and abandons his car in the middle of the road. He goes to the nearest shop to get change for the phone and ends up trashing it over the price of a can of coke. After, he decides to walk home for his daughter's birthday, even though he knows his ex-wife has filed a re-staining order against him. On his way home he causes extreme mayhem. Now, Detective Prendergast (Duvall), on his retirement day, is determined to find out who is doing all these terrible crimes.Even though Dauglas is made out to be the bad guy, you can't help but feel sorry for him.

Or being cheated by your employer or shopkeepers. Or the very bad service at a diner. And also being intimidated by some no good hoodlums, the man simply doesn't take it anymore. I think that many, many ""normal"" people would like once to react to all these abuses, grievances, infringements and what have you, And once, only once would love to take a baseball bat and do exactly what Michael Douglas does in this delightful and sometimes very funny ""black"" movie.

Even though I have been a fan of this movie since around 2000, it still has all the relevant themes that contemporary films such as ""Joker"" and the even older 'Taxi Driver' have. The sad part is that something like this will always be relevant. The poor and struggling will always pay the price, either as villains or victims.

284,markdcampbell,Another social commentary?,5,5 October 2001,"The beginning of this film caught my interest. Especially with the little Fellini tribute in the car beneath the overpass (Fellini's 8 1/2). Very interesting. However, with most Schumacher films, the ambition to create a social commentary falls down as the film gets caught in the inevitable web of Hollywood schtick.The social points are clear: Overcharging for a Coca Cola in a convenience store is outrageous; Militant xenophobes live on every corner in the United States - true; but the movie gets carried away. Scenes like when the 11 year old shows him the ""correct way"" to fire a rocket launcher is simply silly and made me wake up to the fact that I was ""watching"" a Hollywood picture.The acting is not in question: Duvall is excellent, Douglas is great, and even Tuesday Weld is charming in her role as the annoying and fearful shut-in. However, Frederic Forest (Army store owner) is just way too over the top. He sounds like an exaggerated conduit for Shumacher himself.It's not a ""bad movie"" by any means. Very well crafted. The editing is good, the locations are great, but the comment here is that the story and the plot and even the point of the film are way too exaggerated and stretched.

293,Beaudro,"Asking the important question ""how far are any(or all) of us from societal collapse",10,8 April 2016,"This movie is truly excellent, on the level of being the kind of film that you can watch many times from the many different perspectives that life affords you over time.Fundamentally, D-FENS begins this movie teetering on the edge of the great abyss of savagery that at his core every man understands at some level. At this moment he is weighing in his mind what he has in life to hold on for and discovers...nothing! No job, no home, no family and in-turn no self respect. In response to this epiphany he decides to simply perform a basic act of visiting his involuntarily estranged daughter as there is no logical justification that he doesn't. Woven into this story are many excellent examples of how things such as Political Correctness and the state of mind that it induces have transformed the world we live in into a living hell. Not just Political Correctness but the whole ""no you can't, just in case"" culture of the modern world e.g. D-FENS Restraining Order has been granted not because of any violent acts he has committed but because ""there were times when I thought he might"". Just as Prendergast's restriction to desk duty that his wife insists on is based on him being wounded once in the line of duty. It begs the question of what should we do instead, just in case something might go wrong, nothing? And isn't the living I hell of the world that that philosophy in practice has created worse than the potentially negative outcomes of taking the risks of maybe hurting yourself or someone else or offending someone?The film is rich in allegory and metaphor with a clear parallel to draw between it's pro and antagonist. At the beginning of the movie D-FENS has lost everything; job, home, family and Prendergast is a man who has lost his only child and is on the brink of an involuntary premature retirement that will mean he will lose his last vestige of manhood and self-respect, in short, his feelings toward D-FENS are ones of empathy. The climax of the film, which is where the richest metaphor lies in that the two stand at the end of a pier, in Los Angeles(the western-most tip of the western world) where D- FENS is held at gun-point; where he is offered the option of surrendering his miserable existence on one side of the bars for the other when he does what is essentially the simultaneously selfless and selfish thing in one by bluffing Prendergast into a Draw- on-three when he is not really armed. This action is selfish for the obvious reason that D- FENS gets to commit suicide by-proxy(in-turn not facing the consequences of his actions) but selfless in that at the price of his courage to enter a confrontation without knowing that a safe outcome is guaranteed Prendergast gets to experience the uncertainty of life and the enjoyment of triumphing over it and in-turn realizes that his job may be the only thing he has to hold onto that stops him falling down the abyss that D-FENS has.This movie is brilliant because as a fan of post- apocalypse movies, which commonly come in the Sci-fi genre, this one is on it's own in that it is a contemporary post- apocalypse movie rich in many opposites; hope and despair, tragedy and comedy, with no clear hero or villain and the only thing setting D-FENS apart from anyone he comes into confrontation with being that D-FENS has consciously chosen to surrender his responsibility to society whereas his rivals have likely never asked such questions. One might say that this is a story of too much, too late; when D-FENS protests ""I did everything they told me"" I would respond by saying that that was what on a large scale had created the world we live in which these days when I see people pushing shopping carts, digging through trash, trying to find something of value to sell to make ends meet between welfare cheques I can't help but to conclude that this movie was ahead of it's time.",Falling Down

And he is seen showing compassion and sympathy to people of other racial backgrounds than his own - unless they are trying to rip him off or rub him out! He is ""guilty"" of being patriotic to an extent bordering on xenophobia which probably makes him mainstream American <smile>.To others he is a metaphor for their own frustrations with the ills of society. Sometimes apportioning views and motives to him that leave me scratching my head as to why they think that is so!For me the story is important as a sounding board for complaints that are too often ignored. Political correctness rules OK.Most times it's better to blow off steam with dialog rather than waiting for the explosion of a D-Fens.Dave.",Falling Down
298,freefly58,I loved kit,9,22 June 2008,I had the pleasure of watching this movie again seeing as I just purchased it for $4.00 to add to my movie collection. I loved it when I saw it in the theaters and it did not lose any of its appeal in the passing 18 years. I like to keep things as simple as possible so when I watch a movie and I try not to scrape to hard on the outer surface of the movie. The characters all did a likable job in their perspective rolls but having read some of the other reviews many disagreed--so be it--I think they all did a great job.For a movie that tries to entertain the viewer with a yarn about a man who finally snaps due the many pressures many of us have learned to deal with I came away pleased at the whole experience and recommend it to any one. Keep in mind that nothing is perfect and I am sure if you look hard enough you may be able to find fault in this movie but like I said I try not to scrape the surface too hard that's what documentaries are for not movies and if I wanted a lesson in contemporary affairs or history I'd go and take a class.,Falling Down

301,pelzco,best and most entertaining critics of society. still valid. (oh yeah),10,11 July 2016,"i happened to watch ""falling down"" some days ago and i was astonished - more than 20 years after shooting this movie's validity and force of expression didn't expire. not at all. michael douglas does a great performance as a mr. average, who surely has issues, but to be honest, he does all the stuff we want to do. not in that exaggerated baseball bat/gunbag manner, but it's hard to think of him as the superbad guy. because he's right in so many ways. e.g. the famous scene in the ""whammy burger"" chain where he's not allowed to get breakfast because it's 11.32 and they serve breakfast only until 11.30. didn't that happen to you as well and you thought - WTF? of course, you don't have a gym bag full of guns with you (hopefully!) so you won't get your breakfast and will eat your squishy smashed sad little burger that looks so super juicy and awesome on the vending poster. or the annoying guy in the central park demanding money from you because he hadn't been eating for days - saying this with a sandwich between his teeth. or that disgusting nazi guy... or or ...the thing is - he wouldn't have done any harm to no one, if only they would have let him alone and go (well, until the ending scenes, obviously). but it wasn't possible. this mr. average could be probably all of us on a super hot and very bad day. that's what makes it so freaky and so true and such an excellent movie in my eyes.",Falling Down

It is also one of those films that you get something else out of each time you see it. Of course, one might say that of virtually any picture but some just seem like Russian Dolls. The scene in the burger bar is still great: ""The customer is always right - that's not our policy, Sir"".

304,ndtm,"Great concept, poor film",4,8 January 2002,"This could have been a great film, but I found to be a big disappointment. It may still be a good film if someone would do it properly... i.e. a film about an average, honest, working guy who slowly loses control in the face of all the ailments of modern big city life (drugs, violence, grime, crime, etc.).  A film with a flawed but sympathetic character, who resorts to extreme measures to release his frustrations and exact some revenge on those who he sees as being responsible for the decay of the ""American way.""Instead what we have is a main character whom we can't root for, because not enough of his background or mindset is introduced up front; and when we do learn more about him, it doesn't make him more sympathetic at all.  Add to this a set of completely unrealistic cops and it just added up to frustration and a big letdown.  Also some annoying and cheap cliches (e.g. a detective on his last day at work - will he survive or not?  Oh, pulleeeze! How original!).",Falling Down

It shows that we are all on the verge of falling down except that we don't let ourselves because human character is usually strong enough to put up with the difficulties life dishes out.  One great scene shows Douglas being forced to put his left hand behind his back to be cuffed to the right as he is leaning over.  He says ""I can't, I'll fall down.""  It sums up the movie.  Without a little support from somewhere other than our own two feet, we'll fall down.

What happens when a man is 'Falling Down'? Well, you get an exaggerated, yet plausible, depiction of what could happen if a man is pushed too far in this movie.Michael Douglas is phenomenal as Bill ""D-FENS"" Foster in Joel Schumacher's griping tale of a man who is trying to see his daughter on her birthday. Seems simple enough, but this is turning out to be the worst day of Foster's life. At every turn he is faced with adversity. Whether it is something as potentially life threatening as being held captive by a neo-Nazi, or something as benign as arriving to late to have breakfast at a fast food restaurant; this man can't catch a break.The Sheer outrageousness of this events that take place in the movie give it a sharp sense of humor and a cynical view on the state of affairs in the modern day metropolis. This story is quite original and fairly well developed. As the situations Foster encounters get hairier, the tension builds to a fever pitch. There seems to be an automatic sense of sympathy with this character because he is the everyday American man. I found myself routing for him through thick and thin.I hope that most people will enjoy this roller-coaster ride of a movie, it was certainly a memorable experience for me.",Falling Down
308,sheagallagher,Falling Down,8,31 December 2013,"Falling Down is a smart, tense thriller, one that within a few minutes has you on the edge of your seat. From the very beginning, we are forced to live alongside William Foster (Michael Douglas) for a single day. One hot and sweaty summer, Foster abandons his car in the middle of a traffic jam and goes on an increasingly violent rampage to get his own back on society; all the while trying to make it very clear that he is not a vigilante; he just wants to get to his daughter's birthday party. It all comes together perfectly right before our eyes. So it all starts off tame, yet totally enthralling; we are shown the chaos of modern day life through the eyes of one man. William Foster strikes one as a regular, mild-mannered guy. Douglas plays him quietly, gently, capturing the mannerisms of an ordinary middle class man. But only mere minutes into the film, this relaxed façade is shelved and we are thrown into a shattering confrontation at a general store, where Foster explodes and releases his inner thoughts on society, behaviour and ethnicity. We see elements of Foster's normality throughout the film,but from act one onwards we don't look at him in quite the same way; in fact, we barely see a normal man at all. Although Falling Down is not an action movie, there is a firefight early on and once some angry Latino gangs get on Foster's trail, violence crops up quite often. It's not only gangs going after William Foster either; Sergeant Prendergast (played half-heartedly by Robert Duvall), on his last day before retirement and also quite fed-up with society, is quickly alerted of Foster's rampages and takes the case into his own hands. Before the intense stand-off in the finale, Foster runs into some trouble at a fast food joint, confronts a white supremacist surplus store owner, and launches an impressive attack on a group of lazy construction workers. The pacing throughout this tremendous movie is perfect, with the music keeping the tension palpable for the duration. Michael Douglas gives a spectacular performance from the get-go in both his quiet, emotional moments with his ex-wife and child, and his insane rampages as he becomes increasingly mentally unstable. Falling Down is taut, shocking and sometimes even darkly funny; the perfect mix of action, thrills and the ultimate social commentary.8/10",Falling Down
309,williamdejager,A victim of the modern age trying to get home,10,31 August 2005,"Is it just me or is this truly one of the best pictures from the last decade? Michael Douglas delivers an astonishing performance as D-Fens (William Foster) an ordinary guy, who has an obviously perfect job at the department of Defense, until he gets fired and his wife breaks up with him. The following opening credits are, according to my view, some of the best in motion picture history : the whole scene is just so extremely claustrophobic. D - Fens is just ''a victim of the modern age'' just like the writer's wife in A Clockwork Orange (another classic) who cannot stand the normal routine of living anymore, and begins a trial of violence in the asphalt Jungle called Los Angeles.",Falling Down

It features themes of anarchy and chaos, and can make one feel a little insecure about the state of things.

Michael Douglas' portrayal of Bill Foster as a man who feels so totally betrayed by his world that he finally cracks and no longer wants anything but to go home is riveting.

Especially at the beginning you really feel repulsed by the society which the main character is a part of. It's quite interesting, from time to time even humorous, to watch him as he takes revenge on the system. Of course it's a bit unrealistic but i am sure nearly everyone will spot a tiny smile on his own face when Michael Douglas gets even with the building workers for closing down the road for weeks without doing any repairs on it. But besides the main plot there is a subplot based around actor Robert Duvall. I don't want to say that he didn't do a good job, but I as a viewer just didn't care for him. I had to prevent myself from fast-forwarding through the scenes in which he played. In the end the film presents a solid criticism on modern society and an anti hero we might think represents us as the ""small people"".",Falling Down

Almost the same way teenagers could relate to the Travis Bickle character in Taxi Driver.The film portrays so many different peoples emotions eg. A fathers love for his deceased daughter to a neo Nazi's admiration of Hitler. Falling down basically shows how we, sadly as a nation are falling apart with greed and nastiness hence: Falling DownI would strongly recommend this film to anybody, because no matter who you are it will do something for you.

It's not that ham fisted. Instead it deals with the frustrations people face and contrasts extreme with more reasoned points of view. It doesn't try to preach to you.The trail of carnage and craziness that is left in the wake of this one man who's had enough is contributed to greatly by the vices of the crazy people he meets along the way.

319,tommyf11236,"""Falling Down"" Real Life Feelings",7,17 April 2005,"Falling Down is a movie which stars an excellent Michael Douglas, as a Los Angeles man who cannot cope with the every day pressures many people experience during their lifetime. While stuck in a traffic jam, William Foster/D-Fens (Douglas) gets out of his car, and leaves the car right where it is. He starts walking through Los Angeles. When Foster first starts out, he seems to be lost as to what he wants to do and where he is headed. Then his journey becomes a quest to get a birthday gift to his daughter. He must get from Point ""A"" to Point ""B"". As the movie progresses and he makes his way towards his ex-wife's house, we see that some of life's simple things become more important to him. We see him enter a fast food restaurant and order a breakfast meal, only to be told that he is a few minutes late and they won't take his order for that meal. What takes place in the following scene is Foster's drastic solution to a simple problem, giving new meaning to the old Burger King slogan "" Have It Your Way"". The plot has Foster go through a series of everyday challenging situations and solving them in an unconventional way. Actor Fredrick Forrest's performance as Nick the racist surplus store-owner is exceptional and convincing. Joel Schumacher does an impeccable job directing this particular scene. In fact, the entire film shows Schumacher's expertise in the directing field. As the movie progresses, you will get to know the character of Foster, and even though you realize he is no longer rational and on a rampage, you find yourself rooting for him as he deals with some of the mutants of today's society. Robert Duval is superb in portraying Prendergast, the Los Angeles's detective who tries to figure out which direction D-Fens is headed. Falling Down's writer Ebbe Roe Smith shows how Foster and Prendergast each deal with the future of their lives. He allows us to feel the frustration of becoming obsolete and dispensable. Keep an open mind and you will see this movie represents real life feelings in today's world. When viewed from that perspective, it can be a more rewarding film than what is portrayed at surface level. This movie provides good entertainment and is well worth seeing.",Falling Down

321,jake1st,Solid,9,10 September 2001,"I thought this film was excellent for a number of reasons. I know I'm in the minority but I prefer it to taxi driver.The inciting incident is placed in the first minute of the film so the audience doesn't have to endure 15/20 minutes of boring exposition. Douglas leaves his D-Fens on the highway, and wanders off into the highly dangerous LA suburbs, immediately hooking the audience.The way property is explored. Douglas is always on someone else's patch (korean shop, latino's backyard, bums park, man with stupid hat's golf course, neo-nazis shop, plastic surgeons house). This effectively emphasises his growing instability since leaving D-FENS (his property). Also, Douglas' armoury comprises of other peoples property (korean baseball bat, latinos knife & guns, nazis bazooka, daughters water pistol) conveying society's influence on his descent. Douglas' movement is met with increasing antagonism which mirrors the idea of a bridge falling down (a connector between two properties), until finally he is isolated on the pier with nowhere else to go.The dialogue is sharp and the sloganeering effective. All in all a great great film - Acting is good, directing is good, scriptwriting is great.My favourite bit of the film is when douglas walks to the latino's crashed car and picks up a gun. The latino begs for his life. Douglas shoots him in the leg, remarking : ""You see, that's the concept.""I give it a 9 out of 10",Falling Down
322,MattAlexG,"White-collar castoff tries to break the mold, as does the film",9,18 April 2002,"The Plight of the Little Guy has been a prevalent message in film and literature, and the theme has lost no relevance in these days of massive corporate mergers and business-oriented government.  Thus, ""Falling Down,"" a drama following a downsized, formerly dedicated defense contractor (""D-FENS,"" reads the vanity plate on his dilapidated hatchback), treads familiar plot territory, even for its release in 1993.  Fortunately, the film navigates its way around the potential for redundancy through a self-critical awareness of the clichés it uses to tell the story, using them as just one strength among many in this American allegory. For example, Robert Duvall plays the ubiquitous ""Last Day on the Job"" cop, but his colleagues jibe him about that very myth of the mortality of retiring police officers. Furthermore, Duvall's nuanced portrayal of the problems that age and meaningful relationships bring to a masculinity-dominated world allows his character to transcend any mere stereotype.  The film lets the viewer know that yes, it is aware of the cop cliché and no, Duvall's life is not picture perfect, either. In that same respect, Michael Douglas' protagonist Little Guy, while sympathetic in some respects, is not a very lovable character, and is downright reprehensible at times.  While some would criticize the filmmakers for the flaws in Douglas' character, the film provides enough evidence to show that D-FENS' estrangement from his family and society in general is at least partly his own fault.  Thus, ""Falling Down"" avoids the unrealistic depictions of saintly Everymen crushed under the foot of an Evil Empire like the recent Denzel Washington vehicle ""John Q.,"" and manages to present a complex (read: realistic) portrait of the problems in post-Cold War American society, most of which still exist.  After years of focusing on external threats during the Cold War of the Reagan Era, America was forced to examine its many problems at home, and ""Falling Down"" delves into them: latent racism, unemployment and inflation, drug culture, the apparent breakdown of the family unit. But I digress.  What I'm trying to say is that ""Falling Down"" presents a problematic picture of American society on purpose, and it's an entertaining and insightful picture at that.  Those who criticize the film for supposed racism need to realize that the story is told from the perspective of a middle-class American male Caucasian; no one in the movie claims that that is the right or even preferable perspective, it just happens to be the majority perspective.  The standard movie cliché of One Man Taking a Stand Against the System is that old democratic message; ""Falling Down"" adds a more specifically American tone.  The movie goes a bit further than the standard redemptive theme by adding that the one man taking a stand needs to face the problems within himself before trying to overcome those around him - or he may well find himself falling down.  The need for coming to terms with oneself before external reform, while particularly applicable to America in the early 1990s, is a fundamentally human message.  It's a message worth hearing, and ""Falling Down"" is a movie worth watching.",Falling Down
323,glopglop,Brilliant depiction of 90s America,9,13 August 2002,"Things don't look too good for D-FENS (Michael Douglas). The Cold War is over and there's no use for defense specialists like him anymore. He gets sacked and finds himself without any prospects in life whatsoever. His marriage has gone up sh*t creek some time ago, he's well over 30 but lives still with his mum.Future couldn't look gloomier. Without a job or a relationship to worry about he suddenly becomes aware of the dire state of society around him, the very same society that he so eagerly tried to protect form the commies in the past. This film is only partly about the 'falling down' of a single character. D-FENS' transformation from well-respected citizen to gun- slinging maniac is closely linked with his learning process, i.e. his rising awareness of the rotten state of society around him. His idealised notion of  America is gradually replaced by the more realistic but also very painful certainty that his values (eg honesty) are terribly old-fashioned. Nowadays, the heroes are plastic surgeons. Nowadays, the 10 year olds can teach you how to handle a rocket launcher. Nowadays, immigrants show no interest in becoming Americans anymore. Freedom of movement is a thing of the past, you've got to watch out for gangland graffiti now.The list goes on and on. This is a pessimistic movie. Or is it a realistic movie? Watch it and find out.

Here is another film which, over here in Oz at least, made little impact at the cinema but a huge impression on those who have seen this masterpiece. I don't think I have seen a lead performance like this since Jack Nicholson in ""Cuckoos Nest"". I stumbled across this film at the video store and rented it out of curiosity. Well, to say my curiosity got the better of me is an understatement. From start to finish there is a mix of action, humour, drama and irony.You can't take your eyes from the screen.

From the psychopath in the army surplus store, punk home boys, condescending fast food staff,profiteering store owner, smart guy road worker, whining wife and the many police officers the viewer gets a snapshot of western society gone horribly wrong.It could be any country that is close to losing the social conscience it once had, in this case it is the U.S. There is one scene where an unemployed, protesting guy calls out to D-Fens, ""Don't forget me"".

From the ever lovely Deedee Pfiefer, the tantalizing maturity of the beautiful Barbara Hershey and the sexiness of Rachel Ticotin as a female ""officer-ess"" to Frederik Forrest's hilarious, quote-filled performance as a racist, Army/Navy shop owner...this film deserves to be immortalized in all it's elaborate perfection! Filled with great quotes from the very beginning to the last moments this film this movie is by far one of the best, most hilarious and yet most down to earth pieces of art that I have personally come across in a long, long time! Bill D-Fense takes the seemingly absurd, but almost necessary actions of which most Americans only dream despite the fact that he may be a little crazy and in need of some sort of help. This film really hit home for me and through Bill's confusion and psychotic thoughts and actions I can feel his sense of longing and yearning for the only tangible thing which he has ever had in his life...his wife and child.Pay close attention to this film as it is a lesson in so many things dealing with many simple subjects. I vote 10/10!!!",Falling Down
330,Mark-204,What we'd all like to do,8,3 January 1999,This movie is great because of the dry humor used throughout. In some of the situations I have been in and can relate on how I would have liked to do what he did. It really explores what the fast paced 90's are all about.,Falling Down
331,Mr.Buff,"One film, Two different reactions",10,16 June 1999,"What makes this film so unique is the feelings you can get from watching it more than once.  Seeing it in the theaters, I thought the film was a great action film that redefined the notion of black comedy.  I laughed at many of the scenes of ultra-violence and couldn't help but root for Foster as he makes his was home.  But a girl behind me was very upset, as she stuck her finger in my face angrily and said I should see this film again because I missed the point.  The truth is that she missed it too.  There are so many feelings this movie generates on multiple levels that it cannot be pigeonholed.  Watching the film for a second time, I saw a dark, scary, and emotionally wrecked Foster.  This is Joel Schumacher's best film",Falling Down
332,dirtyjon,Douglas at his best- great story,10,13 July 1999,"This is perhaps one of my all-time favorite movies. It tells the story of a drone that has had enough.He's an all American guy who has simple old fashioned beliefs and is tired of seeing things go wrong. I love this movie on so many levels. In a blind way, it's hilarious. Crashing up stores with baseball bats, shooting up fast food chains and making fun of gangsters is great fun.But the movie has some really great dilemmas as well. The police see him as the ""bad guy"" but we can see him as any one of us, who has just been pushed a bit too far. It could be you or me.In one memorable scene, a redneck KKK army-type guy sees him as being just like him. But Douglas is disgusted by this. He's not racist. He's just patriotic.",Falling Down

I had gone to the recomendation list, and Die Hard was listed there. Die Hard and Falling Down are nothing alike. (Yes I did like Die Hard). Falling Down is more of a story of a person with problems. He faces them in a rather unique way. You will see how if you watch the movie, and look at the box for the movie. I found I really connected with the ""bad guy"" even though I dont really know why. This movie was very thought provoking. (Otherwise I wouldn't have written a review.) If a movie leaves you thinking after you have seen it, then you know it did its job. I gave the movie a 7, thats a good score by my standards. I would highly recommend this movie.",Falling Down
334,The Shape-2,The king of the urban jungle,8,11 January 2001,"** May contain spoilers **This film has to rank among my favourite Top 10. It's totally awesome. To begin with I thought 'Michael Douglas, playing psycho, short hair cut, i don't think so', but he played the part almost impeccably. It gave a brave commentary on how life is in the urban jungle and showed what could happen if someone had enough with all that was wrong, and then set it straight. To be fair though, he didn't actually intend to go around killing people and generally causing chaos, it found him. I think the most memorable image from this film was when 'D-Fens' had shot the latino thug, picked up the bag of assorted firearms, and proceeded to walk towards the crowd. The music in the background gave the impression he was a vigilante superhero. My only concern with this film was the stupid comedic set-pieces ie the boy telling him how to operate a bazooka, and then him firing the rocket down the manhole.All in all, after having seen this film twice, it has done enough to remain as one of my favourites.8 marks out of 10",Falling Down

He represented us who put up with people's crap all day long and people who spit and walk over his face not being afraid of who he is. Douglas has proved to the world that even the most quiet fellows can be dangerous. I love this movie every step of the way.

Just look at the situations in the movie. Did people not understand this movie? I think because of the way the movie was shot people look at it like a B movie but if you really think about it, it's far from that. There are so many parts that are just purely classic. You can relate to so many things in this movie. That's what the movie was trying to do. It was suppose to show you this little story about this average guy who goes off of the deep end... but then you look closer and you realize how many things you can truly relate to. How many things subconsciously frustrate you and how you never do anything about it. It shows how life is a double edged sword for some people, showing you that if you take matters into your own hands it comes back to you in the end and if you play by the rules you get screwed over. If you were to ask me what I thought about this film after I first saw it I would say that the movie was a cult classic. But sadly it's an underrated forgotten movie. I love this film. I give it 10 stars. If I could give it 11 I would. A movie that will be forever misunderstood.",Falling Down
339,sky-115,Did he really do anything wrong?,9,19 October 2009,"Interesting to read reactions to the ""anti-hero"" Bill Foster's violent rampage through Lost Angeles as he walks home to his estranged wife and daughter. While we should have some sympathy for this guy who snaps under the frustrations and irritations of life does this excuse his actions? Some reviewers feel that Foster didn't really do anything wrong. On the contrary, his murdering of the neo-Nazi by shooting him in cold blood and his gloating over the elderly golf player dying of a heart attack verge on pure evil. One wonders whether he would have murdered his family then suicided if given the chance. The only good thing he did was to allow himself to be shot so that his daughter would get the insurance. But for all that, a riveting film.",Falling Down
340,perdue93,One of Michael Douglas' best performances,8,14 November 2010,"This is a very under rated film to begin with. Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance as an ordinary working man, tired with the flaws of society, begins to take out his true feelings on them. These feelings cause him to work up to the state of insanity. The side story is Robert Duvall playing a soon to retire cop tracking down Michael Douglas trying to figure out who is causing all the trouble through the city. You are on the side of Michael Douglas as you feel sorry for him. All he wants to do is get home to his daughter on her birthday. His x-wife is keeping him from getting there with police reports and Douglas is taking out his anger on the things wrong in society. A very great movie. I found myself laughing because he performs crimes for the plain fact that he wants life to be fair. I highly recommend this film.",Falling Down

Foster on his way to attend his daughter's birthday party at the home of his ex-wife (Barbara Hershey), Foster leaves his vehicle and begins walking, running into one problem after another. He also slowly loses it, finally snapping at a fast food restaurant (a spoof of McDonald's) that refuses to serve him breakfast because he was late. Foster also known as ""D-FENS"" because of his custom license plate quickly becomes a source of terror to some, a hero to others.

343,muvieBUFF,Michael Douglas shines!,7,24 May 2004,"I watched this movie for the first time on digital cable last year; I enjoyed it, but felt rather bored with the drawn out sub plot featuring Duvall and his mentally ill wife. I was hoping that the tedious scenes with Duvall and his wife would tie into something of more significance, or at least have something remotely to do with Michael Douglas and his self proclaimed sinless rampage across the town. (spoilers) I guess the point that was trying to be made was that his wife had a mental illness, and he was trying to catch Beth's mentally ill ex husband Foster (Douglas)... Either way the movie in my opinion could have had done better there with the unlimited talent of Duvall. I recently rented this movie from Blockbuster on DVD and liked even more, considering skipping the Duvall scenes (except for the ending) was just one button away! Douglas is amazing in this movie and he convinced me that he wasn't ""The Bad Guy"" after all...I recommend this movie for any Michael Douglas fan! 7 out of 10.",Falling Down

What makes it ""intelligent"" is that the lead character, although engaged in acts of extreme violence (but not particularly gratuitous!)is someone who somehow elicits empathy as a working stiff who has been pushed too far by society itself, and that upon reflection at movie's end ( where the ability to generate reflection is alone strongly indicative of a superior example of the genre ) one finds himself wondering about the ""big picture"" of our society and just /who is/ the bad-guy in all the murder and mayhem that one see's and reads about in the media.",Falling Down

I myself was on the point of breakdown until I saw this tale of urban reality.  Mike Douglas is outstanding in the role of a man on the edge. There are so many sub-plots extracting the Michael from the whole ""American Dream"".  We've all wanted to do what Mike did in the Whammy burger and ""beat down"" prices in corner shops.  By the way, wasn't the Korean a cool dresser?  Anyway, I must mention the character who gives me the greatest thrill, the Surplus Store Owner.  Wasn't his hat the greatest and as for those sunglasses well enough said, but just what are the two queer guys up to now, ""Think about it"". The only fault I can find in the film is when our ""vigilante friend"" shakes the can of gas, claiming it to be empty, when it is quite clear there is something inside it.  Oh yeah, how did that pier break so easily, I mean a young kid could have leaned on it and fallen in, and surely(if you don't mind me calling you that), Robert Duvall must know the difference between a gun and a water pistol.

His mom is stunned - she has been fixing his lunch and he has been going to work every day.  Where has he been going? Thats the point of this movie - a man who has given his best for his country and in the end he gets screwed by everyone.  There is nothing left to cling to, no reality.

Instead of sailing along the Mississippi River, William Foster (Michael Douglas does an incredible job) travels through the city from a congested highway under construction to his ex-wife's house - to see his daughter on her birthday - despite the restraining order. Through his journey, we encounter a number of races and economic/social classes - notice that the only integrating white males are the policeman, William, and the Navy/Army surplus store owner. We encounter Hispanic gangs, Arab and Korean store owners, and a black protester - an extreme influence to William. William happens to have a bad temper, and this only acts as a plot devise for his journey. William is also put up as a Jesus figure - even accentuated by his temper in destroying merchandise because of corrupt store owners (Jesus turning over the currency tables). The list goes on.

351,nathangore,Every man has his breaking point,7,31 August 2000,"Brilliant, rivetting, chilling. Three words synonymous with the magnificence that is Joel Schumacher's Falling Down. Schumacher's captivating cinematography is once again displayed at its finest in what is, arguably, one of the most shocking films of the modern era. Michael Douglas heads an the cast as an unemployed single father rushing to get ""home"" for his daughters birthday. In the midst of a large traffic hold up on one of the hottest days in history, he steps out of his car and crosses the road walking towards the other side of town. Thus beginning the countdown to his inevitable self destruction. Caught between everyday people and situations, he fails to control the pressures placed on him with the absence of his personal and professional life. His painful existence soon gets the better of him as modern day society feels the wrath of one man pushed too far. Not too far behind Douglas is Robert DuVall, a veteran cop on his last day on the job, trying to track him down and put an end to the torment. The script has been  beautifully cast and the acting is simply stunning as Douglas and DuVall clash head to head, one not knowing he is being pursued and the latter not knowing who he is after. Schumacher's direction is superb capturing all the emotion and fear with unsurpassed realism. Watching Falling Down once is simply not enough. Mind you those with sensitive ears will want to keep the volume to a minimum as profanity rocks the screen throughout, however it does, it most cases add to the tense atmosphere that is generated continuously throughout the film. Overall Falling Down is a disturbing look at 20th Century society and the life of an ordinary man driven beyond the limits of sanity. It is a chilling portrayal of a single life painstakingly pushed towards self-destruction, which conveys only one message - ""every man has his breaking point.""",Falling Down

To not see this film ever is a crime, far from the ones our main character ""Bill"" commits. D-Fens as his license plate identifies him as, spends the day, ""going home"" to his daughter's birthday, along the way meeting an assortment of characters, whom many of us, would probably like to see treated the way they are in this film, but due to our day to day realities, no one has the nerve to!Take the lay-about asking for change, the construction workers ""fixing the street"" or the staff of a fast food chain all as prime examples.

From his performance in Wall Street to Wonder Boys, he has proved himself to be versatile talent spanning four decades. This was certainly a different role for him and he approaches it well. Robert Duvall also does an outstanding job as he plays an affable hero that everyone can relate to. Falling Down is one of my favorite movies.

358,niangelo,A good revenge flick - against society,6,1 August 2005,"This movie is a revenge flick at heart. There are elements of ""race against time"" and ""aging cop taking one last job"" and ""psychotic snap"" but really, the original thing is D-Fens lashing out against everything that bugs everyone - the arrogant jerk in an overpriced suit yelling at the old lady, the plastic niceties of the fast-food restaurant, and the lack of human decency in general in much of society, particularly in major cities.Which is where the film's fault also falls: Duvall is excellent, but disposable in light of the story. The wife and kids are merely window dressing to set the plot. Douglas shines, gleefully reacting out of base instincts. These aren't even deep psychological manifestations, just things everyone has daydreamed about while sweltering in a traffic jam.So while the detectives piece together the crimes and the wife grows wary of her approaching husband, we wish for these scenes to pass just so we can see Douglas shooting more payphones. And when he starts to go really crazy, we feel bad - we've lost our hero, and we have none by the time the movie ends.",Falling Down
359,yankcrime15,"What We Think, D-Fens Acts Out",9,25 April 2011,"If there is a film that manages to showcase how constant turmoil in society can completely transform a man into a forceful voice, that film would be called Falling Down. To be honest, it's a bit awkward that a director like Joel Schumacher could have directed this, but don't let what happened to Batman cause any skepticism. This is a film that we can all relate to in some extent.Michael Douglas' character as William ""D-Fens"" Foster depicts this antihero at a stage in his life that he is completely fed up with everything, and all he wants to do is to see his daughter for her birthday, despite a restraining order set from his ex-wife. D-Fens is emotionally unstable at best, not accepting any turned down remarks and always questioning people. Even though he may be causing a ruckus to store owners, restaurant managers and gang members to name a few, we still find D-Fens to be a likable character for stating his message in the most effective ways, whether blood is to be shed or rounds are to be fired.A cop on his last day retirement, played by Robert Duvall, is kept on his toes about this situation, and he will follow down any traces. Even though his co-workers and wife do not approve of this and prefer him to take it easy on his last work day, he won't stop until he gets his hands on D-Fens.Society in general can manage to bring out the worst of us, and Falling Down just proves this further. Sure, it's unethical to cause destruction and mayhem to speak your voice of dissatisfaction, but in this film, all the restraints are broken and the city of Los Angeles is receiving its payback to the mental destruction of this man. Not many films will address it like this anymore.",Falling Down

This movie shows excellently what is wrong with modern society. Not to mention the parallel story of an ordinary police officer, that everyone mocks him out for his passive stance, until he stands up and proves to everyone that they are wrong. Great depiction of real-life events and excellent play (most notably Douglas as D-fens). However - social situation was already dire in 1993, now it's only worse. Maybe making a remake and placing it into present environment (aproximatelly 20 years after the original) wouldn't be such a bad idea.

361,joenoy95,"Deep, psychological and silencing.",8,22 January 2013,"Form the very outset the film portrays a sense of familiarity with the general frustrations of life; traffic, arguments and general hassle. The acting display was impeccable, faultless from Michael Douglass. I loved the depth and meaningful expressions that were reflected on each of the faces of the actors. Although taken to the 'nth' degree, there is a feeling that is shown in this film, a feeling of why, a feeling that is deep. Why can't things just go right? Why is it so easy to turn a good guy in to a bad guy? Stress is the issue! This is a film that you need to add to your watch list. It will silence you through out its duration and capture many emotions felt in life. Sometimes with films such as this you don't want them to end; this is no exception, and when it finally does come to an ending, it is remarkably satisfying (Although somewhat of a clichéd) you feel content that the mainline story has come to its close and all underlying story lines have been tied up. I do however appreciate that some people's choice of ending is one of suspense or one that allows the imagination to take over. In that case you might die from an overwhelming feeling of 'contentness'. You have been warned! It is a must watch whether your 18 or 80. It's a real emotional roller coaster.

362,christopherwalken_,Excellent Movie,10,16 April 2005,"This movie is among my favourites, I saw ""the Assassination of Richard Nixon"" recently which is very similar to Falling Down. Sean Penn is the leading actor, his performance is extraordinary and i definitely think he should get another award for his performance in that movie. Anyways, turning back to falling down. D-fens is a very controversial character, he can be viewed either as a true man, believing in good values, or either as a total lunatic. In my point of view, he's something in between... Many good scenes, especially the fast food joint and the golf course scenes. The Assassination of Richard Nixon and Falling down are two of my favourite movies, but they will probably not appeal to the mainstream audience since they are too controversial and intelligent, leaving interpretation to the audience.",Falling Down
363,CAmovieguy,Gets better every time I watch it.,9,12 July 2007,I have seen this movie 5 times.Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall give great performances. The film centers around Michael Douglas who is a defense man building missiles to protect our country. In midst of a horrid traffic jam Douglas's character finally boils over and leaves his car exclaiming he's going home...home to see his ex wife and daughter.On his way he encounters various obstacles and encounters we as citizens of America have experienced ourselves. Douglas's rage escalates throughout the film for a one of a kind climax.Lots of poignant statements about society in this film.

364,tcorbet,"Really, really good",10,21 July 2009,"As anyone can see who reads this, I don't do this much. I am only doing it now out of some probably-mistaken idea that if I take the time to comment on what I think was a superb movie, not only will it be seen more often, but maybe that the people responsible will even get their due compliments for pursuing their profession so well.01. Michael Douglas gives a very good performance in a very difficult role. Somehow the people who rate such things need something of the platform diving paradigm -- degree of difficulty. A very good performance in a very difficult role is much higher praise than a very good performance in a role that any qualified actor ought to be able to perform in their sleep.02. Robert Duvall, it might be said, especially since I guess I now know that his performance in ""A Civil Action"" was, sort of a reprise, is probably panned elsewhere by those who do this often as 'just being Robert Duvall'. I don't think so. I see on the screen an actor of immense skill, immense experience guiding that skill, and a result that was a delivery of what the screen writer and the director asked of him, beyond what they could have hoped from whatever dialog they wrote or stage direction they provided.03. Barbara Hershey could be overlooked, but I think that she played the role, understated as appropriate to the overall production, perfectly. Don't overlook those grainy scenes from their home movies -- that was the actor on stage as well. If you close your eyes and let your memory of the film remind you of the all the women pushed to the side by a film script that ultimately plays two male protagonists against each other, you'll see Tuesday Weld, perhaps over-playing a not-too-attractive role as Mrs. Prendergast, and you'll see the love/fear of Mrs. Foster from Lois Smith, but above all you will think of Foster's ex-wife dealing with a husband forcing a child on to an unwanted rocking horse, and know that a whole lot of acting was powerfully delivered in a low-key style.04. And finally there is my praise of 'tone' -- tone in the photography, tone in the soundtrack, and finally, the philosophical tone of the story as it plays out. I don't know enough about the film business to know to whom that praise should go. First, I have the feeling that the original writing did not do as good a job of managing tone, so I am sure that whoever takes a book or a play and turns it into a movie, did that. Second, I don't know where the naming of the film came from, but it certainly, in retrospect, must bear some of the burden for the generally-low-success the film achieved. There is so much more here than 'falling down'. A title also portends a tone, and the subtle tones of this production were so much more than what anyone scanning the TV listings would expect from ""Falling Down"".As I said up front, I don't do this much, but I suspect that ""Out of Order"", ""Venice Heat"", or even ""Retired"" would have worked better. I can also think of a worse title, ""Lake Havasu"", but I think if that showed up on the TV re-run list, it would have at least as good a draw as ""Falling Down"". This film deserves to be seen more than once.",Falling Down
365,hscholler,Excellent Michael Douglas in an uncomfortable movie about American society,9,6 November 2005,"The scenery is starting in a traffic jam: The protagonist, William Foster played by Douglas, is caught in the usual stress of not being able to get away from this annoying every-day scene. Surrounded by people who also have to cope with it. Children shouting, drivers swearing, phoning, honking and other ways of bearing the waiting time. The cinematography is reflecting well the uneasiness of Foster as he sweats and seemingly looses his temper during the stay. Not being enough, a fly in his car makes him slap around aggressively while a little girl watches his movement from the backseat of a car as if she knew what dangerous potential of ""D-Fens"" Foster will show later on. Then he makes a decision: He WILL leave this situation, leave the car and climb up the hill to go home...This is the starting point of Foster's mental ""falling down"". It seems to be a strange behaviour to leave your car behind and escape from the jam. But to be honest - haven't you ever thought of just doing this?! Such a behaviour seems strange yet one could understand it as it means no real harm to anyone around him.Later, one gets to know that this man has lost his family, job and is not ""economically viable"". In this hostile situation, thoughts about what you have forgone in your life may explain and defend this naive escape motivation. He escapes this dead-end - symbolized by a jam - to get home.In the next scene the sympathy towards the protagonist gets lost or changes into a feeling of unsettlement and pity. He might have just chilled out a few moments on the top of the hill/walked around to calm down and return to his car. But he does not. Instead, Foster get sucked into a maelstrom of aggression which he of course provokes.The movie is full of details about Foster's anger about society. A general anger which everyone has felt before but not uttered in such a direct and crude way. There are dozens of pictures of the decadence of the USA (a decadence which can be found in all western societies but to a special amount in the US): Overpriced goods in stores, gang-land area, people carrying guns (even automatic military weapons), the delusion of fast-food, racism, neo Nazis having their freedom, drug addicts, aids-suffering folk, beggars begging for money, D-Fens constructing weapons of mass destruction, divorce and a man not being allowed to see his child anymore, decadence of golf-sites, economically non-viable people,...... See for yourself your will find many examples throughout the film. And Foster is in the middle of it, realizing that this is not only unjust. He knows the he has also fallen victim of his surrounding society. Especially the scene where the cops get hold of the black guy protesting in the front of the bank is addressed to Foster. The police car stops and the protestant stares at Foster to tell him ""don't forget me"". This scene seems to be Foster's point of no return. He won't forget, he will get his right to go home! In fact, it is a desperate right, a right of socially marginalized person, an illusion.Noteworthy is the way how Foster's potential violence comes to life. When he enters the Korean corner store the viewer does not realize that he will turn out to be a dangerous man with aggressive behaviour. Everything stars harmless when Foster just asks for change money to use a phone. It is the usual counter aggression of racism that drives Foster to use inappropriate measures. ""No change, you have to buy something"". Foster hesitates but still accepts this silent offense by purchasing a coke. When he realizes that the price of this drink is exaggerated and will not leave enough money for his phone call he makes a last effort. He asks for 50 cents in exchange for a dollar (!). Even that offer is refused by clerk. Now Foster gives way to his anger and gets started about the inflicted rights of the consumers. His rage cumulates to point where the clerk feels unsafe and tries to produce a bat to force Foster out. Violence creates counter-violence and Foster gets hold of the bat palpability. Now having the power he ""interrogates"" the clerk of the prices of the other goods in the store relieving his anger on batting around in the corner store. But Foster never hits the clerk and finally even pays for the coke taking his change from the cash and leaving the store like a normal customer: ""It was a pleasure of frequenting this establishment!"".If you carefully revise this scene you see that it is not Foster who starts to be aggressive. It is an understandable reaction of his to get angry facing provocations like these. Also the way of taking out a weapon as a defence is inappropriate. Maybe a short palpability as reaction might not be seen as Foster's guilt. The situation gets out of hand. It seems to be an aggression based on racism of an Asian and white guy. But still the above mentioned sympathy for the protagonist is vanishing as his behaviour is unsettling. Foster's potential violence is present now. Nevertheless, the viewer is left with the feeling that Foster had a bad day and does not really want this.Michael Douglas plays Foster's psychotic development in a very plastic and authentic way. Douglas does not just emerge as a violent berserker. He reflects Foster's inner despair ambiguously: Foster is not a man without feelings, yet, he is a man letting out too many feelings on the spot. Driven by his love for his daughter he fights his way through a hostile environment and society. He is only dangerous when people provoke him. He has lost his inhibition. Foster goes amok. In fact, this has happened several times in reality. Think about it.",Falling Down

371,Hubitron 2000,This movie is racist (plot spoilers ahead!),5,17 February 2001,"Roger Ebert wrote that some audience members may find this movie racist because of a ""facile reading"" of the film, a superficial judgement not based on further examination: ""Some will even find it racist because the targets of the film's hero are African-American, Latino and Korean - with a few whites thrown in for balance.""  I find it racist, however, because it fails to target the film's ""hero"" as a perpetrator who refuses to acknowledge his own white privileges; a perpetrator who honestly believes that HE (as a representative of the American ideal of a middle-class, white male) is the target of brutal racism from the racially marginalized.  This film attempts to perpetuate the notion that the American ""norm"" is indeed a middle-class white male, and that the tradition of this ideal is being compromised by ethnic diversity, implying that whites are the new social victims.`Falling Down has been widely reviewed as an Everyman tale and D-Fens characterized as 'Joe Normal', 'average citizen', 'universal hero', or simply 'all of us' (Carol Clover 8).  This is particularly relevant in that each phrase relates to the notion of unmarked terms.  White privilege is defined by having access to these terms (i.e. `ordinary', `normal', or simply `American').  This `universal hero' concept, though, is particularly frightening.  One aspect which is so dangerous about the movie Falling Down is the audience reception of white males who see D-Fens as `patriotic.' Many audience members closely identify with D-Fens's actions, or at least the motivation behind them.  The director himself, Joel Schumacher, also contends, `This is not a bad guy, but he's had it' (Clover 7).  Even the blurb on the cover `appears to lend moral endorsement to the actions of the central character: 'The adventures of an ordinary man at war with the everyday world' (Gabriel 130).  And this is precisely how many moviegoers viewed D-Fens, as an `ordinary man' who is justified in fighting back as a victim.This perception of D-Fens as a victim is a result of several factors. Casting lent a hand to introducing `yet another oppressed white male,' as Michael Douglas had recently finished Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct (Gabriel 131).  Most importantly, however, is D-Fens's series of adventures through L.A., and the social, racial lens through which Schumacher presented them.This lens is one based on sympathy for D-Fens's character (as implied by Schumacher's afore-mentioned statement) as opposed to the people he encounters.  `Where audiences might be expected to empathize with [D-Fens's] adversaries, an 'allegiance switch' is contained, both by the use of humor and by restricting audiences' access primarily to one point of view' (Gabriel 135).An early scene which takes place in a small grocery store owned by a Korean immigrant sets the stage for D-Fens's first encounter.  John Gabriel's interviewees (i.e. select audience members) sympathized with D-Fens when he could not successfully get change from the Korean owner without buying an `overpriced' soda (Gabriel 135).  D-Fens is outraged at the Korean's `self-righteous overcharging' and takes a bat to his store, shouting ignorant babble about the Korean `invading his country' and so on (Clover 8).  In U.S. theaters this was reportedly met with shouts and applause from white males.  Yet the victim, for having to pay 35 cents more than expected for a soda, is not the hardworking Korean grocer, but rather the white, middle-class vandal.D-Fens is also presented as innocent in a future episode of the film, in which D-Fens meets with the owner of an army surplus salesman named Nick. A `homophobic, racist, anti-environmental, misogynist neo-Nazi,' Nick hides D-Fens when the police come their way in search of him (Clover 8).  Here D-Fens is set up perfectly to regain any camaraderie with the audience members that may have been lost after the Korean store incident.  When Nick's racist and bigoted attitudes are revealed, D-Fens calls him a `sick a**hole' and shoots him.  For D-Fens to kill the neo-Nazi, sweeping the path for democracy and justice, he is comparatively presented as the patriotic hero, even despite his earlier faults.  `By locating genocidal viciousness and insanity in the neo-Nazi (and indeed having D-Fens kill him, moralizing about freedom of speech as he does so) the film can define D-Fens as your average short-tempered neighbor who just happened to break one day' (Clover 8).  In other words, although the incident with the Korean grocer may have exposed D-Fens's racism, the incident with the neo-Nazi served to redeem him and present him once again as `the good guy.'The very elusive and `invisible' subject of whiteness is imperative in racial discourse.  As Carol Clover describes, `It is the great unmarked or default category of western culture, the one that never needed to define itself, the standard against which other categories have calculated their difference' (Clover 9).  For studies in race to further social progress, this notion must be annihilated, thus revealing whiteness as an ethnicity no different than any other.  If this can be accomplished, than the prevalence of white privilege can be broken down, as it should.  In closing, it's important to realize that the inherent problem in Falling Down, and indeed the tradition which characterizes most of the media, is not that it recognizes whites as social victims, but that it fails to recognize those innumerable privileges with which whites are bestowed each day for no other reason than being white.Now I don't consider myself a social commentator by any stretch.  I'm just a college student who has read a few articles on this subject.  I suggest, however, that before people praise this film any further, they read through the following sources:Berger, Maurice.

373,haveyouseenhim,A fairly bland telling of a potentially great story.,3,22 July 2006,"When I first heard about this movie, it seemed like just the type of movie that I would enjoy greatly. I had a preconceived notion that this film would be one of those great pieces that had fallen by the wayside over the years, perhaps because its subject matter and overall tone were a bit too unique for the average moviegoer. This was before I found out who directed, however. The first scene of the movie, a well-edited sequence that does a great job of establishing the claustrophobic world that manages to get the better of William Foster, upheld my initial expectations for the movie. And I did enjoy the various situations in which Douglas finally stands up for himself where he would normally back down (""I just want some breakfast.""). The rest of the film, however, tended to disappoint. For one, the entire idea of Michael Douglas' character stalking his estranged wife and child seemed very clichéd and detracted from the movie's ability to explore William Foster as a unique individual and not simply one more one-dimensional, Hollywood-safe psychotic. Adding to this disappointment was the continued involvement of the police department in the entire affair. I would have much rather seen more time focused on William and taken away from Duvall's character's plight as he tracks a potential killer on his last day before retirement. I came to see the misunderstood individual and to learn something about him, and not simply to watch as the good cop solves everything. The conclusion offers no further creativity and simply continues on the film's path of mediocrity and blandness, further solidifying its status as a potentially great story severely damaged by the director's willingness to stoop to tired ideas and clichéd characters. Even the small twist in the end could have been seen from a mile away.",Falling Down
374,pgbk,"""I'm sick of punks like this screwing over hard workers because their grandfather got off the boat here, not them""",1,18 July 2020,"What cannot be taken away from the film is pretentious plot psychologism, which is replete with acute social and a little political unrest and should flare up from the caricatured stupidity of most of the characters. William Foster, signed in the credits as D-Fens, does not carry the mystery that is usually laid in the main maniac characters.A maniac in a shirt, with a tie, with glasses, at first, only does that racists are at enmity with immigrants, fiercely defending their consumer rights, their personal space, their Americanism, just not patriotically citing extracts from the constitution. He is a citizen of a great country. He is American. He does not know exactly how much money his country gave Korea, but he is sure that a lot. And in gratitude, the Korean cashier demands a blatant almost a dollar for a can of cola. He beats up the Latinos, takes away their weapons, and calmly walks on. But if he meets a neo-nazi who hates blacks and gay people, he immediately declares that he is an honest American, he respects other people's rights to life in his country and he despises the Nazis. After all, this is a completely different article in the laws. The fact that he trashed a Korean's store over a can of cola and that he disagreed with a Nazi are two scenes from different films that are not connected by the same motive.But D-Fens continues on the bloody road out of democracy, as if his insanity is America's overall result on migration and economic issues. After all, his goal is not to put things in order in the town with a gun in the name of a girl. He just goes to his daughter on foot and just EVERYTHING gets in his way: repairs on the road, a huge golf course, and a private house surrounded by barbed wire. Over time, he turns from a defender of his rights to an oppressor of the rights of others. And on the other side, he is confronted by the only cop who does not behave like a ""cop"" - he doesn't ask for trouble, doesn't swear, isn't rude. In general, not cool. All cops are cool. They drink all night long, and then with a hangover, they catch robbers and don't feel pain if they are shot at.The social subtext of a sad madman is destroyed by the fact that D-Fens was a psycho, in the beginning, there are obvious hints of this. He is not a victim of society, he is its disease, which suddenly escalated and began to affect all organs of the state apparatus, from legislative to executive. This is more of a sad bible about another messiah trying to die for our sins - it is Foster's job of trying on social sins in fact, which is proved by the fact that he quotes everything he heard on the street on his way home. And everything would be possible, even satisfactory, if not for the caricatured orgy of images, where even a positive character can hardly sympathize with.",Falling Down
375,Spyro_K,One truly fascinating approach to some profound themes.,10,15 February 2021,"Falling Down has to be one of the 90s most interesting surprises, one of my personal favourite movies and possibly one of the greatest films that is still relevant to this day. Directed with nerve and style by director Joel Schumaher (a controversial one as well, who has given us movies like The Client, Phone Booth, The Lost Boys and Falling Down, and pieces of trash like his Batman films), and written with wit by Ebbe Roe Smith, the film concerns a middle aged Bill Foster (Michal Douglas in his best role, in my opinion), who has the worst day of his life. Virtually every person is against him, he is caught up in a traffic congestion in the middle of the hottest day of the year without air conditioning, he is fired from his defense job (a hint which explains his nickname D-FENS) and it is his daughter's birthday. Obviously annoyed by the ruthless society that incessantly crushes him psychologically, he gets out of his car and starts walking through L.A. in order to get to his ex-wife's house for his daughter's birthday. He will come across relentless Mexican gangs, narrow minded store owners, Nazis and egotistical old golf players that aren't much of a hindrance to Bill, since there is no going back, he has fallen down, he has had enough of the concrete jungle/ post industrial revolution society that has forgotten him and attacks him, and he is willing to fight back for justice, using any weapon possible. Only Martin Prendergast (a nice performance by Robert Duvall), an aging cop on the day of his retirement, wil dare to Bill's psychotic, albeit justifiable madness.
Let's start with some basic technical aspects and then go to the more profound parts of the film. Starting with the cinematography, I gotta say that the movie is very well shot. It provokes feelings of ugliness and everyday tension, something that is truly important for the character of Foster. The use of run down summer, bright colours are obviously used to create an very thick and bustling summer atmosphere and the occasionally frantic movements of the camera give every scene a breath of fresh air. The score is haunting, masterfully composed by J.N. Howard, with use of melancholic trumpet for the end, a conglomertion of metallic sounds that build up tension and powerful brass and percussion bits that enhance certain scenes. Foster's make up is excellent, since it evokes that obsolete, 60s feeling, which gives us a lot more information about his character (note that the movie is supposed to take place in 1993, some years after the Cold War's end, meaning that there was no need for more power plant defense workers to exist, resulting possibly in Foster being fired from his job). Art Direction and Sound are great as always.
About some heavier themes of the movie, I would say that the movie tackles them most well (like the American Dream and capitalism). The most obvious is society. You could say that this film was the 90s' Joker, since we are presented a character downtrodden by society that goes ona rampage in the city. But why? I believe that Foster's anger and sadness comes from his more intimate life, particularly his family. His wife seemingly breaks up with him for no reason and is given custoday of their child because she is the mother (another interesting theme: feminism). He has lost his family, now his job (because of the aforementioned reasons, also an interesting theme: a post Cold War society) and his dignity and social life. He can't seem to find another job, as he is over educated, he can;t comprehend the new generations and their lifestyle, but most importantly, he cannot understand the over regualtion and the rules, that drive everyone mad under the right conditions. His rampage is therefore justified, as we, the audience, feel the need the cheer when he threatens the fast food restaurant manager because of his refusal to serve a four minute delayed breakfast, we want to congratulate him when he trashes the store of a Korean for giving the price of at least 2 dollars (with inflation) to a can of soda, we support him when he beats up two gang memebers when they threaten him for no reason. You couls say that Foster is a true antihero, a man whose unethical actions feel correct, and that is what gives its character charm.Overall, I highly reccomend Falling Down,a parable of consumerism/ commercialism, preposterous problems of modern life and the economy. Even if you don't feel like over ananlyzing this film, watch it nevertheless because it is also brutal black comedy with loads of action, well written characters and a climactic ending that will leave you in the end thinking: Are we falling down?",Falling Down

This film updates the entire concept with the premise that someone actually steps out of his car in Los Angeles, where nobody walks except those who don't have a car, bus-fare, or a need to actually leave their neighbourhoud.Our so-called hero steps out of his bubble, and engages an entire sub-culture that makes no sense to him, but requires a hostile response to the events that befall him. I'm not sure that I would be as adaptable, but Los Angelians would know. How far would you go to extricate yourself (and ultimately your loved ones) from an environment of arbitrary violence? As someone said, ""There seems to be no clear message. Who was right? Who was wrong? It becomes a very blurry line over the approximately 2 hours of the movie's run."" Are we expected to agonize over who was right or wrong? Even in my little Canadian home-town, I was threatened with handguns and worse in my early days (late 60s, early 70s) and had no particular recourse for any of this, outside of avoiding this network of acquaintances, having survived.Should we all be assured a hygienic and risk-free environment as soon as we step outside of our comfort zones? Does the casual Social Contract even approach this concept - especially in uber-cities? No - you plays yer money, and you takes yer chance. Common sense remains the least common commodity.

388,Eddy-Dowd,Misguided in the second half,7,28 January 2011,"When i review a film, i give it an /5 for the first half and an /5 for the second. And, for this film, Falling Down, the first half gets 5/5, due to fabulous direction, dialogue, and a real sense of a gun as a leit motif. Im sure that when watching this film, from the start you would be aware that he will get a gun, and he will slowly deteriorate into a murderer. And the start of this film really gives this impression that he is in fact a broken man, prepared to let loose and return societies cruelty, almost comedically meeting different every day frustration that a normal man might, yet making him seem like you or me.However, the second half, i only give 2/5. This is based on the fact that, with a build up of this man prepared to start causing havoc, but fizzles out a bit, as well as losing the leit motif of a gun after he gets one, it seems like it wasn't worth doing in the first place. And his apparent 'killing spree', only involves killing two people, one was an accident, when he gives him a heart attack after firing his shotgun, but also destroying the mans pills. The other was in self defence. I'm not saying that I wanted a violet film, but maybe the suggestion that he was willing to kill anyone to get his way, even if only suggested. I give the second half 1 star for the character portrayal, as it was fabulous and realistic. I gave the other star for inventive ending, giving birth to other brilliant film endings such as that of Gran Torino. It didn't get a star for story, locations or speed. I found a pier too much of a cliché, and the story progressed far too quickly, for example, the transition between house and pier. Also, the story in the second half was far weaker than that of the first half. In summary, with one of the best opening scenes, and fabulous scene setting, it was let down by a lack of character direction, love him, hate him, feel sorry for him, hate him again, disappointing. But comes back with a fabulous ending.",Falling Down
389,markd24,try watching it again (spoilers),10,20 May 2003,"The hero of this film isn't actually Michael Douglas' character - it's Robert Duvall's.  The film puts Douglas and Duvall up as counterpoints to one another - two men who have both been dealt nasty hands by life but with two contrasting ways of dealing with it.  Douglas has lost his job, his wife, his daughter and his dog, while Duvall's child died very young, his wife has never recovered from this loss and he hates his job (only one person there actually likes him).  But the point is, Duvall never loses his grip on reality, never gives in to the temptation that Douglas does, to take out all of his frustrations on whatever is to hand.  Instead, he accepts his lot in life and tries to make the best of it.  Douglas just gets mad, wreaks havoc and carnage, gets revenge on the world for what he thinks it's done to him, and ultimately pays the price for that.  The message here seems to be that while it might be cool to flip out, to take out your frustrations against life in general on other people, this won't get you anywhere - those frustrations aren't unique to you, everyone has them, and the only way to cope with them and have a happy life is to accept them and deal with them. Douglas has his day, vents his anger, and gets shot - Duvall keeps hold of himself despite life's provocations, and walks off into the sunset at the end of the movie.",Falling Down
390,BADBOY4EVER11,Why is this such a great MOVIE!,10,26 August 2003,"This film let's us see how or life is falling in too pieces. Not only that, but also can we see a MADMAN at work. This could have been a good fellow, but the people never gave him a chance. For ex: He wants breakfast, but they won't give it to him. I agree that after he asked nicely, his temper gets a little ""OF THE HOOK""",Falling Down
391,xstevec,I *liked* the shifting character emphasis,9,11 October 2003,"Hmmm...well, I *liked* the shift in emphasis from Douglas to Duvall as the film progressed.  Since others didn't maybe I should explain.Early on, you need to be inside Douglas to feel him snapping, but once he's gone it would be repetitive (and depressing) to continue focusing on that line.  Then, our empathy for him naturally drops a bit...sure he's in despair and understandably angry, but should he be killing all these people? They play up the comedy angles to make it bearable.Meanwhile, Duvall's character is ""experiencing"" early in the film rather than ""expressing"", e.g. feeling the weirdness of being a short-timer at work.  The scene with the captain trying to talk him out of quitting is priceless.  He says no and really means it.  Then at the end he winds up talking *himself* out of quitting, and that's when he has something to *say*.  Hence most of Duvall's lines are nearer the end. I think it was a logical solution.A wonderful performance from Duvall, as usual.  And the best role of Douglas's career IMO; something other than the super-successful over-confident sneering jerk he so often plays.  He does a fine job on it, both the fraying cable mind-snapping, and the sadness of a guy who had good intentions but has fallen beyond the point of return.  ""You mean I'm the bad guy...how did that happen?"".Good film.",Falling Down
392,hallogallo,dreadful (possible spoilers),1,3 November 2004,"(Before I start can I just say I am not a troll, but only came to these pages simply to double check this films title after I wanted to put it forward as one of the worst I have seen. Figured while I'm here I may as well pass comment...) It is rare that I stumble across a movie with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever but this is one.Here Michael Douglas plays possibly the most dislikable character in the history of cinema, a pathetic racist yuppie bully, who having been charged to much for a can of coke (or something) decides to go on a murderous rampage because he's 40 years old and p****d off his life didn't work out as nice as it could have.Truly dreadful and offensive. Utter small-minded hatfull garbage. I can not believe I actually sat through this to the end (I guess I just wanted to see him inevitably die at the end).Do not rent/buy/tape this film. It is truly awful.0 out of 10",Falling Down
393,LEWOKC,I FEEL A LITTLE MORE LIKE WILLIAM EVERY DAY,8,2 November 2004,"My hero William is the typical alpha male of the American dream. He takes care of his family and all those social responsibilities we endure without complaint. Everyone has a fantasy of acting out against all those aches and pains of daily life. This is our story! As William throws aside the weight of passive political correctness and speaks and acts his mind, he represents all our dreams. The only unfortunate part of the movie is its limited scope. I would have loved to see William take his vengeance out on more of those stereotypes who plague our existence: people with full carts in the express lane, drivers who can't handle a four way stop, and cashiers who can't count back change, just to name a few. For all those out there who make life a little harder for the rest of us, just remember: there is a William in all of us trying to get out.",Falling Down
394,w_imdb-863-250037,A few fresh thoughts on a great movie,9,5 December 2013,"Watching this movie again tonight, it occurred to me how influential this film truly was, if not so much within the film world as in the video-game world. There is more than a hint of Grand Theft Auto about this film. We see the narrative unfolding from the point of view of Michael Douglas and the police, but it's mainly Douglas' view that I'm talking about. We see how he starts out in his car, stationary, literally going nowhere. Then he realizes his mission: he has to go home. So you can imagine a little arrow pointing in the direction of 'home', in this case the already well trodden GTA neighborhood of Venice Beach, and off he goes as the crow flies. On his way he fights with the convenience store owner and gets his first weapon upgrade, a baseball bat. He quickly upgrades again to a flick-knife but things really take off when he gets a whole bag full of guns following a botched drive-by shooting.Along the way he gets distracted from his mission. He shoots up a burger place, shoots up a phone box and blows up a construction site. This impulsive drive to release all the tension that's been building up in this guy's head is great to watch and is so similar to how most of us play GTA that it's uncanny. The best part, for me, wanton violence and destruction of irritating stuff aside, is when he's in his final confrontation with Robert Duval. It's the moment that he realizes that he's not the hero of his story, but the bad guy. This, again, resonates in some of the more cerebral video-games of today, perhaps most notably Shadow of the Colossus. Obviously, the films has influences of its own but that's not for now. I do love the Macbeth-inspired soliloquy on the 'point of no return'. That was a masterstroke. The point is that, like most good films, there's more than one way to read this. And I like the fact that you can view it in many different ways. It means I'll watch it again, and again, and again.",Falling Down
395,spencer-04634,Wow,10,1 December 2020,Michael Douglas at his absolute best. A very underrated movie. Watch it you won't be disappointed,Falling Down
396,Scholesy82,greatest film ever.,10,24 August 2005,"Unbelievable. If ever a movie had it all - comedy, suspense, and an accurately painted picture of what's wrong with society and how it could get worse - this was it. It teaches us lessons which anyone who has ever lived in a big city will be familiar with, and asks the basic question: is violence, greed and fascism turning ordinary, grounded people into violent, greedy fascists? Duvall and Douglas give incredible performances. Anyone accusing D-Fens of being a psychopath miss the point completely - does he ever actually set out to kill anyone in this film? Any deaths that occur are due to him defending himself; the shooting of Rachel Ticotin's character occurs in a blind panic.Go see.",Falling Down
397,cabbagehead666,Ridiculous stereotypes undermine agenda driven flick,1,24 March 2006,"William Foster has issues. Unemployment and a failed marriage precipitate a mental collapse that takes Foster on a psychotic rampage, during which he terrorizes an assortment of clichéd characters, almost none of whom have the means, ability, wit or gumption to defend themselves.The parade of feckless victims undermines the movies believability: people simply are not the politically correct stereotypes portrayed in Falling Down. Most of the victims are portrayed broadly and ineffectively, except for a nice, albeit brief, turn by John Diehl as a father who behaves in a calm, nuanced manner that seems appropriate to the extreme situation.One of the movie's more galling conceits manifests itself at the Duvall character's farewell party, where the world-weary cop dutifully surrenders his pistol, reinforcing the filmmakers message of ""only active duty police should have guns."" This ignores the fact that in the United States, almost all police officers own their own sidearms; only SWAT weapons such as MP 5s are departmental issue.This is preliminary to the movie's climax and final conceit, in which Foster's wife gets possession of Foster's gun - and promptly throws it in the ocean, as if it is a snake and not a practical means to protect herself. The film makers sacrifice a legitimate, common sense ending to their film in order to underscore their message that civilians are helpless victims. Most people, even those bereft of even a modicum of intelligence, would still do the common sense thing and hold onto the gun for self protection.The perpetrators of Falling Down, a poorly done agenda driven flick that advances the reductionist, dilettante (and quite frankly totalitarian) dogma of ""only the police should have guns"", sacrifice the considerable talents of Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall on the altar of political correctness.",Falling Down
398,ssshively9,no longer viable,9,23 November 2006,"Falling down probably wasn't the best film of it's year and it's not one of the all time greats, but there is a lot of truth in it. In this film, Douglas plays an outdated, irrelevant man who nobody wants to acknowledge. The idea behind this, one that is not directly addressed in the film, is that Douglas is a sentimentalist at heart, and remembers a time and place in America where society was orderly and traditional.However, by 1993, the world has moved on and Douglas is living in the past. This is the underlying anger that motivates his irrational attacks on symbols of modern economics, elitist values, and racial/sexual insurgents. The movie is instantly relatable and stirring for anyone who has felt left behind.",Falling Down
399,jennt-2,Don't mess with D-Fens,10,26 September 2006,This a movie about a man who gets even with society. He was just fired a month ago in the movie. He is not allowed to see his his ex-wife and kid who he wants to be with so much. His buttons just get pushed way too much on this very hot summer day and he reacts to everyone that gets in his way. A Korean guy won't give him change unless he buys something. A fast food restaurant won't serve him breakfast just because he's three minutes late. A really disturbed man in an army store fights with him just because Michael Douglas disagrees with him. Two gang bangers won't let him get a little rest on their territory. I feel bad for Michael Douglas in this movie because he really wants to see his wife and kid in the movie and he can't. I think he really thinks they're all still together and he hasn't been with them for quite some time-i think years. But I like the way he stands up to everybody that ticks him off. I think this movie is great.,Falling Down
400,smacktastic,Musical Globe,8,17 February 2007,"Awesome movie! Love the commentary on society, its decline etc. Michael Douglas is perfect in this role. Just wondering if anyone else noticed the part where Det. Pendergast had his wife on the phone, played a musical globe and it played London Bridge. London bridge lyrics in case you have them are as follows: ""London Bridge is falling down, falling down, falling down"". Also, in the ""not economically viable"" scene Douglas buys a musical globe from a street merchant. It also plays London Bridge. How clever! Anyhow, good movie, good cast. Seems like it is a little preachy and nostalgic though. Either way I recommend it fully.",Falling Down
