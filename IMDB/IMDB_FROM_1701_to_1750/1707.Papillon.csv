0,MartinHafer,"Provided you understand the film is NOT based on a true story, it's a very good film",9,19 July 2006,"This film is supposedly based on the true account of a prisoner who escaped from Devil's Island in French Guiana. However, the book by Henri Charriere about his experiences apparently has a LOT of inconsistencies and outright fabrications (a polite way of saying he was a liar). So, provided you understand that this isn't quite a true story, this is still an exceptional film. Much of this is due to incredible acting, direction, scripting and makeup.Henri Charriere, played by Steve McQueen, is going to Devil's Island for killing a pimp--supposedly in self-defense. On the boat, he meets a swindler played by Dustin Hoffman and they become friends.Most of the film documents how harsh and awful life is in the prison came--either in the work camps or when living in solitary confinement. All take their toll and kill off many of the prisoners, by Charriere is resilient. Despite all these privations, he never loses his resolve to escape, though Hoffman eventually does and accepts his life on the island after one failed escape attempt. In the end, Charriere does escape, though in real-life, this apparently did NOT occur.While there is a lot more to the movie and what I have mentioned (after all it's a very long and involved film), the full impact of the story is not what you read but seeing the awfulness of the prison. So, be prepared for a movie that at times is very difficult to watch but is constructed it's an amazing film.",Papillon
1,bkoganbing,Butterfly Man Of Devil's Island,9,18 October 2007,"Watching Papillon today it occurred to me that the film it most resembles is Birdman of Alcatraz. Both Steve McQueen and Burt Lancaster were sent to prison for murder convictions although allegedly McQueen was innocent. Both were based on true characters who wrote, in the case of Lancaster ghost wrote, their own memoirs of their time in the joint and the films are based on those books. And certainly both men were rebel spirits.In Lancaster's case it's an internal rebellion against the rules of the penal system. Of course in the work he did developing those bird remedies, he rehabilitated himself in a way that 'the system' did not understand. But in the case of Henri Charriere aka Papillon for the butterfly tattoo on his chest, he just wants out of the penal colony at Devil's Island and makes many attempts to get shed of the place. The film is about his many attempts and his refusal to quit no matter what is done to break him. Devil's Island in the Thirties was not any better than it was when Alfred Dreyfus was doing his time in the tropical prison. Still McQueen is resourceful enough as you will see.McQueen though he's far from French has the rebel persona that really fits this part. Had he been younger and this been a French production I could have seen Jean Gabin in the role. It's one of McQueen's best roles and he holds your interest throughout this nearly three hour film.Leading an impressive supporting cast is Dustin Hoffman who plays what we would now call a white collar criminal. He becomes a devoted acolyte of McQueen seeing he's going to need friends himself if he's to survive Devil's Island. He also wants to escape in the worst possible way.Later on we see Hoffman in a different light as if completing the Birdman of Alcatraz analogy, Hoffman's role is similar to that of Telly Savalas who's a tough character when we first meet him in Birdman, but later becomes acclimated to prison life. Hoffman has worked himself into a nice situation relatively speaking on the Island and has resigned himself that this is his home for better or worse. It's a very good performance by Hoffman as his character changes during the film.I'd really recommend seeing both Birdman of Alcatraz and Papillon back to back. It's a good prison doubleheader for a rainy afternoon.",Papillon
2,Leofwine_draca,A bona fide classic,10,24 February 2014,"Regardless of its veracity as a true story, PAPILLON is a wonderful piece of movie-making. It's a prison breakout movie that transcends its genre origins to become a study of the human condition, exploring man's endurance and survival against the harshest elements. Featuring a couple of stand-out turns from the lead actors, this is an underrated classic and a film that you never hear much about, which is criminal.Steve McQueen, still effortlessly cool a good ten years or so after THE GREAT ESCAPE, plays another con, this time a Frenchman with the tattoo of a butterfly on his chest - hence his name, 'Papillon'. He's sent to a French penal colony in Guyana, where he endures the kind of extreme conditions that would send most of us to the loony bin. The film that follows is absolutely gripping from beginning to end, even though it's fairly slow-paced for a lot of it.It's worth mentioning Dustin Hoffman, lending brilliant support as the short-sighted fellow con, and Franklin J. Schaffner's direction, which wrings every drop of sweat out of the grimy and dirty conditions. I'm also guessing this must have been a big hit in Italy, because the cannibal movie sub-genre that followed shamelessly rips this film off, from the jungle traps and natives to the crippled man attempting to navigate the depths of the jungle with only a stick to help him.",Papillon
3,SnoopyStyle,great humor and touching,9,6 January 2015,"Henri ""Papillon (butterfly)"" Charierre (Steve McQueen) is a safecracker who claims to be innocent of murdering a pimp. He is sentenced to life and imprisoned in the notorious penal colony in French Guyana. On the voyage there, he offers his bodyguard services to forger Louis Degas (Dustin Hoffman) who sold fake government bonds. Degas has enemies like the prison guard who has family that lost money in the fake bonds. Papillon vows to escape. The colony conditions are horrific. He is put into solitary confinement but he continues to plan for his escape.This is possibly McQueen's best performance. Sure he's the cool guy but he gets to do a lot more. He gets to be weak in solitary and he gets to be old in the last act. Hoffman injects great comedic chemistry for the duo. There is great gallows humor early on. The crocodile scene is shocking and hilarious. There are great touching moments. And that cliff jump is insane. That's a thrill only a real stunt gives.",Papillon
4,Prismark10,Float like a butterfly,8,14 September 2013,"Steve McQueen was very much the poster boy for the definition of 'laconic cool.'He was alongside Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Clint Eastwood as the superstars of the late 1960s and 1970s cinema after hits such as The Getaway, Bullitt, The Thomas Crown Affair and earlier successes such as The Magnificent Seven and The Great Escape.However McQueen was very much regarded as a populist actor, a star unlike those method men such as Brando, Pacino, Hoffman etc.Papillon was an attempt to redress the balance. With Dustin Hoffman in the cast wearing those thick lenses, he knew he had to up his game. It's a, intriguing, fascinating and harrowing tale.The true story it is based on might have been embellished. This tale of Henri 'Papillon' Charriere who is sentenced to life in a French penal colony for a murder of a pimp which he claims he did not do.His bonding with Hoffman's forger Louis Dega who holds out for his beautiful wife which we glimpse in the beginning to find a way to set him free is the real heart of the film.Papillon's many attempts to escape prison does remind you of his earlier film The Great Escape. The prison scenes are disturbing with inhumane aspects, the latter part of the film set in Devil's Island where we see McQueen age with a seemingly broken spirit. He looks odd with his gait but it does lead to a resounding climax.1974 was a strong acting year, neither McQueen or Hoffman were nominated for acting Oscars which now seems puzzling.",Papillon
5,kosmasp,Free mind(s),9,14 February 2021,"Steve McQueen was a movie star. You can tell when you watch his movies. With little effort he could convey so much. And with a story like this, it was necessary too. I watched this before I went on to see how they did the remake of it. You could say that they did a better opening in the remake or you could agree with the throwing into the cold water treatment you get here ... you are left more or less clueless about so many things when it comes to the main character. I guess you can read up on him - since he really existed. Or you could just enjoy the ride you get - well it's more of a stay than a ride, but you get what I mean.The will of men to long for freedom is great. That does not need explanation. And as I said, you are not being served many anyway in this movie. But you are getting a classic treatment. A they don't do movies like that anymore kind of epic filmmaking in the wild. For some that may be aging badly, for others it may just be the best thing to happen or to watch. The movie does have it's slower moments for sure - you have to be aware of this. This is not just an exciting watch - quite the opposite will be true. But it still is an exciting watch no matter how slow it moves and evolves ... it's all a matter of perspective. Something that you may think our main character is lacking ... or is he? Giving him Dustin Hoffman as a ""side kick"" (not really the best description I could give him, side player?) also works wonders ... A classic movie that a remake treatment, which brought the classic movie back to the forefront again",Papillon
6,classicsoncall,"""Forget France, and put your clothes on.""",8,7 December 2017,"""Papillon"" is the kind of movie that shows to what lengths persevering men will go to, to achieve freedom. I've not read the Henri Charriere novel that was the basis for the film, though I'm guided in that direction by the film and other reviewers here. Just contemplating the horrors of being an inmate at St. Laurent Prison is enough to make one ill; seeing some of them depicted is downright nauseating. Eating bugs and going dark in solitary is not a pleasant prospect.Steve McQueen is excellent in one of his career defining roles, and it was interesting to see hints of Ratso Rizzo (""Midnight Cowboy"") and the future Raymond Babbitt (""Rain Man"") in Dustin Hoffman's portrayal of Louie Dega. The one disconnect I had with the picture though was with Dega's reputation as the best counterfeiter in France. Bereft of any possessions in prison, especially when banished to a French Guiana penal colony, what resources did he have to produce all the currency Papillon used for his various bribes? An additional scene or two, even brief ones, might have shed some light on that.But overall, this is an engaging film with an established star of the era (McQueen), and a notable celebrity in the making (Hoffman). It's taken me a long while to get around to this picture and now I'm glad I did. If this is anyone's first look at McQueen, be sure to take note of those incredibly blue eyes of his. They're almost unnatural.",Papillon
7,gavin6942,An Excellent Prison Drama,8,24 September 2012,"A man (Steve McQueen) befriends a fellow criminal (Dustin Hoffman) as the two of them begin serving their sentence on a dreadful prison island, which inspires the man to plot his escape.Many people have had problems with this movie for a variety of reasons, most of which circulate around the exaggerated way the film presents the novel and/or the way the story tends to stretch the truth in the first place. Frankly, when watching the movie, I just ignored this completely... and enjoyed the film for what it is.Dustin Hoffman has always been a great actor, but he is far outdone by McQueen here. I cannot even say I thought much of McQueen in the past, but here -- wow -- he really nails it in the solitary confinement scene. His aging (thanks, makeup department), tattered clothes and loss of mental stability are excellent.",Papillon
8,lee_eisenberg,cinematic butterfly,7,19 June 2006,"Steve McQueen starred in what may have been his last really great movie here. As Devil's Island inmate Henri Charriere, he gets down and dirty throughout the whole movie, and we really see how nasty the prison is. Equally good in the movie is Dustin Hoffman as Charriere's friend Louis Dega, looking about like he did in ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Marathon Man"".The alligator scene is quite shocking, but what the movie portrays overall is supposed to be shocking, what with the hellish prison life. As for the issue of the movie's accuracy, that's always up to debate. The point is to understand how Henri and Louis had to cope with everything. All in all, this isn't the greatest movie ever, but worth seeing.An interesting change of pace from the director of movies as dissimilar as ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""The Boys from Brazil"".",Papillon
9,jboothmillard,Papillon,8,4 May 2011,"From director Franklin J. Schaffner (Planet of the Apes, Patton), I saw this listed in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, and I was corrected on the pronunciation of the title, I was certainly interested. Basically this is the true story of Henri Charrière (Golden Globe nominated Steve McQueen), also known as 'Papillon' (French for ""butterfly"", he has one tattooed on his chest), the wrongfully convicted murderer sentenced to serve life imprisonment in a French penal colony in 'Guiane' (French Guiana, South America) on Devil's Island. While serving time in the hellish, notorious island prison he becomes friends with fellow inmate, counterfeiter Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman), but he plans to escape. Papillon tries a few attempts at escape, but all fail and end up recapture, there is a point when he is put in solitary confinement with little food or drink for seven years and near death. Finally though he manages along with Louis to escape incarceration, but it is a challenge now finding a way off the island, not being able to find a safe boat, being surrounded by guards and tribes people. There is a point when he is shot at and he does manage to get away, and for a while he settles into life with the tribes people, before moving on to find a place to settle with nuns in reclusion for five years. After this time he explores the island further, and he finds Louis alive and well, having settled in his own place, and he decides it is finally time to get off the island itself. He judges the ocean current and waves and when is the best time to jump with flotation and let the current take him away, Louis decides in the end to stay behind, and the end narration said that Papillon did make it to shore to live the rest of his life not in prison. Also starring Victor Jory as Indian Chief, Don Gordon as Julot, Licence to Kill's Anthony Zerbe as Toussaint, Robert Deman as Maturette, Woodrow Parfrey as Clusiot, Bill Mumy as Lariot, George Coulouris as Dr. Chatal, Ratna Assan as Zoraima and William Smithers as Warden Barrot. McQueen gives an enigmatic performance, and Hoffman is splendid when he is on screen, there were points in the story where I might have drifted a little, I mean it is pretty long at just over two hours and forty minutes, but as a harrowing study of confinement and as an escape movie it is quite a highly watchable biographical prison drama. Dustin Hoffman was number 24, and Steve McQueen number 14 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, McQueen was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and McQueen was number 43, and Hoffman number 21 on The World's Greatest Actor. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith. Very good!",Papillon
10,ccthemovieman-1,A Fine Film Which Does The Book Justice,9,18 May 2009,"Usually, after reading a long book filled with many interesting adventures, watching a two-hour film later winds up being a big disappointment. There is no way a film can give you anywhere near the info you glean from a book, especially one over 500 pages as is the case with ""Papillion."" Yet, despite most of Henri Charriere's incredible feats of survival, (""Papillion"" was Charriere's nickname) this movie is above average and basically does the book justice. The movie runs about two-and-a-half hours and gives enough of a flavor to have the viewer appreciate - at least to some degree - the brutal trials and tribulations Papillion went through in real life.If you enjoyed this film, the book is a ""must-read"" for you and very highly-recommend You won't believe all the things Charriere experienced: good and bad. In real life, the man escaped something like eight times and each time went through hell.Steve McQueen, playing ""Papillion,"" was excellent. He was particularly good at showing the physical effects of years of solitary confinement. By the way, in real life, Charriere was much younger went sent to jail than McQueen was at the time this movie was shot. Papillion should have been played by a younger actor, but who's going to complain when you get an actor of McQueen's caliber? Dustin Hoffman also was great as Papillion's friend, ""Louis Dega,"" who had a bigger role in the movie than he did in the book. For the most part, Papillion had a number of friends, all helping him over the years. Hoffman also provided some good comic relief to the movie and, heaven knows, it needed it. Take it from someone who has read the book: this is a grim story, worse than what you saw on screen here.Nevertheless, thanks to the two leading actors and the wonderful work by Director Franklin Schaffner and Cinematograher Fred Koenekamp, this long film entertained. No, it wasn't the caliber of the book, but it's didn't insult it, either, and is definitely worth a look.",Papillon

12,Quinoa1984,"as I'm sure others have said, the 'Other' Great Escape - unsentimental and often harsh",9,29 August 2015,"Papillon is a story of what men will do in a time of crisis, such as being in a rather hellish penal prison colony run by the French on one of their islands. Steve McQueen was probably the only actor that I can think of from the period who could portray this character, at least if this had to be done the Hollywood way (of course the man was French, Henri Carriere, so this goes without saying not counting French actors; perhaps Belmondo could've pulled it off, who knows). But there's so much that happens in his story, spanning many years (seemingly decades, though it's never completely clear), that I kept finding myself thinking 'Ok, oh wow, what happens next?""' It actually isn't entirely a prison movie, it should be noted; the last hour mostly takes place when Papillon, his friend Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman) and another prisoner find a way to get off of the island by boat. But I think the parts of the film I will remember for, well, forever, will be the scenes set in at the prison, and even those early scenes where the filmmaker, Franklin J Schaffner (via writers Trumbo and Semple), simply shows what the situation is: all these men put together, most if not all of them have done something likely prison-worthy, but for this place, this setting, an entire ocean away from their homeland is the thing. Indeed an early scene on the ship that takes the prisoners across the sea, and when Papillon first gets into trouble (one of those middle-of-the-night attack things) is just a small sample of what horrors await him.What Papillon and Dega have done does count, up to a point - these men are a safe-cracker who got a falsely accused murder rap and a counterfeiter respectively - and the actors make them vulnerable and just interesting to watch. So that by the time these men are having to watch all the time to not end up on a s***-list, it gets tense. And yet, it being Papillon as played by Steve frigging McQueen, the star of The Great Escape, we might hope that he has one goal: to get the hell out. But there's no special motorcycle to do a jump over in this case. When this character gets caught, he has to do more time - in solitary - which is around a 15-20 minute chunk in the middle of this film.I should be clear on this point: if you've seen certain scenes set in solitary confinement in other movies, this is one of the most brutal to watch if not just right up there (oddly enough perhaps the other McQueen's film Hunger tops it). We see Papillon stuck in a cell for what feels like a while - and it ends up being two years (!) - and the whole purpose, as he is told by the main prison warden, is to break him from mind to body, from head to toe. And one sees McQueen, giving it his all as an actor, becoming unhinged at a lot of points, eating bugs, having dream-hallucinations of his past in France and with his old friends (and dead fellow prisoners), and it's staggering work. Overall in this film I don't know if I've seen this man give so much for a character; for an actor who was often known for playing quiet, stoic types (and he could do it well), here it's more like hanging it all out. Which, when playing up against someone like Dustin Hoffman, it's a good idea not to be sleepwalking in a role.Papillon puts so many stakes for its characters, and yet what sets it apart from other prison-break-out movies are two things mainly: how bleak and unrelenting the pressure and suspense is, that at any minute everything can very feasibly fall apart (as the writing and direction make clear, this is a painfully realistic world, or a realistically painful one, same thing), and the location. It's beautiful in the jungles and beaches, but a lot of things can kill you (or people, like the lepers). The only real flaw for me is when the movie slows down just at point of the second to third act when Papillon winds up with the natives on the beach. There's no dialog, which is a nice experiment, but it drags the story down: up until then things have been epic in scope, but the pace is fast and it's all down to the story. If anything drags it, it's this unnecessary sequence.But by the ending, and it's really in the last 15/20 minutes that this tale gains some awesome pathos while still being a tough 'guy' movie, you see what this journey has done for these two men. The characters are built up so well enough, and portrayed with enough grit and honesty, that we care every step of the way (Hoffman really sells the nebbishness, but taking it from caricature to realism). Oh, and Jerry Goldsmith's score, which isn't constant but has enough for you to notice it, is a triumph of adventure/action/drama music for a movie of this kind.",Papillon
13,edwagreen,Papillon ***1/2,9,7 September 2013,"Very engaging film of 1973 starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman as two literally condemned prisoners brought to an island by the French government to serve out their lengthy sentences. To say that the French penal system was brutal, that's putting it mildly.This is by far one of the best performances that Steve McQueen ever gave. Didn't Dustin Hoffman's appearance in the film remind you of his memorable Ratso Rizzo in 1969's ""Midnight Cowboy?""The film began to lag somewhat after the duo made it to Honduras. To believe that they were betrayed by that organization is amazing.

14,sunwarrior13,A Prison Drama About The Triumph Of The Human Spirit,10,25 October 2012,"Papillon is a prison film that stars Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Franklin J. Schaffner directs this true story of Henri Charriere,who is better known as ""Papillon"" or ""the butterfly"", a prisoner so determined to escape the notorious Devil's Island, he attempted it multiple times until he reached old age. McQueen plays Charriere and Hoffman is the hero's anxious, defenseless friend. Based on Charriere's own memoir and uncompromisingly adapted by screenwriters Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr.The autobiography of Charriere, one of the few people to successfully escape from the notorious French penal colony of Devil's Island, served as the basis for Papillon. The pugnacious Charriere,who was incarcerated wrongly for he claims for murdering a pimp. He saves the life of fellow convict Louis Dega, a counterfeiter who will later show his gratitude by helping Charriere in his many escape attempts, and by smuggling food to Charriere when the latter is put in solitary confinement. One breakout, which takes Charriere and Dega to a leper colony and then to a native encampment, is almost successful, but Charriere is betrayed and back the prisoners go to French Guiana. Years later, Dega is made a trustee and is content with his lot, but the aging, white-haired Charriere cannot be held back. This is a grim and brutal prison drama, made more likable due to the lead star performances.Steve McQueen's career high performance while Dustin Hoffman doesn't fail to impress the viewers.As the narrative unfolds slowly, but the two stars are compelling and cinematographer Fred Koenekamp's photography is striking.This is definitely a Classic grungy prison drama that has great themes particularly that of the triumph of the human spirit.",Papillon

16,hitchcockthelegend,"Grim and authentic telling of Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière's time at Devil's Island.",9,7 April 2010,"Directed by Franklin J. Schaffner (Planet Of The Apes/Patton), Papillon is adapted for the screen by Dalton Trumbo & Lorenzo Semple Jr. from notorious French felon Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière's own novel. It stars Steve McQueen (Papillon) & Dustin Hoffman (Louis Dega), is primarily shot in Jamaica & Spain with Fred J. Koenekamp (The Towering Inferno) on photography duties and Jerry Goldsmith provides the score.Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière was a crook, a bad egg, he however was sent to the notorious and inescapable prison fortress of Devil's Island for a murder he didn't commit. The film, as is the book, is a fictionalised account of Charrière's time at the penal colony.The film is probably best described as being a stirring drama of friendship under duress, endurance and opportunism, all neatly blended with an adventure based heart. Schaffner directs it with great technical skill, for in a film with minimal dialogue, he manages to perfectly stifle the viewer with a hot sweaty atmosphere. This is crucial for us to feel the confines of this penal colony life. These men are doing hard time, lets not soft soap it Hollywood style, lets get the feel right, something, that much like Don Siegel also did in 79 with his excellent Escape From Alcatraz, Schaffner does exceptionally well. He is helped enormously by two fabulous performances from McQueen & Hoffman.McQueen is in his element as Papillon. Always an actor whose ability for dominating scenes without using histrionic acting was undervalued, Papillon goes some way to readdressing the myth that he was more about iconography than actual talent. His solitary confinement scenes are sublime, and this without saying barely a word. As Papillon staves off starvation, madness and disease, McQueen has such a powerful and believable presence that he pulls us into that five by five paces cell alongside him. Incredible! Once again though the Academy ignored McQueen's excellent work and the film only received just the one Oscar nomination for Goldsmith's pinging tropical score. Hoffman's great work was something of a given, meticulous as usual in his preparation (he had studied for weeks about penal colony life), he is the perfect foil for McQueen and the relationship between them is tender yet never twee. Fine support also comes from Anthony Zerbe as a compassionate leader of a leper colony & Victor Jory as an Indian Chief.The production was an expensive one, with the original budget of $4 million ballooning to $14 million, making it the most expensive film of 1973. A couple of scripts were jettisoned (money down the drain) before Schaffner enlisted Trumbo to write the screenplay. A good move because Trumbo was able to flesh out character relationships that didn't exist in the source novel. Hoffman himself was adamant that he would only play Dega if the film steered away from a buddy buddy formula and gave Dega intelligent integrity. He got it, which is credit to Trumbo since the Dega character is barely formed in the novel, in fact the film version is an amalgamation of several penal colony characters. Trumbo was rewarded with not only a considerable paycheck, but also a bit part in the movie as the colony commandant early in the piece.Initial critical reaction to the film was harsh, but the public didn't agree since the theatres were packed and the film made almost $50 million Worldwide. This made it Allied Artists most successful film ever. It has since garnered a massive fan base and has been favourably reassessed by a new wave of critics. Those old complaints about it being too sombre and too enduring to get through just don't add up. One only has to note the thematics and essence of the story to know that this is indeed fact. 9/10",Papillon
17,Theo Robertson,Good Story ....,6,4 July 2002,"..... But that`s all it is , a story . Having watched several documentries on Devil`s Island there is some debate on weather Henri Charriere had even been an inmate at the penal colony , or if the claimed incidents happened but they all agree on one thing - none of these incidents actually happened to Charriere , other inmates maybe but not to Charrire .
Watching PAPILLON the film ( I`ve never read the novel ...sorry book ) it just doesn`t ring true ****** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****** on arrival the inmates are warned about madame guillotine but several times in the film Charriere violently attacks guards and Louis Dega is seen to hit a guard over the head possibly killing him , and these two trouble makers survive captivity and recapture without getting their heads cut off ! Also unlikely is the scene where Charriere and Dega`s fellow escapee dies in a very dramatic way - just as Chairrere comes out of a hellhole after spending five years in solitary confinement. How very very convenient to have such a dramatic moment at that particular time ,  and one of Dega`s victims just happens to work in the reception area of the prison leading to some difficult work detail for him and Charriere , man astronomical bad luck just isn`t the word.  Oh and where`s the depiction of "" The terrible promiscuity "" that History Channel documentaries refer to on Devil`s Island ?Controversy as to the veracity of Charriere`s book aside PAPILLON is still a rather average film despite its epic qualities , the script is very episodic and disjointed , McQueen gives a brooding performance which isn`t exactly bad but neither is it memorable. Hoffman is good as Dega but I can no longer take him seriously because he looks exactly like Adam Clayton the bass player from U2 ! I`m being serious here , watch PAPILLON and look at a photo of U2 post JOSHUA TREE  to see what I mean",Papillon
18,Doylenf,Unflinching look at brutal penal colony...gripping but exhausting...,7,25 May 2005,"Brutal treatment in a penal colony has been explored on the screen before in such earlier films as I WAS A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG, but never has there been a more graphic expose of the sort of conditions prisoners faced under the worst sort of environment.At times the film is extremely harrowing to watch, and at other times the story tends to drag a little. But there can be no doubt that STEVE McQUEEN and DUSTIN Hoffman create believable and sympathetic (yet quirky) characterizations and do some of the finest acting of their careers. Their roles are physically demanding and always played with total conviction.Not for the squeamish, but extremely well acted by the entire cast, great location photography and a nice background score by Jerry Goldsmith. The first half of the story is much more compelling than what happens in the final years and the last half-hour of the film is a bit sluggish in pacing. But overall, a memorable escape film that ranks with the best of other escape stories.My first viewing of the film years ago made an indelible impression on me, but I must confess that later viewings convinced me that it is not exactly flawless in that the pacing is sometimes much too slow and the ending is somewhat unsatisfying.",Papillon

20,CinemaSerf,Never trust a nun!,7,6 August 2020,"Steve McQueen is superb as unlucky safe-cracker Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière, an innocent man convicted of murder and sentenced to imprisonment in the French penal colony at French Guiana. Once there, he learns quickly to appreciate the sheer brutality of a prison where any semblance of decency and humanity has been long abandoned. He allies himself with ""Dega"" (Dustin Hoffman), the rather wealthy, calculating, forger who fully expects his release papers to arrive any day! McQueen agrees to keep an eye on Hoffman meantime, in return for enough funds to enable him to try to escape too. Over the course of their incarceration, they become unlikely friends combatting the harsh, at times lethal, prison regime and trying to keep safe from their equally savage colleagues - each with an axe, of some sort, to grind. I'm not Hoffman's biggest fan, he tends to mimic rather than act - but I'd say that this is McQueen's finest, grittiest, performance - and the sense of pain, deprivation and hope he elicits are captivating to watch. There are some pictures at the end of the facility as it looked in the early 1970s - evocative of just how cruel these places were.",Papillon

22,neil-476,First rate on all levels,10,23 May 2009,"I watched Papillon last night after a gap of many years. Having watched Angels And Demons at the cinema earlier in the week, I felt compelled to compare the two, since both are well over two hours of blockbuster movie, based on best-selling books (which they do not so much translate to the screen as adapt), featuring well respected actors at the top of their game.But there the comparison comes to an end. For where Angels and Demons is big and brash, full of sound and fury signifying nothing (as Mr S might say), Papillon by contrast, notwithstanding its action sequences, is a film full of subtlety and subtext.Head and shoulders above everything is the relationship between Papillon (Steve McQueen) and Louis Degas (Dustin Hoffman). Born out of expediency - Papillon needs Degas' access to money to fund his escape attempts, Degas needs Papillon's physicality for protection - the relationship between the two men ultimately far transcends pragmatism, with each making significant personal sacrifices for the welfare of the other. In the closing minutes of the film, the two men embrace, and this gesture - full of awkwardness and love - is part of perfect performances by the two principals of this movie.Both actors play to their strengths, yet go well beyond the obvious. McQueen's action man persona is clearly well suited to Papillon, the perennial escape artist, but he is given long stretches in which to portray the physical and mental deterioration and debilitation arising from years in solitary confinement. Hoffman had already raised his own bar with performances in The Graduate and Midnight Cowboy, but Degas is rather more than a downtrodden underdog: he has a nobility of his own, and Hoffman's portrayal takes him from scared nerd to reluctant hero to squirrelly and nearly beaten.The other performers, well known and less so, are all also excellent.The film possibly suffers from being a touch episodic, but I suspect that is an inevitable result of having to abridge the source material. The power of the original narrative, and the deprivations suffered by prisoners (and the strength og character needed in order to survive) are preserved intact, and celebrated.I suggest it is worth watching Angels And Demons to see an empty headed blockbuster, followed by Papillon, to see a blockbuster which also contains a great deal of food for thought.",Papillon

The character played by Dustin Hoffman was a fictional one created for the film in the attempt to turn it into a buddy movie, and much as I like Hoffman as an actor, it's obvious that he was shoehorned into the screenplay. He drops out for large portions altogether, and the movie isn't much different for it. Also, McQueen and Hoffman didn't get along on set, and it shows in the lack of chemistry they have on screen.Otherwise, this is a pretty gripping film that perhaps goes on a little too long but never overstays its welcome.Jerry Goldsmith received an Oscar nomination for the film's score.Grade: A-",Papillon

It does go on longer than necessary, but it remains gripping most of the time; the solitary-confinement segment is particularly compelling. Director Franklin Schaffner is not just a solid storyteller, he has some visual ideas as well (the second hallucination offers the single most unforgettable image in the film, IMO).

You get to watch as he tries to find a way to escape this island and once again live the life of a free man. Steve McQueen is great in the title role as Papillion as is Dustin Hoffmon as Dega a person whom Papillion becomes friends with even before the two reach the island and get sent to a horrid little area of the island thanks to some unsound advice Hoffmon's character gave a guard's wife or something. There is humor in this one as I enjoyed the scene with the alligator, and there is some action as some of the escape attempts had a lot to them. There is also some good drama as there interplay between the characters is very good. I especially enjoyed the scenes involving Papillion being sent to the solitary confinement section of the prison and his time there in the dark and going crazy. One problem with the film though is that I never really know how much time has passed during the course of the movie. However, this could be on purpose as when one is in prison and secluded one does tend to not realize how much time has passed in the real world. The ending is all right, but after all the other escape attempts that were so elaborate the one that actually succeeded seemed rather simple. Still, the cast is solid and the story entertaining enough to really get you involved emotionally with the film and its characters.",Papillon

The film takes us through various tense and exciting moments despite some longueurs along the way, before arriving at the satisfying conclusion in the last scenes of the film.As indicated earlier, McQueen leads a good cast who support him well, but it's ultimately his film and his acting thankfully affirms it.

29,ElMaruecan82,"The Man with the ""Butterfly"" Tattoo ...",8,17 April 2013,"Should I or should I not review ""Papillon""?This question has been puzzling my mind for several months. And now, I understand that whatever I'm going to write, the relevance will be undermined by the fact that I didn't read the novel. In advance, I apologize for the following intellectual masturbation.Is an adaptation supposed to be a complement of the original book, or it should be regarded as a totally independent medium? Since I've seen more films than I read books, the most convenient choice is to believe in the second option. However, one of the first things I remember about the film was my father's experience, it was the first novel he read that was adapted into a film, and as much as he admired Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, he thought the film was an insult to the book. And guess what? Many IMDb users share the same feelings, and insist that the film doesn't respect the film's narrative, and even worse, fails to vehicle the same gripping emotions, than Henri Charrière's biographical best-seller. With that in mind, I knew my appreciation would be biased, and although it didn't ruin my desire to enjoy the film, I often find myself wondering how extraordinary the reading of some paragraphs would have been. Indeed, the more I recreate in my mind, the famous 'isolation' sequence, where I remember the agonizing white-haired face of an exhausted Steve McQueen, forced to eat cockroaches and his own excrement, reaching for the thinnest light of hope as the only tunnel to existence, I know I'm missing one hell of a literary experience. I know the book would be a thrilling psychological study, inviting us to identify with a man who could only hang on his desire to escape, not to die in starvation or insanity. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" succeeded with less potential, here, even in the middle of a jungle, where the isolation is accentuated, the film is more about the escape than the human motives beneath them.Still, in that very part, McQueen's performance as the man with the ""Butterfly"" tattoo, did probably justice to the novel, as I've never felt so intensely absorbed by the pain endured by a prisoner. And the isolation part plays as a microcosm to what makes ""Papillon"" one hell of an exhaustive experience, in both the right and the wrong way.The problem is that the film is almost three-hour long, and quite irregular quality-wise, it's not the kind of prison film where each scene works alone as a classic or gets stuck in your mind, I wish it was. In its attempt to be faithful to the experience lived by Charriere, (even the fictional parts), the film covers a bit too much, victim of its own ambition. Roger Ebert's criticism sums it up quite well, when he regrets that the film spent too much time developing the friendship between Charriere and Dega (the geeky counterfeit played by Dustin Hoffman) as if Dega was significant enough to the story. Granted it's hard to picture Dustin Hoffman playing a minor role in the 70's, and since he's the one who hired Charriere as a bodyguard, and cost him his isolation by supplying him some food, he became an important element of the story. Still, between the hellish life and mental torture of a prisoner in the famous Devil's Island prison and a friendship story, the film tries to oscillates, with a clumsy editing and a result far from the developed relationship between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in ""Shawshank"".The result is therefore uneven: we're grabbed by the story, the setting is realistic enough to hook us immediately to the prisoner's experience, and its exoticness conveys a thrilling sense of danger that makes even the escape a debatable option. But there comes a moment at the end, where all we wait for is the nightmare to stop. As said Ebert (I'm still saddened by his recent passing, so it's only fitting to quote him) we don't want the prisoners to escape for their own freedom but just so the film could be over. And I don't even detect sarcasm in this remark, for even the best-looking and best-acted films can reach a no-return point in the viewer's attention span. ""Papillon"", after nineteen intense minutes, turns out to a series of misfortunes, so repetitive they are tragicomically frustrating, from a well-crafted escape that end up in a unseaworthy boat, from a long trip in a indigenous tribe's camp to the capture by South-American soldiers, to the providential help of a nun that leads him to another arrest, we start to wonder when the hell is going to get off that one, and this is a selfish feeling too.And another sad consequence is that no matter how great Steve McQueen is, there are five minutes that are totally unwatchable: when they discover that they can't take the boat, McQueen's acting is inversely proportional to the wonderful scene where he has a nervous breakdown and can't tell the guards who gave him the food. To those who wonder why he didn't get the Oscar, maybe that scene cost him the award. I still give the film an 8, because I enjoyed it, and still regard the isolation part as some of the best movie scenes from any other prison movie. But I know that sooner or later, I will read the book, and my opinion might be more severe. Is ""Papillon"" one of the best movies of the 70's, one of the most memorable, yes, the highlight of Steve McQueen's career, probably. An unforgettable experience? At some parts, yes. But a masterpiece, it isn't  and God knows it had the potential to be one.",Papillon
30,MOscarbradley,Surprisingly effective,7,25 September 2005,"Many people love this movie and think it a great adventure, and for a Franklin J Schaffner film it isn't half-bad, (it has great visual sweep and he certainly makes the most of the locations). It is based on the true story of Henri Charriere who escaped from Devil's Island, but like all 'true stories' you wonder at how much the film-makers, and indeed the man himself, who chronicled the escape in a book, fabricated events. It's really just one escape after another until he finally gets away, but the escapes are exciting in a literal, very widescreen kind of way and even though you know the ending, Schaffner still manages to crank up the suspense.Steve McQueen is Charriere, ('Papillion'), and he's got a haunted, ferrety look about him; he has the needling determination of a survivor. Dustin Hoffman is the wormy little forger who becomes his friend. They are well-matched. There is a touch of 'Ratso' Rizzo about Hoffman's performance. He hadn't been in movies long and had yet to broaden his range. It's a long movie (two and a half hours) and there isn't anyone else to root for, and though the guards, and some of the other prisoners, are sadistic, the film is surprisingly short of villains.",Papillon
31,ThomasDrufke,Surprisingly Dark Tale Filled With Heart,9,2 October 2014,"Steve McQueen is a legend. He gives, in my opinion, one of the all-time great performances in Papillon and he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar. Paired with Dustin Hoffman they create wonderful chemistry together and give the film the heart it needed. Although not as memorable as The Great Escape, it's by far more daring and complex.Papillon (McQueen) and Dega (Hoffman) are supposedly wrongfully convicted inmates at the infamous Devil's Island. McQueen, just like in The Great Escape, is desperate to escape. While Dega is convinced his wife will one day pay her way to releasing him. You don't get to spend enough time with them in the cells as I would have liked. I believe in the relationship but it seems like they escape within the first hour of a 150 minute film. Similar to The Great Escape, this film lacks a defining villain. Our heroes are only as good as the villains. But it's such a wonderful ride with these characters that I can forget the few mistakes it has and appreciate the masterpiece of a film it is.I was a bit taken out of the film for about ten minutes when Papillon finds himself on an island with a community of people. I didn't think it fit with the rest of the film. With that being said, the actual ending of the film is definitely worth your time. I was getting worried as to the final direction it was going but props to Hoffman and McQueen for delivering. With all the pain and suffering these characters go through it's a very satisfying conclusion to their journey.In all, McQueen gives his best performance and Hoffman perfectly compliments him in what is one of the greatest escape films of all time.+McQueen gives legendary performance +Unbelievable story +Truly care about the leads +Ending pays off -Out of place Island scene 9.4/10",Papillon
32,atlasmb,"A Stark Depiction of Captivity, Mostly True",8,11 February 2016,"I saw ""Papillon"" on its initial release in 1973 and I found on rewatching recently that I had forgotten most of it. I am not sure what that says about the film, but after decades I was only left with the general impression that a prisoner's life on Devil's Island was horrible.The story is true to some degree. Whatever its authenticity, the film is impressive in its depiction of a horrible reality--for Devil's Island did exist. And it is a filmic testament to the human spirit and its desire for freedom. Much of the credit goes to Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman, who played the two leads. If one is measuring McQueen's acting ability, it might be wise to start with his portrayal of the titular Papillon. Hoffman, on the other hand, has many other tours de force to his credit.Among the canon of prison films, ""Papillon"" is certainly first rate. Personally, I prefer ""Cool Hand Luke"" or ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", but ""Papillon"" presents a stark captivity with little dialogue, relying on the camera's close investigation of the minutiae of daily existence as reflected in the prisoners' faces and their bearing. Did McQueen or Hoffman deserve the Oscar for Best Actor? They might have split the vote if both were nominated, but each probably deserved a nomination.",Papillon

Because of its episodic nature, the film moves in fits and starts, making it difficult to become immersed in the story. The best part is the escape sequence in the middle.

35,redryan64,Grand Styled. Even Epic Telling Of Prison and the Human Spirit! No Light Escapism Here!!,10,12 January 2007,"The Prison Picture is one Genre that has always generated a lot of interest with the movie going public. We can go far back into the silent days through the Gaqngster/Prohibition Era and find so many examples of movies that are still and always will be viewed over and over, generation to generation. Titles Like THE BIG HOUSE, 20,000 YEARS IN SING SING, and EACH DAWN I DIE are among the films that would easily come to mind among the truly 'classic' movies out there. Even comedy teams would usually have a title or two that spoofed the Prison Picture. Laurel & Hardy contributed a 2 Reel Short,THE HOOSEGOW and a feature, PARDON US , which definitely parodied THE BIG HOUSE.Let's fast forward to the 1970's which had a lot of movies with Black Themes. True to the previous trends, there were a good number of Prison Pictures in the mix. The two films that come to mind immediately are TERMINAL ISLAND, and SOUNDER*. But the very best, grandest, greatest productions of this Era is Franklin J. Schafner's PAPILLON.Based on the autobiographical novel by the same name (Papillon is French for butterfly, and the nickname of the protagonist of the story, who had a butterfly tattoo on his chest.) The story, as in the real life occurrence, is set in France and in the French Guiana Penal Colony-including infamous Devil's Island.The film runs very long, and was cut to its present running time only days before its general release, around the Christmas Season in 1973. The cast was headed up by Co-Stars, Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. If there were ever a pair of lead actors who were truly opposites, truly different in all respects, it was these two. Though both were stage trained, that was as far as similarities go. Steve McQueen had become a sort of action star, though a very eloquent one. Dustin Hoffman on the other hand had made it a career up this point by portraying the clever type, who always uses his brain to navigate the tough waters in life.Together, they make a truly fine twosome,each offsetting the other guy's weakness, with their own strengths.The verbal and action interplay through out make the story both believable and satisfying to the senses, including the sense of humor.Director, Franklin J.Schaffner, came to doing theatrical movies after finding success in direction on live television. His previous two credits were both big pictures. NICHOLAS and ALEXANDRA, and PATTON, were permanent proof of the talent of Mr. Schaffner, as both were critically acclaimed and successful at the box office, particularly PATTON Mr. Schaffner does not pull any punches, characterizing the prison as what the prisons are, just a cesspool of corruption; a closed society run not by the administration or the Guards, but rather by the inmates, themselves. They then and now, inmates are bothered by the local homosexuals. The Director doesn't gloss over this fact, but we aren't over exposed to it, either.It should be mentioned that Schaffner and company made the decision early on that probably was a great contributor to the success of the film. That is, namely there is no attempt to affect any French accents. Other than an occasional 'Monsouer' from a prison guard, there is only English, American style.The Original Music, theme and incidental, was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, who has been responsible for so many other scores, including PATTON and RUDY. he music is varied in mood from somber and tragic to distressed and finally triumphant.The location shooting in South Anerica and in a Spanish town (doubling for a French city) make some of the most beautiful color film that we can remember. This is good, because like so many other great films, it is a sort of a downer, and one should be in the mood for this type of fare.On a personal note, I can't remember just how many times I viewed PAPILLON. You see at the time of its release, I was a Chicago Policeman and was employed as part time extra employment working security at the State-Lake Theatre, 190 N. State St., in Downtown Chicago. Remember, no one sees the pictures more than the Cops! This was a release of the Allied Artists Pictures Corporation which brings a rather absurd notion to my head, but I'll share it anyway. Allied Artists had been formerly known as Monogram Pictures, home to the Bowery Boys series. One can only wonder, if it had been made 20 years earlier, would it have co-starred Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall?* Perhaps you would disagree with my classifying SOUNDER as a prison picture, and it,strictly speaking, probably isn't. However, prison plays such a big part in the story, that it's worth a mention.",Papillon

38,SAMTHEBESTEST,Indeed The Greatest Adventure of Escape with Great Performances by McQueen and Hoffman.,7,12 October 2020,"Papillon (1973) :
Movie Review -Indeed The Greatest Adventure of Escape with Great Performances by McQueen and Hoffman. Among all the escape films I saw made before 70s there are some universal classics like 'Stalag 17' and 'The Great Escape' which have impressed me a lot in every sense. After those films i came to know about this less known escape adventure drama and deliberately tried to compare it with those 2 Classics but still it was something really different. Papillon is a catchy title so I really thought about some fun before opening the seal but it wasn't, yet somehow I found this long ride engaging. The film is about Papillon, a wrongly Convicted murderer trying to escape from the Penal System of France meets another fellow convicted in the prison. These 2 plan an unbelievable escape which expectedly involves other characters and several disasters. By the end how far he goes after so much struggle and crossing many barriers are the things to watch out for. Steve McQueen in the lead role is the greatest part of this narrative. His passion, dedication can be felt, his looks speak, his attitude louds, his dialogues shiver you and what not. Perhaps the best performance of his career for which only i can give a 2nd watch to this film. On the other side someone who never disappoints even if it's a smaller role, Mr. Dustin Hoffman at his initial best form. The set decoration suits the era and Cinematography is fine. What goes wrong with film? then it's runtime maybe otherwise its nice and neat. Franklin Schaffner in the director's chair commands this adventure escape ride steadily. In a nutshell, Papillon is fulfilling Adventurous tale in all realistic world and people, rather it is more exciting than other so called fictional adventure genre films. Sadly, it came after acclaimed classics otherwise would have got enough recognition by movie buffs.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",Papillon

He tells them they are hereafter objects, property, luggage. It sets up the expanse and atmosphere for a stimulating spectacle of fortitude, pioneering and besieged camaraderie. It's a very classically made adventure movie. We're always caught up in the physical expanse of the story. Director Franklin J. Schaffner doubled between personal dramas and grand-scale epics, and Papillon was one of the gargantuan Oscar-effort productions that confirmed him on the A-list, along with Patton and Nicholas and Alexandra.Though many spectacular shots in Papillon aren't practically vital and though they give you the sense that the film was shot predominantly from a zeppelin, they bring to mind an all but outmoded storytelling technique to which we're all a little biased, the sort that looks to substantiate character and event by telling us a large amount more about topography, environment, climate conditions, plant life and architecture than we categorically need know. Likewise, its puffy running time emphasizes the captive feeling of the characters languishing in time. The metric nature of the cutting is protracted, using the usually massive visual composition of the shots to extend the physical nature of time rather than eliciting the most basal and emotional reactions in the audience with a fast pace. It elicits those reactions from us with the desperation of the prison environment itself.The movie analogy to the novel's descriptive paragraph is the long shot. It fills the screen with elements and data intended to persuade us that since the setting is authentic, so must be the people in it. Papillon frantically needs this kind of scaffolding since the Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr. screenplay, apparently like the book, identifies its characters less by what they feel or think than overstated events and Herculean feats. I can understand the view that Papillon is dry in the sense that a Victorian costume drama is. We understand the dilemmas of the characters right off, because they're in a strait-jacket environment where they always have to watch their step, much less express how they truly feel in ways other than what's not considered downright subversive. But Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Howards End and Gosford Park tell their stories in the same manner as this prison struggle. And it's effective on just the same level.Steve McQueen was not just another action hero. He was like Clint Eastwood, a master of masculine understatement. And Dustin Hoffman, who plays a refined counterfeiter, a white-collar criminal whose guilt is without doubt, does outstanding work portraying his character's adjustment to the demoralization of prison life. There are various and sundry peripheral characters in the story, all essentially requisite for a Devil's Island adventure: the sadistic guard, the condemned prisoner, the idealistic doctor. The atrocities of prison life are explicitly exposed, including a decapitation that concludes in blood gushing onto the lens of the camera, cockroaches eaten to improve the prison intake, storms at sea and a hand-to-hand confrontation with a crocodile.",Papillon
42,thinker1691,""" How did you know I had dry leprosy? . . . . I didn't""",10,29 October 2008,"Henri 'Papillon' Charriere, was a lifetime inmate under the French government's harsh penal system in French Guiana. In his declining years he wrote his memoirs describing his years of incarceration, his cruel mistreatment and daring, multiple escapes. Weather or not he was the actual character of his own book, is disputed to this day. But the fact that he was an inmate is true enough and fits in with the actual site which came to be known as 'Devil's Island.' Court records indicate that Henri Charriere (Steve McQueen) later called "" Papillon "" which is french for Butterfly, was indeed a minor burglar and safe cracker. His claim he was innocent of murder, may be true enough, due to an unreliable source accusing him in court, yet producing little supporting evidence. Nevertheless, the infamous thief was given a twenty year sentence, which was extended due to his numerous escapes. During his imprisonment, he becomes lifelong friends with an equally famous treasury forger named Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman). Don Gordon (a real life friend of McQueen) plays Julot, an experienced prisoner with his own intentions of escape. Anthony Zerbe is hideously interesting as Toussaint, a ravaged leper, who aids escaping prisoners. The entire film is one remarkable story and becomes an incredible journey, one which transcends the screen and offers audiences, the raw reality of life under the most severe and brutal penal systems in the world. The infamous 'Devil's Island ' today has become synonymous with a hellish place of unspeakable conditions. A fantastic movie for those in search of true-life Classic. ****",Papillon
43,ackstasis,"""Make the best of what we offer you, and you will suffer less than you deserve.""",8,25 October 2007,"'Papillon' tells one of those stories that we remember for a long time. It is the tale of one man's life, an unbreakable friendship, and an inability to accept defeat against impossible odds. The film was based on the memoirs of convicted French felon Henri Charrière (though several critics have expressed doubt over the factual accuracy of the described events), who spent many years incarcerated in the brutal penal settlement of mainland French Guiana. The film was adapted by Dalton Trumbo and Lorenzo Semple Jr., and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, who is most well-known for 'The Planet of the Apes (1968)' and 'Patton (1970).' Steve McQueen delivers a formidable performance as the convict Charriere, nicknamed ""Papillon"" because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest. Claiming to have been framed in the murder of a pimp, Papillon seeks immediately to escape from his imprisonment, employing the services  and later the friendship  of the withdrawn and vulnerable, but nonetheless resourceful, Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman).One element that 'Papillon' accomplishes so powerfully is the torture and suffering that takes place in the prison. The bodies of exhausted and wasted men litter the paths, and most inmates have grown so accustomed to the prospect of death that they greet each carcass with a painful indifference. After a failed escape attempt, Papillon is sentenced to two years in solitary confinement, a truly horrific punishment with the sole aim of crushing the prisoner's spirit and sanity. Despite a few inexperienced dream sequences, this segment of the film is handled masterfully, and McQueen excels, deteriorating into the jittery, wide-eyed, physically-drained shell of a human being who has only a paper-thin grasp on both life and reality. A remarkable thing about Dustin Hoffman is that I've never seen him play the same character, and Louis Dega is no exception. Beneath his thick-lensed spectacles and shy countenance lies a true friend; one who, despite their differences, will risk everything to repay a good deed once done.During the last third of 'Papillon', not including the final act, Schaffner veers slightly away from the touching human friendship story and descends into above-average adventure mode, which was interesting but not on par with the rest of the film. Though it appeared in Charrière's original novel, the ill-developed (and dialogue-sparse) sub-plot of the brave white man earning the admiration of the natives was a Hollywood cliché that I could have done without. Additionally, a wonderful ending was tarnished somewhat by an unnecessary few lines of closing narration. It would have been much more effective had Papillon's fate been left open to the audiences. Of course, the fact that the writers were working off a true story perhaps makes that idea completely redundant. Nevertheless, 'Papillon' is a magnificently memorable prison drama, with two outstanding central performances (neither of which, I was shocked to discover, were nominated for an Oscar). The film's themes  of an innocent man finding the courage, hope and friendship to survive the horrific treatment of a cruel prison system  almost certainly served as inspiration for Frank Darabont's 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994).'",Papillon
44,robfollower,"They called him Papillon, meaning butterfly.",9,19 July 2019,"They called him Papillon, meaning butterfly. If only he had wings to go with the name. Unable to fly, Henri Charriere virtually willed himself free. He persisted until he did the impossible: escape Devil's Island. Based on Charriere's bestseller and shot in Spain and Jamaica, Franklin J. Schaffner's film of Papillon united two stars at key career junctures. After a decade of fine work in The Great Escape, The Sand Pebbles and Bullitt, Steve McQueen found in Charriere another ideal tough-guy role. Coming off The Graduate, Midnight Cowboy and Little Big Man, Dustin Hoffman again distinguished himself as Dega, Charriere's scruffy friend.",Papillon
45,jimbo-53-186511,"Pretty good all round, but way too long....",6,21 June 2015,"Henri 'Papillion' Charriere (Steve McQueen) is given a life sentence for killing a pimp and is to serve his sentence at a penal colony in French Guyana. Whilst he's serving his time, he befriends master forger Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman). At first, the two men merely share a friendship of 'convenience' - Papillon offers to protect Dega from other prisoners who are trying to get his money and in return Dega promises to finance Papillon's escape once he gets to the penal colony. However, as time passes a much stronger bond begins to develop between the two men and they both decide to try to escape together.The first thing I'd like to address with this film is its running time and at close to 150 minutes it's a very long film and the problem is that it actually feels like a long film. The first half of the film is particularly long and drawn out and I couldn't help but feel that the film was badly in need of being edited a bit.Despite the above gripe the film is still engaging and at times it's very moving. As mentioned, Dega and Papillon's friendship was one of convenience at the start, but as the years pass by a strong bond began to exits between the men and each respective stage of this friendship is brought to life beautifully between Hoffman and McQueen.For me, the best part of the film was McQueen's first stint in solitary confinement. Here screenwriters Trumbo & Semple Jr really highlight how 2 years in solitary confinement can cause a gradual deterioration of the mind - the dream sequences and hallucinations really help to get into Papillon's mind-set and see what he's thinking. McQueen's performance really helps as well and when watching him here I really cared for his character and felt his pain... In truth at times I forgot that I was actually watching Steve McQueen as I've always felt that he's a bit of a mediocre actor (he was particularly wooden in Bullitt), but I was genuinely surprised how good he was here. The only slight downside with this aspect of the film is that I got no feeling that Papillon had been on half rations for 6 months; it probably would have been more convincing if McQueen had gone 'method' and lost some weight during production, but I realise that this is an actor's choice and it's possible that they may have had a tight scheduling limit. It's only a minor criticism and as I said McQueen was excellent here and throughout the film. Hoffman was good as well, but I already knew that he was a good actor, but McQueen was the real revelation here.Although this is a serious portrayal of man's desire to escape from prison the film does have some light hearted moments such as the scene where Papillon and Dega are trying to capture the crocodile - that bit was very funny. The film is also emotionally involving particularly towards the end - I got the impression that Dega didn't go with Papillon because he'd become somewhat institutionalised and perhaps saw Devil's island as his home. The fact that his wife left him as well may have also made him feel that he had no real reason to leave. That's just my assumption.Papillon is a good film, but it does drag at times and is far too long. As far as Prison escape films go then this is inferior to the likes of Shawshank Redemption, Escape from Alcatraz & The Great Escape. However, if you're a fan of those films then you should find plenty to enjoy here too.",Papillon

Papillon is seen pursued by Indian trustees, and harassed by brutal guards... The power of the movie lies on Papillon's triumph over oppression, his continual perseverance, humanity, honesty, his quiet dignity, and sheer spirit...Guided this time by one of the most creative directors who offered handsomely 'Planet of the Apes' and 'Patton,' Steve McQueenas Papillon exhibits a raw vitality, a complete spectrum of emotions, and a sure command of his technical acting-resources that are breathtaking in their impact..Dustin Hoffmanin perfect rapport with his role, perceptively invading its every nuance and implication portrays a quality of character exhibited in the face of impossible adversity... His last scene with McQueen attempting to convince his friend not to leave the island, represents one of the film's most moving, and effective sequence...Schaffner gives a stirring picture of forsaken men, and takes up the challenge and proceeding to 'beat the system' against incalculable odds...

47,dwpollar,Convoluted escape movie...,3,16 February 2014,"1st watched 2/15/2014 -- 3 out of 10(Dir-Franklin J. Schaffner): Convoluted escape movie giving the star Steve McQueen one of the most complex roles which he does OK with, but Director Franklin J. Schaffner really never comes across like he was clear on how he wanted the movie to come across. Advertised as an action prison escape movie with star power of McQueen and Dustin Hoffman and based on a well received novel, but this epic attempt of telling the story has no real pull on the viewer to care about the outcome unless you just can't wait to see the inevitable after it's forecasted by a prisoner near the beginning that Papillon will never return home to France, and a scene where it's emphasized that the prison is in-escapable(aka. maybe expect the opposite to occur??). Papillon was accused of the murder of a pimp(which he denies), and is transported to a brutal French Guiana prison shown in the initial scene in a strange triumphal departure from the country while the French look on. It's obvious that very early on Papillon intends to attempt to escape and he knows that Hoffman's character, Daego, has a lot of money at his disposal so introduces himself and intends to use this method to make things happen. Initially Daego doesn't want to go with him, but will provide the funds if he's safely delivered to the prison. The movie is really about the friendship that eventually happens between these two characters because of each one's self sacrifice for the other, but the Director never promotes this idea to his detriment. The rest of the movie is plodding chronicle that never seems to want to end despite Hoffman and McQueens watchable performances even though the characters lack depth and development, and sometimes change from scene to scene. I'm sure the book wasn't this un-focused or it wouldn't have been so popular -- but I think the movie was popular -- so who's to know. Sadly, this is probably McQueen's finest character and performance as an actor but it's spoiled by this long winded movie about very little except portraying one man's determination against overwhelming odds.",Papillon

51,slokes,Steven's Back In Jail Again,5,6 November 2008,"Right after making ""The Getaway"", Steve McQueen was back doing even harder time on Devil's Island as the title character in ""Papillon"", a French mec convicted of a murder of which he swears he is innocent, who refuses to abandon his hopes for freedom, no matter the cost.It's a great role in an occasionally affecting, often frustrating film that forces us to spend time in solitary confinement and hard labor, taking abuse from guards and making friends among fellow inmates, in particular the fastidious counterfeiter Dega played by Dustin Hoffman who, like McQueen, was enjoying the peak of a richly-earned stardom. It's a kind of buddy film, though McQueen spends much of his screen time alone. Seeing him grit his moldering teeth at the sun, yelling defiance and eating bugs, is to see a man in desperate circumstances, winning our respect by never giving up.It's not the escape itself, but not accepting his imprisoned condition, that drives Papillon on.""You think it will work?"" Dega asks him about yet another escape plan.""Does it matter?"" is Papillon's reply.A lot in ""Papillon"" doesn't work. Director Franklin J. Schaffner creates some grand spectacles, but also pushes for too much effect. A minute after landing, one of Papillon's fellow prisoners makes a break for the water so we can see him shot in the head, right after another maims himself in order to die horribly later on. There are overwrought dream sequences, such as one where Papillon imagines himself accused of leading ""a wasted life"", and an abusive trusty who wears eyeliner so we get the point he's supposed to be all menacing and gay.Then there's the problem of compressing the source text, Henri Charriere's autobiography-cum-fantasy. ""Papillon"" the book's a great read, equal parts folk stories and prison-yard blarney, but in trying to capture the decades-long storyline, we get a lot of incidents that just sort of happen with no set-ups or apparent reason.In the book, Papillon (Charriere's nickname means ""butterfly"" in French, he wears a tattoo of one on his chest) is continuously befriended by strange people - lepers, cannibals, native tribespeople, even a prison warden - suggesting a sort of rogue hopefulness regarding the human condition. Here, there's no time for scene-setting, so Papillon just oddly latches on to assorted people for a couple of minutes here and there, while attempting another escape. The film runs two-and-a-half hours, but too much of its running time is either this mad montage stuff or else Papillon and his comrades standing around. As an adventure movie, it's mighty slow.But it is beautiful to look at, with swirling palms and azure seas courtesy of Fred Koenekamp, who also shot Schaffner's ""Patton"". There's a great supporting cast of familiar faces of the time playing the various cogs in Papillon's misspent life, like the preacher from ""Blazing Saddles"", the ship executive from ""Poseidon Adventure"", Orson Welles' guardian from ""Citizen Kane"", and the nun from my sixth-grade science class. Woodrow Parfrey is not one I remember seeing before, but his turn as the ill-fated inmate Clusoit is a real standout.You also get a terrific supporting turn from Hoffman, working his usual tics in new and interesting ways (he thinks he doesn't need to escape because his wife will spend all the money he hid with her to rescue him, poor sap). Even better is McQueen, shedding his ""King of Cool"" image as he hobbles around, hair white from exhaustion, half-crazy but still bent on his escape.""Me they can kill"", he tells Dega, when Dega tries to talk him out of one more crazy plan. ""You they own.""I understand how McQueen fans celebrate ""Papillon"", and think it unfairly overlooked. I just don't agree. It's a fantastic McQueen turn, but like his later ""Tom Horn"", one mired in a lesser film. By the time we end up at Devil's Island, two hours in, McQueen is totally locked into his part, but the film has beaten down my ability to care about his fate. Papillon may not have wasted his life, but ""Papillon"" wastes a fine central performance.",Papillon

He was never an actor, he simply stuck to a certain image and that was it. To be fair to him though, he did make some outstanding films. Several of his films were box office successes, including the above. Dustin Hoffman is the actor to watch, he conveys vulnerability as well as intelligence as a fellow inmate. From the first moment of ""Papillon,"" you never forget the harshness and cruelty that the prison staff inflict upon the convicts.

55,Chase_Witherspoon,Butterflies are free,10,12 May 2012,"Megastars McQueen and Hoffman manage to recruit their acting skills and put aside their persona's to play a pair of petty criminals convicted and sentenced to imprisonment by their French government in the colony of Guiana, preceded by a notoriety earned from unfathomable cruelty and harsh, oppressive conditions of incarceration. Despite the odds, McQueen can only contemplate escape as a means of balancing the ledger, for his apparent false imprisonment for murder. Hoffman as a meek, weak but extremely wealthy white-collar criminal seeks tough-guy McQueen's protection, leading him into a lifelong association that culminates in the pair being sent to Devil's Island, from which there has never been a successful escape.It's an intrepid tale told like an adventure with several sub-plots and narrative diversions, each distinct and entertaining in their own right. Some reviewers have questioned McQueen's dramatic presence and lack of accent, but I found him to be the one-dimensional character he was playing whose only, primal concern was freedom at almost any cost. Hoffman might be unrecognisable to some more familiar with his recent penchant for comedies; these were the films he used to make before he turned to less emotionally demanding roles. Pity. William Smithers has a good supporting role as a sympathetic prison warden, Woodrow Parfrey as the ill-fated Clusiot, Don Gordon, Victor Jory, John Quade, Anthony Zerbe, Gregory Sierra and even future Seinfeld cast member, Len Lesser have minor roles.

56,Sergeant_Tibbs,Epic with Steve McQueen's strongest performance. It's a shame it doesn't go anywhere.,6,10 July 2013,"While I really enjoyed Schaffner's Planet of the Apes, I was very dissatisfied with Patton and The Boys From Brazil. Unfortunately, Papillon is another disappointment, though I had no expectations. It's an attempt at emulating David Lean, updating the style to the rugged 1970s. With it's very cinematic photography, it immediately recalls the wide full frames of The Bridge Over The River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia, with some slow motion shots, POV shots and documentary style zooms scattered around for good measure. Everything is gritty and sweaty with wet walls and faces in every scene. It's much more gruesome than I expected, somewhat like a Sam Peckinpah film with all the red pain blood being spilled. It's a film that certainly knows how to kick a character right down to the very bottom and has us in for the ride. So it's great when our protagonist, Papillon (the nickname of Steve McQueen's character - which is French for butterfly, and involves an ironic butterfly catching scene) finally rises above the cruel oppressors. Unfortunately there's no point at all which indicates for me to care for the characters. The only reason I empathise is because human suffering is bad and escape is better than imprisonment - so that's what I want to see him overcome. Otherwise, there are no particularly likable characters. But what really kills the film is its extremely unjustifiably slow pace especially with very short scenes. Sometimes the development comes from montages when it could've come from a well written scene. It's bad enough that the film is 2 and a half hours anyway. It's ironic for a film with an Oscar nominated score to utilize silence so often - sometimes to great effect, but sometimes testing patience. Granted, for the most part it is well written. Just very bloated. There's funny moments that make the very downbeat film more lighthearted but there are times when it's awkwardly out of step for the film. There's a few dream sequences in there which are too obvious and bizarre for their own good. They come off as lazy writing rather than a genuine insight into the character's mind. Otherwise the film really doesn't spare details that it should've just to get to the point.Papillon is a generic triumph of will film posing as an episodic epic but it doesn't go anywhere. By the confusing third act - wherein it skips 5 years of film time that we don't glimpse into - the character plummets into insanity and is a broken man. While the film could have held my attention more if there was a big specific mystery I wanted answered throughout, it stuck to ""when will Steve McQueen escape?"" and when it inevitably happens, it doesn't feel like his will triumphed. It felt like his will was beaten to the point of his triumph being useless. Made the ending I'd been waiting for very unsatisfying. Particularly as the duo of Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman gain and lose many redundant accomplices on the way - though it's refreshing to see a duo not built out of chemistry as I expected, but out of tested trust and conflict. Plus to that point, it had blurred the lines between fantasy and reality that I wasn't sure if what was happening was real. The film does has its qualities, but the flaws certainly outweigh them upon reflection. Worth watching regardless, if just to see where they went wrong.6/10",Papillon
57,tomsview,The passion of Papillon,7,4 June 2013,"When I first saw ""Papillon"" in 1973, I thought it was a powerful and moving film, and that Steve McQueen as Papillon had given the performance of his career. Often painful to watch, he traversed those extra yards that only the most dedicated of actors will cross. He even ate a live cockroach! Of course, now, after many seasons of ""Survivor"" with Jeff Probst, we know that a lot of people will eat a cockroach, especially if there is money involved.Thirty years after its initial release, my admiration for the film is a little more tempered. What seemed incredibly harsh and realistic then, seems more contrived and less authentic now, especially some of the odd casting – Victor Jory as an Indian chief for example. However, ""Papillon"" still tells a compelling story and many scenes retain their power.Based on the best-selling book by Henri Charriére, it is supposedly true. The screenplay telescopes many of the events and introduces new characters, Louis Degas in particular.Found guilty of a murder he claims not to have committed, Papillon, a petty criminal, is sentenced to life imprisonment in French Guiana – the infamous Devil's Island. On the voyage he is hired for protection by Dustin Hoffman's character, Louis Degas. On arrival, the authorities warn the new inmates about escape attempts. However Papillon is determined to escape and never stops trying.He escapes a number of times, is often betrayed, and is always recaptured. After his first attempt fails, he is sent to solitary confinement for months and nearly dies. Louis smuggles food to him but it is discovered. The authorities try to make Papillon reveal who sent him the food but he refuses to speak. It is the first in a series of acts that cements the friendship between the two men.Many years pass and both men age. They are eventually sent to Devil's Island itself, from which it is thought there is no escape. However, Papillon's spirit has never been broken and he eventually escapes on a raft made from coconuts after leaping from the cliff tops.A combination of buddy movie and journey movie, by the end, both men have recognised their differences as human beings and are tolerant of each others foibles. They defend each other with acts of moral courage. It is this aspect of the film that stays in the memory more so than the exotic locations or the set piece escapes.The film is largely a two-hander by Hoffman and McQueen. Dustin Hoffman delivers an eye-catching, mannered performance, but it is Steve McQueen who stamps this film as above the ordinary. He obviously suffered for his art in this one; the weight-loss in some scenes is alarming and testifies to his commitment to the role.The score was by Jerry Goldsmith. With echoes of Debussy, it is infused with a feeling for the sea. Unfortunately the film also exhibits Franklin Shaffner's rather linear storytelling approach. There was little subtlety in the technique. A number of dream sequences are particularly heavy-handed. But all things considered, Shaffner elicited strong performances from the cast – even Victor Jory – and this human element is the key to the film's ultimate success as an unusual and well-told tale that rises above the occasional false note.",Papillon

60,blott2319-1,Well-told story that can be tough to watch,6,1 July 2020,"I'm always on board for a good prison break movie. Papillon delivers that in some fashion as we see Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman struggle to find a way of escape when trapped in a miserable prison in French Guiana far from any hope of finding civilization. It had that extra layer of complexity, because in order to escape, the men need to not only find a way out of the compound but also figure out a way of reaching the rest of the world. We certainly get to see the horrors of life in this type of prison, and I think it's a solid film for showing the ineffectiveness of solitary confinement. We see how this is merely a tool to wear men down close to death and insanity rather than any type of rehabilitation. One of the strangest things that I struggled to understand was how the characters were acquiring so much money while stranded in a prison. It seemed every scheme they hatched for escape required thousands of dollars just to get it off the ground and I don't get how a couple prisoners could stockpile that kind of cash.In the first half of the film I was inclined to give great praise to Steve McQueen's acting and the makeup team. They did a marvelous job of showing him worn down and broken by starvation. Yet both of these aspects lost me in the final scenes. The old-man makeup and acting was almost laughable, and took some of the emotional weight out of those scenes that they were trying to make powerful. I also have to say that Papillon is not an easy film to watch, because it is so brutal and spends a great deal of time in the oppression of that prison. The ending simply didn't lift it up enough to make what came before a great journey. I also wish they had utilized Dustin Hoffman a bit more, because he added something to the story, but so much of McQueen's struggle was meant to be isolated and alone. Still, there are good elements in Papillon that I appreciated, even if the overall viewing experience wasn't exactly delightful.",Papillon
61,sharky_55,"Hey you bastards, I'm still here.",7,22 December 2015,"This is a film that I think had all the potential to be a classic. Based on the memoir of the same name that I'm sure had an embellishment or two, about a tale of survival and escape and perseverance, and headed by a genuine movie star in McQueen. In spots, it can be great. There is a moment right after the trio escape the prison, that Dega falls down in agony while Papillon discovers that the boat they had been promised is rotten and no good. McQueen bursts into an uncharacteristic rage at the man he has just spent 2 years in solitary confinement for, and it could have been a visceral moment of pure emotion, having been foiled after the escape they had planned for so long, but it loses its power because McQueen chooses to put on this overwhelming sneer, which feels petty rather than being born of desperation and fear of once again being a prisoner. Both of them are convincing enough. Hoffman's Dega wears a pair of spectacles that balloon his pupils and give him this distinctly endearing geekiness. He frequently slips into his past persona as if he was once more selling counterfeit war bonds, and appealing to men and their patriotic pride and generosity. These sort of conniving salesmen are easy to befriend and to gain trust, but does it ever go beyond that? Papillon may be a better man than I, because it was hard to identify anything in their friendship that was worth those two torturous years in a dark cell. He tears up upon the end of that sacrifice, and as he makes his final leap to freedom, but is there really any substance to warrant it? It has trouble deciding what sort of film it should be. There's humour when Dega's intentions of luxury are foiled and we cut suddenly to the backbreaking Kilo 40, and when they encounter a crocodile and banter over who removes it. When Papillon is abused by the prison guards, the soundtrack balloons and exaggerates the hit and zooms in eagerly just to make sure we understand the impact. And there are several hallucination/dream sequences, which seem to belong to another film altogether, but speak so plainly and vaguely of themes that could apply to almost anything. These are much less effective than McQueen himself. In the most haunting scene, he mutters a wish to confess, but painstakingly resists the urge. He holds back tears, his lips tremble, and we can see every ounce of pain and sheer will in the bloodshot eyes of a man who so diligently values and chases his freedom, and chooses to forgo it for a friend. Later, as he leaves his second spell of confinement, this one 5 years, we see its effects via makeup that have made his body weak, his hair white, and his speech haggard, but it does not seem as bad as before. This is an issue of pacing; we spend entirely too much time in the first prison, and little after it. It seems to be a 2 hour film that has somehow conjured an extra half an hour in excess. There is an wordless sequence where Papillon stumbles upon a native colony, and somehow manages to befriend them and even find romance, and it is the most clichéd, insufferable and unnecessary segment of them all. Similarly, they also stumble upon a leper colony, and Papillon is once again a hit, treating them with empathy as if they were human beings too and gaining their assistance, but at least this is done with sincerity. Schaffner's biggest triumph is that it feels epic in scale. The focus stretches into infinity and shows just how isolated the prisoners are from the modern and civilised world, but also how beautiful and crazy the wild is. As they talk of escape with desire in their eyes, the endless sea's horizon bobbles in the background. Silvers of light in the cramped boat hold reveal the shiny sheen of the prisoner's sweaty bodies. They work in the forests, rain, hail or sun. As Papillon is dragged to confinement, they pass a idyllic beach-front, which is swapped for the grimy grey walls that he loses sanity in. Koenekamp silhouettes characters at golden hour paddling upstream, on pure white Hawaiian-style beaches drinking coconut juice, and atop the cliffs of Devil's Island, which contrary to its name, is covered in palm trees, piglets and streams full of crayfish. It seems like paradise, at least according to Dega, but is is not freedom. And in the final shot, we glide over and reveal the triumphant Papillon, who shouts jubilantly even as he has miles and miles of deep blue ocean still to traverse. This could have felt magnificent, but it is merely satisfying.",Papillon
62,rupie,superb,8,7 December 1999,"Steve McQueen was always an underrated actor in his time. Only now are we beginning to appreciate the range of his talent. His commanding performance in Papillon is a great demonstration of his skills. The transformation of Charriere from a relatively youthful man to a physically broken individual but with spirit intact, is a marvel. The presence of Dustin Hoffman in the key role of Dega doesn't hurt either. The movie captures an expansive sense of space and time, and, as well as being an epic of the human spirit, is just a hell of an adventure yarn to boot. And it's worth noting the movie's depiction of the barbaric prison system maintained by the French, those self-annointed defenders of liberte, egalite et fraternite. The fact that they perpetuated such a system well into the 20th century says a lot about Gallic hypocrisy.",Papillon

Owing to its classic status is due in parts to the fact that it is so well made and wonderfully acted. Good old Steve McQueen is great in the lead role going through one of the utterly worst ordeals almost possible, while the direction and editing is fluent; it never drags once in its 2 and a half hours runtime. This is now without question a classic film that should be tracked down by almost anyone and everyone.",Papillon
64,RonellSowes,Extensive but powerful,6,22 December 2020,"Henri Charriere's spent eleven years at Devil's Island,so there's no way to really make a short film about it. With that said,this film's length could have been shortened with unnesccary sections of this film being cut. The most prominent being when Charriere/Papillon resides with the natives. That entire sequence drags and weighs down on an already protracted-serving no justifiable purpose.There's an overused French term utilized too often to describe an actor's performance but I feel that it's a valid description in this case...a tour de force. Steve McQueen was never known for some tremendous acting abilities rather as a popular action star. But that doesn't go to say that McQueen wasn't a first class actor and his talents were never better displayed than in and as Papillon. Another superb actor in the picture,one more known for his dramatic skills,is Dustin Hoffman. While his part isn't as salient as McQueen's,Hoffman makes his part count and his performance in this film is...well,predictable Hoffman quality.
Papillon is an extensive film supported by sterling performances,expressive directing and discerning dialouge about one man's unquenchable thirst for freedom.",Papillon
65,tonypeacock-1,A harsh autobiographical film that is engaging,8,30 April 2020,"1973 autobiographical movie based on the book by Frenchman Henri Charriere. The late, great Steve McQueen plays the part of Charriere or Butterfly, known as Papillon who is wrongly convicted of murder and faces harsh punishment on a French penal colony Devil's Island. A desolate place that makes Alcatraz look like a picnic!On the way to the island on a prison ship Papillon befriends a fellow felon convicted of financial misdemeanors/counterfeiting Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman). Dega hides money in his body it appears and makes a mockery of his demeanor of an intelligent, thick rimmed glasses wearing character. Dega pleads with Papillon to be his bodygaurd whilst on the ship and the two form an alliance that goes on for several years.Papillon is determined to escape the prison and his attempts lead to long spells of solitary confinement. Now I am not talking a few days here. These spells last years! McQueen really put effort into his weakened physical appearance for these sections of the film. Visibly losing weight and dying his hair to show ageing. The production values of the film are high. Much of the film is shot on location in the exotic French islands of the Guinea region.The movie does stretch a little (approximately two and a half hours) and the embers of the film are stretched. However the performances of the principal cast are excellent supported well by actors some of whom I recognised from shows such as Lost In Space and the James Bond empire (Licence To Kill/Anthony Zerbe).Papillon is one of those under the radar movies that appears to have gone under my movie watching radar which is a shame because it is quite good. Hoffman and McQueen add more excellent performances. The fact that the story is supposedly true makes the scenes even more harrowing.",Papillon

This is the first Steve McQueen movie I've seen. I was extremely impressed with his performance and look forward to watching his other films. Dustin Hoffman is also superb as his good friend. I think one of the wardens was also in that Star Trek episode that took place in an ancient Roman setting. I know I'm rambling! There are some very graphic scenes in this film but they are not gratuitous. Two of the most memorable are McQueen's stay in solitary and his encounter with the leper colony.

67,barryrd,The strength of the human spirit,9,7 July 2013,"This wonderful movie is often overlooked and with more play on the movie channels, it would be appreciated for the classic it is. Its lustre comes from having two outstanding actors in Dustin Hoffman and Steve McQueen, as two men who cope with terrible adversity and never yield. Hoffman is a great character actor who has been a force in the world of film for over four decades. Steve McQueen is the lead and he is a film icon who enhanced every movie he starred in. The movie is based on a novel and semi-autobiography describing an extended sentence in a tropical penal colony. McQueen is Henri Charriere, known as Papillon because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest. Papillon is a man whose spirit is never broken. Throughout several failed escapes, humiliation, solitary confinement and every indignity inflicted on this man, he never gives up hope or succumbs to bitterness. Hoffman is Louis Degas, who reminds us of a modern day white collar criminal and worries about his wife sitting on top of his vast wealth. Degas and McQueen are friends who cooperate in their efforts to bust out of the hell hole known as Devil's Island. Degas uses his craftiness to acquire creature comforts but never gives up his dream of making the break with his loyal friend Charriere. The movie keeps you wondering what the next strategy will be. Plans are made, executed, and have some success until the authorities catch up with them and exact their brutal justice. This is a stunning movie, not just about prison life but the heroism and inspiration of these two men. I didn't think about what they might have done to be confined on this remote island because I was on their side. There is also an underlying assumption that it must have been a travesty of justice for these men to be sentenced to such a cruel fate. But It seems that Henri was convicted on a murder charge and Louis, as a counterfeiter. The strength of the human spirit portrayed by these men is the the real attraction of this film. It is enhanced by a superb production and photography. Highly recommend.",Papillon
68,RJBurke1942,Indomitable persistence and determination in real-life drama.,8,2 October 2007,"Coming from some of McQueen's earlier movies like The Getaway (1972), Le Mans (1971), Bullitt (1968) and others, when I first saw this film in 1974 I came away disappointed and bewildered a bit, I think. It was such a change for him that I probably thought he had been miscast.Now, that was thirty-three years ago when I was much younger and perhaps more impressionable and susceptible to Hollywood hype. Whatever...Recently, however, I got a DVD of the film and had another look  and was I glad I did! I've not read the book, so I can't compare that to the film narrative. As a well-produced and well-acted movie, however, it certainly stands the test of time. And  surprise  McQueen's performance is much better than I recall. In fact, I'd go as far to say it could be regarded as his best performance in a dramatic role. For that alone, it's worth seeing.Dustin Hoffman gives another sterling performance as the eccentric counterfeiter Louis Dega and watching the two actors bounce off each other verbally is a joy to watch and hear. Alas, only a few nominations for this really good film; I guess the competition for Oscars that year was very strong.The cinematography and editing are quiet good; but this is not Lawrence of Arabia (1962) that did win for those categories, among others. The jungle backdrops are superb, the golden beaches scintillating in the ever-present sun. The best part for me, however (aside from the fine acting), is the script by Dalton Trumbo, one of Hollywood's great writers who fell victim to the excesses of the 1950s MacCarthy witch-hunts.And the story? Who can resist a real-life account about the only man who ever managed to escape from Devil's Island and live to tell the tale? See this one for sure. And, if you've seen it before, have another look. You won't regret it.",Papillon

There was even none of his days in venezuela, which came across so powerfully in the book.On a lighter note, Dustin Hoffman was passable as Dega, even if I didn't find Steve McQueen particularly believable as Papi.Perhaps I just watched this too soon after I finished reading the book, and its sequel Banco.",Papillon
71,davidcarniglia,Cenitipede Soup In Solitary,9,28 July 2018,"A great drama, and an epic adventure. I saw this when it first came out; I remember the leper colony scene, but hardly anything else. Thankfully, I came back to Papillon.McQueen was perfectly cast as the title character; this might be his best performance. The zigzagging between hope and despair, idyllic freedom and abject suffering, with all the shades in between, shows excellent writing, even given the fascinating original story. McQueen's severe and abrupt changes of fortune point out the nuances of human behavior, as well as the role of chance in life.None of this highly complex atmosphere would work without the mixture of sympathy with sadism, hospitality with hostility, exotic, picturesque locales with the numb routine of the prison cell. Not all the guards are brutal, not all the prisoners deserve our sympathy. Likewise, the various 'outsider' cultures are in different worlds from the prison culture, as well as from each other.There are several poignant scenes: the guys in solitaire who introduce themselves as they poke their heads out of their cells, reassuring their neighbor that they 'look well', when they probably both know that the other looks terrible. The friendships broken by death, suddenly or slowly rendered, of an old friend or a new one, happen with pathetic regularity. The capacity to share and to help keeps the prisoners human, even uplifting them.I'm tempted to say that there's an existential thread running through Papillon, given that the book was written in the 30s, at the height of the French existentialist movement. Certainly there's meticulous attention to the existentialist theme of surviving in an absurd world with dignity. Oddly enough, with the crushing level of authority ruling the prisoners, they retain the considerable freedom of their attitude towards their dilemma.Even as pure adventure, Papillon succeeds. The cinematography is beautiful where beauty is present, and horrifying where terror rules. I usually zone-out when a movie runs more than two hours, but in this case I didn't want it to end. McQueen is the quintessential adventurer. He overcomes so many obstacles; but he's not superman, and so he also makes plenty of mistakes. His character's demeanor as a cautious but essentially trusting man serves him well.He survives because he knows that there's no obvious truth, but only situations; and each calls for its own plan. The flashes of humor highlight the discrepancies between what one expects, and what actually happens. No one would expect a prison movie to show inmates chasing butterflies--but there it is, and it certainly fits. McQueen's nonchalance is put to the ultimate test when he accepts the leper's cigar. That he unwittingly fools the leper shows a superb interplay of danger and luck.There's considerable deception going on throughout. A game-like quality coexists with the deadly serious aspects of repeated escape and confinement. That brings up my only issue with Papillon: Dustin Hoffman's performance shows too much posing, and not enough grit.He's got this bemused look that doesn't fit his character. It's as though he's above it all, in on all the machinations of prison life, and even comfortable with it. He does makes a good foil for McQueen's restlessness, but his Zen-like gaze is a bit much.We really don't get into ethics here; clearly neither McQueen's nor Hoffman's characters are violent criminal types. Some of the characters have probably been rail-roaded, but some of them are murderers. In a way, it doesn't matter what the characters have done to land them in Guyana. We're judging them on how they act in these moments.A great movie; intricate, and yet, all of a piece. 9/10.",Papillon

73,richieandsam,A lot better than I was expecting...,7,8 November 2012,"PAPILLONI thought it was really good. I had been putting it off for a while because it didn't really take my fancy... but last night I decided to watch it.The movie is about a man who has been imprisoned on an island called Devil's Island and his numerous bids to escape.It stars Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman... I have only seen a couple of Steve McQueen's films but I have to say he has been brilliant in them all. I will be looking out for more of his movies. Steve plays Papillon... and he plays it well. The stress and health problem his character goes through in this movie was horrible and believable to watch. At one point Papillon looked so ill that he nearly died. He actually looked really bad. He goes through such a rough time trying to escape but never gives up. He meets someone there who he gets close to and they try and escape together. Dustin Hoffman plays his friend really well too. I am not a big Dustin Hoffman fan, but this is one of his best films that I have seen.The film is on for just under 2 and a half hours, which is very long... but to be honest it didn't feel like it. It didn't drag out and I didn't get restless during the movie.I tried not to compare this to Steves other famous escape film, but I couldn't help it before watching it... but they are 2 completely different movies. If you have not seen this, do not compare them because they are not the same. I didn't like this film as much as the Great Escape though, but it was still very enjoyable.The only mistake I saw whilst watching it was when Papillon was sitting on a makeshift raft floating in the sea and you could actually see someone swimming underneath his raft holding it to make sure it didn't move too much. I mean it really was very obvious, I noticed it straight away... but don't get me wrong. That just amused me and didn't ruin the movie.I will give this film 7 out of 10...

74,bsinc,"Rather controversial movie, I presume",7,26 February 2005,"""Papillon"" stroke me as a little shocking since I wasn't expecting so much ""controversial"" material in a movie this old, in other words, a movie with Steve Mcqueen. Homosexuality, nudity, loads of blood and gore, elements which today STILL have it hard and are somewhat still regarded as tabu. The movie itself is highly entertaining and beautiful to watch but I wasn't really impressed with neither the acting or the story. Steve Mcqueen was never a very good actor for my standards of acting and although he has many really bright moments in this one his inability to stop switching his role on and off to his usual Steve Mcqueen persona didn't help much. Dustin Hoffman is better but is still more of an ""along for the ride"" character, not his greater work. Prison movies are always entertaining just for their location and this one is saved by some great torture scenes and escapes. Well worth the watch though. 7/10",Papillon

76,jayjaycee,Butterflies need to be free,7,10 May 2020,"""Papillon"" is a 1973 crime drama directed by Franklin J. Schaffner starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. Now that I have seen probably the greatest escape flick last week, I thought it was time to give another entry from that genre a watch. Ten years after his last cinematic jailbreak, the king of cool once again took himself behind barred windows, but this time he is accompanied by another absolute legend, one of my favourite actors, the and only Dustin Hoffman. It was simply astonishing to see those two men, who I have seen on their own in countless titles and idolized since then, acting together. It filled me with some special kind of joy, as it made me feel like I am watching the ultimate crossover. Instead of a detention camp somewhere in Germany, the protagonists are now taken to the penal colony of French Guiana, a place that looks like paradise but ends up being hell to them instead. Dalton Trumbo himself adapted the novel of the same name of which author Henri Charrière claims to be autobiographical, although the verisimilitude of his claims has never been proven. If that what he has described was indeed true, then this man really went to all stages of hell during his sentence and this film doesn't hesitate to depict the brutality of the terrible events he has been trough. Speaking of which, it is one thing that immediately stroke the eye. The only issue I had with last weeks film was the lack of realistic authority and rough treatment on the part of the prison administration and this film is the total opposite of it, as it graphically depicts the mercilessness and bestiality of the guards. Just the fact that they threaten the inmates by showing that they guillotine still works upon their arrival already says it all. No, they are no factor to be reckoned with and that is what creates this constant danger, and already in the beginning it conveyed me the feeling that this escape won't be fine and fancy and that McQueen would not be superior to his enemies this time. This film indeed poses the complete opposite to the light-hearted nature of the 1963 film and goes all brutal instead. That factor is also visible by the extreme use of graphic violence and even though the blood looked more fake than realistic, it had a major impact on the atmosphere of the film. The more people were brutalised or ruthlessly killed, the more you know that the threat is real and that Papi's attempted escapes will not be tolerated just like this and uncompromisingly punished. Given the shocking demises of some of his fellow inmates, you really started to worry about him and his bold actions and yet it is hard to fully sympathize with him. That's one of the minor flaws of the film. As cool and charismatic both McQueen and Hoffman were, the film didn't give me the chance to fully find a connection to them and in view of the fact that both rank high up in the list of my favourite actors, it was indeed peculiar to see that the screenplay did not manage to draw on this personal preoccupation of mine. Aside from this, I also wasn't entirely satisfied with the plot. The basic premise of course had my undivided attention and promised an infernal journey the protagonists would embark on and it indeed was packing and thrilling in the beginning, but the more the film proceeded the more it distanced itself form its core idea. The total runtime of two and a half hours also doesn't come in useful for this film and appeared unpleasantly lengthy most of the time. While the first third initiated the intensity in depicting the arrival in the colony and established the character constellation, the second third depicted the torture of a man and in increased the same effect, the third and final act totally lost the thread. In the beginning, I was excited about the atmosphere and hoped to see some intense fights between our protagonist and his enemies all the while witnessing his struggling for survival, but it in the end it went into another direction instead, a direction of which I cannot really say that I was full pleased with. I mean, it depicted the end of the escape and has shown us that he succeeded, but what was that with the overlong sequence with the indigenous tribe, the leper colony and the monastery? It unnecessarily wasted a lot of time on pointless scenes and that was the moment the film has lost its grip and became diffuse and did not entertain me anymore. Trouble is, before it got to the questionable ending, it had me on the edge of my seat most of the time and completely packed me. Steve McQueen delivers a powerful performance, as he makes the transition from being a hopeful, strong man with ambitions and desires to a fragile and weak geriatric extremely credible. It was quite shocking to see how the actor whose characters always seem to have an ace in the hole and be one step ahead is at his worst in this one and far away from being the one who is on top of everything. To be honest, although I was surely aware that the whole story is (presumably) based on the life experiences of a man who of course survived all of it, I was seriously concerned that he was not going to get out of there alive. While I think it could have been even more interesting if they had explored the inner conflict and the personality of the character (as it is implied with the dream sequences and the prominent butterfly metaphoric) and thus have given him more depth, McQ's performance is without a doubt the driving force behind this film and I wish I could say that about Hoffman as well. While his portrayal as the counterfeiter with the iconic large glasses and a lot of important money is also nothing to be scoffed at, I had the strong feeling that his character was heavily underused in this film and didn't get enough time to shine. He played a significant role, as he literally financed the most important events, but it still seemed like he could have been present more. I think that is one of the indicators that the film doesn't offer quite the best coherence. As I stated before, the film is basically divided into three parts, what generally poses no problem at all, but in this case the episodic narration adds to the lack of conclusiveness. It is getting to the point that I had the strange feeling that all those three different episodes were directed by three different people and that those tonal discrepancies compromised the experience severely, what is kind of sad, as two of three episodes are almost flawless if viewed individually, but hence it is one film and not three short features on their own, it is a major problem. Another thing that adds to this strange inconsistency is the uncertainty about the time span the film covers. I personally assume that the film takes place over a course of several years, but there are some things that bedevil the identifying of the depicted period. Close to the end, for instance, Papillon returns from solitary confinement and all suddenly has grey while being absolutely invalid, and also his companion Maturette looks like he has aged at least fifteen years, but Hoffman's Louis Dega still looks the same and not a bit older. Of course, it is possible that the isolation Papi caused him to become frail, but you can't tell me that he went full Ben Kenobi while the others still look the same or just slightly different. It leaves me wondering if the whole final sequence was real and not just the delusional last thoughts of our protagonist, as he slowly succumbs to his physical condition in prison. I mean, the man is visibly struggling to stand upright, and you want to tell me that he survived a jump down a cliff into the riptide? I don't think so. All in all, this prison flick offers powerful acting in gorgeous settings and even though it looks stunning and certainly is extremely atmospheric, it lacks the coherence and loses the extreme intensity it offered in the beginning, the more it moves on. It started out vigorously but is letting up continuously. It could have been way better and most importantly, much shorter and thus more packing, and while it has been a riptide in the beginning, it is nothing more than a shallow wave in the end. Not a disaster, but sadly not as brilliant as I hoped it to be either.",Papillon
77,ragingbull_2005,Best prison-life/prison break movie ever.,9,19 June 2012,"For me, this ranks along with ""the shawshank redemption"" as the absolute best among prison life or prison break movies. with a stunning background score which for the most part of the movie does not have any music and has only the sound which closely resembles that of boiling water, you really live the prison life. the seclusion scenes are some of the most powerful i have ever seen. Steve Mcqueen gives what is easily the best performance of his career. Dustin Hoffman as the counterfeiter who is along with Mcqueen in the prison spots a nerdy look and is excellent. like the better known ""shawshank redemption"", this also did not get any recognition by the Academy and was strangely nominated only for best music. the movie is very gripping and does not drag even though it is close to 150 minutes. this is the best time i have had in the drama genre at the movies for the recent path",Papillon
78,jb_campo,Great acting in a terrific story,8,16 July 2017,"I recently watched Papillon after seeing a Decades TV show about Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman as Dega stars alongside a super cool Steve McQueen as Papillon. Papillon and Dega are convicted of crimes in France and sent to prison basically to die, in French Guinea. You are walked through the seriousness of parades thru the streets of France, to a dangerous ocean passing, to the grim arrival in prison where you are told of your chances. Worst of all, there is no escape. People have tried, but never successfully.Dega has apparently quite a bit of money, mostly from counterfeiting, while Papillon is a thief. They form a friendship based on protection but then later that forms into friendship and a lifelong bond.The cinematography is bold, thinking back to 1973 mind you. The story is sharp and crisp, except for one scene during part of the escape where I'm not sure it was real, or if he was fantasizing. There is beautiful scenery that might make you say, hey, I could end up being stuck there. But Papillon wants to fly like a butterfly and be free always. No matter how long you put him in solitary, deprive him of food, light, companionship. He keeps on going like the energizer bunny till the end.Hoffman and McQueen are two of our all-time great actors, near the prime of their acting careers, in a terrific story with great direction and cinematography. Some small parts of the escape get a bit long, which made me wonder if this was like Life of Pi. But whatever, the results are the same. Can they pull off the greatest escape ever?

Dustin Hoffman co stars and Franklin Schaffner who did such a great job on Patton directed.This was Allied Artists biggest hit.Steve McQueen lost interest in his career and died at the early age of 50.To me Steve McQueen was a defining star of his era and was a true Star",Papillon
80,shepardjessica-1,Great Soundtrack & Decent Adventure!,6,21 November 2004,"Steve McQueen is impressive in this as are Dustin Hoffman's eyeglasses (the thickest in movie history) and the music is incredible. Decent directorial job by Franklin Schaffner, but something's missing from this epic tale of escape and madness. It's too long for sure.A 6 out of 10. Best performance = Mr. McQueen. Billy Mumy (from Lost in Space) has a brief appearance and Anthony Zerbe as a leper is sad and creepy. It's always nice to see Don Gordon (also in Bullitt with McQueen) and the location shooting is exotic and treacherous. The script has problems, though, that can't be overcome. It doesn't really flow.",Papillon
81,arthurclay,Shockingly great,9,25 May 2005,"This is one of those movies that a person needs to see but doesn't necessarily want to see twice because it is so gut wrenching. When you see this one cannot help but entertain the notion that only the French could have such little respect and place such little value on human life. That isn't true but it isn't completely wrong due to their past horrid prison systems and their extreme use of the guillotine. Steve MacQueen is powerful and equally so is Dustin Hoffman and yes I agree with another commenter that as far as acting goes this may be the best movie each one of them did. This film, as several others namely Cool Hand Luke, The Shawshank Redemption, Escape from Alcatraz really drives the point home that prisons are not supposed to be fun places to be yet they should not be houses of pain, suffering, torture, and premature death either. The lack of decency in this movie by the people who are not in prison is staggering and just plain sick. It makes me want to cry and I'm not even a soft hearted person. Some of these men deserved to go to Devil's Island but none deserved the treatment they received there. MacQueen's character, Papillon, is framed for a murder he didn't commit and sent to French Guyana to serve a life sentence. He quickly meets up with Louis Dega, a master counterfeiter and rich man who is in desperate need of a bodyguard. Papillon agrees to do the job if Dega will buy him a boat to escape with. As the film progresses Dega and Papillon fall deeper and deeper into the hell that is the St. Laurent prison. They watch their comrades die and be killed and they are helpless bystanders. Each time they try to improve their situations with bribery, cleverness, and escape attempts they find themselves in worse shape than before. This would be a comedy or farce if it wasn't so damn tragic and heart breaking. Hoffman plays the rich criminal with a heart of gold to a tee and MacQueen plays the wrongfully convicted man who won't give up and simply just refuses to die. They share a bond as fellow inmates, partners in crime and friends who won't run up the white flag no matter how rough it gets or what is at stake namely their sanity even more than their freedom or what is left of their condemned lives. A noteworthy piece of art.",Papillon
82,mgruebel,Theater at its best,8,6 October 2019,"I first saw this film in the mid-70s on Austrian TV, probably not long after it came out. Too young to fully understand it, I was still impressed - it stuck to my mind for many years, unlike most films that I saw. I saw it again decades later, still impressed.The film is theater in the grand sense. It is sometimes grandiose and pompous, and heavy with symbolism. But this only enforces that human beings who really should be hopeless can never afford to be without hope. It's an example of how collaboration and the dream of freedom can prevail in a way. The only stranger sense of escape into hope that I have seen in a film is Gilliam's Brazil, where the main character finally has no choice by to escape into a dream of happiness while being tortured. Things do end happier in Papillion.Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman gave great performances, as did the other actors: the guards are really as much prisoners as the convicts, and respond with anything from brutality to compassion. The film then becomes a series of set pieces to illustrate a man who never gives up, and ultimately, after many years, prevails, despite throwing his pearls to treacherous sows.",Papillon
83,mohit_sinsniwal,WOW!,7,1 June 2019,"Henri 'Papillon' Charriere, was a lifetime inmate under the French government's harsh penal system in French Guiana. In his declining years he wrote his memoirs describing his years of incarceration, his cruel mistreatment and daring, multiple escapes. Weather or not he was the actual character of his own book, is disputed to this day. But the fact that he was an inmate is true enough and fits in with the actual site which came to be known as 'Devil's Island.' Court records indicate that Henri Charriere (Steve McQueen) later called "" Papillon "" which is french for Butterfly, was indeed a minor burglar and safe cracker. His claim he was innocent of murder, may be true enough, due to an unreliable source accusing him in court, yet producing little supporting evidence. Nevertheless, the infamous thief was given a twenty year sentence, which was extended due to his numerous escapes. During his imprisonment, he becomes lifelong friends with an equally famous treasury forger named Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman). Don Gordon (a real life friend of McQueen) plays Julot, an experienced prisoner with his own intentions of escape. Anthony Zerbe is hideously interesting as Toussaint, a ravaged leper, who aids escaping prisoners. The entire film is one remarkable story and becomes an incredible journey, one which transcends the screen and offers audiences, the raw reality of life under the most severe and brutal penal systems in the world. The infamous 'Devil's Island ' today has become synonymous with a hellish place of unspeakable conditions. A fantastic movie for those in search of true-life Classic. ****",Papillon

85,xlars,"Great movie, even greater book!",9,1 December 1999,"There are certain things a movie cannot portray, they aren't very visible to the naked eye unless you've read the book. As in other terms, I'd recommend reading the book after seeing the movie, however - because your expectations won't be hurt as much then...",Papillon
86,lucasversantvoort,Deliberately paced drama,7,11 May 2015,"What stands out to me about Papillon is the continued teamwork between one of the great director/composer collaborations: director Franklin J. Schaffner and composer Jerry Goldsmith. I even found out about the film solely because of Goldsmith. Imagine my surprise when the film was actually pretty darn good too.The film is based on the true story of Henri Charriere who was sentenced to life and taken an infamous penal colony on Devil's Island, off the coast of French Guyana. Once there, he meets Louis Dega, a forger. Though Dega first hires Henri as a bodyguard, they soon bond. What follows are their day by day trials at the penal colony and their multiple escape attempts.If you're going into this film expecting another The Great Escape, then you'll undoubtedly come out disappointed. This is not an adventure film taking place in a prison, but a film about life in prison. That combined with the film's length of 2,5 hours and it wouldn't be any surprise if it bored you stiff. I can't help but feel however that the length is to the film's benefit. Like Henri and Dega, you too get exhausted from the film's depressing locales and harsh prison life. Maybe this is all merely rationalization, but hey I guess your mileage may vary here. At least for me, the film wasn't boring. There were many things that kept my attention: McQueen's and Hoffman's performances, the way the film conveys through Dega the notion that life in the colony may actually be preferable than escaping, the long, tiring sequence with Henri in solitary confinement. This is a film that risks being boring by plausibly conveying life on Devil's Island and is all the better for it.When you read my opening paragraph you just knew I was going to discuss Goldsmith's score again. It's about 40 minutes long, so it's only occasionally heard in the 2,5 hour long film, but that's one of the reasons it makes such an impact. Entire scenes are carried by nothing but diegetic sound. This includes the entire solitary confinement scene which only enhances the realism. So, when music does appear, the dramatic effect is enhanced. Everything from the French-sounding, wonderful main theme, to the Debussian 'Catching Butterflies' and 'Gift from the Sea', to the climactic escape music (pay attention to the many differences and similarities between the music accompanying Henri's escape attempts), this is one of the great film scores.The biggest thing that might hold this film back is its length and the 'realistic' treatment of its subject matter. The performances and sense of realism in the portrayal of this particular slice of prison life might appeal to you the same way it did to me, or it might bore you to tears.",Papillon

Great acting, directing, cinematography, script, etc. It is based on a book in which the author - Henri Charrière - shared his own experiences, as well as those that he stole from other inmates and claimed as being his own. As for the real Papillon, a different inmate had the tattoo and was known by that name. Charrière had the tattoo copied and took the name for himself.The man was a hardened criminal, so honesty could not be expected. On the other hand, regardless of origin the book stands up well as does this movie. Take it for what it is - a story inspired by actual events from various sources.",Papillon
88,DeuceWild_77,"One of the best ""escape from prison"" movies ever made, skillful direction by Schaffner and top notch performances from McQueen & Hoffman !!",10,7 March 2018,"Frankin J. Schaffner was a great filmmaker, well known for his intense use of realism; his gritty, but stylish visual style; the innovative way of using the camera and, above all, his talented skills as a storyteller, responsible in commanding incredible screen epics such as ""Planet of the Apes"" ('68); ""Patton"" ('70); ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" ('71) and ""The Boys from Brazil"" ('78).""Papillon"", from a screenplay penned by the ex-blacklisted, Dalton Trumbo & Lorenzo Semple Jr., based on the 1969 autobiography by the French convict, Henri Charrière, it's one of his best films, a genuine landmark on the ""prison movies"" sub-genre, as well one of the pinnacles of the 70's cinema.Its own realism is astonishing, since the very first scene when the viewer learn about those doomed men coming from all social classes, convicted to a strictly sentence on the French Guiana, an inhuman penal colony (located on the north Atlantic coast of South America in the Guyanas, an overseas department of France), Schaffner shot it in almost documentary style on the subject, the long way to their own personal hell.Among them, is our protagonist, an anti-hero that calls himself ""Papillon"" (the french word for ""Butterfly""), a man wrongly accused to have killed a pimp, that refuses to be institutionalized and his determination to escape makes him to become friends with a popular forger, named Louis Dega, which have more (hidden) money to bribe and finance an escape, than courage itself.
The two will form a solid friendship that will last for almost two decades...Steve McQueen gives here his best on-screen performance of his short lived life, even better than his only Oscar nominated role in ""The Sand Pebbles"" ('66), he's impressive & amazing and totally believable as Charrière (even if he was almost 20 years older than the real ""Papillon"" when he arrived at the French Guiana) and as both a method and physical actor, he was not afraid to be filmed dirty, unshaven, covered in rags and even going to the mud of Kilo 40's filthiest swamp, in an excellently staged & shot scene, when both our protagonists are trying to catch a wounded, but furious alligator.McQueen surpassed himself here and delivered a 'tour de force' haunting performance that the viewer will never forget (Schaffner must have contributed to it, because as a great director of actors, he was responsible for four of his actors have been Oscar nominated: Lee Tracy in ""The Best Man"" ('64); George C. Scott in ""Patton"" ('70), which he won, but refused; Janet Suzman in ""Nicholas and Alexandra"" ('71) and Sir Laurence Olivier in ""The Boys from Brazil"" ('78), as well giving the glorious Chuck Heston a career resurgence in the critical acclaimed and box office hit, ""Planet of the Apes"" ('68). McQueen's snub for an Oscar nomination (he was nominated for the Golden Globe) may have been due to his affair with Ali MacGraw, then the wife of one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood, Robert Evans, and even if McQueen married her around the time ""Papillon"" was released, the bitterness of Evans may have cost him the deserved recognition.Dustin Hoffman, still fresh from his two Oscar nominated roles in ""The Graduate"" ('67) and ""Midnight Cowboy"" ('69), emerged as the new star for the 70's Era and also delivered an excellent performance as the cowardly submissive and resigned, Dega, in a unforgettable turn that also deserved more praise.The supporting cast delivers honest and reliable performances such as Don Gordon (one of McQueen's closest friends and his regular co-star) as the Ill-fated Julot; Woodrow Parfrey as Clusiot or an unrecognizable Anthony Zerbe in a sympathetic turn as Toussaint, the chief from the Leper Colony, the only man from the outside world that treated Charrière with dignity and respect (and vice versa).The cinematography and the peculiar camera angles used are top notch, we can feel the sweat from the convicts and the filth from the Penal Colony, as much as their desperation and the scenes with McQueen in the solitary confinement are among the best ever filmed in this sub-genre.Jerry Goldsmith, an usual colaborator of Schaffner, once again got an Oscar nomination for his memorable orchestration here and it's hard to believe that it was the only Oscar nomination that this masterpiece got.Some purists argue that the movie distances too much from the source material (Dega's involvement in the autobiography is way shorter), but books and movies are two different mediums, and it needed changes to work as a motion picture.In short, the ""escape from / prison"" movies, it's a sub-genre that fortunately, have lots of (near) masterpieces filmed, such as Jules Dassin' ""Brute Force"" ('48) & John Frankenheimer's ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" ('62) both starring Burt Lancaster; John Sturges' ""The Great Escape"" ('63) also with Steve McQueen; Stuart Rosenberg's ""Cool Hand Luke"" ('67) starring Paul Newman or Don Siegel's ""Escape from Alcatraz"" ('79) starring Clint Eastwood, but ""Papillon"" it's easily placed on the Top 5 of the whole lot, offering a thrilling and engaging experience, as well a profound and heart touching life journey about the perseverance of a human being, tested to the limit, who never gave up.As a footnote, this movie's distinctive visual style, cinematography and direction, influenced a lot of future productions, such as William Friedkin's ""Sorcerer"" ('77); Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" ('79) and even Steven Spielberg's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ('81), among lots of others...",Papillon

Filmed on a spectacular scale by director Franklin Schaffner, with masterful camera-work by Fred Koenekamp, this movie cost a fortune and it shows. At first Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman are an unlikely pair, but their contrasting acting styles eventually seem to mesh, as the story inexorably builds to a poignant finale. If you like McQueen, you'll love this. Be warned: there is much graphic violence and the bugs are real! Also, the film is long and non-McQueen fans may find it heavy going. But Charriere's tale (embellished as it may have been) contained a wealth of incident, and this film packs a lot into two-and-a-half hours.

97,laursene,Hollywood's first non-stereotypical gay character?,8,6 April 2007,"Does anyone remember the name of the medic who escapes over the wall with Papillon and Dega - is it Maturette? In any case, he may mark the first time Hollywood created a gay character - at least in a big-budget film - who is sympathetic, not stereotypical or ridiculous or treacherous, and is given his fair share of personal dignity. First, Papillon wants to prostitute him to distract a guard so that he can escape: He lets Papillon know in no uncertain terms that he's ""not a whore"" and that ""Between the two of us, I'm the one who's killed a man."" Later, he shows bravery, solidarity, and resourcefulness equal to the two leads'.It's a fairly large role, the actor makes a strong impression, yet (almost as important) the filmmakers don't showcase him in a self-congratulatory way (""Look how progressive we are!""). He's not offset by any more ""typical"" gay characters to lessen his impact, nor, thankfully, by one of those ritual gang-rape-of-the-male-lead scenes that seem to be obligatory in prison pictures (e.g., ""The Shawshank Redemption""). This is all especially remarkable in that Hollywood movies at the time were still rife with abysmal gay stereotypes (see ""Play Misty for Me,"" ""The Eiger Sanction,"" ""The Producers,"" any number of others in all kinds of genres.) I'd love to know if this was a conscious decision by Schaffner or the screenwriters (Trumbo and Semple both had good progressive credentials, after all).By the way, if you're going to see this film, see it letterboxed - it loses much of its visual impact in a standard TV pan-and-scan format.",Papillon

McQueen was good in the role as the strong Papillon, and Hoffman was really the right man to play the intellectual Louis Dega. You could say that the movie is very dark, but there are actually some funny moments in the movie which works just fine.
I will also pay some tribute to the composer Jerry Goldsmith, he has also composed the great scores for ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Patton"". He is one of the reasons why Schaffner's movies are great.There is no doubt that this movie is good, I could write a lot about some interesting scenes, but that would spoil your experience with this movie.

99,berberian00-276-69085,Papi bargains with the Court,10,9 October 2013,"Let's try to put some order about the issue at hand - Papillon (1973), the Movie. This film is based on Henri Charrière's 1970 best-selling book ""Papillon"" which represents a former convict auto-biography. Charrière spent 11 years in prison in French Guiana, during this period he attempted to escape several more times resulting in increasing penalties from his captors. He was then confined to Devil's Island, a labor camp at solitary island opposite the French territory. From there he finally achieved to escape by using a bag of coconuts as a raft and riding the tide arrived in Venezuela. He lived 20 years there on restaurant business and became celebrity - described in a sequel to Papillon entitled Banco (1970). Lastly he get paroled and returned to France in the 1970s where approached by Franklin Schaffner served as technical consultant to the above movie. Charrière died of cancer shortly before the movie was released.The confusion about authorship and some of the episodes described in the novel comes from the fact that it replicates a similar French novel on escape from Devil's Island labor camp - i.e., René Belbenoit's ""Dry Guillotine"" (Guillotine Sèche) first published in 1938 by E. F. Dutton & Co., New York. The book remained forgotten after the World War II, but the experience of escaped convict was there while this time the story evolved along the diagonal Surinam - Panama - California. Belbenoît died as US immigrant in 1956.Now on the film ""Papillon"" (1973) itself. I have a DVD release in my collection that have a bonus material - 12 min. short documentary with protagonist Henri Charrière. The man is there in apparently good physical condition and partnering to Steve McQueen, Dustin Hoffman and the Director. Certainly, many of the scenes in this movie were shot on location at actual islands of French Guiana. Also, the music and orchestration in this movie are tremendous with the leading theme humming in the head on hours after the spectacle.If I had missed something, well, don't blame me. I want to add here a list of 12 movies that should be considered favorites in the so called ""prison escape genre"". My screening procedure was arbitrary and no real criteria were used except an inmate story (preferably with documentaries) and some good actor's play.

101,msultan,ego trip?,5,27 July 2003,"Papillon has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Blame it on the historian in me, but the rendering of what couldhave been an interesting story ends up being an American moviewith American actors displaying American characteristics of themisunderstood victim whose grand ideals have no limits(whereas it's all supposed to be French, right?).  Steve McQueen is pathetic overblown hero figure who has theworst lines anyone with a brain can come up with.  Despite ALLhis troubles, he still has room for humor and determination. Neverdown, no, not him.Unfortunately Dustin Hoffman does not save this movie. His role isjust as pathetic and he seems stuck in his Midnight Cowboycharacter's awkward nerdiness.  Of course this also serves ashumor when the movie isn't going anywhere.Another drawback in this movie is that we have no idea when thisis happening or how long things are taking to develop.  *spoilers*How long does Papillon stay on that island (where he befriendsand charms the natives, to the point of painting a butterfly on thechief's torso. He even has a girlfriend!  Are the kids his?  Why theheck doesn't he sow his shirt or exchange it for something else?)before getting caught again?  Even in the prison, we have no ideahow long anything is taking except for the 7 years of solitaryconfinement.Some parts in this movie looked like they were trying to re-enactRobert Redford and Paul Newman's friendship in Butch Cassidyand the Sundance Kid (namely the cliff scenes), but it isunsuccessful and lame.  Although a lot of work was put into this movie (it's very rich inannoyances), the result is a typical ""I'm-a-determined-American- and-all-I-do-is-great"" hero movie, the lead part going to McQueen. The script is bad, the acting is bad, the dialogue is horrible, thescenery is inconsistent (the jungle looks like a set but the sea isgood), the music is good (but not good enough to make a goodmovie), and the overall result a total waste of time.",Papillon
102,Degree7,"""I'm still here you bastards!""",9,28 October 2013,"So says Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière as he desperately clings to the bars of his cell, ever defiant in the face of life imprisonment in the French penal colony of Guiana. It is where he and many other inmates of the French prison institution were sent to live out their sentences in the period between 1852 and 1952. Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman make a fine cinematic pair, two prisoners who seek each other out for mutual benefit in the harsh climate of French Guiana. Hoffman's Louis Dega, the bespectacled bookkeeper looking for protection from the fellow murderous inmates that would like nothing better than to slit open his insides and rummage around for the chargers of money hidden in his rectum. He employs Papillon as his defacto bodyguard, but on the assurance that Dega will fund his escape from the seemingly inescapable prison island system. Together the pair ride out the grueling boat journey across the Atlantic, weathering harsh working conditions, tropical diseases, sadistic guards, alligators, manhunters, local tribes, and all manner of pitfalls and treachery. With each escape attempt they are punished with increasing severity, until the human depravity is at an almost intolerable peak. At first the prisoners are somewhat shocked by the horrible standards, but as the years go on, death seems to be commonplace, and no one looks twice at a starved or collapsed boy laying in the jungle heat. The colony is akin to a concentration camp, and indeed perhaps that was the intention. The two leads act as perfect complimentary foils to each other, with McQueen representing the freedom fighter that will stop at nothing to escape, and Hoffman the somewhat apathetic submissive, who still has faith in institutionalization and society. Each escape attempt is more daring and elaborate than the last, and McQueen portrays wonderfully the vibrant human spirit forever in pursuit of his freedom. Hoffman too steals the show with each scene he is in, but it is McQueen that carries and envelopes the story with his relentless defiance. But the tale is not just a telling of a one dimensional, petty criminal. Throughout the film, Papillon is questioned certain existentialist ideas of what worth his life is, he who seeks to escape justice. The film leaves you with a nice moral to not waste your life, never painting the run for freedom with heroics or unnecessary romance. The script is very intelligent compared to the average prison film. Aside from the screenplay, the costume design, photography, make up, and on location shooting all provide wonderful colour and flair to the adventure. The story provides levels of imprisonment, until they are finally interred on the infamous Devil's Island that housed political prisoners, and the gradual wear and tear of their character and bodies is convincingly realized. You really get the sense that these guys have been through Hell for 20 or more years. You can feel the films influence on subsequent movies, from Shawshank Redemption, Cast Away, and even Apocalypse Now. The finale should go down in film history as a classic moment, filled with sadness, but always there remains a light of humanity that longs for autonomy. It is no surprise that Papillon means 'butterfly' in French, and the main character is probably the greatest libertarian hero in all of cinema, more so than any protagonist of Clint Eastwood or John Wayne. It isn't flawless, towards the middle it may drag a bit, but any self respecting film goer should watch this on the biggest television possible for the full effect. For such a great movie, it is somewhat under appreciated in today's age.",Papillon
103,mazec666,"""I'm still here you bastards!""",10,25 May 2012,"During the Steve McQueen phase of my young life, PAPILLON and THE GREAT ESCAPE were among the films that I've enjoyed watching numerous times.The similarity between the two is they are based partly on true events featuring larger-than-life personalities and the daring adventures that lie ahead. While the 1963 John Sturges classic had colorful characters and witty dialog, Franklin J. Schaffner's prison tale is the polar opposite of the latter film's breezy style.McQueen brings his signature ""King of Cool"" persona into Henri Charriere, the wrongfully convicted safe cracker who will never give up his personal freedom without a fight. Dustin Hoffman gives another winning performance as Louis Dega, a currency forger with an unlimited amount of cash hidden inside his intestines. Starring together for the first and final time, the two men have a particular goal of escaping the hellish, tropical South American penal colony known as Devil's Island.Having seen the original PLANET OF THE APES, Schaffner has a distinctive visual flair which makes him truly underrated as a director. While watching the opening scene in PAPILLON, one must feel the desperation that the prisoners are going through. Stripped of their belongings and nationality, the march around the streets of Paris (or in this case Madrid) is melancholy but at the same time mesmerizing. The film's combination of Old Hollywood epic storytelling with gritty New Hollywood filmmaking is nothing short of remarkable cinema.Despite seeing PAPILLON in all its widescreen glory on DVD, the picture quality is inferior but the 5.1 sound re-mix of Jerry Goldsmith's score is outstanding. Maybe if I get a Blu-ray player one day, the media book will be the first purchase.To quote the last line of the film, ""Hey you bastards, I'm still here.""",Papillon
104,amahlanand,The Glamorous Tale of Papillon,5,17 June 2012,"Numerous failed breakouts and re-captures, extended sufferings in prison and solitary, an eventual breakout that seems too spontaneous to work and a wild adventure involving scuffles with natives and the monstrous sea. No wonder why people question the authenticity of Henri Charriere's written account, it's an odyssey, but one that appears too glamorous to be believable and the film was no different. It was the story of a man rather than a group of men and his persistent escape attempts from prison but it ended up very lonesome because of this dearth of focus on the others. The relationship between some of the key characters was more an association rather than true camaraderie, lacking the depth and connection for genuine friendship. The film fails to connect you with these characters on a more emotional level which was important. On the outside, we see Steve McQueen, the gruff, seasoned American hero and Dustin Hoffman, the archetypal, sedate fraudster but little else about the characters of these men apart from what their actions have made them to be. At times, rather than a narrative of the two men, it came across as more analytic although in an unrevealing manner. Charriere, as personified by McQueen, has the endurance but lacks the indomitable human spirit which comes from more than just an ability to withstand uninhabitable conditions, mental torture and a few blotched escape attempts. This biopic felt like a recounting of Charriere's diary in many ways, such was how close we were brought to the character. But in this, we were made to re-live extended periods which were trivial, such as much of his uneventful, pitiable 2 year solitary period which became monotonous at times but intended to give viewers a more intense experience of his sufferings. Papillon's eventual escape and adventure fails to hold great surprises and twists, it becomes smooth sailing with a few hiccups along the way and that made the film seem extended unnecessarily. I would have liked it to be more bold, more thrilling and more unpredictable to the point where you could look at Papillon at the conclusion of the film and marvel at his experiences to that point. Not the case. There is plenty happening in 'Papillon' however, it isn't drab. But unlike one of its descendants, the lauded 'Shawshank Redemption', it lacks the connection with the audience to make them curious about the characters. Fact or fiction, Charriere's story has it's moments though.",Papillon
105,sixtwentysix,Madness and Redemption: He fought the law...,10,2 May 2004,"Dalton Trumbo's brutal tour of the life of Papillon a man sentenced to life in a French prison colony. This film is easily considered one of the ""godfathers"" of prison life movies. Every prison film after in recent memory borrows from this film and definitely not as successfully as this sprawling epic plays out.  Papillon is hell-bent on the concept of live free or die trying. In the same vein as Cool Hand Luke but definitely much, much darker. The film contains an interesting play on friendship, isolation, madness and how the three can mix when put to the ultimate survival test. A tough watch but well worth it if you can find something in the characters to connect with. Just appreciation of the odds they overcame simply living out the sentence was awe inspiring enough to me.Strange, hardcore, pitch dark and graphic tour of the mind (a Trumbo signature) this film constantly pushes you to the edge of your seat. You wonder where the dreams end and the hard reality begins. I definitely want to read the Henri Charrière novel now. This is all the film that the grossly overrated Shawshank Redemption endeavors to be. Shawshank reminds me of Papillon with more talk and less action. In fact, thinking about it further showed me just how devoid of originality (a Steven King signature) Shawshank was. If Papillon and Shawshank were cellmates, Shawshank would be the toothless prison punk getting sold for one cigarette.Never predictable and always original this film has more than enough action to make up for scenes that perhaps run a bit longer than needed. Painful in the bright sunshine this is a gritty voyage. Hoffman's character is sublime and understated allowing McQueen to shine and show you in this film why he was the top draw of the era. It was once said, the only true test of a great film is the test that time gives, Papillon passes with flying colors.The ULTIMATE prison escape movie. 9.5/10",Papillon

109,ignatz928,Beautiful but boring,5,8 January 2006,"If David Lean had directed Robert Bresson's austere prison-break film A Man Escaped, the results might have looked something like this. Papillon is made in the old epic mode of film-making that began sometime in the early 50s and was dying off by the seventies, when this film was made. For about its first hour I enjoyed the movie as a throwback to that vanished style, with the beautiful clarity of its widescreen photography and the attention to detail in its sets, costumes, and props. Franklin Schaffner's style, particularly in his meticulous widescreen compositions, is best described as monumental- he even he seems to prefer a monument's somber color range of , with lots of grays, whites and blues. He was heavily criticized at the time for handling what I really a fairly simple prison-break story in such grandiose fashion, but in his defense I think Schaffner is trying to show that one man's determination to reach freedom is an epic theme. As the film begins French prisoners are being taken away from their homeland to French Guiana. Papillon (Steve McQueen), a safecracker convicted of killing a pimp (a crime that he insists he is innocent of), befriends Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman), who, though a notorious safecracker, has no chance of survival on his own; Papillon provides protection for him, first on the sea journey to the colony, and then in the fetid swamps where they're put to work. The film's meticulous recreations of the story's setting and locations really pay off here in conveying the characters' harsh environment, a nightmare world in which convicts are brutalized for the slightest infraction, are forced by guards to kill crocodiles, and are hunted by professional ""manhunters"" through the jungles if they attempt to escape. Steve McQueen was not much of an actor in the sense of someone who slips into a character's skin, but in the right role his presence could tell you everything you need to know about a character. One of the basic characteristics of McQueen's characters is that they refuse to be hemmed in by any form of authority, and here he holds the movie together because you know that Papillon will stop at nothing to escape. If the movie had continued in the vein of its first hour it might now be remembered as a great adventure film. It starts to go downhill, however, after Papillon is condemned to solitary confinement. The sequence that follows is like a grim variation on McQueen's similar scenes in The Great Escape, and really it's much too grim for a Steve McQueen movie. There's plenty of brutality in the earlier scenes, but there it's in an adventure movie format that the movie can support, and there's plenty of detail and spectacle to balance out the central story's narrow focus. In the solitary confinement scenes, however, all you have to look at is Steve McQueen locked into a tiny prison cell, and the hollowness of the movie's self-seriousness is exposed. These scenes are also the most similar to A Man Escaped, which only shows up the inherent flaws of Papillon, a film with infinitely more resources than Bresson had and far fewer ideas about what to do with them. Papillon never recovers from what this sequence, even the film returns to familiar escape-movie ground more suited to Schaffner's talents and McQueen's personality. Papillon's escape from the island is well executed technically, but by treating it like the ""Greatest Story Ever Told,"" Schaffner saps these scenes of any sense of exhilaration. Even worse, Papillon's success in escaping depends on way too many contrived details for it ever to be taken as seriously as the director intends. It's almost like a fairytale, with Papillon running into people every step of the way who are improbably willing to help him. Old time epics, for all of their proud claims of accuracy in even the minutest details, sometimes founder on the little details. The American accents of Papillon's cast produces a disassociated feel, as if Americans had replaced all of the French characters and were carrying on in their place. Another lapse is the puzzlingly sloppy makeup job on the leader of a leper colony that Papillon encounters, which in a daytime scene can be seen to only cover part of his face. The screenplay's decision to have Papillon be recaptured after he seems to have been home free for a while is a bold decision, particularly since his betrayer is a nun (!), but it also means that the last half hour is completely perfunctory, since we know that he will escape again, successfully this time, at the end of the movie, leaving us with nothing to watch except Steve McQueen trying to out-act Dustin Hoffman, not exactly his forte as a performer. It's in the last shot, however, where the movie really shoots itself in the foot; as Papillon drifts away from the island on a raft, supposedly alone in the middle of the ocean, I could see, very clearly, a frogman under the raft. At the end of what was obviously a very expensive movie to make, this gaffe isn't just embarrassing, it's mind-boggling that the filmmakers would effectively throw all of their effort in a few seconds. In terms of escape movies, Papillon straddles the line between a serious art-house film like A Man Escaped and a 1960s Hollywood guys-on-a-mission action flick like The Great Escape, but the film is too solemn and narrowly focused to capture the exuberance of the latter, and too much of a movie star-fuelled spectacle to capture the real seriousness of the former. By the movie's end, what began as a compelling adventure movie can be summed up in three words: beautiful but boring.",Papillon

113,KMM,A Classic Prison Escape Film,10,22 March 2002,"Franklin J. Schaffner felt that the obligation of motion pictures is to entertain, it's as basic as that, and that is exactly what Papillon does. It is also a movie that really triggers your emotions from start to finish. I feel this is one of Steve McQueen's best acting roles. It was probably the most physically demanding and emotionally challenging role of his career. Dustin Hoffman is simply magnificent as Louis Dega, a role that demonstrates how versatile the actor really can be. It eventually earned him a best supporting actor nomination. Unfortunately, McQueen was overlooked by the Academy that year.  Another example of their stupidity!!
The film is emotionally draining, but I find myself watching this film time and time again because of its portrayal of one man's quest to gain his freedom no matter what it takes.  Freedom always comes at a price. It is not something that is handed to us or exists freely. It must be earned and that is exactly what his character does by the time the credits role on this film. The viewer will not believe what the character of Papillon had to endure to gain his freedom. The trials he goes through are unforgettable and often left me wondering if I would persevere if I had to undergo the trials he faced. For me, Steve McQueen is one of those actors who really has a great on screen presence. I will almost always watch a movie just because he appears in it, good or bad. Papillon is no exception. Although Papillon is a character driven film, the movie must be viewed for more than just the characters. It also has wonderful cinematography, direction and a memorable, and at times haunting, musical score by Jerry Goldsmith. It is right up there with the best of the prison escape films.  Henri Charrière, the real life Papillon and author of the novel, talked about society and his real life experiences in this way:
""Society does not want free men. They talk freedom, democracy, anything you want, but they do not want free men. Society wants conditioned men, men who march in step."" It's up to the viewer to agree or disagree with that statement while viewing the film.I highly recommend you watch this film today!",Papillon

But since it has to be relegated to the small screen, the acting is so good that it more than makes up for the loss of the big screen.  The only criticism I have is that, after reading the book, I learned that Mr. Charrieire, (I apologize for the possible misspelling) was not as nice a character as Steve McQueen made him seem, though he may have been innocent of the murder charge that sent him to Devil's Island, but I guess it's Hollywood's job to make people nicer than they might otherwise be.

115,MisterChandu,Hollywood Phoniness: A fool and his money!,1,18 October 2009,"Henri Charriere? Who's he? This movie is about Steve McQueen! Devils' Island? Where's that? This movie is about Hollywood! I saw this film way back when in a time where Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman were at the height of their popularity. McQueen was the typical ""good looking"" lead while Hoffman was part of the new wave of ""serious"" actors. Frankly this was all fluff and this film stands out as a example of popular reputations polluting a interesting subject for a film.Devils Island had been used by Hollywood as a setting in melodramatic plots not much unlike other prison films. Although his story is based on fact and has tried to bring some more gritty reality to the story, it is still a Hollywood formula film where the looking for respect ""actor"" but really movie star McQueen is paired with the a new wave (for the time) respectable actor but really movie star wannabe Dustin Hoffman to give it commercial appeal.McQueen's casting works somewhat he having a tough guy image but Hoffman's casting, again I think meant to make McQueen look good, looks sillier every day. He is just too light to be doing this part, a part someone like Edward G. Robinson would have been perfect for in his prime. Time and social changes has betrayed the phoniness of the late 60's Auteur directing and method acting as some kind of a religion school of thought. McQueen's movie star charisma has held up much better because it was a integral part of him. ""Little Big Man"" Hoffman's later roles such as as ""Tootsie"" just makes him a joke as in most famous Hollywood expression of them all: ""There's ten dollars I'll never see again."" My favorite part of the movie is when McQueen is in solitary and he tries to stop from going crazy.I will not go crazy! I will not go crazy! I crazy will not go! Go crazy I will not! Not crazy go not I! I wonder if the audience was as successful? By the way, how do I look? Did the warden ever keep pet mocking birds? I've got such a lovely bunch of coconuts!In short, McQueen and Hoffman try hard but the movie is just too long.Of course the biggest bunch of phonies at the time were the audience of pretentious message film as art of intellectual wannabes sitting in the cinema. A generation of baby boomer's once removed from European peasants holding City College degrees lording over the universe. Lure these self important phonies in and be pseudo socially relevant all the way to the bank. Sounds like a formula for a death camp movie, not Devils Island.In other words. like seeing oneself in some home camcorder production from the 70's, this film has aged as well as canned mystery meat at best.So there!",Papillon
116,Chromium_five,Flawed but fantastic,9,16 October 2007,"""Papillon"" is a tiring but highly entertaining film that I am rating higher than it deserves for a specific reason. It's not perfect; it has many flaws that have already been explained in other comments, one of the main one being that the story is so vast, a standard feature film can hardly do it justice (it would have worked better as a miniseries). However, I can forgive all that and more, because this film contains a scene that left such an impression on me, I am sure it will be in the back of my mind for as long as I live. I am referring of course to the scene where Papillon is sent to solitary confinement for two years. It's only 25 minutes long in real time, but it's one of the most gripping and harrowing sequences I have ever seen. Papillon is enclosed in a tiny box, five paces across, no windows, high ceiling, constantly monitored by guards, and is not allowed to make the slightest noise. Without revealing too much, his resolution to get through the two years without trouble goes wrong early on, and the warden does everything he can to push him into total insanity. The fantastic suspense that follows is unmatched by almost any psychological horror film.McQueen starred in ""An Enemy of the People"" a few years later, supposedly to prove that he could act in a straight drama, but he didn't need to. His performance in these 25 minutes is wonderful as he transforms from a quiet, confident man to a mumbling maniac. The elaborate makeup certainly helps, but the desperation in his eyes and voice is all genuine. There is no need to doubt: the man could act.It's not the only memorable scene; there are many, but it's the most impressive. It's helped by Schaffner's intense direction, injecting more and more tension into each scene until it reaches heart-attack levels in the confinement sequence. The film's dialogue is also quite intelligent and quotable, moreso than in most prison films. The whole thing is a bit of chore to get through, but the scenes of human will beating the odds make it all worth it. 9/10.",Papillon

Without the clear story line of the first part of the movie, all kinds of things happen without much of an explanation.

The movie is part drama, part fantasy, part action. At its heart it is about friendship and the power of the human spirit. Steve McQueen is fabulous as Papillon, a petty thief who is falsely imprisoned for murder. The conditions of the prison in French Guiana are abhorrent. From the beginning, Papillon attaches himself to Louis Dega and becomes both friend and protector. This friendship ultimately leads to solitary confinement for Papillon. At some point in the movie, you forget McQueen is even acting--he really seems to become the character. No matter how hard they try to break his spirit, Papillon is determined to escape and reach freedom at all costs.

124,heero_yuy2,possibly the original Shawshank Redemption,8,20 August 2005,"Papillon is the character played by Steve McQueen. Convicted with life sentence for accursedly killing a young girl, he was transferred to St. Laurent's penal colony of France along with his colleagues of prisoners, where he met Dustin Hoffman, a counterfeiter, and several other inmates and marshalls of different aspects. His motivation to escape the colony led others to follow his trail, and ends up being put in rationed reclusion for every attempt he do...and still survives time.Although McQueen seemed to be worn out of his ""escape"" role here, the character role's vital strength of courage amidst the very rough penalties given makes this movie worth watching. Added by the ""feeling"" style of the reclusion and the seemingly endless integrity with his fellow inmate Hoffman, now you will be impressed with this movie. The only flaws were...he escapes too long and still end up...whatever. Also, the other flaw was the whole tribal meeting that seemed worthless in the movie. But, hey! It still has the lesson that's note worthily same with the Shawshank Redemption: courage and hope.You might had read this comment or the title I summarized for it, but I recommend you watch it and find why I said it the much more original Shawshank Redemption.",Papillon
125,dozer200,The Best Prison Movie Ever Made,10,19 November 2001,This movie is by far one of the most underrated movies ever made. I am assuming that not enough people had seen this movie. Unfortunately it was over shadowed by other classics such as The Sting and American Graffiti which I thought both were not nearly as good as this one. Steve McQueen's performance was by far one of his best. It is because of this movie i began to really enjoy McQueen as an actor. Dustin Hoffman plays a great supporting role and it is by far one of his best performances as well. This movie should be rated over movies like The Shawshank Redemption which i felt was a bit too overrated. Papillon had a much better story line and it has you on the edge of you seat the whole time unlike Shawshank which isnt a bad movie but not nearly as good. I would have to recommend this to prison/escape movie buffs because this one is by far the best. Lets give credit where credit is due!!!!!!!,Papillon
126,bengt_historiska,"The film is much too long, and lacks the continuity of the book.",7,21 February 2001,"The famous novel, which this film is based on, was a big best-seller when it was released. Hollywood, of course, was immediately there and realized, that this was something that you could make a movie out of. Despite good performances by the leading men, the film is much too long, and lacks the dramatic continuity of the book. The music, though, by Jerry Goldsmith and the cinematography by Fred J.Koenekamp are both excellent. A little more French influence on the making of this movie would probably have increased its authenticity.",Papillon
127,zxgerard,Uncredited music for PAPILLON,10,31 January 2008,"The music score of Jerry Golsmith for PAPILLON is great. However, I didn't find a very important part : in the movie, during the 2nd escape of Papillon with Maturette and Clusiot, the prison's orchestra plays a music...I've always wanted to know what was this music, because I found it very appropriate with the action. I supposed it was ""classical music"" since it was not on the official score of Jerry Goldsmith. But I didn't find it in the credits either, so I made my own search and I found it ! It was ""FAUST"" composed by Charles GOUNOD in 1859....",Papillon
128,cmp4x,Pure ideology,1,30 August 2018,"I can see why this movie is so popular, and this is why it deserves no praise. It is the kind of easy-to-digest story that is a basic allegory of straight male capitalism, and therefore it is exactly in line with ""normal"" ideology. The ""hero"" (Steve McQueen) against all odds wins his freedom from a harsh prison colony in the islands. He has to accomplish this by a series of clever plots and exploits. It is exactly analogous to the way one would innovate, struggle, and push all the boundaries to succeed in a market, except in this case ""success"" in the market equates to gaining freedom from prison at all costs. On the other hand, there is an interesting subtext in the movie having to do with homosocial affection between men - there is even a gay character who offers the way out, quite something for 1973! At one point, the possibility is raised that rather than struggle for this type of ""freedom"" they might develop true friendships, and their life in the all-male prison caring for one another starts to actually seem kinda ""gay."" But the main character in the end forsakes his ""friends"" for the solitude of freedom and ""success."" I think it would have been more interesting had the director explored how they might have grown to accept their fate in the prison, nonetheless developing a rich set of affections that made it irrelevant if they were ""free"" or not.The other thing is that once he gains his elusive freedom, we only learn about it from a voice-over in the closing moments of the film, and no visualization of this sought-after state is provided. Despite the large amount of evidence from what we ARE shown that life can have satisfying moments of friendship and even interest - despite being in prison - the ultimate goal is left completely unpictured as a myth or fantasy. This is ideology at its purest. Maybe for distilling ideology so perfectly this film deserves more credit? Nah.",Papillon
129,tmaria1,A great movie,9,9 March 2019,I just do not understand the bad reviews this movie gets. I thought it was a great story. It was definitely well shot and for me had enough action and suspense to keep me interested. I see so many critics complaining that they didnt care about the characters? Why? Is it because they are not flawless? Please see this movie...it is rare that you will see another of its calibre again.,Papillon
130,Mythicalreviewer,A little too Fantastic to believe,7,8 March 2006,"*** WARNING **** SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! After watching the movie for the first time last night my opinion is that some of the plot was just too unbelievable.I find it hard to believe that Papillon escapes for the 2nd time and finds the manhunters, that were tipped off beforehand, to be murdered and he is befriended by some stranger.And then goes to a leper colony and is befriended by the lepers and given a boat.And then is befriended by a honduras national once he reaches the mainland. But wait the honduran national is killed and Papillon is captured by the tribe that was sent to track him down.And then Papillon is befriended by the tribesmen but no wait.... he is turned in by some nuns at a convent.Papillon is then put on ""devils"" island which is escape proof but wait... he puts some coconuts in a bag, throws it off a cliff, and floats on the coconuts for 23 miles to the mainland and lives a free man.Yeah.......sure.......And all prisoners are innocent are they? If this was labeled as a fantasy film I would have given it a 9 for the acting.I don't believe half of the film really happened.",Papillon

But when you close your eyes,
A refrain that talks to you in slang,
Dance your happy days,
With the smell of the metro,
Everyone escapes in his own way,
Everyone's dream is butterfly,You who are looking at the sea
You do not even see the horizon
You look twenty years back
And it's far, and it's good
Paris exists always
And when spring comes, you can see
The thugs stroll around
Chestnut trees in the boulevards
Eyes fixed on a petticoatRemember ButterflyYou who are looking at the sky
You are no more than a poor man crushed
Overwhelmed by the weight of the sun
By the weight of the past

132,pazza-mourinho,what a great movie .. Steve McQeen's unforgettable fabulous performance,10,23 July 2010,"I have really a great joy watching this masterpiece .. this movie is taking us to depths of the humanity and the human psyche . Many aspects of the human psyche are shown all the way from the beginning till the end . Steve McQueen performed a great complicated dramatic structured character which will take the leading role and the whole movie to higher levels . After seeing this movie we are going to learn for how much long we can go through troubles in our lives and how strong our volition is . May be its a bit long (2:30) but every time you are going to feel a little boring there is something arise to refresh and give a new whiff . Desert Dream scene and the dialog within is one of the best scenes I ever watch in cinema especially its accompanied by a great sensitive main-theme soundtrack that will stick in our memory for very long time . Steve McQueen "" Papillon "" performance in the reclusion cell was really amazingly wonderful and touches me strongly . Dustin Hoffman also played very sharply his character as "" Dega "" and he quite the contrary of 'Papi' represents the unsure-feared peaceful man who is looking for certain things and has no bold in the escaping attempts , and this is one of the most attracting aspects in the whole movie . At the end we should learn that "" Hope "" matters a lot in our life and without it we have no humanity .",Papillon
133,lancaster2778,A bit long but loaded with talent!,8,24 June 2004,"I saw this movie for the first time a couple of months ago. What can I say; I'm a bit slow. In my opinion, Steve McQueen sparkled in every movie he ever did. We all lost a great one when he left us. He plays Papillon with much humility and courage. Dustin Hoffman is loaded with talent in this one. I must say, though, that Anthony Zerbe's performance as the leper is outstanding. The humility Zerbe emotes (without saying a word and with half his face hidden under a disguise) when McQueen thanks him for his help took my breath away. The entire cast is first-rate. The only negative thing I have to say about the film--I thought it is a bit long. As I said, the entire cast is first-rate, even though, at times, the film lags just a bit. Wonderful location shooting. Oh, and one more thing-- William Smithers rocks out loud in this gem of a movie!",Papillon

I recently watched it again on cable and after going thru the part where Papillon was stuck in solidary for 2 years I couldn't believe he didn't get nominated for the Oscar. He more than deserved it. He did get nominated for a few other awards but only that. The man was brilliant and we lost him much too some.
I haven't read the book but after reading one of the reviews here, I do plan to.

Probably the best performance both Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman have ever given in a film enthused with absorbing detail in every scene, not only of the harshness of Devil's Island but of the psychological impact on the main players and the injustice and cruelty of the life sentences. It works on two levels - psychological and emotional whilst at the same time tells an exciting and dramatic story of escape. It's riveting cinema that went unrewarded by critics - shame on them. Thankfully its proved amongst the public to be an enduring classic.",Papillon
136,btg-777-11995,"Great long prison escape story for an ""old movie"" night. Two great actors at their best.",10,6 September 2013,"Papillion is one of those movies that balances a strong protagonist with a story that includes quality performances from other fine supporting actors. Namely, Steve McQueen is at his best with Dustin Hoffman aptly fitting in as best friend and others such as Bill Mummy and Don Gordon.One of the most engaging features of such a protagonist in a movie or book is the theme of ""wrongly convicted""-which is certainly present here. While we never know for sure, Papillion made convincing arguments that he was innocent and his resolve throughout his life story seems to gain energy from them. His will to survive and be free is strong but is it possibly strong enough to overcome fate? The story twists and turns from France to the jungles of French Guiana to an infamous Caribbean island ""Devil's Island"" with many adventures and escape attempts well tied to the main plot.One must remember, when criticizing this movie, that it is a true story...well at least 75% true according to Henri Charrière (aka Papillion). Be critical of the plot but remember that this actually happened and to add embellishments must be done with discernment! I liked it all and have deemed it one of my very favorites.",Papillon
137,Piraatje,"A man is wrongly accused of murder and sent to the penal colony in French Guiana, but he's not about to give up!",7,23 November 2000,"As you know, ""Papillon"" is based on a novel with the same name. If you first read the novel and watch the film afterwards, you're a bit disappointed (at least I was). First of all, a lot of the sequences of the novel are simply left out in the film. But I can't blame the two screenwriters for that. The novel's over 500 pages and you just have to leave things out if you want to make a film of a respectable length (it still lasts two and a half hours!). Secondly, the chronological order of events as we see them in the film, is different from the order in the novel. The screenwriters also gave Déga a much larger role in the film than in the novel -and that's my third point. My opinion on that is that they did it to make the film a bit more emotional and to create an opposite between Papillon and Déga, who are two completely different characters. As an adventure-film, ""Papillon"" is certainly worth watching. I also discovered Steve McQueen by watching this film! I'm only 21 years old and I hadn't seen any of his films before. I've seen a few of them now and he really was a great actor. Too bad he had to die so young. Dustin Hoffman's magnificent as well as Déga, but that he is in most of his films. The book's worth reading too, by the way.",Papillon

Two great actors Dustin Hoffman and Steve McQueen are able to present you disappointment, happiness, loyalty, patience, hope, insanity, friendship and depression perfectly. Every single scene in the picture has a lot of things to say to you. You might get emotionally confused when watching this movie, you might even sense a little bit of friendship or love between the prison guardians and the prisoners and at the same time you might be able to sense the unreasonable hate. When you are not free, then you have nothing else to lose thus you have to run after your freedom, however do not believe in freedom until you get what you used to have before losing it.",Papillon

Honestly, in Papillon at the age of 36 he looks the same as in Rain Man at a tender age of 51.Anyway, I tentatively rented this film being a fan of both actors but having not previously heard any comments regarding it.  Yes it was a harrowing account (be it true or not) of Henri Charriere's desperate attempts for freedom.  But I found it to be just as humorous as it was dramatic.  I mean 5 years, in solitary!?  Nice touch with the white hair and the permanent walking-defect.  When he emerged from solitary the second time he was confronted with the death of his friend.  Nice touch!  I can see the humor on the guards part (and after all it may well have been 5 years to the day that they were both caught on the run, so fair enough!), but for his friend to die just as he was released.....rather unfortunate after 2000+ days in solitary!

I couldnt stop watching and suffering along with the two protagonists, performed by McQueen and Hoffman. They both are superb in this saga of prisoners in penal colonies of French Guyana. I couldnt hold my tears during several scenes, but thats not the only criterion for my judgement.The secret of this European-style masterpiese is its silence and patience. So when I saw it not appearing in the top 250 movies of this database, the American audience seems to prefer fast and dramatic movies. For Dustin Hoffman it is only one of many fine performances, but for Steve McQueen this is a real highlight as a serious actor. One thing I ve got to say in addition: To me it means a kind of wonder, how the director gets to feel physically the abnormal heat at the different locations in South America.

There he befriends a fellow inmate and together with a few other inmates they plot an escape.First of all, Steve McQueen is fantastic as Papillon. You root for him along the film and hope he manages to escape. The chemistry between the McQueen and Hoffman is terrific. The cinematography is topnotch in delivering the harsh setting making you feel like you have been in prison along with the characters.I only had a few problems with the film. One of them involves a scene of solitary. I found that scene to be a tad too long. I understand why the director chose to elongate the scene since he wants to show how lonely and dreadful it is to be trapped in solitary. Unfortunately, I found it to drag a little and think it could be slightly shorter. My other problem is the 30 minutes before the finale, I think that the pacing for those 30 minutes was a little off, some scenes seem to unfold so fast it took me a few seconds to understand what happened. Other than that this was a great movie. I will definitely buy this and add this to my blu-ray collection. A 8/10.Now I can finally watch the remake and hopefully Hollywood doesn't ruin it.",Papillon

Steve McQueen gives the finest performance of his too short career in this most exciting tale of survival. This is the true story of Henre Charier, nicknamed Papillon, who was sentenced to a long term at Devil's Island in French Guianna.  The movie deals with the many attempts at escape that Papillon executes.  Dustin Hoffman gives a fantastic performance (as usual) as Papillon's fellow convict and friend Louis Dega.  The chemistry between McQueen and Hoffman is nothing short of magic. Directed by Frank Schaffner (Patton, Planet of the Apes), this is a most compelling and edge-of-your-seat entertainment.

If you enjoy the movies of  either of these two actors, then I wholeheartedly suggest that you see this movie. The story is one about the human condition where the character Papillion (McQueen) refuses to stay locked up in a cell for even moment longer than he has to in the desolate jungles of the carrabien. Together, Papillion and his good friend Dega (Hoffman) travel great lengths across the Atlantic Ocean and islands of exile in search and hope of freedom. Will they ever be free?

This is an absolutely breathtaking film about 'Papilon', a man who is falsely accused of murder and sent to 'devils island'. Steve Mqueen is truly awesome as the lead. Alongside Dustin Hoffman, Mqueen breaks out of the prison and sets out on an a journey to freedom. Dustin Hoffman is great, but it is really Mqueen's powerful performance which really steals the show. The escape is portrayed with as much action as possible, and is some times tragic at times.

157,electric_sunrise,"""Hey you bastards, Papillon's still here!""",9,29 January 2015,"This movie doesn't give you a moment to settle down. Drums beat. Prisoners are assembled under a blazing sun and informed that they are being packed and sent for the rest of their lives to the penal colony at Devil's Island, French Guinea. France has disowned them. Among the prisoners is the titular character Papillon (aced by Steve McQueen) charged with a crime he hasn't committed, and Luis Dega (Hoffman), a fraud banker convicted on counterfeit charges. Bound by mutual necessity, they soon become friends during their journey to Devil's Island. Then begins a ruthless documentation of inhuman prison conditions in that infamous penal colony that has shamed French history forever. The movie is based on a book by the same name authored by Henri Charriere, a former convict and fugitive from Devil's Island and though the work is fiction, the background is entirely based on real events.As soon as Papillon declares his intention to flee this place to Dega, we are with him! And why not - the harrowing surrealism with which prison life at Devil's Island is depicted makes us grateful to afford our daily cup of coffee. Not surprising because the greatest prison movies have the power to nurture a sense of gratitude in us - that simply of being alive and free. Papillon is right up there with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in that regard, and there are scenes toward the end of the movie where McQueen's character behaves as hysterical and looks almost identical to Tim Robbin's Andy Dufresne.However, the movie is also different from ""Shawshank"" in that it transcends the prison genre, occasionally yielding to levels of adventures expected in Indiana Jones or Monte Cristo. But the tension running through the movie is palpable; we find ourselves repeatedly cheering the poetic heroism of Papillon and his ""never-say-die"" attitude through the film; yet a part of us knows and feels the attempt is futile; that iron bars and grim walls of hard stone can break down any man's will; and even if you get past those obstacles through luck or friends, there is only a vast, endless ocean to conquer. Repeatedly we fail to offer him our trust, repeatedly he defies us by the strength of his being, till it all ends as a matter of choice in the brink of incertitude. Papillon finally finishes on a high note, with McQueen screaming ""Hey you bastards, I'm still here!"" This movie is also a great study of contrasting approaches to life. A life led by courage and a life led by cunning are not the same. Where Papillon always has his heart in the front, Dega the ""friend"" he earnestly trusts has his mind. There is a moment in the film where Papillon suffers much on account of a move by Dega, but he doesn't give his friend's name away to the officials. During such moments, we almost wish he were as practical as Dega, but we are reminded that a man of courage like Papillon can never be Dega. Nor can Dega ever be a Papillon. Yet, through the course of this movie, Dega transforms in his understanding of ""the heroic man"" and acknowledges that such men exist. In the breakdown of Dega's cynicism during the final hysterical scenes laced with black comedy and the gruff, raw editing that somehow suits and runs through the length of this movie; we know Papillon has triumphed and whether he live or die in the story, this movie will gloriously live on an island all its own!And inspire.

It's interesting the things I have actually learned by reading the book from the beauty of everything Papillon was trying to accomplish to survival skills. The movie does not capture really any of that. He didn't go 'mad' while in solitary he actually survived by mentally taking 'trips' to his beautiful past memories. He was also a vey charming man that could get anyone to do anything he wanted but he never had malicious intent. His multiple escapes and detailed tellings really make me believe he actually did all of this and did actually escape from Devils Island but the political system of his country denied everything because they look bad if this story is true.,Papillon
161,Shrike-3,We really WANT Papillon to escape!,9,8 November 1998,"Steve McQueen is fantastic in the title role of this biographical movie about one man's struggle to escape French justice.  Papillon is a petty thief, framed for murder, and finds himself sentenced to life imprisonment in a prison in French Guyana.  His unbelievably strong will and determination to be free of these unjust chains, drives him to attempt escape after escape.  Long periods in solitary do nothing to reduce his character.  He leaves the authorities no choice but to send him to Devils Island, a place from where there is no escape except to the cruel surrounding ocean.The movie is very moving as we follow Papillon through the years and we can do nothing but admire the man for never losing sight of who is he and where he wants to be - free!  McQueen has never been better and there is strong support from Dustin Hoffman has a fellow prisoner whom Papillon befriends. The film is two and a half hours but they fly by, which is more than can be said for Papillon's sentence.  We really WANT him to succeed and as the credits roll you will be left with a hopeful smile on your face.",Papillon

163,No Never-2,the dull side of freedom,5,21 July 1999,"The dubiously factual true story of Devil's Island prisoners attempting to break out, ""Papillon"" is concerned with the same themes of most prison films: freedom, humanity, the indestructible human spirit, etc..  All fine and good, as the glibly entertaining ""The Shawshank Redemption"" proved, but Franklin Schaffner's film is undone by narrative formlessness (the movie was made up as they went along and it shows), overlength, clumsy direction, and unforgivably hambone acting by Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.  The half-baked brand of ""visceral"" showmanship displayed here would be done much better in ""Midnight Express"" and countless other superior prison films.",Papillon

165,waestrem,I'm still here - after all these years...,10,19 June 2004,"I have enjoyed watching this film several times over the three decades since it was released. Yes, it certainly is a tragic and gruesome story of how brutal mankind can be, but more importantly, it is an inspiring story of resilience and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity. I often think of the closing scene where Papillon floats away from the prison island on his raft of coconuts. This was truly my favorite of all of Steve McQueen's films. Dustin Hoffman's performance foretold the depth and richness of his acting abilities. I highly recommend this film. It is a timeless classic.",Papillon

The Xtabi caves were also the scene of another famous movie (20,0000 Leagues Under the Sea). Director Frank Schaffner was friends with Richard Fleischer, who directed 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and was impressed with the footage shot by Fleischer at Xtabi. Schaffner remembered the raw, unspoiled natural beauty of the Xtabi cove and had his Director of Photography, Fred Koenekamp, scout the location for the Papillon film. The hotel itself was originally built to accommodate the cast and crew who spent several weeks in pre-production preparing the caves and eventually shooting the scenes, which took just over a week. Steve McQueen insisted that a bar be constructed on the Xtabi cliffs for the cast and crew(which is still there today).",Papillon
167,tonceamihai,Not even a small piece of reality,4,7 December 2007,"Probably the worst movie i've ever seen.If you want to know the true story of Papillon READ THE BOOK!!! Here are some reasons why this movie is so bad :1. The script twists the original book in a freaking manner. The 1st escape takes place before Papi reaches the detention island , he escapes from the prison with Maturette and CLOUSIOT not with Dega which is to scared to escape and does not help them in any manner, the escape scene is partial true , there was no party and no guard was so close to raise the alarm like in the movie. BUT in the movie before the escape him and Dega go in woodcutting camp that's not true , Papillon went in the woodcutting camp with Clousiot AFTER THEY GOT CAUGHT, after Papillon escapes with ANtonio ,the guy who speaks Spanish, from a Colombian prison. 2. Apart of changing the initial chapter order they miss a lot of them to, the Conciergerie chapter is not even mentioned and it has a vital role in comprehending the idea of the book. MOST IMPORTANT PART THAT HAS BEEN CUT IS THE TRIAL AND THE DREAMS OF REVENGE THAT KEEP PAPILLON GOING THOSE ARE Extremely IMPORTANT and you realize that after reading the book .3. Hollywood style is doing marvels :)). Papillon had no butterfly tattooed on his chest he had a tiger tattooed on the chest and he tattoos the Indian chief with a tiger not a butterfly. Also DEGA is not an important character of the book he appears in the Conciergerie Chapter, the travel to Guyana and at Papillon's 1st solitary detention.CONCLUSION : They ruined a marvelous book doing a very bad movie.",Papillon
168,doc_hollywood14,Too freaking Long,5,10 August 2003,"The first half of this movie was brilliant. It was great. Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman both gave extraordinary performances throughout the film, but it died at the half-way point. They should have ended it after they escaped the first time. That would have been fine. But they kept it going throughout and made it stupid. Introducing cubans and natives on the island, nuns who turned him back to authorities. One thing that really got me was that when they landed on the island, they dropped Dego (Hoffman) and ran. We don't know how he got off the Island or how he ended up back at the prison. Now I know that the movie is based on the book and if that was the case, they should have shortened parts in the movie. Like McQueen on the island running, or when he was serving time in the cooler. Overall, the first half was great and the performances were exceptional, but it was too long. I give it a **1/2 out of *****.",Papillon
169,juawand,An excellent tale of misery & freedom,10,17 September 2008,"This is one of the best pieces of creative work. What makes this movie even more powerful is the fact that it is based on truth. It makes one realize how lucky one is to be born free and live & breath in environment where there are no shackles. It instills in you the love for free world where one is born and where life runs and smiles and where humanity prevails over the anguish & pain of inhuman torturous places like Devils Island. We must learn to love our freedom while we still have it. The movie portrays the horrors of solitary excellently and of all the worst things that a human may do to the other, i think solitary lies at the lowest level of humanity. You can feel it through, the unbearable distress of solitary confinement and how it cripples all you ability to think and believe. I think Mcqueen was excellent there. I recommend this for all those who have the desire to understand the urge of running from a hell like devils island and back into the world, our world!",Papillon

171,roosevelthertz,The Rise and Fall of Humanity,7,18 November 2010,"Papillon was one those films that gets better and better as it progresses. This is while i liked and could identify myself with Louis and ""Papillon"" the longer i got into the film. The nice thing about this was that these two very different men, discovered humanity in a very inhumane place, and what started to be a deal to survive the harsh prison evolved into a very strong bond and friendship, a friendship that defines and reflects the beauty of this movie. The nice things about this film wasn't the man-eating sharks, man-hunters, the native Indians or Papillons epic escape thus again returning to the prison. Most of these things where pretty stupid and cliché. Instead it was the beauty of their friendship, and how they would help each others through the whole film. Actions that almost cost them their lives several times. It is this sincerity that makes the film worth watching. Another important point in this film was how Papillon and Louis would have to lay their lives in the hands of people that they had no reason to trust and then getting deceived by people taking advantage of their desperate situation. This made Papillon and Louis, including myself, lose belief in humanity. But amongst all these villains and unscrupulous people there are people who are willing to help only because they are good people. Human. The man in the forest, the lepers the Indians and so on. All of the outcast, the people no one normally would trust, seems to be more human than the ""civilised"" french guards. It really suits the film to both tear down man while at the same time exalting him. This gives the film a much more harmonized and varied picture as well as being a good point. I also liked Papillons repetitive attempts to escape in the sense that even when he got to the retirement island he would plan an escape. Not because it looked possible, but because he simply have to keeping seeking the freedom that has been taken from him. And only because of this way of thinking he was actually lucky to escape at the end whereas Louis, who didn't work as hard for freedom as Papillon therefore never achieved. If you want to achieve anything in life you will have to keep on trying till it happens and never give up and if you do that there will be gold at the end of rainbow. All in all Papillon is a film worth watching because of its good acting and dialogue between the two protagonist and it's message and typical carpe-diem-courage-dog-bad-***-************-attitude.",Papillon

Dustin Hoffman is at his finest as Louie Dega. Very memorable, unforgettable performances, shocking action scenes and psychological thrills and twists. I cannot write enough good things about this film. After years of looking, I recently found this film on DVD and added it to my collection. This is the kind of movie that you can watch again and again and continue to see things you've never noticed before. This film never gets old and you never grow tired of watching Papillon. Some of the cast includes Vic Tayback also known as Mel from the hit TV series ""Alice."" He is convincing as a mean, surly prison guard. Also, Billy Tumy known for his role in ""Lost in Space"" as Will Robinson, plays a young, doomed inmate. There are other character actors included in the cast that you will more than likely recognize throughout the film. I give this film the strongest and highest of recommendations.",Papillon

It's shot beautifully and there's really no reason to make it again. It's not like it's a silent film or in black and white, or was poorly acted. It's Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman at their best for Christ's sake. And a screenplay by Dalton Trumbo. What more could you want?I must have watched this film 10 times back when it came out and for the following few years after, and I just went back to view it again. I've always said, as so many others in these User Reviews have stated, this is one of the most underrated Hollywood films in the history of cinema. Franklin Schaffer was at his best. He didn't nominated for an Oscar and nor did the film. What an oversight. It's one of McQueen's best performances ever, and that's saying a lot. He got a Golden Globe nomination but no Oscar nomination.

Steve McQueen, in my mind, knows instinctively how to play the quintessential hero (as seen previously in The Great Escape). But, the movie doesn't ride completely on his performance. Dustin Hoffman seems almost typecast for his weak genius role, and the cinematography is breathtakingly brilliant and brutal at the same time. Not to slight the rest of the movie, but the long scene of Papillion in solitary confinement is so well-executed, in my opinion is one of the greatest scenes in cinematic history.",Papillon

So much in fact that I decided to read the book by Henri Charrière, which I would strongly recommend to all who liked the film.The film stops where the book goes much further, and Papillon has many more troubles and adventures to overcome before the story ends. Another example of the many things that was changed in the film; Louis Dega (played by Dustin Hoffman) only plays a minor role in the Book, and is never sent to Devil's Island, as he is in the film.I find it a bit of a shame that so much has been altered and cut away. Since the book is a self-biographical (ie. TRUE) story of what happened to Henri Charrière, I think it's a bit disrespectful to alter the story that much.All this being said, I still think that Papillon is a great and very moving film, I'd just like it to be the real story of what happened to Henri and not the mixed-together fact/fiction it was made to be.",Papillon

If you have read the book, you will probably not like the movie. I was able to sit through the entire movie, but was frustrated with most of it knowing what was in the book. Also, I found Dustin Hoffman to be a believable Louis Dega, but did not picture Steve McQueen as the Papillon I pictured when reading the book. If you have not read the book and really know nothing about Henri ""Papillon"" Charrière, you will probably find this movie enjoyable and entertaining. It will give you an idea of what life was like in a prison in French Guiana. Besides, we're talking Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. That alone makes it worth watching.

Another thing.....film is showing only painful parts of his life (exemption of indians). The worse part was when Pappilon escape with Dega and Maturete, in book it was Pappilon, Maturete and Clausiot. Then when they stopped on tropical forest everything happened on 5 minutes (no ants, no 7 days of camping, nothing....just 5 minutes of lies).

Hoffman is always an exceptional actor and in this movie he is no different. Unfortunately it neither won for, nor got nominated for an Oscar, and it deserved to win 3 (supporting actor, actor, picture). As much as I loved the Sting, this movie was better for that year.Some critics gave it a bad review, even a 1973 Roger Ebert article criticized this film. I guess you cant blame them too much, movies were better those days. Note that 1973 was sandwiched between 2 Godfather years.Maybe some people figured that McQueen was just redoing his Great Escape role.

The guy escapes again and again and ends up in the same place so why do we need to see the entire thing seeming like it is in actual real time taking forever? The end is OK but they could have gotten there sooner. I also thought that Dustin Hoffman's character was very annoying, he just didn't seem too believable.

Having re-watched it again over easter, I must say I was just bored and confused when we got to the second half of the movie. I still enjoyed the first half of the film up until they leave the leper but after that the pace gets strangely confusing. Episodic and disjointed as some say in their comments. I was lost as to why we spend 10 mins watching McQueen living with this Indian tribe running around with this half-naked woman. How much time was that supposed to be? Why do they all disappeared suddenly? I even thought maybe he's hallucinating or something.I kept trying to think maybe I should give the movie some slack as it is from the 70s. It must have been a very elaborate production at the time with such exotic set. The casting I must say is a total flop though. McQueen and Hoffman are great actors but why them? Shouldn't they be French (or at least have French accents)? Why are the rest of the prisoners Americans? And why are the ""bad guys"" (i.e. guards) English??

When I read the novel, I felt like I was in prison and like I was going through the same hardships as Papillon was. When I watched the movie, it didn't really leave any kind of impact on my emotions. It seems as though the screenwriters didn't read the novel, but had instead heard a few things about it, and then went on to write the screenplay.

But as it so often goes with movies, the producers had to cut out huge sections of the story. For example, after his first escape, Papillon lives as part of an Indian tribe for seven months, where he s accepted as one of their own and has two loving wives. The book, simply his notebooks containing the story lightly edited and published, places much emphasis on the people Papi meets on his adventure and the impact they have on his outlook on life. I honestly recommend this book very highly. The movie portrays a daring escape and brave adventure; the book portrays the true life of a man, and is so much better than any movie could ever capture.",Papillon
194,xkoskenkorvax,the characters,7,23 October 2014,"Sophia Loren was once in a movie named ""The Pride and the Passion,"" which involved hauling an enormous cannon halfway across Europe through deep mud. By the time they heaved the cannon into position, I had long since stopped caring, and even had a little difficulty remembering why they were doing it in the first place. The movie had expended enormous energy without cause. ""Papillon"" is a movie like that: an expensive, exhaustive, 150- mintue odyssey that doesn't so much conclude as cross the finish line and collapse. It has been outfitted with expensive stars and a glossy production, but it doesn't really make us care. When Steve McQueen finally escapes from Devil's Island we're happy more for ourselves than for him: Finally we can leave, too. The movie is based on a best seller by the late Frenchman Henri Charriere, who claimed it was a true story. Maybe. Not that it matters; fiction would have been fine if it had been entertaining. What happens in the movie, though, is that McQueen acts so dogged in his pursuit of freedom that we start looking around for supporting actors we can get interested in. The movie begins with Charriere (McQueen), nicknamed Papillon (or ""butterfly"") on board a prison ship. He meets Louis Dega (Dustin Hoffman, peering through Coke bottle glasses), the most famous counterfeiter in France. Dega's life is in danger for two reasons: (a) a lot of people were wiped out investing in his bogus 1928 national security bonds and (b) he has a lot of money concealed on (or should I say in?) his body. Once they have arrived in prison, Papillon makes a bargain: He'll be Dega's bodyguard if Dega will finance an escape try. This Dega agrees to do, although it is hard to understand, or even sense, the emotional bond between the two men. (To paraphrase Pauline Kael, McQueen underplays, and Hoffman tries to out-underplay him.) The movie slogs on like Sophia Loren, hauling that cannon through the mud. You know something has gone wrong when you want the hero to escape simply so that the movie can be over. At some point in the movie's pre-production, the theory apparently was held that we'd get interested in the contrast between Papillon, the man of action, and Dega, the gentle intellectual. The chemistry of McQueen and Hoffman was supposed to help. That was the theory, but in practice, we don't care because the characters never really escape as people. Hoffman is using his limp again from ""Midnight Cowboy,"" and McQueen squints into the sun a lot, and that's about it",Papillon

Steve McQueen plays a depressing role but does so in a way where the psychological torments are felt by the audience. This is a very underrated film and I can say wholeheartedly that does the book it's due justice. I am bummed that it is currently off the IMDb top 250 list hopefully it makes a return as it truly is a great film throughout. I have seen many Steve McQueen films and I want to pose the question of: is this his best? I believe it is truly in contention.",Papillon

198,osamutoglu,A must see...,10,25 February 2006,"This is the second greatest ""run after freedom"" movie i've ever seen. Two great actors Dustin Hoffman and Steve McQueen are able to present you disappointment, happiness, loyalty, patience, hope, insanity, friendship and depression perfectly. Every single scene in the picture has a lot of things to say to you. You might get emotionally confused when watching this movie, you might even sense a little bit of friendship or love between the prison guardians and the prisoners and at the same time you might be able to sense the unreasonable hate. When you are not free, then you have nothing else to lose thus you have to run after your freedom, however do not believe in freedom until you get what you used to have before losing it.",Papillon
