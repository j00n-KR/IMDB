0,TheLittleSongbird,A deadly ride,7,5 December 2017,"While it was not a great or perfect film (particularly in the dialogue, ending and some of the acting), the first 'Final Destination' was entertaining and effective (especially with its terrific opening plane sequence and the creative deaths) with a fascinating idea done well.The bigger and bolder 'Final Destination 2' had its flaws but was just as good and perhaps the best of the four sequels. 'Final Destination 3' is just as big and bold, as well as gorier, and is also as good. Second sequels or third instalments of a franchise don't always fare well, especially in horror and comedy, 'Final Destination 3' is one of the better examples in a genre where sequels have a patchy history. The novelty has not yet worn off and in a way is more refined.Sure, the story is more of the same and formulaic. Meanwhile, there is too much dull downtime between deaths where dialogue and exposition can be clumsy at times.The special effects are not always brilliant and the characters are as shallow as ever.However, 'Final Destination 3' is as atmospheric and stylish as its previous two films. The music has a haunting eeriness and James Wong does a more than competent job in the director's chair, showing a genuine understanding of the concept and the horror genre, breathing atmosphere, fun and freshness into a tried and tested formula and not losing what made his direction work in the first film.Like the second, although there is a little too much of an over-reliance on gore, not all of it necessary, the death scenes are bolder, more elaborate and more creative (faring even better in this regard actually). The tanning bed and nail gun deaths were particularly good and two of the best and most imaginative of the series. The script has some wonderful humour that is black and ironic and has just as much tension and a sense of dread. The amusement park/roller-coaster scene is not as good as the opening scenes in the previous films, especially visually, but it's still very scary. The photo record is surprising and there is an intricacy in places.'Final Destination 3' has the best ending perhaps of the series, to me it's the least contrived and more logical than the one in particularly the second film. In the acting stakes, it fares favourably too. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is very good.Overall, a good deadly ride that's worth getting on board for, as long as one knows what to expect. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Final Destination 3
1,Leofwine_draca,"The worst set-piece accident yet, but it's better than the second film",6,14 July 2016,"Back in the '80s, this would have been a slasher film, with a physical killer murdering the teenagers in gruesome ways, one by one. Two decades later, the new millennium favours 'curse' type slasher movies, probably because of the Japanese influence This is the third entry in a film series in which the unseen presence of death claims teenagers one by one in increasingly inventive and gory ways.I saw the first FINAL DESTINATION at the cinema and loved it – a fun, gory horror film, unlike the kind they were making at the turn of the century. I ended up watching the second one on television and I didn't like it as much, finding it a sometimes insipid retread of the first film's antics. This one does away with any big storyline and just focuses on the unpleasant deaths, throwing in the angle of a camera that predicts the deaths (another familiar plot device; THE OMEN used it back in the '70s).In a way, this makes for a speedier, pared-down ride as there's no predictable set up or boring bits of exposition. We're just straight in the action (with the most mundane accident, at a carnival, yet) and then the gruesome deaths begin. The ante has been upped here and the weird kills are all very nasty – whether it's the naked girls frying on their sun beds or the car accident that sees part of a guy's head fly off. Blood sprays through the air freely and despite some dodgy CGI here and there, horror fans will have a ball with the level of gore on display. The bit with the nail gun is probably the most vicious of the entire franchise.I also liked the ending, which threatens to peter out but becomes another big set piece that ties up loose ends nicely. Seeing as how most of the cast are unlikeable or irritating, you won't mind much when they die. Mary Elizabeth Winstead displays little of the presence she showed in DIE HARD 4.0 and is a bland leading lady, while her friends and other teenagers are plain annoying – especially the token black guy, who they make the dumbest in the movie. Thankfully there's another Tony Todd cameo to enjoy, although this time it's his voice alone we here, as he plays the voice of the devil at the fairground. Unsurprisingly a fourth entry has been announced, with the added gimmick of 3D to get audiences to go and see it.",Final Destination 3
2,SnoopyStyle,Getting tedious,4,21 October 2013,"It's 6 years since the plane crash in the first movie. A senior high school graduating class is having a party at the amusement park. Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) foresees a roller coaster accident and freaks out. She and some other students get kicked off. The roller coaster crashed killing her boyfriend.Am I the only one who finds the FD kills too tedious? Something weird happens, then something else happens, then there's a close call, then somebody gets killed in a freaky way. It was fun for the first movie, but it was never scary. The formula has gotten too formulaic.The only one I like is when they escape from the runaway truck. It's set up clearly from a long way away. The excitement builds. There's suspense. It's a more classic horror move. I didn't even care about the guy getting his head motor-chopped. That's just pointless gore. The escape was the exciting part and much more compelling.The addition of the picture predictions didn't help anything. It could be more compelling if it actually explained things. For sure, it doesn't add anything exciting.",Final Destination 3
3,claudio_carvalho,Death Cannot Be Cheated,7,28 January 2007,"In McKinley, Pennsylvania, a group of teenagers are celebrating their sooner graduation in high-school in an amusement park. After taking pictures of her mates, Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a premonition of a horrible accident with the roller coaster and she leaves her spot followed by some friends. When the accident happens, her friend Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman) tells her about the fatal flight 180 and the fate of the survivors. Wendy analyzes the pictures in her camera and sees that each one of them foresees the death of each survivor. Together with Kevin, Wendy tries to advise her mates, but death cannot be cheated.When I see ""Final Destination"" series, I previously know what all is about, and I expect to see great accidents and deaths. Therefore, ""Final Destination 3"" does not disappoint, showing original deaths. The sequence of the initial accident is impressive, and the young group of actors and actresses has good performances. In the end, I liked this entertaining movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Premonição 3"" (""Premonition 3"")",Final Destination 3
4,kosmasp,You know the drill,7,24 April 2007,"No pun intended with that summary ... or maybe I there was an intention behind that ... ;o) Seriously though, I don't think that you will watch this movie without having seen the other two parts (not that it is necessary, whether story-wise nor character-wise, because everything is explained here too, at the beginning of the movie of course).And when it starts, there is no stopping. There is no plot here and the characters are even thinner than a paper. But is that the reason why you're going to watch this movie? If the answer is yes, than stay away from that, but if you're here to have fun, with this horror flick, than stay and enjoy! It's a helluva ride! ;o)",Final Destination 3
5,gavin6942,A Roller-coaster Ride of Teen Horror Proportions,7,14 January 2007,"As several classmates die on a roller-coaster, Death starts coming after those who got off the ride at the last minute. Like the first and second films, the kids are killed off one by one and they must find a way to break the pattern before they are all wiped from the pages of history.This film stars young actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who is great in every possible way and very ""hot"" in her own way. I enjoyed her role in this film. While, as my brother correctly pointed out, there are no real big name actors in this picture, Winstead is looking like she'll be big in the world of horror if her agent doesn't change her auditions. She has appeared in ""Black Christmas"", ""The Ring Two"" and will soon appear in ""Grindhouse"". (Incidentally, at least one other actress from this picture appears in ""Black Christmas"", so they must re-use a lot of unknown young actresses around these teen horror movies.) I suppose you could consider the voice of Tony Todd (""Candyman"") as a celebrity, but it's a stretch (though I'm both impressed and disappointed in myself that I recognized his voice right away).At the beginning, I was really not expecting much. The film has only the thinnest connection to the first two films. Also, the big roller-coaster scene in the beginning has been talked up and is even featured on the cover of the movie. I hate to be a party pooper, but I thought this was one of the worst scenes in the movie -- not scary, poor special effects. But after I kept watching, things went from doubt to hope. And I got a decent movie.There are some great gore scenes in this movie. I will say there is a cool nail gun scene and another part involving a truck's engine fan. Disgusting, and completely worth watching this film for.The best part of the movie -- nothing else comes close -- is a tanning bed scene. The writer is a genius: he not only throws in one great urban legend about tanning beds (which I won't reveal here), but he works in the old legend of the Ohio Players song ""Love Roller-coaster"" having a scream recorded in it, involving a tanning bed. Further, the song ""Love Roller-coaster"" clearly ties back to the main story because it has the word ""roller-coaster"" (duh). These little touches are the brilliance of the film.Likewise, the use of character names to reflect on old horror directors was great. Everyone knows about Romero, but not everyone knows who Freund is or that Halperin is a nod to Victor Halperin, the director of ""White Zombie"" (among others). I don't think I would have caught on to this without it being pointed out to me by a website, but so much more of this film was opened up to me when I became aware of these details.Visually, the film is alright. As I said, the roller-coaster scene fails and some of the gore is very good. But the director also has some interesting fades and reveal shots. After the tanning bed scene, two tanning beds fade out and two coffins fade in over the top. It's a simple effect, but I thought it looked really classy and was well-conceived.A quick note: I appreciated them using the 9/11 attacks in this film as a plot device. I guess some critics are still saying ""too soon"", but after five years I'm glad we can start to move on and incorporate this into our lives, rather than make it a sacred event.My friend Jason considers part two the best in the series, and I think either two or three are the best. Consensus? If you watched the first one, you should catch the sequels. While the general idea is rehashed over and over again, it actually works in a way that other sequels are unable to do (because this film doesn't require maniacs to keep coming back from the dead). Well worth your time.",Final Destination 3
6,jboothmillard,Final Destination 3,5,20 February 2006,"""This ride will be the death of you."" This was the first film in the franchise I saw at the cinema, and it became was my favourite of all the instalments. When I was younger, I found this scary movie, and the other sequels, thrilling and fun, I'm glad I watched again to get a better perspective, directed by James Wong (The X-Files, Final Destination, The One, Black Christmas). Basically, high school student Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) visits an amusement park in Pennsylvania. She is there with her boyfriend Jason Wise (Jesse Moss), her best friend Carrie Dreyer (Gina Holden), Carrie's boyfriend Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman) and their fellow classmates to celebrate their graduation. During the night, Wendy is taking photos for the high school yearbook. The Devil's Flight roller coaster is the most popular ride at the park. As they board the ride, Wendy has a premonition that during the ride the hydraulics securing the seat belts and coaster cars will fail, causing a crash and killing everyone on board. She and nine other people are either forced off or decide to leave the ride, after Wendy's panicking causes a fight. Among those that get off the ride are ditsy best Ashley Freund (Chelan Simmons) and Ashlyn Halperin (Crystal Lowe), previously graduated Frankie Cheeks (Sam Easton), athlete Lewis Romero (Texas Battle), and goth couple Ian McKinley (Kris Lemche) and Erin Ulmer (Alexz Johnson). But Jason and Carrie remain on the ride and are among the remain passengers killed when the roller coaster derails. Several weeks later, Kevin tells Wendy about the explosion of Flight 180 and the subsequent deaths of the survivors, believing they may be in a similar situation. At a tanning salon, Ashley and Ashlyn die after being trapped in malfunctioning tanning beds and burning them alive. Wendy looks back through her photographs from the night at the theme park and notices they each have strange omens hidden in them. Wendy and Kevin believe these photos are clues as to how the survivors will meet their fates, and they are convinced that Death (the Grim Reaper) is stalking them. They decide to warn the remaining survivors. On the way, they pull into a drive-thru restaurant when a when a runaway semi-trailer forces them to jump out the car, the crash causes the truck motor to fly out behind the person in the car in front, and Wendy and Kevin are shocked to find it is Frankie dead with his skull sliced up. he next day, Wendy and Kevin fail to save Lewis whose head is crushed by two weights from a bow flex machine at the school gym. They find Ian and Erin working at a hardware store where a chain reaction causes a forklift to run into a wall of tools. Wendy manages to save Ian from death, but in doing so, Erin falls onto a nail gun that shoots repeatedly through her head. Wendy is trying to identify the other two unknown survivors from her vision, when she realises one of them was her sister Julie (Amanda Crew) and a friend who escaped the crash. She and Kevin rush to the local tricentennial fair to save them. Julie cheats death when Kevin saves her from being impaled on a harrow. But it is too late for the other survivor, Julie's friend Perry Malinowski (Maggie Ma), who is impaled by an airborne flagpole moments later. Wendy saves Kevin from an exploding propane canister. Then, a grief-stricken Ian appears, he blames Wendy for Erin's death and threatens them. An unstable cart of firework cannons is blasted, causing a cherry picker behind Ian to fall and crush him in half. Five months later, Wendy experiences more omens, seeing advertisements for locations where the previous deaths occurred, while riding on a subway train with her roommate Laura (Agam Darshi) and her friend Sean (Dylan Basile). Feeling anxious, Wendy wants to get off, when she suddenly reunites with Julie and Kevin who both also boarded the train. Wendy has another premonition of the subway train crashing and killing everyone on board. Wendy and the others panic when they realise this terror is happening again and attempt to stop the train, their fate is unknown, although you hear crashing. Also starring Candyman's Tony Todd (seen in the previous two films) as the voice of the Devil and the train conductor. Winstead gives a terrific star-making performance, the other cast members are fine, the concept of the villain being Death itself stalking the victims and the clues in the photos is clever, and many can relate to the fear of riding a roller coaster. The pace and editing are good, it is eerie and creepy at the right moments, and the deaths are much more inventive, gory, and over-the, best involving sunbeds and a nail gun. There are only a couple of chatty or slow moments, overall, it is an entertaining and worthwhile horror thriller. Worth watching!",Final Destination 3
7,ma-cortes,Chilling and thrilling sequel with emphasis on increasing the luridness of the set pieces death scenes,6,10 March 2012,"Entertaining follow-up and again with horrifying killings . Eerie chiller with portentous special effects and results to be a nasty piece of work . This sequel of successful original by James Wong deals with a beautiful student of a High School senior named Wendy Christensen ( Maria Elizabeth Winstead ) who along with her friends go to a theme park and decide to go on a large roller coaster . There Wendy has a vision and aware which by avoiding it, she and others ( Ryan Merryman , Texas Battle, Chelan Simmons , Amanda Crew ..) around her have saved but soon begin dying in bizarre accidents . The girl's premonition of a deadly roller-coaster ride saves her life and a lucky few, but not from death itself which seeks out those who escaped their fate . Amusement and entertainment resides from attempting to guess which of the ludicrously over-determined potential hazards will deliver the creepy killings .In this third installment of the ¨Final Destination¨ series appears none character repeating from former entries , it displays suspense, tension, thrills, and creepy deaths . The chief excitement lies in seeing what new and astonishing victim can be dreamt by the believable FX technicians . Movie exist for only aim of murdering its protagonists and all around in terrifying realistic detail . Death seem to dispatch new weird killing every few minutes of movie, throughout crashing, beheading , blowing up , crushing, burning , etc . Here death is a mere computer generator FX , the ultimate gross-out show . It's frightening and entertaining though predictable but we have seen the original with similar and interesting premise . Although its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting of protagonists and all around . Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Robert McLachlan . Thrilling musical score fitting to action and suspense by Shirley Walker . The motion picture is written by Glen Morgan and professionally directed by James Wong , though without originally because of going on the similar argument to former outings , being a fresh fodder . Wong has a long career as writer , producer : X-files and finally filmmaker , directing Box office success such as ¨The one¨, ¨Final destination¨ and the flop ¨Dragon ball¨. Followed by more sequels.",Final Destination 3
8,BA_Harrison,Great funFD3 delivers the goods!!,8,7 August 2006,"With the third in the Final Destination series, it's definitely a case of 'if it ain't broke, then don't fix it' . Director James Wong produces a carbon copy of the previous movies, but still manages to deliver a roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills.It is fitting then, that the opening disaster sequence actually takes place on a humongous roller coaster. With the cars packed with extremely photogenic teens and ready to go, pretty control freak Wendy has a waking dream in which she sees the faulty ride cause the death of everyone on board. Freaking out, she demands to be let off the ride; this causes a fracas which results in several others being kicked off. Lucky for them, 'cos Wendy's dream comes true. 'Splat!' go the teens left on board! From then on we are in familiar territory, as death systematically catches up with those that survived the tragedy.The real fun to be had with this series of films is not in guessing who is going to die, or even when they are going to die...no, the fun is in guessing how they are going to die. And boy, they sure do go in spectacularly inventive and grisly fashion. Wong toys with the audience, hinting at all manner of ways in which the next victim might cop it, and just when you think you've figured out what will happen, he catches the viewer off-guard and delivers a sucker punch of a death scene. The highly convoluted and intricately staged deaths are the star of this film, and they do not disappoint. Deliciously over the top and extremely gory, my only gripe is with the over reliance on CGI blood (I'm strictly old school when it comes to my blood 'n' guts).FD3 delivers everything a fright fan would want in a modern teen horror (even throwing in a couple of topless honeys for the boys) and I for one am looking forward to another installment in the near future.",Final Destination 3
9,BandSAboutMovies,Coasters,4,3 September 2020,"I realize that I watch a lot of movies. However, this point was hammered home when I realized that I saw three movies where people were killed by a tanning bed in one week. For anyone else, they'd see this as a moment to step back. Not me. I glared into the gaping maw of early 2000's teen-friendly horror sequels and looked back before diving in, sternly speaking right to the camera, stating ""I'll see you in Hell.""Directed by the returning James Wong (series creator Jeffrey Reddick did not come back), this film starts with a rollercoaster accident scene that will, much like flying in the first movie and driving in the second, make you never want to go to a theme park again.Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as Wendy Christensen, whose premonition of the disaster keeps her friends from getting on the coaster, which leads to...look, if you've seen any of these movies, you understand how they work. You show up for the insane death sequences and wait for Tony Todd to show up and remind you exactly how much you love him. This time, all you get is his voice as the Devil before a ride and as the announcer on the subway.Winstead teamed up again with Ryan Merriman, who she also appeared in The Ring Two as the teens that try - as always, in vain - to rescue the people that Death is killing. The funny thing is, this movie makes it obvious that you shouldn't fight fate, because then you end up baked to a crisp while just trying to get a good summer glow on.My DVD of this movie also features a Choose Their Fate option, which gives you some control over the movie, mainly changing some of the death scenes. My favorite part is that if you decide to keep the characters from even boarding the roller coaster, the movie goes directly to the credits. Like I always say, when people ask, ""Why do people do such dumb things in horror movies?"" I say, ""Well, we wouldn't have this movie otherwise.""",Final Destination 3
10,Coventry,"Definitely not the ""FINAL"" Destination.",5,27 January 2007,"Seriously, they could make a hundred more of these movies, just as long as the overpaid writers can simply come up with enough different settings! Much more like any of the entries in the ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween""-franchises, ""Final Destination"" parts 1,2 & 3 are identical to each other! There's always a bunch of people in a mildly precarious situation together. One individual suddenly has a vision of a terrible upcoming accident involving all of them and makes a little bit of an hysterical scene which causes the whole group to 'escape' their deaths, as naturally the vision was truthful. Initially they all feel very relieved, but since Mr. Death is someone who really can't stand losing, they all meet their horrible fates shortly after and in the order the were supposed to die in the original accident. James Wong, who also directed the original film, doesn't even bother to add something to the concept and clearly spent most of his time admiring all the gorgeous young actresses that walked over the sets with few clothes on. And I can't even blame him for that! Anyway, you can complain all you want about the lack of originality and tension, the ""Final Destination"" films nevertheless remain entertaining, as they always guarantee loads of spectacle and bloody nasty killings! The lambs to the slaughter in part three  a bunch of graduating high-school students  walked away from a roller-coaster accident, so don't expect any of their eventual deaths to be a little merciful. People lose their heads in imaginative ways, get burned alive, crushed by billboards or (my personal favorite) are executed by industrial factory tools operating on themselves. James Wong moves the action from one gory set piece to another very fast, leaving you almost no time to get irritated by the awful acting performances or laughable dialogs. The building up towards the highly implausible accidents is always incredibly far-fetched and you need to be an undemanding horror fan, exclusively looking for some thrills, in order to enjoy them. Sequels to a dessicated horror idea can only distinguish themselves with a larger amount of bloodshed and/or sleaze, and that's clearly the intention the producers had. Oh well, at least the sequels aren't getting worse.There's been three movies in the ""Final Destination"" series thus far, so why change the winning team? Here are some suggestions for ""Final Destination"" parts 4, 5 and 6! The 100-headed orchestra of New York is ready to give their fancy 4th of July recital, but a dozen of musicians run off the balcony just a couple of seconds before it crashes down. Part five is slightly more ambitious and large-scaled in my view. Historical researchers discover that a large number of people who survived the Titanic disaster, for example the ones that were picked out of the water, died in mysterious accidents shortly after the events. How's that? Final Destination part five would largely take place in the 1910's! And then, finally, part 6 could be half-horror and half-spoof, with a clique of untalented wannabe actors encountering the Grim Reaper shortly after surviving an explosion on the set of a low-keyed horror sequel. Let me know what you think of these ideas, all you good people over at New Line Cinema!",Final Destination 3
11,michaelRokeefe,Cheating death? Good luck.,6,26 July 2006,"Third and fright filled installment of the FINAL DESTINATION series. Simalar to the others...just different situations causing the splatter of blood and other human matter. On a Graduation party at an amusement park, a Senior named Wendy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead)has a premonition of a fatal roller coaster accident that will have the survivors not knowingly pay for cheating death.The roller coaster ride is awesome and nerve wrecking; but my favorite scene takes place with two winsome teens stripping for the tanning booth. Of course that setting turns into gruesome death. One by one these friends and classmates meet their demise.The cast features: Alexz Johnson, Jesse Moss, Ryan Merriman, Texas Battle, Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe. Nudity, language violence and graphic gore are reasons enough for a strong R rating. I was impressed with a ghoulish version of ""Love Train"" in the final credits sung by Tommy Lee.",Final Destination 3

13,hitchcockthelegend,Roller Toaster.,7,28 July 2015,"Final Destination the series moves into its third instalment without really changing the formula that was working for it. Here the opening disaster involves a Roller Coaster crash that is brought via a premonition to Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). As in the previous two films, the visionary and some friends get spooked and get off the coaster to find it actually does crash and a bunch of horrific deaths befall all those on board. Sure enough the survivors start being killed off in equally gruesome ways, it becomes apparent that the old grim reaper is out to claim the deaths that were denied him.The opening section of FD3 is superb, the credits roll to a back drop of various carnival/fairground attractions that offer up foreboding terror, all backed by an eerie rumbling musical score. Then the crash itself is excellently stage, so much so that anyone frightened of Roller Coasters can point to this as a reason why! Then we revert to type, the youthful cast get bumped off in more ingenious ways, with more gore and lashings of dark humour pumped up this time (the use of Love Roller Coaster by The Ohio Players is genius). The narrative drive this time involves photographs, which is a nice touch and overcomes the triteness of some dialogue exchanges.It's a safe entry in the series, and it boasts in Winstead the best young lead actress of the whole franchise. As with all horror films - franchises, some will love it and some will hate it, but ultimately it really does exactly what the previous two films did. So if a fan of those then this does a good job as well. The 2 disc DVD comes with a delightful choose their fate option, which with a bit of playing around gives you a slightly different version of the film. While it is recommended you turn up your home cinema systems for the Roller Coaster segments. 7/10",Final Destination 3
14,Theo Robertson,A Step Down From The Second Film,6,15 August 2010,"I recently had a PM conversation on the topic of horror films with someone who doesn't like horror films . They mentioned my review of FINAL DESTINATION 2 and thought the film might have been better if the film had set out to horrify or repulse the audience rather than amuse or entertain them . I felt this was unfair since the FD movies work in a similar manner to the classic episodes of CASUALTY where the audience are trying to second guess the script as to what happens next . We see a lingering shot of a chip pan thinking it'll suddenly burst in to flame only to have our expectations quashed as a plane crashes out of the sky fatally injuring the occupant of the house . CASUALTY started losing a lot of acclaim when it started to metamorphoses in to yet another soap opera . Having said that after you've seen FINAL DESTINATION 3 you start to realise how much the franchise did become a wasted opportunity FD 3 is directed by James Wong who also co-wrote and co-produced the film along with Glen Morgan . Both men worked alongside Chris Carter in making THE X FILES a massive television success on both sides of the Atlantic . They have a heritage in making the fantastical credible , they're not idiots but with hindsight the FINAL DESTINATION series isn't as good as it could have been . To be fair the first movie does inject a slightly different take on the horror genre with teenagers not being killed by a monster but being killed by destiny itself . The second movie was a definite improvement in that the protagonists were drawn from a larger demographic of society including a mother and child . With the third film we're back to teenagers again . FD 2 had no input from Wong and Morgan and is considered the best in the series . Can you see who may be to blame that the series didn't reach its full potential ?The emphasis on teen characters panders to the demographics of a teen audience . Perhaps in the first film we had adult characters instead of adolescent ones the series may have taken off as an intelligent horror series with wider appeal and acclaim ? As it stands FD 3 is populated by very unsympathetic high school students . The muscle bound jock , two bitchy self centered bimbos who need to top up on their tan before attending a memorial service etc . One can't help thinking this would have been a much more memorable horror series if Wong and Morgan envisaged the films as being geared towards intelligent adults who want horror films that don't talk down to them . As it stands FINAL DESTINATION 3 isn't bad but isn't great either and shows how limited and formulaic a franchise can become",Final Destination 3
15,Scarecrow-88,Final Destination 3,7,1 December 2007,"Wendy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a control freak, is the chosen one who foresees tragic deaths at the hands of a roller-coaster hydraulics disaster causing the ride to run off it's rails. Certain characters are prevented this disaster, but, unfortunately, Wendy's boyfriend and best friend are not amongst the survivors. Her best friend's boyfriend, Kevin(Ryan Merriman)will assist her in trying to cheat death's force once again as it's angry and hungry for those souls lost in it's grip the first time around.Among the gory death sequences include a horrifying tanning incident(I'll never set foot in a tanning bed after seeing this), how a motor fan(exploding from the hood of Kevin's truck as they ""dodge death"")can inflict damage to a person's skull, how an exercise machine can be bad for your health(..specifically your head), how not to use a staple gun(one word for this sequence..OUCH!), and how a sign can smash one poor soul slicing him in half(quite a nasty bit of business). But, these death sequences don't even come close to the harrowing subway sequence that closes the film. Wendy's premonition of the roller-coaster disaster is quite a humdinger as well. Before each death, the film exposes to us death's design in full from start to finish..how every little detail is met to ensure those targeted die quite terribly. When death's design takes root, Wendy feels the force like a wind..in a graveyard scene, trees actually tilt to one side! Also, Wendy's camera, that took photos for the yearbook containing the characters who made it off the roller-coaster, gives away clues to how they each will die the second time.Like in the Saw series, I can just picture script writers at their laptops and around tables with their thinking caps on coming up with elaborate ways on how to murder these characters in the film. Surely, though, if you are entering the theater by the third film you ought to know what you're in for. It's all about how death will retrieve the souls that escaped it the first time, but far more unpleasantly. I believe this supernatural(literally)slasher should please fans of the series. It delivers, I believe, exactly what fans expect. More discriminating viewers will probably quite often exclaim, ""Yeah right"", rolling their eyes, bemoaning at such a picture as this one. I'm a fan of the series so it worked well enough for me.",Final Destination 3
16,Hey_Sweden,"More of the same, but still fun.",7,21 May 2019,"You all know the drill by now: our lead character, in this case Wendy (the lovely Mary Elizabeth Winstead), has a horrific premonition of death before she is about to take a roller coaster ride. She and others get off the ride, and the lead characters' vision actually comes to pass. Then Death, who always gets incredibly ticked off when cheated, returns to stalk the survivors, eliminating them in a variety of elaborate ways.And so it goes, with the people destined to be the last ones standing trying in vain to warn others of what is likely going to happen. Of course, nobody ever listens. Still, the movie is entertaining as it once again plays that ""Final Destination"" formula for everything that it's worth. The extreme violence and mayhem is once again extremely amusing in its often over the top, and sometimes cartoonish, nature. There really isn't much of a story, but then there doesn't need to be when all is said and done. Anybody who digs sequential slaughter of unlucky victims is sure to be entertained. 'X-Files' veterans James Wong (who also directs) and Glen Morgan give the movie great pace; at the very least, ""Final Destination 3"" wastes little time getting to the good stuff.The acting in these things is never going to win any awards, but kudos to Winstead and her male co-lead Ryan Merriman for creating two reasonably likeable and engaging leads. Sam Easton is truly annoying as shameless sleaze ball Frankie. Chelan Simmons (whose credits date back to playing the first on-screen victim in 'Stephen King's It' (1990)) and Yan-Kay Crystal Lowe play two gals who figure in the movies' most memorable set piece, set inside a tanning salon. Buffs can hardly fail to notice that, once again, characters are named after vintage genre figures: (Karl) Freund, (Victor) Halperin, (Carl Theodor) Dreyer, (Robert) Wise, etc.Overall, pretty entertaining in a truly visceral way, and one of the better sequels in this franchise.Seven out of 10.",Final Destination 3
17,Doylenf,Death has a will of its own in this teen horror flick...,6,12 October 2008,"Once you accept the basic premise--that death can come calling on anyone in its own mysterious way and with a mind of its own--you can sit back and enjoy the stark fear of watching the tragic deaths occur in FINAL DESTINATION 3. It's a horror flick in the same tradition as the ""Scream"" entries in this genre.A girl with the ability to forecast disasters before they happen (MARY ELIZABETH WINSTEAD) gets the chance to develop this skill a number of times while various accidental deaths occur in swift fashion. First of all comes the roller coaster ride, extremely well photographed for maximum effect as cables snap, wheels go off track, the ride is hung upside down, and screaming riders try to ward off certain death as they cling in mid-air to whatever they can. It's a very effective way of starting off this thriller in clever fashion.Afterwards, the other weird happenings are telegraphed in advance and not quite as well staged, except for the tanning bed sequence which has a creepiness all its own as two ""hotties"" decide to work on their tans. There's a sharp sense of humor involved too, which makes the deaths even more diabolical.Not much plot to worry about, in fact all of the events are pretty well laid out as if on a timetable and there's nothing deep in the explanations for whatever happens. The detective work by the girl and her boyfriend is pretty simplistic involving a series of photos that are supposed to give them clues as to who's next as unfortunate victim.Not bad, as these sort of things go, in fact some of it is pretty gripping. But the final scene aboard a train before it derails is really almost overkill, coming as it does after so many other deaths have already been staged, making it seem anticlimactic.Summing up: Not bad if teen horror flicks are your thing.",Final Destination 3
18,preppy-3,Here we go again!,6,26 February 2006,"A young high school girl (Mary Elizabeth Winsted) freaks out before going on a roller coaster ride--she ""sees"" the roller coaster car malfunctioning and everybody on board dying. She refuses to get on and some other people leave too. Then--the car does malfunction and people die...but death goes after the people who left early. Basically the same plot as the last two films.I had no intention of seeing this--the first one was sorta OK but the second was dreadful. But this one has been getting good reviews from critics--who usually hate horror films. So I gave it a try. It is better than the second...but still not that good.The plot is the same as before, but it does have her taking digital pictures of the kids before they got on and using them to find ""clues"" on how they're gonna get it. The opening roller coaster sequence is GREAT and gory as are the deaths and the ending but the plot wavers. It has her and a friend rushing to tell everybody that they're gonna die--they don't believe her--and die a bloody death. That's basically the whole movie! It gets dull after the third time.Still this has a fairly good script, great stereo sound, excellent special effects and two pretty good performances by Winstead and Ryan Merriman. Also there is some STRONG black humor throughout the film. So it's OK but still not that good. I give it a 6.",Final Destination 3
19,LeonLouisRicci,Pleasurable Enough to Make You Feel Guilty,6,31 March 2015,"The Roller Coaster Opening is a Disappointment considering, for one, it's a Roller Coaster, and two, the opening Highway Scene in the Second Movie was so Good. There is one Death Scene that is so Reminiscent of a similar Scene in the Second Movie that it comes off as Horribly Ho-Hum. Finally, the Ending is very very Unworthy of the Franchise cleverness and leaves the Movie with a Credit Roll from an Ending that was Decidedly Dull.Other than those Three Letdowns this is another Guilty Pleasure for Blood-Lusters and is a Numbered Franchise Cash-In that is by the Numbers.

20,poolandrews,Another good Final Destination sequel.,7,26 December 2009,"Final Destination 3 is set in the small town of McKinley & starts at an amusement park where a group of high school seniors are on a night out, a group of friends decide to take a ride on the roller-coaster but Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a terrifying vision of the roller-coaster crashing & killing everyone on-board including her & her friends. Because of this Wendy shouts & screams & manages to get herself & several of her friends thrown off the ride & as in her vision it crashes killing everyone including Wendy's boyfriend Jason (Jesse Moss), Wendy & those who were saved by her vision are devastated by what happened. One survivor Kevin (Ryan Merriman) discovers on the Internet premonitions about fatal accidents have happened before & those who were saved by them start to die in bizarre accidents. As the same things begins to happen to the roller-coaster survivors can Wendy & Kevin find a way to save themselves...This American, German & Canadian production was co-written, co-produced & directed by James Wong & is the second of currently three sequels to the original Final Destination (2000) which is generally considered to be a fine teen horror film which I concur with & Final Destination 3 is another good horror film that doesn't stray away from the basic concept that much but does deliver the goods in most departments. The basic plot of all the first three Final Destination films (I haven't seen the most recent one... yet) are more or less the same with only cosmetic differences like here the initial premonition & accident takes place on a roller-coaster rather than on an aeroplane & then the survivors who cheated fate get killed off by death in a variety of novelty set-piece death scenes & that's all there is to the Final Destination films really so it's safe to say that if you enjoyed the first two films in the series than there's every chance you will enjoy this. The character's are no worse or better than before although Wendy is a rather unsympathetic heroine, the dialogue is alright & at 90 odd minutes it moves along at a good pace & certainly entertains with some memorably gruesome death's. The one aspect that Final destination 3 does introduce into the series are the photo's that hint at the various character's death's & trying to work out the danger & defeat it but it doesn't amount to much in the end. There's also an odd running gag referring to assassinated US Presidents which I picked up on that went over my head a bit & can't really see the relevance.Originally this was going to be shot in 3-D & was going to be called Final Destination 3-D but those plans were scrapped in the end although the next Final Destination film did go down the 3-D route. There's the usual crowd pleasing gore scenes with some memorable ones on show here including being burned alive in sunbeds, people are squashed to bloody pulps, someone gets a face full of nails fired from a nail-gun, someones head is squashed, a girl is impaled on a flag pole & slides down it & some sort of fan on an engine slices the back of someones head clean off. It's all filmed within a series unlikely but amusing coincidence's that make the various accidents happen & the expectation is quite cool as you just wait for the big pay-off as another character is killed. There's also some nice nudity as a couple of hot girls take their tops off, hey I'm easily pleased alright? Interestingly you can change certain scenes on the interactive DVD where different versions were obviously filmed, while nothing major changes expect Frankie no longer dies but it show's a lot of alternate footage was shot & didn't make it.With a supposed budget of about $34,000,000 this wasn't a mega-budget film by any means & it uses it's budget wisely enough with good special effects & production values. Filmed in British Columbia in Canada with the roller-coaster scenes shot at the Playland Amusement Park there. The acting is solid enough from a decent teen cast but no-one really stands out as being amazing.Final Destination 3 is a more than adequate follow up to Final Destination & Final Destination 2 (2003) which were both great films, a third sequel The Final Destination (2009) was released recently in 3-D although I haven't seen it yet. Well worth a watch if your after some popcorn entertainment.",Final Destination 3
21,lastliberal,Death is f*cking complicated.,6,18 February 2008,"I still have not see the first one, but this was not as good as the second. They completely left out the premonition background and focused on how the last were to die.Of course, as someone who like roller coasters, I may have to give them up now. That was a disappointment.Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Live Free or Die Hard, Death proof) was a welcome addition and made the film move foe me.Seeing Ashley (Chelan Simmons) and Ashlyn (Crystal Lowe) get the toasted titties was just too cool!

22,Boba_Fett1138,Entertaining but I hope it will be the last of the series.,6,27 October 2006,"Guess I was wrong. I thought that the Final Destination series could grow out to be a long series of movies, without ever loosing any of its power, as long as each movie would have new characters and settings in it. ""Final Destination 3"" however has lost lots of its power, when compared to the first two movies. This movie is definitely the least good of the series, not in the least because of its lacking originality and its level of predictability.When you have seen the first two movies, this movie has very little new to offer you. Basically the storyline is the same and when you've seen the first two movies, nothing that happens in this movie should come as a real surprise. The false scares before the real big main scare, the upcoming deaths. When you've seen the first two movies, you're already prepared for all those things, so nothing comes as a surprise any more. It makes ""Final Destination 3"" not as powerful as the first two establishments of the series.""Final Destination"" had a plane crash. ""Final Destination 2"" had a huge pileup and ""Final Destination 3"" has a roller-coaster accident. Out of all the three this is definitely the least spectacular one. It's not as creatively constructed and quite frankly is also not spectacular enough. And above that, it also is quite fake looking, which doesn't help to make it any more believable.The build up to the accident of the movie seems to take forever. It takes its time with its build up but without ever creating much interesting depth for the character. So basically the build up is an huge empty one, until finally the action occurs. After that the movie takes pace but yet also finds a way to put in some needless emotions that make things all the more less credible. The movie just has a bit too many unlikely elements in it, which does makes this movie an at times ridicules one.But the movie also does some things well. The characters are all good. They're over-the-top and all extreme stereotypes but that works very well to the entertainment value of the movie. It makes the movie fun and the characters all likable, each in their own way.The movie is still entertaining to watch, also thinks to its highly imaginative and creative deaths, although they unfortunately are not as good as in the previous two movies. But perhaps also the fact that this movie is not original and therefor also not surprising anymore, is the reason why the deaths in the movie don't work out as good, surprising and creative as in the previous two movies. Who knows.All in all, the movie is still perfectly entertaining enough to watch but still I hope that this was the last establishment in the Final Destination series. Most of its power and surprises are already gone in this movie. More movies would definitely make things worse and will not be halve as good as the first movies, no matter how creative they will be.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Final Destination 3

24,view_and_review,Death is very vindictive,7,1 June 2007,"I was somewhat intrigued by the first Final Destination and I thought the second was nothing but a carbon copy. Even though part three was not much different than the first two, I liked it a lot more. It must've been the mood I was in or the fact that I watched part three with someone.The usual occurred: there was a vision by a teenager, a few people averted death due to the antics of the visionary, then death began to actively pursue the death evaders and grotesquely take them one by one. This was exactly how parts one and two unfolded so why would anyone be anymore interested in part three over parts one and two? Well, I think those who liked the first two were looking for the exact same thing in the third and their wish was granted. I think FD3 offered more misdirection hence more surprise kills. It was no more gory, just more unpredictable as far as what the cause of death was going to be.",Final Destination 3
25,neil-476,Does what it says on the tin,7,11 January 2009,"If you go to see this movie, you're not expecting Shakespeare. You are expecting a succession of violent, gory deaths taking place in improbably elaborate fashion, all built around the premise established in the previous movies, namely that when people cheat Death, Death then puts extra effort into getting the masterplan back on track.And that's exactly what you get here - new crop of people, new crop of deaths, same basic scenario.And I'm guessing that that is going to leave you perfectly happy - it did me.I'll shout out a word of praise for Mary Elizabeth Winstead - she does a very good job of being attractive without being stunning, a pretty girl-next-door everywoman for easy audience identification, and able to carry a film like this with ease. Her performance is sympathetic without being irritatingly hysterical, and I am finding myself liking her more in each subsequent movie in which I see her.Mind you, then there are the two young ladies in the tanning beds....",Final Destination 3
26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,One of the best in the series,9,30 September 2015,"After a premonition saves a group on a roller coaster crash, the survivors begin to die off in a series of grisly accidents and forces the remaining friends to find a way of stopping the deaths from continuing.Overall this was quite an enjoyable and wholly entertaining part of the series. Like with the others, what really works well here is the setup for the initial premonition, as the scenery at the carnival is quite well-handled and really amps up the suspense in here. The party atmosphere is successfully blinded by the demonic statues, games and the different signs showing up around the park even before getting to the main roller coaster which is yet again is a rather imposing event which lets the action go on quite nicely with all the suspense around them. There's also the start of the film's best part here with its spectacular action scenes really carrying this one along with spectacular scenes that just overwhelm with the spectacle and the ingenuity to pull off the scenes here in the absolutely thrilling crash scene that occurs here. It comes off incredibly well and even plausible as to how the crash could occur in real like taken to an extreme in allowing the deaths to occur here in really great ways, and set up the later encounters quite well. There's plenty of big action encounters here from the sequence in the tanning salon that comes off incredibly cruel, the crash at the drive-up window and the insane tension at the hardware store makes this a notable sequence with all the different potential hazards at play before getting to the crazy death scene. There's also the grand finale at the celebration which features some thrilling scenes, a rather exciting horse-chase sequence through the grounds and really gets a great resolution to this one. Along with the usual high-quality gore for the kills, these here make this one quality enough to hold off the few small flaws here. The main issue here is that there's very little set-up for the kills which are just so quick and over so briefly that they don't have much in the way of suspense about them. This is compounded by the other factor here with the lame mystery about the photographs not being all that well-handled and it just doesn't have much intrigue about them. These here are what hold this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Nudity, Graphic Language and a non-bloody animal killing.",Final Destination 3
27,Wuchakk,"Decent, but now formulaic entry in this 'Dead Teenager' series",5,30 August 2014,"The first ""Final Destination"" movie in 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, as an invisible spirit. A group of people, mostly teens, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying the kids who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually an unlikely chain of events. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash, in the second it's a horrible highway pile-up while in this third entry it's a rollercoaster mishap.All of the movies in the five-film franchise tell the same basic story with different characters and minor nuances; all of them are of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on your preference for cast members and the death sequences (and the locations). Other than these factors they're all basically the same.Released in 2006, ""Final Destination 3"" has a quality doe-eyed heroine or 'final girl' in Mary Elizabeth Winstead. There are some other worthy female cast members, like Alexz Johnson, Chelan Simmons, Crystal Lowe and Amanda Crew. These five ladies represent perhaps the best assortment of women in the series yet.While it's true that you know exactly how this film plays out if you've seen the first two installments, or any of them, there are some highlights beyond the female cast. For instance, the rollercoaster accident is thrilling and rings true in light of real-life mishaps at amusement parks. There's also a horrifying tanning booth death sequence, which was done better in ""Urban Legends: Bloody Mary"" from the previous year (2005). Another death scene occurs at a warehouse where two of the protagonists work. I also liked how an extended sequence outside the teens' school takes place in the rain, which shows attention to detail (or making the best of a rainy day during shooting, whatever).For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most probably die in the sequel.In case you're interested, there's an interesting 20-minute documentary about ""Dead Teenager Movies"" on the 'extras' disk with Roger Ebert being a highlight.The film runs 93 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver area, as were all the Final Destination flicks, except the fourth one.GRADE: C+/B- (5.5/10)",Final Destination 3
28,The_Void,Here to hoping that there isn't a part 4!,3,29 July 2006,"I've already seen the first two Final Destination films, so naturally I had no interest in seeing this one...but what can you do when you're with a bunch of friends that all want to watch it? I guess it's a bit pointless to point out all the ineptitudes of this film, but since I've wasted ninety minutes of my life on it; I feel that I've earned the right. The 'Special Edition' DVD contains a feature that allows the viewer to change the order that the characters die in; and director James Wong obviously had this in mind when making the film, as the ridiculously over the top death scenes are just that; scenes in which someone is clearly and obviously going to die. The film is basically a very thin and highly unoriginal plot thread, which is peppered with such scenes, and the characters that manage to survive so they make it to the next scene don't have any effect on this whatsoever....thus making it all a little pointless, as the film is basically just a collection of sequences that see people die in gory and stupid ways. This may be OK for some people, but for anyone who takes their horror seriously; Final Destination 3 is a travesty.The plot is exactly the same as the other two films, in that we start with an over the top scene in which a lot of people escape death, and then see them all get their comeuppance later on. The stupidity of the plot shines through more in this film than in the two previous ones, and the idea of death coming back to claim it's intended victims is pathetic, as if 'death' really is an all powerful force...why would it go to the trouble of setting up a bizarre sequence of events to decapitate/burn/crush these people, when it could simply give them a heart attack or some other less strenuous method of death? Of course, this series is renowned for its death scenes...but by part three, it really has run its course and this film is completely needless. The gore isn't bad, however, but most of the special effects look hokey and silly, which doesn't do a film that is already hokey and silly many favours. The film rips off many better films, such as The Omen, and every time there's a stolen idea; it just reminds the audience how bad this film is. Overall, fans of the original will probably like this as well...but it's not recommended to anyone over the age of 14.",Final Destination 3
29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Final Destination 3,6,22 February 2006,"I wonder why I missed the first two movies of the franchise, given that I'm a fan of gore (the bloodier the merrier). But you need not have watched the first two movies in order to enjoy Final Destination 3, as it's pretty much a stand-alone movie utilizing the same premise.Which is when someone actually somehow foresees the future, where something tragically fatal will happen to him/her. They pull out from the situation, and following along (whether they like it or not) are a few others. The tragedy happens, and they all escape death. Death is naturally upset, and continues to kill off the characters who were supposed to die.But of course, if you can cheat death again, you're off the hook. You know you're in for a good, satisfactory ride when the opening credits are stuffed with relative unknowns, meaning they are the fodder who will die in ways imagined by the writer. Co-writer and director James Wong, who was involved in the original movie, returns to extend his vision of the franchise.There are numerous references to the earlier movies, like the number 180 which pops up, and also to serve as research material for the characters in FD3 (hard to imagine that the first movie was SIX years ago!). Nifty special effects are also the hallmark of the FD movies, which bring to life the filmmaker's sadistic vision of deaths in various ways from being fried alive to huge objects becoming giant human-swatters.The movie also sticks to the usual slasher/horror conventions, of knowing that bimbos will die in the most idiotic way ever. Don't go looking for logic in the elaborate setup before character deaths - it's like every implausible element that will impact or contribute towards someone's death, will be looked into. The coincidence might make you shake your head at the sheer audacity of it all, but then, if Death's looking for you, all angles must be covered, and you must die. Like right now. In a fashionably bloody manner to boot, as if to punish you for having cheated initially.Being rated NC-16 here however, meant that certain scenes had to be cut. Strangely, suggestive scenes like a character licking the boobs of a nude woman keychain, and the bimbos stripping down to their birthday suits, get the snip. But the glorious bloodbath (save one) get shown uncut. As the show progresses, you get to see more. So I guess if the movie is rated for violence and gore, most nudity will get cut off, and probably vice versa? One wonders.Does this movie scream sequel again? Maybe, if the filmmakers can come up with some more creative ways to die, in bloody good fashion, then perhaps the franchise would probably continue. If you're really hard up and stayed until the end, you'll just be rewarded with a maniacal laughter.",Final Destination 3
30,StevePulaski,Three for three,8,10 August 2011,"The third installment of Final Destination is starting to show some ware and tear on its jeans, but sneaks by with a recommendation simply because of its formula, its cast, and some of the most unique death scenes of the series. The cast is charismatic together, the plot remains the same, and the death scenes, like I said, are of a Rube Goldberg creation.The story, I shouldn't repeat, but I'm going to. Young Wendy (Winstead) has a premonition before boarding a roller coaster at an amusement park with her friends that it will derail because of a dropped camcorder, killing all of them. Wendy forces various people off the coaster and winds up causing a scene that, once more, becomes reality as the coaster derails. The gang now realizes that Death is angry for them once again disrupting his ""carefully"" concocted plan, and now they are going to die in the way they were meant to on the roller coaster.I don't care if Final Destination 10 hits theaters in 2018, I will still see all these films like the makers want me to. I have nothing against these films, but even creativity runs dry. One has to think, how much longer can they come up with inventive ways to kill people? The answer is many. Even in its third resurrection, the kills in this are good. There is one at a fast food restaurant that is far-fetched, but gruesome fun. And another unsettling destruction in a subway.The DVD version of the film, the ""Choose Their Fate"" edition only, gives you the option to find out what happened to two of the luckies in Final Destination 2. Nothing special, and I won't spoil the two names, but it's good to know at least the series is going above and beyond.Final Destination 3 is a lot murkier than previous installments. This could possibly be because of James Wong returning as director. The first movie had an essence of dark in it, but still remained a little neutral in the tonality. A lot of this is very dark in its scenery, and a lot of the characters have meaner, less-optimistic personalities than the first two. No problem, there, I like my horror dark, as long as the picture is view-able. It's just strange how they'd want the series to go from neutral, neutral, dark, then downright comical come time for The Final Destination.What really stands out from FD3, that doesn't in the other films, is the soundtrack. Many of the songs are borrowed from the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas music library from fictional stations like the country themed K-Rose, and the desert rock oriented K-DST. I loved that game, and especially the music. The icing on the cake is the, yes dark, cover of The O'Jays' Love Train to conclude the film. All I can say is they knew how to pick the music for this.I'm giving Final Destination 3 three stars because the imaginative mind still lurks inside the series, and it hasn't gone down just yet. I always said, between the three year gap between the third and the forth movie that they should cease making them. Leave the trilogy, a solid, dependable one. As long as these films rake in the cash, they'll spit them out like a broken vending machine. There is always some sort of wart that branches off of a film franchise, and I want Final Destination to remain wart-less.Starring: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ryan Merriman, and Amanda Crew.

31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Could've been better,6,18 November 2006,"I was so extremely excited about seeing Final Destination 3, especially since I loved the first and the second. Also, how cool is it that there is a roller coaster death scene? I go to amusement parks every year, so this was going to be a cool story for me. Unfortunately, the third installment just turned into another corny horror movie that turned completely predictable and the lead actress annoyed me, that's not a good thing.Wendy is the new girl with the golden gift of seeing her wonderful but not so wonderful future. She and her fellow seniors are on a trip at an amusement park, she has a vision that the ride she's about to go on is going to horribly break and kill everyone. Her and several others get off the ride and of course, the ride breaks killing her boyfriend and her best friend. And if you've seen the first two, you can guess where this is going, one by one who was supposed to be killed is going to get killed tragically.While the deaths were still pretty cool, I wasn't as shocked as the first two Final Destination films. This film turned into MTV or at least a clearasol commercial with these corny actors. Not to mention that I found the 9/11 reference completely tacky and insulting, it was just plain unnecessary. So, that took off a couple of points that could've earned the movie a 7, but now it's a...6/10",Final Destination 3
32,KineticSeoul,"Watching it on DVD made it worth seeing, but not by much",5,13 August 2011,"Watching this on DVD makes it worth a watch, mainly because you can sort of choose the outcome. Which is the most fun part about this movie. It's kinda like those Goosebumps books where you can sort of choose the direction of where the story goes by turning to different pages by the choices the reader is given. Anyways that is basically the only positive thing about this movie, and the premise is now getting old. Yeah it worked for the last two movies and it seems they are not even trying anymore. The whole movie just seemed cheap compared to the previous movies in this franchise. Almost nothing about this movie is intriguing. And I know this happens in a lot of movies but the characters didn't seem like high school students at all but much older. Another flaw of this movie is how almost none of the characters are even likable so you could careless what happens to them. There is also noticeable plot holes that is just so obvious. The 3rd time is not the charm for this franchise, it is worth a look if there is no other movies worth seeing but that is about it. Not super terrible but not good either.5.5/10",Final Destination 3

Slasher films almost always have the same M.O. and that's not a bad thing but to find a unique one that started in 2000...Final Destination stands alone. In this third installment, six years after the original (three after the second one) it continues it's own M.O. and continues to impress and be a really great series that is possibly one of the most disturbing and scary films out there just for it's sole realness to it. Final Destination works like a comedian...ie: It's funny because it's true...well this is Horror because it's true. No other film makes you think hard about every single object, situation and chain reaction you can possibly think of.The acting has never been A+ in the series and still isn't in this one. I mean it isn't bad and the cast is definitely sufficient but they aren't what holds together the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead takes the lead role as the girl who sees horrible visions of death. She's quite intense and a good ""scream queen"" but nothing stand out. Ryan Merriman is the lead actor playing narrowly saved friend Kevin Fischer. With a little study (and some mention of the original film) the two of them set out to try and save everyone who got off the roller coaster and therefore is now on Death's radar to be knocked off. Anyone else in the film is basically expendable as proved by their rather horrific and well thought out deaths. One of the most unique things about The Final Destination series is that the killer is the same throughout but they never have to put him in any physical form...the killer is death...period. Perhaps some day when they are ready to drain this series they can put him in some sort of physical form but until then it's enough to know that it exists.Original director James Wong returns to the helm for the third installment and it's obvious he knows the script and ideas quite well. If slasher flicks try to find the most unique deaths...well Final Destination hones that to a science. You won't find any more unique and gory deaths than in this film or the previous ones. There are some jaw dropping, cover your eyes death scenes that will make you cringe. Certainly make sure you see the original films before checking out number three but this one is worth seeing in the theaters for sure. It is one of the best Horror Films out there right now and it makes horror out of every day events and settings. The first one was the horrific plane accident, the second film was that deadly, nightmarish car accident/pile up and now the third installment will make you never look at a roller coaster again. Definitely worth seeing for fans of gore, blood, and horror!!! I will mention that the film is deadly short...haven't seen a movie this short in a long long time but it doesn't ruin it any just worth mentioning. 8/10",Final Destination 3
35,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"The concept's pretty inspiring, but if you've seen the first one you've really already seen it",4,23 March 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits A group of teenage friends visit an amusement park. A girl has a premonition that a scary looking ride will go deadly wrong if they ride on it. Knowing it to be true but powerless to stop it, she is forced to just stand back and watch the inevitable happen. But for the survivors the nightmare has only just begun- death itself is back and ready to take another group of annoyingly bratty American teenagers.I liked the promotional poster for Final Destination 3 and I could relate to the lead girl's fear of the theme park ride as I've experienced a similar sort of worry before going on such rides in the past. But I never saw FD2 and having seen this, I'm not sure I want to bother. Although the story is interesting, it plays out almost identically to that of the original, meaning you've just tuned in to watch the various kids meat their respective blood-splattered deaths in their various clever ways by the end. It's engaging enough for what it is, but it ultimately boils down to a carbon copy of the original. **",Final Destination 3
36,MLDinTN,if you liked the first one...,7,17 February 2007,"you'll like this one. The movie has the same concept as the first 2. Nothing new as far as plot. There is plenty of gore in some very unique deaths. It's fun. And it looks quite painful. Who would want to burn alive in a tanning bed! The first 20 minutes were amazing with the roller coaster sequence. Parts looked very fake, but other parts had good special effects. I wouldn't want to see someones lower half on the seat next to me.You would think if they figured out how they would die from the pictures, then they would just stay in their room and not go anywhere, but that would make too much sense.FINAL VERDICT: This is for all gore fans. It's short and worth watching.",Final Destination 3
37,CuriosityKilledShawn,"This franchise is dead, as I predicted. How ironic!",3,19 February 2006,"'Anticipation of dead is worse than death itself.' These are the immortal words of Steven Seagal in Hard to Kill. Had he seen any of the movies in this franchise I'm sure he would have changed it to 'Final Destination is worse than death itself.' A babe (the very cute Mary Elizabeth Winstead) predicts a roller-coaster will crash send many stereotyped, stock-teenage characters to their early/deserved death. She flips and demands to be let off, taking a few others with her. She was right, the train comes off the tracks and everyone dies. Only we don't even see it! The survivors start dying in freak accidents, the secrets of their deaths revealed in their last photographs taken by stock-babe at the carnival before the accident. Thus, starts a plot we've seen twice before as babe and stock-sympathetic 'hunk' go around all the other survivors trying to convince them to stay safe or something. But, as usual, they are complete idiots and don't listen and soon enough their brain matters have painted the ceilings, walls and floors after some overly-contrived death set-up. Yawn! I'll be open right away and tell you that I thought that the first Final Destination was horrendous. It came out in a time where teen horror films starring actors well into their twenties were in high abundance and watching 'teenagers' die one by one was cool again. This may sound hypocritical by a 'Friday the 13TH' fan but Final Destination's morbid fascination with brutally killing people is a little unsettling. I'm not sure if we're supposed to laugh or scream at this stuff. And despite using the word 'brutal' we don't really see that much. It's the method of death rather than the mess of it.The second film was a bit better, but hardly brilliance. I'll attribute that to David R. Ellis who is a better director than James Wong, who returns for this movie. Along with The One (another rotten film) he's proving himself to be a bit of a hack incapable of directing anything other than brain-dead eye-candy. He does shoot this film in widescreen, which gives it a bigger scope over the other two (I found the bland and flat photography of the first film to be one of the worst things about it) but he still doesn't fill it with anything interesting or even the slightest bit of atmosphere. Hardly impressive for a film about death himself.I hope this is the end of the line and Final Destination has reached its final destination. Any more entries in this series can only be outright robbery. Dick Turpin at least wore a mask! As more of these films come out, the more I am reminded of Police Academy. We keep paying our hard earned pennies for this guff but all New Line are really doing is changing the poster and reserving the bore they did before. Well not anymore! This goat has been milked dry. The dead horse cannot be flogged any further. Money cannot be made from this old rope.This franchise is DEAD!",Final Destination 3

41,paulclaassen,"MUCH better than FD2, but still not as good as FD1.",6,24 April 2020,"Here we go again! James Wong is back in the director's chair, and 'Final Destination 3' is significantly better than its predecessor.In the first film, the disaster happened on a plane. In the second, on a highway. And now, on a rollercoaster. Due to the confined space of a rollercoaster, the disaster scene was unfortunately not as impressive. The photography and editing was so quick that it was easy to miss what was actually going on. When the premonition was over, the actual disaster was over before you could say ""rollercoaster"".At least the reason the victims are in the predicament is better explained - and makes more sense - than in 'Final Destination 2'. Here they are a group of school friends - similar to the characters in the first film. It is the same recipe (for disaster) all over again. From the dialogue to the events, its pretty much a rehash of what we've seen in FD1 and FD2. Therefore - again - this film is only a vessel to make money, and please those who haven't seen the first two films. The death scenes are probably the only thing making us come back for more. As sick as that sounds, it's a weird thing called entertainment.As a standalone film, it certainly isn't bad. If there was nothing to compare it to, I'd even say it was great. The clues to the death scenes are perfectly planned and well set-up - much better than FD2. The acting is also far better. With every movie in the series, the killings get more graphic and gory. These effects and make-up are excellent. The Drive Thru accident scene was spectacular!The only thing that annoyed me immensely, was - again - the addition of comic relief characters. (At least it wasn't as bad as in FD2). Why do they insist on adding them? That's what comedies are for, or horror comedies - and the FD series is neither.The final act is a thrill ride of action, chaos and mayhem - from the fair to the train ride. Fantastic, action-packed finale!https://paulsmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2020/04/24/final-destination-3/",Final Destination 3
42,sol-,Death by Photo,5,27 October 2017,"After a premonition allows her to save her friends from a fatal roller-coaster crash, a teenager becomes convinced that Death still has a plan to get them in this third film in the 'Final Destination' franchise. The writing-directing team of Glen Morgan and James Wong return to the helm here (after the reigns to Part Two were given elsewhere) and they deliver several memorable novelty deaths, with a tanning salon sequence sticking out in a particular. The overall film though feels like a missed opportunity for Morgan and Wong who do not delve any deeper into the mythology of how Death works, why certain individuals get premonitions and the seemingly sadistic need of Death to make the experience as gruesome as possible. Morgan and Wong do, however, add an additional element of certain photographs that allow the protagonists to predict the ways their surviving friends will later perish - but then this only really furthers the mystery and suspense rather than the mythology behind the series. That said, a scene in which they enter a gym and spot several different possible ways in which their friend could die (in accordance with his photograph) comes with a deliciously dark comedic streak. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also as appealing as ever, however, this third entry sorely lacks the twist connections to Part One that made the second film such a memorable experience.",Final Destination 3

As you can understand is about the same story with the other two previous ""Final Destination"". I liked this movie because it has suspense and many action scenes. I also liked it because of the special and visual effects which I believe that were really good and there were better than the special effects which used in the two previous movies.Finally I have to tell you that with this movie you will have a really great time and if you like movies with a group of people who are in danger and staff like that then you will love it.",Final Destination 3
44,Floated2,Worth Watching,8,9 June 2013,"All the fears of riding a roller-coaster are exploited in the freak accident that makes up the opening salvo for what's to come, and though it's as impressive as the highway pile-up in the last film, it's actually tame compared to what Death has planned for those that survive. But first, we meet the graduating class of McGinley High, celebrating at the amusement park with all the usual suspects in attendance: the cocky jock, the bitchy popular girls, the chauvinist sex maniac, the goth outcasts, and the film's heroine Wendy, a control freak left sitting on the coaster with her best friend's boyfriend Kevin, who somehow sees that the roller-coaster is fated to crash killing all. She causes enough of a ruckus to save them both as well as five others from their tragic fate, but by now, all students have heard the story of Flight 180 and the survivors who died mysteriously afterwards. Using photos taken by Wendy before the accident, they try to decipher the clues of what Death has planned, and of course, it doesn't take long for Death to get to work reclaiming his victims. The two ladies are quickly killed off in a tanning salon accident, offering a great visual gag, then the jock gets his in the weight room, and the goths' job at the hardware store offers plenty of opportunities for grisly deaths.In most of the cases, you expect something to happen, but you never know where the kills will come from. If you try to guess, you'll probably end up being wrong. It's the build-up to these deaths, and the various twists that keep things exciting, offering plenty of shocks and surprises with each character's denounement. As hard as it may be to believe, some of them are even gorier in their realism than the last movie. By the time it gets to the town's county fair, Death has run amuck trying to tidy up loose ends, creating a fast-paced series of kills and close calls. Although there seems to be a big chunk of story missing after that, the epilogue is even more satisfying than the one in the previous sequel.As a rewatch 03/12/20' this film remains a great watch and one of the better of the series. It isn't as horror as the original but what makes it stand out are the characters, and the more so relatable feel. Final Destination 3 has the most feel of nostalgia of the franchise, and could be a reason as to why this entry is the most loved by many.",Final Destination 3
45,johnnyboyz,The Chemistry is Still Working - Just,6,12 February 2006,"When I first saw the first Final Destination film a couple of years ago, I thought it was a good attempt. The plot was rather unique in the sense that I hadn't come across a film with similar narrative ideas like this one before and the pacing was impressive, leaving it all down to, in the end, 'fate' being the films antagonist rather than an actual person or 'monster' as it frequently is in horror films. So, with this in mind and commenting on the third installment of Final Destination, I wish I could say the same positive things and have felt the same positive emotions; unfortunately, I can't but it's not all bad.The pacing of the film is actually quite quick, in fact it seems to fly past at just about the same speed as the roller-coaster at the beginning. This is a strange sensation as each of the 'murders' is drawn out in an ultimately annoying fashion. I use this term as you KNOW the order and you KNOW they're going to die and even when one character starts to twig something involving photographs she took the night of the accident, that in itself starts to give the game away a little prematurely.The shock and surprise value has since all but disappeared since the first film but the eerie atmosphere and strange feeling of suspicion as to how exactly the death will be set in motion is still there. Then comes the gore factor, which most people in the cinema found particularly amusing. Each death is primed and primed to the point that when it actually happens, the added gore of decapitation is what surprises you and although this may seem like a good idea on paper, it doesn't really do much except get a few laughs out of people. For me, it was only the one or two really gory deaths that got a sound out of me, and that was purely through shock factor. These involved a nail gun and a cooling fan; I'll let you make up for yourself what you think happened.Although Final Destination 3 isn't a bad film, it's got all the little annoying flaws which keep it from being a really good film. Typical American teenage dialogue with characters so stereotypical, you'd think they'd have been stamped out of Hollywood by this day and age of film-making. The logic of certain characters comes into play as well. If the smell of danger or the sense of threat is beginning to loiter in the area and you've managed to work it out, why stay there? Why not just leave? I know it's 'only a movie' but I really was shaking my head and screaming out at the screen (internally) at the intelligence of some of the character's actions and re-actions to certain events.These technical 'glitches' aside, I think you can enjoy the film for what it is: 'Man vs. Fate' in an idea just begging to be exploited on the big screen for people who like their jumps and gore in a pretty good plot when you think about it even though it's six years old.",Final Destination 3
46,TheMovieDiorama,"Final Destination 3 is three times the creativity, but three times the predictability.",4,8 May 2018,"When a franchise like 'Final Destination' takes an idea and utilises the same narrative structure throughout all of the sequels, you can't help but feel cheated by Death himself. However, you know what they all say *cue London accent* ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it...init"". This third instalment is more of the same. A group of friends cheat death from a freak accident involving a rollercoaster, they each slowly die in other accidents in the sequential order they would've died if they stayed on the ride. If you've seen its predecessors then you know exactly what you are getting into. Non-existent character development, a predictable plot and a series of absolute convenient accidents that are timed so precisely that you just have to admire the creativity involved. These accidents rely on so many components falling into place, whether it be a shelf locking two temperature rising sun beds together or an unmanned truck rolling down a hill and accurately slotting into a drive-thru, that actually they no longer become surprising. Unlike the first film, they aren't unexpected all. Death has clearly meticulously planned these gruesome scenes for our pleasure, so I thank him for that. Aside from that, this film has no substance whatsoever. The characters theorise the plot's structure before the first freak accident as they try to warn others that they are next in line, leaving no excitement or thrills to be had. At the narrative's core, it becomes predictably boring. That's certainly not Wong's fault who does showcase some excellent directing techn...wait, he wrote this too? Well, in that case it is his fault. The franchise's structure has now run its course. Inventive but lacking in substance and thrills. If only the producers had a premonition in 2009, we wouldn't have had even worse sequels. Oh, before I forget, what I will say is that I will never ever ever go on a sun bed. That scene scarred me for life when I was younger...or should I say, it was burnt into my mind...",Final Destination 3

As you may expect, someone has the premonition before it happens and manages to escape and prevent more people from it. Unfortunately, not everyone escapes. That's the first part of the movie.Then the second part of the movie focuses on ""creative"" death sequences of the people who survived the tragedy. Expect deaths with plenty of gore, hints about how they're gonna happen, and more tragedies. Highlights: the gym sequence, the sun bath thing, the couple who die in the factory, and the last sequence with the crashing subway train.Part three of the movie centers on the last premonition sequence that unfortunately shows that Death always has the reason...Entertaining Horror flick dedicated for teenagers and/Or fans of the new wave of Horror.",Final Destination 3

This time they make a wise decision of getting off the roller-coaster, and buy themselves a little time. Like the second one, we have a cast of unknowns, a couple who may'be made it to a higher rank of success, with their acting career, determined. A couple of players weren't bad either, (standouts) but as with No 3 in the franchises, rarely do they work, as really by this time, they've done their dash. But who am I to judge as Psycho 3 and Deathwish 3 are my favourite out of those series. If a Final Destination fan, in no way, don't be out off my review. I did stop at this number of the franchise. I still found it very entertaining, but the thrills and suspense, gave way to so obvious predictability, it wasn't funny, or had me in unbelief, as concerning the scene and instances, prior to the victim's fates.

I love that even though all the Final Destination movies have the same premise, that they can change it up so well. So it's not the exact same thing.In this movie, we see yet another group of people survive a tragic accident. This time, it's a roller coaster crash. Wendy and her friends are all at their school carnival. They go to ride this really scary roller coaster and then when they start moving, they crash. Wendy wakes up, and the roller coaster hasn't started moving yet. She screams and cries to get off the ride. Maintenance workers let her off, as well as some other passengers. Then she watches the roller coaster go, and then, unfortunately crash, just like in her vision. And sadly, her boyfriend and best friend died in the accident. Then mysteriously, everyone who got off the ride, starts dying in terrible, tragic ways. Wendy finds out about Flight 180 and the pile-up a year later. And she believes that's what's happening here. The deaths don't seem to be in any particular order, at least I don't think they mention it. But Wendy discovers that there is a way to find out how someone will die.

A roller coaster would the scariest place to have those visions. Those two bronze babes, really put up the sex appeal in that movie. That tanning owner should have known better than to use a tanning cream as a wedge. That's not solid enough. At least he won't be held reliable for their deaths because, he's not a fault. The other deaths the people suffered were far more gruesome than ever expected from the first ""FD"". The celebration was really the bomb when that atheist has the boom lowered. Everything went as planned, death is inescapable. Nailed, impaled, roasted, toasted, or even weighed on, the horror never stops. My personal favorite other than the tanning accident is that runaway truck.

In spite of some mighty impressive, super-gory, rapid-fire disaster scenes (with lots of splattered blood & guts & mangled bodies thrown everywhere), Final Destination 3 (FD3, for short) really wasn't much of a horror-movie roller-coaster ride since, right from the start, the viewer (unless they're an idiot) knew exactly what was gonna happen every single step of the way.Believe me, there was not even the tiniest inkling of a surprise in this utterly tired and shamelessly rehashed tale of freak accidents and fate's intervention.In fact, some of the ""freak"" accidents got to be so over-the-top and preposterously ridiculous that this viewer (who was far from being terrified) couldn't help but laugh out loud at the utter absurdity of it all. (I mean, give me a break, already!) Besides that - FD3 also had a terrible knack of gleefully exploiting every despicable & stereotypical behaviourism and character trait in the book of those precious, little darlings, better known as today's self-absorbed, snot-nosed, grate-on-your-nerves teenagers.

53,dee.reid,The battle of the three,8,29 July 2006,"You know, I guess that in the end it doesn't matter that we're all going to die someday. But I think that what does matter is HOW we die, and how we get there. The ""Final Destination"" films were first created by director James Wong (whose most notable credit is his work on ""The X-Files"") in 2000 and David R. Ellis directed the sequel in 2003, and now Wong is back for this year's ""Final Destination 3.""The Dead Teenager genre is probably the most hyper-active and repetitive of all horror movie genres. You got the brave heroine, her stupid friends, a killer, lots of gory special effects and deaths, and if you have sex, you're going to die; for further reference, I suggest you see Randy in the self-conscious ""Scream"" films, themselves a parody of the genre.But what I find to be the real genius of ""Final Destination"" and its sequels is the fact that our killer, Death itself, remains faceless, an unseen force in the room that acts with Rube Goldberg-like mannerisms by constructing such elaborately gruesome mechanics to dispatch unwary victims. If these devices were stripped of their gory excess and seriousness, you'd be left with three movies (and possibly more) that contain a perverse sense of humor that will have you laughing and later kicking yourself for doing so.I mean, teens die in some pretty grisly fashions in this third entry, seemingly building on the template constructed in the second feature for pure shock value with increasingly gory deaths; let's see, things are kicked off with a premonition of a fatal roller coaster accident at a carnival by teenager Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and her friends and other survivors start getting knocked off by Death, whether it be by a decapitation, turning a tanning bed into a microwave oven, there's a rather nasty incident with a nail gun, and those fireworks are looking pretty lethal. So it's up to Wendy to save herself and others by piecing together the cryptic clues in her digital camera, which she had been using to take pictures for her school's yearbook.The only foreseeable problem with Death as the villain is that we as audience members know what's going to happen before any of the teens in the movie do. We know that when the ominous music swells up, someone's about to bite the dust. (That's the point, I guess.) We also have to contend with the somewhat ironic, self-conscious dialogue, which is another aspect that helps keep things above water. These movies are starting to run out of steam and the only reason we keep coming back are the increasingly gory ways Hollywood devises to keep killing teenagers.Looks like Death just met its match.8/10",Final Destination 3

I did like the turn in story, where Wendy finds that she can see how people will died in Pictures.Death is back again and start to kill them in nasty, gory ways (not as gory a FD2).

55,drownnnsoda,"The First and Second All Over Again, Not Bad At All Though.",8,28 August 2006,"""Final Destination 3"" is basically the first and second films rehashed again, this time with more creative ways to off it's innocent characters. This film concerns a girl named Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is having a fun night out with her friends at the local carnival. The group of kids decide to ride a gigantic roller-coaster. But when Wendy has a premonition of it's horrible crash, she gets off quickly, with a few others. Unfortunately, her boyfriend doesn't make it off the ride, and it crashes, killing everyone on the train. Soon afterward, those who survived (thanks to Wendy) begin to die off one by one. While looking at some photos she took at the carnival, she realizes that there are subtle clues in her images that can foretell what the survivor's deaths will be. Now, she and a classmate, Kevin, must race against time to save those who are next on Death's list. I saw this film during it's theater run back in February, and ended up going twice with friends, and found it to be an all-around fun movie. Again, this film is the first and second basically re-done, but this installment offers a little more. The whole photograph-foretelling-death idea was creative, I thought it was a unique way to help tell the story. The roller-coaster-crash at the beginning itself is worth your money, it was really cool to watch and was very well filmed. As expected, there are even gorier and more horrible ways to die than ""Final Destination"" and ""Final Destination 2"" had to offer. The tanning booth scene with the typical ditsy beach girls was pretty nasty, and the nailgun scene was just plain brutal. The actors were good, I think everyone gave fair performances and created likable characters. Mary Elizabeth Winstead leads the cast in her first major role, and proves that she has talent. Ryan Merriman (of ""Halloween: Resurrection"") is the secondary lead, and also performs well. The film's conclusion was pretty much the same as the ending to both of the previous films, and it leaves it open for yet another sequel, which may or may not be made.Overall, ""Final Destination 3"" is a fun little horror movie with some fair suspense and, of course, some more inventive ways to kill off characters. As for the ending, it hints that there may be another sequel. Will they make one? Who knows. I like these movies, but I think three times around is good enough for me. 8/10.",Final Destination 3
56,davispittman,Better than I expected,7,29 November 2015,"Final Destination 3 is the only final destination movie I have seen. I caught it on Cinemax late last night and thought it might be fun. This film was fun and pretty entertaining to watch. The acting was actually pretty good here, I wasn't expecting a whole heck of a lot from the actors. It is a little bit predictable, but it was still entertaining nonetheless. Amanda Crew was very impressive, i really loved her in the role. And Ryan merriman was impressive as well, I really loved the casting in this movie, I usually am not a humongous fan of horror film castings, but this movie had great actors in it. The visual effects were pretty well done. I didn't like a couple of the deaths and how graphic they were, didn't need to see some of that. I also didn't care to see the blonde girls's boobs in the tanning bed, unnecessary. But the script and dialogue was well written I thought. And it was entertaining, I had a pretty good time. I wasn't a huge fan of how the film ended though. 7/10.",Final Destination 3
57,hu675,Premise is certainly familiar and offers nothing new but expects for some neat death sequences and it's quite entertaining.,8,11 November 2007,"Wendy (Mary Elizebeth Winstead) is a High School senior, who's nearly done with her high-school year and can't wait to start her new life in College. For the High School seniors, they are treated for a day at the Theme Park. When Wendy starts to have a premonition on the roller-coaster ride. She sees herself, her boyfriend (Jesse Moss), her best friend (Gina Holden) and the seniors (Kevin Merriman, Kris Lemche, Alexz Johnson, Amanda Crew, Texas Battle, Sam Easton, Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe) dies in horrible deaths. While Wendy starts freaking out in the ride before it's start, most of the students gets out of the ride expect her boyfriend and her best friend are staying in the ride. But only in a couple of days, they died as Mary thought they would. Now a couple of weeks, once High School is finish. One of the Seniors, Kevin thinks that Wendy's premonition is no accident. Which it happened before with other students or adults experienced this same kind of oddity. Wendy starts slowly believing it, when she starts seeing odd photos from the digital camera. She taken pictures from the unexpected day with other seniors. Now the other seniors are now dying in bizarre mysterious deaths. Now Wendy and Kevin are trying to warm them to no effect at all. Now Wendy and Kevin are trying to find out, while the other seniors will die and including their upcoming deaths. Which they will try to cheat death to stay alive even longer.Directed by James Wong (Final Destination, The One) made an amusing, guilty pleasure sequel of the ""Final Destination"" films. Which it is the third of the popular series and it will probably be the last as well. Wong's third film offers plenty of black comedy and some thrilling visual moments but after after watching the two previous ""Final Destination"" movies, this one offers nothing new. But it has creative death sequences, which some of extremely funny and sightly disturbing as well. This movie was originally going to be filmed in 3-D but too bad... New Line Cinema got cold feet about this idea. Which it could give this series some new dimensions to the series. The cast are game as always as the previous two films, special effects are quite good and the gore sequences do delivers as always.This third movie of the series offers an two disc set. Which the bonus features are excellent. Disc 1 has an terrific anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong DTS 6.1 ES Surround Sound (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1 EX). DVD also has an fairly amusing commentary by co-writer/producer/director:Wong, co-writer/producer:Glen Morgan (Black Christmas ""2006"" and Willard ""2003"") and cinematographer:Robert MacLachlan (Cursed). Disc 1 also offers ""Choose Their Fate!"" option:which offers alternate death sequences, extended scenes and even trivia of what happen to the characters of ""Final Destination 2"".Disc 2 offers an fascinating 88 minute documentary ""Kill Shot:The Making of Final Destination 3"", three fascinating featurettes, extended scene and more. After seeing ""Final Destination 3"" in theaters last year. I was pleasantly surprised by how vicious and cruel are some of these death sequences for a major studio horror movie. Which the MPAA seems to have no problem with this, since this is only a fantasy horror picture. Which most of the time, the MPAA will attack on violent movies. When they are done realistically and vividly. Fans of ""Final Destination"" movies will certainly have a blast watching this but i also felt this third film of the series starts to run out of gas. If this is the last of the series, this ended well. Especially since the filmmakers:Wong and Morgan came back working on the third film. Since they were working on the underrated remake of ""Willard"" at the time, when ""Final Destination 2"" was getting made. It's good guilty pleasure fun feature and horror fans will certainly relish it. Listen closely to the voice of Tony Todd in some scenes. Which he had an memorable bit-parts in the two previous ""Final Destination"" pictures. Super 35. (****/*****).",Final Destination 3

I liked the first one a lot, I thought the second one was a bit convoluted but still enjoyable, but I found this third entry to have all the good-points of the first film, and then some. The great thing about this kind of series, is that this concept could go on forever, as long as the script-writers keep coming up with inventive kill-scenes and don't let plot get too much in the way of the film...If you've seen the others, then you know the plot: Somebody has a premonition about the gory, violent death of their friends, and then they come true...That's the beauty of this series - it's all set-ups for suspenseful and violent kill-scenes. This is one of the few sets of films where gore actually makes the films what they are. Forget storyline, forget characterization, it's all about death in brutal fashion. For gore fans, there are more inventive and brutal death scenes than you can shake a hack-saw at...roller-coaster mass destruction, nailgun annihilation, train-wreck decapitation, and tanning-bed immolation - just to name a few. I dare anyone to tell me why they didn't dig the f!ck out of this one. I think that FINAL DESTINATION 3 will be of interest from the most novice to the most hardcore horror fan.

60,fertilecelluloid,Third entry in an interesting series is predictable but fun,6,4 April 2006,"""Final Destination 3"" continues an interesting horror series in which the usual expository material that occurs between the on-screen mayhem doesn't exist because the series is ABOUT the deaths, it's about clever ways to cinematically kill off teenagers. This starts with a nicely executed roller-coaster tragedy. The kids who don't buy the farm know they're still gonna get it, so the rest of the film depicts all of them getting it and getting it real good. Since it's R-rated, we get some excellent gore and some very welcome nudity. The suspense is scene-specific because everything else is entirely predictable, but there's merit in the slick manipulation. Director James Wong knows how to shoot bloody mayhem and is particularly adept when it comes to depicting the domino effect of violence. The special effects are of a high calibre, the pacing is swift, and the performances from the warm props, who are not required to do much but react, are adequate.",Final Destination 3
61,aidanratesmovies,Dimwitted but entertaining sequel,6,9 September 2021,"Stupid and incredibly predictable, but somehow thrilling and weirdly entertaining- Final Destination improves upon the second film without having nearly enough brains to compare to the first. The writing in this film is definitely the biggest problem. Some things are quite clever, and I really enjoy how they did the premonition scenes throughout this one. However, the characters are remarkably bland- and the dialogue can often be atrocious. Not to mention many moments in their entirety are nearly ripped out of the previous films and re-done mechanically and formulaically to fit with the plot. It's frustrating where a rather original take on the franchise can also end up feeling so imaginative. The visuals are thankfully much better this time around, much less moody 2000's angst and more appealing to look at. The special effects are good and the film is easily the most entertaining film in the franchise so far. In the end, it's a familiar ride that is as predictable as it is entertaining. It oddly works more often than not, but you can't help but feel there could have been more done with this film instead of just milking the films before it.My Rating: 5.6/10.",Final Destination 3
62,Agent10,"The weakest of the three, but it still delivers the goods",7,22 July 2006,"Lets face it, in any horror series, the films become less about plot and more about gore. In no way is Final Destination 3 an original movie, but it's sardonic twist on comedy has allowed the franchise to take a different step.While the first two films were rather serious and dark, FD3 seemed to display the creative teams' desire to have some fun with the subject matter. The deaths are crazier and more outlandish than some of the brutality that is displayed in the previous films. Granted, FD2 had the best opening death scene of the three, FD3 did it's best to continue the tradition.The only weakness the film really had was the lack of true character development. While in many cases, this could be considered a bad thing, not for this series. I truly believe critics had it out for this film, simply because the whole concept of blood and guts type of horror films has somewhat gone by the wayside. But then again, this film delivered what it promised, and for the fans of this series, they weren't disappointed.",Final Destination 3
63,a_chinn,Glen Morgan and James Wong return to their franchise,5,20 May 2017,"""X-Files"" veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong return to the franchise they created and make a third film that's about as good as the original, but that's not saying too much since the first film was kind of a mixed bag. Completely ignoring the first two films, this one starts with an entirely new set of teens, led by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who while taking pictures at the carnival with her new fangled digital camera has a premonition of death that she and her friends are all about to be killed on a roller-coaster. As with the prior films, they ""cheat"" death by not going on the roller-coaster that soon kills a slew of people and they are then each killed or nearly killed in various elaborate sequences. Wong and Morgan do come up with more interesting of sequences and build better suspense than part two, and they actually do improve on the first film with having a more likable of leading character in Winstead, though credit probably goes to Winstead and not Wong and Morgan (though Wong and Morgan probably do get credit for including a Joey Ramone bobble-head in Winstead's bedroom). As with the other films, this isn't a classic, but is watchable for horror fans.",Final Destination 3
64,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Final Destination 3 (2006),3,13 December 2011,"Unlike the original, and even the second film, there is nobody to care about here. Dumb bitches, a pervert, angry black guy, sinister goth, whiny sister, etc. It got to the point where these characters were so stereotypical, that I couldn't even enjoy their death scenes. Granted, I want to see awesome deaths, but that doesn't mean I should necessarily want the characters to die. I should have mixed emotions about it all. Anyways, the opening roller coaster isn't as inventive as previous tragedies. After all, you pretty much just fly off and die. After that, all the deaths you can see coming. In fact, now we have pictures that predict how people will die. Part of the fun should be analysing the scene and thinking ""How is this going to end?"". With this film though, we know how each death will end up. Or they are so sudden we didn't have time to relish in all the possibilities. Some nice moments, and it is an easy watch, but the 1st one is great after 11 years and multiple viewings. This is tiring about a quarter of the way in.",Final Destination 3
65,ctomvelu1,Tedious,4,7 September 2009,"FD 3 is one of those movies that, like Chinese food, you will have forgotten you even had within hours. A weak second sequel to FD, this time around a bunch of very generic youths narrowly escape death on a faulty roller-coaster, thanks to a premonition on the part of one of the group. TSon enough, they begin to get picked off one by one. Nothing new here, and the finale is something of a cheat. The roller-coaster accident at the opening is mostly CGI and not terribly convincing. The film's makers had to know it would be impossible to come up with anything as spectacular as the multiple car crash that opened FD2. This one's a little closer to the SAW series in terms of gore, for all you gorehounds out there. It includes death by nail gun to the head. But the movie is simply treading water, and quickly becomes boring.",Final Destination 3

Thought the first two were decent, we can't expect much from a third sequel since they usually suck. But this one is an exception; it beats the second. The actors in here all came from the underground American/Canadian cinema, and surprisingly, they act very naturally. If you told me they are all professional teenagers with lots of experiences in the mainstream, I wouldn't doubt you. The running away from death in this sequence seems to be easier than it was in the previous; two or three folks from the roller-coaster accident end up alive, which is a difference, since in the first, as far I as I remember, only one guy survived. Also, the deaths are painful to watch, specially the tanning machine's. See this film if you're interested in a teen horror movie with a good and pretty cast.",Final Destination 3

You probably know the drill by now: people are about to die, someone has a vision and saves them all, then they start dying anyway. The makers know their formula is losing a bit of steam, but they compensate that by making the death scenes as outrageous as possible. Death isn't just satisfied with killing people, he wants them all pulped and shredded. You could fit some of these victims in an envelope. Can't really blame him though, because this bunch is pretty unlikable, which is the only difference from the earlier movies. I don't watch horror for the intensive character studies, but these stereotypes are really pushing it. Especially the implausibly dumb cheerleader types really bring the atmosphere down, I know they're played for laughs but this series should only be watched for unintentional laughs. When the makers make it so clear that they're in on the joke, it's annoying. But hey, it doesn't matter that much, this movie is still very amusing.",Final Destination 3

It shouldn't be too hard to guess what your probably enjoyment level from watching this movie will be. It's just like Final Destination 2 (and therefore, the original Final Destination), but with different death scenarios and a hotter main character.Once again, a group of people who were spared a gruesome end in a disaster because of a person's sinister premonition (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) face Death's determined and elaborate attempts to take their lives and satisfy his original plans for their fates. The death scenes are once again suitably inventive and gruesome (you'll never look at tanning salons the same way), and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is really cute. Those are basically the only relevant issues. If you were a fan of the previous movies, it stands to reason that you'll also enjoy this one. If you hated the first two, the third installment won't change your mind. I'd say that this is my favorite of the bunch.

Course, I was 11 when I did & never got the chance to watch it. It was only until 2011 with Final Destination 5 being released I got the chance to watch this one. Wendy has a premonition that she & her friends will die in a roller-coaster derailment on The Devils Flight! Like the previous 2 films they cheat death & have death come after them, this time around the photos of each victim & how they'll die, similar to The Omen film in 1976. This is how they cheat Death... sort of. With the absence of Bludworth with only his voice used in the Devils Flight statue! Which was intimidating!It was a really good watch! Liked the roller-coaster as I'm a coaster enthusiast & liked the film as a whole! It was a decent watch with decent death scenes in it!The deaths were quite good in this one, the premonition of the roller-coaster was great & very sinister looking! The looks on their faces was priceless! Not to mention the deaths & how well they were executed (no pun intended).

This film (taking place five years after FD2) is about Wendy and some of her friends who get in a rollar coaster ride. The rollar coaster starts to malfunction because of the hydraulics rupturing. Things gets worst when Frankie, one of the students, drops a cam corder which makes the rollar coaster even more dangerous. Wheels start to fall off and sections begin to fall out the tracks. The rollar coaster crashes because of broken track and Wendy wakes up in a premonition. She gets out and drags 9 more people to get off. Then suddenly, the 10 survivors begin to die one by one in freak accidents.James Wong came back for this installment. David Ellis was the director who had bring the series up a notch. Now James Wong has to raise his own. It turns out that he didn't do it. This film was a let down. Ideas of deaths are running out.In fact, one let down was the premonition sequence where the rollar coaster crashes, which is the worst of the series. The whole thing looked okay. It was just not done well with its CGI. It lacked imagination and did not live up to the car accident sequence in the second one or not as good as the first one. The deaths were also a problem. Most of them were okay because it's like watching the same deaths over and over again.This film is very different from the first and second. They don't talk about how death works. I mean, why bother if you've seen the first two films? There are no parents involved. There is really no character development so that means we don't care who dies. And the movie plays out like a pattern: There is a death scene, then sad scene, death scene, then sad scene and so on...Although the gore factor is huge, that doesn't mean it's good. The acting was decent. This has basically the same plot as the first and second but I don't care. People go to see these movies for the deaths and I don't blame them. That's why I go and see these movies. Many people will be disappointed because the deaths were a let down. The acting by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman were okay.There are some comedy elements which were funny. What's different is that instead of seeing signs of how character dies, Wendy looks at the pictures she took before her friends rode on the rollar coaster, which is good and smart because it's different. Oh, a bad thing was that the characters are DUMB in this movie.Although this film did not live up to the second film, it was decent enough for me to recommend it, for its entertainment purposes. The acting and deaths were decent. If you just want to watch this movie for the deaths, you will be disappointed. If not, don't watch it because it's a let down.

The story isn't so fine written as in the first and the second one and I think that James Wong wanted just to bring another sequel, that's all. There aren't any new points or aha-effects because everything what I saw in this movie didn't surprise at all. This film is therefore much more violent and there are many bloody scenes. Okay, there are many plots and twists but I missed suspense. For all these reasons I won't keep the third part in my best of DVD collection because my rating with my wife is only 6/10 that matches exactly the current vote on IMDb. The end lets all open for part four but I think next time it will be completely a flop. Please remark the IMDb votes for FD 1 is actually 6.6 and from FD 2 6.3 and for FD 3 as I said 6.0.

This seems to be the scariest of the three, the very beginning, when Wendy and her pals are only going to go on a roller coaster, the whole horror is so palpable that you start to shudder with fear, and when all is done, and people are killed, you feel a complete freezing grip on you. Wendy is so scared that you feel this sticky, heavy horror on her, and all this wind, all this whispering terror encompass her... When all other people die, either in a solarium or in a car, in the park or in the gym, the Death is so terrible and so real, that the film never lets you feel bored. Suspense is great and you only wish Wendy were alive and OK. The most terrible scene - in the subway train - is so blood-chilling, that you never set your eyes away.

This turns out to be way better than i would have expected.I highly recommend you see the first 2 films as well, even if they aren't required viewing as far as understanding the plot goes.6/10 its the worst of the three, but only because it no longer has the freshness and originality, it is still just as much fun to watch.",Final Destination 3

Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Live free or Die Hard) stars as the girl trying to save everyone and cutie Ryan Merriman (Ring 2) stars as another potential victim going along for the ride. The movie is fun but it sadly skips the progress made with the second film feeling like more of a reboot.

77,Screen_Blitz,An improvement upon the second installment,7,19 April 2016,"The Final Destination franchise has experienced its ups and downs since its debut in early 2000 when James Wong worked in the director's chair. He made a solid impression with the first installment, bringing suspense and effective thrills of characters being picked off one by one. The sequel however, had David Ellis taking over the director's chair and what resulted was a less effective, but passable installment had some good moments but lacked the thrills that made the original a hit. This third installment see James Wong making his return as the director and showing significant improvement upon the previous entry, but also a signal that the franchise would wear out on creativity. The first film featured teenagers escaping a plane explosion, the second film featured a young woman escaping the massive highway pileup, this installment follows Wendy Christensen (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a high school senior spending a night at the state fair with her boyfriend Jason (played by Jesse Moss), her friend Carrie (played by Gina Holden) and her boyfriend Kevin (played by Ryan Phillippe). Upon stepping aboard a roller coaster, Wendy is shocked by a horrifying premonition of the roller coaster derailing and crashing, killing her and her friends along with the other passengers. In paranoia, Wendy steps off the roller coaster along with a few others, while some remain on board. Within moments as you might have guessed, the roller coaster crashes killing the remaining passengers. Months later, Wendy and the surviving passengers are left grieving and try to move on with their lives. Death however, still has their names on the agenda and comes back take the lives of the survivors one by one in a series of gruesome deaths.This film follows relatively the same formula as the previous two, with an opening disaster sequence, and the main characters' mission to save the lives of those who survived from dying in unexpected and gruesome accidents. Thus, the formula results in a storyline that is somewhat predictable but surprisingly still fun, especially for those who enjoy blood and gore because there is plenty of it here. Sadly, the film doesn't leave much room character development beyond portraying the characters in distinct stereotypes: a lustful pervert, a goth, an arrogant muscle head, two stuck-up school girls, you name it. Generally no characters here you come to care about other than Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the main character who offers some emotional resonance. There is some suspense around some of the characters' deaths while others leave the scares to the absurd amount of in-your-face blood and gore splatter. Now the film isn't exactly the straight out scare fest, the characters offer a fair amount of humor and clever dialogue, can't as he same for others though. The plot itself works for most of the time, but eventually runs its course towards the final act. The performances by the cast are fine, but none of which truly stand out from one another. Final Destination 3 is a solid installment to its average franchise and shows the franchise has some redeeming quality above its flawed writing and shallow character development. This film won't likely entertain those who are looking for a straight forward horror-fest filled with nightmarish imagery and jump scares. Otherwise, this film makes a fair source of entertaining gore-fest.",Final Destination 3
78,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,A Guilty Pleasure. And I say that Lightly.,4,14 October 2021,"Final Destination 3 is a sequel that exists solely for the purpose of BEING a sequel. The characters are all a$$holes you're relieved are killed in over-the-top ways throughout the movie's runtime. There's no real attraction here besides the gruesome deaths on display; and sadly the film's premise itself depends solely on the 'ooh look at that' factor that's been exhausted with all these 2000s horror sequels done in the spirit of EVERYTHING post-Saw.The 'horror' is not horrific at all, the deaths are like live-action Looney Tunes scenarios done for real, and the characters, like I said before, are cardboard/cookie-cutter caricatures we've seen a bajillion times before in better movies and the music is purpose-fulfilling only (it doesn't work outside the film really).It'd be nice if there was more self-awareness with these movies instead of cliches without the meta-commentary. These movies need to be more meta or something; because these scenarios have been done to death.",Final Destination 3
79,xredgarnetx,A worthy if slightly less imaginative second sequel,7,20 July 2006,"Here's something you don't see everyday: the original director (Wong) and writer (Morgan) are back for the third and presumably final installment in this low-budget, teen-oriented splatter series, and they acquit themselves quite nicely. The movie starts off with a colorful premise: a bunch of high school seniors are about to ride on a roller coaster when one of the gals has a vision of the coaster crashing and killing everyone on board. She manages to convince several of her friends to get off the ride, it then indeed crashes, and the rest of the movie is spent like the first two movies with death stalking the survivors and picking them off one by one in various grisly ways. The deaths in FD3 are not as imaginative or flamboyant or downright grotesque as in FD2 (remember the kid and the falling window?), and I suspect Wong and Gordon must have decided early on they couldn't possibly top FD2's killings. So the deaths here are more perfunctory and frequently over with in the blink of an eye. They are fun, nevertheless, and Wong and Gordon do manage to top the finales of both FD and FD 2 with an intricately plotted scene aboard a subway that you must see for yourself. The actors are largely unknowns, which has pretty much been the case with the two previous films and a longstanding tradition in most splatter series, and are no better or worse than their predecessors. Most are clearly too old to be high school students, but this is another time-honored movie tradition. The gal playing the visionary this time around, Mary Winsted, is suitably morose and gloomy. See FD3 in a darkened room with the sound cranked way up, and rest assured that you need not have seen either of the first two flicks to understand FD3.

81,antoniotierno,gruesome but not enjoyable at all,5,28 March 2006,"Having seen the first two installments I knew what I was getting into and could expect this formula, very original at first, would be predictable and old-fashioned. There are many thrill rides, direction is certainly inventive and the screenplay doesn't lack suspense or funny situations, nevertheless what you feel whilst watching this flick is a sense of silliness haunting the whole plot. Everything is strongly predictable and seems pointless, also the using 9/11 to cover the holes of its story line. I would save a dark sense of humor and an attractive cast but hope to never see a forth ""Final Destination"", it would be too much.",Final Destination 3

The most iconic scene was definitely the girls in the tanning bed. Then the celebrations of the tricentennial of the town with fireworks was tense with the horse going mad and the rebellious guy going insane. The last scene they all got together unknowingly on the metro. And those who cheated death died in the uncoupled car.,Final Destination 3

It is bit worse than previous sequels, for example this sequels is more boring and ignorant. Less funny. And less details. Everything somehow done in a rush than this even more looks like collection of small videos and jokes rather than a real movie.

Most of the actors are irritatingly too old for their parts, and none of them, including the leads, exhibit much verisimilitude, which is to say, they don't behave like real people might in similar circumstances. However, the film is not without merit. The opening sequence builds tension well, the cinematography is excellent, the editing is crisp and not overly-MTVish, and the special effects reasonably well done. Overall, a decent waste of ninety minutes if you're into mindless violence and seeing favorite ""types"" (airheaded Paris Hiltons, testosterone-laden jocks, pasty-faced goths, etc.) get waxed in painful ways. Those in search of poignant commentary on the human condition should look elsewhere.",Final Destination 3

By the time the money-men get serious about cashing-in on this franchise with the 3rd installment, it's mostly just an OK plot with some OK special effects and some OK acting and emotional involvement. ""Final Destination 3"" is not a bad movie, but by the time you've hit the third in this series , you've pretty much hit the definition of mediocrity, and you have an awful lot of other potential competition for your eyeballs at that point.",Final Destination 3

Let ME off, too!!!"" With the very first FINAL DESTINATION, the idea of featuring Death itself as the ""ultimate slasher killer"" was an outrageous but interesting conceit, and it was fun to see how writer/producer/directors Glen Morgan and James Wong pulled it off. Plus, the actors and the characters they played were a little more than just your usual cardboard-cutout special FX fodder, and that cast included the considerable presence of Tony Todd as The World's Creepiest Morgue Attendant, who was probably pretty close buds with The Grim Reaper, if he wasn't Death in human form. But now we're pretty much in the same territory as most horror franchises that manage to hit number 3. Mary E. is a good enough actress, and some of her co-stars are equally as good, but this isn't a movie where you feel very much for the characters at all. In fact, it's at this point where the audience starts feeling like a lot of people need to die, and in the most gruesome, spectacular fashion possible. FD3 brings that aspect big time. In fact, you know the effects department had a field day with this one.And just to absolve us of some guilt, the characters are even tailor-made to be the kind of people we don't mind seeing offed: an egotistical jock pumped so full of himself and probably two pounds of steroids, you'd think his head would explode at any second, (and if you're thinking there's a clue to his demise hidden in that statement, you're right); two trust fund brats/mall divas who actually make Paris and Nicole look like Rhodes scholars, (but turn out to be 'HOT' in a way that Paris would not like to experience); a Goth-guy who comes off as ""Christian Slater-lite"" from his career-making role in HEATHERS, and so on. Alas, Tony Todd's presence is made known in a couple of scenes only by disembodied voice-overs, which only hurts this sequel even more, serving as a reminder of what it was like when the series really did leave a trail of grape-sized goosebumps down the middle of your spine. So FD3 is really only good for the crowd who like things that go ""SPLAT!"" real good. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but a little character development and story would've been nice, too. But we already know that the third time is NOT the charm with most sequels, and FD3 does absolutely nothing to change things in that respect.",Final Destination 3
88,agmoldham,Like a Bond movie,5,25 February 2006,"The Final Destination movies have a formula in the same way as the Bond movies have a formula. For those people that haven't seen the first two movies, the formula is someone foresees a major accident and helps save a group of people that would otherwise have died. Feeling a bit cheated the grim reaper goes about gaining revenge with a series of grizzly deaths for those people that would otherwise have been killed in the accident.This time the accident in question is at a theme park on a roller coaster. The opening sequence could probably have been done a little better and the dramatic winding sound on the slow ascent of the roller coaster shouldn't have been interrupted with music - It's easily the best part of a roller coaster ride and builds tension automatically.The film doesn't pretend to be anything other than 90 minutes of fun and death.

The rest of the movie has the survivors trying to cope in their own way with what happened while the Grim Reaper like presence is hot on their tail and ready to finish the job. A highly entertaining splatter-fest ensues.James Wong, the director of the original, is back on board and he has a gruesomely impressive array of tools (no pun intended) to carry the movie from scene to scene with nice ebbs and flows of tension. That is really the high point of the film, the gore is there and it is good, but the build up to each death is really well done and only adds to each little bloody climax. Fans of the first two movies will have plenty to love here: the deaths are inventive, the timing sometimes catches you off guard, and the gore of first rate. Heads getting shredded by fans to being squished along with classics like impalement - fun and tense stuff all the way through.However, if that sounds awfully heartless and callous to you, it means you didn't like the first two entries in this franchise and can calmly steer clear of this film.

90,mario_c,No one can deceive death!,7,2 February 2007,"This is the third movie of the Final Destination series and it's not bad at all to be a third sequel I've already seen the previous movies, but to be honest, I can't remember many things about them. I don't remember, for example if the ""chosen ones"", the persons who had the visions, died in the end of the movie All I can remember are the contexts and a few deaths.In this one, the context is pretty original and even funny, I might say! To transform a ""party camp"" in a ""cradle of death"" was ""interesting"" The plot is very close to the previous films, so what was really attractive in this movie was to watch some ""new kinds of death"", and some of them were inserted in contexts of real dark humor! The deaths of the blond girls, the guy who was always picking some ""nice photos"", and the guy at the gym, were really funny! I mean, their deaths are not funny by themselves, but the contexts which originated them were pretty absurd; they had so dark humor that they even seem taken from a spoof movie! On the other hand, the movie has a lot of gore scenes. Some of the bloody scenes are very well done and might impress some ""weak persons""! The guy who was sliced in half, at the beginning, the guy who died in the car crash (with his head totally ""open"") or the girl who died with her head full of steel nails are good examples! I enjoyed this film, especially because it was an amazing mix of fun and gore!",Final Destination 3

The acting is just atrocious. The CGI looks like it was done ten years ago and the deaths are just way too crazy and impossible.Just like always person has vision where her and all her friends die. She gets them out of the predicament and then death starts stalking them killing them off one by one.If you are a fan of the series don't watch this one. It will surely ruin it for you forever.

93,Superunknovvn,Inferior to its predecessors but still highly entertaining,7,21 April 2006,"""Final Destination 3"" doesn't offer anything new. Once again a group of teenagers is saved because one of their friends has got a hunch, once again death hunts the survivors down one by one in the aftermath of the accident. While in part one the story was still new and very thrilling as we learned what was going on, part two found a great way to tie in the story of the first one and even came up with a satisfying solution at the end. Another entry in the series really couldn't add anything new to the original premise. And it doesn't. And it doesn't really matter.This movie is essentially a remake of ""Final Destination 1"", only the filmmakers don't have a lot of explaining to do anymore. The survivors just find out about death's evil plan via the internet (...) and off we go to another 90 minutes of gory and surprising deaths. Sure, it's annoying that the characters are as flat and clichéd as can be and that the few moments of drama in between are the most boring thing you saw on screen in a long time. The death scenes, however, make up for a lot.Although a disaster involving a roller-coaster sounds like a great idea, it actually makes for the worst opening sequence in any ""Final Desination"" movie so far. It's not awful or anything, but the premonitions and the accident itself could have been done way better. Look to part 2 for a moody, direful opening. Thankfully ""Final Destination 3"" gets better later on. What makes these movies so suspenseful is that we always know a character is going to die soon, but are not sure how. When the bubble finally bursts and we see someone die a ridiculously gruesome death, it's just entertainment in its purest form. Call me brainless and undemanding, but to me this formula still works.Still, it is pretty disappointing that FD-creator James Wong took so much time for this sequel, but wasn't able to come up with anything remotely fresh in the end. The movie doesn't even have a real ending. So, if you're looking for a sequel as in ""continuation of the story"", look elsewhere. If you'd like to watch the first movie with different actors and deaths over again, don't hesitate to see ""Final Destination 3"".",Final Destination 3
94,acidburn-10,Great start but quickly turned predictable,6,9 July 2012,"I absolutely loved the first two movies in this franchise, and when I heard that they were making a third, I was a bit sceptical at first because obviously that what started out as an original idea, is just being milked for box office returns, but anyway I still wanted to see it, just to see what horrible gruesome deaths that would be waiting in store.The plot the same as always, only this time a completely new cast and this time featuring a roller-coaster accident gone wrong, which I loved and kept me thrilled and on the edge of my seat for the entire ride. But one of the main flaws of this one is the characters, I just couldn't take to any of them and they were poorly developed and strictly one dimensional, something that often happens when they turn films into franchises and this one's no different unfortunately. Apart from the odd one or two decent cast members, the cast were mainly forgettable and nothing like the relatable characters or cast the first two movies had.The movie as whole just seemed a bit lazy at times as well, and nothing new was added to the mix this time, but this movie was entertaining though and saved by the cool death scenes that generated suspense and thrills, but by the end just seemed a bit generic and shallow. This movie started off well but then geared away into something straightforward and by the numbers and predictable.Mary Elizabeth Winstead was definitely the most capable cast member of the lot, she was credible in her emotional scenes without going over the top, so glad that she has gone on to bigger and better roles. Ryan Merriman was the only male cast member that was convincing and memorable. Texas Battle was simply one the cardboard characters with no layers to his performance and Kris Lemche was typecast playing the exact same character he played in My Little Eye, but he did an okay job.All in all fast paced loud and exciting, but predictable and generic at the same time and the first downfall in a promising series.",Final Destination 3
95,DonFishies,"Very campy, very violent, but only slightly fun",4,30 September 2006,"With Final Destination 3, we come to the inevitable possibility that the studios will either end the franchise at three films, or push it into being a long-running series of films (undeniably what will happen to the Saw franchise), progressively getting worse and worse. I can only hope that they leave it where it is. It is not that this movie is really awful or anything, but camp value can only go so far.Everyone from the first two films have bitten the dust or ""vanished into obscurity"" (hope I am not spoiling those two films for anyone), so we get a new set of characters, all graduating high-schoolers. In what starts off as a fun grad class trip to a local fair, turns out deadly when Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a horrific premonition before getting onto a roller coaster with many members of the class. She and a few others get off the coaster, but unfortunately, as the roller coaster begins to move, her premonition proves correct. Slowly and calculatingly, death begins to knock off every member of the group who managed to get off the coaster, and it is up to Wendy and her friend Kevin (Ryan Merriman), to stop it all.For a movie like this to totally work, it needs some sort of amount of seriousness. But there is none to be found here. People die carelessly and violently throughout, and none of the characters really seem to take the time out to care. The movie opens right up, and just keeps speeding on, with no thought to slow down and have some sort of pathos to be felt by the audience. Instead, they just seem to want to cram in just enough inventive death sequences that they can, and not have any thought of making the film feasibly sound. While none of the characters really are likable or memorable at all (although they do follow every high-school stereotype known in existence), some of the makeup and special effects are really great. Every death, no matter how silly, does look violently impressive. Blood splatters the screen practically every ten minutes, and just when you think there has been enough, more comes at you. It just does not let up at all. The obvious focus was on the death sequences, and it is obvious in how careful and meticulously precise they play out. The most memorable of all of them is the opening roller coaster sequence premonition. Although marred by some pretty atrocious CGI effects, is impressive to say the least.But what I found to be the most effective and unique thing about this movie, and possibly the only reason it is even remotely going to be remembered at all, is the ""Choose their Fate"" option available on the DVD. The viewer is given the option as to what should happen to these characters, and effectively change the entire course of the film. It is something that I have never seen done before, and I enjoyed playing around with the options as I watched the film. Of course, the uniqueness wears off after a bit of time, but it is undoubtedly something that may become more widely used as time goes on. And it definitely beats having to watch the same crappy horror movie that has been done multiple times before.I guess what it comes down to for a film like this is this:Do you want likable characters? Do you care if the plot makes any sense? Do you get enjoyment from watching stupid teenagers get slaughtered in the most unsound and potentially inventive ways possible? Do you watch horror movies, and think that the ante should be amped up more than it ever is?If you even remotely say yes to any of those questions, than you may find some enjoyment from Final Destination 3. Tongue is firmly placed in cheek throughout the entire course of the film, and it never budges. Be prepared for a ton of violence, and anything stereotypical that you can even slightly think of. And if you can, do check out the DVD for ""Choose their Fate"", it really makes for the film to be much more watchable.4/10.",Final Destination 3
96,innocuous,A big step down from FD2.,4,11 August 2006,"This is certainly the poorest of the series. FD2 wasn't great or original, but the vehicle crash sequence at the beginning of the film was outstanding. As with all the FD movies, the initial sequence kicks off the whole plot, as well as introducing the characters.The initial (roller coaster) sequence in FD3 is just lame. It is 75% CGI and totally unbelievable. The quality of the CGI is barely up to video game standards. (And this continues to p*ss me off. I wonder if it is that gamers simply accept the poor quality of graphics that are common to video games and assume that movies ought to have CGI FX of about the same quality. If I were a director and I couldn't do any better with CGI, I simply wouldn't use it. Again, check out the first 20 minutes of FD2 to see what I mean.)The rest of the movie makes up for it a bit, but you really shouldn't judge the previous two movies in the series by this latest effort.",Final Destination 3

98,LoneWolfAndCub,A step-down from Final Destination 2,7,30 April 2006,"Final Destination 3, despite being mindless entertaining with some creative deaths, is disappointingly basic and a little lifeless. This follows the pattern the first two did. Someone has a premonition of an accident that involves a group of people meeting grisly demises. This time Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), envisions a roller-coaster accident in which it de-rails causing a group of high school students to meet their maker. Wendy goes ape, causing a number of the students to leave, and naturally the roller-coaster crashes killing everyone else on it. Then the strange accidents start occurring as Death gets a little annoyed his plan has been screwed with. This movie is passable if only for the deaths, which are very creative and quite nasty, gore-hounds will be satisfied. However, the acting is average (but passable for this type of movie) and the script could have been a little better, as most of the characters were completely wooden and dialogue overly corny.

And it's (what Roger Ebert titles ""Dead Teen Movies"") formulaic. But it's a lot of fun watching a small spin on a tired genre.What I liked most, is the seriousness of how they approach the material. They clearly know their audience, as well as their thriller movie types. Not one of them is original. Nor should it be. You don't go to McDonald's expecting to eat lobster. For what they were able to accomplish, the gruesome deaths, the shock gore...it wins over the skeptical.If you stop to think about your time being your time to go, and if you cheat it, death gets peeved, it's a great concept. However, it'd be nice to know the people who have visions, where these come from, because there's obviously a contingent that wishes them a brighter future.",Final Destination 3

With death waiting around the corner, Wendy and Kevin Fischer must try and work out death's plan, before they and the remaining survivors end up dead.Death is back again with new trick for the unfortunate teens, but can James Wong pull off another hit. The second film was great fun, but was not even nearly as good as the first film. Unfortunately, this problem affects the third movie as well. It just didn't feel as fun as it was watching the previous two instalment's. There is nothing wrong with the stars or the effects, the blame is put more on the fact that the film doesn't really give us anything new. We basically know what's going to happen and just wait for the deaths.

103,baileycrawly,"Third Time's a ""Charm""",3,1 July 2020,"James Wong returns to the franchise to direct the exact same film he directed back in 2000!You know, the second sequel could be forgiven its similarities because, as an optimistic film fan, you always want to think that it's a stepping stone to something better. But it's not.Perhaps it's a gullible fanbase or a willingly ignorant devotion that draws people to these films time and time again, but each film is a rehash of the other, and only serves to drag the entire franchise down. It's a copy and paste of the films that came before it, with the setting and a few minor events changed. These sequels are the Home Alone 2 of the horror world (although Home Alone 2, in its own unexplainable way, worked and managed to be interesting enough to watch all the way through).These filmmakers must think the viewers are too stupid to realize that water and electricity or technology aren't a good match, because they insist on doing the same setup for a kill in every single film. Aside from one (tanning bed), even the kills in this movie aren't entertaining, shocking or memorable in the slightest.This film had a promising opening, and it would've worked better if the writer pulled a reverse Hellraiser, wrote the increasingly ridiculous ""Final Fantasy"" plot out of it, and just went for an amusement park horror story.Honestly, if Death was coming at me with the exact same trick time and time again, I'd let it take me instead of sitting through something like this.It's an unspoken rule with horror sequels that somewhere along the way they'll unintentionally do something that's actually interesting, noteworthy or even create a moment that will go down as a horror movie classic moment. This franchise has done none of that. If anything, these sequels are making me re-think how highly I rated the first one. Everything since it has tarnished the first one and made it less and less desirable in my mind.The first Final Destination should've been THE Final Destination.",Final Destination 3
104,nitzanhavoc,"Better than the 2nd, not as good as the first, but fun to watch nonetheless.",6,19 June 2016,"I must say that after a rather wanting sequel, I've had very lowered expectations from Final Destination 3. Luckily, this have turned out to be in my favour, as this film has impressed me more than I could anticipate and has spared me unnecessary disappointments.The main gist of the story remains the same, the premonitions of foreboding doom made famous and turned into a franchise. This time, it's a roller-coaster accident. Again, the survivors start dying, and must learn to read the signs and recognize death's design in order to intervene and save each other. Seeing as how director James Wong (who's done a much better job here than in the first film) had obviously had no intentions of offering anything innovative or new, and had just meant to capitalize on the already successful motives - the best way to look at FD3 is by comparison.The good: I find it difficult to connect to the whole damsel in distress routine when it's forced upon the main protagonist, but objectively speaking - it was called for. The first two films showed very brave young people in their late teens or early twenties, and being so brave and composed in the face of such tragedies and dreadful predicaments damages suspense of disbelief. This time, Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Wendy) is a much more realistic character, much more human in the face of death. Also, using pictures as signs and hints (while completely unoriginal in Horror) was a nice addition. And finally, the ending was the best one yet. Involving a few surprises and half- twists, and not at all comical like in the first film (altogether, there is nothing comical about this film, no comic relief or anything of the sort. Good to see Wong has learnt from his past mistakes!). Before I forget - Candyman Tony Todd doesn't appear in this one, but his voice does!The bad: first of all, the famous nude cheat. Come on. Was it really necessary to degrade the film and audience by throwing in two naked girls? Not to mention degrading the actresses (Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe, who've performed beautifully delivering a very convincing and authentic duo of shallow bimbos - yes, it takes some skills playing the part right). Second, the unnecessary addition of viciousness felt forced and redundant. There was no need to add a vindictive side to Death, having it simply doing its jobs and killing those whose time had come was more than enough.All in all, I still don't think the film had the same impact as the first, and I did miss the sense of continuity which appeared in the 2nd film, but if you're a fan of the franchise - you'll definitely enjoy this one.",Final Destination 3

I personally like horror movies but it's very hard to find good ones. To be a good movie, in my opinion, it has to be realistic and scary (something that can actually happened to you) but most of them are trashy, stupid and with tons of gore (I hate that, don't know why people like it). This is an ok movie, if you watch it with friends and don't take it seriously it can be kinda fun. Well, at least it's not the worst.

Teens avoid death by at least one of them getting a vision of the near future carnage and convince close friends to leave the area before the accident that takes many lives. None of the characters are related to the characters from the original two movies, but one of the teens knows about the story of the original two movies and makes the connection. The storyline is new, takes place at a carnival, but the dialog and screenplay are the same old stuff. Some tricky new deaths and a little less audience sees it coming while the characters are oblivious to their surroundings. The acting seems a little overdone in an effort to create suspense and terror, but overall it was OK. Attempts were made to use unique camera angles with little success.",Final Destination 3

But Death is still going to get his, and Wendy and her classmate Kevin (Ryan Merriman) must race against time to save those who got off the roller-coaster, before they die by other means.After two exciting films, I was expecting the same thrill ride for Final Destination 3. It wasn't as good as the first two but it was still a worthy addition to the franchise. It offered enough thrills and creative kills but it was lacking something the first two had. The first two had a fun factor and they didn't take themselves seriously. Final Destination 3 didn't really have that fun factor and the same tone was kept throughout the film. I still liked the movie but my experience wasn't as memorable as I was hoping it to be.The best thing about the film were the death scenes. James Wong and Glen Morgan should be given credit for their imagination since they came up with some effective kills. Besides for the death scenes, everything else was just average. The direction was pretty similar to the first two but there was still plenty of suspense. The script had a few plot holes and it wasn't entirely convincing either. The special effects weren't very convincing either. The roller coaster accident looked so fake and it was hard to suspend belief. The characters weren't that smart but this was expected. Also, some of the dialog and scenes were kind of cheesy and lame. Again, this was expected.Unsurprisingly, the acting was horrible. I can usually ignore bad performances in horror films since that's not supposed to be their strongest point. However, the performances in this one were a lot worse than the performances in the first two. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was very pale as Wendy and she didn't really seem to be trying. Ryan Merriman was just very unconvincing. Kris Lemche gave the best performance but that's not really saying much. The rest of the actors couldn't really break out from their one dimensional characters and they aren't worth mentioning. In the end, Final Destination 3 isn't as good as the first two but it's still worth checking out. Rating 6/10",Final Destination 3
108,kdnor2011,A nice gory movie,9,29 March 2010,"After all the complaining I did about FD 2 you would probably expect me to dislike this movie as well. Nope, not only do I love this movie, but it is my favorite film in the franchise. Now that doesn't mean it's the best, just my personal favorite. This is the film that taught me that maybe just going by a review isn't a good thing. I saw the Bad Movie Beatdown of this film on thatguywiththeglasses, thought it looked stupid, watched it, and really liked it. So thank you Matthew, thank you for introducing me to this franchise.OK, now this movie is pretty stupid, it definitely tries a little too hard to be dark when it really is more of a horror comedy. The forshadowing can be annoying at times. Really only the two leads are likable, and at times it doesn't make sense.However, the reason this movie is my favorite might just be personal. I HATE roller coasters, they are death traps. You have a good chance of surviving a plane crash, and I'm not afraid of cars in the slightest, unless maybe I'm driving. But rollercoasters freak me out because you are basically trapped there and can't move at all if something goes wrong. I really like the two leads, they are very likable, and of course, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great and very pretty. I love the death scenes, they are so over the top that I don't even care if they make sense. The effects are great, they use a lot of practical effects for all you CGI haters. And despite the forshadowing being forced, I really enjoy it.Is FD3 technically the best in the series? No. But it's my favorite mostly for a personal fear of roller coasters. So if you don't like it that's fine, but at least give it a chance.",Final Destination 3

Wendy is taking pictures for the high school year book with her boyfriend Jason and friends Kevin and Carrie. Deciding to end the night, they take a final ride on the roller-coaster. Before it takes off, Wendy has a premonition of the tracks breaking and the coaster crashing; killing all. Freaked, Wendy is removed with Kevin and other class mates; Jason and Carrie stay on; with the coaster crashing. A few weeks later, Wendy still hasn't moved on, yet notices strange omens in the photos she had taken at the fair. Soon one by one all the people from the coaster start dying in strange accidents.If your familiar with the Final Destination films, the premise is simple and straight forward. The premise has always been an interesting one; people cheating death, then death coming back the reclaim what's rightly his, though the story and overall package is thin; being stretched even further in this third installment. Just like it's two predecessor, Final Destination 3 isn't that great a film. The acting is bad, corny and bland dialog, nor is the directing. But these are superfluous elements for a franchise that built itself on high elaborate death scenes; showing bigger and stranger ways for people to die. The roller-coaster crash sequence is the high and most thrilling point of the film; yet doesn't compare to the crash sequence from Final Destination 2.Director of the first Final Destination James Wong, returns to the director seat for the third installment. Also writing the script with Glen Morgan, Wong returns to his original formula of the first film; instead of building from the second film which changed things around. Not building upon the formula makes the story predictable and easy to work out; leaving you just waiting for the next death to occur.While no great piece of film making, Final Destination 3 is just as entertaining as the first two.",Final Destination 3

The second one was good but didn't compare, but I think the third is the worst. Let's face it people, every single one of these films has the exact same story. The only difference is the initial accident and the deaths. There's only so much you can do.The acting is pretty bad but what you'd expect from any teen horror film. Former Disney Channel star, Ryan Merriman, proves that he really has no depth as an actor. As I said, the story is nothing new whatsoever. I almost can't believe that they're making a fourth film.

Director James Wong (Final Destination) is back after a hiatus for film two, bound and determined to top the success of the original film. And he has succeeded beyond all expectations as this film has broken all box office records for this type of film. This time a faulty roller coaster is the scene of initial mayhem as the boyfriend of the main heroine dies aniline with the girlfriend of the boy that ends up with her on the coaster ride from hell. The cast contains the usual group of people from the ditsy valley girl types to the goth girl, skeptic know it all, and the truly ass of a football jock, whom you end up not minding getting theirs. Where James WOng succeeds is that every time you think you have figured out how they are going to get it, something totally different happens.

After some amazing previews, but mediocre reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. What I got was one of the most chilling movies I've ever seen with a great plot and disturbing deaths. It really built up suspense and didn't rely on cheap scares. Originality was surprisingly present as well, with a great story, interesting characters, a camera element, and excellent beginning and ending sequences. I have to admit the introduction of characters was lame and the acting was bad at first, but everything got much better very quickly. After the film ended, I couldn't believe how good it was - the best of the FINAL DESTINATION films.

114,Quicksand,Kills Teenagers Dead,9,18 February 2006,"It's been a week now since I've seen this one, and the more I think about it-- the stuff I liked, I REALLY liked, and the stuff I hated, I REALLY hated.What works: the script. It's not Shakespeare by any means, but at least it takes the time to set up characters and relationships so that when the deaths begin, you care about these people. ""I'm going to break up with him,"" says one character minutes before her death. Later in the film, the 'him' tells someone, ""I was going to ask her to marry me."" In the typical dumb-horror sequel, this kind of intricate character moment is unneeded and ignored. Here, writers James Wong and Glen Morgan take pride in creating real people (at least on the page) for their script, albeit one that kills people frequently and viciously.The first film was a suspense movie, the second was an illogical straight-to-video style dumb sequel that cared more about killing than acting or dialogue. The third film leans more toward the first, thanks to better filmmakers, and though it doesn't surpass it, it comes a lot closer than it should.According to the trivia, actors were cast 3-6 weeks before filming, and it shows. The first film had up-and-coming stars (at the time, anyway), and the second had very good actors saying incredibly silly things. Part Three features Ryan Merriman (the poor man's Shia LeBeouf) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (the poor woman's Jennifer Love Hewitt). Their characters are given specific, actual motivations to play (he lost everything important to him except his best friend's girlfriend, whom he feels protective of; she is a bookish control freak), and the actors either make no attempt to play to this, or are incapable of it, or the director couldn't be bothered.It may be a combination, as I re-watched the first one and remembered how all the actors in that one were good, but under-directed. Despite this, there were some memorable images, a tight script, and a movie that followed its own logic. Part Three doesn't integrate the second film like I thought they could have, but the more I think about the ending, the more wrapped-up it really feels, in a way to make both the thoughtful fans, and the gore-hounds, happy. And the roller coaster sequence was *bleeping* intense.Still though, a better cast would have been a vast improvement. The actual Shia LeBeouf would have worked great as a protective popular kid, and Hewitt would have been just as perfect as the nervous outcast who no one likes anyway. Still, as being talking scenery in a better script than they deserve, everyone does alright. The death scenes are all appropriately shocking and graphic, the plot isn't contrived (other than the death-vision that again appears for no reason), and though the face of Tony Todd isn't in the film, you can still feel him. Now that's scary.Interesting Side Note: First Film, no breasts, Second Film, two, Third Film, four. It's like a math equation.",Final Destination 3

The crash does happen, and Wendy goes into shock.Flashforward a few weeks later, while tanning for looking their best at Graduation, Ashley and Ashlyn end up burned alive in their tanning beds (while the house is rocking to 'Love Roller-coaster'), and simultaneously, while looking at the photos she took that fateful night for the School Yearbook, Wendy finds out that some pictures look... weird.And while some accidents begin to claim the lives of the remaining survivors (including cherry-pickers, nail guns, weights, drive-thrus and flag-poles) Wendy finds out that the pictures (both of those who got off the coaster and of those who didn't) have clues in them to how the pictured person will die.Wendy and Kevin understand that Death wants them back, and try to fight it, but will they ever win? Or will they succumb to a grim fate? This is the 3rd in an amazing series, and outshines by far the confused and overall unsatisfying 2nd episode, getting near the raw grittiness of the original, with some spectacularly gory deaths (don't watch the sunbed scene if you're weak of heart) and the usual plot.The only downside, to me, is the main female, who is just plain boring.

117,Mr Parker,"6 Million Ways to Die, Choose One",6,11 February 2006,"I'm going to cut to the chase as there isn't much that I can write about the film that you probably don't already know. I'll just write mini-reviews of the parts of the formula in individual paragraphs:THE OBLIGATORY PREMONITION SCENE: Initial disaster takes place on a roller coaster this time out. The suspense leading up to the scene is great but once it actually gets to the scene itself it's kind of a letdown. After the masterpiece of violent death that was the highway pileup scene in Final Destination 2, this one just misses the bar. It could've been amazing if you saw more carnage but almost every death happens off screen and there really isn't too much gore. Plus the effects are subpar during this sequence.CHARACTERS: This entry has the most boring characters of the trilogy and personally, I was just waiting for them to buy it. The two leads were okay in their roles and I sort of liked them but I honestly didn't care about any of the characters.SIGNS OF DEATH: This movie takes a page from ""The Omen"", with the death clues being hidden in photographs instead of wall shadows and the like. I liked this idea actually and it served to make the storyline a little more fresh.OBLIGATORY DEATH SCENES: While the beginning scene kind of sucked, this movie has the best death scenes of the entire trilogy. I don't know if anybody disagrees with me but this one just had people get it in really disturbing ways. Some of the deaths were kind of bland but a couple of them were worth the price of admission. It's hard to talk about this without giving anything away so I'll keep the details to a minimum but I can honestly guarantee that at least five of those deaths will leave you with your jaw hanging. One in particular with a nail gun was just sadistic. If they ever make another one, that will be the scene (for me anyway) that all future death scenes will be judged by. That scene alone was worth the admission and I haven't even told you about the other scenes. The make up effects also deserve mention, they were really well done.IN RETROSPECT: I liked the movie and I did appreciate that the filmmakers tried to do something fresh with the idea. There were even some cool references to the first two films that should keep you on the lookout, like a cameo from the ""Drink Responsibly"" truck from part two. The ending scene was kind of crazy also. But in reality, we all know that we don't go to see the Final Destination movies to see well developed characters or scenes of great emotion. We go to see people's lives end in horrible, imaginative ways and this movie delivers on that count. I was hoping that they would have topped the second one's beginning scene but no dice. At the very least, it's much better written than the second one, which in my opinion has the worst story line of the bunch. That Final Destination 3 has the worst beginning of the three films and the best individual deaths of the series is the best way I can sum it up. Last but not least, make sure to see the movie in a packed theater or with a lot of people as the death scenes are the kind that are guaranteed to make audiences go nuts.RATING: *** out of *****.",Final Destination 3

120,happyendingrocks,Best horror series ever?,8,17 June 2009,"Once you've made it through this third chapter of the Final Destination series and found it to be just as enjoyable as the first two, considering the FD films to be perhaps the most consistently good horror franchise ever isn't such a leap. Sequels usually indicate diminishing returns, and things dip a little bit at times during Part 3, but overall the movie is just as sharp, tense, and bloody fun as the two that preceded it.Now that there is a formula in place, the labyrinthine kill scenes aren't quite as surprising as those in the first two films, but it's not because the film-makers don't try. The complex series of mechanisms that trigger the instruments of demise in the film actually lend themselves to an interesting guessing game not present in previous FD outings. We know the kills are coming, but we don't know exactly how the box of nails that just fell off a shelf is going to add to the sequence until it does. Though the strict reliance on these mazes of death toys does get a bit repetitive by the end, each set-piece pays off in a big way, and this installment is certainly the goriest of the series. The death scenes in Part 3 largely rival anything we've seen before, and since the films are in a large part an excuse for some twisted and shocking kills, it's nice to see the film-makers didn't skimp on the special sauce.The set up with the roller coaster isn't quite as jaw-dropping as the plane and car crashes that launched Parts 1 and 2, respectively, but the catalyst for the death-stalking here is played out in a believable and still quite horrible way, which maintains the intense realism that has driven the franchise.What this sequel does add that we haven't seen in previous chapters is the rather interesting concept of the final photographs of each victim, each of which lends some clever clues to their eventual demises. Like guessing exactly how each piece of the death puzzle is going to contribute to the eventual kill, the photos are a fun gimmick that gets the viewer involved with the adventure as a participant rather than just an observer.Ditto with the ""Choose Their Fate"" feature on the DVD release of this film, which allows the viewer to select one of two options for the characters in several scenes. Despite the billing on the package, home selections don't drastically affect the outcome of the film (you get an alternate death scene in most cases, but the character's going to die no matter what you do). However, it's still an entertaining twist that lends itself well to multiple viewings.The film-makers here learned from the few missteps in Part 2, and instead of a retread of previous excursions, we're offered a whole new slate of characters. The script is also a lot more solid, and the characters don't spend nearly as much time spouting their philosophies about Death's agenda. This leaves more time to build the suspense during the increasingly elaborate kills, and keeps the movie thundering forward to its lean 85-minute conclusion.The idea of a character plotting to murder one of the survivors after them in the cycle to upset the flow of Death's design is a fascinating one, and its about time one of the franchise's players got around to thinking about it. This bit of derangement is wholly believable in the context of the story, and it adds an extra layer of tension atop the already-busy happenings.We've come to expect twist endings from this series, and the one cooked up for Part 3 is a doozy. The concept itself plays out masterfully, and the last little wink thrown in for the final frames ends the film on a massive high-note.We'll have to see what the upcoming The Final Destination (the fourth film) has in store, but the franchise has set an impressive track record to date. It will be a real shame if the forthcoming chapter doesn't measure up to what we've seen thus far, but even if it proves to be a let-down, finding 3 films that are essentially the same story and having each one turn out as stellar as Final Destination 1-3 have is nothing short of remarkable. No other series in the genre has maintained the intensity of this trilogy and integrated as many fresh twists on the formula as we've seen unveiled here, and no matter what comes next, horror fans should remain thankful for the three quality outings we've been given so far.",Final Destination 3

The starting is the same as always: a girl has a dejá-vu about the tragic end of its friends, and at the last moment saves them, so Death (always there, never seen) has to work a little to kill the people that should have died before. Now this happens in a theme park, and the signals to save the people are made in photos. As a new thing, now Death is a bit angry, and the killing, that before were a chain of coincidences, become a little bloody and gorish, Death show a very dark sense of humour in most of them (though this can be easily understood, as she is Death). the movie is quite entertaining, and achieves the objective of keep you nervous about what is going to happen, and how will die the next one. The directing is good and the atmosphere created can transmit correctly the darkness of the situation. On the other hand, the fact that this is the third film of the saga, and the fact that it has nothing new (it is more another chapter, rather than a new film) makes him a little repetitive, but not bad!!! To sum up, an original terror film (well, equal to the ones before, but original, anyway) ideal to enjoy you time during 2 delicious hours. not recommended for people with soft stomachs.",Final Destination 3
123,mattiasflgrtll6,Third time's the charm...,8,22 November 2015,"This is not such a bad movie. I'm not sure why it has such a low rating.Wendy, right before she gets on it, has a premonition about the roller-coaster malfunctioning and killing several people. She loses someone very close to her (not gonna spoil who) and is of course scarred by the events. But some photos she has taken indicates how the survivors of the ride might die and so with the help of her friend Kevin has to figure out how to save all of them and cheat death. But can she do it before it's too late?Compared to the previous two movies, there's not really all that much to learn about how to cheat death and also has a weaker plot. Despite this, I had a very fun time! The characters all have their own (albeit very one-dimensional in some cases) quirky personalities and the main protagonist was likable enough to follow. The acting is pretty solid all around, especially from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman. Heck, I don't even mind some of the bad acting since it's bad in a funny way. You know, like Nicolas Cage in some movies! The dialogue is also very witty, with many lines I love to quote.It's incredibly well-directed as well. I think David R. Ellis did a really good job directing the second installment, but this movie proves that bringing back James Wong was a wise decision. There are plenty of interesting camera angles and a great attention to detail. It gets really intense towards the end, and the ending is very memorable (both the original and the alternate). And the cinematography is once again beautiful.There is also a terrific bonus, which is probably the reason why I gave this movie an 8 (I'm not gonna lie, there still were some flaws) and that is the Choose Their Fate feature. When you switch it on, the narrative is occasionally stopped and two options show up on the screen. One option doesn't change anything and lets the movie go on as originally structured, the other... takes a different direction. Seeing as this was the first time I ever saw this movie, I had no idea which options were the special ones sometimes. And that made it even more exciting. Of course, I couldn't help myself from frequently going back trying out the other option too.Now, I do have a problem: looking back, it wasn't very scary. The first movie constantly made me shudder and the second had some moments of cold sweat too. The third, while intense at times, rarely made me go ""Oh my God!!!"" and make my shoulders jump. And also, it's getting pretty old with characters acting like dicks every time someone tries to warn them. I mean, would it really hurt just to... listen?If you like me are a fan of the Final Destination series, don't be frightened by people raving about how lousy it is. I'd much rather have another Destination movie than another Saw (Can they please just STOP???).",Final Destination 3
124,ScottDMenzel,"""Final Destination 3"" is a good sequel that goes back to its roots and helps you forget about the previous entry all together.",7,8 February 2006,"When I first saw the original Final Destination back in theaters in 2000, I remember loving the film. It was original, it was thrilling and all in all it seemed pretty realistic and made me scared of death. Then in 2002, the sequel came out which basically went overboard. The death scenes were so far fetched and overly dramatic and to top it off the acting was horrible. Part two basically turned the film into a comedy fest. I personally didn't find it funny but everyone in the theater when I saw the sequel was laughing like crazy because it was so over the top. When I saw the original in theaters, no one laughed and everyone was just shocked and stunned by what was happening on screen. So with that being said I had my doubts about the third installment. Would it be more like the first or more like the second and that's the question that was in my head as I went in to the theater tonight to see a special screening of ""Final Destination 3"".""Final Destination 3"" is about a girl named Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who on her senior trip is at an Amusement Park with her friends and boyfriend. As Wendy and her friends begin to board the roller coaster she begins to have doubts about wanting to ride. It isn't long before Wendy has a premonition that the coaster is going to crash. Scared by this she starts a big scene, screaming that the coaster is going to break. Wendy and several others get escorted off the ride and as soon as they do the roller coaster does in fact crash. But Wendy soon learns that she can't cheat death and neither can anyone else who got off that roller coaster. And now, death is coming back making sure that this time everyone who cheated death original goes to their final destination. Gruesome fun ensues When walking out of the screenings tonight, I was actually impressed with how the film turned out. At first the acting seemed to be bad and the characters were so stereotypical but after the first death scene the film got better. The opening scene like all the other films in this series is always the best part. It's always the most chilling and the most creative part. This film luckily follows suit of the first film and not of the sequel.Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a very good lead in the film. I personally think she is a good actress, I liked here and I liked her in Sky High. She was very believable and pulled off the role nicely. Everyone else did a decent job as well except for three people: Chelan Simmons (Ashley) and Crystal Lowe (Ashlynn) the two girls who played those brainless Barbie girls and Sam Easton (Frankie) who played the annoying perverted guy. They were so awful and oddly enough at least to me after they were out of the movie, it got better. If they ever get a chance to act again it's a real shame.The reason the 3rd film is probably more like the original is because the original director James Wong is back. Mr. Wong really knows how to capture the death sequences without going to over the top. This is where the second one really failed. Everything was so over the top that it made it laughable. Luckily here the death scenes were more suspenseful and didn't cause an overabundance of laugher throughout the theater. I don't know how people laugh at death anyway but hey I guess some do. But Mr. Wong was able to recapture a lot of the elements in the third installment that made the original so great. I really think he should stay on board as director when they make the fourth one.In the end, ""Final Destination 3"" is actually a fun ride (no pun intended). It brings back all the elements of the original that the sequel left out. As far as the death scenes go and opening scene I would honestly have to say this one ranks up there as number one. It also features the best ending of all the films in this series so far. However, the first film as far as substance goes is still the winner. But I had a good time watching this film and hope to catch it again hopefully in a less crowded theater. This is one of those films you would like to watch with only a few people in the theater so you can actually react on your own and not by how the others around you are reacting. Overall I would say this movie has made me hopefully that the future installment will be just as good as this one and I will definitely be purchasing the DVD. A job well done Mr. Wong.MovieManMenzel's Final Rating for ""Final Destination 3"" is a 7 out of 10. It's a fun and gruesome ride.",Final Destination 3
125,TheMovieMark,If you enjoyed the prevous two then you should dig this.,7,17 February 2006,"Poor Death. The guy can't seem to catch a break. He's got a job to do, and now for a third time he's being kept from doing it. What's worse is he's being foiled by a bunch of high school kids! That can't be good for the ego. Within that context you can't really blame the guy for trying to finish the job. Heck, if I were Death I'd totally relish taking some of these brats out. Particularly the guy who calls himself Frankie Cheeks. Sheesh, if that guy were any more annoying then his name would most likely be Chris Kattan.Anyway, this is a movie that's very easy to review. Did you like the first two entries in the ""Final Destination"" franchise? Do you like to watch irritating characters meet unseemly demises? If so then you'll love it. If not then save your money. I don't want to hear any complaining.Personally, I morbidly enjoyed it. The movie starts off with a cringe-inducing roller coaster disaster, one that will likely make you think twice about setting foot in an amusement park again, and it rarely slows down for a breather. The filmmakers set out to ensure that the viewer, like a child at Neverland Ranch, is never at ease, and that goal is accomplished as each scene leaves the viewer nervously anticipating who is going to die next.Yeah, yeah, Wendy and Kevin are desperately trying to save their peers from Death's cruel hand, but come on. We all know somebody's head is about to be turned into ground beef or somebody will be on the receiving end of a dismemberment soon. We wait ... wait ... wait ... and then BAM! Gory kill. I should probably feel guilty for laughing out loud at some of these fatalities, but since these are silly little characters that didn't die in real life I've decided not to let it weigh on my conscience.A new element to the franchise is that clues are being left as to how the characters will die. Using her nifty digital camera, Wendy was busy taking pictures for the yearbook on that fateful night. After the accident, she begins examining the pictures and realizes that she has taken at least one picture of each survivor. A little more studying reveals that she might be able to use the photos to help the characters escape Death. Is this a case of Death playing a sadistic game with Wendy and Kevin, or is there some sort of benevolent life force that's trying to help them save their friends? The filmmakers leave it up to the viewer to decide.This is a nice touch that keeps the viewer actively involved in the cinematic proceedings. It gives us the chance to try to interpret the clues and guess who might be Death's next victim and how they'll be violently killed. Perhaps that's not exactly an activity you want to participate in so keep it in mind before laying your money down.One thing that really gauges whether a movie connects with its target audience is the crowd's reaction, and I have to say that ""Final Destination 3"" got the loudest, most involved reaction I've witnessed in quite a while. While the deaths were being thrown at us fast and hard, the audience was oohing and ahhing with every single one. During one particularly brutal scene a girl behind me let out a high-pitched shriek so loud that I had to turn around and make sure Chris Tucker hadn't wandered into the theater.No one goes to see a ""Final Destination"" movie with the expectation of great acting and high brow art. They just want to be scared or freaked out. Love it or hate it, there's no denying that ""Final Destination 3"" at least forces you to have an opinion about it. It'll make you cringe, it'll make you turn your head in disgust, but at least it's original and creative enough to make you feel something other than absolute boredom like some other so-called horror movies out there COUGHwhenastrangercallsHACK.If just one person decides not to ride a roller coaster the next time they're at an amusement park then the filmmakers have done their job.",Final Destination 3
126,randyfromscream,Awesome sequel to a series I like,10,31 July 2017,"I remember watching this before the forth film came out. I'd thought it's the best Final Destination movie ever because the death scenes, roller coaster accident, and good soundtrack just like the two previous films. I'd have to admit the ending is a bit of a slap of a face like having another vision about a train being wreck I'd think it don't fit in that way even though it's a plot twist so yeah. I think it's better then the fifth film because the film is a bit water down but the death scenes in the film is good. I'd recommend it to people who like film like these.",Final Destination 3
127,Rathko,Italian Splatter vs. The Hollywood Mainstream,6,21 February 2006,"Mildly diverting, but offers nothing new or original. The performances and production values are universally bland, and the script offers nothing in the way of character development, drama, or logic. The whole thing is really just a thin excuse to showcase very violent, very messy deaths, which the CGI team execute with surprising detail and realism. If you've always wanted to see a young woman get her head riddled with nails in crisp close-up, or a guy's head get destroyed in a truck's spinning fan-blade, then this is the movie for you. The quality of the splatter makes the complete lack of scares all the more disappointing. The feeble attempts at story have all the dramatic power of a porno plot. Next time, don't waste my time and just cut to the money shots. That's all we're paying to see anyway.",Final Destination 3

The dialogue and script is still rotten and the story is exactly the same apart from the fact it's new people and new deaths but they are still inventive and there is still a certain amount of tension and suspense. The acting is okay as well but you don't really come to care much about the characters, not like in the first one.One thing I will say which is different and probably stopped me giving this just a four or under is the ending, which I thought was daring.

Here Wendy has that vision and this scares others who opt out of the roller coaster ride with her. They all escaped death, but are still marked (although they do not know it) for death unless Wendy can warn them in time. She has been told what happened on Flight 180 (FD 1) and takes it to heart. Well, wouldn't you? The formula is the same in all movies, but the interesting parts about each movie are the ways the people meet their deaths. Some are quite clever. The death stunts (for lack of a better term) are simply pure artistry in motion. Each stunt is like that ball bearing catalyst that falls from the top putting into unstoppable motion items that will hit, slam, slip, swing, cut, pierce, and cause imbalances of other items that will cause more of the same until the final stop.The acting by all is impressive noting that none of the actors are household names. I found the cinematography to be excellent especially when the roller coaster goes off the rails. Impressive. CGI? Possibly. The color photography is especially noticeable as well. Good job.Now, does the entity Death toy with them until the last moment or is this just a case of people being incredibly stupid and careless causing their own deaths? After viewing FD 1, 2 and 3, I honestly don't know although a good case can be made for the latter after seeing some of the dumbest things ever that people do that cause accidents and ultimately death. OK, I am leaning that way. Hey ""Death: Be Not Proud.""No language in here, but you get your share of T&A, and, it's not a hard and fast rule that only the hard core horror movies showcase them. Yes, there is some gore, but it comes and goes so quickly you really cannot focus on it.

The movie follows the tried and true formula of the series: the main character sees a vision of her death and those of others, and manages to avoid it; nudity; violent, graphic deaths that are preceded by a strange chain of events; and the futile attempt of the victims to prevent their deaths — no, this is not a spoiler as this is all part of the ""FD"" package. Fans come back to this series not to see if the characters die — we all know they will — but to see how they will die. ""FD"" movies will never win any award for storytelling; its goal is to provide fun, albeit slightly twisted entertainment on seeing characters die horribly.

135,rcavellero,Final Destination 3...Final my ###,5,10 February 2006,"FINAL MY ASS...a review for Final Destination 3There is no doubt in my mind that Final Destination 3 is a bad movie. It features the worst performances of the 3 and takes it's subject matter way to seriously. Unintentionally intended as a dark comedy series the second one had the smarts to have fun with the concept with a winking eye all the while. Add that to the fact that it also managed to take it in a slightly new direction. I wasn't as impressed with the first film as other people although it laid the ground work I felt it was nothing more than a slasher movie with no visible slasher. But the performances added some extra zest and the story was told well. Now with this entry brought to you from the makers of the original and featuring no returning cast members (too bad cause we liked them) we are given a carbon copy version of the first over exaggerated of course with some highlight death sequences. This time around it finds a highly emotional and over acting young woman who has a premonition about a roller coaster ride gone crazy. She of course gets off with a few classmates and they begin to die in brutal ways. And yes they are viciously grotesque this time around. although the opening scene is some what of a disappointment the deaths following it of one dimensional characters are increasingly disturbing and graphic. But thats all the film has to offer. The story is tired and not very involving and a bit confusing to be honest. The dialogue is poorly written and the performances range from humorous to bland. But like most people I found myself cheering at the death sequences. and I guess this type of film is just gory fun and should be taken that way. But i can't help but feel they intended something slightly more memorable for this entry because of all the strenuos and illogical conversations. At one time I had heard that this film was initially supposed to be in 3-D and I believe it more now than ever. 3-D movies aren't usually that great because they spend so much time focusing on the effects . There are a lot of things thrusted toward you at the screen that would have looked great in 3-d but look a bit flat and comical on regular transfer. Oh well I guess they just missed the mark... And as for the film being Final. Final my ass the way they have it going now with no continuation of the other films, it can just happen to new groups of people and go on forever. Hopefully the people that did the second one will return for the fourth which still remains to be the best of the series... and thats not saying a whole lot. **1/2 (out of five)10:53 AM - 0 Comments - 0 Kudos - Add C",Final Destination 3
136,spacemonkey_fg,Fun Gory Times. Not to original though,5,23 March 2006,"Title: Final Destination 3Director: James WongCast: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ryan Merryman, Kris Lemche, Amanda Crew, Texas BattleReview:I remember the first time I saw the original Final Destination. It was like a surge of electricity with its interesting premise and disrespect for the life span of its main characters. It was something new back then and I will admit I enjoyed it immensely. But here we are now in the third installment in what has now become a franchise for New Line cinema and I must say that its formula of character seeing a premonition of a horrible accident, character warning all his friends and some of the surviving said accident only to be hounded down by death for escaping is feeling kind of old by now. The story this time centers itself around an amusement park roller-coaster ride called ""The Devils Flight"". A bunch of teenagers from the local high school decide to go to the amusement park that day and ride the big bad roller-coaster. Of course one of them has a premonition of a horrible roller-coaster accident and if you've already seen parts one and two of this series well you already know exactly what's going to happen here. And there lies the biggest flaw in this movie. Its too repetitive too redundant. There are absolutely no surprises as far as the story or the plot goes. I don't know how the producers of this film just decided to make this movie without having some sort of guilt on their minds. It is step by step the exact same thing from previous films. The premonition, then the character goes nuts warning everyone, no one believes herand they all die. That's basically it. But it isn't all that bad because there is some fun to be had here. The only redeeming quality in this here film and the reason why I don't give it such a low rating is because as we have all come to learn by know, what really matters in these movies are the way the characters die. And they die in very creative and original ways. It seems that filmmakers focused all their creative energies in making cool deaths and that's it. I can almost hear the suits saying ""The rest of the plot can be the exact same thing the kids wont notice! Just as long as we give em cool deaths!"" And that's exactly what we get.Every death sequence is well elaborated. Starting with the big action sequence that takes place in the roller-coaster which I must say was pretty cool, action packed and exciting. I mean this movie really milked everyones fear of something going Also its fun as hell trying to figure out how death is going to get each of the characters. Maybe that knifemaybe they'll get electrocuted, maybeand eventually it ends up being what you least expect. So there's some fun to be had there as well. Of course there's a couple of things that never really make much sense to me, for example: Why the heck would death leave clues in pictures? That's the stupidest thing I have ever seen. Come on, exactly who leaves these picture clues and why do these kids suddenly figure out that this is the way to beat death? Please. But I went along with it since its just another stupid little movie, that obviously the writers didn't give a crap about. They didn't put any effort into it as far as the writing was concerned. So in conclusion, don't expect any originality as far as the story is concerned. Just enjoy the deaths and the big accidents and the tension that comes from trying to figure out how each of the characters is going to die. Turn your brain off and you should enjoy this movie just fine. Rating: 3 out of 5",Final Destination 3

138,boyinflares,The Franchise that keeps getting Stronger,8,22 July 2006,"The First ""Final Destination"" was quite good and had an interesting new premise for horror. ""Final Destination 2"" was a major improvement, right from the horrific opening scene on the highway, to the unusual cast which surprisingly for horror did not consist mostly of teens or young twenty-something year-olds. ""Final Destination 3"" however, returns to the teen cast and is equal, if not better to ""Final Destination 2"".For those who are not familiar with the ""Final Destination"" premise, basically what happens is that there is some sort of major disaster (a plane blowing up in #1, a highway accident in #2, and a roller-coaster disaster in #3) in which a lot of people die, however, in all cases, someone has had a premonition about the disaster and thus Death's plan is changed because that person, and several others whom they are somehow involved with, are saved from the accident. So, in ""Final Destination 3"" Death begins chasing the survivors of the roller coaster disaster which occurs at a theme park on a night where a high school graduation party is happening, and the survivors must try and work together to figure out the order in which they were supposed to die, and hopefully prevent their deaths a second time.The cast of ""Final Destination 3"" are terrific, particularly Mary Elizabeth Winstead who plays heroine Wendy, definitely one of the best horror-heroines of the past several years. It was she who had the premonition and caused herself and several others to get off the roller coaster, and must ally herself with Ryan Merriman's Kevin, someone she doesn't particularly like, to fight Death. Merriman does a great job too. Jesse Moss who plays Wendy's boyfriend, Jason and Gina Holden who plays Kevin's girlfriend Carrie are also both very good. Amanda Crew doesn't get enough screen time as Wendy's younger sister Julie, though in her few scenes she is outstanding.Alexz Johnson is great as the sarcastic Erin (and gets the most shocking death), Kris Lemche is good as McKinley, Texas Battle is okay as Lewis and Sam Easton is good, but highly annoying, as Frankie. However it is scene-stealing Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe who deserve extra credit for their performances as Ashley and Ashlyn respectively. Both girls are incredibly humorous, good looking and have a very interesting death scene - I should note though, that their death scene was done first, and with a dude, in ""Urban Legend 3: Bloody Mary"".Typical horror conventions are followed (little to no authority figures) and the film flows at a good steady pace, a great soundtrack, and terrific special effects. However, two very interesting points of note: firstly, unlike many horrors where you can pretty much guess who is going to die as soon as you are introduced to them, ""Final Destination 3"" shakes things up a little by not following that general ""rule"" (more horror films should also ignore this ""rule""). Secondly, a shocking ending. I was beyond surprised, and quite frankly a bit disappointed (not with the ending, I thought it was great and very interesting), but just because that was the ending.All in all, a fantastic story and terrific cast make for perhaps the best entry in the ""Final Destination"" franchise - but if there is a fourth, will it be able to live up to the success of this one?",Final Destination 3
139,EvLauster,"Death thy name is James Wong, the first horror film of 06 that doesn't fail to deliver the goods, grisly and gruesome deaths for the taking",7,11 February 2006,"*** Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ryan Merriman, Texas Battle, Jamie Isaac Conde, Sam Easton, Patrick Gallagher. Directed by James WongOnce and a while the third installment of a series fails to deliver anything based on it's first two films, especially if it's a horror film. Like Wes Craven's ""Scream 3"", but all and all the movie gives the audience what it wants to see, some hardcore teens getting their punishment from death. Although after seeing the first two films you would have to believe you knew the exact story line for the death following a few premonitions in the beginning but for a third installment the films does bring some originality in itself and the deaths all the same.Amusement park goer and high school teen Wendy (Winstead) and her friends go on the roller coaster in search of a high tense, edge of your seat ride and get more than they bargain for when the roller-coaster spins out of control. After escaping death a few amusement park patrons are left in the ideal hands of death. ""Final Destination 3"" shockingly does not skimp out on the gore, instead keeps them coming one after another and hardly leaves you begging for more. Thankfully James Wong is back to direct and co-write the hopefully last of the series as ""Final Destination 2"" was hardly as good as either. David R. Ellis was wise not to come back for this one. The first film of 2006 that does not lack the fun factor or the gore factor. My final rating 8/10",Final Destination 3
140,samseescinema,"gory, B-level fun",7,10 February 2006,"Final Destination 3 reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.comrating: 3 out of 4 Final Destination 3 is a claustrophobic, uncomfortable picture that tortures us with chunky, exploding gore and the kneading suspense that tiptoes up to it. But make no mistake, this is no multi-layered psychological horror. Final Destination 3 is a one trick pony and knows it. The film's even aware it's the third in an already tired franchise. But Director James Wong succeeds by grabbing hold of these limitations and squeezing them with a tightly gripped vice, milking them for all their worth.We open at an amusement park, on a group of four seniors poised for graduation. They prance about, acting stupid and like teenagers at an amusement park, the boys egging their girlfriends into line for the famed roller coaster. Moments before starting the ride, Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a vision of the ride malfunctioning and every passenger meeting a brutal, bloody, high-flying demise. Making a scene, she forces the ride attendee to let the entire back train car off, not able to free the rest of the passengers. Of course, the ride malfunctions and kills a volley of teens, including two of the original group of four. Having ""escaped death"", the Reaper is now after the lucky passengers of the back train car. Luckily, the digital snapshots Wendy clicked off before the ride are riddled with clues as to the upcoming deaths of her fellow escaped passengers. Now on a mission, Wendy and her friend Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman) set out to convince and save their fellow students from their speedily approaching deaths.Final Destination 3 was made for teenagers and, surely, will be primarily watched by them. The R-rating shows that James Wong has courage both in his film, and in the deviantly clever sneaking skills of his teenaged demographic. Rest assured, it'll be 90% adolescents sitting and screaming in that theatre, whether or not the ticket clerk is checking ID's.But Wong takes this obvious demographic one step further, with a sly, subversive twist to the scripting; all in order to scare the teenies a stomach-twist more. All the deaths of Final Destination 3 are principally set and involve the stereotypical locales of teenagers. The set-pieces include an amusement park, a tanning salon, a drive-thru restaurant, and a weight room. But the list goes on, and is complemented by the stereotypical high school students to inhabit and inevitably die within them.Luckily, Final Destination 3 spares us two mildly believable characters in Wendy and Kevin; acting as a refreshing oasis to the pigeonhole stereotypes the remaining characters inhabit. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman do fine in the roles, but they're inclusion is only obligatory. Final Destination 3 doesn't ask us to care about its characters, but instead, demands that we relish watching them die. Fortunately, the deaths are acrobatically creative sights to see.Each death warrants three reactions from the audience: a hiccup of shock, followed by nervous laughter and, finally, applause. Like the previous two films, Final Destination 3 inhales with its suspense, and exhales with the gory finishes. The build-up is maddening in its tension, reminding us that we're soon to be shocked and deliciously nauseated. It builds to such heights that we're tempted even to break loose and shout loudly at the screen, ""Just die already!"" This is due in part to the ingenious puzzling aspect of Wendy's photographs. We're made aware of each of the snapshot's elements, so when it's time for another victim to meet his/her end, we notice each clue with mounting, frustrating nerves.Final Destination 3 marks a pleasant start to February, and, hopefully, a pleasant end to the Final Destination franchise. Wong has redeemed his original film and, with any luck, will decide against following up on his hook-em-for-a-sequel ending. What he's created is gory, B-level fun.-www.samseescinema.com",Final Destination 3
141,dirtychild,This ride gives you diminishing returns,5,16 October 2006,"Final Destination 3 tells the story of a teenager who has a premonition of her own death on a roller-coaster who then saves herself and a few others - before realising that they have escaped ""Death's plans"" as one by one, the survivors are killed off in gory fashion in the same order they would have died on the roller-coaster.Although I was a bit of a fan of the original, FD3 is a bit of a case of diminishing returns on a very convoluted idea. If you think ""Death"" stalking you is a convoluted idea enough - it is even more convoluted that the characters seem to (amazingly) find out explicit details of what happened in the first two movies over the internet (eg: someone has a premonition of their own death on a flight to Paris - the plane blows up but all the survivors die in a gory fashion later on..., etc)! Talk about a massive leap in logic or reality - one that I just did not buy.The characters are the usual bunch of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Dawson Creek look-a-likes - so much so it is really hard to tell the difference between them.... even harder to care about their plight. The standard Final Destination ""shocks"" are fairly predictable - if somewhat off-putting rather than scary.Reading all the trivia on IMDb - it sort of seems like they made this movie so they could sell a gimmicky DVD with ""alternative deaths""... which is sort of a bit of a lame idea to make a movie in the first place.I just hope they stop making FD movies - they are giving the first one a bad name!",Final Destination 3

This one on the other hand is not. Like all of the others, it recycles the same premise from the first film, only this time it is on a roller coaster. Besides that, nothing else to the story is very original or interesting and they try to cover up that fact by having more gruesome deaths. That trick might work on some, but not me.Another big problem with this film is the characters. Whether you liked the other films or not, the characters were at least given some sort of personality so you would route for them and hope they stopped death coming after them before it got them all. In this film, the characters are portrayed as obnoxious or annoying or both. I was not routing for these characters to make it out, I was hoping that death was going to pick them off one by one. I was given nothing in these characters to make me care about them.Granted, the clues in the pictures and them having to figure out what the clue in the pictures is was a creative idea, but that is all the film really has going for it.If you are interested in seeing any of the ""Final Destination"" movies, do yourself a favor and skip this one.",Final Destination 3
144,ray-280,"Uninspiring, unoriginal, and poorly acted, yet compelling",8,5 March 2007,"This movie just mails it in, but when your mail carrier is the Final Destination franchise, you can get away with it.Perhaps the most creative horror franchise of modern times returns for a third installment, a virtual carbon-copy of the original and second films. The plot is well known by now, as ""death"" stalks a group of kids who were spared a previous demise due to a premonition by one of said kids that disrupts ""death's design."" ""Death"" then spends the rest of the film making things right, at least right from its point of view.The casting in this film is weaker than the first two. Without A.J. Cook and Ali Larter to carry this film, we're stuck with garden-variety teen hotties who more than exceed the eye-candy quotient. We get stereotypical teens behaving stereotypically, until they come of age in a matter of hours thanks to the grim reaper.I suppose I'll never tire of these films, and I suspect we'll see a Final Destination 27 many years from now, but perhaps it's time to have death push the envelope a bit, expand its agenda, or mix up its MO, which by now has become way too predictable. Even the fakeouts that precede the actual slaughters are easy to spot. Death is definitely caught in a bit of a rut for now, but there is plenty of time to fix this for Final Destination 4.Catch this one if you find it on cable and want yet another sample of this fine franchise.",Final Destination 3

146,cdelacroix1,Fatalism and Fatality and Lots of Fear,7,10 February 2006,"Just saw this today and I really liked it. It's very much in the spirit of the first two Final Destination movies, so if you liked them (I sure did) I'll bet you, like me, will like this one as well.The acting, plotting, cinematography, pacing ... all worked well to maintain the same kind of high anxiety as in the first two Final Destination movies.When I think about it, the anxiety and fear are of two kinds mixed together. One is a very common fear in scary movies: Fear of Death. And the other is a much more uncommon fear: Fear of Fate. That second one, mixed with the first, is what really gives these Final Destination movies a special flavor. This unending sense that Fate is Out to Get You ... and that there's really nothing you can do to stop it ... that's what really makes for the special Final Destination sense of Dread. The myriad intricate ways in which Death contrives to work out the Fatal Destiny of each doomed teen fits perfectly with the overall Fatalism of the movies. Especially in the 2nd two movies, we have inexorable Death weaving its way through so many, many threatening and menacing images ... we look around, and Death is everywhere; then nowhere; and then suddenly swoops down to take another prey.Death is a Juggernaut in this movie as in the first two: mechanism plays such an enormous role in so many fatal denouements in this movie as in the first two. And the ways in which the Death Juggernaut kills are uniformly nasty, and generally very bloody.I do have one objection regarding social ethics of this movie. Teen sensuality is embedded in this as in so many scary movies. I have no objection to this as such. But I think the custom has generally been to keep the on-screen age of the teens either at 18 or older or (at least) unidentified. In this movie, though, the two sexy airheads who wind up in the double funeral are clearly stated not to have reached their 18th birthdays. In this time of oversexualization of under-age, any depiction like this tends to promote a culture in which sexual attraction of adults for the under-aged is encouraged, which in turn surely makes actual abuse of the under-aged more acceptable. I know, I know, this is a movie about teens; but much older adults watch these movies and there's just no reason I can see to encourage sexualized viewing of under-aged girls in movies or elsewhere.OK, but that aside, I did really like this movie ... that whole Final Destination conceit is to me just a wonderfully cool, suspenseful, frightening, *dreadful* and very very fatal ... in so many ways.Oh one last thing. It's natural to compare. Which is best of the series? IMHO, the best of the Final Destination movies is the first; next best is the second. But this third one is well worth seeing if you liked the first two. Check it out.",Final Destination 3
147,das417,Good fun even if it is a 'teen' movie,8,11 February 2006,"I have to say that the Final Destination movies, even if they are teen type movies, are good enjoyable fun. Watching teens die in horrible and unexpected ways at the hand of 'death' has more humor in it then one might originally think. Final Destination 3 continues the tradition the other two laid down and perhaps even passes the two before it.The victims this time are a group of high school graduates celebrating their freedom and their entry into the 'real' world. Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is a self declared 'control freak' who can't seem to escape the feeling that when things don't happen her way, a sense of 'dread' overcomes her. Of course her boyfriend and friends attribute this to nothing more then paranoia and simple fear. So of course taking her on the largest roller coaster is exactly what she needs, right? However, 'death' soon intervenes and those on the roller coaster face the end of their lives.... With the exception of Wendy, several classmates including her best friend's boyfriend Kevin (Ryan Merriman) as well as her 'exact opposite' sister Julie (Amanda Crew)... Thanks to a vision that Wendy experiences. It is then that they discover the costs of what happens when you deny 'death' and its plans. And only a series of photos taken by Wendy are the only clues they have in terms of how 'death' may or may not come and claim them leading her and Ryan on a wild chase. To those familiar to Final Destination, the usual strange and even cruel death scenes take place. What I thought was interesting was the fact how gory some of these deaths were in Final Destination 3. I don't remember being that many bloody deaths in the first two, but the extra gore added more of scare, and even humor, affect.Final Destination 3 comes close to surpassing the first, and does surpass the the second. The fate shared by Wendy, Julie, and Ryan at the end, when they thought they had escaped death and its 'plans for them' simply added to the moral of the story. That is, when it is your time to go, there is nothing you can do about it.8 out of 10",Final Destination 3
148,JimD73,One hell of a guilty pleasure,7,9 August 2006,"You can't cheat death thrice! Well, technically, according to the outcome of the first movie, you can't cheat death once. Regardless, the first two movies still stand as excellent guilty pleasures, for the moviegoer who delights him or herself in the pain and death of others. That about sums up my perspective, and boy did those films deliver. Despite how much I enjoyed the first two, I was skeptical about FD3, just because it seemed that they had run out of creative deaths based on the trailer, and the roller coaster idea wouldn't amount to a great death sequence like the pile up in FD2. While my worries were proved true in some aspects, that doesn't stop FD3 from being a great way to spend a night and a good guilty pleasure.The basic plot of Final Destination 3 follows the exact pattern from the first two. A teenage (insert gender) is on his/her way to (insert presumably fun event) with his/her friends when he/she has a vision about the (insert method of transportation here) crashing, and gets his/her friends unwillingly off the (method). Afterwards, the (method) crashes in a brutally fun-to-watch way. A short while passes, and then the group of survivors begin to die in freak accidents in the order they would have died had they not escaped. Why? Because you can't cheat death. It worked in the first two, and it still works here, even if it is walking over old ground.This time around, the one with the vision is high school senior Wendy Christensen (Winstead), who manages to get a total of nine kids off as well as herself. They all manage to fit into some sort of dead teenager movie stereotype, with a pair of ditzy hot chicks, a sleazy jerkoff, a body-building token black guy, a sensitive jock and a couple of skeptical Goths. Well, they are supposedly Goth, even though if it weren't for the black nailpolish, they'd probably represent the average non-jock/cheerleader student better than any of the other kids. The other two passengers are supposedly secret, though their identities are never really in doubt.Unlike in the first two, absolutely no time is devoted to developing the characters in any way, instead having them settle for fitting into their stereotype and assuming the audience will identify with one or two of them. Not to say that this is the fault of the actors, mainly just the fact that the characters aren't given any backstory or serious moments like some of the characters were in the first and, to a much lesser extent, the second. The sole exception is Ian McKinley (Lemche), the skeptical Goth kid. This is likely mostly due to Lemche, as he is the only one whose character transcends the barrier between caricature and character, which usually means lots of ad-libbing. The rest of the actors do a passable job, but nothing that will add to their resume in any substantial way.As if you needed to be reminded, the reason you are seeing a Final Destination movie is not for the acting, which has never been exceptionally strong. It is for the death sequences, which are always a mix of intricacy and surprise.Before you can get to the individual death scenes, you get to see the vision, in which you can see how the events would have played out had they not gotten off the ride. While the first's was mainly just a few people falling out and a big explosion, the second film upped the ante enormously with an incredible pileup sequence. FD3 attempts to up the ante once more with a pleasantly gory roller-coaster ride, but it actually comes out much more comical than the gruesome sequence in the second. It seems almost too thought-out to be as brutally effective, reducing itself to the level of campiness. Still, it is a fun ride with plenty of gore that entertains, even if it doesn't thrill.What remains effective are the individual death sequences of the survivors. While nothing compares to the shock of the bus death from the first or the intricacy of the ladder impalement from the second, there are some notably fun death sequences to be seen. A sequence involving a pair of tanning beds is easily the most brutally painful the series has been, though that does go against the mantra of the series so far, which is to kill in the most surprising way possible. One awesomely complex death-by-nailgun is the best the movie has by far, though there are plenty of other great gore scenes to be found.However, most come across as much more comical than in the previous two films, with these kids seeming to always be in the most dangerous place possible whenever they are about to get whacked. Little hint: if you are ever in a horror movie, stay away from tanning salons, weight rooms, hardware stores, subways and firework shows. Like the previous films, the more intricate deaths are shown from Death's perspective, with all the pieces presented to you early, giving you ample opportunity to figure out fifty different ways to kill off the characters based on the setup. Whether campy or shocking, it is always fun to figure out and the gore is always a nice bonus.While FD3 isn't as smartly effective as the first or as brutally fun as the second, it does still hold true to what, in the end, every Final Destination movie aims to be: a guilty pleasure. It isn't there to make you think or care, it is just meant to be fun and gory. While this one edges on camp in a few too many instances, and therefore isn't as good as the predecessors, it still is great slasher fun. So strap yourself in and enjoy the ride, and hopefully FD4 won't be too far behind.",Final Destination 3
149,manicman84,abounds with awesome deaths,6,11 August 2006,"To be honest, I hadn't expected too much from ""Final Destination 3"" as the 2nd installment disappointed me. While the 1st part was refreshing and suspenseful, the following one was repetitive and went over the top. What about ""Final Destination 3""? It's a some kind of combination of two previous installments. In the film seriousness coexists with comedy, while the latter is more frequent than the first. Comedy, most of all, stems from characters with very low IQ. One of them shouts with superiority something like ""death will never defeat me"" and then dies in most ridiculous way. Thus, the film is intentionally laughable at times. What's more, the flick abounds with awesome deaths and these quality gore scenes are probably the biggest virtues of this horror movie. Besides, the script is rather superficial and repetitive. I only liked an idea of photos depicting how victims will die. That's it. Other feature ideas were taken from previous parts. To sum up, this flick is worth watching especially with your mates.",Final Destination 3
150,Minerva_Meybridge,Pointless,1,1 February 2010,"This film actually has a worse ending than No Country for Old Men. In terms of writing, amounts to a murder mystery where in the end, the detective says, ""Well, I just can't figure out who did it, so let's go home."" It terms of writing, it's like watching Armageddon (bad in an of itself) where in the end, Bruce screws up and the earth wins up toast. Some present-day writers like to convince themselves that it is somehow cool to have a movie end where no one wins. But the fact of the matter is that it is just poor writing skills. A good writer always plots out his story beforehand, knowing how it's going to end, and coming up with a clever solution. Let's take this one, for example. Death stalks the survivors, because they were supposed to die and Death is miffed. So, how do the final characters cheat death? Maybe on of their parents is a doctor and they need to convince him or her to induce death, then bring them back to life. Maybe they find out the spirit that is doing this, and discover a way to stop it. But to just leave everything unresolved for the sake of a sequel is cheating the ticket or DVD buyers, not Death. Look at how well the Ring was done. So, despite the fact the both writers have great credits (the X- Files, the Lone Gunmen, Millennium, Space Above and Beyond) they apparently still need some lessons in their craft.",Final Destination 3
151,LinkGoku,probably the most intense entree in the series,7,23 August 2010,"Well after the first two movies i was intrigued by this movie.Its surprisingly more intense then last two movies, and the deaths have become much more creative.The acting was actually better i think then in the last two, Mary Elizabeth Winstead was mediocre, Ryan Merriman was the best secondary character so far in the series, and the otter co-stars were actually convincing.I also liked Tony Todd's vocal appearance, it wasn't an award winner but just like the last one it was a really fun gore movie.And thats why i give FINAL DESTINATION 3 7/10",Final Destination 3
152,Phantasm01,"More of the Same, but still fun",7,30 June 2006,"Well, reviewing this is easy enough: If you saw and liked the first 2 'Final Destination' films, go see this one. If not, don't. That's about it, but I'll go on some more anyway.Major release horror movies are always bound to be a mixed bag, particularly because this kind of film leans towards theoretically fun horror movie rather than the, well, horrifying sort. And this is definitely true of the 'Final Destination' films; it's hard to imagine anyone being terrified or disturbed by them provided they aren't a small child or a complete pansy. I prefer serious horror films, generally, but this sorta thing can work too, and FD films are some of the best horror movies of this kind to come out in recent memory. FD3 is certainly nothing more than reiteration, but the original ideas are amusing enough for another go round, and this one proves to probably be the best of the series. (It's a tough call, though. They're all in about the same range, quality-wise.) The premise is exactly the same as the previous two films: A high schooler, Wendy, has a premonition of death just prior to riding on a roller coaster and flips out, causing herself and about half a dozen others to get off the ride. The premonition, of course, comes true, and they're all spared. But apparently Death isn't so pleased with this and proceeds to off them one by one in the order that they would've died during the accident all via bizarre, impossible coincidences and accidents, and if you escape the trap Death passes you by and heads to the next person. Wendy, as did the other FD protagonists, has premonitions of sorts regarding the impending deaths and, adding a new wrinkle to the plot, they also discover that the numerous pictures that they took prior to the roller coaster ride contain clues as to their future demises. Thus, after the opening, the film is just a series of set pieces where they're killed via elaborate contraptions interspersed with scenes of them standing around and talking about how they're gonna die, and how that sucks and all.The film gets off to a somewhat slow start. They probably spend too much time at the spooky carnival and the roller coaster crash itself proves to be fairly unimpressive. A roller coaster disaster sounds good in theory, but I dunno how you're gonna actually shoot this effectively, and apparently Wong doesn't either. It's okay as it is, but the disasters in the previous films were better, particularly the spectacularly over the top crash from FD2.Once it gets going it's better than ever before, however. Wendy is probably the most likable protagonist in the series, though that's not much of a prize, and the most annoying characters are generally killed first. Furthermore, they just generally spend less time standin' around and talking and more time getting' killed. The set pieces are the most consistently amusing and perhaps most elaborate ones yet in the series, though I won't discuss them too specifically as that would kinda ruin it. (There's nothing quite as ridiculously amusing as the teacher death from 1 nor as great as the squishing from 2, but it's got wonderful consistency.) The film is about as gory as mainstream horror gets, definitely on the level of FD2 if not higher and far surpassing the original. (Which sadly, had little gore to speak of.) It's also got a few relatively original deaths, though I emphasize relatively, as there just isn't a whole lot more you can do to the human body that hasn't been done yet. On top of the high gore quotient its also got probably the most painful, vicious deaths in the series, giving it a bit more visceral punch, though it's still a fairly light hearted affair, as far as horror films go. (Spoiler Alert: Particularly note the roasting via tanning beds and the chick receiving about half a dozen nails thru the back of the head from a disturbingly high powered nail gun. Ouch) Wong and Morgan wrote the film again, and it's got some of the old humorous touches from the original that didn't make it into the sequel, or weren't as affective and noticeable, anyway. Overall, it's just a bit smarter and better written than 2, though that ain't exactly what you're looking for when you go to this sorta film.Sadly, Tony Todd (the Candyman) isn't back as the creepy mortician. Sure, I thought his appearance in 2 was kinda silly and unnecessary, but once the pattern is established I figured they'd continue with it. Too bad. He is back, however, in a sufficiently appropriate role, I suppose.On a final, insignificant note, there's a scene where they look at a photo of the WTC supposedly just before 9/11 where there is a phantom shadow of an airplane on it. (This is supposed to connect in with the idea that the photos can show how the deaths will occur.) This is very amusing, as it will certainly offend plenty of whiny babies and it's surprising that they'd dare do this. (I haven't the faintest idea why this would offend people, but I'm absolutely sure it will. If I really understood why something was offensive I'd be offended too.) Anyway, good for them. It's rare to see the film business not be cowardly, particularly for no good reason.",Final Destination 3
153,wastebot,"Needs more Ashley and Ashlyn, less melodrama",4,12 July 2006,"Definitely not as well done as 2, but the FX and creatively staged deaths remain exceptional.The acting and dialog, however, are even worse. The only exceptions are Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe that play Ashley and Ashlyn, the over-tanned, rich-kid airheads who are, of course, responsible for the nudity. They are also, contrary to standard practice in teen horror, the best acted and take part in the most entertaining scene in the film, which, of course, takes place in a tanning salon.That scene alone does not make it worth watching in a theater. As a cheap full-moon rental that you can replay and fast-forward to the other deaths, it works.",Final Destination 3
154,andell,"If a formula works, rehash, rehash, rehash!!!",6,10 February 2006,"In the first Final Destination, a student's premonition of impending doom aboard an Airplane led to several students and a teacher being evicted from the doomed flight, only to be picked off one by one by an unseen force in the most peculiar ways.In the second Final Destination, a student's premonition of impending doom on the Highway led to several people being spared from the doomed roadway, only to be picked off one by one by an unseen force in the most peculiar ways. Note, for the most part, both of these explanations are identical with the exception of a different word here or there.So, what do you think will happen when the third Final Destination is set at an amusement park.Now don't mistake my comments for overt or ruthless criticism, because in many ways, I will admit that I enjoyed this movie- but only on the same level that one might appreciate a well placed raspberry sound from a younger sibling at the most inappropriate time at a wedding between people you really can't stand.This time around, Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Wendy, the weepy high school ""control freak"" whose foresight saves her life and the life of many of her class mates. Of course, after the fact Wendy retreats into a bitterness that causes her to reject all of the other survivors, especially her best friend's boyfriend Kevin (Ryan Merriman) when he tries to suggest that another force might be at work. Ironically he isn't given the opportunity to convince her, however when she convinces herself, he is no longer convinced. Go figure!Of course, as is standard fare in this franchise, we are treated to wind, and shadow, and usual hints about the doom that is about to come, and in turn dooms each of the survivors until there are only three left.No doubt fans of the franchise will readily accept and enjoy this film, but for those who haven't seen the first two movies, I would recommend putting it off until you see them.And for people who, by nature, are not fans of horror or gore, but who are nonetheless interested, I would recommend you stop at the first one. Parts 2 and 3 will no doubt seem like the repeated whipping of a dead horse.And here's a premonition- coming in 2009...Final Destination 4- at sea!",Final Destination 3
155,badgrrlkane,Was better than I thought it was gonna be. But the storyline isn't as strong as the 1st 2 films.,7,6 May 2006,"Not (to me anyway) as good as the first 2 films in the franchise as the storyline in the first 2 films was better, as this was written & filmed pretty quickly from the looks of things. However,the death scenes are at their most brutal( & enjoyable for a gore-hound like me)as these teens are wiped off the face of Earth in mostly brutal deaths, that had me hollering out Brutal! Watching, the 2 bimbettes roast like 2 turkeys at Thanksgiving was underling as the scenes where their skin was bubbling up like their blood was boiling was vicious! And, from there the deaths just keep getting more hard-core. Mostly no name teen/early 20 yr old actors in this one. Former Passions actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead was actually good as the lead actress (especially since she was AWFUL as Jessica Bennett when she was on Passions in 1999). I wouldn't be surprised to see a 4th installment as this is the one killer no one can stop, DEATH! Also, i really liked that all of the characters die at the end of the film. That made the film a lot more decent in my opinion. *** out of *****",Final Destination 3
156,FlorianLaur,Give credit where credit is due,6,4 March 2020,"I thought this movie is pretty fun. It seems that Wong understood well what makes these movies a guilty pleasure. Basically, although considered horror, these movies are so cartoonish, you can't help but laugh.
Mix some unlikeable characters nobody would cry for (a guy who kills pidgeons with a nail gun for fun, a guy who is ""in control of his life"", an ungrateful person like in part 1, 2 arrogant bimbos), some creative deaths and piece it all together with the lore about flight 180 (and take it full circle in part 5).Of course these movies are easy to pick apaet or dislike. These aren't Oscar winners. But they usually include a cute girl and guy(so men and women have something) and are just fun to watch if you don't overthink it.I give it an entertaining 6.

Put this all together and what do you get? Final Desination 3: Lack of Originality.Fine, you can leave the brain at the door, go in and watch the spectacle of people getting killed in new ways if that's what you really want to do. This makes it more of a date movie, which is fine. Those looking for a shocking new horror should probably look elsewhere however, as this film is basically the first one all over again.For the most part the acting is decent and the whole film is generally competently put together. For me though it just seemed a bit of a churned out cash-in.Bottom line - for a date movie or a no brainer to put on while you and your significant other cuddle on the sofa, not a bad choice.

Even though it was obvious that they wanted to give closure to this series, THEY KILLED IT.The first movie was a classic and the sequel was a solid follow up, but this movie was a confused attempt to cash in on a valuable franchise.If you want originality, entertainment, action or a decent story make sure your destination is anything but this film.It's hard to believe that the creators of the original put this half assed attempt at suspense.I will admit that it was hard to hear all the dialog with all the laughing going on in the theater, but I assure you that is was most likely not worth the effort.

Well, BAD! the first two films the setups were quick and the deaths were cool and quick. Did I mention the death scenes were quick? well, in #3 there is about 15 minutes of 'set up' and by the time the death scenes occurred I really couldn't care. And the big roller coaster death? It was almost 30 minutes into the film! and this was the 1st death!!Plus, this is number THREE! Why did they have to spend SO MUCH TIME explaining the theory of cheating death - even having to talk about what happened in #1? Was this really necessary? And in #1, but especially #2, the films had a neat awareness not to take themselves too seriously. But here EVERYONE is SO serious - there is never a wink-wink, nudge nudge to the audience and nobody looks like they are having a good time. Most of the film seemed to be about the leads crying and being depressed and taking everything SO SERIOUSLY.Honestly, I couldn't wait for the film to end.

161,jason_13,Really good sequel,7,6 July 2006,"Yes, Final Destination 3 is indeed a surprisingly good horror movie. The first two were very original and the third one somehow manages to be enough original and interesting. Any horror fan should be satisfied, no matter if he's had low or high expectation. It has great deaths and new characters involved with another scary death chase story.The bad thing about the movie is the ending. It's stupid. Like the creators haven't paid any attention on that particular scene. I don't feel like using spoilers and discuss each second from the last 5 minutes. I just didn't like it. It was predictable, it was badly shot and it certainly wasn't clever.Then, the first scene. The second bad part. In fact there are only 2 bad parts for me. The beginning and the ending. The second act is very well shot which is the biggest positive surprise of modern horror film-making since Creep. Movies like FD depend on breathtaking opening sequence and twist ending. Look at the first two movies. Both have classic opening scenes. This time, it just doesn't work. Why? Well, a couple of months before the movie came out, the scene was revealed and the expectations were higher than ever. How have they shot that? How big is this going to be? How great FD 3 is going to be? Things clearly went out of control. Then the poster which includes the roller-coaster sequence. That sucks. I knew I won't love that scene. Even if I ignore the high expectations factor which would be a big mistake, the scene itself is not that good. It's like a video game. You know who is gonna die and you see these death scenes in an attractive XXX 2 way with lots of CGI. Try again.I've given a 7 and yet, I have big complains about the structure of the movie. It's ridiculous, but I just felt that the other 60 minutes were more than original for a third part. You know, simply respect. Good camera, something happens continuously, the story develops in a fast, but yet understandable way without boring explanations, good looking gore. Yes, pay attention on the gore. It's so great. It's not that much, but it's very good and it appears when you expect in the least. I don't mean that the average viewer won't expect violence and gore, but he/she would be surprised from its graphic.7/10",Final Destination 3

I saw the promo for this about six months before it was released, and as a fan of the first two i was so excited about this one. So i have just finished watching it on DVD and i am still full of adrenaline. From the opening scene i was buzzing with excitement and i wasn't left disappointed. I was a little apprehensive, considering the second movie, although it was good, i felt was lacking something that the original made so exciting. However, the third installment goes back to the same format of the original. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that James Wong was once again directing ( he wasn't in the second one). The whole roller-coaster accident blew me away and sent shivers down my spine, it was absolutely brilliant. It did sort of dwindle after that for a while, but picked up the pace again when the first victims get killed. Overall I was pleasantly surprised that the third installment was back on the right tracks(no pun intended). The only thing that bothered me was the end, but would rather an ending that doesn't tie up loose ends and everyone lives happy ever after. This way we are left guessing.

Duh. And what did you expect from any film that has a numeral in the title, and the title has been used in other films. This complaint is as pointless as saying that one does not like the Bond series simply because there are beautiful women, flashy cars/gadgets and an opening segment that involves a hellacious stunt. Again: DUH.In defense of FD:3, let us turn to the opening death sequence. The first was an airplane crash, the second was a (brilliant) mulitvehicle auto accident (sidebar: I work in an 800 # call center for one of the top 5 insurance carriers in the US of A, and I have taken that claim!Or at least, its really close cousin...) and this one starts with a roller coaster.Now.Why does one ride a roller coaster? You can see how it starts and track it to the end. There are, really, no surprises on a roller coaster. You know what to expect and when. In concerning these engines of falsified machines of mayhem, there are two types of people: those that cannot wait to get on and ride, and those who walk on by.For those of you who walk on by, that prefer a deeper, more intellectually challenging ride, please, do walk on. Feel superior. Feel as though you have something of great value to offer the world. Feel free.For those of you who stand in that line, watching and listening and giggling... get in, strap in and put your hands in the air. Yee ha! Loop de loop!

170,Pet_Rock,Another pretty good sequel...,6,2 August 2006,"Now, it's Wendy's (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) turn to have a dream of horror, this time on a roller coaster. So her and a few others get off of the coaster but of course, a few die. Well, of course there has to be a neat little twist and this one is: Clues of her friend's deaths are in pictures taken on the night of the accident.6.5/10 In my opinion, each film just keeps getting better... by .5 points. The first, IMO, was a 5.5, the 2nd was a 6, now this one is a good 6.5.Why do I like this one the best? It tries hard not to sag as much as the others. While the first one left us in utter confusion, and the 2nd one tried hard to be tricky, this one really gives us a fun task: Trying to guess HOW the person will die based on the picture.The opener is the 2nd best one in the series (Nothing beats the original's opener), and the Quantity of the deaths are better (3 good death scenes) but the Quality of them is best in the first (2 GREAT deaths)",Final Destination 3

I was wrong .........,7,14 February 2006,"I'm not gonna lie to ya, i wasn't looking forward to final destination 3.Just seeing a roller coaster full of screaming people on the poster made me roll my eyes and assume that this franchise has run out of steam .So you can imagine my surprise to find that final destination 3 is a entertaining , funny and shocking thriller that proves that horror sequels can be pretty darn good if handled properly .Directed by james wong with style and a pace that hits the ground running ,the film is very much like a roller coaster in its self - fast,packed full of laughs and most importantly full of frights .The film is essentially a remake of the first film only with a different cast, gorier deaths and a higher level of self awareness.But this is a rare case in which copying the original isn't a bad thing- it keeps that sense of inventiveness and wit that made the first one great. It may be a clone , but its a very good one !Final destination 3 is gory ,homourous and clever fun that will make me think twice about my horror sequel prejudice....",Final Destination 3
172,CyMaddux,Nail in the Coffin for the Series....,3,15 February 2006,"First off how can 35% say this is a ""10"" there is no original concept here at all and surely the acting is not worthy to push it that high. What we have here is the third installment of a decent concept thriller movie that literally falls flat on its face- and meets its death.The actors (outside of the female lead) are dry, stale and frankly, much too old to play teenagers. The deaths themselves are downright miracles which would fail to happen even in anyones worst nightmare. What kept FD1 and FD2 on target with the audience is that most of the deaths, ""tragedies"" if you will possibly could happen, from plane crashes to highway accidents, etc.. Well FD3 has NONE of that. Firstly, a roller-coaster is not going to lose every wheel and fly off in segments before some kind of security system is in effect. We can clearly see on the roller-coaster control board that there are a plethora of buttons and controls- surely one of which shuts the ride down, stops the power, etc. Anyway, after this we have two stupid 20 somethings playing cheerleader type prissies that get ""locked"" in their tanning beds and fry by one single wooden board. They do everything under the sun but DO NOT try to remove this board which is stuck between the two beds and could clearly be seen from the inside of the tanning beds by BOTH girls. Keep going, there are more including absurdity in a wharehouse where a NAIL GUN penetrates the skull (BUllspit) to weights coming off a bench press and squashing a guys head. This movie was thrown together without little regard for what made FD1 and FD2 fathomable: A chilling visage of reality gone wrong.. Well this movie has no threads of reality, and thanks to FD3, no threads of continuing the FD line.3/10 primarily for lead female acting (worth a point) and background scenery",Final Destination 3

But this time the unhappily events are built up really carefully, much more intense than in part 1.The characters were quite alright, except for the punk like dude which picture isn't on IMDb. He really acts childish and simply doesn't fit in the picture.Loved the fact that during the movie they refer to the events of part 1 and 2, that they read on the internet.

176,phillipstephenso,Snuff Film Oscar?,8,7 February 2006,"This is an exciting sort of horror film that explores the capacity for death to appear in the urban environment. One of the actors, in fact, explains that 150,000 deaths happen every day. So, it is part of life, really. But, for the typical modern teenager just graduating from high school, this is unexpected. Their minds are too preoccupied with the search for the perfect mate and the perfect tan. So, this film, like so many other horror films, exploits the charms of this age group that is barely old enough to depict suffering a hideous death, whether by being crushed by a runaway roller coaster, impalement, being burned alive in a tanning machine, smashed by an out of control truck in a fast food drive through, and other equally sad endings to a short life. Life may be short for American teenagers in the narrow alleys of Baghdad or in the teeming jungles of Vietnam. It is a shame to reflect it may be short even in the relative safety of our urban jungles, too. The actors and actresses are all appropriately charming as they are offed in entertaining fashion. Perhaps, this might be classified as a masterpiece of the legal snuff film industry. A special Oscar category?",Final Destination 3

Unfortunately, 3 is where the fun ends until 5 came out, bringing true horror back into the franchise. If you prefer your horror zany and unserious, refer to Final Destination 3 and not Final Destination 4. The physics of some of the accidents are all extremely silly however they're truly effective and almost whimsical in their approach of making us paranoid of drive-thrus, tanning machines and fairground rides. It's not a bad franchise, its just a dumb one and that's really nothing to be ashamed of. Every class needs a clown.",Final Destination 3
179,yfguitarist,Most suspenseful horror franchise out there. On par with Misery and Panic Room and better than High Tension,8,25 July 2006,"Wow. This one left me breathless. I bought it the first day it came out because I'm a fan of the first two. Each one has inventive death scenes and very high tension and dread. The gore is realistic and the deaths are gruesome. This is definitely tops in the thriller/horror genre. The third is basically a repeat of the first, but with more gore and creativity. This film utilizes chain reactions with ingenuity. The director is a master of suspense. He throws in many references to masters of horror such as Hitchcock in his films. People seem to dismiss these films as just another teen slasher flick but they deserve more credit. I found it more intense than most of the highly-rated suspense films *cough*High Tension*cough*. It's on par with Panic Room and Misery. There are some genuine shocks as well. If you love gore or suspenseful thrills, buy this without hesitation. The director James Wong managed to combine the two, which is something you don't usually see. He's also self-aware and there are humorous bits thrown in. It may even be better than those two flicks because he uses gore to create horror and suspense, which usually just goes for the in-your-face type of reaction. FD1 and 2 are just as good as 3, 2 being the silliest. All have horrific accidents that'll make you at least hesitate before getting on an elevator, roller coaster, or airplane if you don't already. They're all intense but the first is the darkest. Check them out.",Final Destination 3
180,Duzniak38,Love Roller-coaster!,10,18 February 2006,"I have been a huge fan of the Final Destination franchise for ages, and I couldn't wait to see the third movie. This film contains some of the most inventive and scariest death scenes ever. What works for me with the Final Destination films is that they are mentally scary - unlike films where people are stabbed, and the scare is then over, these movies make you afraid of everyday items we use in society. The tanning bed death scene is possibly one of the most scariest and sickest death I have ever scene. The attention to detail was excellent - a song about a roller-coaster AND a song which carries an urban legend about murder (Apparently ""Love Roller-coaster"" carries the recording of the screams of a woman being murdered) was great, because it highlights the past events on the roller-coaster, and emphasises the urban legend of cheating death. And what makes these films work is that they make people weary and afraid of things such as aeroplanes, trains, tanning beds, lifts, rollercoasters and hell, even pigeons! The graphic gore in some of the scenes was fantastic. Some of the painful deaths really stuck in my head, like the girl being stabbed to death by the automatic nail gun, and the other guy who was squashed by a huge sign. Even the shot afterwards, showing his chopped body in half, wriggling a little bit, was scary! The story is wearing a little old now, now that we're using the whole storyline again in each film, but what's great about the movies is you can be extremely inventive with the death scenes. Two thumbs up, extremely enjoyable, tense horror.",Final Destination 3

Like a roller-coaster, nearly everyone who goes on one thinks ""oh god will it crash"" etc.. and there's a fact that you are most likely to die on your way to a theme park in a car crash than actually die on a ride there, so everyones pretty safe, but it still makes you think. In the part of the film where the coaster crashed i thought it was pretty darn good and exciting. Then following on and the events that happen when they haven't died are fantastic (in a disturbing way), when the stupid blonde characters are in the tanning booth was brilliant and again made me think twice about using one.I'd strongly advise to watch it, is very jumpy and unexpected things happen........",Final Destination 3

The main connection in this movies is death only. Nothing more. So, don't worry about missing the main idea of the movie since it's not going to happen. Actually, the reason I watched this movie, was because I was interested in how those people die. But believe me, most people only interested in the way those teens die (for those who have watch the first two, they will be quite familiar with the plot, and for those who haven't, well I believe you guys aren't dumb to know the plot in a matter of hours.)

183,nived84,"Silly, but ultimately entertaining",6,17 May 2006,"Final Destination 3 is a silly and over-the-top splatterfest of blood and gore with a little tongue in cheek humor sprinkled on top. By now we already know what's going to happen in the opening minutes of any Final Destination flick; someone will have a horrific ""vision"" involving a group of people getting gruesomely killed, the person freaks out and ends up saving a few of the people, cheating death, only to find them being stalked by death later on. We know this is going to happen, and we know that death is an impatient bitch that'll stop at nothing to bump off those who have cheated him. One by one the survivors are slaughtered in ways that look like horrific accidents, usually in the order in which they would have died in the fatal accident that they escaped from.Final Destination 3 is rooted very much in formula. We know the rules of this game and we sit and watch, and laugh, and shriek and are momentarily grossed out at gruesome scenes of vivid spectacles of death. I can't think of another film or film series that seems to have such a fun time at bumping off members of its cast, one after another, joyously and cheerfully as the Final Destination series. The film doesn't make any attempts to stray away from clichés or tired stereotypes; instead FD3 embraces them only to make fun of them. There's the independent and smart young girl who tries to save everyone and it helped by an equally handsome young man, there's the two ditsy hotties (who you can bet at sometime will take off their clothes, and they do), the self-centered jock who thinks he's invincible, there's the Gothic teenagers who don't give a crap about death, and then there's the horny loser just looking for a good time. We've seen this all before, over and over again, but FD3 is perfectly aware of this, so instead of pretending that we haven't seen a hundred times before the film just aims to make fun of such idiotic caricatures.Where does Final Destination 3 fall in the series? Is it the best of the three, or is it the worst? I think it's better than part two, but not quite as fresh as part one. The best part of part three is that it does seem to be somewhat unpredictable. We know that these people are going to get it in the end, but how it happens is what keeps us watching. The film does a good job of keeping us guessing just how these people will meet their end, and most of the times you won't really know until it actually happens. The ending in FD3 is also probably one of the best in the series. It's not as hokey as the first two films, but is still satisfyingly different. I also really liked the idea of an amusement park roller coaster going out of control and slaughtering people to be a really fun and scary concept, but the sequence isn't quite as good as I was hoping, but still frightening. The highway pileup is still the best of the three.Final Destination 3 doesn't try to tie into the first film like the second one did (which I didn't think worked all that well). The Flight 180 crash is only mentioned briefly in the film, but for the most part this one stands on its own. Final Destination 3 is silly and ridiculously over-the-top, the song that's played during the tanning bed scene had me rolling my eyes and laughing out loud. This isn't a serious horror flick like The Hills Have Eyes, but if you're looking for a gory splatter movie that goes down easy and doesn't require you to think too hard you'll probably get some enjoyment out of FD3. Love'em or hate'em, it looks like Final Destination and Saw are the new Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St. series for the 21st century.",Final Destination 3

But if that had ever happened at a carnival then it better be at my school it's boring. But I will never look at a tanning bed the same way ever again(I loved that scene best death ever!). I did like the concept that a girl was trying to save everyone from a horrible death. My favorite deaths in this film were the roller coaster, tanning bed, weights crushing(weights crushing down on head like a melon), and the nail gun death. In the DVD version it had lots of features like you can change the way a person dies(tanning bed- turn up the heat more, same death), you can watch how they did the roller coaster scene(all the actors on the ride had to ride that roller coaster at least 40 times or more a day for filming) and lots of other goodies to add to your scare scale. I loved all the features but they should have done a little more to the roller coaster scene(cut back on the computer effects a little bit) it was completely obvious that every thing in the film was used by CGI effect techniques. I loved every minute of this film. I hope they make another film like this with all the survivors dying at the ending because no one can escape death.

Once again, there were scenes that were totally awesome and disgusting and I freaked out just like I had with the other ones before. There was this couple sitting in front of us and the guy would cheer when they would show a scene with someone getting killed in a really bad way like getting crushed to death. I admit that it's cool but I wouldn't go to the extreme of cheering like saying ""Right On"". It's only a movie with very good special effects and everything.

REEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLYYYYYYY crossed the line with so much gore and violenc that i threw up several times. Final Destination 3 however was different. the violence level was pretty high, which made the film just as disturbing and in bad taste as FD2. basically, it's the same story repeated over and over again, except the deaths are different, the main disaster is caused by something else that's pretty obvious, and the characters are different. just stick with the first one. it's not as graphic nor as obscene as 2 or 3. 2/10The acting was good though. but the deaths were disgusting",Final Destination 3
187,GrimmBrother,A roller coaster of outrageous freak accidents,6,24 December 2006,"If you are interested in movies about faulty roller coasters, gruesome premonitions, clues hidden in photographs, stupid teenagers and tanning beds, then Final Destination 3 is for you.The story is basically the same as the one before and the one before but this time it is a broken roller coaster that causes the deaths of innocent people.The premonition is seen by a high school girl named Wendy. She is attending a carnival with her classmates when they decide to ride a roller coaster.While waiting for it to begin, Wendy has the premonition and tries to stop the ride, but naturally no one believes her. A few others do manage to get off but the ride still goes.All hell breaks loose when the roller coaster does in fact crash and all the people who did manage to get off start being killed off in gruesome but sometimes hilarious freak accidents in the same order they were meant to die on the ride.It's up to Wendy and her recently-deceased best friend's boyfriend to try and stop the deaths from occurring by finding clues in the photographs Wendy took while at the carnival for the school year book.When the teenagers were standing in line to get on the roller coaster, I felt that same exact feeling as I do when I am about to get on a ride like that one. I felt their fear as the ride was about to take off and the feeling of anxiety when the roller coaster is going up the track in the beginning of the ride.The premonition scene was done brilliantly but it wasn't as good as the previous two movies with the airplane and the car pile up. The deaths in this movie also weren't as creative as in the first two but they were still rather interesting.I was also pleased to see that the movie ended differently whereas the first two had similar conclusions. The acting and the dialog was alright. I've seen better.What really annoyed me the most was the two scenes where Wendy mourns her boyfriend who died on the ride. It seemed too soppy and just didn't fit the mood, although it does show that the film makers have a heart.The acting was average and so was the dialog. I'm sure the film makers did not intend for the audience to laugh at the deaths of the people who were meant to die on the ride but people in my cinema (which was sold out by the way) found some of them amusing. The film makers have also made the film suspenseful especially when death is creeping up upon the teens. You never know what's going to happen.Final Destination 3 makes you want to notice everything around you. It makes you want to look out for any freak accidents that might suddenly occur. There is one main message though. Don't cheat death. No matter what it will always find you.",Final Destination 3
188,ryshpr,"Not As Good As The First Two, But Not Bad Either",8,5 February 2010,"This review contains minor spoilers.I think I'll probably remember Final Destination 3 as the last decent movie in the franchise. Don't even get me started on The Final Destination.The premise is much like the previous two films. A group of teenagers cheat death due to a premonition of one member. This time it's a roller-coaster and it starts be borrowing elements from the 2006 remake of The Omen in terms of photos being taken that reflect the future fate of the people in it. If it was original, it'd be a pretty good idea.The opening sets a pretty effective scene and builds tension despite the fact you know what's going to happen anyway. As usual, the premonition scene is pretty extravagant and detailed. It's probably one of the best scenes in the movie and not many of the later death scenes compare to it in terms of how gory and fast-paced it is.Following the usual Final Destination storyline, for some reason one of the main characters researches on the internet to look for an explanation for what happened. Is that something you'd do if something similar happened to you? Didn't think so.The death scenes are pretty great. I'd say they're probably better than the ones in the first and second instalments. Without ruining too much, the deaths of Erin, Ian and Frankie are pretty much the best ones.Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Alexz Jonhson stand out the most here. Winstead is great in the lead role (apart from when she's constantly moaning, which gets kinda annoying) and Johnson does some fine acting herself, despite being in the movie relatively less. I'd recommend giving Final Destination 3 a watch, it's just a bit of harmless and brainless fun.Kevin: ""Spongebob lives underwater"" Wendy: ""It's so sad that you know that"" To be honest Wendy, it's quite a common thing to know that.http://ukmore.tk/",Final Destination 3
189,morphion2,The A-Grade franchise of a C-Grade genre,5,13 May 2006,"Teen-horror, as a genre, is one that society tacitly understands is not to be taken seriously. The dialogue is largely failed by both writers and actors, the plots are ridiculous and the gore is excessive. It is in this light that the ""Final Destination"" series, most of which were directed by James Wong, is really the A-Grade franchise of a C-Grade genre; the premise is promising and the direction is impressive, but at the end of the day the films have no choice but to submit to a lousy formula and pander to a supposedly brain dead demographic. Sadly, this means that all three films are effectively moderated down to a generous ""B"".In the latest installment, the trendily abbreviated FD3, near-graduate Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and her near-graduating class take a year-book photo trip to the local carnival (effectively portrayed by Wong and cinematographer Robert McLachlan as the Festivities of Satan), where she has a horrible, graphic and suspenseful premonition that the Roller Coaster of Attraction will malfunction and derail. Petrified, she evacuates the ride and manages to take 6 others with her, including her best friend's boyfriend Kevin (Ryan Merriman). When her premonition indeed comes to pass, Wendy is initially wrenched with guilt that she was not able to save her boyfriend and best friend, until she realizes she has a whole lot more to feel guilty about: as was the case with the doomed Flight 180 from ""Final Destination"" (2000), Death is being a stubborn bastard and coming after the survivors of the wreckage to claim the 7 fish that got away.In keeping with tradition, and following a formula obvious from the moment the original film was released, FD3 is, more or less, exactly the same as its predecessors, even if the plot is becoming a little worse for wear. In all fairness, anything less would have been an outrage to hardcore fans of the series, who really just enjoy watching cynical teenagers get their grisly, grisly comeuppance. And as long as we know what we're in for, we shouldn't be too horribly disappointed (at least until the very last 15 minutes, which entail an embarrassingly bad ending). This is mainly because James Wong is actually a very talented director, one who has managed to, momentarily at least, breathe the long-lost art of suspense into the genre. For instance, the opening premonition scene is a rather splendidly devised crescendo of paranoia, whose tension is practically palpable. The climax of the introduction is also surprisingly exciting.However, it soon becomes clear that the film makers had not thought any further than this one scene, and so decided it would be safest to simply repeat these techniques over and over and over again. In between scenes of Wendy and Kevin investigating their predicament to give the illusion of plot development, two airhead 18 year old girls (Chelan Simmons and Crystal Lowe), an aggressive black football player, (Texas Battle) a Sherman-like sex-obsessed geek (Sam Easton) and, my personal favourite, a cynical Emo couple (Alexz Johnson and Kris Lemche) meet their maker in imaginative ways, many involving disfiguration of heads. By the half-way mark, the spooky scenes of infinitesimal happenings and chain reactions of inanimate objects resulting in roastings and decapitations has pretty much lost whatever it was that made it interesting and it wouldn't surprise me if most of the audience walked out thinking they liked this idea a lot better six years and two sequels ago.Be that as it may, any one who honestly expected something in the vein of ""Misery"" or ""Don't Look Now"" going into this picture deserves the nasty shock they got. You can't order fast food and complain that it's not healthy. And every one else will hopefully be able to see that this was as good as it could possibly have been and reserve harsh judgment. If not, then perhaps a brief viewing of ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" will help put things in perspective.",Final Destination 3
190,Fenris Fil,A basic Rehash of the previous films,4,24 August 2006,"Okay, positives first. The death scenes were well done, the acting was reasonable.Now the negatives. The plot is basically a rehash of the first film, once again. Naturally they've tried to add something new and it's not a particularly thrilling idea and doesn't add a lot to the films (on the other hand it is better then the angle they took on the second film, but that's not saying a lot). The idea has gotten old now and this even makes the killing technique a little dull and the supposed ""twists"" incredibly predictable. Anyone surprised by the end of this film obviously hasn't seen the previous two (or just doesn't pay much attention to such things).Everything pretty much runs like clockwork so you don't really need to care about the characters at all. Just sit back and enjoy the excessively complex but still impressive death scenes and appreciate the fact the film isn't particularly long and doesn't loose it's pace between death sequences.Even with the positives the fact is this is just a rehash of the first two films and that is too huge an obstacle to get over. The film actually bored me because of this and I hope now they will finally put this idea to rest. The first film had a great concept and good sfx and not a lot else, it was enough for it to be put down as a good horror. However the sequels have now stripped it of it's originality thereby actually managing to devalue the original while not really providing anything to write home about themselves.At a 4/10 this makes the film a very disposable but not quite pointless horror. Watch it with your more talkative friends and lots of beer and you'll be fairly happy. Watch it alone and you'll probably be as bored as I was.",Final Destination 3

It's an opportunity to see a few creative ways for people to die, and you're guaranteed to jump, laugh or find your toes curling in tension at least a couple of times during these films.The same certainly applies to this third instalment. It's fun. It doesn't take itself too seriously. It's fast-paced, and yet still manages to draw the audience in. I really hope there's another instalment or 2 of this series somewhere down the line. They're always such a treat to watch, and, for me personally, the concept isn't tired.This probably relates to the fact the 3 films released so far have been polished efforts, and spaced out by 3 years or so between them- the series has so far managed to avoid the ""lets release as many as we can as soon as we can"" trap and, as yet, avoiding devolving into some half-hearted straight to video effort, as many other teen horrors (urban legend, wrong turn, i know what you did last summer) have.",Final Destination 3
192,sjstobo22,Great!!!,9,15 April 2006,"Well what can i say? I was a fan of the first film. It was an original idea something that was never done before. So kudos to the writers for that film. As for F3, i liked it. The death scenes really are what make this film and there's no denying it. Some good acting especially Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She was so convincing as the one who had the premonition. Everyone played their roles well and i enjoyed the film. As i said before the death scenes were what made the film worth watching, i know i liked it. The idea to do it in a theme park was good. I hope they finish it with this one else if they try to do a fourth I'm sure it will not do any good. Keep it at the three and thats that.",Final Destination 3
193,worthythorn24,"Hopefully, this will be the FINAL Destination.",3,18 February 2006,"Have you ever had a really good idea? One that was original, creative, borderline innovative? Yeah, me neither. However, the people who brought you ""Final Destination"" did. The first film was very entertaining, suspenseful and unpredictable. The inferior, but also highly entertaining sequel brought more of the same. But as the old saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Well, with Final Destination 3 the formula has finally ran out of fuel.We begin at a carnival, where we're introduced to some teens from the local high school. They decide to get on a roller-coaster (plane) when the lead girl (see also Devon Sawa, Final Destination) has a vision of a horrible accident (see plane crash, Final Destination 1. Highway wreck, Final Destination 2) where everybody dies. She goes into uber panic mode and several of the kids get off, sans her boyfriend. Well, the coaster does indeed crash and kills everyone who was riding it. Now, fast forward a little while and ""death"" begins to pick off the survivors systematically. I am surprised death just didn't initiate the U.S. military nuclear launch codes and just blow the entire city up.I'm not even going to chronicle the absurd ways that the survivors die, but I will tell you it is quite gruesome. Almost gratuitous, but of course that's what draws people into the theaters these days. Unfortunately, almost all of the gore appears to be CGI and looks very fake. The appearance of the film was pleasant, as the director gave us some interesting POV shots of the victims. The acting on the other hand, was not so pleasant, but no worse than the other movies in this genre. The best performance was probably from the lead actress, as I felt she was the only character who was believable in her role. Tony Todd is not in this, but he does provide the voice of the devil on the roller coaster.I'm giving this movie a 3/10. If there are truly 2 certainties in life (death and taxes), then Final Destination 3 is certainly the ""death"" of the series.",Final Destination 3
194,max_111,Better than expectations..,7,22 May 2006,"before seeing this movie i was thinking that it would be another junk like final destination 2 but after watching this movie i was totally wrong...the idea is the same..one thinks of dieing and save his/her friends and after wards death is taking them turn by turn..the story is a little bit changed like deaths are occurred by the scenes in pictures taken before the roller coaster ride...overall the movie was good and i liked every part of the movie..the acting was good..the girl in the leading role was superb as she can do acting well and can show emotions at several points..the death scenes in the movie were breath taking, different from the first parts..the idea of the roller coaster ride was also very good..and after watching this movie, one will think a 100 times before sitting on a roller coaster..lol if you like death movies and final destination 1 you will surely like this movie..it has every thing one can expect in this type of movie..",Final Destination 3

Number 2 had some great ""jump out of your seat"" moments, along with that really great highway scene!!!!! WOW! The whole theater was mesmerized with the action. But number 3 was slow and lack luster. The deaths were ""yawners"" and kind of stupid. We were not spooked or nervous or grossed out. It was all very ""ho hum"" and we were sad :( Also a lot of the actors, who were supposed to be high schoolers looked about 27 or had boob jobs (not enough boobs were shown to make the movie worth seeing). When your popcorn is better then the movie, give it a 3. Disappointing.",Final Destination 3
196,conmech,Good Trilogy,8,7 January 2008,"It is a fact that the horror movies never give the same effect in the sequels, because it's the same topic and you already know what's going to happen. For ""Final Destination"", it's someone cheats death, and people start dying. However Final Destination Trilogy has been successful to entertain me every time. The main reason is, something new is added up in each movie. For this movie, it's the girl takes photos before the big accident happens, and after a few days, she realizes there are clues in each photo she has taken of how her friends are going to die. It's a good idea, and it was also applied very well to the movie, so it successfully manages to surprise and keep you curious.Also, people start dying in more creative and vicious ways, which was bound to happen to keep the sequels alive. I like the horror movies where it SHOWS how people die instead of being lazy to make the scene and making screaming sounds and flickering shadows instead. Because it is the hardest part in a movie, making a believable, yet gross death scene. FD3 definitely didn't try to avoid that, and made a very good job, so you can experience a few more ways a person can viciously die in a freaky accident.",Final Destination 3
197,hayabusa-1,More of the same,3,12 May 2006,"Fortunatly for me I saw Final Destination 3 at the dollar theater and it was worth every penny, but not one penny more. I enjoyed the first Final Destination movie, and the second movie held my interest, but the third installment falls short. It's a sequel to a sequel and nothing more. I had higher expectation for the film going in. The premise of the series of movies is good, and the writers and directors are missing out on a chance to flesh out something teased in previous movies, but quite lacking in this movie. What is death's plan, how does it work? Can it be beaten? Sadly there is very little mention of death as an entity or force in this movie, and we don't get a deeper look into the inner-workings and intentions of Death. By the third movie in the series I think it's time to unlock some secrets to keep movie goers intrigued, but sadly Final Destination 3 is just more mindless teenage gore.",Final Destination 3

FD3 was a major improvement over the mediocre second one, that in my opinion didn't live up to the original, except for the macabre opening death sequence that in my opinion was better than the original. The opening death sequence on this one is pretty scary too considering the fear of about 55 or 60% of human beings of heights and rollercoasters. The death sequences that follow afterwards do not disappoint, they keep you on the edge of your seat and when they finally come they leave you screaming for more. The acting is of course third-rate but who cares, no one expects top-notch actors in these kind of flicks or really care about what happens to them, which is what makes watching movies like this all the more fun. Really recommend it if you're in the mood for a popcorn flick.",Final Destination 3

The deaths are more innovative, which makes sense, considering they've already done some more cliche deaths in the first two.The major accident at the beginning was a lot more small-scale, but I don't think that detracted from the film at all.This could be considered the start of the downfall of the franchise, but considering I really, really enjoy the 5th film, it's more accurate to say that this is just the humpday of the Final Destination Franchise.Watch it if you've seen the first two and enjoyed them.",Final Destination 3
200,S-Reisner,Best movie of the year!,10,18 February 2006,"This is by far the vbest movie of 2006 (besides big momma's house). The gore is pretty much non-stop which goes for the killings as well. I loved it, every scene was good and some of the girls were kinda goodlooking.I wont give away the deaths because you wont expect any of them. I never expected how every little thing could be a part of someone's death. Just like in all the final destination movies, the story is terrible but its a great movie. I didn't find one flaw of the film, except me and my friend were laughing every time someone died.Its better than I thought and the goriest movie of the year.

The only death I thought was far-fetched was the warehouse scene, that was a little... much, but it was SO cool how it came together. Also, the truck at the fastfood place... Overall, this was simply an amazing movie. If you liked the first two you'll LOVE this.Overall, this isn't just a movie for gore and violence, because even though it is very brutal none of the deaths are dwelled on for an overly extended period of time, most of the death scenes show a lot of blood and gore but momentarily, it cuts away fairly quickly.",Final Destination 3
202,Davyd420,"Same story, just more creative ways to die.",7,30 March 2006,"Once you've seen Final Destination there's not much more of the story to tell, or twist, or reveal. All three films could actually be compiled together to make one long film, in other words, the story is told and the scene is set in part one, the two that follow just get more creative with how messy, bloody, and bazaar each person is slaughtered. And thats why I love these films.Final Destination 3 is really no different than the two before it, except the creepy bald morgue guy who seemed to have a fetish for death does not make an appearance in this one. There's not much to say, if I told you how each person were sliced, diced, smashed, crushed, impaled...you get the point, then I would be revealing the only reason any of us purchased a ticket. There is no denying those who seen this one in theaters were there just to see how bad death could be dealt. Let me tell ya, ""There's some really sick and twisted ways these people die."" Anyway, for those who enjoy gross and disturbing this one is worth checking out. Enjoy!",Final Destination 3

Now, I watch violent movies. But, usually there is death for a reason. In the movies I watch, people get what they deserve. Not only that but, there is a descent plot behind it. No, not this movie. This movie is what I call ""shock value"" which I hate. Excluding ""The Aristocrats"". Just one more gratuitous death after another. It is the same plot as the first two only, more graphic, more brutal, and much much stupider. I don't know about you but, I don't want to watch innocent people get, split in half, grinded into red goop, and have the back of their heads chopped off for no apparent reason. Death would usually have a reason for killing people in horrible ways. But, nope not in this stupid movie world. It sucked raw a**. Do not watch this ""violent just to be violent film"".",Final Destination 3
204,burbs82,VERY intense,8,15 February 2006,"I was a big fan of the original 'Final Destination'. It's creators came up with a really original and intelligent concept. Death being a seemingly live entity, with its own predestined plan for all of us, which it must follow through to the end, even when thwarted by those with a kind of sixth sense that allows them premonitions of that plan thus allowing them to temporarily change it.The original had me on the edge of my seat...The second film, not so much. I just wasn't very impressed by Part 2. I've seen plenty of reviews bashing part 3 for as much as a person being unable to suspend their disbelief that the equipment utilizied by tanning beds shouldn't go over 250 degrees. I'm assuming this person works on or designs tanning beds for a living... or at the very least, he/she actually uses one. I don't, so I really don't know how a tanning bed works and don't really have to try THAT hard to imagine that such a malfunction could occurr. Anyway, I notice that all these people have absolutely no problem with Part 2, and in some cases, claim to like it even better than the original. Ummm...Part 2 was LAME. These people who have difficulty suspending their tanning bed equipment malfunction disbelief have no problem accepting the pathetic cast and the ridiculous characters that they play, or the fact that Part 2 tosses aside the whole 'order of death' motif halfway through the film and just starts killing people at random. Clear should have been the LAST to die if Death was working backwards, etc., and that's just one of a thousand things wrong with the movie. Sure, Part 2 had some cool gore, but it just lacks the intelligence of Parts 1 and 3.Part 3, on the other hand, is a delightful return to the intelligence and suspense of the original and had me once again on the edge of my seat. Horror movies don't even phase me anymore. I've seen so many of them (some multiple times) that they all seem so by-the-numbers to me. Final Destination and Final Destination 3 are two very big exceptions.I really couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Sure, it had those cheap shock scares that make you jump, but it had more. It had that which truly elevates a good horror movie over the usual standard fare. It creates a feeling of dread. Also, like the other two films, it really allows the viewer to involve themselves by trying to figure out who's next and how ""Death"" is going to off them, although unlike the second film, it IS possible to actually do this.Final Destination 3 is one of the better horror movies I've seen since the original came out several years ago (and with all the horror films released in between that time, that's really pretty sad). See it and enjoy.",Final Destination 3

Let's think about part one: it was fun to figure out who would be next and how he/she would die and when then death-trap finally collapsed... but here? sorry... perhaps I was in a bad mood but I simply didn't feel like there was any plan at all... people survive, people are confused, people die because of their arrogance and stupidity? well... was that the message of the movie? that movie had no climax, no thrill, no story, no plot... just repeating the first one, and even twice! I'm sorry, but this is really not worth any money at all... for those who still want to see it: don't spend any money on it, don't support the companies to make more movies like that! Well... last but no least: the roller-coaster-ride was nice, not as scary as the plane-crash in FD1 but still... and here are my wishes for part 4: please introduce the death as a person, change the perspective of this idea, don't repeat itself... oh, and if you want to make better traps: ask MacGyver... perhaps he could build a better mouse-trap...",Final Destination 3

They also no longer have to have any characters who you remotely care about. Lastly, they don't have to have suspense OR logic. OK OK.. I can deal with some of these key factors out of whack but all of them? The only thing you have here is a ""B"" movie that is a rehash of the first two films but not done near as well. Yeah, it is worth a rental if you want to burn an hour and a half of your time but don't expect anything great from FD3. The characters are cheesy too the max. If this were a Friday the 13th film that would be OK because you are actually rooting for their death due to their ignorance but this isn't. The movie seems to want you to care about the characters yet gives you no reason to care. The SCARE factor and suspense are non existent in FD3. Each bad event is so for-casted that you see it coming a mile away. The ONLY thing FD3 has going for it is some neat gore FX. If you expect what some of these other people are telling you then you will be left asking if someone is getting paid to write these ludicrous reviews that praise FD3. For a silly ""B"" horror movie it is worth a watch. For a movie that actually got released in theaters it is a disgrace.",Final Destination 3
208,AloysiusWeasley,Looking for a gore-fest thriller? You've found it!,8,14 November 2007,"All right, so this movie does have its bad spots and pretty bad characterization, but for what it's made for, it excels.The bad? None of the characters were different or unique in any way. They basically rounded up a set of clichés from ~insert high school here~ - we have the goths, the preps, jocks, and most annoyingly, the stuck up b*tches who worry about nothing more than how their tans will look at the graduation (Yes, I cheered and laughed when they died). They put in a particularly annoying GCI scene when the roller-coaster actually crashed that was eye-rollingly bad. I also thought perhaps it could have included the surviving characters from the last one, just for a touch of continuity in the series. Lastly, I had a few moments of confusion when the lead characters were with the goth kids (who were cleaning and closing up a large hardware store for the night) - how did they NOT hear the things crashing to the floor and the walkie-stacker still moving? But honestly, in retrospect (I watched it last night), I can't think of anything else I didn't enjoy.The good spots? Well, it's blindingly obvious how the stuck-up chicks are going to die, but I found the other deaths to be if not out of the blue (duh), then shocking, to say the least. The lead character tried to figure out how everyone was going to die by using pictures she took of them before the roller-coaster crashed, and there was just NO WAY you could have predicted it. It was much more one of those they died, and THEN you saw what the picture was revealing. I always enjoyed the Rube Goldberg-esquire way the characters seem to die - they show a couple things happening, and a few minutes later, it shows how those small things were the catalyst for what happens to a character. Lastly, there were no (rather cheap) cop-outs by any characters surviving by ending up in a padded cell - rocks fall, everyone dies. Just when you thought they'd cheat death by skipping the order (saving someone), everyone ends up together on the same subway car...This movie left me feeling two things - extreme paranoia, and the hope they are going to make a fourth one! Granted, I did like the car crash in the second one much better than the roller-coaster (Best car crash in a movie EVER!), but the initial vision of the 'coaster crash was pretty neat. I also felt the overwhelming feeling that I suppose was the moral-of-sorts of the series - death is inescapable. Bottom line - if you're looking for some gore and some scared jumps of surprise, along with a movie that will have you looking around corners and seeking signs all around you of impending death, this is definitely the movie for you!",Final Destination 3
209,shizz_27,"Best movie of the new year, so far. Is it possible??",9,12 February 2006,"It's gotta suck to know how you're going to die, what's it going to take getting there and it's the end result no matter what you do or how you do it. Especially for a self-proclaimed ""control freak"" like Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). She and some friends, and a few other people she just kind of knows, are getting on a roller-coaster when she sees it take an ugly turn: guy disobeys the no loose objects rule, the safety bars come free and everything f**ks right up. She gets off; others join her. Others don't, and... well, you know.And, like both FINAL DESTINATION movies before it, you know that cheating death is a no-no. Figure out its ""plan"", save victims, and it'll improvise. So, as soon as Wendy and Kevin (Ryan Merriman) find out about a certain airplane explosion and freeway pile-up, and how the death ""force"" tracked down survivors and offed them, anyway, they go to the digital photos Wendy took that night and start looking for clues.FD3 suffers from repetition (aside from being exactly like the first two films in this series): gruesome death, main characters lament, try and stop the next one, can't. Repeat. But, it doesn't suffer much. It's better acted than even the second installment - which I thought was darn good. Winstead is convincingly trepidatious about getting on that coaster, has a believable freak out. There's also a nice meeting of the minds scene between her and her rebellious kid sister. I liked the two stereotypical airheads, how they give each other an adorable little pound. I liked the brutality and ingenuity, and just sheer screw-PG-13 of the death sequences. Tanning beds that become incinerators, a nasty little drive-thru incident, the opening carnival ride -- all expertly done. The climax is absolutely fabulous. The dialogue isn't horrible; ""If there's any place that makes me feel like there's no life after death, it's a cemetery."" There's also, I thought, a pretty good point made about ""the equality of death"", during a funeral.Sameness notwithstanding, FINAL DESTINATION 3 is a blast. Surprisingly, impossibly, the first really good picture of the new year. Now, fourth go round, maybe have skiers on a chair lift, it stops because someone accidentally misses their chair (been there done that), and a small low flying airplane plows into them. You could even start using, ""based on real events"" if you wanted; I think I read about that actually happening, once.",Final Destination 3
210,limejockey,much better than I was expecting,7,15 February 2006,"I went into this without expectation, knowing that the basic premise was not going to change, which is death making sure it takes what it wants to even when people intervene. It's all about the inventiveness of the killings in these movies, and this one doesn't disappoint. Mr Wong knows how to stretch the suspense for as long as possible and the actors seemed near perfect for their roles. I believe that Mary Elizabeth Winstead is gonna be a superstar if she keeps up with this and doesn't succumb to the pressure of attempting to make it in her field and the rest of the cast does well with what they are given. Overall not Citizen Kane, but if you're looking for a decent gory horror movie with some laughs and a reasonable well told story, you could do much MUCH worse than this.",Final Destination 3

At the time I was fetched with European art house wonders, which I convinced myself that I liked and that were very enriching and chocked full of vitamins or something. I am now convinced that the old studio actor was right. There is nothing wrong with something that works, whether an entertainment or a more artistic piece. I found Final Destination Three to be a wonderfully entertaining movie. What I like about thrillers and caper movies is the validation of ingenuity and perseverance. What we think and do is important. The characters in Final Destination know their number is up but never give in to resignation or despair. They don't anesthetize themselves against the inevitable or wave religious relics at the force in the dark. They keep to trying till the end. I liked the nude scenes and the imaginative demises. We might infer that the mysterious force has some connection to Rube Goldberg. Final Destination Three is fun and familiar. It is like re-reading The Ghastly Crumb Tinies.",Final Destination 3

213,jason06-1,The Best Entry Out Of The Trilogy,10,7 January 2007,"Plot: When Wendy has a premonition of a roller coaster crashing killing her ,her boyfriend Jason, her best friend Carrie, and Carrie's boyfriend Kevin and everybody else on board she causes a riot and gets herself, Kevin, Ian, his girlfriend Erin, Frankie, Lewis, Ashley and Ashlyn, Julie, and Perry chucked off the ride. The roller coaster does crash and the survivors realize they narrowly cheated death. A month later the survivors start to die in weird accidents and Wendy discovers clues in her pictures that she took of the survivors the night the roller coaster crashed that they show clues to each character's death. Using the pictures Wendy and Kevin race against time to save the survivors from their fate.The Good News: As I stated in my summary this is the best out of the trilogy. It's action packed, brimmed to bowl with blood and guts, clever death scenes, and an awesome roller coaster crash that takes minutes to finish. Wendy's premonition of the roller coaster crashing tops the plane crash in Final Destination and the highway pileup in Final Destination 2. Before I go on I just want to say that this is the first Final Destination movie I saw and it got me started in the series. I then watched Final Destination one and two, with 2 being better if not by a lot. Then we come to this entry directed by James Wong who directed the first movie. I didn't really care for the first Final Destination so I didn't know what to expect. What I got I couldn't believe, everything was played out to perfection. The clues in the pictures was also a neat twist that I enjoyed although some people might say it's just a gimmick. The best death would have to be in my opinion the first one at the tanning salon. Beautiful, ditsy cheerleaders who want the perfect tan, we all know what happens to them in these kind of movies. Which brings up another point that I stated before, the gore. DO NOT see this movie if you are squeamish or have a weak stomach. For a movie buff like me the gore is a plus. Remember how bloody Freddy vs. Jason was? This one almost tops it. The deaths are played out very well and could happen to you today, this afternoon, or thirty years later you never know when you will die which is what I find so scary about life. You never know when your life will end and when you will die. The Bad News: NoneCharacters: Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead): Mary did a great job bringing the heroine to life on the screen and you feel sorry for her character as she goes from happy-go-lucky teenager to the best heroine the trilogy has had yet. Kevin Fischer (Ryan Merriman): As the boy next door Ryan really brings the hero of the picture and Wendy's love interest to the screen although he could have been a bit more believable at places. Ian McKinley (Kris Lemche): As the goth kid Kris brought a lot more to the screen then just being around for the sake to be killed, which he is of course and he is really the most developed character next to Mary Elizabeth Winstead and you believe every word he says and it send a shiver down your spine especially in the finale. Erin Ulmer (Alexz Johnson): Her death I rate the second best in the film, but other than that her only purpose in the film is to be a character to get killed by a very complex nail gun accident. She is the angry goth chick who is just really mad quote FD3 special features and she is also very pretty. Frankie Cheeks (Sam Easton): The most annoying character in the whole film and one would wish he would just shut and be killed. Which I think was intentioned by the filmmakers and it certainly wasn't Sam Easton's fault who actually preforms pretty well although it's not hard to play a sleaze bag. Lewis Romero (Texas Battle): Along with Frankie Cheeks the second most annoying character in the film and he goes out with such a BAM that one can not feel like cheering death on when it's his time. I look forward to seeing Texas play the hero in Wrong Turn 2 with Final Destination 3 co-star Crystal Lowe. Ashley Freund (Chelan Simmons): Unknown actress Chelan Simmons delivers the goods in this film and is very pretty and is part of my favorite death in the entire series where she and Ashlyn burn to death in a couple of tanning beds. Ashlyn Halperin (Crystal Lowe): One of my favorite actresses, Crystal Lowe delivers the goods in the film and is extremely HOT! She is also part of my favorite death in the entire series where she and Ashley burn to death in a couple of tanning beds. I look forward to seeing her in the remake of Black Christmas co-staring with FD3 lead Mary Elizabeth Winstead and in the upcoming Wrong Turn 2 co-staring with FD3 co-star Texas Battle. Julie Christensen(Amanda Crew): One of the most likable characters in the film. Amanda Crew did a great job of bringing her to life on screen and she's a joy to watch and one hopes she survives. Perry Malinowski (Maggie Ma): She's in the film for 2 seconds and she's Asian, and she's Julie's friend, and she gets speared by a flagpole and thats all we know of her.Final Verdict: If you haven't seen this film already go see it, you will be happy you did.Rating: R for strong horror violence/gore, language and some nudity",Final Destination 3
214,trackstartrox,Scary at it's BEST!!!!,10,20 March 2006,"I went to see the Final Destination 3 and this would be the only movie from the series that I have seen, but I was amazed by how scary this movie was and the tricks that were used were also good. The film basically follows a bunch teens many of them seniors, I'm guessing, go to this theme park and decide to try out this roller coaster ride. One of them, Wendy(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets scared and she had and gets off the ride, and interesting enough, 7 others also got off the ride. Those 8 kids, who got off would soon realize that life comes with a price. This movie got me scared right from the beginning and I was still shaking after I saw the movie. The movie uses a lot of behind the back scares and a lot of good tense moments.A MUST-SEE!!! 10/10",Final Destination 3
215,cutie_mcpretty,Very cool,8,19 January 2008,"I was very weary of this film at first. Gruesome deaths are not at the top of my list for film priorities. Once I had heard some of the stuff that happened in it though, curiosity got the better of me. I have to say I was very surprised. I loved it. I knew the basic plot line. Kids get on roller-coaster, kid gets premonition, kids get off roller-coaster, kids start dying in freak accidents. I really liked how this film was gruesome, sure, but not exactly scary. It's one of those violence films that isn't pointless, but isn't so scary that you can't sleep. The deaths are rather horrible, as you can imagine, but I don't think many people would have a problem with them. I'm terrible for deaths and violence, but I managed this film. I actually watched it twice in one day. I like the concept of this film. Simple, yet it keeps your attention. I like the way it links with the first one and how the pictures give them clues and that's even linked to other pictures in history. I would say that the scariest part about it is the song that is played three times in the movie that tells her that there is something behind her that she has to look at. That song, I have to say, is a bit creepy. The acting is great, by all seven actors. They can all scream extremely well. The deaths are very visual, but it doesn't linger on them for too long. I totally loved this movie. I think if you enjoyed the first two, you'll definitely enjoy this, or even if you haven't seen the first two, if you are in the mood for a bit of violence and having nothing to really think about then watch this.",Final Destination 3
216,Weisz_Man,Very Entertaining......enjoyed every second,10,20 November 2006,"Being a big fan of the previous Final Destination movies I knew I would love this one as long as it stuck to the formula. Not only did this movie accomplish the task, it left me squeezing my boyfriends arm a few times too many, a good sign that the disturbing scary horror parts did their job! I liked al the new characters introduced, a class of McKinnley high school seniors celebrating end of their schooling with a wild night at the amusement park. The whole movie does not take the place in the park, only the beginning, the place of unspeakable horrors and lot's of bloody bodies.Mary Elizabeth Winstead in head role as Wendy Christensen was a new face to me but a joy to watch on the screen. She had a really disturbing premonition of the roller coaster ride breaking, and while everything happened as she imagined, the remaining people who thought they were lucky had no idea what horrible things would await them. I was shocked at the gruesome death scenes perfectly set up in a cat and mouse style of a game. It reminded me of those old fashioned Dominoes games I would play, arranging the pattern on the floor for hours, then at one push one thing led to another and the whole design pushed forward slumped in a mess. That's how death worked in this movie, one misplaced object would leak onto another, push a cart then a bottle toppled over, wetting a heater which in then increased the temperature in a tanning booth while two saved girls tanned in. A coat hanger tripped by an air fan showed the bookshelf on top of the booth locking them in, that is how this movie happens. There are no bad guys, no monsters , no ghosts, just that evil draft and unfortunate coincidences that somehow brought boys and girls to bloody pulp. All of the death scenes were amazing, as much as disturbing, they were really shown in full detail, as I had no idea this movie was going to be that hair raising. The roller-coaster scene itself was incredible, totally disgusting and something I will love to see again.The best, well the most disgusting death scene was with the nail gun, you guys who have seen it know what I am talking about, I was shocked yet at the same time I was really impressed at the effects and the poor actors. Overall a great fun movie, a blast to watch and really gory but interesting enough when you care for the characters.I loved trying to figure out with them how to cheat death and seeing their failed attempts and small successes lead somewhere. I hope more parts will come out, as I can never get bored of this theme!",Final Destination 3
217,phizzle21,"nice deaths, poor rest",4,10 May 2006,"I've seen the first one and I remember it not being too bad. It didn't have much of a story, but at least it came up with a sort of innovative concept to surround the all the deaths and some solid acting. The third part, however, is just poor, concerning characters, logic, dialogue, acting, script and all the other stuff that is important to create a good movie. All this shows even more, because the idea of Death and trying to trick and escape it is already known and so there is not much left to surprise you or make you think. There was no noticeable pattern in who is surviving or not or who is next or what exactly happens if one person is skipped. So even the last options to draw some tension out of the ""story"" were spoiled.Nonetheless, I give the movie a 5. Why? Because I was entertained. The film gave me what I expected. Pretty gory deaths surrounded by a none existent story. And here is, what I liked about the movie: the ways of dying and the ending. The deaths were pretty creative and some of them even were surprising, because they didn't happen the way you expected them to. And most of them come up with some tough gore. Especially the tanning bed scene is pretty gruesome.It is just too bad the filmmakers could not really decide what they wanted. They tried to throw in some character development in form of horribly cheesy dialogues or stupid family-scenes, but then just didn't follow this idea or finish it. This way it's neither half nor whole. There is no irony or so in the dialogue-scenes, but they still made me laugh. It would have been better to either really focus on storyline and acting or (what I'd have preferred) to leave it out completely and use the time for some more brutal dying.In the end, this is NOT a good movie and I would only recommend it, if you like gore or are a fan of the FD series.",Final Destination 3
218,lilac_point_burmese,Disappointing,4,14 August 2006,"MINOR SPOILERS The first film was different, gruesome and one of the genuinely scary films I have seen in a while, the second film was scarier and more gruesome and actually achieved a deeper level by sorting out the mystery at the end, but this one just seems to have been made for cheap thrills.It is gruesome, the roller coaster idea is everyone's worst nightmare, I think the car accident scene in Number 2 was possibly one of the most gruesome teen horror film events in history and was much more impressive than the FD3 scene.This film seems to go back to the first one, it ignores the advances made in the second film and seems a bit pointless. The girl was annoying - actually the characters in general were annoying, I much preferred Ali Larter at least she had a bit of attitude, this one could stand in for Bambi.This film just rehashes old material in order to screen some more gruesome death scenes, it could have been better.",Final Destination 3
219,coastin_on_a_dream,"Fun, but lazy and nothing new",6,19 July 2006,"""Final Destination 3"" is a very fun, atmospheric movie but doesn't really add anything new to the series.The movie is basically about Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and her friends who get on a roller coaster. Then, the ride turns terrifying when it loses control and Wendy and all of her friends die. Suddenly, Wendy realizes it was just a premonition, and she's sitting on the roller coaster before it's started. Wendy demands she gets off the ride, and as a result, the manager kicks her and her friends off. But low and behold, on the roller coaster's next ride, Wendy and her friend's witness the terrible roller coaster crash, the ride they would have been on. A few days later, Wendy realizes that they were meant to die on the roller coaster, but survived and that death is coming back at them, killing them off one by one.That's basically the plot in a nutshell, same with the first 2 movies. The main problem is that the movie is too sloppy, too rushed. It seems that they were just throwing in random death scenes to please the audience, and that was it. Not much of a plot. Sure it was fun, you'll jump a few times, but when I left the theater I was like, ""...okay? that was it?"" The movie provides nothing new to the series, and for the most part, it was predictable, despite somewhat of a twist ending. Really? Were the filmmakers that lazy that they couldn't think of anything new? The roller coaster scene was well done, as were the deaths, but why didn't I care about the characters? The character development was nonexistent, and as a result, they were just a bunch of random, stereotypical, one dimensional characters that the audience didn't care about at all. However, it did provide somewhat of a creepy atmosphere, but nothing we haven't seen before. It was a fun movie, but honestly, it was just a rehash of the first 2 movies.",Final Destination 3
220,rosepetals495,Okay,6,29 July 2006,"I was a little weary about seeing this movie, mostly because I haven't seen the first two. Most horror movies nowadays are horrible!! This one wasn't as bad as I anticipated. I think that the nudity was un-needed and I found it very predictable (which I think was the point).The predictability made the movie kind of boring. They showed how everyone was going to die before they did, so it didn't leave a lot of suspense... until some of them didn't die. I also like the fact that they didn't know who the other 2 people were, so they were looking all over the place, trying to figure it out, while along the way, people were dying.The football player's death, I didn't even watch, because I thought it was going to be too gruesome, I suspect it was because of the sound effects. Most of the deaths were so far fetched, it was kind of ridiculous. Let me tell you, I'm never going to a tanning salon!! Those two girls, oh my God, that looked so painful!! The ending I thought was completely predictable, because, well, they all HAVE to die, so... But it seemed kind of obvious that Kevin was going to show up on the subway after Wendy's sister did, and then when the train crashed and Wendy saw the other train coming at her, it was predictable that it was going to be a dream sequence again. But the ending was excellent, none the less.",Final Destination 3
221,catlin_massier,Pretty darn good!,7,11 July 2007,"I saw the first two movies and I was wowed, I hadn't seen anything like this, the third movie to me became a must see. And when I got this movie, the minute I popped it in I was happy about the Choose a destination option on this ""Special Thrill Ride Edition DVD"" that's something that something close to what I've dreamed of a DVD to have. I've always wished that a DVD would allow you to include all or some of the deleted scenes into the movie to make it one. Because sometimes watching DVDs you see scenes that you think are awesome that were cut from the movie. If you have read my other reviews you know that I'm in favor of full frontal female nudity, or any female nudity at all. And this movie had it. The actors are supposed to be around 17, which gives away the fact that they aren't because that would be child pornography and would be aloud it the movie. However the gore in this movie was pretty good, I liked the ""token black guy's"" head exploding. When I first popped this movie into my DVD player, soon into the movie the ""premonition"" happened, and had the same effect that the other movie's premonitions had on us. If you had seen the other two movies, you know that it's coming, and movie trailers always give away the good parts. I think a movie can be more entertaining if the trailer hadn't been watched. But I guess they kind of have to make them to advertise the film. If you are/were a fan of the first two movies, you will enjoy this one. And unlike some of movie sequels/trilogy's this movie does relate to the first two. It was just as good as it could have been. And by the way, if your gonna buy this movie buy the ""Special Thrill Ride Edition"" because it adds a whole new experience to the movie.",Final Destination 3
222,arlum_meow,A real let down.,4,29 July 2012,"final destination starts of with Wendy and her high school friends enjoying a theme park. taking pictures of her friends while they was playing a game. when she faces up to her fears and gets on a rollorcoaster she would never forget she has a terrifying premonition that the roller-coaster was going to break and kill everyone that is about to go on it. so just like the other 2 final destinations she saves a group of her friends which are all part of deaths list, so there all going to die any way. so 2 of her high school friends that cheated death die in a freak accident so then history repeats its self once agin. death killing teens in the order they were meant to die ont he rollarcoster.sounds like the coolest opening so far right. well don't get happy till you see the movie. final destination 3 was a real let down with no new twists and bad acting from very unlikable characters. i new it wouldn't be as good as the first 2 but with final destination 1 and 2 being masterpieces i would at least expect final destination 3 to have some new twists and turns but i was sadly mistaken.even tho final destination 3 did have some good death scenes that cant save the whole movie. at what point does the final destination stop because its gone worse through out Tue series.avoid this film if your looking for a good trilogy with the same feeling that the first 2 films gave you.if you haven't seen the first 2 films you may like this film but its really not a good film.4 star",Final Destination 3
223,Allendorf,Plain predictable but still equally intense!,7,13 February 2006,"I've seen the previous two final destinations before- and I regret to declare that this third one is the worst of the three. This movie is not bad entirely, in fact - I gave it 7 out of 10. It is just not as good as if you compare it the previous two.There is not enough twist in the third one, and much of the story has been revealed in the trailer. With that being said, the storyline is once again predictable. The movie has focused too much attention on the original storyline and thus have no meaningful improvement/drawback from the previous one (exact same story). Although the story has not shifted much, and in fact has been equally intense, my third experience of watching somehow same storyline of final destination have been deteoriated.And that concluded my review since there is basically nothing really new. For final destination lover be sure not to miss this film (althugh a huge reminder of its predictability has been put forth)",Final Destination 3
224,nolanm_182,"Nothing new or original, but still an entertaining sequel",8,16 February 2006,"Final Destination 3 is surprise surprise nothing new or original as with its predecessor. The only difference in this film is that the object that brings death to its young cast is a roller coaster. Final Destination is very cliché-filled with its dead-teen origins, but is well-made by the original's director James Wong. The movie is very graphic and gory with some very memorable deaths that will probably shock the ones with weak stomachs. Although, I'm sure this movie will make teens think twice before getting on a roller coaster, getting a tan, lighting fireworks, or stacking shelves with hardware. Final Destination 3 is sure to be a hit with teens who love horror films and is likely to please Final Destination fans. Final Destination 3 is a good film and an entertaining sequel.",Final Destination 3
225,Faena,Pathetic.,1,11 February 2006,"FINAL DESTINATION 3 is what ALIEN 3 is to that franchise. It's a step down from its predecessor, dull, with an unambitious plot. In fact I've nicknamed this one FINAL DESTINATION 3: THE SORCERER, since like the third HIGHLANDER film of the same subtitle versus its original entry, they're the same damn movie. Honestly, this is FD1 with a different cast, and a roller coaster.Breakdown: FD1 took an intriguing horror movie premise and buried it in a film that barely pushes mediocre, then FD2 successfully mined the potential of the premise and delivered a high quality, entertaining product. The freshest thing about FINAL DESTINATION 3 is the switch to a wider aspect ratio.What I can't figure out is how Glen Morgan and James Wong, who can be one of the craftiest writing duos ever (watch any of their X FILES or MILLENNIUM episodes, plus the fantastic series SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND) can take this wellspring concept absolutely nowhere. It's interesting to note that James Wong directed the first film, and now this one. David R. Ellis, director of the second film, and its writers, fashioned a superior product. Whereas FD2 gave us variety with its characters (a mixture of adults and young people as opposed to teenagers in the first film), FD3's victims are 100% teenaged. NEW LINE AGENDA: Target demographic: Covered. Ambitious film-making and storytelling: Incidental and of secondary concern.None of the deaths in FD3 are fun (that is the point, isn't it?). In fact, it seems more time was spent concocting Rube Goldberg-ish events to facilitate the fatalities. What this achieves is boredom, contemplation over how bored the filmmakers could have been doing it if you're this bored watching it, contemplation over how much work it must have taken to pull off these sequences, and how that's remotely possible when it's this dull, then no surprise when the character gets it, then astonishment at how simple and unspectacular the death turned out to be. That's right, there's hardly any gore this time around, unless you count a few CGI kills that have been shaved back to a total of 2-3 frames just in case the audience is too squeamish (or New Line was too cheap or lazy), SO DON'T BLINK IF YOU CAME FOR THE GORE!I was really looking forward to this one, but it's the standard Third Movie In the Franchise, Let's Play It Safe and Tell the Same-Story sludge.",Final Destination 3

A+ for me.",Final Destination 3
227,charlene_boyle,A sequel that is as good as the rest,7,19 June 2006,"Its rare for a movie franchise to be able to pump out more then a couple good sequels before the idea gets old. This franchise however, keeps on producing great horror movies. Perhaps its the whole concept that makes this movie franchise remain interesting and inventive. There's so many ways that this movie can go that you cannot get bored of the theme like you do with movies such as ""Friday the 13th."" The characters were interesting and it was well acted. The ending was excellent and considering the nature of the franchise we can't expect a happy ending, which is great. Too many movies guarantee a happy ending, with this franchise all characters are expendable. I hope to see more from this franchise and suspect I will in the future.",Final Destination 3
228,pbbuffyhugs,Fantastic!!,10,26 February 2006,"First things first. The whole point of this trilogy is watching the different ways the film makers kill off the characters. That's it. Hopefully along the way there'll be a reasonable storyline holding it all together but it's the deaths you'll be seeing this movie for and in that sense 'Final Destination 3' is by far the best in the trilogy. Lots of people have slagged off 'Damien: Omen 2' but thats probably my favourite film in that series because the deaths come thick and fast, you know what to expect and that film - like this - deliver the goods and if you liked that film then you'll love this. The opening roller-coaster sequence is awesome, the build up gets the adrenalin going and the buzz you get from watching it is just like being on a roller-coaster itself. It's such a rush and far better than the plane explosion in the first film and faster than the (admittedly brilliant) car smash up of the second. Mary Elizabeth Winsteads acting after her 'Flashforward' is nothing short of brilliant, her hysteria played to perfection as she's trying to stop the ride from going ahead and from that moment on you care about her character - something I never did with 1 and 2. The rest of them are just there to be knocked off one after the other in some of the most gruesome (albeit highly improbable but still very entertaining) ways, if any film in the series deserved an 18 rating it's this one, how it passed with a 15 is anybody's guess. After the sun bed BBQ someone actually ran out to throw up!! (Coming back for more though!) The atmosphere in the cinema was amazing and you could feel everybody's tension building with each death and their relief after each one only for it to happen again and again. I haven't had this much fun in a cinema for ages, the whole audience engrossed with what we were watching, no talking, no crisp packets rattling just everyone glued to the screen. 'Final Destination 1' was a good film, The second film made a mistake in having the best sequence at the beginning but this one has pulled off a masterstroke in having a second premonition at the end which equals any of the other three and just leaves you begging for 'Final Destination 4' (which has just got to be made because this series has in my opinion just hit it's peak). This is one film you can talk about for hours after it ends and as soon as it's released on DVD I'll be getting it. The few people who've made negative comments about this film have surely missed the point of this series, what were they expecting? 'Shakespeare' or something? Can't wait to see it again. My favourite movie of the year so far. Fantastic Film. 10/10",Final Destination 3
229,Angelfish_Solo,I just wish all sequels were this good.,10,18 February 2006,"As a fan of Horror Movies I was expecting this film to be rather like the first two, in that much of the gore was hinted at rather than shown (which for me ruined them), very thin characters and predictable outcome. How wrong I was. This is by far the best of the three films. I loved the ""keep you guessing which death option"" scenes (the gym will never seem the same again) and I believed in the characters, actually feeling for them. Rare in any genre of film, especially horror. I would recommend this film to anyone bar those who do not like the sight of blood.I just wish all sequels were this good.",Final Destination 3
230,solebanana,Lots of blood and gore but formula running out of steam,7,1 March 2006,"This is suspense horror done to a formula, the same formula in fact as the first two in the series. If you liked those you'll like this, though I don't think it's quite as good as the second. It certainly isn't a flop and it does hold your attention very well all the way to the end. The plot is again fairly preposterous, and at least once it didn't obviously appear to have followed its own rules. I should also say for the benefit of anyone who has NOT seen the first two, some of it is skated over a bit quickly, sort of a recap to remind regular viewers, so listen up when it comes. This isn't one to take grandma to. It delivers every quarter hour more or less, a lead in of perhaps half a minute or a minute signalling that something is likely to happen and some clues as to what sort of thing it will be. This is followed by perhaps fifteen or thirty seconds of fierce, fast and often gut-wrenching action. There is then usually some more plot until it's time for the next jolt. Like the previous two and particularly the second it does like to try and surprise you with details, so it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't play out the way it looks as if it's going to. You may also have fun guessing what order things will happen in, particularly if you follow the first 20 minutes or so closely, as you may get some clues there. Without giving anything away, the ending did suggest to me that they were thinking in terms of a fourth. I may be reading too much into it, but that's how it looked. My gut feeling is that this would be a mistake. Three times round for the same formula is enough. After a while it's too repetitious. Think of the Matrix series. Think of Clouseau and the Pink Panther. Time for Final Destination to take a bow and leave the stage.",Final Destination 3
231,killerreviewscom,The concept is getting a little stale but it's still fun at times.,6,13 February 2006,"It's been six years since Alex Chance Browning and his friends were pulled off of flight 180. Six years since an unhappy ""death"" came knocking, looking for those who had eluded the master plan. It's also been three years since Kimberly Corman experienced her premonition, saving the lives of numerous people, for the time being anyway. As far as time passing in the film, it's been about three years and now comes the time for me to venture to my local cinema for yet another juicy installment in the Final Destination series. Was I excited? Yeah, you could say that. They asked me to purchase another ticket for my erection The film opens in the usual manner: A young, attractive teenager has a premonition of a terrible accident that not only takes her life, but the lives of her dearest friends. Most of them just want to get in her pants but I'm not gonna tell the bitch that. The first film opened with an exploding airplane, the second, a traffic accident and now we have the roller coaster. The idea of an amusement park ride going haywire is great because everyone has thought about the seat belt breaking and the next thing you know, some kid's checking out your insides while chewing on a hot dog. The roller coaster accident was done fairly well but unfortunately, it could have been so much more. I wanted to see the roller coaster fly off the track into a nearby Ferris wheel or maybe a daycare Imagine that carnage. Popcorn and crayons everywhere I just didn't feel the accident was worth the fifteen minute build and it definitely didn't compare to the opening of its predecessors.So once this opening has commenced, we delve into the plot. Yep, same crap different day Death is after everyone who has survived the crash and our attractive lead, Wendy Christensen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), quickly discovers that the horror is just beginning. The only difference between the plot of this film and Final Destination 1 is that the hero has pictures that give her clues as opposed to visions. Besides the cast of characters, this is literally the only difference. The second installment was a great follow up because constant references were made to the previous film. The writers had not only continued the story but expanded on the concepts as well. Now we get to part three and only one, tiny, miniscule, forgettable reference was made to the previous films. I could have handled this if the writers didn't rehash the dialogue from the first film but we had to listen to the characters banter back and forth about Death and his master plan. We've already been there people! Honest to God, it was like watching the first film all over again but with a less charismatic cast. The plot was my number one problem with this flick, number two being the pacing, which was just a little slow at times.Even though the plot and pacing were off, the death sequences were as cool as always. The ten minute build before each death is getting a little stale but thankfully, the pay off was usually worth the wait. In fact, one death in this installment has come to be my favorite of all three films as a guy manages to get his skull mangled by a radiator cooling fan. We also have the joy of watching a nail gun rape the face of a young girl. Between The Nail Gun Massacre, Red Riding Hood and Final Destination 3, I've seen more people nailed than in the last ten pornos I've watched. Seriously, I have seen about fifteen people in the past few weeks that have met their untimely demise by a projectile from a nail gun. Speaking of pornos, we get to see a few busty bimbos fry in tanning booths and, although I have seen death by tanning before, it was not like this. We get to watch these two girls fry like sausages on a grill. Order up!! I have to say that the deaths deliver.After watching all three films back to back, I have come to a startling realization. Final Destination is Friday the 13th without the lake. Think about it the opening premonition is the equivalent of the camp counselors pulling into Camp Blood. Both events open the film and, during the sequence, we meet a group of young attractive teens that will ultimately die a horrible death, one by one. You with me so far? Then, you have a villain that can't be stopped and no matter what the children do, he will always manage to get the best of them. The only real difference between the two villains is that Death can't perform a cranium crush. Why? Because he doesn't really have hands, silly. Do I have to think of everything? Overall, when I look at Final Destination 3 in relation to the series, I have to say that it was a miserable failure. However, I rate each film as it stands on its own and when you do that in this case, you are left with a decent horror film that is worth seeing. Unbelievably enough, the film actually works better if you haven't seen the previous ones. I just hope that the next installment makes no attempt to continue any of the story lines. Just introduce new kids and have them spend their time screwing and dying, nothing more, nothing less Like Friday the 13th baby! Just don't give Death a hockey mask.",Final Destination 3
232,Captivity,Best of three,8,9 August 2006,"I saw the first ""Final Destination"" and I liked the story line, of someone seeing something that will claim lives and stops it by saving his self and the lives of others. I also like the way it was constructed but the first film fell apart after the first half-hour.The second film starring a return from Ali Larter and also starring A.J. Cook and Michael Landes was okay. Same story line this time they try to save other people. Not always succeeding. The director was directed by someone else. Not Glen Morgan or James Wong.The third film I rented and watched it on a road trip with my friends and I really liked it. The acting of Mary-Elizabeth Winstead was good. Everything was good. The way it was set up the whole cast was perfect. I really enjoyed this movie. The plot unravels quickly and leaves you gripped till you find out the fate of Wendy (winstead). The story follows on Wendy Christensen (Winstead) who doesn't want to go on a roller coaster. She sits in the back with her friend Kevin (ryan Merriam). Suddenly she has a premonition that the coaster will crash, she starts to panic and scream and get really upset. She even sees her own death on the ride. She gets up and Kevin follows her suddenly a guy starts yelling at her and causes a commotion he slaps Erin Ulmer (Instant Star's Alexz Johnson) and then everyone else leaves the roller coaster. Soon in the order that they would have been on the coaster they all begin to die.Wendy tries to save them by the help of Kevin. She wants to succeed and beat death's trap. But death is very, very hard to cheat. Will she succeed or will she not? You have to see for yourself.",Final Destination 3
233,carlsbadrn,Three Strikes You're Dead,10,12 September 2006,"I love this series. The first was good because it was so different. The second had the best road wreck I have ever seen bar none. I'm still in awe of the entire, carefully planned scene. One of the most incredible and realistic crash scenes ever filmed. I just watched Part 3 on PPV and was delighted. We all know the plot, what happens and why, but it's always interesting to see how the writers are going to come up for new ways for Death to claim its victims. The opening scene reminded me a bit of (the remake of) The House on Haunted Hill so we were off to a good start. I loved the ending on this 3rd installment as well. It leaves an opening for a sequel and if not, it was a satisfying end. You can use your imagination to figure it out. If not for Glen Morgan and James Wong there would be no good movies to watch! These guys are great, with writing, directing, producing, whatever they do. They compliment each other wonderfully and I enjoy their work tremendously. When Space: Above and Beyond was on a wrote a fan letter and sent it to the studio. Imagine my surprise and delight when one time I received a hand written letter from Glen, and another time another hand written letter with a cast picture enclosed! I will treasure them always. The gore in this movie was there but went by so quickly you didn't have time to dwell on it. For me, I was more afraid of that d**n roller coaster! Those things scare the yell out of me! No way I would ever get on one, and after seeing this movie it only adds to my terror and fear of them. Want some good fun and lots of action? Then by all means see this film. Thanks Glen and James.",Final Destination 3

Hoping for a 6. I love some of the irony placed in the movie as well.This movie was brilliant. It was nice and gory but not so gory you couldn't watch it like some films *cough* Saw 3 *cough*. And most of all I had a fun time watching it as the jump scenes were good and it was full of quite comedic lines and actually quite sexual but I am now never going on a roller-coaster, to the gym, to a drive thru (F U MAC DONALD'S) or a festival.I recommend you watch this with your friends when you are in a fun mood.",Final Destination 3
235,crazy_chick0000,Very Interesting,8,17 February 2006,"I'd just have to say that this movie was a grand slam. OK so it wasn't all that good, but its good enough to hold your attention. If you have seen the 1st 2, the 3rd is a charm. It just makes you wonder how can you beat death this time. There is much more action and effects in this one. It is guaranteed to make you jump out your seat. For all you people out there who can't hold their stomach, this movie is NOT for you. The way it ended, I don't think there will be another one. Movies don't have a 4 or 5 do they? Unless you are Wes Craven. LOL! This is one of the coolest trilogies that are out there,besides Scream. I give this movie a thumbs up without a doubt.",Final Destination 3
236,Stevek-48,Definitely a second sequel,5,13 June 2007,"Some SPOILERS may follow, but they're not specific.It's not an appalling film by any means, but it is just a complete retread of all that's gone before, only with people nobody's heard of until now. That's a little harsh I know, because the actors all seem perfectly good at what they do.The modes of death have been played up, and there are some clever and disturbing shots. Like the previous films, it keeps you on your toes knowing exactly when the death is coming - lots of build up and red herrings.Overall, though, I found myself not caring at all about any of the characters. Everyone was a cypher and you can trace their roles right back to the first film. The tension isn't as good as it once was, because nothing's new - we all know something's going to happen and instead of being particularly frightening, it's more of a fun roller-coaster ride (pun intended). And please - what's with the characters who you know are going to die saying 'hey it missed me' or words to that effect? If you've never seen a horror film, this kind of shtick might be surprising, but anyone who's seen any slasher/stalker film will know what's coming.The filming is pretty good, especially in the big scenes, and the ending does manage a bit of a surprise - though again you might be ready for it.So it's not a bad film - just not in the least original, which is a shame.",Final Destination 3
237,nik963,Really good and inventive,8,9 January 2008,I thought this was an impressive conclusion to an excellent trilogy. It manages to have an underlying tension throughout which combines well with the horrific but funny in a black humour kind of way deaths. The worst death for me has to be solarium deaths for the two girls. The sequence of events that lead up to it are clever and the slow blackening of the skin and horror at their predicament was vintage horror. The main character was pretty irritating but the brilliantly entertaining deaths offset any weaknesses. The roller-coaster and the weights-room deaths were pretty brutal but all are original and have a freshness which can often be absent from horror movies nowadays. The ending is very good and concludes this trilogy with a bang.,Final Destination 3
238,cj_685,Great addition!,8,26 September 2006,"Yeah i have to say that the 'Final Destination' series is one of those things that just works but that could easily be repetitively awful! When I found out they were doing a prequel i honestly thought ""will this be where it all goes wrong?"" but i'm glad to say I don't think it did! 'Final Destination 3' has exactly the same format as the first two which you know is exactly what you're going to get, so that can't be argued about! The main issue is the circumstances that the characters die in, and i felt all of them were different and inventive, and in most cases very gory! The characters are cool, but then most of them don't stick around long enough for it to matter! One of the best things with these films has always been the special effects especially with the big dramatic deaths! This one is no exception and i was really pleased to see that used to its full potential yet again! This is a good film in its own right and more importantly is a good addition to 'Final Destination 1 & 2'! If you haven't got any of them then definitely get the box-set as it's a complete bargain!",Final Destination 3

They try to turn it into something it's not.However, I know most people are going to watch this to have a fun time. It delivers on that level.The gore is well done, the suspense grows on you and it's got a good beat. I'd just wish they had more characters (Ala more deaths) however, more characters would make it cheesy.It's fantastic if you don't pay attention to it that much. It runs under 2 hours, I believe.8/10 Also, the roller coaster incident is very well done. The ending is awkward but ends the way these movies do end.",Final Destination 3
240,jackstalwart-28556,Best cast but something is missing...,6,13 May 2020,"FD3 had the best cast ever in the series,like the lead was Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and she portrayed the best visionary. This movie was independent from the first two films and had its own style. Also it worked good actually,and the Tricentennial scene was such a mischief. Not to forget that deaths are better too. But more is not always better,so when deaths get the attention more,plot itself laid down a bit. But in overall and addition with the final twisted end,I really enjoye it and I can watch it several times more",Final Destination 3
241,gaston_,Go watch it,9,10 February 2006,"I've just got out of watching this movie. It has everything a good horror/terror movie should have: fast actions, short and shocking scenes and music in the right moment.It tells the story about a senior class students who are victims of a tragedy in a roller-coaster. Some of them survived, like Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and Kevin (Ryan Merriman). Together they find out curious facts about the people who did not, though should, have died in the roller-coaster accident.As the movie develops, it shows the mysterious ways in which death acts. The soundtrack and quick scenes make the spectator feel as if he were there, fighting death.The movie is not predictable, which is one of it's main characteristics, that makes it even more interesting. Sometimes you might have a clue of what's going to happen next, but most of the time you don't.I highly recommend this movie if you want to spend a quite scary and frightening moment watching a thriller. But be prepared to be scared.",Final Destination 3

It was great that the duo came back to do the final movie. Wong and Morgan did an awesome job. The writing was awesome and sometimes witty (EX. The hardware store). They knew where to push the serious and comedic levels in this movie. The beginning, like the rest, start off as a premonition. This one, let me tell you was the best. It grabbed on to you and didn't let you go. The characters were well developed and I actually didn't want some of them to die at all. The death scenes were really cool and fresh. Another thing that this movie succeeded in was capturing the essence of death, It's mysterious and it's a ""force"", it's out there. It caught the suspense and horror that the teens were feeling, uncertainty and the feeling that you can't control what will happen to you. If you're a Final Destination fan you should definitely see it! Even a horror-thriller fan should go see this. Definitely a must see. Go watch!",Final Destination 3
243,lordsaves777,"Nothing special,but still very enjoyable.",7,26 February 2006,"Final Destination 3 is about one girl that has a vision about her friends dying in a roller-coaster accident and tries to stop it,however,she could not save all of them,and those who were saved are threatened by the Death.No,this is nothing special,just what you have seen for the last 2 movies,and it's very disappointing.The director tried to add some photos to the plot just to give to the concept a breeze of fresh air,but it does n't help that much.Everything is very similar to the first 2 films,they try to save their lives,nobody believes them,and then they have to witness their dead over and over again until is their turn to die.Mary Elizabeth as Wendy and Ryan as Kevin,both of them do a great job looking scared and they had chemistry together,which made this movie more enjoyable,I am not an actor,but I still think they need to work more on their acting,but they did a good job.The events leading to the guys' dead is always very original,it seems like they spend more time planning how they are going to die than planning what new stuff they can bring to the plot line.Overall,is not a bad movie,the movie is really enjoyable,but nothing new,if you have n't seen any of the previous films you'll love this one,but if you have then you'll think just like me.",Final Destination 3

However, this third movie of the series is so much like the first movie that it feel like the director just take the storyline from the first movie and make it into another movie to squeeze more money from the moviegoers. There is really not much to say about the storyline. If you watched the first movie of the series, then you know the storyline of this movie. The things that are different are the characters (all the characters in the first movie are all death) and the ways that each ""escapees"" died. Judging on the success of this movie, they certainly will make more movies. But I would like to make a suggestion that they should add more creativity to the series.

Now the third one comes out and it's a disappointment, and since I have to fill out at least 10 line I'll pick it apart a little. Everyone in the film seemed to have a double, another secondary character that looks just like them, I know sisters should look alike but damn, I was confused every time the younger one hit the screen, none of the actors stood out.SPOILEROur main characters are idiots. There is a picture of a chick with a gun to her head and they have a hard time trying to interpret how she will die.END SPOILERThere also seemed to be a lot of useless setup in the deaths, I know there need to be some head fakes to keep tension up, but it was a bit over used for me.That all being said, the gore was OK, the only thing that kept me in the seat.",Final Destination 3

The original movie was a great new take on horror films. Unfortunately, this third installment is a huge disappointment. The only thing half-way good about it is the location of the amusement park. Besides that, there's nothing inventive or scary about it. The actors all suck, except for the lead girl Wendy, who is just okay. At least she's not as unlikable as the others. Unlike FD2, which was a good surprise, this was a really bad one. All the deaths are lame and uninteresting. I had high hopes after FD2 but this makes me not look forward to the upcoming 3D venture.

The first one is the best, the second one is okay and this one is the second best of the trilogy for two reasons, 1) The movie has an attractive girl for the lead role and the other reason is that the film makers apparently got some pretty good special effects because this movie is over the top violent. This movie has some pretty bloody scenes. I liked the movie but, I really don't like it when film makers make movies too violent because, who are they impressing by putting a lot of blood and gore in the movie?

It is a true Tour de force that you will never forget. If this doesn't put you off from going to alton towers I don't know what will.

251,kensdal,Frightening Thrill Ride From Beginning to End,10,11 February 2006,"I didn't go into FD3 with very high expectations. FD1 was great. FD 2 was awful. This movie could have went any direction for me...and gladly it went in the same direction as FD1. FD3 was awesome. It had a lot of suspense, a lot of gore, and some nudity is thrown in the mix as well.The story of FD3 is about a girl named Wendy who predicts a huge roller-coaster accident killing her peers, and herself. After making a scene while getting on the ride, Wendy, and a few of her peers, get caught up in the mix, and they all get kicked off the ride. The ride then crashes killing, a few of Wendy's peers, and others. After her friends start dieing, in horrific accidents, Wendy finds that the pictures she took of them at the carnival have clues, about how the survivors of the accident, will die. It is then up to Wendy, and her best friends boyfriend, Kevin, to warn the people about there upcoming deaths.This movie was really awesome. The effects weren't spectacular, but they were decent. This movie contains (spoilers) a tanning bed fire, a engine blade in the head, nails shot though the head, a flag pole through the chest, a head crushed by weights, a sign falling, and much more.FD3 stars a group of excellent actors and actresses which include Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ryan Merriman, Kris Lemche, Amanda Crew, Alexz Johnson, Chelan Simmons, Crystal Lowe, Texas Battle, Sam Easton, Maggie Ma, Gina Holden, and Jesse Moss.",Final Destination 3
252,brimblemeister,1 &2 were decent.....this was pants!!,1,18 February 2006,"I never usually give a film a 1 but this was fully deserving of it. FD 1&2 were OK had some nice parts, a bit corny but were OK, FD 3 was just simply awful! It was simply an attempt to put as many gruesome deaths in one film without concentrating on the plot which gets somewhat lost! Of course if you love deaths that end in 'splat' and sheer gruesomeness you may like this but to me it just seems a pointless edition to the other respectable Final Destinations. Some of the CGI is shocking looks like a PS2 game, and when i look at it on DVD I'm sure I'm going to see a lot of flaws in the smoothness because I'm sure I spotted real jumps in CGI when things were falling or about to 'splat' someone! The acting is more wooden than Keanu Reeves' shed and the directing & writing is high school stuff. Me and my friends who went were laughing at how bad it really was and asking if there was a real point to the story. Yes we know the death has a pattern idea, but this in the first 2 is backed up with some decent plots and even character depth. FD 3 is just simply shocking and contains no substance what so ever. AVOID at all costs!! a serious disappointment in my books with not even a positive to take from it! Take your £5 down the casino you will get more enjoyment losing it that way",Final Destination 3
253,nsbrwttt,Predictable but entertaining.,4,13 February 2006,"I can't say that I didn't like each of the films, they all had a little bit gore, couple of bits to shock you and guessing games to what the next death would be, especially the last film with the photos as clues.From the jump it was obvious the acting was mediocre to bad. But I really didn't mind, as I didn't expect it. Straight away I picked out who was going to die and I was right. Two of the characters where so annoying that I really didn't mind watching them die, even though their deaths were harsh and bloody painful, closed casket style.I think this films story line of 'cheating death' will be used over and over with sequels, prequels and carbon copy's until we get bored of it, unless you already are. I actually went to the cinema to watch this one unlike the first two, which I just waited for them to be released. I'll probably even end up buying them when they are going cheap just for a little bit of slow motion on the DVD.If you like the others you will like this, better than the second and about the same as the first.

As a rule, things usually get worse w/ the more sequels that get released. Not so here.After FD2, I thought this franchise was destined to either fizzle out or end up as an endless stream of straight-to-video crap releases like 'Son of Final Destination', 'Final Destination: the Revenge' and such (ala 'Children of the Corn').The deaths were creative AND the plot was actually worth paying attention to (unlike, FD2 where it just seemed almost like horror porn: a bunch of crappy dialogue scenes thrown in between the death 'money shots'.) The 'Choose Their Fate' option on the DVD didn't seem to really add that much to the whole experience -- maybe if I watched it a few more times, it would, but that's not time I'm willing to put in.Final Destination 3: Better than being kicked in the head or watching paint dry.",Final Destination 3
255,Boanthrope,Sequelitis at its worst.,5,30 July 2006,"Let me start by saying that as pure popcorn fodder there's enough action and gore to keep your average Joe entertained for 90 minutes - hence my score of 5/10.However... this movie epitomises what usually goes wrong with horror movie franchises. The body count and gore goes up, the tension and characterisation plummets.For all its flaws, FD1 at least had suspense. The characters being portrayed were genuinely disturbed by the air disaster events and premonition. There were tensions between them. There was an unfolding plot as the characters realised what was happening, became more and more afraid, and tried to figure out how to survive.By the time FD3 comes along, the premise is exactly the same but we just cut straight to the death scenes. Apart from the lead pair, no-one seems in the least bit shook-up about the roller-coaster accident or the spooky premonition. It's not even clear which characters DID survive the accident. Barely any of the 'characters' have more than a few lines. The film has an excruciatingly basic structure...Several people survive accident after premonition, as per FD1 & FD2.Kevin relates events of FD1 Wendy.Wendy: ""Hmm, these photos seem odd. I believe you.""Kevin/Wendy to someone: ""Hey, we think you're gonna die soon.""Virtual anonymous character I think I saw somewhere in the opening sequence: ""You're crazy. Ha! Ha!""Above character dies horribly but amusingly after some bizarre, convoluted accident.Kevin/Wendy: ""Look we were right. Now YOU'RE gonna die!""Next anonymous character: ""Despite the above events, I'm still in a jovial mood and I just don't believe you or care. Ha, ha!""Character dies horribly.Kevin/Wendy: ""Come on, you've got admit this is spooky, and you're next!""Next anonymous character: ""Don't be stupid. In fact, I'm not even sure I've been in the film up to this point. Chuckle, chuckle, you kids!""Character dies horribly, as augured by the images in the opening credits (as per FD1 and FD2).... etc. etc.OK, I've oversimplified things there, but you get my point. The characters' attitudes were completely unbelievable. There is no emotional aftermath of any of the deaths. These kids should be freaked out - especially after the first bizarre deaths. Instead this plays out more like a comedy, which I guess was the director's intention, but just doesn't really work for me.FD1 was decent and original horror flick. Its tongue was slightly in its cheek, but this didn't detract from the suspense. It even had room for subplot whereby it was suggested the clairvoyant kid was CAUSING these deaths somehow. 7/10.FD2 signalled the subsequent direction of the series, with the emphasis on the elaborate death scenes and humour, but still had enough plot and character tension to make it credible. 6/10.FD3 however, throws plot structure and suspense out of the window in favour of humour and extravagant gore. 5/10.As evidenced by the IMDb ratings and many of the comments on here, a lot of people seem to think this is a good thing, but it just doesn't do anything for me I'm afraid. Just about entertaining, but nothing more.",Final Destination 3
256,guse23,The Goods and the Bads.,7,15 February 2006,"At first when I heard about this sequel I was a little eh about it. Similar plot, roller coaster. How straight to video can this get? And in some ways this movie had a lot of straight to video qualities. But in a others it didn't.Let's begin with the GOOD: I was glad to see the this Final Destination film continued with the tradition of having a lead actor who wasn't all well-known but had great talent. This actor being Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Alongside her there is Ryan Merriman, who I must admit I am tired of, BUT must admit he did a great job. I liked how they they wrote his character not trying to create a love interest but a friend with a connection. Actually I felt the entire cast did a great job. Though for some it didn't take much with the character they had.Almost immediately you're thrown into death's grasp as the lead Wendy walks the grounds, taking photos for yearbook, seeing death's signs all around the carnival which is hosting the school's grad nite.As soon as the characters step past the bars into the ride's line you could feel the tension and are immediately hooked. Whether it's the fear of roller coasters or whether you know what's to come the tension's there. And so begins the disaster we know all know and love. Which was fast and entertaining and also with what little time it had you saw how each character, whether or not they were close, cared for the welfare of the others. And then it turned out to be a vision and so on.THE BAD: The issue, as it usually is, was in the writing. Beginning with who survived the ride. We have the lead, the male sidekick, two ""dark"" teens(one Alexz Johnson who I enjoyed), two valley girls, the big headed jock, a perverted loser who graduated two years prior, and two others. Seeing the issue here? Luckily the stupid/ paper characters were the first to go. Unfortunately as soon as they died the really creative deaths did as well. Once we reached the film's end it seemed that they weren't really putting as much into the finale as they should have. It either felt like they had nothing else to really add or more probably they were trying to keep the movie at a certain length, so not to drag, and were so busy cramming death after death into it that they ran out of space for good ending.Not to dis these killings because they were actually quite good and gory. I actually ended up feeling for the characters that i didn't even care for. But that's all this movie was. Back to back murders with no real story. Granted this movie was trying to relive the formula and outline of the original so more story would've probably made it a repeat. But this honestly had potential to be much greater of a movie.It was also flawed (spoilage-->)in the idea that the characters could read online that ""death would skip you if you interfered"" but there was nothing about how death was a never ending cycle. That idea worked well with part 1 because we as the audience didn't know it. So we were all surprised. But for this sequel to continue that thought and half these characters continuing on thinking it would end soon when we've all known from the past 6 years it wouldn't made this movie weaker. And so we are led to a finale (like part one) where they survive and it's years later and death returns unexpectedly. The ending goes down a predictable route then does a sudden twist. Which at first is cheesy but then makes it end interestingly.So although this movie is highly flawed. I did like it. I liked the cast, it was a fun ""roller coaster"" trip, it was gory, had great music, and even some interesting new ideas (involving the photos Wendy took). Granted i'm still debating whether I should have given it a 6.5 I do recommend this movie especially if you enjoyed the first two films.",Final Destination 3
257,GloriaT,Fatal Action Won't Die!,5,22 February 2006,"""Final Destination 3"" may be a film with TV production values, but it has cult aspirations, and even lives up to them spottily. Sadly, for fans of Scythe-Shoulderer schlock, some of the scenes that build up to destruction and death are oddly without excruciation, not to mention too complicated for even Rube Goldberg. But as the film unspools, it manages to pick up a beat good enough to dance to -- with the suspension of one's disbelief as a partner.""FD3"" begins with Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) celebrating with members of her graduating high school class at an amusement park. Sitting in a roller coaster waiting for the ride to begin, she has an intense vision of disaster, causing her to panic. She takes herself off the ride before it starts and is led away---along with some friends who disembarked to calm her---by an uncaring adult who accuses her of being on drugs. Not so, Mister. Wendy's vision soon turns real and many witness the deadly horror. Among the victims are Wendy's best friend and her boyfriend.The seven grads who escaped ""roller coaster death"" thanks to Wendy's clairvoyance are living on borrowed time, as Wendy discovers, and are scheduled to die in the order they originally boarded the ill-fated ride, as if Death were methodically rectifying the last-second screw-up caused by Wendy's vision. Digital photos from the night at the amusement park hold clues to the ""do-over"" deaths of the kids who got away. Our mission, should we decide to watch this movie, is to try to figure out the means Death will use to put its books in order, and exactly when the make-up mortality will take place.On one level, Wendy spends the rest of the film trying to save her friends. On another level, she is trying to recapture a happier past by solving the mystery that left her boyfriend dead and her own life a psychotic ruin. Like the best private eyes in our pop culture, she is dismissed by the police. Wendy must rely on her deductive reasoning to attempt to divine the future, something she had been able to predict at the amusement park via involuntary intuition.These different levels are linked by feelings of guilt -- she feels responsible; selfishness -- she begins to care more about solving this mystery than the lives it claims; and gradually by her own impending doom, which forces out all other considerations.Wendy is a brooding heroine, who graduated high school only to be thrown violently into that adult world from which her storybook namesake fled on the coattails of Peter Pan.Death, says Ian (Kris Lemche) in ""FD3,"" is an inexorable force. Others begin to believe Death works according to a sick plan. The film itself depicts our physical demise as the haphazard result of the aleatory nature of our lives, a dimension we are mostly blind to because of our ego-based point of view.Director James Wong actually succeeds in making it fun to tag along with Wendy as she tries to save her friends, deal with her own guilt and save herself Along the way, two shallow girls pursuing the consumer ideal of beauty suffer a gruesome, painful end. The demise of these ""hotties"" is not without its irony. We also see the hotheaded football star, played by Texas Battle, strengthening every muscle but the one between his ears. Could this omission become a vulnerability? Disturbed rebel Ian spouts science, but believes in nothing. And there is no avoiding Frankie (Sam Easton), a legend in his own groin, and too full of himself to attract any fans, except perhaps one.There is plenty of gore and spatter, but surprisingly little philosophizing about the meaning of life. Perhaps that's the key to the success of ""Final Destination 3."" Oddly, some dialog in the script, penned by Wong with experienced TV screenwriter Glen Morgan, belies a confused understanding of colloquial American Englsih. For instance, when Wendy hangs back during a funeral, preferring to stand apart from the gathered mourners, fellow survivor Kevin (Ryan Merriman) asks her why she is in the ""nose-bleeds."" He uses it as a synonym for ""far away,"" but the term derives its meaning from the height of the seats furthest away from the playing field (especially at a vintage stadium like the one in the Bronx), an altitude high enough to cause a nose bleed. Since there is no comparable landscaping in evidence at the cemetery, this usage makes no sense.At the same funeral, Easton's tasty character claims he regrets having treated women as ""fun bags,"" a jocular slang that first appeared in print 40 years ago this month (in Playboy, where else). Still, this derogatory term obviously doesn't refer to the female of the species, but rather only to her most commonly fixated upon secondary sexual characteristics.While the film provides laughs for the depraved, it also educates. We learn there are deadly hazards all around us, from ""not so fast food"" drive-thrus to litterbugs on a sugar high. ""FD 3"" isn't so much a real movie as a kind of running visual gag in the form of a movie, and as such holds your interest, gets you worrying 'bout Wendy and, despite a poorly staged climax, is actually kind of fun.",Final Destination 3
258,preppyboy90,Whatever,7,12 March 2006,"FINAL DESTINATION 3 has been called the best movie from all 3, I beg to differ in so many senses.THINGS THEY COULD AND SHOULD HAVE CHANGED: -The movie IMMEDIATELY starts with the main character, Wendy Christensen having weird feelings about the roller-coaster and the pictures she takes.-She takes one picture and a second after she looks at it and thinks something is wrong with the picture (Most of us don't even look at the pictures like that, is just a picture). -*Ridiculous stuff* An airflow happens and Wendy and the other main character, Kevin Fischer, feel that something is going to happen (IS JUST AN AIRFLOW!!! Nobody has bad feelings from it!)-The clues on the pictures are EXTREMELY exaggerated and hidden to know, you can't think of any clues if you really see it. (Take one of your friends, look at everything and you could come up with thousands of clues in that case)-Most of the deaths are way too elaborated, example: The tanning bed scene.-There are too many characters to be killed (Do I really need to bring up that Asian girl Perry???...Seriosuly, why is she in the movie???) and so, you only know of them on their death scene, that's the only function they have, examples: Julie, Ashley, Ashlynn, PERRY! (Julie didn't have relevance until the end of the film)-The movie's ONLY strong point: The deaths, not the way the characters should defeat death (Think of FINAL DESTINATION 2)THE BRIGHTSIDE: -The use of visual effects and a lot more impressive deaths (Some of them too disturbing if you ask me)-Hey, they had Alexz Johnson and Chelan Simmons!-The unexpected ending-The use of the pictures as clues was a really good idea.I think that the only reason you would want to watch FINAL DESTINATION 3 is because of the deaths, not the movie itself, the resolution and develop of it is pretty much as the first FINAL DESTINATION. Go and watch the movie if you liked the previous two AND if you like gore.",Final Destination 3
259,Fezz_Head,Awesome.,9,11 March 2006,"This in my opinion,SMOKES the other 2 movies by so much.More gore,violence,cursing,and even a little nudity.The deaths in this one were much more creative.The director thought about the ways to die.The suspense will keep going and then when you think they are going to die,they don't.And then Splat!The storyline rocked and it featured a new addition to the Final Destination series.Some of the deaths were kind of like yeah,she's gonna get this through that,so minus 1 for that.If you loved the first two,you must buy this one.Note:You cannot see this movie without going ""Oh,SICK!""",Final Destination 3
260,jayboutilier,This just in...Final destination 3 is a rehash of the first movie and a bad one at that,1,1 March 2006,"I remember when the first Final destination came out, it was original and pretty damn cool. Then the second one came out, it was wicked, ten times better and better deaths and even a conclusive ending... then came word of a 3rd final destination, i couldn't wait to see it, but when i did, I wish I had't...it was a waste of time. now, I don't expect too much from this kind of movie, however, I'd like to see more than a cut down almost gore less remake of the first movie. whoever said this movie had cool deaths and good gore to me was lying. I've seen way better, The movie is pretty much a tired excuse for lame gore. there was absolutely nothing else to this, main character rushes to save the next victim and watches them die somehow. Now I might have been able to accept those flaws if the ending wasn't so utterly pointless and stupid. pretty much the ending tells you ""you just wasted your money, because if you can't escape death, you won't"", thus meaning you already knows what happens to every character that was suppose to die.... that's right they die. this movie is just about the details of their deaths and they're not the greatest details either... This movie did not need to be made, rent the first two instead, then watch the first one again but fast forward all the character development scenes and the cop scenes and the scenes in the cemetery..in fact just watch the premonition scene then watch the deaths.... that's equivalent of final destination 3, oh and add your own crappy ending.",Final Destination 3
261,pyramidhead84,horrid at best,1,9 March 2007,"I loved Final Destination and Final Destination 2. Both films were creative, suspenseful and unique. The plots were simple, but catchy. The suspense was heart-wrenching, and the gore was practical and horrifying. This movie, however is a complete failure on all these counts. Final Destination 3 makes little to no attempt at an actual plot line, aside from the basic 'death is stalking you' theme from the previous movies. The main characters seem to have no real agenda and just exchange weak banter as they try and convince their friends that something bad is going to happen to them.The characters themselves are all tired rehashed stereotypes from modern Anytown, USA. None of which bothered to make any kind of connection with the audience before getting quickly and unimaginatively wiped out. For the previous films, I was on the edge of my seat, heart pounding, nearly sweating awaiting the next terrible tragedy to occur, cheering on my favorite characters and sighing with relief when they just barely made it out of danger. For the duration of this film, I was mostly sighing in boredom and biting my tongue as more useless dialog washed over the audience during scene after scene of the wind blowing ominously.The deaths themselves weren't even done well enough to warrant bumping up the rating on this movie. Once again, in the previous films, each death was a masterpiece of suspense, gore, and imagination. This movie rushed through the main opening death scene, quickly shuffled off the easiest targets, and made absolutely no attempt at obscuring exactly how each person would die. I was able to guess about half of them, and the other half were so far fetched that it really knocked down the terrifying realism the other movies had portrayed so well.If you absolutely must see all three in the trilogy, by all means, rent Final Destination 3, but do not expect the same cinematic masterpieces the other two will have you hoping for.",Final Destination 3
262,Hollie_H,Cut above the previous 2,10,11 April 2007,I personally loved this movie and this has been my favourite in the franchise so far. However everyone has a different frame of mind some people thought the 1st & 2nd movie were better it just depends on what you are like. It has the same storyline as the previous 2 movies but the deaths are more exhilarating and has a higher gore rating. The deaths are original and most are deaths you wont have seen in other movies. There is always a major accident at the start of the movie as you will know the 1st one was a plane crash the 2nd a highway crash and this one a roller-coaster crash. I personally preferred the roller-coaster crash out of the three the sequence is a lot longer than usual and exciting. The movie has a higher emotional rate than the previous and Wendy (Mary Elisabeth Winsted) brings a lot of emotion to the role and takes it up a notch. The parts are all well acted some characters get on your nerves but their is a wide variety of characters so their should be someone everyone can relate to. Overall i would recommend seeing this movie if you are a fan of the previous movies as this was a good addition to the franchise.,Final Destination 3

The movie was really awesome a great trilogy everything about the movie was my favorite, a great cast, the whole cast really do a great role on portraying their characters. The director has a great directing sense, i heard about the ending where the 3 main characters survived in the end and then end credits, I'm glad that they changed the ending on where the main characters died instead, that made the movie even more better, and face it no one wants to see that 3 characters survived in the end, everyone in the final destination movies had to die eventually even the main characters.Well anyways I love seeing a great ending and of course a great beginning of a movie too.

264,filmchap,Remember the board game Mousetrap?,1,17 November 2006,"Mousetrap, for those to young to remember... (basically the target audience of this Hollywood drivel) was a game in which you set a trap in motion to capture the mouse. A sort of Domino effect of plastic gadgets that once set in motion would trigger the trap to capture the mouse. Well here it is on the big screen, the two main differences being the plastic gadgets have been replaced by million $$$ CGI and ludicrous set pieces, and the mouse replaced by American teenage actors who I couldn't give a damn about. Simply put, utter drivel from the start to the finish. Basically Moutsetrap 3... die little mousey. This sums up Hollywood horror today, a chain of endless Tish that once set in motion has never ended. Just wish they could bag the mouse and move onto something of substance. The Hollywood studio system was once like a roller-coaster itself. But life imitating art with a film like Final Destination 3, proves for sure, that there ride is definitely over!",Final Destination 3
265,squire87,Let's hope this bad sequel puts an end to this series once and for all,1,7 February 2006,"Wow. This movie was horrible. Bad dialog, bad acting, bad characters and, worst of all, BAD effects. Man, you'd think the effects budget for this film was $1.98. They were so bad and fakey looking that it took me right out of the movie. The effects, coupled with poor editing, pretty much made the presentation sloppy and disorienting. The opening scene with the roller-coaster was a completely disastrous let down. Honestly, I could go on and on, but what would be the point.The only thing I'd like to add is that for some reason the writers and/or director felt the need to poke at modern political figures and events as often as possible throughout the film. Why? No idea. It was Osama this and Saddam that. Very out of place. But, perhaps the worst of all was using the 9/11 tragedy as a flimsy gimmick to reinforce a plot device. It was, to say the least, in very poor taste. Avoid this film.",Final Destination 3
266,the_mad-scientist,you can become death (well on DVD anyway),6,4 August 2006,"Well there had to be a third movies, its to be expected from teen flicks. like the other two, you know where this is going, but like a roller-coaster just enjoy the ride.however with the DVD release, you can decide what happens, there is an option to choose theatrical version, or the version where you decide the outcome and decide their fate. You don't get to say live or die, but subtle things that may change the outcome, in line with the premise for the film.It is a refreshing change for a DVD to actually use the functionality built into the system.As for the movie, others have reviewed it, so read all their comments. this is purely for those of you who like to play, so enjoy and see what the film does.",Final Destination 3
267,goofnut569,"Visceral, Gritty, and WOW they just keep getting better!",8,5 March 2006,"I saw the first two FD movies out of sequence. That may be why my opinion of FD2 is what it is in comparison to the first film. The second one was much better than the first and the tradition continues here. It seemed that the first two were trying to make some of the deaths almost comical in a sick way. This installment certainly turned away from that. Everything about FD3 was great, even the acting. However, the script called for a few too many stereotypes which is why this film doesn't deserve a '10' score. The conversations were a bit deeper and made some since this time around, all stereotypes aside, and you actually learned a bit about the characters beyond their simple teen exoskeletons. The accidents were very realistic and slightly more plausible than the those in the previous Final Destinations. Several of them are severely intense and disturbing. The personification of death as an all consuming force continues. The presence of death is symbolized by wind this time around whereas it was a shadow in the first and cold in the second. Hopefully these actors and actresses will go on to greater things, and hopefully James Wong will decide to bring even more of our worst fears and nightmares to life in another Final Destination film. The surprise ending to this film opens the door for a brilliant sequel, which will hopefully come about and continue the tradition of gritty, visceral, and possibly slightly intelligent horror.",Final Destination 3
268,schalazeal-00917,Worthy! Believable acting.. like the play of events..,8,4 December 2015,"I must say this is better than I originally thought! I thought this is gonna be more cliché. On the other hand, the string of events were played out well and in a very Final Destination feel. You really have to appreciate the film for what it is bec. if you'll think it's just plain RIDICULOUS or IMPOSSIBLE, it's not Final Destination! Mary Winstead (Wendy) is also pretty!! I like her eyes and face! I just gotta point that out bec. I find her attractive even tho I'm a girl.. XD must be just admiring but nothing else!! XD The acting is also believable!! NOT THE BEST but way better than other actors! I was actually observing Wendy and Kevin in this movie and the emotions and the FEEL was there! Not the best but believable.. I also noticed the orchestra playing in the background giving it like a classical feel.. I imagine that old movies also have unreal or very dramatic or sudden play of events like in this film.. I think it also got an inspiration from the oldies.. or did it?? Anyway, it was a good movie! Netflix (or our net/my laptop) kept on lagging so I had to pause a lot of times also bec. of pixelated moments but I still enjoyed it and got myself into the movie thoroughly! Not the best movie, but for how it's supposed to work out.. it did a very good job! It's not at all that predictable like how I imagined it to be! :) Also, I like some of the comedic scenes like how that perv was saying at Ashley and the other popular girl's funeral that he was the cause of their death coz of the pressure of looking good! Some of the lines of the characters about to die were a little cheesy and repetitive but I appreciate the part where Ian Mckinley was talking about Law of Newton and such.. Maybe I have yet to expand my movie list but I appreciated this more!",Final Destination 3

I just got back from the cinema and I was gripped throughout the movie. The first movie was a breath of fresh air in an already overcrowded genre, so it was hard to believe that a sequel could be pulled off, but they did with the second movie.So when I hear-ed that a third one was due for release I couldn't wait to get down the odeon to see it.The film wasn't too long and every scene was slick and well put together making the audience guessing the outcome of another gruesome death but shocking us all with the actual death, it was amazing!Bring on No4!",Final Destination 3

Though it's not as interactive has a game, you'll find this little option very amusing.Definitely a good rent but that's it.The thing is that you can't stop thinking this is the third Final Destination and this is the only way they would improve.

271,jamesbuc,accidents accidents accidents...,7,11 January 2007,"Yes the series that has made us worried of quickly arriving buses and runaway elevators has returned this time seemingly to try and make us scared (this time) of Roller Coasters, Tanning beds and Weight sets among other things.And Boy do they try with gusto.First of all in the film is the plot, this time we focus on young heroine Wendy (Played by actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who was last seen in the film 'Sky High') and her set of friends. After some picture taking of various people she gets onto a large roller-coaster. Then the first accident happens when the roller-coaster de-rails and, in a rather impressive and terrifying way, crashes, killing everybody on it. Wendy suddenly wakes up and freaks out resulting in her, her best friend's boyfriend Kevin (Played by Ryan Merriman), the two Goths Ian (Kris Lemech) and Erin (Alexz Johnson), the stereotypical American Jock (Texas Battle), the pervy Frankie (Sam Easton) two mystery people and the two also stereotypical bitches Ashley (Chelan Simmons) and Ashlyn (Cystal Lowe). However the roller-coaster still rolls away and crashes killing the people still on.What happens next is a series of slideshow deaths with inanimate objects attempting to do as much gory impaling, crushing, decapitating and burning as possible. Wendy, being the visionary and last on the list. Races around the whole film attempting to halt the deaths using various supposed clues from pictures she took while at the funfair.Plotwise the film is almost, at the best of times, paper-thin. The deaths however are what raises the film from the usual horror staple. These deaths are gruesome, shocking, brutal and (in some ways) just plain nasty. However because of also the annoying-ness of the various teenagers this seems okay. There are only about three characters that save this movie. One being Wendy. Winstead plays the character well and is almost prize-worthy during some of the more dramatic moments with Kevin, Ian or her sister Julie. Also Ian (Lemech) practially steals the spotlight whenever he is on screen with his anger and fury at the events that follow.Overall the movie is quite a good flick. Various moments of black humour seep in and if there is a Final destination 4 I wouldn't mind seeing more it. Next time however it would be nice to see character development and more of a meaty plot.",Final Destination 3

Afterwards the survivors are stalked by the Grim Reaper and killed in Rube Goldberg-like accidents.the deaths in this movie are particularly gruesome. In one case 2 girls are graphically burned alive in a tanning salon.This type of film might work as a black comedy, but the story is deadly serious,and there is no humor to speak of.Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fairly good as the guilt stricken prophet,but the rest of the cast makes no impression.",Final Destination 3

So therefore I can only blame myself, I had no right to waste my time and my money on this garbage.I would like to give a detailed analysis of just how bad this movie truly was but I can't bear to subject myself to reliving it out. Therefore I will sum it up without going into detail.The acting was bad, the dialog cheesy. All the characters were cliché Slasher movie types. There was not a bit of compassion and care in any of them, SO it prohibited me to feel any for them when they died.Another problem was that the movie was not suspenseful at all. There were no twists, no truly frightening moments. It didn't chill me like the other two did.I would go on but the very thought of having to rehash this poor excuse for a film makes me shudder. So in closing if you are looking for a cheap excuse for a film with breasts and gore-filled, over-the-top deaths, then this is your movie. But if you are looking for an intelligent, thought provoking movie with character development then stay far FAR away from this film.One out of ten.",Final Destination 3
274,rizzojr,Enough Already,1,16 February 2007,"At least the first installment of this series was original. Unfortunately, the unique concept that propelled the first movie to good reviews has been played out in the third (and hopefully final) movie of the Final Destination franchise.In FD3, Wendy Christensen has a horrifying premonition of a derailing roller coaster that she is about to ride. As a result, she and several others manage to escape from the ride just before her vision comes to fruition. While coming to grips with the horrible accident, Wendy and Kevin, a fellow survivor, discover that the other survivors are dying in the same order that they would have died had they stayed on the coaster. Photographs she took before the accident offer Wendy clues as to how each person will eventually die. As person after person dies, Wendy and Kevin race against time trying to decipher how the next individual in line will be killed. As they rush to warn the next unlucky soul, they are often met with skepticism and ridicule, only to be proved right by witnessing that person's gruesome demise. In the end, only three of the seven initial survivors are still standing. That is until five months later, when, by chance, they meet on a subway train and Wendy has another vision.The problem with Final Destination 3 is the tired premise upon which it is built. For everything the Scream movies did right, such as playing on itself, the Final Destination trilogy does wrong. It is basically the same movie as the first two with different death scenes.Bottom line... the script is boring, the acting is ordinary, and the once amusing deaths are becoming stale.",Final Destination 3

If you didn't, why are you reading this review? Much better than the inferior second film. Good to see the original director and producer back on board. If you judge these by the gruesomeness and outrageousness of the deaths (what else would you judge them on, plot?), than this may in fact be the best of the three. And surprisingly enough, the acting is passable for a film of this ilk. Not a lot of unintentional laughter at the dialog (but plenty of laughter and screams during the death scenes)Right on par with the first one. Tanning booths, nail guns, weight machines, oh my!

While not a thriller nor a gruesome tail like Saw or Hostel, FD3 manages to keep the story moving, the plot complex (enough), and the gore shocking enough to keep the movie enjoyable. The storyline won't win any awards, but the acting is more than adequate (luckily all the actors have the same level and there's isn't a particular sore thumb) and most of the cheesy plot twists have been eliminated. This won't keep you scratching your head (unless you're reminded of several of the ""eliminations"") but it will keep your attention for 90 minutes. The only downside to the film is that it uses the flashback / vision concept once too many and it does use a 9/11 story that could have well been cut.",Final Destination 3

The worst part of the movie is the beginning and the whole roller-coaster accident, the CGI was so obvious and not real good. The first death scene was lacking any imagination and not particularly gory so it was a let down, but after that it took it up a couple notches and really won me over!! Let's face the facts we go see these types of movies for the gore factor! These types of movies aren't scary so the gore better be good and this one was! If you go in expecting great gore below average acting and a so-so story line then you won't be disappointed! I loved it for what it is supposed to be!

278,Spike-in-Berlin,Why should I give a damn...,1,29 February 2012,"The original Final Destination was something new in the sub-genre of the ""Teeny slasher""-horror movie. It involved some pretty scary and nailbiting scenes, the worst plane crash scene in a movie EVER (enough to induce fear of flying) and an interesting plot. However, already in the first movie, in the last about 20 minutes, it began to lose it's pace. And the entire sequels only continued the downfall.In Final Destination III finally the entire franchise becomes absolutely ridiculous. I don't know why the screenplay writers finally considered it a good idea to KILL THEM ALL! Already the second movie killed the two survivors of the first and in the third NO ONE survives. So why should the audience give a damn about the entire movie? Why should we want to watch a movie when we know that there is absolutely no way that ANY person originally planned to be killed in the disaster. Those who survive ""their"" movie are killed of-screen in the following one.Is there a way, honestly, to kill the entire franchise, at least to an audience that cares about plot, characters etc? The only question that remains in this and the following sequels is ""how will they die"". And there we come to the second aspect of the decline of the Final Destination franchise. Absolutely unbelievable, absurd, increasingly unrealistic dead scenes. A tubular roller-coaster that malfunctions because of a camcorder of the tube? A tanning bad that can by accident turn hot enough to burn peoples skin in seconds?After Final Destination I know, that the increasingly and uninteresting shallow characters will all die, if not in this movie in the next one, and they can do absolutely nothing about it.

Is your cell phone going to work in an emergency or will your battery go dead? The face of death, it waits, it waits all the time and when your not looking it grabs you. Can you really outsmart death? Remember the last time you rode on a roller coaster? The intense speed as you were glued to the seat. You hope no one vomits in front of you, because you will eat their breakfast! Yum, was that lucky charms? The fast turns that made you almost vomit a hot dog and cotton candy.

I enjoyed both of the previous movies, so I knew what to expect. Perhaps that was the problem, it was pretty much more of the same. Kills were definitely more gory, and there was some suspense in how exactly they were going to die, but you still knew it was coming. In that sense, I differ from the previous reviewers who say this was a return to form for the series. I think having seen them all, I'd say it was a blend of the two, with the deaths being more amusing than anything else.I do agree that the opening death sequence was well done, and overall still enjoyed the movie. If it's a movie you want to go see, by all means I think it was fun and enjoyable. The big screen probably enhances the experience a little bit as well.",Final Destination 3

282,allgood_2000,Basically an excuse to splatter copious amounts of gore all over the place,5,17 February 2006,"Final Destination was great suspense/thriller movie with an interesting concept. Final Destination 2 was a good sequel because it expanded on the concepts of the original and was not just a repeat of the first. When I heard the writers of the first Final Destination were returning for Final Destination 3, I was expecting it to be a good movie that would delve deeper into the concepts of the first two and tie up all the loose ends. I was sorely disappointed. Final Destination 3 seemed like more of a remake than a sequel. It brought nothing new to the table, it had no returning characters, and it had virtually no connection to the first two. The only acknowledgement the first two movies receive is about ten seconds of characters discussing news articles they had found.The writers apparently expect viewers to be familiar with the concept, as there is little explanation of death having a design and how that design can be cheated. There is little character development, so you don't really care whether or not the characters live or die. This movie is full of plot holes and discrepancies. I had a hard time believing that this installment was written by the writers of the first one. The first one was in-depth and well thought out, while the script for this one seemed like it was thrown together in an hour by a drunken fifteen-year-old. Final Destination 3 is basically just a 90-minute excuse to splatter copious amounts of blood and guts all over the place.The first two Final Destination movies are far superior in terms of plot, originality, character development, and plausibility (and that's saying something). The death sequences in the first movie are plausible for the most part. Some of the deaths in the second movie are over-the-top and somewhat cheesy, but still entertaining. The death sequences in the third one are completely off-the-wall scenarios. If you haven't seen the first two Final Destination movies and you are thinking about seeing Final Destination 3, I would strongly suggest watching the first two instead.",Final Destination 3
283,piggypiggy,"Very disappointed, second film was far better.",5,15 February 2006,"I only give the 5 points for the particularly gory and lengthy deaths of the two girls on the tanning beds. That was the only fairly original and unusual death throughout the film, although I think the worst one was at the drive-thru, ugh, now that was really sick!! (in a good way) I knew I would probably like the third instalment of the Final Destination franchise if only this film surpassed the originality of the first two. Final Destination 2 was especially gory and the special effects were fantastic; all the deaths were surprising, new and inventive. The story itself built upon the first film which I liked, and had a much more eerie and supernatural feel to it. The idea of predestination and a 'grand plan' is nothing new, but the way it plays out is what makes the movie different from the first film. The ending was truly unique and not predictable at all, and the twists and turns were unusual and clever. I was particularly freaked out by the crematorium guy (my recollection of the film is vague), and the creepy way he spoke about death and plucked the piercing from the corpse, ewww. Little scenes like that were enough for me to rate this sequel one of the best horror flicks i've ever seen; its the attention to detail in FD2 that won me over. And the radio tuning into songs such as Highway to Hell - genius.However in this sequel the story was unoriginal, predictable and the deaths were just lame. After using the squishing head/body thing in the previous film I felt it unnecessary to reuse it not once, not twice, but THREE times in this movie! (The weight lifting guy, and and the girl and boy on the train). There was not detail there, only cheap CGI and pathetic camera angles so as to blur the image to the point where it just looked fake. The roller coaster idea was surely not thought-out at all, it must've just been a case of ""oh, what scenario can i devise whereby a large number of high school kids might get killed in one go?"".All in all I would advise people to avoid tarnishing the good reputation of Final Destination 2 by not watching this awful tacky made-for-profit sequel.",Final Destination 3
284,sari_tb,Pretty bad...,2,20 August 2006,"Guys, this is getting old. How many more movies do we need about the same subject? The idea of the story was interesting, and why the first one was pretty good, but when it has been done 3 times (getting more??), you know it's just done. When the whole point of the movie is, that one person sees when the people he/she knows, are going to die, and how they die. First nobody believes him/her, but after lets say a couple of deaths, they believe and start escaping the death (meaning escaping the situations where they most likely would die). But still the result is the same; everybody dies who were ""suppose"" to die in the first place. The effects were actually pretty good, and that's why I gave 2 stars, not 1 star what the s",Final Destination 3
285,Murphy_87,Could Have Been The Best......... But Wasn't,6,11 February 2006,"I think the main problem I had with this film is that I expected too much from it and was really excited about watching it. OK don't get me wrong if you love the first two like me you will love this one, and you'll walk out after with a smile on your face, as I did but after a while I felt cheated. I thought this could have been the best but in my opinion it was the weakest.There was some problems with this film, for starters where was the rest of the film, I know its around 90mins but it seemed like it was just over an hour, an extra 20 minutes wouldn't have hurt. Second I think the writers needed to bring something new into the plot, as half way through the film,the supernatural element of death finding them just wasn't there because you are just more interested in seeing how everyone dies. That why the original is the best, because it is actually scary in my opinion, but FD2 was a great follow up. This is probably the most gory one out of the three and some of the deaths were quite original, but everyone in the audience laughed when someone died lol I think one or two of the deaths was far fetched in the lead up to it.The roller-coaster bit was up to scratch in terms of effects and I didn't think it looked cheap. You don't really see much as what you hope for, I think it would have been better if one of the carriages had smashed into another ride, I just wanted to see more blood lol Oh and the tanning scene was just an excuse to get some boobs out, I don't mind seeing topless girls in films, but for one those girls was just annoying and wasn't even that nice, and it was just something to keep lads like me happy, but after looking past the breasts it was obvious that the filmmakers were just trying to cash the money in.Oh and how the hell did this film receive a UK 15 rating, i swear its a fix just to make more money, there are loads of 18 horror films that I can think of that are no way as bad, the only other time I ever thought this was with House Of Wax (What A Film Its Class). Oh and I thought the filmmakers were brave to include the reference to the twin towers, it didn't shock me but I didn't think it was needed.The ending I thought was pretty decent, I just wish the film had of ended the trilogy with a class bang, and I wish Tony Todds character had of come back apart from the voice cameo. Oh and I don't know why but the scene with the rock star little nodder head thing, was that meant to be funny because everyone laughed at it.Overall this is a great popcorn horror movie to watch, but for true fans of the original this is very disappointing, as It had loads of potential to be the best, and I'm hoping there isn't going to be a 4th now.",Final Destination 3
286,GradysGhost,"Entertaining, loads of fun...",7,12 September 2006,"Synopsis: Wendy (Winstead) has a wild hallucination in which she sees her own death, along with about seven others who she is able to save initially, on a roller coaster. Afterward, ""Death"" is out to finish the task that Wendy thwarted. ""He"" has a calculated plan to off the others in the order they would have died on the roller coaster. It is discovered first that intervention can cause ""Death"" to ""skip"" a life and move on to the next, and that the manner of the deaths can be predicted (to a degree) by examining photographs of the survivors taken on the night of the crash.Notes: Before you watch this movie, it is helpful to watch at least the first in the Final Destination franchise for two reasons. First, there are a few comments made in this third installment that allude to the original chapter, although they will not shine any insight on this movie that can't be gleaned by not watching the first picture. Second, if you have seen the first movie, you will know exactly what to expect in the third one. In case you have no intention of ever seeing the others, here's what to expect:A razor-thin plot Characters that you don't care about A high level of predictability Lots of blood and gore A fair amount of profanity If you're expecting a movie that's worthy of literary examination, you're far off. Though the genre of this flick (""Slasher"" flicks, or, as Roger Ebert puts it, Dead Teenager Flicks) can be examined as a whole, this particular one doesn't do anything amazing in direction, cinematography, screen writing, CGI, acting... To put it bluntly, this movie exists for the entertainment value it provides and nothing more. The plot of this movie is almost non-existent. A bunch of high school graduates barely survive death when a freak accident causes Wendy to see the next five minutes of her own life. They are stalked and killed by an unseen force that wants them all to die like they were supposed to. The End. Cue credits. Stand up and leave the theater. What keeps you watching the movie is the incredibly creative and gory ways in which the characters are killed off. Not to spoil the movie, these deaths involve car engines, the contents of a hardware store, and electric tanning beds, amongst other everyday objects.I won't say much more about the ways this movie is bad because these are things that the movie doesn't even pretend to care about. The film is, as a whole, a joke on itself. It knows that it doesn't hold any merit or substance. It doesn't provide a moral message. It doesn't need to. That's not why it was made.When somebody dies here, you can see it coming. The suspense is enough to keep you watching, even if you're not a big fan of splattering innards. The audience will look at the events set in motion during the scene and say, ""This is what's gonna happen, and then that's gonna happen, and then they're going to die this way,"" and then the characters die (or survive in some cases) in a completely different, and often gorier, manner than the audience expected. With respect to shock value and excitement, this movie succeeds.Pros:If you know what to expect, this movie is truly entertaining. Go to see the blood, the guts, and the inventive ways Final Destination 3 kills its characters.Cons:Aside from entertainment value, there's not much to give merit to here. But sometimes, mindless entertainment is all you need.Last Words: If you've seen the first one, if you've seen the second one, if you enjoyed either of them, the third volume of gory supernatural murders is right up your alley. Like watching most Arnold Schwarzenegger hits, FD3 provides fantastic escape from the mundane boringness that everyday life can cause. The movie injects you with the adrenaline that Mondays suck out of you. If you're too much of a movie snob, don't bother with it. I can think of ways that the director could have upped the artistic value of the movie, most notably with the camera work, but what point would that serve? It would only draw your attention away from the fact that characters you don't care about are dying in ways that are so outlandish and contrived that you laugh until you're out of breath. Final Destination 3 is all it needs to be to succeed.See more reviews at http://moviespot.blog.com",Final Destination 3
287,vic_tjiawi,"Cool Movie, i think its better than the previous one !!!!",8,13 March 2006,"It's A cool movie, i thought it wont be good, but i guess I'm wrong, i like this one better. And the female character are cute too, ha ha ha ^^ . well especially Mary Eliabeth Winstead, OMG she is just cute, i really like her. She is a pretty good actress. Even though the movie is good, but still there is still some weakness in that movie, Final DEstination 1, 2 and 3 all of them have the same storyline, except different Character, different ways of dying for the character. Even the way the character dies are also similar. For example on the first one ""Sean William Scott"" head was cut in half, the second one one of character (i forgot who is she, but she is a mother) her head was cut of on the elevator, and on the third one, the Black guy on the Gym, his head was smashed. As i mentioned above even though they have different ways of dying but they all following the same Frame for the movie. another example of similarity in all three movies are all the Character At the end Died, i mean at least let one of them alive, or something. i was kinda mad plus sad when i ""Mary Elizabeth Winstead"" died, i mean why she has to die. well overall the movie is good, it's worth spending your money to see this movie.",Final Destination 3
288,packfanman,Formula Begins to Feel Deadly Familiar,5,14 February 2006,"While Glen Morgan and James Wong may best be known for their work on 'X-Files', their script and direction for 'Final Destination 3' had me wondering what exactly they were thinking. 'Final Destination 2' had the kind of dark humor that kept the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' series afloat throughout the late '80s. However, 'Final Destination 3' eschews the dark humor for some deadly seriousness instead, making it the link to Morgan and Wong's first 'Final Destination'. I just couldn't take it too seriously, especially when death (the big presence, this time only voiced by Tony Todd in the line to the roller-coaster scene) seems to think that the best thing to do to cross these should-have-already-been-dead folk off his list is to take them out in the most incredible ways possible. While the opening credits with the carnival pinball game are quite fun, the fun doesn't translate into the rest of the movie. Too bad - this could have made a really good horror comedic series.",Final Destination 3

What makes this series different from other horror series is that because the villain is death... they can keep coming up with incredible ideas and this is the reason that this series keeps doing well with each new movie. This is the reason that part 3 did not go direct to video. There is a strong fan base for it. This film rocked and had a haunting feel from the well executed opening credits. The ending sure took me by surprise...that is what we want don't we ? to be thrilled,surprised,excited and scared out of our wit.

291,RockmSockM09,A Fundamental Lack of Effort to Live up to it's Own High Standards,5,12 February 2006,"Rarely does a horror film come along that chooses not to follow the current ""safe"" plot ""trends of the moment."" These films make a conscious effort to buck the system, and appear totally fresh and entertaining. One such franchise was the ""Final Destination"" series. Not only did these films ignore trends, they went out of their way to go against ""normal"" horror concepts. As a result, the films garnered quite a cult following. Unfortunately, it is this success that made a third film in the series almost doomed to fail by comparison. ""Final Destination 3"" attempts to trump the success of it's predecessors with more intricate deaths and odd twists of fate, but it ends up falling rather disappointingly flat.Fundamentally, the film completely ignores everything that made the first two so fun. First and foremost is the lack of any likable characters. From the first frame, not a single person is empathetic. Even the lead, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, takes forever to be remotely relatable. Winstead's ally later in the film, Ryan Merriman, requires nearly an hour to seem friendly. The others vary from annoying to outright repugnant. Part of the reason for this is the lack of any backstory.Truth be told, few horror films dwell on what makes characters tick--but the good ones do so in an unobtrusive yet effective manner. In ""Final Destination 3,"" almost every character is a paper thin cliché. The athlete is portrayed as a cartoon strong man. The obligatory ""sex fiend"" is terribly flat. The valley-girl tanning room skanks are drawn so badly, they are from another movie altogether. The characters are so badly constructed, they can't muster up the least bit of empathy.While that would be problematic enough, there's more: The story suffers from an overpowering ""been there done that"" feeling. This is inevitable with any sequel, but it's almost as if the filmmakers didn't even TRY to combat it here. Sadly, the very thing that distinguishes the ""Final Destination"" films--the death sequences--suffers from this the most. The scenes themselves are so involving that it seems as the director is trying too hard. But what's more unnerving is that there's no suspense: From the first drip of water on the tanning mechanism, to the nails on the floor of the hardware store, every death is telecast from miles away. Whereas the setups for each death in the first two films seemed more subtle, these seem more pedantic and predictable. The other thing that undermines the sequences is that EVERY ONE is complex. The charm of the first two movies came from not only the ""Rube Goldberg"" deaths, but the ""jarring deaths,"" as well. While the death of the French teacher in the first film was the result of temperature changes in her tea, one ""survivor"" at the end dies instantly while smiling on a street corner in Paris. These ""shocking"" deaths that made the complex ones so much more resonating. Another misstep here is the lack any well-written comic relief, something the first two films were so successful at providing. Who can forget lines like ""I'll put it on in silent mode"" from ""Final Destination 2?"" Rarely does a memorable line like that appear, and it's sorely missed. True, Merriman's comment about Ben Franklin is great, but it's too little, too late. More moments like that could have saved this film.The film seems oddly out of place among it's predecessors, as well. The first two films were about someone's ""feeling"" that something bad would happen, and their subsequent attempts to evade Death and convince others to do the same. Here, the film seems more about digital photography and weird visual clues that can help solve each death. It's almost as if the filmmakers were handed a script about a series of photographs that foretold the future, and were asked to re-work it as a sequel.Another oddity is the intentional absence of adults in the film: We never hear more than two lines from anyone over 18. The result is a strange, vacuum world--kind of a horror film ""Logan's Run."" The first two films showed how people from several walks of life/ages were drawn together by Death's plan. In ""Final Destination 3,"" the occurrences seem minimized-- as if they exist only in a campfire tale.""Final Destination 3"" also suffers from it's share of logic flaws. During the opening sequence, the Amusement park staff seems more disgusted than alarmed that someone is screaming for her life to get off the roller coaster. And after several kids say they want to get off, too, the staff literally says ""NO ONE ELSE GETS OFF THIS RIDE!"" This would never happen under any circumstances. The film even falters technically. While the overall cinematography is mediocre, it's the death sequences that really suffer. Editing is shoddy, making things seem unpolished. The death scenes in ""Final Destination"" 1 and 2 were shot with odd angles and camera moves, and crisp photography. The scenes here are poorly photographed, and sometimes hard to follow. In fact, the film's key scenes--the roller-coaster and train--are especially bad, to the point where the viewer can't tell what is killing whom.There are some positives: The chaotic gym sequence, the choice of songs, the fact that the Subway stops are ""Booth"" and ""Oswald,"" and the visual transition from tanning beds to coffins. The problem is that these touches are only touches; the first two films were filled with creativity like this. In the end, ""Final Destination 3"" is fighting against the current of mediocrity throughout. Any occasional sparks of originality seem like afterthoughts. The film suffers from an overall lack of effort on the part of the writers and the director--something they could have prevented. It's unfortunate that such an original franchise has fallen to the blade of film's version of the Grim Reaper: lack of originality, and being eminently forgettable.",Final Destination 3
292,roadrunner2n,Weaker then the first two....,5,12 July 2006,"I read some of the comments from people who rated high this movie... and what I gathered is that they loved it only because of the gore... which I agree that is far ""worse"" then in the previous two movies...However I think the director missed the point : it's not about the gore but the way the deaths happen... In this movie the deaths lack the element of surprise that I enjoyed in the first 2..the deaths in this one are predictable, don't have anything ""out of the ordinary"" and somewhat ""simple""On a small note: while I do not give too much importance to the script when in comes to this kind of movies it did bothered me a little (no where near as much as Van Helsing's :))",Final Destination 3

But the acting and the character development was actually better than all of the movies.,Final Destination 3
294,Deagy,Excellent,10,12 February 2006,"I've always been a huge fan of the Final Destination series, mainly because it got me to look at the world in a whole new light. Granted, a slightly paranoid light, but a new light all the same. Any film capable of doing this deserves some recognition! The first and second were 2 gory, brash and trashy films, and didn't attempt to pretend they weren't, and the third followed the same route.The plot in itself was pretty thin, and the characters were really just people on a hit list, no strong characterisation, but then, it wasn't needed! This is a no brainer snuff movie and it rocks. Some gratuitous amounts of gore, and a little nudity here and there and you have the perfect film to waste away the boredom welling up inside you after sitting through Harry Potter. The actors all do fine jobs, and the special effects are pretty much top-notch (when they're not CGI) and the pace just moves along nicely.The 2 major bad points are : The CGI - It was pretty noticeable, and it did take away some of the magic of the Roller-coaster scene,in my opinion anyway, and secondly, it was way too short and there weren't enough deaths in it! That sounds a little demented, I know, but I actually found myself yearning for just a little more... but no. Excellent ending though, it surprised me, I have to say.A good strong film altogether, a perfect date movie, but you'll never EVER look at a Tanning Bed (or a picture for that matter) the same way again.GO SEE IT!",Final Destination 3

During the beginning, there is a lot of sex humor which is very awkward due to the fact that the actors are in their twenties playing teenagers. It just feels wrong. Some of the editing is a little too MTV-quick. You miss out on probably really cool effects. Obviously the highlight of the movie is the killer death sequences. I thought they were well executed and very realistic looking. However, like I said before, sometimes they just happen too fast so you can't get a good look. A lot of the characters will irritate you, but it makes it easier to accept and appreciate their untimely deaths.",Final Destination 3

In fact, I thought it was the worst of the bunch. I guess I had higher expectations since I really liked the first 2 and thought this one would top them off especially from what I had heard about it. I left thinking I spent $7 on that??? Just a huge letdown from my standpoint.Not sure if there will be a 4th film in this series, but if so, let's hope FD4 is much better than FD3. Not really sure what is left in terms of storytelling. After a while the deaths are different, but the story is pretty much the same. If you've seen the first and second, you can pretty much guess how the third one ends.",Final Destination 3
297,Straker17,For the Fans,4,10 February 2019,"I said in my review of the second film that sequels usually work best when the original team is involved in the production. This film threatens to derail my argument. The third film in the series, it appears that they are running out of ideas with the plot, instead putting effort into the elaborate death scenes. The film operates in very similar fashion to the second entry in the series, although the film is more unlikeable due to several factors.The characters are mostly detestable and vapid. Whereas the first film managed to make you root for the characters to avoid death, this film could almost make you cheer when the characters bite it. The sole black character of the movie is an absolute trainwreck of a person, cocky and aggressive, he proves to be the most satisfying victim of death. All of the other characters behave rudely to each other. It is infuriating to see how these characters have an utter lack of respect for each other. It is telling when the two most vapid characters of the whole movie end up being the nicest.But these awful characters can't even be redeemed by good performances. While no performance is particularly bad, there aren't going to be many awards given out, with the exception of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who gives a high caliber performance. She, in fact, proves to be one of the only redeeming quality of this movie. Otherwise, we're left with a pretty bland cast, who either overact or give relatively lifeless performances.
The movie is completely devoid of originality, which is one of the reasons why the original film worked so well. The second film, while convoluted at best, at least attempted to bring something new to the table. This film's big idea? Photos. And while, admittedly, it is cleverly executed, it dies not save the movie form being derivative and somehow emptier than the second film.It is also entirely frustrating to yet again watch people discover deaths plan. The second film was smart enough to bring back a character who briefly explains the rules. Here, our characters are left to discover it on their own. And boy, do they take their sweet time doing it.The biggest sin this movie commits is an utter lack of truly memorable and effective scenes. The roller coaster sequence fails in comparison to every other premonition in the series. The deaths are half as effective as the two previous films, as there is no taut feeling here. The tension present in the first two films is nowhere to be found here, and it's attempts at humor are pretty dull. The deaths prove to be little more than quick blood splatters, or drawn out burning. And they fail to make you feel any kind of sympathy.Fans of the series will definitely find reasons to love this movie. Bolstered by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, it does manage to create some amount of energy, allowing it to escape boredom. And the deaths are creative enough to give the fans something to talk about, and allows them to get their money's worth, For most other viewers, however, the film is going to fall apart once you begin to criticize it.If you are in the mood for a mindless horror film where you can let out the occasional whoop at the gory mayhem, this is one of the most perfect film you can find to watch. If you have any other purpose for watching this movie, you would be better off skipping it and finding something else.",Final Destination 3
298,billm-17,Plot?,6,22 February 2006,"Well, having never seen the Final Destination 2, I was pleasantly surprised by this third installment. Not by the acting, dialogue, or plot I promise you. Final Destination 1 was for the plot. The whole originality of it, the unknown and the always guessing made it irresistibly enjoyable. This movie is for the lovers of Saw, but not to that extent. The deaths are, for lack of a better word, fun. You are told just who is going to die and how, but that doesn't matter. There is the smallest hint of unknown that captivates the audience in a manner of, ""Wow, I wonder just how bad it's going to look!"" In the back of the theatre, there was a group of people laughing and continually saying, ""Oh snap!"" or ""Bitch got what she asked for!"" which really displayed the unattached feeling that the audience feels towards the characters. What I hope, this movie did not try and extract an emotional sympathy and understanding from the audience (they had the first 2 movies to do that), rather it was a method of showing some cool scenarios and getting the audience to collectively scream, ""Oh snap!"" (which we did)The biggest problems with the movie are the blindingly unbearable foreshadowing and revealing of character traits. Everything that our little heroine looks at just screams, ""Wow, you've already seen this, maybe it will happen again!"" The audience just gets annoyed by all of the over-the-top antics of showing deja vu and coincidence. The revealing of character traits is also extremely overbearing. The viewer is told 4 times (maybe more) that our heroine is a control freak. And these are not spaced out and hinted at with symbolism or irony, oh no, that would be too high-brow. For example, when she is in mourning she states something along the lines of, ""It hurts I'm such a control freak and I couldn't control their lives."" My God almighty!If you enjoyed the first 2 editions of this trilogy, then by all means buy a ticket. If you like plot, character development, dialogue, and anything else that isn't gore...

I loved the new twist of Death going after people, a force you could actually be scared of. A good mix of characters you just don't want to die and the ones you want to die bloody.Death was an intricate force that carefully manipulated their lives into its grand plan. The black guy/ who I think is a manifestation of death adds to the atmosphere. The deaths are broad imaginative and the idea of a third since I was glad Kimberly survived was sort of sad since I knew it would adiós... only I think that both A.J Cook and Michael Landes refused to be in this movie.I cheered death on, the characters were two dimensional and grated on me. First the very idea of a roller-coaster was a bad excuse for the writers to get out of coming up with something to top the plane and pile up.Then, then we were forced to look at Wendy... who by the way was my biggest reason for yelling 'go death'. No sign of the strange black guy... who probably refused as well to be in the movie- that broke canon, as did not having a single character from 2.The tanning bed, nail gun every death was another painful reminder that this movie just sucked. But there is a happy ending annoying Wendy and her brat sister are on a train, Wendy gets a premonition and they go out anyway.... in closing Final Destination 3 has killed the franchise....

I might have missed another point as i know its not always one thing in these films but I thought i would just get the word out. Anyway I think the film rocks and is an excellent end to the trilogy.

I have racked my brain over and over to figure this out but I can't, so here goes. The Law of FD:1. People die in the order they would have if they had died in the original accidentIf this is true, what would have happened if Ian McKinley died in the warehouse? How would Wendy have died. Surely, following the rule, she would be the last to die, yet Ian would have already been dead, so how could she have died? Sorry but I am quite confused and didn't really know where else to post this.Just a little brain scratcher for you.",Final Destination 3
303,rob_gareau,This movie makes me sad to think it actually is the FINAL destination,1,17 August 2006,"I apologize in advance for the rant that I make in the following comment. I just figured that if I had to sit through a disappointing 90 mins of my life, then you can read all about the disappointing 90 mins of my life that I had to sit through.This was an awful sequel to a good series of movies. The movie was just an excuse to show blood and death. The opening scene also makes very little sense when you watch it. The movie starts off with a hole in the plot which I noticed as soon as it happened. The camcorder that causes the accident to happen leaves the roller coaster when Frankie leaves. No Frankie = no camcorder = no accident. Also they showed us the huge control board with a bunch of controls. As soon as they saw the wheel falling off the cart they would have pressed a button to turn all the power off. There's no way you can tell me that there was no power button on that huge control board.The script and plot made little sense and the characters were so unrealistic it made me want to actually go visit the movie writers and ask for my money back. All the deaths in the first 2 movies are completely misleading or out of the blue like when Terry gets hit by the bus in the first one or the long first death scene in the second one. The third one made it way less enjoyable by having clues put into the pictures and it took all the suspense out of the movie. I turned to my friends and said how each one was going to die 5 minutes before they actually died. The thing that made the first movie good was that there was a plot in the movie. The FBI following the main character and having them think he was causing the deaths. The second one even had a glitter of a plot in it by linking all the survivors in the second one to the deaths in the first one. The third film had no plot whatsoever. It was just 2 people going around warning people they were going to die, then watching them die. The gore was pretty good, if you like gore, but even gore freaks have to look at it and say ""Wow the chances of that happening are slim to none.""The characters made the movie even more retarded than it had to be. They all just watch their friends die in a freak accident and the only ones who care are the 2 main characters. Even after that, when Wendy tries to warn them they just laugh at her even though she has perfect proof to back it up. As the people start dieing one by one the rest of the people don't care and that makes the characters so unbelievable that it makes me angry. In the first movie the scene where they are driving in the car and Carter decides he gets to decide how is life plays out is one of my favorite scenes. It shows that the characters understand what they have gotten themselves into and that they are afraid of dieing. The second movie had that too when Eugene tries to kill himself with the cop's gun. But the third movie has no character development and when the characters die you just turn to your friend and say ""FINALLY!!!"" Basically this movie could have been good...if there was a plot, if the characters didn't lack the traits of any normal human being, it the deaths were a little more realistic and if there was a little thing people like to call ACTING. If they make a Final Destination 4 they should kill off people using realistic deaths. Heart attacks, car accidents, alcohol poisoning, cholesterol maybe. FD3 sucked and i don't see how it could appeal to anyone. (not even gore freaks)",Final Destination 3

I love everything about the movie the way it was made, the actors, just everything I also love the beginning for some reason it's great, awesome, and also very freaky. I think its great. Mary Elizabe Winstead is a great, great actress. She is very beautiful and she seems very nice. I'm a big fan of her she very pretty i love all the pictures of her. Also the director, James Wong and the people who wrote the credits did an amazing job on the movie. Very Very good job. The movie was well done.

I loveeeeeeeeee him I wish I could just meet him one day for at least i minute and tell him how much great and amazing I think he is. I think he's soo cute in every movie I watch lot of movies from him not only because he's hot but also because he is an amazing actor that really does his best all the time.

I won't spoil it though, to let anyone read this far to experience the fear this movie delivers, how it psychologically dances in the mind, and how it feels to foresee your unpleasant fate, or death (that's too little for a spoiler, but just to make sure), DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS by the scores above (for those new to the series).After watching this, I phoned my best friends right away and write this review.

That will leave you with thoughts of dought about taking your next roller coaster ride. The movie is filled with tons of shocking death scenes, and gore. Maybe a little much for those with a weak stomach. I thought the story was over all better than part 2. It leaves you with a good ending to complete The Death Trilogy. The actors pretty much unknown, do a great job of keeping you in the feel of the movie, as you take the death ride of your life. The only thing really missing in the film was the actual sense of death. It seemed to be put off to just some wind blowing, and light flickering, even though death was always on there trail. You never get the feeling that death is actually in the presence of someone. I give it 4 out of five stars, because the plot couldn't possibly live up to the original, and for the less then stellar cast.",Final Destination 3
307,birkin,"blood, death, and gore",10,8 February 2006,"If you've read the other reviews, you'll know this movie is one you'll either hate or like for the most part, I personally thought it was the best of the three. I have to say some things about what one guy said, complaining of the non-eloquence of death in the death scenes, I won't spoil any for those of you who don't know, but no matter how death dealt with them in the first film, it really wasn't about eloquence... they were suppose to die, and for no dying at that time they were suppose to, they are going to pay dying brutal and painful deaths.At the screening I was at, everyone seemed to love it. It somehow managed to actually have some decent comedy in it and not many failed attempts at it. The acting... I'll be honest, I really suck when it comes to telling this whole ""good"" and ""bad"" acting thing... to me it seemed alright. Every death other than the tanning bed one (which I ""reveal"" because anyone who saw the trailer knows it happens) had the basic idea of most of the people in the audience having no idea whatsoever what was going to happen. Personally, all the kills were among my favorites of the series, no matter how simple they may have been (and yes, even questionable as to their possibility of occurring). This was a great way to end the series, where the finale of the movie fits into the true style of the Final Destination films.It comes down to something you'll have to see for yourself... if you don't think you'll like it, you probably shouldn't go see it. If you're thinking about seeing it, wait until it's at a cheap theater. If you really wanna see, go ahead and see it when you can, there's a pretty good chance you'll walk out smiling. If you like gore, I don't see how you'd be let down, it's the most violent of the series.On another point, I liked hearing the original Final Destination opening theme over the opening credits of this one again- ah, the memories.",Final Destination 3

Apparently whomever made this movie thought that by making it insanely gory and making the deaths into what are the worst and most gruesome of the three movies it equaled scary, and it doesn't.

Although the movie was throughly enjoyable at all time, three scenes that standout are the incredibly well shot roller coaster incident, the two girls burning in the tanning beds and a scene which includes a nail gun.This movie is not for people with the faint of heart, some scenes will have you in the grip of your seat and you will jump many times. I recommend this movie for the horror fans who haven't seeing it yet. I remember being scared when they release it back in 2006.

All characters in film look so primitive, that it's almost unrealistic(also wooden and clownesque). Hey!! and I watched FD#1 and #2 they were not bad at all, though a little boring, but funny. It seems that the sequel of series has degraded, as the publisher wanted to milk some more money of audience. That's it, I didn't make it over half an hour, though usually I watch films till the end.

I hate horror films, but I still think I have an objective enough eye to say that this is one of the stupidest horror movies... no, one of the stupidest movies of all time. The final destination series is a one-note franchise. People die in ridiculous ways as a result of contraptions that are downright Rube Goldberg in nature. In other words, it's ridiculous and this entry into the franchise takes the premise of the original movie and beats it to death even more(it's not like they did that in the first two anyway, right?).Like I said, the movie consists of nothing but ridiculous over the top gory deaths resulting from atrociously idiotic chain reactions that nothing, no, not even death could possibly stage even if it tried.The movie is about young, dumb stereotypical teens we couldn't possibly care about in a million years who basically... all die. Yes, if you've seen the first Final Destination movie, you've basically watched all the sequels, and by saying that I think I'm giving the original movie way too much credit.I felt I had to review this movie because I am so surprised that this movie has an insane rating on the IMDb here.. a 6.0 out of 10? Are you frickin' kidding me!? The only reason this has such a high rating is because stupid jackass teenagers came on here, created 10 accounts under different user names and gave 10/10 to this stupid and obnoxious movie.

The deaths were realistic except for the workout death (hint: He doesn't dye by the swords). The acting was above average for a high school horror film. The editing was really really good, it was good when needed and then quick when needed. I like how the writers made the photos a foreshadowing of each death that was a very nice English(effect used in books to foreshadow something of importance) feature. The first two/three death scenes were slow so that you(the audience) could see how the death like Rube Goldberg (cartoon artist who drew machinal inventions) were done and then on the later deaths, they were picked up so that you would have to think fats like the characters in the film. The ending, I thought, was well done even though I guess that it was shot many times reportedly because audiences didn't like it.

They're like those little domino-esquire setups (they have a term for it for which I can't remember).. you know, the ball hits the stick which then wacks the coo-coo clock, and then the beak goes through your neck as you're trying to reset your clock. Man, this 10 line minimum thing is BS. This is all I had to say about the movie, and I'm only on line 7. Damn. Okay what else. Oh I wish they would've put more effort into characterization. It was too 'in my face'. I mean right off the bat they shoved each character smashing towards screen: here's the heroin!

The movie wants an excuse to show (dramatic gasp) women boobies and nipples (one of which is clearly fake, no plastic surgeon under the sun would give a teen plastic surgery on her breasts unless she was 18+ and/or had A cup breasts at age 17 or younger). I watched the triology over the course of a few nights, hoping for something to make me go ""this is why this movie is iconic in horror movie history!"" and I honestly just didn't get that.It seriously felt like (across all FD movies up to this point), the behind the scenes people just wanted an excuse to shoot on film creative ways and/or nonsensible ways for people to die.

Practically no blood, and I just didn't enjoy it nearly as much as I did the freeway accident on FD2. The storyline thereafter was pretty decent. I really didn't like the tanning bed death only because so many things had to be set into motion before the girls were killed. The rest of the deaths were decent, I loved the nailgun.The ending was pretty good too. Better than the cliché 'Good guy beats the bad guy' - who in this case is death.I really did enjoy the movie though, it's pretty suspenseful, and the filmmakers always trick the viewer because you think something will kill the character but after it misses, something else does.

319,state_of_fear,WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!that movie was crap,2,14 February 2006,"I just got out of the cinema from seeing final destination... now ill tell the truth, i wasn't gonna see it cause it looked crap. But my friends were going and i found a ticket on the floor which just so happened to be the right movie at the right time.i liked final destination and the second one was OK i suppose but it was a really good idea and in my opinion the film makers sort of ruined the concept of the film by making it. I suppose some of the death scenes were OK but otherwise it was just cheesy as hell. Some of the deaths seemed more like a game of mousetrap then a murder (you have to see the film to know what I'm talking about)Anyway the film is mainly about a girl called Wendy who (exactly like in the other ones!) sees a premonition of a roller-coaster shes about to board crashing and everyone on it dying. so she starts to freak out and manages to get about 6 people of the roller-coaster then it crashes exactly like she saw and everyone who stayed on it dying. Then she reads up about a flight where a boy did the same as her and all of the survivors died in mysterious ways (Final destination 1). Andd so she begins her quest to try to stop the survivors from getting killed from death itself.This idea of film trilogy is getting very repetitive now. First a plane crash, then a car crash and now a roller-coaster crash. How many vehicles are there left to do a final destination film on. maybe a bike crash or boat even. I'm not sure if they are planning to make another one but we can only hope that they can quit while their ahead!Although i did not like the film most people probably will and so any people who like main-stream horror films will probably like this film.",Final Destination 3

No, they are disgusting. Foul and revolting. However blood thirsty you are i am sure you will agree.The worst thing was i went to see this film at the cinema. What a waste of £5!

Plus unlike Final Destination 2 this third installment doesn't even have the benefit of a really show stopping crash to set the scene.Rollercoasters are innately exciting and scary but here the only exciting thing about the theme park is the set up shots over the opening credits.The other strength of the 'plot' should be the inventive way each identikit teenager meets his maker, but here each death scene is so hackneyed even death himself seems to have phoned in his performance this time.I went in with very low expectations, but this film failed to meet even those.

In any case, it wasn't supposed to be good, just entertaining So, did Final Destination 3, the third in a line of movies whose premise was: ""someone (who is young and attractive) gets a premonition that they, and others (who are mostly young and attractive), would die in a freaky violent accident; they freak out and this saves them until they all die in freaky violent accidents at a later date anyways"" entertain me? I am afraid that, apart from the idiocy of the characters (they refuse to believe in her premonitions despite the roller coaster and then the later deaths, as well as being completely oblivious to their surroundings) which was quite amusing, the movie was on par with the ""Scary Movie"" franchise in making fun of horror movies, except it wasn't supposed to be a parody... The uselessness of characters actions, in that people trying to escape Death will always die anyways, is an exercise in futility that was obvious by the second movie, and is now like beating a dead horse's skeleton (it's been dead a looong time). No one in the movies escapes Death, and that makes it boring, at least to me, since there is no tension, no competition. The kids will always die by the end of the movie. Yawn. Give me a real surprise the audience expects them all to die, they expect that last scene where the ""bad guy jumps up for one last scare"". ""Scream"" made fun of it, and that was in the 90's! Get with it Hollywood, this hack-ery is getting on our nerves. How about something original for a change? Each death scene sequence was filled with gore (which was the main purpose of the film, considering you know that it will suck), but gore does not a movie make. Movies do much better when they include some kind of acting and back-story with the gore. The cartoonish amounts of gore are not necessarily bad I love the Sam Raimi Evil Dead series; the conscious effort to make the movie humorous through a ridiculous amount of goriness (example: Ash has a death struggle with his own hand) makes it a cult classic. Dawn of the Dead (2004) was action packed and resident tough ass Ving Rhames did the graphic ass kicking. Whereas both of these movies have lots of gore, they both have decent acting and great fighting unlike Final Destination. A horror movie should have a good villain, one that you get to hate. Final Destination 3's villain was a faceless force that set up elaborate traps. It is hard to hate something faceless. Zombies, Dracula, whatever just give me something to boo at and, possibly, to fear. Instead, they go the way of the ""force of evil"". There was no running from death; just surviving its traps so no chase scenes either! Instead, the characters just stumble around in dangerous places full of morons who pin sharpened swords to walls, leave their trucks in drive on steep hills, rest cold drinks on electrical boxes, knock the restocking caddy from Home Depot into shelves and drive like maniacs (nearly hitting a poor truck driver at one point). The villain is handed a task on par with screwing in a light bulb these kids are morons. Final Destination 3 was not so much a movie as a Rube Goldberg Machine showcase. (A Rube Goldberg machine is any exceedingly complex apparatus that performs a very simple task in a very indirect and convoluted way.) Death sets up elaborate traps where any one triggered instance could miss and the whole thing would be moot. Also, Death appears to know when everything will happen; for instance setting up a short circuit for a train when a man's candy bar is thrown and a rat attempts to get to it, connecting a wire that was cut, causing a train wreck. What if the man did not throw out his half-eaten candy bar? Death knows that he will and sets up a whole scenario around it then wouldn't Death know when the kids would foil his well-laid plans? And then wouldn't Death just know how to kill them in the first place? A huge plot hole if there ever was one. Death kills people everyday how are these kids getting away, even if for only a second? What would you do if you had universal power over all things and you had to knock off a couple of these people? Build a trap that resembles a cartoon mousetrap? What the ****?!If I was Death, I would not conceive of elaborate schemes to kill them how about giving them a heart attack or a cerebral hemorrhage or an inoperable brain tumor? Now, I realize these deaths lack the required flare and glitz that burning someone alive in a tanning salon does, but Death pulls this crap on normal people all the time and it works quickly, automatically an it is fail safe. No one gets out alive. Heck, Death controls their bodies and can give them all sorts of weird diseases. Why the weird accidents Death sets up? It makes no sense. I may be reading into it too far, but the movie makers were obviously not thinking when they made it. I don't suggest seeing this steaming pile of film, but if you do, bring aspirin and get ready to see filmmakers play a dumbed-down version of Mousetrap on screen.",Final Destination 3
327,figgis86,Ridiculously hilariously scary!!!,8,10 March 2006,"Teen horrors irk me and sequels are generally irritating. Not this one, with it's spectacular imagery, such as the theme park at the beginning, making you wonder ""isn't this supposed to be predictable and clichéd"". What occurs at the beginning is an example of how the film rattles the cages of those safety zones you'd rather be kept locked away. The director obviously intended there to be fun frights from start to finish (you will never listen to Ronan Keating's ""Life is a Roller-coaster"" quite the same again). Without giving anything away, the director delivers the frights like a bullet to the head. Even when you know something is coming, the anticipation of what is about to happen to our lovable teens is equally unpleasantly enjoyable. Take a group of mates along. You will all agree that it makes the deaths in 2005's ""Doom"" look like an episode of BBC's ""Casualty"".",Final Destination 3

I went to go see this with a group of friends expecting to have a good time and I did I suggest this movie to anyone looking to not worry about a plot or the dialogue or the acting and just sit back and have fun yelling for characters to live, being shocked by the deaths and laughing after wards its a movie i've been waiting for, because there hasn't been a good silly horror to me since House of Wax. You'll really like this if you ended up seeing When A Stranger Calls, this one is definitely not PG!!

The film opens in the usual way: A vision of a violent accident, gratuitous blood and death, and a warning nobody heeds or believes. Though there are some survivors of the roller-coaster crash, the ones who didn't survive were essentially the lucky ones. Because Death wants the survivors' lives, and Death always gets what he wants in the end. Now, one by one, the 10 survivors of the fatal crash are being stalked by an unseen force, bent on finishing his design. And this time, he's mad as hell. Operating on borrowed time, the survivors must try to figure out Death's design, and exploit it's flaw to cheat him again. But how? For me, I think what makes this movie so great is that it closely follows the outline mapped out in the first two movies, and pretty much eliminates much of the guesswork. You already know who's going to die, and in which order, it's just a matter of waiting and finding out how. Like in every Final Destination, the death scenes are very creative, ranging from slightly overdone, to downright absurd, to ""Whoa, didn't see that coming!"" Any fan of the Dead Teenager genre of thriller movies must see this movie!

330,SDRBLUEGRASS,Way better than I expected!,7,3 March 2006,I went with a friend to see this movie and didn't expect very much. I have to say that I was actually shocked at how good it was. The acting was very great but the bloody deaths more than made up for it. The scenes where the people got killed were some of the goriest that I have seen. Also I went to see this without seeing the first 2 in the trilogy. This weekend I am planning to watch the first two movies and I am hoping that they are the same way that this movie was. Hopefully I will not be disappointed. I was really impressed with this flick! If more filmmakers would get back to just showing the audience some good gore then they wouldn't have to rely on special effects so much.,Final Destination 3
331,Velvet_Roses,Ugh...,3,23 September 2006,"I suppose you have to have rather low standards to love FD3. I saw the first one a couple of years ago and liked it, I thought it was original, and a perfectly acceptable movie to spend a Friday night with a big bowl of popcorn and a few of your friends. When I was told about that second sequel I thought it would be the same. But oh my God. That was horrible ! I mean all the characters were awful clichés, from the all-American jock to the goth freak, and not forgetting the cool black guy. Apparently it was done on purpose but to me, it's just an awful lack of imagination. The acting is just average and the plot is the same as in the first two, with a lot of very unfunny jokes, the screenplay is poor and predictable, the editing is very low, and the score is almost bad. Even the gore (which is probably the reason most people will want to see ""Dead Teenager Movies"", isn't gory due to the lack of stressing atmosphere and surprises. Whatever, I hated it, it was one of the worst horror movies and one of the poorest plots I've ever heard of. The only thing I actually liked was that special feature on the DVD that's called ""Choose their fate"", in which, by using your remote, you flip the coin to decide on the fate of the characters. Interesting, it gives a little bit of suspense to the film, because you never know if you might save them or not...",Final Destination 3

335,singles00,Running out of ways to die?,6,7 March 2006,"Sequels are notoriously to be taken with a pinch of salt. For the first two instalments, the Final Destination formula had worked alright, teenagers dying gruesomely in succession and sadism aplenty. No wonder its third chapter is released already, promising to do exactly what is expected. Final Destination was never the most complex of horror tales to begin with, yet this time seriously- not even one iota of imagination is in place. It doesn't even take parts 1 or 2 an inch further, like most sequels instead are set to do.As it's exactly like the first two (except different cast and slightly different ways to die), it actually crosses your mind whether director James Wong just aimed at an exercise of the kind: alright guys, now let's try it over again; Got your body mangled in a pile-up? Now try and get your cranium squeezed like a spot by a fork-lift truck, see which one works better. Did the lift-doors leave you decapitated? Now check out how many limbs you lose while at a fairground However, if you don't set it in context with its predecessors, Final Destination 3 does its job and is honest enough. For a roller-coaster-phobic like myself, the initial scenes are absolutely terrifying, a 5-minutes gore-fest that leaves your palms drenched in sweat... And would you believe it, this simple, unassuming movie even managed to stir some controversy in the US where the 'Los Angeles Daily News' denounced ""its vulgarity on its blood-caked sleeve"" calling it ""cynical enough to use 9/11 in its vapid story lane!"".

The deaths are always so creative and unpredictable. I'm really glad James Wong is back in the director's seat (not that David R. Ellis did a bad job). I just feel better having the original director do the sequel. Same goes for writer Glen Morgan. These guys have the wildest imaginations. I was so amazed at how they were able to make up a whole new story just when I thought it couldn't get any better. They came up with more gruesome deaths that are, I'm sorry to say this, quite humorous, but could make you shiver just thinking how painful it would be if it was you. People have probably already seen this in the trailers but I'll list it as a spoiler anyway. The girls frying in the tanning beds. That was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen! The scene actually lets you see them burning and their skin blistering! I actually felt sorry for them! Ahh.. death can be so cruel. NOTE: Great movie",Final Destination 3

The scene about the roller coaster will make me think twice about going to the fair!

The second she sees the car accident and she holds up traffic and there you go. In the third installment they had good death scenes but the roller coaster shouldn't have crashed the same way as her ""dream."" In her dream the main thing that screwed up the roller coaster was when the camera guy said ""show me them titties"" and the girls knock the camera out of his hands and onto the tracks exploding and causing the coaster to go askew and begin the crash sequence. That kid got off the coaster and took his camera along with him. Thus the crash shouldn't have happened the same way.

342,Hilde7085,Better than 2... but nothing beats the original,8,6 May 2007,"I know these movies are seemingly pointless and gory. They're very formulaic but this one just stands above the second in the series. The second tried too hard to connect to the first film and ended up creating confusion and plot holes as a result.That said, all the Final Destination movies make you look at death differently which allows me to see them as slightly above other gory films. This one also examined the idea of being unable to control rollercoasters and how when your're on them it's 40 seconds of your life that you put into a machine's hands. It was a different mode of engineering gone wrong to examine which also made this movie stand out in the series.The acting was pretty convincing although I was disappointed that the characters seemed less inclined to believe in this movie and I also felt there was less character development than in the previous two films. I particularly enjoyed Alexz Johnson and Kris Lemche's chemistry as the odd and kooky couple although I thought they'd believe in the death theory if no one else did.All in all the deaths were very interesting and the characters I found most frustrating died early. The end was pretty funny as well. It's a very good 3rd film and makes me hope for a 4th.",Final Destination 3

But this one, is my most favorite.The 1st FD was okay to me. Kinda slow in the beginning, the deaths starts a little bit late though. But I love how Terry dies!! CRASH!!! XP The 2nd FD was better. Maybe because its not as slow as the 1st one. The car crash was awesome and I love Ali Larter in the movie. And its kinda sequel to the first film. BTW, the way Evan dies...OUCH!!The 3rd FD is totally awesome!! At first, I can't imagine how can a simple Roller-Coester ride turns out turns out to be the ride of DEATH! But after I watched FD3, I was totally impressed on the way the Roller-Coester crashed! I also love the main character in the movie, Wendy (Mary-Elizabeth Wistead). She delivers her role really well! Especially when she have to act that she saw her friends die in a GRUESOME way (nails through the head, split in two!) in front of her own eyes! And the movie was quite fast. First they were in the Roller-Coester crash, the next thing you know, they get killed one by one. I recommended you don't miss any of the deaths in FD3!

The first two films had a clever script and so does this one, but there is nothing new in the plot to spice things up. It's just a bunch of teens dying from an exotic death.

The plot is good.Yes.What makes this movie different from the rest?PHOTOS.The clues can be seen in the photos and due to this,one will keep on trying to view the photos for clues.Basically,only this let's-find-the-clue-through-the-photos thing makes the movie exciting.Some parts are impossible to happen in real life though.I won't mention them.And the roller-coaster ride scene will definitely keep you hanging.The death scenes were not enough.But the movie was somehow fast-paced.You won't notice that the movie has been running for an hour already.The death scenes were continuous.Therefore,every scene in this movie had been really relevant.You really have to pay attention because every scene gives a clue.All in all,this movie was great.I loved the ending.OH,by the way,if you weren't able to watch any of the first 2 movies, no need to worry!It's not really a trilogy which requires the first two movies to be watched so one can understand the final movie.There's a new set of characters and a new design of death.Though it's a continuation of the first two movies,they're still independent from each other since each movie has a different death design.All you have to know is ""180"" to be able to get what those numbers flashing in some scenes of the movie...BUT BASICALLY,one of the characters here narrates the FLIGHT 180 story to recap the audience or at least give the FINALDESTINATION-1st time-viewers an explanation with regards to some parts of the movie which would somehow connect to the first two movies.WARNING though:really gory. ;)",Final Destination 3
348,neil_barclay,Fufills the purpose,7,11 February 2006,"The Final Destination franchise has never been acclaimed for it's deep characterisation, moving script and perfect acting. Many people, like myself, are there to see the inevitable, inventive fates that Death has in store for each character who cheats his cunning plan. On that front, the third instalment doesn't let us down.I have always been a fan of these films and I can safely say that this is the weakest - but worth a glance anyway. The characterisation is so poor you don't feel for those caught up in the plan. Many are deliberately moulded into clichéd annoyances (particularly the first four victims) to fill the numbers and pass time. You can almost tell who is going to be next on the basis of how irritating each character is rather than the complicated and unbelievable method discovered by main character Wendy. In my opinion, the sequel took it as far as it could go. So when I heard about a third in production last year, I knew it would be silly fun.On the death front (which I suspect why most of us are here!), the opening ""premonition"" scene isn't as effective as 2003's highway scenario. Less gore and imagination. But before they board the killer roller-coaster, the nervousness of the build-up was just as tense as the previous films for me.The deaths that follow are fast and fun. As I suspect this will be the last film, they've gone for outright gore. The cinema audience cringed in disgust in some of the sick ways these nobodies would meet their end. The most disturbing in my view was the sun-bed scene which stretched out for a while.Overall, worth a watch if you liked the first two and can endure a shoddy script.",Final Destination 3

You will be disappointed.In all fair and vague shortness, Final Destination 3 is more or less the same as its predecessors. It is an expanded montage of elaborately staged and immaculately bloody deaths strung together by a simple and undemanding story line.Similar to its antecedents, Final Destination 3 is about high-schooler Wendy Christensen (portrayed adequately by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) receiving a premonition of the ill-fated roller-coaster ride in which she is on board. She panics and manages to save herself and a bunch of her friends (or more appropriately, entrées in Death's wish list), but soon after realizes that Death's in the market for tying up loose ends.If you've decided to give this film a try, then come in with an open mind and just expect fun. Leave your brains at the door, and anticipate gallons of strawberry, juice and banana (creatively mixed up to produce a simulation of blood and bone marrows) to come shooting out of the screen.To grade a film like this, you have to evaluate the artistry of its death sequences, review the mock build up of suspense preceding a death sequence and diagnose the level of bone-chilling each death sequence brings to the table. In short, Final Destination 3 is all about the death sequences. And, suffice it to say, the film succeeds in every level while doing so.Look pass the plot holes gargantuan enough for a train to barrel through. Ignore the poor screen-writing abilities of James Wong, chock-full of dialogues to bury, witty one-liners that never succeeds to pass off as witty one-liners and one or two exchanges so tacky and clichéd until it makes you want to punch nails into your ears. Pay no attention to the strong lack of sturdy character development, or the lack of any kind of sturdy characters for that matter. Do all this, and you might just have a good time.For what it's worth, James Wong tries, but still, the sub-plot about the Pictures which Tell the Future and the Search for the Two Unknown Ride Attendees does not add anything new to the table, and instead, turns out to be very predictable and foreseeable. Without wanting to reveal too much, I just have this to say: If you want your audience to be surprised by the plot twist, make sure you have a couple of red herrings ready. Introduce characters who have decent amount of screen time to pose as the possible potential victims, but not too much as to steal the limelight from any of the ten stars.Nevertheless, as aforementioned, Final Destination 3 is a movie whose sole purpose is to entertain and delight twisted, sadistic fans by introducing new and improved ways to kill off characters who merits their deaths. And, for that, it passed.Verdict: Those who just expect a good time will find this immaculately bloody film to be fulfilling, to say the least. Those who expect more will be dismayed. Regardless, the film hits the targets its supposed to, and that adds up to a good, enjoyable thriller perfect for movie night.",Final Destination 3

The acting was pretty good compared to most films of seen. The music made me stay in the theater after it ended just singing and open credits were amazing. It almost makes up for when roller coasters leak blood in stead of oil for no reason at all and the movies setting seems different in every shot. I would usually draw the line at those but one thing in this movie made me want to see it again and again and again. Kris Lemche. If you're a huge fan you'll be happy to see him as a crazy goth boy. If you're not then stay home and rent Ginger Snaps. It has werewolves.I hate to say this but it was actually very good. And if you're a single male ages 17-34, you'll love this movie.

Final Destenation2 wasn't a great movie, But a good one. So after seeing 1 and 2 my expectations were high..Alas after seeing FD3, I was disappointed, all the characters were so annoying, you did not care about them, every chic in this film wears the best make up, (including the Guys) characters ranged from your bubble headed white girls, to the annoying angry black athlete(badly stereotyped), to your goth/emo couple. In between death scenes there was hardly any plot, along with a shameless way to tie in September 11th(wich made me laugh hard). Fd3 is nothing but a convoluted mess of bad dialog, Shameless product endorsement (to those who seen this movie you all know by now that the products were Panasonic Lumix 5 megapixel camera , Ipod(mentioned), And a Mac G4. Overall the death scenes made me laugh hard!! This movie failed to keep up with FD2s Supirior FX. Overall don't pay 10 bucks. The only people who will enjoy this are the mtv worshiping highschoolers, and those who never had sen a horror movie before. I give this film two watery bowls down!!!!",Final Destination 3
355,nfgmest20,My thoughts,10,11 February 2006,"I couldn't wait for this movie to come out since I heard them talking of making it. Needless to say The movie exceeded my expectations. I was worried that it would suck like sequels sometimes do. but I think this one might be the best one so far. But its hard to say because I loved each one. They did a great job on keeping it from being to predictable. I hate watching movies where I know exactly whats going to take place next. Which occurs more so in horror movies than anywhere else. I think horror movies now are getting ridiculous. They have no real plot just someone going around killing people. They lack imagination. Its good to see that some horror film makers still have imagination. People wonder why the horror genre is so dead, well its because we as viewers have seen the same concept time and time again we're bored with it. Look at films like Nightmare on Elm street, Scream, Halloween. These movies are all classics, and the reason that is, is because they gave us something new. A new twist on a simple concept. Now with that said back to final destination 3. This time around they added something new to the plot which were the photographs. Which I thought great because A girl chasing visions all the time would be too repetitive. The ending was great as well I didn't see that coming at all. So to sum up everything I said.if your wondering whether or not this movie will be worth your time, it is. I highly recommend it as well as any other final destination movie. So to the film makers behind this or any of those movies I give them thumbs up for being creative and not boring us with the same horror crap.",Final Destination 3
356,jrclar,not a patch on the first 2 films plot holes and poorly executed ideas let this film down,5,1 March 2006,The accident being reduced to a roller-coaster crash after a superb plane crash and a very graphic motorway pile up did not do this film any favours. The initial crash is scary but not very gruesome with several people dying off camera simply by falling from the ride. In the first and second films you wanted the cast to beat death because the characters were actually likable but final destination 3 presents you with a list of the most contemptuous and loathsome people you will see in a film like this. There are few real jump out of your seat moments and most of the build up comes to nothing. There are certain elements of the plot that don;t make sense which are essential to the events that follow (the video camera falling on the line triggers the crash but the crash happens in exactly the same way without this element). The deaths are also sub par there isn't a death in this film that beats the well executed death of Todd from the first film and no moments that make you shudder as much as when while being strangled Todd's eyes filled up with blood. With no appearance from the excellent Tony Todd which gave the other 2 films a real sense of doom what we have here is a film that tries to breath new life into the franchise but while trying to be too clever (using pictures to determine how people die which is very poorly executed and exceptionally tedious) and also having deaths which you can usually see a mile off this makes for a mildly entertaining gore film nothing more. Fingers crossed there is not a final destination 4 as this film franchise has run it's course. This film is good for people who just want a bit of fun and a bit of gore but if you enjoyed the first 2 films you will be very disappointed by this.,Final Destination 3
357,amazingliz,Final Destination 3,10,21 February 2006,"This movie was actually quite good. I found it very interesting. I thought it was more disgusting than scary. It was very good though. I was sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. The directors were great because I think it was pretty cool how they took people's real fears and placed them into the movie. I may warn there are a few...a lot, of disgusting deaths. This is by far a very gory movie. I really liked it and would definitely recommend it. I would say the least disgusting death would have to be the one where Kevin (Ryan Merriman) gets burned. Other than that, there were very disgusting deaths. I couldn't watch how some of them died, because just the thought of how they died, was just too disgusting. I really loved this movie and the actors/actresses in it. They all did a wonderful job and the movie was incredibly amazing!",Final Destination 3
358,raderpunk69,The Deaths are great but the Characters are very dull.,7,26 February 2006,"What I liked most about this movie is that it gives you this great dark atmosphere all throughout and never lets you get a breath of fresh air, this is a very dark movie which is one of the reasons I enjoyed it and never stopped me from watching it. The deaths are also new and gruesome, all of them in fact. But the one thing I really hated about this movie is that none of the characters really stood out not even our two main hero's. It's not as good as the characters in the first one as they were better developed and didn't have all that modern day technology with them. This movie is filled with all the latest cool gadgets out there such as the flat T-Mobile phone, an IPOD, and many others but it gets really annoying. We understand your hip and cool now die already! Oh yea, once the first death starts the others come really fast and waste no time. So all I'm saying is be prepared.",Final Destination 3

To me Final Destination 3 is the best of the three. This time around death is angrier and more vengeful. When death comes, it comes full blast take no prisoners. The deaths in this one are even more elaborate and gorier than the second.This related more in story to the legend born in the first. Here is a spoiler... This time around they only used Tony Todd's voice. It's his voice that is the devil and on the train. This disappointed me that it's the only way to work him in.I've been told I'm morbid and maybe it's true. These death scenes made me laugh and laugh hard. Not because they are silly but because they are so gorily.

This was by far the best acting out of all of the three, and the best deaths.The opening scene was amazing and you couldn't look away from the screen. The only complaint is that it was only 93 minutes. They should have made it longer with more deaths. During the tanning bed scene i was squirming in my seat, it was one of them most disgusting and unsettling scenes i have ever seen, but it was so awesome.If you are old enough to handle this movie you will love it, but you gotta have a strong stomach!Final Destination 3 was an awesome movie! 9/10",Final Destination 3

After all that's what would make a movie like this really effective, more realism so you'd think it could really happen to you. Consult your local science teacher. Or is America so dumbed down that they can't see these things?

Not only were there actors that everyone can relate to, but the death scenes were more thought out and detailed. The first two movies, you could guess who was going to die when and how, but with this one, it always keeps you guessing and wanting more. I think that Ryan Merriman was the perfect choice for the role of Kevin. He showed that he can step out of his childish Disney Channel Movie roles and into a movie that requires more from him both physically and mentally. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, and you will jump at least once. I am not saying that the first two movies were bad, because I loved both of them equally, but there is no comparison, this one dominates over the rest.",Final Destination 3
363,hendrixlee102-1,lets hope death has finally set in on this series,2,26 February 2006,"this review will contain some spoilers.first of, the first two were rather entertaining. the whole concept of death having its own agenda was rather interesting. the first thing that this film did not have that the first two did was a link between the two. the first film had its link into the 2nd with the last surviving character from the first. i would have been interesting to see some of the same but it probably wouldn't have been for the best.first off the only thing that was unique and clever were the deaths of characters, usually this series can always dig up an interesting and cinematic way of bitting the dust. unfortunately there were a few things that this one did that the others did not. the first two were rather more random or spontanious w/ the deaths and such. in this one you somewhat know ahead of time how they're going to die with a few of these people.with the upcoming remake of the classic horror film ""the omen"" it seems final destination has taken the concept of picture predictions. if some do recall the omen contained gregory peck with photographs indicating how those working and warning him were to meet their fate. final destination does this with every one of their victims. it isn't that much of a pest yet, with the new remake, most people without any prior knowledge of the original will think that they ripped it off of this poor excuse of enjoyment.the acting is not top notch yet, when was it in the final destination trilogy. i could think of a few moments though int he first two where acting was rather well done, although in this one it mostly seems forced, and all the roles are well stereotyped.one of the things i had a grudge against as i mentioned earlier was the fact that the main character within a 2 minutes of the movie already is in tears, scared because of a carnival/ the roller coaster. it really does give away too much within the first few minutes. she seems too paranoid too early in my opinion. although in the first film the main character did have a fear of flying he wasn't panicking 30 minutes before they even mention going on a plane. this film does so and it contiues and gets irritating throughout the film.the most i can give props to in this film as i mentioned before were the unique writing for killing each and every person.also in my personal opinion the end was a bit dragged. the last two films did always end with a cliffhanger or big blowing off finish as the previous two did but those final sequences barely pushed a minute and a half as this one goes a little far pushing around eight. the whole concept of having another vision was rather forced as i believe that there really should be only one deathexperience vision per flick.overall its quite a dragged and another disappointing addition to finalize a trilogy.",Final Destination 3
364,dubyaforus,"This Time, Death is fighting with a Vengeance",10,28 February 2006,"As the saying goes, three is a charm. Final Destination 3 is the best int he series and kicks ass! I have seen it five times and I recommend it to anyone who loves thrillers/horror films. In the 3rd and final film in the franchise, James Wong and Glen Morgan (Final Destination) return to reinvent the franchise with more gore, and terror. Wongs directing is great and during the opening premonition, you feel as if you're on the coaster. The shots are masterfully done and shows us that you can make a thriller with gore ans still keep the audience hooked. The score by Shirley Walker (Final Destination 1&2, Batman: The Animated series) is also fantastic and keeps you on the edge. In the opening credits she has your heart pounding with suspense to the film. The acting is also very good. Ryan Merriman(Halloween:Resurrection, The Luck of the Irish) gives his best performance yet and his pain and horror becomes yours. He is outstanding and is just a fantastic person, he's great! Mary Winstead also gives a grand performance and is a key role, as Merriman, to the cast. The special effects are gripping and this time around the deaths are more creative and keep you guessing. I myself love Hitchcock and I always say that Hitchcock is the best. But for this film I have to say, Hitchcock could not have done better! This will go down in film history along with the Scream films and the first 3 Child Play films as defining its own area. Again,go see this now! You won't be sorry! I give this an A+++!

Too often the're caught up in impressing their editors, and admitting they liked FD3 just isn't going to do that. But it sure is gonna be O.K. to say they liked Brokeback Mountain, P.C.ness is powerful. It's interesting to compare the much more honest responses of the actual audience to the critics, the internet is enabling us to see to what extent these reviewers are just struggling to impress their editors. It's this it'snotokaytosaytheylikedit syndrome, when they're out at a group social made self-conscious by the presence of other journalists, are they simply going to say ""I had a great time watching Final Destination 3 last night. Brilliant movie.""? With every single one of them in that rottentomatoes listing, the memory of the audience innocently enjoying themselves becomes very distant indeed, but impressing their own private circle & literary agent is what they will strive to do.

Right from the very beginning of the roller coaster accident until the end of the film the action is non stop with gory and well thought out deaths just waiting to happen. The film may only be 90 mins long but hey its 90 mins of gory entertainment. If your squarish this isn't a film for you but if your a cruel friend who loves seeing people squirm at the slightest hint of blood this is the film to take your squarish friends to. Its well worth the laugh trust me i know. James Wong has done it again and created an ass wooping film. You can really tell how much the effects have improved since the last films. Its a must see well worth paying out to go see it on the big screen. Its way better than the first and second combined and I leave you by saying bring on Final Destination 4.,Final Destination 3

Who ever came up with death scenes is pure genius, they were very scary and everyone in the audience screamed and laughed during those scenes. I definitely recommend this movie, especially for those thrill seekers. The one thing that I thought was interesting was the fact that I wanted a couple of the victims to die because they talked too much junk and they wouldn't believe the 2 stars of the movie. I give very high regards to the movie crew members who came up with the death scenes, they were very graphic and believable.

369,simonawalker,Fatally Flawed,6,7 September 2006,"There are a handful of issues that I have with Final Destination 3. The first is the characters.... or the lack of character that they have. In the original film you gained enough background on the characters and build up between deaths, to actually care about them. That wasn't quite as strong with FD2, but in FD3 it's altogether gone.This film really does just seem to be a case of ""how gruesome can we make a death scene"".... and because of the photographs, you can pretty much predict what will happen.Going back to FD1, take a look at the bus death. Other than seeing a ghost bus pass the window as a premonition, you had NO idea what was coming. Likewise with the decapitation at the rail crossing.The death sequences here were simply too long and as a result you didn't care one bit about it. There was no jaw dropping shock moment (bus death in FD1!).My second issue is with the roller-coaster accident itself. In the premonition one thing, and one thing only causes the crash - the video camera. Sure, the hydraulic pipe breaks, but that only affected the safety harness. The roller-coaster crashed because the camera was dropped, wrapped itself around the track and then got hit - damaging the wheels etc.However, after the premonition, the guy with the video camera gets off the ride.... therefore, there cannot possibly be a crash!!!It happens just 15 minutes into the film and it was all I could think about from that point on.A disappointing end to the so called ""Thrillogy"".",Final Destination 3
370,jess_balance,An absolute Must See,10,16 July 2006,I absolutely loved this movie! I am hoping that they make a fourth one. This movies has a great cast and also a great plot sequence. THis movie was not nessicarlly scary but it was a thriller it left you on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen and hoping that the end was no where near. If you haven't seen this movie yet then you should go and see it cause it is a awesome movie... If you are anything like me or my friends and family then you will LOVE this movie to. I believe that this movie is a absolute must see. I believed that the Final Destination Series was over after the second movie because it made you believe that. So if you keep on thinking that then who knows maybe there will be a fourth! Everyone knows that movies are only supposed to come in threes the beginning the sequel and the Trilogy. Well look at The Halloween Series those movies are all time thrillers and they are on there 7th i believe. So i just want to say to everyone this movie is a absolute must see!

By the time i have seen those two i was convinced that its next installment would be a more bloody ""Kill - Teen"" movie, which in fact it was. I always admired the way they pictured the death séances in these movies for the whole time it looks like the person in focus is going to die with an upcoming threat but eventually dies by some other substituted event.In this movie, According to me they could'nt keep the spirit alive and it was very much predictable unlike the other two. So the bottom line is this is a nice movie to watch if you are following the series and doesn't like to miss any part of it.It may come as a disappointment for some people like me.",Final Destination 3
372,king_diblasi,My blood ran cold,9,16 January 2007,Wonderful! An Absolute masterpiece! I was speechless. I loved the idea of a roller-coaster accident. I believe it was much better than a highway or a plane accident. I believe that death has a bloody and gory mind and that's what i love about it. The blood was excellent. One of the goriest movies i've ever seen. I loved the characters. I was pretty upset that Lewis (the black guy) died as he was my most favorite character although i believe his death sequence was the best.I only gave it a 9 because i didn't really see a connection between the other 2 final destinations. I would've liked to see the Tony Todd once again at the morgue. But in the end a great movie which i would recommend to everybody.,Final Destination 3
373,AxelOlivera,A killer thriller sequel,7,17 January 2007,"Final Destination 3, I have to say, is a good movie. I normally don't watch horrors, but THIS one caught my attention. Not having seen the first two before this one, I had no idea what this movie was about or like. Lone behold, I found out quite quickly(duh!).This movie is creative and heart-pounding which makes movies like this worth watching, and everyone likes a good scare here and there. With the cast, the storyline, and not to mention the mood, this movie is a roller coaster all on it's own. It clearly gets you thinking twice about the things that are around you, and even gets you to be more careful if done right(I know I am).Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Disney's Sky High) has the lead role in this film. From start to finish she carries the movie and the flow of it with every place she goes in the film. The new deaths assigned to the characters of this film were pretty gruesome if I do say so myself, and they really make you feel the pain of the characters. I hate to say it, but like in every film like this one, there's always that one character that you really DO want to see go. From burning, to crushing, to being dragged to your death-post by a fast-running horse, this movie really keeps you grossed out, scared, and waiting to see what happens next all at the same time. Although, I have to say, the ending killed me, but it leaves an even bigger reason for waiting for a fourth movie to arrive and shock us with what awaits the victims and us.Leading off with a crazy, yet, unlikely to happen roller-coaster crash, to numerous rising stars you know being killed off in the most tragic and devastating ways that actually make you feel sorry for them, Final Destination 3 is a movie to see. And I saw it TWICE, just because I wanted to.However, if you haven't seen the first, this movie may be hard to understand exactly what's going on, but it's still worth watching if you don't care or even if you do. But, if you're someone who likes/dislikes rollercoasters, and are afraid you'll never ride them again, this movie HAS done it's job, and it's probably not for you.Just the same, you'll probably want to see and like it. I know I did.",Final Destination 3

This movie is great and scared me a lot when i was sitting in the theaters watching it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead does an excellent job at playing the role of Wendy and has been one the best actors in the series so far. The roller coaster accident has also been the best premonition and smartly filmed sequences throughout the series as well. This is definitely recommended even if you haven't seen Final Destination 1 and 2. Now I'm waiting to see Black Christmas to see what James Wong and Glen Morgan (director and writers) have done with that.",Final Destination 3

For some reason the trailer made it seem to be kinda cheesy. However, i could not have been more wrong. As soon as the roller coaster crash occurs its intense all the way to the end. It just seemed like the deaths kept coming and coming non stop. The deaths i thought were very creative and many came to be a surprise. The ending i thought was great and surprising. The acting in the movie i thought was better then in any of the other films. The only complaint i had was that it was only 90 minutes long.

376,jonah116,James Wongs return breathes life into the franchise,8,17 July 2006,"For the uninitiated, the Final Destination trilogy has built itself on a simple yet very clever premise: A group of high school students are saved from a tragic event by the premonition of one of their peers, then one by one they are systematically killed off in increasingly elaborate and gory ways, the only way to survive is to try and beat 'deaths plan'.Writer and Director James Wong returns to the franchise after skipping the second installment and sets the tone early with a foreboding sequence at a theme park where our protagonist imagines the roller-coaster going up in a ball of flames and in her panic, drags seven of her school mates off the doomed ride.Of course the roller coaster does indeed go haywire, killing all the occupants, and now the ball is ready to roll as 'death' looks to catch up on those that escaped his clutches and exact his painful revenge in the order they were seated on the ride.Yes, a contrived beginning, but who cares? Here comes the fun.Final Destination is about the elaborate and messy kills, each one out doing the other and part three does not disappoint.My personal favorites are the two materialistic teen queens who suffer a nasty fate in a tanning salon and the obligatory Gothic character who cops a mouthful of nail-gun in a hardware store.Maybe it all sounds so obvious, and possibly it is, but the tense and clever build up to every kill makes it worthwhile and the pay off will satisfy all you gore-hounds out there.",Final Destination 3
377,LUKE4EVER,"The Rules, Man!",4,17 February 2006,"No, sir, I did not like it.+++Ok, there are plenty of SPOILERS below for all 3 Final Destination films, it could not be avoided. There is also some angry ranting. Be warned.+++ Final Destination has a great premise. Hard to go wrong with it, in fact. Many of the major horror franchises thrive on original and over the top deaths and with FD the possibilities are infinite.Final Destination 2 was a great sequel. It took much of the best features of the first film and cranked it up a notch or two.Final Destination 3 is an example of a wonderful premise and a good franchise being squandered. The deaths, which this series lives by, were uninspiring in comparison to the previous instalments. The 'Big Sequence' of the Roller Coaster ride was fairly uneventful, in truth. Most of the deaths in that sequence were off camera (People falling out) or, due to the coaster's speed, a case of blink-and-you-miss-it. Compare that to the stellar Car Crash sequence in the second film and you realise that a Roller Coaster From Hell might sound great on paper, but it is an extremely linear ride, in all senses.Then there are the slow build deaths. The first film had the long, drawn out death of the teacher. The second had the Kitchen -> Fire Escape sequence. Both of which kept you guessing right until the end. Extremely engaging film making. All the deaths in this came across as either 'BAM!' out of nowhere or blatantly obvious. The Tanning Sequence was indeed long and drawn out, but you could see where it was going right from the off. (And don't get me started on that 'Warning: Must'nt go over 250' Sticker. Suspension of disbelief collapsed in an instant.) The only attempts to throw you off the scent were in the Gym Sequence, however with no-knowledge of the design of that Gym Machine, I couldn't possibly have seen it coming (nor do I understand why those weights swung down like they did: Why were the wires keeping them out? What purpose would it serve letting them swing down at all? Why not bolt them?).Is it just me or did they break their own rule when killing McKinley too? The way it seems to work is that you can only save yourself or others through premonition. The trio ducked the fireworks (Which Death had set in motion) easily and they ended up killing McKinley. So what? By ducking they skipped Wendy? No, since McKinley was supposed to kill her. They killed McKinley and so that saved Wendy? No, if anyone killed McKinley it was Death and his Fireworks. Gah! The idea of McKinley being Death's chosen method was an excellent one, but the execution (in more ways than one) was disappointing.+++END SPOILERS+++ If you haven't seen it, this is not the comment for you. I cannot express my rage at this film without revealing details of it. Please save your money, go see something else. Go pick up FD1 & 2. Please.",Final Destination 3

There are a lot of reasons why Final Destination is cool , well first of all it has shocking death sequences , starting with the Roller-coaster sequence that is definitely the scariest one ( after see this , you will be afraid of get up to a Roller-coaster for the rest of your life )... the subsequent deaths are shocking too ( they have a lot of gore ), but unfortunately it has a very predictable end .the film tries to get something new , that we have not seen in the 1st one or in the 2nd one : the pictures , well that does not really work ... because we already know what is going to happen , the plot does not change....Mary Elizabeth Winstead is amazing , she is a perfect ""scream queen"" i think that she was born to make scary movies ( she is like the Jamie Lee Curtis or the Sarah Michelle Gellar of our era ) , Ryan Merriman was OK and Crystal Lowe was naked ( great !! ) it has a great soundtrack ..........",Final Destination 3

You will only need one of them to follow the plot! If you've seen the first two installments, then there is almost nothing new here. Death follows the same kind of pattern, and strikes in the same ""perverted"" manner. The foredoomed however, they now have clues as to how they'll die. Will it help them beat Death this time? The ending is totally predictable and you won't see the actors nominated for their performance any time soon. Well, nobody's perfect. Overall, I give it a six out of 10.",Final Destination 3
380,samchoi-251-170632,Director Wong is great,8,29 December 2011,"I really loved the opening credits of this film. It introduces the killers of the series. Random objects are the true killers of the these movies. They jump out of the screen and shows us how dangerous they are. Even the most innocent objects can be dangerous. The mysteriousness of the intro is obvious and it became intense when a dead corpse flies out of the screen then random blood splatters the broken glass. The film itself is a remake of the last four films. They added some new rules here but it doesn't change anything. At least this is better than the fourth one but in the end, this is just another sequel(or remake).Here's the thing about Final Destination. It's an intriguing high concept horror movie. But after the second film, they decided to repeat all the things from the first movie and make the deaths more gory than ever. They added new things here like the ""Kill or Be Killed"" concept. It's pretty interesting but it doesn't make any changes. That concept just made the climax more psychological and create some twists. Like I say, this is just another Final Destination sequel.",Final Destination 3
381,cmp23,I thought this movie was Horrible....Ne1 else?,1,14 February 2006,"What I don't understand is why they related this to 911. When they showed all those pictures/proof of how everyone dies, she tosses in some proof of big accidents/events. Why would they show a picture of the plane's shadow on the world Trade towers. Final Destination 1 and 2 didn't relate anything to this. This had no relevance to the plot. Not to mention it goes from plane... Which is pretty scary. Then came a huge car accident still scary but not as good as the first. Then comes a Roller-coaster crash .... ahh runnnnnnnnn!!!!!Was there anyone else laughing at the Tanning scene with the girls screaming? Now if the board was stuck between both handle bars on both machines....Why couldn't one girl just push the board out. Wouldn't the board be pushed farther towards the other girl allowing one of them to escape and save the other. Since when do dull wooden spikes that don't even look sharp, Pierce the skin? Where is a train going to crash other then the wall of a tunnel. Oh yeah and he magically appears out of nowhere on the same train. What a coincidence!! Death must of convinced him to go on the same train at the same time. Who else thought that the liquid leaking from the roller-coaster was fruit punch? That scene with the wind in the trees made me believe that a tree was going to hit them. lol What a waste of seven dollars.",Final Destination 3

383,aquilegia83,just OK,5,11 February 2006,"When I first saw Final Destination, the thing i noticed above all else was the fact that the plot line was original and clever. It was a horror story that didn't just rely on gore and jumpy moments to keep the audience interested. Final Destination 2, although I thought it wouldn't be as good as the original, was brilliant. Again the clever plot was the films greatest asset. The way it linked in with the first one, the outward ripple effect the events of the first film caused, was so intricate and well thought out that I was soon recommending it to everyone I knew who was as sceptical as I had been about it.Sadly, Final Destination 3 did not live up to my expectations. The same storyline occurs - a character has a premonition, this time about a roller-coaster coming off the rails and killing everyone on it, and in a panic saves a few people from the deaths she saw in her mind. And so follows a series of grisly ""freak accident"" deaths for all those who were supposed to have died on the roller-coaster but didn't.The film briefly mentions the events of the previous two episodes, but other than that, it could just be a remake of the first. The story doesn't go any further, there is no new twist on the plot line to intrigue us. This film relies heavily on the gore to keep the audience engrossed with the deaths being a lot more bloody than the previous 2, but sadly, as gory as they are (several people left the cinema because of it), they are highly predictable. There is nothing new or shocking to make it worthy of being part of this trilogy.This is a film aimed at teenagers who are after something with lots of blood and gore. If it's a clever plot line you're after you'll be sadly disappointed and if you're squeamish, stay well away!All in all it was OK. A harmless bit of fun but if you want my advice - wait for the DVD!",Final Destination 3

I went to the cinema not expecting much, for god's sake it's the 3rd film in the series that has got progressively worse. All I can say is I wanted my money back. Simple premise - A handful of badly-acted, stereotypical characters get onto a roller-coaster, it crashes, turns out to be a premonition blah blah blah Although I am the first to admit that the special effects were very good and looked realistic, I am also the first to admit how dreadful the characters are and how they all fit into some category: Beefed-Up Black Guy, Slutty Paris-Hilton style girls, Weird Goth Couple etc. The death sequences were unbelievable and rushed, each character had five seconds of air time before they died and were instantly forgotten. My advice - don't bother",Final Destination 3

Unfortunately at parts of the film I found myself being the only one who was screaming! It is quite a gory film all the way through. Unfotuately the first prediction seemed to be cut short as it all happened too quickly, not giving any clues away.As the film drew closer to half way through, this was where the audience really started to scream. I was slightly disappointed that the film was not in 3D as I think it would have been a lot more frightening.Overall i felt this film was the best one i have seen in a while and i am going to see it again soon for sure.",Final Destination 3

388,XResidentXEvilX,One of the worst Trilogy Ending,1,25 July 2007,"This movie may of in fact used the same formula as the two previous Final Destinations; however, it had NO TIE what-so-ever with the rest of the series. It never explained what had happened to the two survivors from the 2nd movie (only if you payed very close attention to news snippets in the film) The 2nd Final Destination had an ingenious storyline that twisted in w/ the first one about how the survivors of the first film saved the lives of the cast in the second film. This film was just a gore fest for idiots. Gore may of been a factor in the first two Final Destinations; but this one had NO STORY at all and focused more on ways to just kill these kids off, I prove my point with the Interactive Menu selection on how you want to ""Save"" or kill these kids while watching this film on DVD. I'm sorry but what a crap ass way to end a series, this one stunk as bad as Saw III, the only reason why people say these films are good are because they are all gore obsessed no storyline/plot needed. If you're going to watch this film, watch it for pure retarded entertainment, if you want a good plot twist and story, stick to the first two films and just act like this one wasn't even produced",Final Destination 3

For example, when the two girls are in the tanning salon the plank of wood from the shelf which appears to be only 3 to 4 feet long. But when it gets knocked down it somehow grows to perfectly wedge itself between the two tanning beds. (deep breath) but I was almost kinda pleasantly surprised at the ending.

The main female character was a ""wimp"" not a strong lead, like the females in the previous 2. It is obvious to me that this was just a venture to ""cash in"" on movie goers like myself, hoping part 3 would be compelling like the first two. I am extremely disappointed in this film.

392,toolbert,Final Destination 3: More of the same old' Death,3,8 February 2006,"Last night, I was privy to have a viewing of all three final destination films at the Sony Metreon in SF and let me tell you...its really all one film. They may have different titles, but its the same film one after another.Story: The movie, written and directed by James Wong, this movie follows the same formula as the previous two movies. If you don't know the basic plot, it sums down to this: Death has a plan for how we die and one of each film's characters sees a glimpse of that plan and throws it all out of whack by ""cheating"" death. So, in this movie the heroine Wendy, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, has a vision that the roller coaster she's about to go on crashes because of a faulty leak and a broken track. Since she sees this death, before she starts the ride, she and 6 other people, screw up death's plan to have them all die on the ride. Chaos then ensues and we get to watch each person die in a the way of a snuff film. Much like Underworld Evolution, this movie needs bad acting and dialog to get us from one death to the next until we have the ending of the film.Acting: There's only one character that I really liked and that was Ian McKinley, played by Kris Lemche, and even he was a stereotype of a person. All the people who were going to die were just that, stereotypes. From the two bimbos (Ashley and Ashlynn..I didn't make that up) to Frankie and then the goth pair (Ian and his woman), there isn't much acting to be done. All they need to really know how to do is die. Its just that Ian is one of the smarter ones and has some of the better lines in the movie. Of course we don't go to this movie for the acting, now do we? Direction/Overall: James Wong wrote both this one and the first one as well as directed both. Now, the biggest changes he's made is the amount of suspense. The first film did well and wasn't half bad because we and the characters didn't know how they would die. Death was also more...eloquent in how he killed. Now, he's just violent and enacts his revenge in the worst way possible. In the first he was meticulous (think Tod's death with the bathtub), now he just drops things on people, smashes their heads in and uses a nail gun. I really don't know what happened. The franchise changed with the second one from something mysterious into just...well, a snuff film. Bad gimmicks and well used makeup make for a fun movie, but not a very good one. The good, yet bad part about the film is that it doesn't tie back into the first one except for something Ryan Merriman's character Kevin searches on the Internet for information about the deaths. It all ties back through photos as well, but it really didn't need to touch on either film. The ending does need to end a bit earlier than it does. If you liked the other movies, see it. If you are getting a free ticket...maybe go see it. If you don't care about just watching people die and not being scared, stay at home.",Final Destination 3
393,ThunderDragoon,I expected for this movie to be good and guess what...It was!,10,12 April 2006,"This movie is excellent! Final Destination 3 has a very good plot line because it goes in more of an urban legend kind of genre this time. When I first saw this advertised on TV I had goosebumps all over, it looked so good, and I couldn't believe that they had made another. I watched it the day it came out and let's just say it was awesome, in my opinion the best Final Destination yet. The people that they picked for this movie were also good, even though I only knew 2 from other places! Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman were such good actors in this horror/thriller flick. It was just a funny thrill of explosive surprises, and this movie is so good they better not stop here!",Final Destination 3

Her and her friends get off the coaster, and moments later the Roller Coaster does crash. Now each person who got off that coaster begin to die in the exact order they were meant to on the Roller Coaster.The only thing that I slightly thought was a little cartoonish was the Roller Coaster accident. It was still very well done but it felt a little cartoonish to me. But it was a very amazing crash. Other than that, this movie is amazing, with a surprise end! Definitely pick up this film.

Don't get me wrong I loved the second one but it in no way scared me like this one did. I am deathly afraid of rollercoasters so when I saw the beginning of this i was terrified and i did not stop being scared until i walked out of that theater. The death scenes were elaborate. The emotions were undeniable. This one used the essential fears that most people are afraid of and blew them up onto the big screen. As far as gore goes you will not be disappointed. The succulent gore scenes leave nothing to the imagination and will have a hard time being edited for any television channel that isn't unrated. From heads being squished by weight machines and a horrible piercing with a staple gun this movie bleeds into the audience and out into the world. As for the ending it also does not disappoint, at least as long as you are ready to let go of the series. Wendy sees the subway crash a little too late as her friends and the last three survivors of the roller-coaster board and ride to their death.It was an incredible story and ended beautifully which is why I give it 10 out 10",Final Destination 3

That's what makes a great movie. I believe they made a great roller coaster scene that was defiantly smart on their part. I think they should make another final destination movie. It seems like everyone they make they make it better every time. This one i've already watched probably over 5 times. If you haven't seen it yet and love horror movies and like gore then I suggest you see it you won't regret it.

What's so great about this movie is that something like this could actually happen and that's what makes it so eerie and scary and the death sequences are realistic. The only thing I had a problem with was the acting. I mean its great they added fresh faces to the movie screen but they could of found fresh faces with better acting skills (Watch the two valley girl friends in the tanning room.)

This movie was only good because the deaths were so funny, as everyone in the cinema agreed and i've seen both 1 and 2 and when they came out they were very original but now it's just getting boring(for me that is everyone has their own opinion).If you've seen the first 2 i don't think there's any point in going to see the third, but if you haven't seen either of the first 2 i suppose it would be a good movie.",Final Destination 3

She and Kevin (played by Ryan Merriman) tries to warn everyone a lucky few get off cause they think she's nuts but the not so lucky ones including her boyfriend and best friend ( who try to get off but the idiot operator start the ride). The roller-coaster crashes just like she saw in her premonition(the sequence is enough to make you cry.Then the kids from the ride that got off start to die freaky deaths from the tanning booth , the sword slicing, the the nail shots,and the sign that falls to the the ending which i'm not going to say death really ties up lose ends. I don't think there will be another. I don't think James Wong can top that one. I thing that is so messed there is a song that is song about twice about someone being behind you and crap like that.

402,melcany,"For a third installment of a horror flick, a job well done.",9,11 March 2006,"I just recently saw Final Destination 3 and really loved it. In fact, I felt it was the best of the three. What I noticed, is that Final Destination 3 really did an excellent job at keeping up with the cinematic elements of the first Final Destination and adding even more creativity to the deaths we find in Final Destination 2. I think this movie had even better killings than the first two movies. So much, that at the end of the movie I felt unnerved and have promised never to step foot in a tanning salon or think twice before riding a roller coaster. I absolutely loved the explicit violent nature of the ride from hell we see in this movie. It starts with a bang and keeps it going throughout, in my opinion.As with the other two Final Destinations, I love how in this movie there are so many ironic and subliminal messages throughout the movie (i.e., the pictures taken at the amusement park giving off some clue as to which way death was going to get ""even"", Ohio Players ""Love Roller Coaster"" playing in the tanning scene). So clever! This movie was full of surprises and had all the perfect elements of what an audience want from a horror movie. I especially love the Final Destination idea that death is a force, more so than a maniac in a hockey mask, a monster, etc... We all can't cheat death and this movie proves that. It's amazing that death can ""stalk"" the way it does in these movies. Very original and interesting concept! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves a great thrill and wants to walk away feeling a little uneasy and vulnerable.",Final Destination 3
403,kennetht-wong,Not bad if you like FD1,6,20 February 2006,"Story (2 out of 5)  If you watched Final Destination (FD1), then you will know the story of FD3. Nothing special, no big twist (well, I guess there is one half of a ""twist""). The focus of this movie is not the story, but the execution of the story.Acting (2 out of 5)  I watched over 80 movies a year and I can honestly say I don't recognize one, I meant ""ONE"" face from the movie. The actors are all graduated from the ""Scream"" school of acting. Act stupid and able to scream from your lungs and tried to create the highest decibel possible.Directing (3.5 out of 5)  James Wong (Final Destination, The One) returns to direct FD3 after skipping FD2. The result can be seen from the first 10 minutes. The roller coaster tragedy was filmed with the right balance of blood and shock. I rode on the actual roller coaster from the movie before (in Vancouver), and the ride does not look as scary or big as the coaster in the movie. The pace of the movie is fast with very few dull moments. The stereotypes of lead characters in this movie are the same as every other teen flick. The movie (especially the ending) seems like it was picked up from the recycle bin of FD1. Although there is nothing wrong that as FD1 was a little gem in its own right, the originality does get wore off.Overall (3 out of 5)  I don't think Wong intended to make a scary movie, but rather a movie on how many ways you can die horribly without being murdered. There were some very brutal and grotesque deaths, but some that are just plain fun & silly (if one can describe death that way). If you like FD1, then you will definitely enjoy FD3. The novelty is gone, but this movie can still be a thrill ride.",Final Destination 3
404,AmyLeeObsessive,Franchise still going strong!!,9,15 February 2006,"The original Final Destination came out of nowhere in 2000. The plot is about a teenage High School boy who is on board a plane, which is about to set off to Paris. He drifts asleep and has a vision of the plane taking off and exploding mid-air. The vision is so real that he freaks out and warns people of the forthcoming disaster. Only a few take him seriously. Him and a few others are thrown off the plane and witness the explosion from the ground.They are left alive but with the threat of Death itself stalking them. It was a moderately expensive film with a budget of $23 million. It opened to $10 million and finished with $112 worldwide. The movie was a huge hit with teens and adults alike thanks to it's scary plot and unexpected and gory death scenes. It was a terrific film with a memorable script and some believable acting from the teen cast. The sequel came three years later in 2003 and was met with some decidedly mixed reviews. The plot for this one was about a teen girl who has a vision of a huge pile-up. This pile-up produces some devastating results, and when the girl fails to stop the impending carnage she and a group of fellow survivors are left with Death stalking them, hoping to tick them off his list. It wasn't quite as original as the first but was still above average for the genre and was extremely gory. Being a sequel, it was much more Front-Loaded than the original and made $90 million worldwide on about the same budget of the original.Now the third in the series has exactly the same plot as the previous two. This time a High School girl has a vision of a Roller-Coaster accident at a carnival. She manages to get a few people off the ride but the ride sets off before everyone can escape. This film for me, was much more realistic for me. The plane crash in the first, and the pile-up in the second, were very well done and realistic. The image of the Roller Coaster flying off the tracks, however is amazingly frightening, and it represents a fear we all have every time we visit a theme park. Being a second sequel you would think that hanging around waiting for the pretty cast to get killed would be tedious. But the characters are well developed so you actually care when they get offed. The Final Destination series is well-known for having it's young cast killed in extremely inventive ways. This is no exception. The point of the movies is to make you realise that even the smallest thing can kill you. Anyone who is familiar with the series will certainly know this. Buses, Elevators, Nail-Guns, Sun-Beds and Barbecues have all lost their appeal to me.Overall, i really enjoyed this film and i think it is an enormous improvement over the second one.Given that this film has made back its budget on opening weekend alone, we can expect a fourth instalment before too long.",Final Destination 3
405,QueenTripleZero,"FD3 was a great movie! Not as great as FD1, but better than FD2!",8,16 February 2006,"I thought the movie in itself was great, and I am a big fan of the FD series. I didn't feel that this movie fell short, like a few people I have spoken to who have also seen the movie. I know I always get chills whenever I go to ride a roller-coaster, and I got chills when watching the cast stand in line, especially after Wendy began getting a bad vibe from it all.The deaths were somewhat predictable. The tanning deaths especially, but other deaths like Frankie and the car fan, or Lewis and the weights, were, in my mind, very creative. First of all, for poor Frankie, we don't even know if it's him until after we spot the chain he was flashing to Ashley and Ashlynn, and I know I thought the swords were going to chop off Lewis' head.Overall, I loved the movie because it possessed a depth that FD2 didn't have, but it still wasn't as well done as the original. Then again, most things aren't.",Final Destination 3
406,eastshore4,Fear the Reaper,6,15 August 2006,"If there was anything i've been able to take away from the final destination series, it's how with each installment, i learn a little bit more about the good ol' grim reaper. After 3 movies in the series, i've been able to conclude the following 3 things about death: 1) DEATH DOESN'T LIKE SPOILERS. death hates it when people find out what happens at the end (such as say, getting a premonition of your own demise). he can't let a thing like that slide, especially to a group of raucous teenagers, which leads us to our next factoid...2) DEATH IS A REAL ""A-HOLE"". not content with simply cutting your brake lines or smothering you with a pillow, death instead resorts to rube goldberg-like death traps to exact his vengeance. it's obvious that he played ""mouse trap"" as a kid, because every subtle happening is only a part of his complex and overtly bastardly way of off-ing these helpless idiots.3) DEATH HATES HEADS. maybe it's all that pent-up anger from being drawn on millions of angsty teenager's notebooks, or being panned in ""family guy"", but death has a real vendetta against your noggin. if i were to add them up, i'd say over half of the deaths in this series involve something impaling, decapitating, slicing and/or dicing someone's melon. the grim reaper certainly does not know how to get ""a head"" in life. (taps microphone) is this thing on? now for the movie...Although it doesn't really make any strides to improve itself from the previous entries, Final Destination 3 is a pretty good horror flick if you're willing to get over the by-the-book production values. We're stuck with the same premise yet again (teens sidestep imminent death, are thus offed in overly creative and cruel ways), and despite the fact that there's no real enjoyable plot twists or character development, this movie is strangely enjoyable. If you're looking for smart horror, or are on ship with the recent trend of ""gritty"" horror movies such as the ""saw"" series, hostel, etc. then you might be a little more put-off by this flick. but if you're down with the age-old Dimension films premise of innocent (yet pretty) morons biting the dust through clever death traps, then by all means give this movie a shot.i should also note that the DVD is a very interesting product that's worth looking into. the crew did some service to DVD buyers by filming extra scenes and creating a ""choose your own adventure""-esquire option, where you can decide who lives and who dies. certainly gives more incentive to purchasing a DVD than a simple kiss-butt ""interview with cast & crew"".",Final Destination 3
407,ophiuchus1206,Better than I thought it would be......,6,11 February 2006,"Well ...... The worst thing for a scary/horror film could probably be sequels: low budget-new idea horror films which caught everyone's idea always had a way of making a sequel..... And usually, horror sequels always involves: 1)bloodier scenes 2)more CG based grouse/yucky scenes 3)the old idea from the 1st oneI really liked the idea of FD1, Death just come back and finishes the job and there is no way escaping it..... In FD1 .... the horror factor was there and that scares people out because the incidents in not that unrealistic to happen ..... If you are unlucky enough, you may die in that way too ..... remember the guy that caught himself 'hanged' in the bath tub ?? that was scary ..... But when it comes to FD2 ... is just a joke .... same planning, similar idea ..... but this changes the main thing : YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO CHEAT DEATH ..... a new life to beat death ? that s just ridiculous .... And the ways they died in is utterly impossible to happen (Unless you are really really really unlucky enough) So FD2 is pretty bad in my opinion ....Back to FD3 ..... I expected myself to be viewing a bloody / gores film..... but it wasn t that bad .... it switches back to the old idea .. you will never be able to run out Death's plan. Don t whine about is the same old plot ....... you should realise that before you watch the film .... the people that escaped Death the first time just die in horrible ways as it is in the whole FD series .... They die in ways which are too unfortunate to be true .... so the scariness on ''it might really happen in real life'' is erased ... but this is the 3rd in the sequel ... what you expect ?? The film is quite entertaining and well .... worth go seeing it .... but just remember ~ don t expect too much of it ~~ p.s. a hint for those whose haven t watched it yet ...... Try to focus on the first 20 minutes ?? it influenced quite a bit of the rest of the film",Final Destination 3
408,Da_Letter_Jay,Shocking,10,11 February 2006,"I, as a fan of both films, have mixed feelings on FD3. I felt the cast choice was fair, but could have been more diverse. Besides having a near all-white cast, there has only been two blacks (Eugene and Lewis) and one Asian (Perry). This is quite sad as In FD3, Perry had only 1 minute of screen time, almost no dialog, and she was dead seconds after her introduction. Lewis, on the bright side, had a bigger role, but he played a walking stereotype. In fact, his stubbornness lead him to his death. Another concept that the film lacked was the time feel. The movie felt to go by really fast and it did NOT have the closure that I expected it to - especially since it was hailed to be the last in the series ""finishing off what death started"". I basically expected a lot more in the opening sequence, as I was confused at what was going on during the roller coaster scene and the shakiness of it all. The train scene was the same kind of feel, as Julie's death was so quick, that you had to pay close attention to even know it happened. There was almost no reference to the first two films. The concept of pictures foretelling doom was unoriginal, yet the writers made it fit perfectly, but the 9-11 photo to back up the plot was just annoying. Despite all of this, I feel the film was up to my standards and I would pay to see it again. I recommend FD3 to any film-lovers.",Final Destination 3
409,my_lunchbox_thoughts,Better than the first and second,9,12 February 2006,"FD3 held you from the first moments on the roller-coaster, until the very end of it. If you haven't seen it yet, go now. It is better than the first and second. I didn't see an unpleased face in the theater. When you think you know how it will end, you get a nice surprise. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was amazing in her role, she got you into looking for clues. My cousin even loved it, as much as I did. The special effects was more realistic in this one as well. The ending is the best out of the whole movie, in my eyes. So if you decide to go see it, I hope you can pay attention to all the details, they are worth the effort it took to make them.",Final Destination 3
410,cinezombi,Great Catch Phase,5,12 February 2006,In one of the great scenes of the film. The Kevin Fischer seen this man acting out Ben Franklin. Looking for what might kill him. He hears the man quoting Frankins speech about the key and lightning. Kevin Fischer: F*** You! Ben Franklin I caught this film after building it Thursday night.I enjoyed the first two and I thought it has to be better than Pink Panther. I was right about that.It was better than Pink Panther. It was pretty much the same script of the first.Not as good as the second. To agree with the first comment the flight of the truck engine was the most original death. I had ever seen.I love how Hollywood keeps finding new ways to kill folks and keeps the auditoriums packed and people on the edge of there seats.So in the spirit of this delightfully distasteful film. F*** You! Ben Franklin.,Final Destination 3
411,fyreblu_x,Amazingly told!,10,12 February 2006,"So many times a series of movies dies as the stories progress; not the case here! Many a throw back to the first and second movie tie this one in PERFECTLY! The death scenes are great and graphic! I'm a HUGE fan of these movies and this one definitely lived up to the original(s). The concept of catching Death in pictures was a perfect premiers for the film too! Kudos for this one! You've made a Horror buff VERY happy!Subtle things such as casting Tony Todd as the voice of the Devil on the Roller Coaster was PERFECTLY inlaid; his voice is powerful and brash and the fact that he played such an informative character in the first two movies it was only right that he be included here as well. In the beginning of FD1 Alex hears a John Denver song and then hears it being played on a guitar at the end of the movie... that's how he knew something was going to happen again; In this movie Wendy hears a song on the radio (which I'm not familiar with but love) and at the end hears it being played on a guitar in the subway, this is the trigger that showed death was coming around for them again.I definitely recommend that people see this film! It stands alone but works well with the trilogy!",Final Destination 3
412,Allie_House,Best of the three!,9,4 March 2006,"I saw this movie on Valentine's Day and I stand by my opinion that it is the best of the three! The death's are gruesome, but some are even laughable if you see it twice. I think that the premonition scene could've been a little more... traumatic and have more of an impact, but other than that it was good! The thing that is different about this movie is that it focuses around ONLY seniors in high school. The first movie had mostly seniors, but it had the teacher also. The second one had a variety of ages, but this one is only about seniors, which means that the deaths can be somewhat more imaginable, because teens will do certain things that some adults wouldn't. There was a hole in the plot line somewhere along the way, but it wasn't major. All in all, I think this movie was the best of the three, and a good way to end the trilogy of Final Destination. (An oxymoron if there ever was one.) If you haven't seen this movie by now, SEE IT! This is a movie that you would want to see in theaters your first time, not sitting on the couch in your living room, half distracted and not really paying attention. There's a rumor that it will be coming out in 3D eventually, and I loved this movie so much that I want to go see it a second time! So I STRONGLY recommend this movie if you want to be entertained and be scared and grossed out all at once.",Final Destination 3
413,eymeymmyemye,this movie was the bomb...,10,16 February 2006,I love this movie.It's not a waste of time.I could watch it and watch it and never get tired.There were some sad parts like during the funerals.The main character keeps on having visions and at the end she has another one but it doesn't show if everybody dies or one survives.It was very nasty and full of blood.I love those types of movies so i enjoyed.If you like number one then you'll love this one but number one is still better because it's the first.I didn't like number two that much because it was kind of boring.I was never bored watching number three because it kept you on the edge of your seat.I give this movie ten stars because it's the best horror movie i've seen all year.,Final Destination 3

415,shee_lor_1990,A terrible roller coaster accident causes the survivors to die.,1,21 February 2006,"Finally another sequel to one of the worst films ever made. Final Destination series always seems to have a horrible cast and terrible script with average special effects. I am embarrassed that such movies as Final Destination can have two sequels that gets more pathetic each time. ""Final Destination 3"" opening sequence starts off with a group of teenagers enjoying their time at an amusement park. A girl named Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) starts taking pictures of her friends and see small signs of death almost everywhere in the amusement park. She went hysterical when she saw a vision of her friends and her dying from an accident on a roller coaster. This is the part I got very confused. In her vision the accident was caused by a man dropping a camcorder onto the tracks of the roller coaster, but in reality he got off the roller coaster already. So I am left with an unanswered question. Who causes the deaths on the coaster when the person who supposedly causes the deaths got off already.As the movie progressed further I have more questions that are unanswered. The movie kills the suspense by showing how the next person is going die and add boredom towards every death scene. This film is terrible and I highly do not recommend this movie to anyone except hardcore Final Destination fans.",Final Destination 3
416,miss_looloo,this is an amazing film!!!!!!!!,9,19 February 2006,I absolutely love this film it is amazing! i would definitely recommend this to anyone who is in to death and blood and gore.The plot is SO good!!!!! The deaths are well thought of and aren't plain and boring there is an air of excitement to each death. Also for each death there is a bit of mystery and comedy!!the best death is the one with Louis and he thinks that he has cheated death when the swords swing down and miss him but then (as he is in the gym) he lifts up the weights and the they swing down and crush his skull it is SO funny!!! there are loads of other brilliant deaths but you will have to go see the film to see what they are!!!i hope you enjoy the film as much as i did!,Final Destination 3

I think that this film was quite gory in the fact that nothing was shown off screen. the audience could see everything! It was brilliant. definitely a big hit in the UK! I will definitely be buying this film when it comes out on DVD and i will be recommending it to all of my friends and family great job to everyone involved in the production of it. all of the actors in the film played their parts really well and the director has made the film one of those that i will not easily forget in a long while. there were parts where tension built up so heavily the atmosphere in the cinema could have been cut with a knife. it it really that tense. everyone was sat on the edge of their seats, not knowing whether to scream with amazement or fright. BRILLIANT!",Final Destination 3
418,brunette_bimbo_1992,It's Really Good!!,10,24 February 2006,Final Destination 3 is the best film around at the moment. I wouldn't watch it if you haven't seen the first 2 though or you might not understand it. I think it is better then the first 2 put together. I watched the 3rd one then the 1st one and you can really tell which is the more advanced with a better story line. I also wouldn't watch it on your own or if you are the slightest bit squeamish. Plus don't watch it if you suffer from paranoia because i got a bit paranoid when it was over. But it is very good with the best storyline yet. It has some funny parts too and one of the characters is very funny and cheeky. Please do watch it because it is really great!!,Final Destination 3

They try to put a little bit of a spin on it, but I thought it still was good (my friend didn't like the pictures as clues)... Anyway, it really was surprising how they (still) got me to scream and yell. Oh and they did add even more gore and bizarre ways to die. After the plate of glass squishing the boy in the 2nd one, I didn't think a squish scene would get me, but, well, let's just say I was dead wrong. Still trying to shake the image...I literally still have knots in my stomach, I'm not even joking. The anxiety from the moment they got on the roller coaster, to well, the end of the movie, it was just non-stop ""Holy Sh!t!""

420,nickersonpower,Final Destination 3 review,6,25 February 2006,"If you are expecting the logic and plot twists of the original Final Destination, then you'll be disappointed. If you didn't understand it first time around then don't worry - mental acuity is not required to thoroughly enjoy the third instalment. The idea of a roller-coaster disaster was genius. In the first film the aeroplane explosion was also ideal, because many people don't like flying and the scenario was claustrophobic and suspenseful. The pile-up in the second film was, quite frankly, dull. It was no different to the sorts of things shown in ER/Casualty and was very predictable. However a roller-coaster ride - well, there are so many things that could go wrong - was a brilliant start to the movie. Cue lots of gory, imaginative and disturbingly detailed deaths that will have you wearing full body armour for several days afterwards. The characters evoke a credible amount of sympathy/irritation and there are some you will be hoping will die next. Wendy is suitably unhinged (shades of Clear Rivers from the first two in the franchise). For some the lack of complicated plot lines will be a letdown, for others a blessing. The film is let down slightly by a sudden ending but genre fans will be wholly satisfied (the source of quality horror movies is running dry), though you'll never use sunbeds again.",Final Destination 3
421,ShootEmUp,Better than expected,8,18 March 2006,"When I saw the original trailer, I thought this film would be a cheesy sequel to the excellent first 2. But I was wrong. This film had everything expected from a Final Destination film, and the most obvious were the great deaths. They were all really gory but at the same time, well planned out. The roller-coaster scene was thrilling and exciting, but maybe could be a little more detailed, as we didn't see that much gore. Even the acting was very good for a horror film. The ending was also good, although I won't ruin anything. Out of the 3, this is the second best in the series. The only problem is, its a little short and we barely got to know most of the characters. But the overall idea is good and the film is a worthy sequel, seeing as most '3rd in the series' films suck.",Final Destination 3
422,ersats,Quite good,8,16 March 2006,"In my opinion it so desperately follows the sequel of the other two movies. You cannot keep up with it unless you've watched the others. Except for that I think that the deaths are horrible. Having watched the previous ones you know what is going to happen and you have nothing but to wait for it to do so. The way the deaths happen is the only surprise, but still make you gasp!!! You reach a point when you don't know what to expect! However I quite fancy the idea of the concept, someone having the intuition of their death therefore I vote for 8. I have to admit though that the first one still remains the best since it has the advantage of being innovative!",Final Destination 3
423,AmericanDreamz,"Whoa, awesome",10,16 July 2006,"Okay, so I admit that I only went to see this movie because of the stunning Canadian actress/singer Alexz Johnson, but walked in to so much more than just that (even though Alexz IS a GREAT singer and actress). The movie is a ride of thrills, chills and awe. Some death scenes you cheer for more, and others just make you cringe and go ""Ooohh"". Although, if you do not like gore, it won't be good for you, but if you do, watch it! There are some unexpected twists and shocks near the end. Also, there are some laughs along the way. The only disappointment is the characters. Most are cliché. But that's what makes the deaths so good, so that doesn't bring the film down at all. And with the cliché's, it may be better for some because there is a character everyone can relate to/like, even if some do not get as much story as others (read the book if you really want more info on characters)...If you want a film that you don't need to take seriously, and just want to sit back and have fun with, this is the movie you need to see.

425,crazykeanefreak,Disappointingly Depressing,4,13 February 2007,"The first film is the backbone of the franchise, with the explanations to Death's motives. The second film is the popcorn flick, which builds on the ideas of the first and pumps it up to 11. These leaves the latest one, which returns to the pshycological roots of the first, with the same director. As valiant as this premise is, I don't feel that the series really needed it. I feel that the second film is the best, due to it's understanding of the genre, and its exploitation of it. Here, we the bar is lowered to the point of depressing, going back to more complicated reasonings to Death's lust for revenge. Everything's mentioned here, from how Death sees everyone as equal to his ghostly presence, but so much is mentioned that the crew have forgotten WHY this film isn't on DTV the moment: the deaths. As good as they are here, they serve as methods of keeping awake in the film instead of the moments where we all whoop with joy. In fact, these are all far more weaker than before, without any real satisfaction in watching the teenagers come to their demise. The coincidences are all here, and are more stringed out than before, which sadly leads to the average teen probably shouting 'Get On With It' as apposed to the tension. Thanks to the photographs showing us how the people die, we can see a mile what's going to happen, and we end up waiting long and hard for our thoughts to be confirmed (notably the nail-gun death). As to make matters worse, although not trying to spoil anything, the ending is also the worst, without the same feeling the others brought on us.",Final Destination 3

The first death we see after the roller-coaster are Ashley(Chelan Simmons)and Ashlyn(Crystal Lowe) at the tanning salon. There are certainly at least 5 things that make no sens at all...First, the fact that there's only one guy working in the tanning salon and he's not even paying attention to what's happening in the store... there are safety rules that prohibit the fact that there's nobody watching the tanning machinesSecond, the simple way that the tanning salon is built, it doesn't respect any regulations at all, the room size it at least two times smaller that it should be because tanning machine require more space than that... there's also the small wall at the end of the tanning machine, at no point there should be a small wall there... It prevent air circulation and it would also make the machine overheatThird, there's no way that there could be any coat hanger inside the tanning room, there are changing rooms for that...Fourth, on every tanning bed, there's a panic button that shuts the session automatically, and furthermore, there's also a security protocol inside the machine to prevent the UV lights to generate too much rays, if they do, the machine stops automatically.And the last and most important one of all, its impossible to cook in a tanning bed, myth busters proved it, the most that can happen is you will cook your skin and die from secondary effects not from the heat.So as you can see, using only the first death as example, you can see that there are a lot of things that you shouldn't believe in those movies, all those deaths are not plausible...",Final Destination 3
431,mouhab_m-1,Repeated Movie,2,17 July 2006,"It was so repeated movie, it has nothing different than the previous two parts! It's exactly the same idea, someone sees a premonition, some people are saved, and then they die later! There is nothing new in this Movie. Well, the ways they died were new, but what is the point of making a movie to show me a different ways of dying ??!! The first part was the best cause it was something new, but making a third part of the movie? That didn't add anything to the title, i will only remember the first part, the third part has the same idea, the same sequence of events only the actors were different. In my opinion it was repeated and boring movie .",Final Destination 3
432,Tothewashroom,Superb! A Great Edition To The Final Destination Saga...,10,29 July 2006,"I am a MASSIVE fan of the entire Final Destination Movies. I've read many of the comments and several of them seem to have a weird idea that the saga gets weaker as it goes on, oh come on, nothing I have ever heard in my whole entire life could possibly be any farther from the truth. Honest to God, these movies are like great rollercoster. From the bat they shoot off into a fast pasted heart thumping entertainment flick, and as the more movies come out the ride speeds up and adds a few perfect spins and loops and with no sign of slowing down this perfect addition comes out.When I watched this movie in the theatres every death got either screams, retches or YES! from the audience...this movie is the, without a doubt, perfect movie for an average teenager to see, plenty of violence, death, gore, fist fights, and nudity thrown in, granted the nudity does not concern you about, oh, 2 minutes into the scene, that there is only one way to describe not only the first movie, not only the second movie, not even the two combined, a blockbuster classic. What else can you expect from a movie which the idea is so blantly original in a world full of lame teeny kill, phsyco killer, horror flicks. It stands out in my mind to be a pillar in the horror/thriller genre...",Final Destination 3
433,jazza_rulz56,Very entertaining,9,17 December 2008,"Final Destination was one of the best teen horror films of the 2000's. It had a VERY original plot, good suspense, above average acting, and decent gore while not too over the top. The second film was also very good but didn't really add anything new to the story.Now, the third film in the series, while not as good as the first, surpasses the second film. In this one, A group of high school seniors are at a celebratory carnival. You have all your stereotypical teens here: The stuck up jock, the attractive bimbos, the pervert, the cynical emos, etc. They all go on a roller-coaster and Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a premonition of it crashing and killing everyone on it in horrific, gloriously over the top ways. Just before the ride starts, she freaks out and gets a group of others kicked off the ride along with herself, just before it crashes. Now Death comes after the survivors and begins killing them in elaborate, gory ways.It is a lot like the others in that way, but something new that they added was that pictures Wendy took have clues to how the people who survived the crash will meet their fate.Speaking of the deaths, they were awesome! They came up with some good places to kill people and it really makes you be wary when you go into the places the deaths occurred such as a tanning salon or a hardware store. The gore has definitely been increased a notch since the other two and that can only be a good thing as far as i'm concerned. Not too much characterization but it wasn't really needed because we more or less only see this franchise to see the ways the people die and this one definitely didn't disappoint in that aspect.Overall, this a very good sequel and you should definitely check it out if you liked the first two films.9/10",Final Destination 3
434,mystiquepurple,Final Destination 3 Its awesome!!,9,12 July 2006,this movie its the best movie i've seen lately if u like the last 2 this on you will enjoy deeply as scary and thrilling as the other ones and lots of surprises i recommend it!! This movie has various special effects that will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will want to see it over and over again. This movie its scary somehow its a new wave of terror and mysterious luck that goes within the characters. The best part of the movie its that you can still like it even if you have not seen the other ones it has its own story and if you are a fan of movies that are different from the usual horror flicks this one its going to have many things that you might enjoy and actually love throughout the movie its shows you many new characters that have their own faith and etc.,Final Destination 3
435,siobhandug,Thoroughly average and quite disappointing,5,25 July 2006,"I actually found this film to be quite disappointing. Firstly, it was quite short and secondly, I felt that the plot wasn't nearly as clever as the first two. Instead, they tended to focus more on making the death scenes as gruesome as possible, with very little surprise element. People will obviously flock to see this film because it's living on the good name of the first two, but overall, it's thoroughly mediocre and not up to the usual ""Final Destination"" standard!Also, I don't know if it was a problem with the DVD player or the film, but the entire thing was in a nasty green colour.. is this suppose to happen? I definitely wont be adding this DVD to my home collection!",Final Destination 3
436,StormChaser88,"Great Movie, maybe a Final Destination 4?",9,26 July 2006,"I was not really looking forward to watching Final Destination 3, because the reviews weren't all that good. I was pleasantly surprised because it was up to my expectations. The first two movies were good thinking pictures and some bloody, gory fun. The third was the same; Final Destination 2 might have been bloodier, but it was an altogether good movie with an ending just as up in the air as the first two films. I know Final Destination 4 isn't in production yet, but it wouldn't surprise me to see it later on down the road and yes I will go watch it when it comes out.Greg...",Final Destination 3
437,OrangeInTheEvening,Losing the Plot,2,30 July 2006,"The original final destination was an above average teen horror movie, with an original concept. Despite my low expectations, it proved to be scary, unpredictable and darkly humorous; and it inevitably started a franchise. Final Destination 2 begins well, but eventually becomes convoluted when it attempts to link everything back to the characters and events of the original movie. I had hoped that Final Destination 3 would prove to be a better sequel, or at least be entertaining, but I was once again disappointed. The characters are blander than ever, with the exception of Kris Lemche, whose character provides the only interesting twist in this movie - that death's design could involve one survivor killing another surviver in an attempt to break the cycle. Aside from this, FD3 offers the most misfiring death scenes of the series. They are either too brief, too implausible or, in the case of the sunbed deaths, just plain disgusting. Death's revenge scenes have none of the sick and gleeful slow build and preparation than we saw in the school teacher's death in FD1. I am aware that the death scenes may seem trivial, but all Final Destination 3 seems to offer is a series of such scenes strung together by hackneyed dialogue which has all been said before in better ways in the previous movies. The second premonition, of the train crash, towards the end of the film, interested me at first, and could have been developed much more. However, the film chooses to end here abruptly, creating a highly unsatisfactory conclusion which leaves you feeling cheated. I wouldn't have minded the shoddiness of the film if it were at least entertaining, but it takes itself too seriously, and cannot even suffice as a crowd-pleasing popcorn teen horror. The only consolation that I took from this movie is that the creators are running out of means of transport which can explode/fail. They've done plane; car; roller-coaster and train - hopefully they won't resort to boat a la Speed 2 to make a fourth movie.",Final Destination 3

439,kvintner,shame,2,3 August 2006,"(Warning bad review)I went to the cinema to see final destination 3 full of excitement for the gory delights that awaited me,but sadly after about 30 minutes i had to walk out for the gory horror flick i had been longing to see had for some reason turned into a low budget porno. I'm talking about the scene in the tanning salon with the girls/actresses that have no respect for themselves ,i mean come on guys the whole boob thing has been done it's boring it's repetitive it's lame and dear god didn't that scene dragged on! i mean i sat there for at least 5 minutes before i decided to leave.In final destination 1 there was no nudity and the film was a massive success,in the second movie there was a bit of smut but nothing major and again a success but this one, congratulations Mr Director you have successfully managed to ruin what could have been a fantastic trilogy. Due to the nudity and animal cruelty content in this film i feel that going to see this movie was a complete waste of my time and money and if there is anyone else out there that feels the same way i do which i'm sure there is don't go to see this movie save your time and your money it's rubbish.A.DINGLEY",Final Destination 3

Further later her Preminition then they start going one-by-one.

442,GoBrooke_Yourself,Good Effort,5,23 November 2006,"I really wanted to see this film because one of my friends had said it was really good, so i burrowed the DVD straight away. It started out good, we got a idea of some of the main characters although it is the same kind of characters, sensible main character, caring boyfriend, best friend, insensitive best friends boyfriend, annoying and rude younger sister, etc etc, but none the less we get a good view of these people. The action starts pretty much straight away and it will have you hooked on your seat and even hiding behind a pillow. So after such a good pillow it was a big disappointment when the whole plot just seemed to go downhill. After a death involving tanning beds, the rest just seem very rushed and pretty much average, nothing very creative. We start to lose our identification with the two main characters, Wendy just doesn't seem to have much of a personality, she just seems kinda dull. Kevin the second main character and the insensitive guy in the beginning now is a kind, sensitive kinda person??. I do think its worth seeing but the effort was kinda weak",Final Destination 3

RENT THIS DVD.Some may think this is funny and stuff but it's more than that. Yeah, it does take itself seriously.. that's what good movies do. It's not ""supposed to be"" anything other than what the director goes for. It does have its 'teen moments' but if you look closer the whole thing goes further than you might at first notice. The acting is good, the art direction, sound and music are all great too. I think this is the best of the series.. better than 1 or 2 by far, and far better than 4 will be.. though a guy can hope. This is definitely not a film for everyone, but we all have our niche. It is more than a dumb teen movie. It is a teen movie, yeah to a point, but not dumb. Oh yeah, to all you retards! The movie is not about death so much as FATE. Death is their fate, that's all. The camera being on the tracks or not, is not important.

445,robspit,Ends with as much action as it begins,9,4 August 2006,"This installment ends with as much action as it begins, which was a welcome change of pace from the first two in the series. The ""Change Their Fate"" feature integrates some alternate scenes within the movie itself, rather than just having various disconnected ""Deleted and Extended Scenes"" separately under ""Special Features"" as with most DVDs. In several cases (with the notable exception of the tanning salon scenes), the alternate version is _shorter_ than the the ones in the uninterrupted playback, so you're not going to miss much if you only have time to watch it once, straight through. It seems more work went into the special features than most DVDs, so fill out the online survey if you'd like to see more DVDs produced with that level of effort.",Final Destination 3

And for u blood and gore fans, This movie had a lot of blood and gore too. the premonition was totally freaky and definitely convinced me not ever to do this again. to know what Im talking about watch the movie premonition. And if u haven't watched Final Destination 1 or 2, then I strongly recommend that u watch it. Because it wont make as much sense. after all it is a trilogy. The ending kind of bummed me out, just didn't see it coming. But rather else everything was great the deaths, the suspense, and the acting was pretty good. So I gave it 9 stars!!

And yeah, I'm a bit more paranoid, now.Some of the deaths were a bit obvious, like the other two Final Destination movies, but some were just like, ""Woah!"". I did however, expect there to be a few more deaths in this movie than there were. Granted, all the deaths were quite gory and full of blood, but there weren't really enough deaths.I'm a big fan of the other Final Destination movies, and this movie is no exception. The scenes are so real! Well, to me they are, anyway. :] The ending shocked me in two ways. One, the fact that it's the first time the main character has had another premonition; although, I think it's a bit weird they're all on the train together without meaning it. I loved the way the main character ends up dying though.. >:] And second, it's freaky because I had a dream just before Final Destination 3 came out about a Final Destination 3 type-thing. The dream was so real, and it included a roller-coaster and train crash! It actually ended with 3 people that seemed so familiar dying in the train crash. Brr.. Psychic ability?

Although it was a little different from the first two movies in this series, that I believe is what made its success.It is common for people to be bored with movies that never change and get old extremely fast. Final Destination 3 did the complete opposite for me. The gore was pretty extreme and the death scenes more elaborate. The suspense was simply wonderful. From the very beginning to the end, I was on the edge of my seat.I really enjoyed playing 'Clue' with the characters as they scrambled to find out what each of their fates would be, based on their pictures at the amusement park. It gave me a chance to try and predict the movie, even though I ended up being wrong, anyway.Creating paranoia was one of the keys to making this movie great.

I adore the films but they need the following to happen: accident = train wreck( I heard this from a friend. She said that was going to be the ""accident"" for the next film), death : a person is driving on a road & the opposite car runs over a piece of rusty metal & it flies and hits the driver in the head.

452,BrotherDragon,"Lazy, unimaginative and devoid of redeeming qualities",1,27 July 2006,"I'm sorry, but let's just be honest here. The Final Destination series has never been synonymous with quality but there's always been some primal fun hidden within the films, some sick voyeuristic pleasure at watching others horrible fates unfold before your very eyes. Final Destination 3 removes any of this fun in exchange for a convoluted plot that's desperately trying to be clever and relevant but ends up being trite and bland. Characters are 2-dimensional cut-out stereotypes and the acting's even worse than the dialogue, the film lacks impetus and drive to hook the viewer and suffers from the get-go (the roller-coaster scene's a perfect example of a good idea poorly executed... pardon the pun). What could have been another simple but enjoyable film of intriguing deaths with a little ominous mystery is nothing but bad comic book dialogue and TV-show like direction (the guys came off of the X-Files and it looks as though their skills have taken a step backwards).If you want to see what Morgan and Wong are truly capable of check their run on X-Files or, better yet, the brilliant Willard...

The use of photos as the precepts to deaths worked well.I found the previous FD's more violent, that is why it was originally rated M in Australia. Although it was predictable to an extent as they all are it was still creative and differed from the first two approaches. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman worked well together and are brilliant actors. The directors were excellent and helped move the film smoothly. Unfortunately, recently a film critic rated it as one of the top 10 worst films of 2006, which I disagree.",Final Destination 3
454,xemma_nicholsx,My review of Final Destination 3,7,7 January 2007,"Final Destination 3 is like the roller coaster featured prominently at the beginning of the film -- a thrill ride we all know the destination and boundaries of, and whatever fun we extract from it comes through the experience of it.On the death following the initial accident,ironically the song 'Love Roller-coaster' plays while the characters seem to have a huge lack of grief or shock for the mayhem which surrounds them. The key is not to take this movie seriously but to actually have a lot of fun with it. The dialogue, similarly to Final Destination 1&2, is still cheesy and there still isn't a character amongst them to care about; but the unusual and unexpected death ideas are sure to have you sitting there with your hand over your mouth! Although the plot may be simple and predictable, you have to give the movie credit for its unique way of including as much gore as possible as the characters die, rather than just focusing on the pure horror aspect of it. For example: as the two high school princess' slowly sizzle to death trapped in fake tan booths. - who would have expected that? it may be humorous but its extremely clever and enough to make the audience want to curl up into a ball of safety!The film even includes the final girl theory (a trait that every good horror movie should have) as Wendy's both the character thats most susceptible to death while she receives terrifying visions of what the future has in store for her if she step onto the roller-coaster, and yet she could be seen as the strongest character because she has the knowledge that could prevent other peoples deaths before they happen.Final Destination 3 is a great horror movie and as the original creators promised, its bound to provide you with the 'ride of your life'.",Final Destination 3

It was a bit confusing and the people are just seen falling from the roller-coaster. There was one scene where a pipe tube/track hits someone, but its not really shown and it happens too quick.I expected the cars to fly off the tracks and into a crowd.Other than that, there were about three ""good"" accidents in the film.I thought the hardware store accident had the best visual of the chain of events that cause the accident.I still feel that the 2nd film was the best in the series.",Final Destination 3
457,amarakin,FD3 'Kills' First Two in Series.,6,18 December 2007,"As a fan of the Final Destination series, I was anxious about seeing this film; I mean, really, how many times can we 'almost cheat death'....? After, though, I was amazed. True, the deaths aren't as drawn out or suspenseful as the first two films, but they definitely don't leave you unsatisfied! In the last two films, the audience only really sees the aftermath of the deaths, but in this one you get the whole shebang.Mary Elizabeth Winstead does an EXCELLENT job as Wendy, the lead. She was not nearly as annoying as the lead in FD2. I liked how the pictures showed the deaths, and they weren't just pulling random facts out of thin air, like in the last two (i.e, the 'hookman' clue the stoner sees in FD2). I was sitting around, trying to figure out the pictures, too. In the previous installments, they get a clue right when the death happens. There's really not much to prevent it, but in this one, it's right there, in front of her face, and it had been since that night!The tanning bed death TERRIFIED me, freaking TERRIFIED me. I don't tan, but I'm claustrophobic, and being locked in burning hell-box of death? Yeah, not fun to think about, although the nudity didn't really add anything to the film. It was just for pre-teen/teenage/full grown fanboys. Frankie's death was so quick, so out-of-the-blue, and so graphic that I thought I was going to throw-up. It was still enjoyable, though, and probably one of the most unexpected deaths in the film. I have to say that I was kind of glad to see Lewis go; he was annoying and arrogant for thinking that he, a mere mortal and no Olympian, could escape Death. His death was pretty obvious, though... I have to say that I almost cried when Erin died. I'm partial to the Goths, and her death was sad, extremely unexpected, and, well.....disgusting. Perry's (the Asian girl that was next to Julie (Amanda Crew) on the ride, and didn't have a single line the entire film) death was brutal. ""Who was next to you on the roller-coaster, Julie?! You have to tell me!"" Julie's just sobbing away, and Perry gets this distressed look on her face, stands, and is immediately impaled with a flag from the Tricentenial situation. Freaking brutal. I was a little glad to see Ian go, too, because he was deranged after Erin's death and as annoying as Lewis, although it would've been nice to see him played out as Death's pawn in Wendy's death.Kevin's character really did nothing, but it didn't take away from my ability to enjoy the film. I'm glad that he and Wendy never had some profound 'I love you' moment. That was one of THE most annoying things about the first film, how Clear started calling Alex 'baby' five minutes in to the movie, when they'd never spoken before in their lives. I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting, but it never happened in this movie. Can I get a hallelujah?I liked the end, too, because it really left no set up for a fourth film, even though they'll probably milk the franchise and make another one anyway...",Final Destination 3

459,dube01,Can death be cheated,8,16 July 2008,"Final Destination 3 shows that no one can escape death as it has a pattern for everyone and no one can cheat it. The movie shows does not like losing victims because Mary Elizabeth Winstead and her friends survive from the near death experience but death is still after them as they begin to die one by one. All the fears of riding a roller coaster are exploited in the accident that makes up the opening salvo for what is to come. A group of seven people avoid a fatal catastrophe because Mary felt the impending danger and pulled the others from the situation that would have caused their lives to come to an end. All the people who were left behind die in the catastrophe however; those who got off and survived have not really been spared as they will learn that death is still pursing them. Death was proving that it was not meant to be cheated, and the people that survived were meant to die, and it would have to happen soon. The catastrophic accident is a roller coaster ride that will be doomed, and the movie is just horrifying. Before getting on the roller coaster Emily seems to be in fear, the mood is tense and the wind is blowing hard. Death is all around the people on the doomed roller coaster as the bolts come loose, hydraulics start leaking, roller coaster wires and cables snaps, roller coaster wheels come loose and are everywhere, the track twists and separates. While all this is happening people are screaming in fear for their lives this scene is just horrifying. In the beginning, the screams are the sounds people make on amusement park rides as they would be enjoying the thrill of the rides, and then they turn terrifyingly real as something bad would have gone terribly wrong.The theme of Final Destination 3 shows that death is all around us. The title of the movie shows that death is the final destination of our lives and thereby supporting the theme. No matter what we do to preserve life, death will always be out to get us and death cannot be cheated. The importance of the theme proves that people should not live their lives in fear because no matter what we do to prevent death there will come a time when everyone has to face their death.",Final Destination 3
460,DemonPunkPrincess,awesome movie :),10,7 May 2009,"The movie was at least equal to FD1 & FD2. I love that they had high school seniors because,it's like, they could grow to be so much. They probably had plans, Wendy seemed to. Ian and Erin don't really show any affection,aside from being by each other constantly. I love how unique they are,like Ian's the guy who questions EVERYTHING nobody else has the guts to. Erin's the girl everyone would love to hate, but can't help respecting. Overall the movie was incredible,it got me into Kris Lemche :)I would probably not have watched if Vanessa Hudgens had gotten the part she wanted, so the cast was one of the main things that had an effect in the film. I suggest people at least give the film a watch. I mean, who doesn't love to see the school's egotistic bully get his head smashed?",Final Destination 3
461,vj_parker,FD3 is great,8,23 May 2006,"I really liked Final Destination 3. I thought it was more creative than the first two. The deaths were more unexpected. The one thing I didn't like about the move was the roller-coaster crash. Everything that happens is shown in the crash during the premonition just like in the first two movies. But, in the third movie, after the kids are hauled off the roller-coaster, we just hear the crash and screaming. We don't see what is actually happening. So, I found that a little disappointing. Overall, though, I would have to say that this is a great suspenseful movie and I would recommend that everyone should see it.",Final Destination 3
462,slurpeefreak450,"Great Movie, although it seems rushed...",7,12 February 2006,"I just saw this last night and let me tell you, Final Destination fans will not be disappointed! I really enjoyed the parts that weren't death scenes because they were still interesting. I also liked the roller coaster scene it wasn't too over the top and remained realistic. As far as the deaths go, they were very creative. The gore level is very high and I would say the same as FD2. The only problem was it seemed a bit rushed to me. There wasn't enough space between the death scenes but I guess they did that to keep inpatient people's attention. Without giving anything away, I'd have to say the tanning bed incident has to be the most explicit and creative death. There's a huge body count here and I'm sure that it will quench anyones gore/horror craving.",Final Destination 3

I liked the movie generally, but there seems to be a glaring hole in the plot which potentially destroys the whole story.As always, the movie revolves around avoiding fate (as long as you can ;-) and trying to find clues to help you live just a little bit longer. The problem is with the pictures.Wendy(?) took the pictures *before* they had avoided their fate and the pictures showed clues as to how they would die *after* they had *avoided their fates*.Therefore, fate knew that they would avoid what it planned for them...therefore they were actually doing what fate planned? Aaargh! Either I'm too smart...or too dumb. ;-)",Final Destination 3
464,isis237,Imagine if the Sci-Fi channel teamed-up with your local high-school drama-club . . .,1,19 February 2006,"For horror film enthusiasts, Final Destination and Final Destination II were a pleasant surprise. The original film presented a youthful but talented cast. It also offered a remarkably original premise injected with a bit of dark humor. Quite a treat! Moreover, while Final Destination II had a thinner plot, the technical effects were completely unexpected -- utterly groundbreaking. The mature casting granted the film an interesting sense of plausibility. So phenomenal a visual-spectacle is the second installment of this film that I shared it with my film class! Onto Final Destination 3. Not only are the actors ridiculously inexperienced (this is the first foray into acting for some), they seem to be utterly unaware of their less-than-mediocre talents. This is not a problem of editing, this a serious problem with casting. These actors literally have their foundation in television-acting (check the bios) ... and we are talking bad, bad cable acting (or the WB). The talent is so heinous that you hope for these actors deaths. The problem: the deaths lack creativity. The first two installments of this franchise used viewer-misdirection to shock its audience with appalling death-scenes. In this instance, the deaths are both predictable and obvious. A tremendous disappointment, indeed.And, for those Final Destination fans who think they are going to see a slightly dumbed-down echo of the first two films. ... think REALLY dumbed-down. The grotesque caricatures of teens, the ridiculously vulgar humor, the gratuitous nudity, and the excruciating writing was shocking. It is unusual to see a director deliberately ignore a film's cult-following. Not only did the director ignore the intended audience for the film, but Wong insulted that audience.For all horror enthusiasts: be prepared to leave the film angry (the SLOPPY, SLOPPY conclusion only contributes to the desire for a refund.) Trust me. This is not Final Destination 3 . . . This is Friday the Thirteenth Part 40 . . . it is base, it is amateurish, and it is an utter disgrace.",Final Destination 3
465,zohar2-1,Major flaws in plot! (spoiler warning),7,11 February 2006,"Unlike the first two movies in this series, which were well thought, this one has some major flaws in the details. If the guy that mainly caused the roller-coaster crush with his video camera got off the ride because of the warning, how did the accident occur? later when his own death arrives, and already after the main character found the connection to the pictures, why was it only AFTER his death that she realized that there was another picture of him in the set? If I knew there were clues in those pictures about future deaths, I would have gone over them a thousand times. Same goes with the almost too late discovery about her sister. And one last thing - didn't we learn in the last two movies that ""intervention"" can not come from the subject of death themselves but only from an outside, accidental source? So how come a simple ""push"" can be considered ""intervention""??? The spooky black guy in the morgue was obviously missing to provide explanations. So was the total ignoring of the ""reverse"" death pattern of the second movie. The deaths were also much quicker - not giving the audience the main thrill of the first two movies - to see so many things go wrong, but not knowing what will be the actual cause of death until the last second. It was a fun movie, but with major flaws in the plot. With just a little more thought and attention to the details, this could have been a much better movie. Unfortunately - it wasn't so. While the first two moview were about ""WHY"" is death acting this way, and ""HOW is it behaving"" (""What is the pattern""), this one had nothing new to tell us about the pattern, but only about ""HOW"" will the death happen (what will be the cause of death). While in the first two the main character was always too late to warn the victims, in here she was practically there with almost all of them when it happens, and still failed to save them. I agree that the end was nice, but do not even try to tell me that they are suppose to die in the end. After all, she DID do something different from the premenision by pulling the ""Emergency Stop"" string. All in all - if someone HAS to see this movie, watch it before the second one. Since it is only in the second one that we actually learn new things about death. (The second one was much better as far as tying up the plot)",Final Destination 3
466,kelthebrave,Does not try to be anything more than it is!!!,10,25 February 2006,"You gotta admire a film like this. Plot is original to say the least and even though there are many holes in this trilogy the ingenious deaths and roller-coaster crashes sure make up for it. The roller-coaster scene is worth your money alone and is a frightening scene to watch. This is a lot faster paced than the other two in my opinion, and why not? i mean once the main characters discover what is going on then why shouldn't the deaths keep coming and coming. After all thats what attracts a lot of people to this trilogy, the random ways in which people can die. This film will make you think twice about using a tanning bed though, but hey getting a nice tan never hurt anyone!!!...much :-)Go see this film yourselfs and make you own opinions",Final Destination 3

468,timewellwasted,A group of teens cheat death and death comes after them,6,22 February 2006,This movie on it's own is a very interesting and keeps you hooked into the action. Final Destination 3 has some good new aspects from the previous 2. What I liked about Final Destination 2 is the unique way that the first and second were tied together. It was more than just mention flight 180 but the deaths were linked to the original survivors. The fact that they linked it only a little bit turned me off.the unique death scenarios were pretty good but after what they did in Final Destination 2 it just wasn't as good. I think the effects were done better in the 2nd movie.I recommend seeing this. It's not a bad movie it's just that it should of been a stand alone move rather then the end of a trilogy.,Final Destination 3

After all, all they do is complain. The creativity seems to have been left on the cutting room floor. Only one death scene is creative. The element of surprise is missing from this film. I'm not a hater about this film. I will buy it only to complete the series. Save your money and rent it on DVD. See a movie where special effects are cool. Before I go, I should give it some praise. I'm sorry I can't think of any. I guess all good things must come to an end. Wait! I thought of something cool about my movie experience.

Okay, some of the acting was questionable, some of the lines ultra-cheesy, but the story is wrapped up well. I liked it. A LOT! They had some of the best death scenes, matched only (in my view) by Tod's death in the first film. The worst Death to watch was the tanning beds ones. If they do make a 4th one however, what else can they add to it? The first introduced the notion of cheating death, the second shows the repercussions of cheating Death and the third shows no matter what you do, you can't cheat Death. The only possible thing New Line could do for a 4th one, in my view, is show how the Mortician knows so much about Deaths design.",Final Destination 3
471,MillenniumAbyss,Painful - not because of the deaths.,1,9 May 2012,"I love horror movies, but I also generally like them to have an interesting plot. You could summarize this movie as ""teens trying to cheat death"". However, a better summary is ""laughable teen snuff film"".There's no real reason why main character gains the power to foretell death. She just starts seeing the potential for death everywhere. Granted, I don't really need an explanation, but if I'm going to sit and watch death for a couple hours, a reason for why this movie is even occurring at all would be nice. It only gets worse from there. The death scenarios become even more ridiculous as the movie goes on. By the end I was in tears because I was laughing at the absurdity of the means of death. The fact that all the characters lacked any sort of depth of character didn't assist in my feeling remorse at their passing.The problem with this type of movie is that you can really only make one good one. After that, it surprises me that the audience would remain in their seats. If each movie follows the same formula and ends the same way, then don't you already know the final destination? Summary: This movie should be listed under comedy and not horror. The only horror to be had here is the fact you lost 2 hours of your life watching this stupid movie.",Final Destination 3

The characters were not as good, the special effects didn't come close to the effects in FD2, and it was not as gory as FD 2. Final Destination 3 starts out OK but quickly looses interest as the shortcomings of the film are shown. The characters are not as good as in Final Destination 2. The special effects, which I hoped would be as good as FD2, were very disappointing. The direction and editing of the movie leave a lot to be disired.

473,phacker332,Final Destination 3,5,21 August 2012,"Final Destination 3 takes the idea of the previous two film and does little to enhance them. Despite being incredibly predictable and the acting is as stale as two week old bread there is still fun to be had and some of the deaths are hilariously imaginative, if not sometimes a little silly. The story starts with our main character, Wendy, and her pals having fun at her Graduation party at an all American amusement park. The high school kids are about to get onto the 'High Dive' roller coaster when Wendy has, what is essential to a Final Destination film, a premonition. She witnesses the roller coaster having an accident and all her friend and herself meeting a gruesome end. After a brief panic attack, frantic screaming and a few tears she manages to convince all of her friend not to go on the ride, all apart from her boyfriend who is forced to go on it. Her friend are disgruntled that Wendy has ruined their fun however they quickly change their opinion when, as Wendy predicted, the roller coaster crashes killing everyone on it including Wendy's boyfriend. The kids cheated death but death is a sore loser and doesn't give up that easily and the rest of the film is teenage kids being picked off one by one in sometime unbelievable, sometime extravagant and always bloody, deaths.",Final Destination 3
474,semionkuksov23,Review,10,22 August 2012,"Film review (final destination 3) Final destination 3 is about teenagers trying to cheat death which is following them, because they survived at first, when they should have died. So at first the movie took place in a theme park and everything was alright, until they sat on a roller coaster which is going to come off the rails and everyone will die, however one teen girl whose name is Wendy ( Mary Elisabeth Winsted ) predicts the catastrophe and a few of her class mates got out off the cars which is cheating death, but her boyfriend went on the ride. Soon her premonition becomes true and all the time death tries to kill them in order of how they were sitting. The main characters attend McKinley high school and were celebrating their graduation. Throughout the first half of the film, Wendy wasn't trusted by her friends, because she was predicting how they will die, by looking on their photos which she made, and only Kevin (Ryan Merriman) was supporting her and he was the man who saved lots of lives with Wendy. Wendy herself was beautiful, not outgoing and a modest person, what you definitely can't say about Kevin – he was always on the move, but he wasn't careful or brave enough sometimes, for example, when Wendy suggested him to look at their photos in order to save their lives, Kevin became scared and said that he doesn't want to know how he will die, however Wendy looked at the snapshots and saved the lives of both friends. The film became even more interesting when they understood that it is possible to save people, so if death misses someone it won't come back. For me the film was credible and sometimes really, really realistic. I wouldn't call it a horror movie, because the characters showed all fear on themselves and was well matched with nice music, which makes you even more interested in the plot of the movie. Also the thing I enjoyed very much is that, they didn't try to over show emotions while people were saving each other, sometimes they had to act quickly, but still nice emotions. However, excluding good moments, each film has bad sides which I want to talk about now. Everyone understand that film cant show all moments of your live, but I didn't understand how Wendy could forget about her loss so quickly, as it showed there – she was just little bit sad for one day and then everything became fine. In addition, sometimes citizens were dying in a strange way, like Kevin in the metro ,there was accident with two trains pushing each other and Kevin was thrown to the window which was slowly cracking and instead of going away he was just lying on one place .Final Destination is thriller, horror and mystery movie, which is inappropriate for children under 15 years old, there are naked people, goriness, however I would say that it is only scary for some, because some people are really worried about characters' death which makes them fret about them a lot.Mostly my opinion about this film is positive and I would recommend you to watch it. The director of this film (James Wong) created a really believable story which made me truly worried about the actions which were happening during the most interesting sections of the film, in fact I can say that it is one of the best films I had ever seen. In spite of what I just said, there are few facts which made this film not my favourite one. I think, that there should be more time between deaths, to make the characters more interesting, for example – at the end of the film there were three deaths in three minutes. Also in the place of the director I would have made more difference between the different final destination films. So, if your parents will allow you to watch this film, then you definitely have to watch Final Destination 3!",Final Destination 3

478,michael-j-littlefield,Major Goof & Plot Holes,7,24 February 2006,"I was surprised that no one mentioned in their reviews of Final Destination 3 about a major goof that I noticed in the film. The roller-coaster car derails due to an hydraulic failure. However, the failure is caused when the first car runs over a video camera on the tracks. However, Frank, who has the video camera, is one of those who gets off. So, what becomes the spark that derails the roller coaster car?Also, when the main characters are looking over the photographs of those who got off of the coaster and they notice that they contain clues as to how they are going to die, when exactly did those clues appear? It would seem that if death was going to take them all on the coaster ride, then it would not provide clues of as to how they would die if they got off the ride. However, it would be plausible if those clues showed up only after the coaster crashed, but when they showed those pictures on that night, those clues were there.The deaths that those who survived were very complex to the point of being ludicrous and very improbable. While the deaths in the first film were not as cool as in the two sequels, at least they were more probable.The ending of the film was the best part of the movie in that it showed how death can ensure that nobody can get off, even if they have a vision of how they will die. However, I do feel that this one was better than Final Destination 2, but no where near as good as the first film. Each of the films, mostly in film one, in turn leads to a good question: Which is better: Knowing how you will die and avoiding it, only to die in a worse way? Not knowing how you will die and avoid that death only to die? Knowing how you will die and die that death? Not knowing how you will die and die that death?",Final Destination 3

The end definitely sucked cause I thought that someone would of at least lived, like in the first 2...I gotta say I still the first one was the best story line - the second one had good gore scenes and so did this one but the story line in the first one was really good. Plus in the first one 2 live and the second one we find out the guy died in a freak accident and Clear dies so yeah they were all really good - wonder if they're gonna make a fourth and what would be the premonition that someone has...they should make it a guy again though like the first one.

480,ellenvross,Huge plot hole,3,18 February 2006,"So did anyone else notice that a big reason why the roller-coaster crashed the way it did was because of that one kid's video camera. It fell on the track and when the roller-coaster drove over it it kinda started going downhill from there. So the kid who had that video camera got off the roller-coaster after that girl had her little premonition or whatever. So if the kid with the video camera that was a huge part of the accident got off the roller-coaster, wouldn't that have had a significant affect?

It is believable and well directed. When the crash happens, a lot of gory scenes happen including falling to death and being chopped in half! If you see this scene, you would probably stay away from rollercoasters for a while! Some of the deaths throughout the film are very clever and creative! They try to make you think one thing will happen but instead something else happens! Some deaths in this film are disturbing - such as being trapped in a burning tanning machine - but are worth seeing. The plot in this film is also very good. Even if you know the plot of the films, you would still love to see this film as it is slightly different than the previous ones.

And guess what, it wasn't exactly what I expected. First off, the first two had absolutely NO nudity in it. That made the first ones so much more believable. But, they just threw it in this one since it's 2006 and I guess it's supposed to be cool. But it really was a waste of a 15 minute death scene...especially when they had ""Rollercoaster of Love"" playing...how ridiculous, seeing as they should have DIED on one.Also, the acting was horrible! I have more acting ability in my pinky toes than ANY of these actors/actresses had. C'mon, none of them had any kind of delivery, passion, nothing...it was like watching a reality TV show that went wrong (a la Hogan knows Best!) I also saw that actors were cast 3-5 days before filming began. WOW!! Hire a bunch of no-name, non-acting people right before cameras roll. They should have made this a straight to video film if that was the case, rather than release it in theatres. The only reason this movie gets a five is because the gore and death scenes were great. The foreshadowing of death was limited in these movies to quick little flashes, and the initial premonition on the roller coaster was not that great because the action was going so fast. The end scene on the subway was a lot more thought out and was well-paced.See it for the gore, but that's about it. If you think anything good is going to happen forget it...!!!",Final Destination 3

The first two each only had one really good scene in it, so I figured it would be the same for this one. Plus it being another sequel, I didn't have all that high of hopes, but I ended up being really surprised. I thought they did a great job with the movie. The acting wasn't that bad and the death scenes weren't bad either. There were only a few things that were unrealistic (a digital camera making a flash sound like an old fashioned camera would have?) but those were only in the very beginning of the movie. I honestly think this was a better overall movie than one or two. It really is suspenseful from start to finish, so much so that I think I left the theater with a stomach ache I had so much anxiety over the movie, it really messes with your head.

Is this seriously how the movie ends? Overall, the movie was nice, although I felt the second had more mystery to it, while the third installment felt more like playing the game mouse trap when I was a kid.

Then its all about waiting. Waiting... Waiting... then somebody dies, Yippii! There was one thing I liked about this film. Or liked... I don't know. It pleased me in some humorous way. It was the fact that death worked like a Rube Goldenberg-device.It just made me mad to watch this film.

It was rather refreshing compared to it's competition, Scream 1-3, Urban Legends, IKWYDS 1&2, you get my drift. Then the 2nd came out a few years later. I heard it was pretty good but it did poorly at the theatre so I missed it there. I did rent it ASAP though. I fired up the old VHS and was amazed at the deaths and the originality of them. It took me completely off guard and each one was progressively better, and they were all varied. Much better than the original to me.Now we get to part 3. This is easily the worst of the lot. So many things weren't done well i'll have to limit my rants. The acting was awful even for a horror movie. The lead actress was so aggravating I almost couldn't enjoy the film at all. After that comes the death scenes, major let down here. They are nowhere near as creative or gory as they were in FD2. I noticed they really over used head injury deaths. Compound that with the length of the death scenes which is lighting fast, and you have a pretty weak movie on your hands.Lets face it we watch Final DEstinations for the death scenes not the acting but when both are as poorly executed as they are here then we have a stinker.6/10 and thats very generous...",Final Destination 3
488,amzngspdr62,I almost died of laughter,1,12 October 2008,"This movie is so terrible that it completely crosses the line of horror and leaps into hilarious. If I knew that I were going to laugh so hard, I would've wasted the 10 bucks and saw this in the theater.There's really nothing new to this film that you haven't seen in the first two. Some no name actor/actress has a premonition concerning many horrendous deaths. No one believes him/her, said deaths occur, and now they're labeled a ""freak"". Oh how original. I'm surprised this wasn't created by the geniuses that brought us such gems as Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift or Never Back Down. Message to Hollywood: Leave bad movies to Eli Roth.The only positive aspect of the movie was the comedy. These were some of the funniest death scenes I've ever seen on film; I haven't laughed this hard from a ""horror"" movie since that crappy House of Wax remake. From the ""incredible"" coaster death, to the weights crushing the jock's head, I almost died of laughter.Regardless of the comedy, skip this waste of celluloid, and get an enema.",Final Destination 3
489,etsis,Surprisingly good,3,2 February 2006,"Just got back from the world premiere of Final Destination 3 at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood and I must say that this film was surprisingly good. Definitely one of the gorier films that I have seen in quite some time, but very well put together and quite suspenseful. In fact, about half way through the film (during one particularly gory scene) about five audience members had to excuse themselves from the theatre. I have not seen either of the first two movies but was still able to enjoy this film so I'm sure I missed out on soem references that would have likely enhanced the experience. Still, I was quite pleased (especially because I expected the movie to be stupid) that Final Destination 3 was enjoyable for those who were not familiar with the original story. I also had the opportunity to speak with director James Wong to congratulate him a job well-done. He seems like a very nice guy.",Final Destination 3
490,survivor_fan_27,All Good Movie (may Contain Spoilers),10,13 February 2006,"It was a awesome movie. The begging with the roller Coaster was truly exciting. Gruesome deaths. Good Characters. In my opinion if you seen the other 2 Final Destination Films you will really enjoy this one. Final Destination 1 Final Destionation 2 then Final Destination 3. Thats the order in my opinion of greatness. Deaths are unique. Deaths in Greatness.... 1.Tanning Beds. 2.Nail Gun. 3.Sign Crushing. 4.Pole Impaled. 5.Drive thru and Weights. Overall it was a fantastic movie and I recommend watching it and buying it. Some Deaths were sad......Some were funny. This Movie contains Horror,Drama and Parts of comedy. Overall I give it a 100/100 for greatness. I Loved it and I'm sure you would too.",Final Destination 3
491,johnny_402,surprised,8,16 February 2006,"i seen it and thought it would be crap like most second sequels but it was so gory than the last two, well thought about ideas and an excellent cast except that lead bitch who like cried at everything in the film.the scene that really was most shocking was the sunbeds, GOD it was the worst. however it can get confusing with half these films,so you have to try to remember whats going on. final destination 2 was very confusing. make sure you see this film before anyone else so you can ruin it for them before they ruin it for you. anyway.i think if you liked the last two it is right up your street.",Final Destination 3
492,paulandre,Way too repetitive,6,29 October 2015,"I love the Final Destiny film series but it gets too repetitive, a girl as the main protagonist, the girl saying ""Why me?"" (Just like FD2) The girl predicting the events, a man helping the main girl, if you came here for the blood,then, enjoy the fide cause you will find a lot of it, the deaths are cool tho, the whole amusement park theme was really good, the 180 flight throwback mention was really good, but it would have been much better if one of the films complement to the last one (not just the 1st film) but anyway I can't complain that much about this film, even though i hate how repetitive these films get i still gonna watch the rest of the movies lol If you're a fan of FD you will enjoy this film as much as i did, and it's a pretty awesome film to watch with your friends",Final Destination 3
493,jeremiahdean58,Frankie getting of the Coaster...possible spoiler,6,20 February 2006,"First off Saw the movie a couple days ago and thought it was ""ok"" didn't knock my socks off...but it was interesting to see new ways that came up with for people to die. Couple questions though. Why like it FD1 does death wait 5 or 6 months to finish the job...what's special about 5 months? Last...Wasn't it Frankie's video camera that caused the roller coasters hydraulic fluid cordor whatever it isto eventually rip out? So when Frankie gets off the coasterno more camera on the coasterright? I realize the fluid was already leaking so the roller coaster might eventually have gone crazy anywaybut surely would not have broke as fast without the camera causing damage.Just curious to see what you guys think.",Final Destination 3
494,ditsyiam,The best so far!,9,25 July 2006,"I honestly think, this has to be the best one of the Final Destination series. It added something new, someone was supposed to cause someone's death, deaths are told by pictures, there are no boring parts, it keeps you guessing, and there are two premonitions. The DVD sounds great! And if they are to make a fourth one I will not watch it. It will never measure up to the first three so they shouldn't bother. We don't want to see this wonderful franchise to get dragged through the mud like Halloween, Child's Play, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's done! Everyone died. Don't add more characters, it will just get tired. NO FOURTH FINAL DESTINATION PLEASE!",Final Destination 3
495,justmaryann328,FD3 Disappointment,2,12 February 2006,"This movie was a great disappointment. This was mainly on teenagers, no mature input, didn't anyone have parents ? There was no nudity and repeated cursing in FD1 or FD2.I enjoyed the second one very much, good cast, good explanation of ""deaths design"" this one was so hokey, loud, and every character in plain English stunk ! Did we really need two naked girls in the tanning machine ? Did we need a character that used F...k in ever damn sentence ? We went to a theme park, and then thrown into a high school prom outside carnival ? The roller coaster disaster was good, but like in FD2 when Kimberly saw the horrific highway crash, and told the officer, we again saw the accident, But when this girl says, something is going to happen, we never see it , just the premonition. And come on, 3 months later, all three friends who survived death, all happen to be on the same train at the same time. Now your insulting my intelligence. Thumbs down, big time ! But then i had to be nuts to think this number 3 would be good. Save your money. Go watch FD2 again.",Final Destination 3
496,justininasia,Truly Terrible,1,20 February 2006,"Final Destination 3 is a terrible film. The plot breaks no new ground, the acting is bad, and editing is absolutely horrible. With all due respect to the editor, he/she seems to have only been provided with about 30 minutes of plot worthy material. Thats why when something important is about to happen we're forced to watch 4 or 5 cutbacks to the same event when 1 or 2 would have been plenty. Furthermore, the violence and nudity in FD3 is gratuitous. Each death is shock-and-awe disgusting. The women who get naked in the film play stereotypically shallow ""valleygirl"" roles. Its hard to shake the feeling that they were allowed to get naked because they have no other value as human beings. Its unfortunate that someone would write such misogynic female characters into a modern film. Enough said. Don't waste your money on FD3.",Final Destination 3
497,Zombieeradicator,Not as good as it could have been,5,16 August 2006,"Boy, was I disappointed with this movie. First of all, I loved the first two films, and personally own them both. I recently rented Final Destination 3, (Which I'll refer to as FD3 from here on out) being a fan. The opening scene was very good, and let people relate to a common-place fear: Roller Coasters. The 3rd part of the trilogy revolves around a cast of teenagers getting ready to graduate from High School, and they are enjoying a trip to a Carnival. After some typical teenage goofing and dialogue, the characters decide to go a massive roller coaster, the name of which escapes me as of now. Then, the trademark event of the films occurs, in the form of Wendy, having the premonition that the ride will end catastrophically. But as a reminder of the original film, Wendy creates a large disturbance among her fellow students, causing them to get off the ride following a brawl with Security. The plot goes along in the typical FD format from then on out, but after the first death the film began to lose it's magic.The film had a lower budget then the previous, so some of the things I dislike can be ignored. The movie's camera work has seemed to gain (Or lose depending on the person) a certain quality to it the first two had. It seems more dreamlike in nature, and the environment seems to be a very calm, beautiful one. This movie suffers from this, as the others had a more darker, sinister feel to them.The pacing of the film seems rushed, as well. Some parts of the movie seem to be out of place, and unneeded. At a length of 1 hour 37 minutes, it is a reasonable view. This is a normal runtime for the series, but that could have been easily extended to fit more scenes in it to slow down the action. Being a horror movie, a fast pace is usually good, but in this movie there is too much too explain in it's length.The gore scenes in the movie are very well done, excusing the film's other flaws. The scenes can become quite disturbing at gruesome at times, especially when a certain character gets decapitated by an engine fan blade.All in all, the film does not reach the standard of the other films in the series. It would have benefited greatly from a bigger budget and longer run time. But if you're in the mood for a quick horror fix, I would recommend this movie. By no means does this review condemn the movie, but merely expresses my thoughts and views on it. I leave it up to you, the reader, to determine if you like the film or not.",Final Destination 3
498,directorman101,ONE of the best,9,11 February 2006,This movie was awesome. One of the best Final Destination's ever made maybe even one of the best Horror/Thrillers ever. The deaths were the best thing about the movie of course.(Spoiler Here) 2 of my favorites was Lewis's death were his head is smashed between 2 heavy weights. Another was Ian's death with the sign on the crane falling on top of him. The only thing they could have changed was the end let someone live for goodness sakes. The reason I think its the best of the 3 is because this one is actually kinda scary. I mean the part with Franky an the car engine I mean Wow. Not only was that gross but when the blade spun one last time I jumped out of my seat.,Final Destination 3
499,TJHooker88,"The Hooker Review- ""Funfilled ride that never stops to explain anything""",10,11 February 2006,"There are going to be many posts about the movie now that its out. But heres mine. As a loyal fan and one of the few who checks here daily, here is my review.The death scenes where terrific, but however i very strongly believe there was absolutely no gore. It was not as gory as 1 and 2.Another problem with the death scenes is that everything happened so fast. In the end subway scene. you barely got to see anything cause everything was shaking and happened all to quickly. Everything leading up to the death scenes went extremely fast and left many viewers(not myself cause i knew all the deaths already) screaming out loud ""how the hell did that happen"". there was no showing the bodies after the death and in fact they had barely died before they cut to next scene. you saw a glimpse view of them and next scene.the beginning scene was a HUGE disappointment. once again it went all to fast. and there was no gore at all. almost the entire roller-coaster fell to the ground without showing any bodies hitting the ground i might add. then you see the holding on scene with lewis and when he gets hit with the debris he falls and a little bit of blood comes out. when Ian, Erin, Julie, perry all fall out. you here them hit the ground. but absolutely no visual. you do see Kevin get chopped up by the loose pipe but it goes by so fast if you had blinked you would have missed him actually dieing. no gore and it went by way to fast. basically if you put all three of the clips we have already seen together then thats the whole opening scene.the storyline.... there was none. every scene was a death scene. nothing in between and they briefly talk about flight 180. they don't even show them looking up flight 180. just talking about it. there's no story and Wong definitely turned the series into another plain old slaughter flick. the movie jumps from scene to scene so fast that is unbelievable they made the movie last for 90 min.the ending subway scene. terrible. no gore (again) and shaky camera(again) to fast to enjoy(again) the acting. good at times and definitely 10X better then a.j. cooks performance. Ian McKinley's character definitely had the best acting and ironically he has a very small Hollywood past.no story in the beginning. it opens up the night of the accident and nothing before that.the deaths rating: 1. tanning beds- very horrific and definitely made people flinch. it was well done and looked extremely real. i give it a + 2. engine blade- definitely my favorite and the crowds as well. I'm happy they cut him strait through the head instead of decapitating him. decapitation is way over used in horror movies. the best part is when the engine start back up again. the crowd was very pleased when his head is once again cut into. i give it a + 3. weights- a good one and made lots of people scream. the fact that he did a last victory push made it very interesting. and his head just exploded. they should have lasted d the scene a little longer so we could see his remains. i give it a + 4.nail gun- great but everything leading up to the death was to fast and its happened so fast that if i hadn't heard the nail gun go off i would have missed it. it was fun and exciting like all deaths but it just didn't live up to they hype. i give It - 5.flagpole- same problem. the follow up scene was to fast and very confusing if you didn't know what was going to happen already. i give it a - 6. the sign- totally fake but still entertaining. he should have purely been crushed. chopping him in half blew the death out of proportion and extremely unrealistic. the gore was great though. i give it a - so for the deaths it starts out strong but the finale deaths just quite don't cut it.the pictures in the camera. it was a great idea and made the movie a lot more fun. it allowed the audience to think along with it by saying maybe this. or maybe that.Conclusion: great addition to the franchise and certainly did its job in the death department. however the terrible storyline and lack of detail is what brought the movie down. i still love the movies and I'm counting down the days until the DVD release! wow three years of waiting for this movie and now its all over. lol i give the movie a 7/10",Final Destination 3
500,ash123uk,Good but not great!,7,10 February 2006,"the movie has, with all great horror movie franchise' .......become a comedy!!!its sad to say it, but its true. the movie theatre was in uproar with laughter.it was a great movie with a great idea but not what i was expecting...i was hoping more for the unpredictability of the 2nd, but this was ""in ya face"" what was going to happen.i will be buying this when released on DVD but only for special features and to complete the collection.i have to say...... i was disappointed with the opening roller coaster scene, i thought it was going to be great, but it is to jumpy and digital.... cant really see what is going on.i think with a movie like this.... you cant beat practical.... i know it would have been impossible for this to have been done practical, just wish it had been a bit more visible what was actually happening.All in all, the movie was good fun...

501,quiksilver_lp3,Not as good as some reviews I've read make it out to be....,4,27 February 2006,"Initially I had no intention of ever seeing another sequel in the Final Destination franchise simply because, in my opinion, the concept had run its course. After the second movie, where everybody is aware and looks for clues, I hoped there wouldn't actually be a movie that combined aspects of the first two (as FD2 referenced heavily on its predecessor). The cast overall was not terrible, and the creativity used in the death scenes was pretty nerve wracking (very intricately done, dragged on in the warehouse), but the one thing I cannot STAND about this movie is the constant warnings and pauses, background music, that make it so blatantly obvious that an important scene is coming up. This is actually my first official comment, so I figured it'd be best if I didn't include spoilers. I'm glad this movie was a freebie, because I wouldn't have paid to see it.",Final Destination 3
502,kierondyerfanclub,I have got another name for this film 'PREDICTABLE!',3,25 February 2006,"I have got another name for this film 'PREDICTABLE!'This film just left me puzzled, what was the whole thing trying to do? Entertain people? well if it does that I will just keep on being really puzzled. The roller-coaster ride part entertained me and i thought this would be as good as Final Destination 1 & 2.But after that the whole thing was talk,walk around,go to places,rain,and be sad I am just disappointed, Final Destination 3 really let me down!The whole plot was extremely predictable when they were walking up to the roller coaster ride and the girl got worried and so on.From the moment I sat down for this film I just knew what the plot would be about when I saw the trailer!There was hardly any entertaining parts in it and if there was,they were boring!!NO WAY AS GOOD AS FINAL DESTINATION 1 & 2 NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!To boring I nearly fell asleep while watching this because it is just BORING!But if you are prepared to watch a film with a while of talking in it and a film where action parts are very spaced out then give this a try if you want to try it.",Final Destination 3
503,ryandear,A Force is a Force,8,12 February 2006,"If there's one ""bad"" thing every review I've read mentions, it's the cheesy dialog and clichéd characters.Well, what do you expect, after watching the 2nd one? I liked that one a lot more than the first, mainly because it had a wicked sense of humor that was lacking in the first. That, along with nods to Hitchcock and some spectacularly gory and frightening sequences, brought the Death as Rube Goldberg concept to a whole new level.Though not quite as funny as its predecessor, number 3 delivered on my expectations of laughter while squirming in my seat. Original writer/director Wong returns with an obvious sense of envy that he didn't get to direct the second time 'round (it was *his* concept, after all), with a bigger budget, and a bigger opening thrill ride. Lack of proper lighting aside (and that isn't the fault of the movie makers, but a theater that skimps on projector wattage I suspect), the roller coaster sequence will forever change how I view amusement park rides, just as the second still makes me uneasy whenever I get behind a truck with a heavy load tied down. While the rides themselves may be as safe as possible, some of the people who ride them are surely stupid enough to ignore the signs that tell them what *not* to do (I won't spoil it--the fun thing about these movies is watching the sequences of events unfold, and still not guessing who gets it how and when).Overall, this was wickedly gory fun. It's one of those brilliant ideas that could spawn several sequels and never get tired, even though (and exactly *because*) you know for a fact that this cast won't live to see #4. If the characters are shallow, and their dialog clichéd, it only makes it all the more fun to see Death take them out in such bizarre, ghastly and gruesome ways. And since #2 at least, the films have contained hidden clues for the viewer: #2: The kid who takes the ladder in his eye bumps into his refrigerator and causes some of the scrambled magnetic letters to fall, revealing only the word ""eye."" #3: I won't spoil it completely, but there's a clue to Death's plan for the lead characters in the opening credits, as well as a line of cheesy dialog in the middle of the movie. I'll just say that Death is a force...#2 & #3: There's a nod to Hitchcock in #2, in the form of the pigeons that lead to one death. #3, no less, gives nod to #2 by way of pigeons, and yet another foreshadowing clue for those who saw the first sequel.While the characters themselves are busy trying to unravel Death's clues, I think it pretty sharp of the producers to slip in such clues for the viewer. I would guess I've missed a number of them, and will have to go back and watch this trilogy all over again just to try to find them.Word of caution if you *haven't* seen any of them yet: VERY gory. I'm *really* not into gore or the typical horror film, but the gore in these movies truly invokes as much laughter as it does uneasiness, and if you like the dark comedy, this is about as dark as it gets! Death isn't just clever, he's brutally sadistic (in fact, this film suggests, Death is none other than Lucifer himself).",Final Destination 3
504,blink182fan117,Good closing to the series,9,20 February 2006,"I have been waiting a while for this film to come out. I thought that it was very well done looking at the cinematography. The original director, James Wong, coming back was a good thing because the second was more about the gore and less about the plot and such. Wong brought back a better plot, along with some pretty creative deaths. The opening scene had my pulse running high as I felt like I was there and on the ride. I like how certain themes were continued such as the opening scene being a vision of something horrible to happen, some pattern to the dying, and trying to spot someones death and warn/save them right before it happens. To warn the viewer, there are some disturbing deaths that are worse than others -- but I found that to be true with the 1st and 2nd movies also. The problem that most people have had with the movie was that it was all about the dying scenes and nothing else. You have to be a big fan (like me) -- or just like that kind of movie to really appreciate it. If you go, go with a friend or someone, because this is one of those great films that leaves you not wanting to be alone for the night. Overall, I believe it was a great end to a series. Taken by itself, it is amazing.",Final Destination 3
505,heppcat587,i laughed my head off!!,5,13 February 2006,"I really enjoyed this movie, but not for its merit as a horror film. Of course with most movies of the ""kill abunch of teens"" ilk it had many structural problems. The movie has many plot-holes and brakes the rules that it sets up in the minds of the viewers. Any attempt that the director made at setting up a feeling of suspense was utterly demolished by all the cue's that death was coming and the elaborately filmed death sequences. The actors overall were OK except for the main character whose personality was so harsh and cold i never felt any connection to her so i really didn't care if she lived or died. Although the writers seem to claim that death is an intangible force it retains the ability to steer cars and force doors shut. Then there are the constant references to the last movies and the all important #180. The real joy i got out of this film was laughing(with the rest of the theater) at the improbable deaths. you may find this movie may makes you chuckle at the deaths of teens, and you may feel alittle nervous around sharp objects for about an hour.",Final Destination 3
506,englishlad,Great flick for violent killer freaks!,7,11 February 2006,"This movie was awfully predictable, first off we all know what happened in the prequels and if you didn't actually see them you probably had a friend that did. The death scenes were pretty gross if that is you sort of thing and not to ruin the ending for those who haven't seen it yet but it wasn't very thought through. The movie starts off dark and mysterious like the others and works it way into a chase of death for our young friends who find that they can cheat death once but death will hunt them down in the end. It is a horror/thriller/action movie guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie, I say if you want a non stop bloody thriller, then this is the one. Peace Englishlad",Final Destination 3

You'll get to see nails punched through a girl's head, it's just, um, lovely. Alongside being gory, this movie is actually quite good, but it'll completely mess up your life, and you'll never be able to go on a tram or a roller-coaster ever again. Also, there's a lot of 'blood' which is clearly fake, and the deaths are unrealistic, which totally wrecks the whole thing of the movie! Gah! Some of my friends had to leave halfway through it. It was that bad!!! And though I take gore surprisingly well...... I wish I'd left! Remember these warnings (shudder) and I suggest you avoid it, like the plague!",Final Destination 3
508,backdowntotheriver,better and more gory,10,11 February 2006,"I just saw it yesterday, and all I have to say is WOW! This was better than the first 2 which is very hard to do. The roller-coaster scene was good not great mostly because I thought it was too short and you didn't get to see everyone die, most of them you did but people like Erin and Ian you just see there bodies lying there.Now I come to the individual death scenes the tanning bed I thought it was going to be stupid cause it's been done before but it was creative and different, same as the drive thru and weight room scenes. Erin and Ian's death were brutal but in a good way, sick and gory just what i wanted. Ling's death was OK, good but not a lot of substance.The ending was great probably much better than the one they cut. It was a great finish to the best installment! 9/10",Final Destination 3

510,peckg,Typical Final Destination Movie,7,9 February 2006,"I was at a screening last night and although you know what to expect, it was still a great movie. You don't see these movies for plots or acting but for the unique ways the people die and this one was no exception and DID NOT disappoint. I thought the second one had some good and unique ways, and when the window fell on the little kid, that quickly became my favorite. However, after seeing the third one, I now have a new favorite but I wont give anything away here. I personally cant wait for it to come on DVD so I can slow motion through the death scenes. I highly recommend this movie if you seen the first 2 and were 'entertained'. You know a movie is good when everyone in the audience oos and ahs at the same time when someone dies! lol. I hope you enjoy it all as much as I did.",Final Destination 3
511,kitty-has-ears,If you liked the first two you will love this,10,23 February 2006,"I went expecting what I got, Final Destination 3. Teehee. It rocked! I loved the first two and saw them at the cinema, so naturally I had to see this one there too. Same plot, well what did you expect really this is a trilogy? OK, so you know that someone sees them die, doesn't die, people die the end. What you don't know is how people are going to die, what twists will they put in, will they then try to forever escape death or try to end it? It had the usual teen movie stereotypes; the perfect couple, the nearly perfect couple, jock, Goth's and preppy Vally girls. You know as soon as it starts the perfect couple will split, the nearly perfect couple the girl is gonna dump the apparently chauvinistic guys ass and he wants to marry her, the valley girls don't have one braincell between them and that the sister, that shouldn't be there, the sibling rivalry will be broken, bonds made then it will come back into play later, then bonds remade.They didn't skip skip skip-pity skip like the first one, they didn't learn how to stop it like the second, oh no they pretty much accepted they were gonna die and tried to skip it, thought by the last person it was done and then death seemed to just go ""oh feck it not again, ill let them off"" until 5 months later he's all a little peed at them figuring him out and death goes ""right, I'm gonna put you all in a big metal box (train) try and escape this b1tch!"" and then to the girl who had the premonition ""feck my design up will you, well you can suffer"" and her death is so strung out.OK, technical things now. No one seems to appreciate good cinematography any more. The intro was great, we know from the trailer that it takes place in a theme park, they use that to their advantage and go with all kinds of imagery from carny freak shows and also using the tarot card reader machines as a way to tell the film. The CGI of the ball in the machine dropping between fate, luck and other things before falling into death was a good touch. I loved the way they sped up and slowed down the movement of the rides in the park it just added a more sinister touch especially with the way peoples screams fade in and out, like you hear on those rides that go round and round.I loved the juxtaposition in the death of the valley girls, two sunbeds by the side of each other, two coffins by the side of each other, and the corny irony of their song ""love roller-coaster"" in fact the songs were wonderfully picked to be sarcastic ending with ""love train"" after the last three have just died on the train.Overall, if you are fan of the previous Final Destinations you will love this film, it has more suspenseful bits and build ups than usual and they are really well done. You know you are going to see a corny film about death, what should the problem be, thats what you get :)",Final Destination 3

I thought the characters would be related to the former characters in the first two ""final destinations"". It's like Wendy's been picked out of nowhere to have visions.The only thing that makes it fun is how she manages to find clues of who's next, with her camera.Overall, it was not as good as the first two ones. What happens in the end? Is there gonna be a sequel or something? It seems like there is no escape but at the same time Wendy's gonna find a way.Actually I went to see that movie because I didn't have any other choice of a movie; maybe that's why I'm disappointed.",Final Destination 3
516,jmiller06,"Entertaining movie, but contains an EXTREME plot error",7,20 February 2006,"As a whole I enjoyed this movie, and feel I got my money's worth. But, early in the movie, something happens that makes the rest of the movie broken. During the roller coaster premonition, the one dude ends up dropping his camera, which wraps around the track and starts the whole accident. BUT! He doesn't actually get onto the roller coaster, so he couldn't have dropped his camera, and the roller coaster wouldn't have crashed. Take that James Wong! Someone might argue that the hydraulics failure caused the accident, no, that would just cause the train to lose control. However, it wouldn't be able to separate the train from the tracks and what would ultimately happen is the train comes to a rest and the ride gets shut down, people removed etc. Not a tragic accident. But putting this superior blunder aside, the rest of the movie played well. The deaths were all entertaining (especially the two girls in the tanning salon. The music made it much more enjoyable to watch them burn to death) and the ending pretty much had all the resolution I needed. I haven't seen the first two movies in the series, but after watching this I might give them a view. So, if you are out with some friends on a Friday night, give this movie a shot, you probably will enjoy it.",Final Destination 3

And the pictures, with the predicting death thing, was awesome!! I think that was a good addition! And it was gory, not that the other two weren't; but this one, you could feel it! It was like you were right there watching it all happen! And just when you think you have it figured out, like with the weight bench or the horse, something happens that surprises you!

All of the deaths were so predictable, anyone who has been to see this and was ""surprised"" by any of them should shoot themselves in the head right now The reason that i did'nt give it a lower mark is for the sole reason that it's so funny the way people die. 2 hot girls get barbecued when they go to the tanning salon. WOW I SO DID'NT SEE THAT COMING!!!! The overhead view of both the beds on fire was just so funny however that I could excuse the film for being as bad as it is.If you go to see it, don't go expecting anything good, and you won't be disappointed when you leave.

In the opening scene, the roller-coaster accident in the vision was originally caused by one of the guys dropping his video camera on to the tracks. when the accident is played out for real, the guy with the camera gets off, thus no camera to cause the accident, yet the accident still happens exactly as it did in the vision?

The accident on the coaster was caused, in part, by a dropped video camera getting lodged beneath the wheels of the car, but when the girl who foresees this freaks out the kid with the video camera gets off the ride with the others. How does a camcorder that is dropped by someone who gets off the ride cause the ride to fail. The death scenes were great, descriptive and creative, but the plot falls apart once one realizes that the event that causes these kids to live and cheat death never could have occurred in the way she foresaw it...

With a great cast, the kind you would expect in a movie like this. Slutty girls, muscular black men, fit girls, fit boys and oh GOTHS! FD3 lives up to its standards and has beaten FD2 as my second favourite FD film. Although the opening Roller-coaster sequence was quite disappointing it still had my mouth open. Especially when........... The deaths were amazing and I had to look away for some of them because I just knew they were coming.

524,supra16,The movie of the year in my eyes so far,10,13 February 2006,This movie was awesome the graphics were great it was way better then the previous ones. I went to see it Saturday and it freaked me out. I definitely recommend this movie to those of you who like great quality.The actors and actresses did really well. There were some great well thought out scenes. The whole amusement park theme was so awesome. I wont ruin the surprise ending ill just say it's good. There were no boring parts throughout this movie what so ever. I must warn there is some pretty nasty visual effects so if you get sick easily I would advise not watching this. The first one was pretty bad but they really spurred my attention with the car crash theme in the second one at first I thought this movie would bomb but I was wrong. If they ever make a fourth one it will be hard to top this one.,Final Destination 3

Oh well i don't really care because it was still an amazing movie & made me jump quite a few times. Plus the way they all got killed was seriously disturbing!!!! I didn't expect the deaths to be so bad but they were, which isn't a bad thing because it made the movie even better if you ask me.

526,wolfpackfan511,Okay?,7,14 February 2006,"Okay, this movie was over all very gory. The plot is honestly the same as the first two movies. This one does have better actors and the twist they add on the plot is great. You get a clue for how the person is going to die or in others words be slaughtered to death. So you can imagine it but when you actually see it on the screen it is much worse. The producers are getting more creative every time they make this movie. The methods of death are very good but not for the weak stomached. All the deaths aren't gory but some of them just make you cringe. Also, the massive amounts of irony in the movie is amazing.Songs are played that go along with the movie and I felt like laughing but got distracted. The end is great though.

528,myemail-32,Awful,1,8 February 2006,"This movie was downright awful. The first one wasn't bad, the second one was a little worse but acceptable, this one was just bad. The first and second movies were pretty cool to see how creative the writers could get in killing off people, in this one, it just went too far. Death somehow found ways to completely defeat all laws of gravity and the universe in his unending quest to kill off the survivors of the ill-fated roller coaster disaster that started the film which surprises me since one of the characters seemed to know something about them. There was more unintentional comedy in this movie then an episode of Maury. While some people were cringing at the barely gruesome death scenes, I found myself hysterically laughing at the sheer absurdity of it all. Some of you may quip that the movie is supposed to be like that but I will be the first to say I enjoyed the first one and the whole concept isn't all that bad. Unfortunately this movie I just could not swallow. Thankfully I was able to see a free screening and will never have to spend a dime to experience this movie again. Good luck to all those brave enough to try this movie out.",Final Destination 3
529,doubled254,"Buckle up, this ride has no mercy!",10,22 February 2006,"Let me tell you, I will NEVER look at a roller-coaster the same way again. Or an exercise machine. I'll be a little wary around nail guns, too. Be extra-careful around tanning beds. Oh, and board subways at your own risk.The opening scene of this movie was fantastic. I actually got the same feeling watching them board the coaster that I get when actually climbing into them myself. My heart began to beat fast, my heart seemed to levitate into my throat, helping me realize that my throat could not have been any drier. The coaster's ascent to the top of the initial hill was extremely prolonged; not in an annoying way, but in a way that made the scene all the more effective. All it takes is a video camera's painful fall to the bottom of the coaster's loop to ensure the ending the lives of a varied group of strikingly attractive teenage roller-coaster fanatics.The most frightening part of the roller-coaster disaster was when the harnesses on the coaster first came up. I cannot imagine how terrifying that would be. The actors in this sequence did a fantastic job in portraying this horror. It did not take much longer before you see the seemingly innocent high schoolers getting hurled out of the coaster and plunging towards imminent death that Death had reserved for them. Not much longer, every single participant on the ride was dead as a doornail.Wait, it didn't happen yet! The last girl to die on the ride, Wendy Christensen, a generically likable girl with an odd haircut that progressively grew on me throughout the film saw the whole disaster in her head. A premonition, she called it. This is where the movie becomes incredibly similar to the two before it. Not neccassarily a bad thing, but I was hoping for a little twist, maybe.To make a long story short, Death was not happy with Wendy. Oh, not with Kevin Fischer, the generically likable jock that surprised you with the occasional intellectual insight, either. Wendy, being the photographer for the high school yearbook, had pictures of the would-be roller-coaster victims, each of them holding a 'clue' regarding their future, and very imminent death.Let's see... Ashley and Ashlyn were the first to bite it. Their death scene was easily the best, and most commercialized one. I mean, these girls suffered. Note to self, don't go to a tanning salon anytime soon.Frankie Cheeks was the perverted, sickening character that you could tell the whole theater was waiting for to die. Sure enough, a few sexual comments and middle fingers later, he met his match with an whirling engine blade from Kevin's car.Next, Death had the pleasure of dealing with Lewis; a dude who actually thought that Death would be afraid of him. Death retaliated by sending hundred-something pound weights down to give his head (or soon lack thereof) a little hint.The next death actually upset me a little. I didn't really want to see the appealing, brainy emo couple, Erin and Ian die. I actually kind of liked them. Unfortunately, Death didn't. Wendy and Kevin thought they saved Ian from some falling fence posts at the home improvement store, and right before they started celebrating, a poorly-placed nail gun relocated its nails in Erin's head. That scene went on far too long, and I wanted Erin to just die after one nail, but it took about 12 more nails to do it. It was painful to watch.Next, Wendy had to save her sister, Julie, almost killing Kevin, actually killing Julie's friend, Perry, who was the next to die after Erin, who was the girlfriend of Ian, who wanted to kill Wendy, who was still with Kevin and Julie, who were both just saved by Wendy. All of this confusion ends when Ian is hit by a giant billboard, crushing him just like a fly getting whacked with a flyswatter.Ahh... 5 months later. Everything must be back to normal, now... right? Don't get your hopes up. Also, don't get your hopes up about getting any decent closure to this movie. I won't ruin it for you, but you will not be disappointed. It will differ if you have an optimistic or pessimistic opinion of the characters. The ending is dependant on the condition that you have any sympathy for them, or if you have any level of admiration for Death.",Final Destination 3
530,darkfaery102,Overall Terrible,2,20 February 2006,"I thought that this movie was absolutely terrible. I thought the movie was too predictable. It was a typical premonition, girl flipping out, same old storyline. The deaths after the premonition were more amusing than the actual movie. Most of the deaths were similar, having to do with the head. Even the acting was cheesy. And the ending, was just awful. They ended it with another damn prediction! I saw this with my dad and my 11 year old brother. The three of us were laughing the entire movie. My 11 year old brother thought it was more funny than scary. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It was the worst sequel yet. I went in not expecting much, and I left even more disappointed than I expected.",Final Destination 3
531,Stingraymix,Who needs revelation when the apocalypse is already at hand?,8,11 February 2006,"For those of you reading this review due to the fact that you are on the proverbial fence about whether to go see this movie, GO SEE IT NOW, before those fence polls are driven through your skull. OK, for those of you looking for a little more of an in depth look at the movie, know this: you will be wading a while amidst shallow waters. The movies plot we grew to know and love from the past FD flicks is still in tact. There was a feeble attempt at rectifying some new perspectives involving digital camera pictures, though I must say it falls short of its predecessors in clever revelation of the characters eventual demise (ref. the word ""eye"" made via refrigerator magnets). This being stated we must all understand that this is not a movie driven by dynamic characters and a roller-coaster of emotions. Speaking of roller-coasters, the idea of a roller coaster is far to similar to a plane crash if you were to ask me, perhaps some creative brainstorming could have produced something more clever, nonetheless it does the trick. I digress, the characters are as cliché and clickish as expected, but the problem I really had with it was the fact that it was so blatantly thrown in our faces. We are told our whole lives to judge people from what's on the inside, but as I saw there was just a lot of blood inside. Therefore the movie does a wonderful job of allowing you to find your condescending inner child and stereotype each of the characters within the first 10 seconds of them entering the screen. As ""Not Another Teen Movie"" as these characters seemed, it soon became apparent that there was little time and effort put into establishing a storyline adequate producing believable characters. This is of course due to the high fatality rate within the FD series, though the connection with the previous two movies felt oddly absent. The first two seemed to be a closely knit brother and sister combo whereas the third was the ugly half sister. I refer to the brother and sister analogy following the suite of the main characters, see I can be overly obvious too! Yes, I did give this movie an 8 out of 10, and I will soon address that, but I really need to stress one huge point of the movie. That point is that this is not a movie that has the time or momentum to put forth substantial characters, compliant plot, theme driven transitions, let alone transitions at all (sans the funeral after those girls like' totally got fried), continuity, structure, or any of the key elements that usually make a movie a movie. What this movie does have though is precedence. The first two movies having made such an impact as they did, act as a fail safe for this film to throw logical storytelling to the wayside and focus on what people are there to see, the gruesome murders of everyone they knew in high school. Having seen and been a fan of the previous two films in the series I had the foresight to turn my brain off prior to entering the theatre and just truly get in touch with that inner child i previously spoke of. The bottom line here is that if you are looking for a film that leaves you full, satisfied, and wanting a smoke afterwards go rent Citizen Kane for the fifteenth time. If you can toss away all your adult friendly convictions on politics and religion that you keep cocked and loaded, finger trembling on the trigger, ready to fire at any opposition for a mere 90 minutes, you will walk away smiling and refreshed. Refreshed in the fact that you went to see a a gory strung together mess of blood and boobs, that was in fact exactly what you got for your 10 dollars, because boys and girls if the previews I saw (""Stay Alive"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"") were any indication of what is to come in the genre of horror flicks we are going to have another inevitable dry spell, that is until April with the release of ""Silent Hill"", until then... -Justin",Final Destination 3
532,wneal-2,"If you liked the first 2, you'll love this one!",8,16 February 2006,"I got to see a sneak preview of this movie with a lively crowd, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Quite a few movies in the horror genre depend on special effects which take place in the dark, so you can't make out what is happening. The Final Destination movies, however, do not fall into that category (with emphasis on the ""gory""). Final Destination 3 is probably the goriest of the 3 movies in this series, and that is a good thing. They don't wuss out on the special effects of the death scenes, so when death catches up to the survivors of the initial roller coaster disaster, it catches them with a vengeance (and you get to see every grizzly bit of it)! The audience gets lulled into a false sense of relief several times in the movie, before the nasty deaths occur, and each time they did a collective jump. It wasn't unusual to hear an audible sigh of relief followed by a sudden ""ouch"" as the characters meet their deaths. All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed this movie and its gory comedic deaths.

It is the same poorly written predicable script as the first two, except this time rather than just being a bad idea for a movie it also happens to be an over-milked bad idea for a movie. This movie however was somewhat entertaining, the poor rating is a reflection of how well the desired reaction was achieved. Instead of watchcing in suspense you just watch the too obvious clues and wait for the inevitable to happen. Terror, there was none.

I was glad to see that the third installment of this creative series follows more along the lines of the first one and not the second one (which I feel the second one sucked). It wasn't to comical and not to gory that it was beyond belief (like FD2). The acting was good, and if you add that to a great story and great directing, you've got a great movie. It was a very creative movie with the death scenes, if you thought someone was gonna die one way BAM! All of the sudden they die another way. I wish that they had skipped making the second one and just had this be number 2. This movie also has a great ending that surprises and makes you think. I hope that James Wong make number 4 where he left off on 3. I do believe that James Wong is What made 1 and 3 so great (Wong did not direct FD2). So in closing if you are a fan of the series, see this movie now! If you have not seen one and two see them first so you have a good idea as to whats going on (even though FD2 sucked).

The movie starts at an amusement park when the main character, has a premonition of a roller coaster crashing with her and her friends on it. She stops the ride and seven people get off with her. The roller coaster crashes (of course) and the people who got of start dying in the order that they would have. Overall I thought this was a really good movie, but the director didn't think about enough. The roller coaster crashes because two girls (who ended up getting off) knocked a camera out of another guy's hand (who also got off). That means the roller coaster would never have crashed!! That is the reason this movie got a seven out of ten.",Final Destination 3
539,lycanthropicsquirrel,A rather great improvement.,10,11 February 2006,"Where to begin, well naturally I had to see this movie the second it came out in theaters. So, I'm a fan. If you're not particularly interested in it then I'm afraid, you'll leave the theaters angry and nauseated (well maybe not).When I first saw the poster for this I couldn't help but feel this would be a stupid sequel. I mean you gotta admit, death from a roller coaster seems far less extreme than a plane explosion or a pile-up. And I noticed how pictures would be a part in this plot, and I thought the odds of this movie being any good compared to the other 2 would be about 1/10 (which are fairly good odds compared to how other people may perceive sequels).Despite my thoughts, I found the accident scene to be much more exciting than earlier expectation. Eventually the plot really hooked me in. The deaths are very gruesome. I nearly cried when I saw the first death. But This movie was quite an experience. The only issue with the trilogy (or w/e this may end up being) is the different patterns in death's design. The 2nd threw me so off. The acting in this was fairly good. I mean you rarely express much emotion more than fear in horror movies anyway. I felt it needed a little something more...not sure what. But I feel the ending needed something. All in all a decent improvement in the story. I think this movie may be the best out of all 3.",Final Destination 3
540,fernau7,Movie Preview,2,11 February 2006,I enjoyed the first 2 Final Destination movies. I did not like this movie at all and felt it was a waste of my money. It had nothing to do with the first 2 movies. It would have been nice to have some of the characters that survived in the second movie to be incorporated in this movie. The first two movies mixed together more and this was one was like it was from left field. The storyline was terrible and you can tell it was not written by the same person that wrote the first 2 movies. We bought the first 2 movies on DVD however I will not be purchasing this one when it comes out. Needless to say I was very disappointed in the movie and will not be recommending it to anyone to go see. Again to me it was just a waste of my money.,Final Destination 3
541,dannycheng,minted to the max...... going to watch it again soon,10,11 February 2006,"probably the first one to notice a big..... big..... big mistake....In the ""premonition"" the cause of the crash was the camcorder wrapped round the rail. However, the owner of the camcorder (and the camcorder) is taken off the roller-coaster in their real life. Therefore how can it break if the cause of the break isn't there? anyone else realise????A little bit predictable if you see FD1 and FD2 before it though.High Dive = High Di e... (die)...... similar to Evan Lewis (Lottery winner on FD2) when the plastic H off the fridge (that spelt HEYE) left EYE - this is where he was killed.The only problem is the predictiveness of it, but it still is better than FD1 and FD2......",Final Destination 3
542,msells,Great,10,11 February 2006,"First of all this was a great movie. I would suggest it to anyone that loves blood and guts and gore. And if you enjoyed the first two Final Destination movies you will love this one. I know i did. This movie was a brilliant, imaginative, and very realistic done by the writer. I would have to say i give him 2 thumbs up, and Vote 10 for being a excellent movie. It starts off very suspenseful, and ends with a cliché sort of. All i can say is its all DAJA VU all over again. Wow. The only complaint i had was that it was only 90 minutes long. Anyone that is even considering seeing this go see it as soon as you can. You will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this movie if you want to spend a quite scary and frightening moment watching this thriller. But be prepared to be scared. Death is unfindable!!!!!!",Final Destination 3
543,rob-1404,A hell of a ride!,7,12 February 2006,"The third instalment of Final Destination was right up there with the first one! Having been let down slightly with Final Destnation 2, this film was not just enjoyable, was fast and got straight to the deaths, without all the silly aftermath of the roller-coaster crash, and the deaths themselves were fantastic and made you jump out of your seat, along with the rest of the cinema. I was made to think about the meaning of the film before I even got to see it. As I arrived at my cinema I saw that it was sold out. My friend Ian and I were both annoyed, so I tried to pre-book tickets for the following night. However, someone had moments ago returned two tickets they didn't want, and the lady said we could take them. I was delighted, until Ian turned to me and said ""It must be fate that we are meant to get in there tonight! Maybe something is gonna happen!"" Not what I wanted to hear! Thankfully the only thing that happened is that we saw a great film, and both got to sit next to two stunning girls. Anyway on to the film!The beginning of the film, leading up to the premonition and the crash, was very tense. Wendy, is on a senior trip at an Amusement Park with her boyfriend and friends. Right from the start of the film, she is very nervous and a little spooked by things around her, and when she sees the roller-coaster she is straight away put off by it's speed, size, and the big deep voiced devil with glowing red eyes warning them that this will be their last ride. To be honest, that would have put me off the ride by itself! She boards the coaster anyway, and has a premonition of it crashing. She tries to warn people and manages to get some people off the ride, however her boyfriend is not one of them, and the ride sets off. She chases after him, but it's to late, and as she is escorted outside, you hear screams, Wendy looks up, and sure enough, the coaster has come on the tracks and is flying through the air!Having escaped death, the people who got off the ride are now on ""the list"", as we've heard many times. Some of the deaths are very graphic, and I warn people about seeing this film, if you don't have strong stomachs, or people who like sun-beds, as two people, who happened to so annoying, you were glad to be rid of them in a way, are trapped in sun-beds, with the temperature rising, and they burn to death. All the other deaths are so much better and graphic than Final Destination 2, and to a level, Final Destination 1, that this is my favourite of the 3. The suspense at the beginning set the tone for the film, and it carried on from there, finishing off with by far the best ending! If Mr Wong decides to do Final Destination 4, he will have great difficulty beating this one, so I would advise Mr Wong to quit while he's ahead. We've had all the best accidents possible. Planes, Cars, Roller-Coasters, and at the end of 3rd one, trains.Overall this was my favourite of the 3 by far, and I strongly urge people reading this review to go see it. I cannot wait for the DVD to come out. It was quite simply, a hell of a ride!",Final Destination 3
544,CougirlLP1,Great Deaths...but should it have happened?,7,12 February 2006,"I was expecting this movie to be really bad. It surprised me! It was a decent movie.The beginning seemed to be a little overdone, but it got better throughout the movie. They could have done without the nudity. Why must every film have either nudity or a love story?? The deaths were great!! Especially the nail gun one! The thing that I noticed, which wasn't until the next morning that I realized it, but did anyone else realize that the whole roller coaster thing shouldn't have happened when some of the riders got off? Think about it..the reason that the roller coaster goes out of control is because that annoying guy drops his video camera. BUT HE GOT OFF THE RIDE!!!! If he got off the ride, there was no video camera to mess up the coaster!! That's what made it a seven for me! It just ruined the whole movie for me.Ironic: I wore a shirt of mine to the movie that has ""Control Freak"" on it! Haha.",Final Destination 3
545,brianbearwv,"Not a bad movie, special effects were good",6,13 February 2006,"Seen this movie on opening day (2/10/06) I have to say I was impressed with the special effects, although some of the ""death"" scenes happened so quickly you could not really see what happened to the character. It made me want to NEVER get into a tanning bed. EVER! Thumbs up most definitely on this movie.. but def not for viewers with a weak stomach. The movie was well written and the characters in the movie were totally awesome as well. The ending scene with the subway seemed most realizing, if not very scary. All in all, I would probably go see it again, but would definitely make sure I didn't eat first. The director of this movie did a great job as well.",Final Destination 3
546,patrickfraser332,Final Destination 3,9,26 February 2006,"This Movis was one of the greatest! nothing like when a stranger calls, this actually has a great beginning, and the action carries you through the movie.when Wendy has a deadly premonition of her class mates, she wakes up and realizes it is coming true, she starts to scream wildly, and they get her, and 6 other people off the ride, only to watch the ride fall off the track. then the people who supposedly cheated death, start dying in unimaginable ways. Wendy and Kevin have to find a way to defeat death before it gets them and her little sister Julie. the ending with the train was awesome! but it doesn't signal a next final destination in the trilogy.this was an awesome movie, go and see it!",Final Destination 3
547,mbrook_england,Very very impressed yet again!,9,13 February 2006,"I am yet very impressed with another sequel to Final Destination. Final Destination is one of the few films out there where the sequels just get better and better. I always get a little worried when a sequel comes out to a good film because they can sometimes spoil the original but this hasn't at all.All though it was all predicable what was going to happen it was fantastic. It still keeps you on your edge of seat and the deaths in it were really graphic and gory. There are some fantastic special effects and camera work!Well I am definitely going to be purchasing it on DVD when it comes out to go with my other two. I highly recommend you see this if you have seen the previous two.If you haven't then see those first, and then go watch this! I give this 9 out of 10 for me.",Final Destination 3
548,okey12,Great film,9,14 February 2006,"Before I start, I'm not a fanatic of this film, and I haven't seen the first or second one, so I'm writing from the point of view of someone who just went to the cinema with some mates, and decided to watch ""the film about the roller-coaster"".The film is very good, with plenty of gore if you're into that, and some topless girls on sunbeds. But the film is so much more than the boring old 'monsters come, monsters kill, brave teenagers kill monsters' - cos in this film, there are no monsters - no killers. The killer is death, that is, fate. The film makes you think, i gotta admit. It's not as straight forward as most horror films. There is much to be worked out before it happens. But if you're not the brightest spark, there's always the topless nudity and gore! Great film, i won't spoil it for ya, go see it!",Final Destination 3
549,fettethp,Even better than Final Destination 1 and 2,10,14 February 2006,"If you liked the first two Final Destination movies, you will undoubtedly love this action movie. Movies that are the 3rd in a series never seem to be entertaining, but Final Destination 3 breaks the trend. It is similar in style, (slightly more gruesome), and filled with action. If you did not like the first two, then this movie is obviously not for you. People that give this movie a bad review obviously did not enjoy the first two, and therefore should not have bothered seeing it. The movie is nonstop action and will be appreciated by the audience the previous two movies have already established. Best action movie of 2006 thus far in my opinion.",Final Destination 3
550,toxiclovur123,Best Movie Ever!,10,15 February 2006,"This movie was the most awesome movie Ever!!! It puts the first two movies to shame! All the actors were great, and Ryan Merriman is the hottest thing ever!The beginning starts off great with the usual person seeing the horrible thing happen, and in this case the scenario was a roller-coaster. They avoid the death, after this they then try to cheat death but do they? You will have to go see this great movie and find out yourself! All the actors do a great job of portraying these distinct characters, and the movie deserves to win a couple Oscars and academy awards.The hottest thing in the movie is Ryan Merriman who shows off his awesome looks and acting abilities! Go see it now! you wont be sorry!",Final Destination 3
551,jjump06,Disappointed,5,17 February 2006,I was disappointed with this movie. The first 2 were great and this one just didn't hold up to what I expected. The actors were bad and it seemed more like a low budget movie. The plot was not that good either. I mean at least the second tied into the first a little this had nothing to do with the others. All in all when I left the movie theater I wished I had spent my money on something that was better. I would not recommend this movie to anyone you would be better off waiting until it goes to DVD. I thought final destination 2 was the last but I was wrong. This is definitely to drug out and I just hope that they don't waste the money on a fourth.,Final Destination 3
552,theresaheard,Better than the 2nd!,8,17 February 2006,"The first one is still the best but Final Destination 3 is by far better than the sequel. The cast is pretty much a bunch of unknowns but they are believable. The diversity among the teens is better this time with the rich, snobby girls to the goth couple that already look as though death has became them. There is more gore this time and some unnecessary topless teens doomed for their deadly turn but this one keeps you guessing who will be next and how death will come to them! Final Destination 3 will make you think twice about ever getting on a roller-coaster again! I only wish I had more popcorn to last longer on this one. Grab someone to hold onto and go see this one!",Final Destination 3
553,srwoo_dm,Decent Entertainment - Not An Oscar,7,18 February 2006,"I gave this film a 7/10 because it does what it is advertised to do - entertain. This movie is entertainment for the masses there is no other way to look at it and I can't give a lower rating because I don't feel in touch with the characters or the scripting wasn't intelligent because I went to this movie to be thrilled by an almost roller-coaster ride of cleverly executed deaths and the constant fight the protagonists face against an invisible force.This is a teenage movie and that's what you will see. Mel Gibson or Bruce Willis aren't going to grace the screen with their acting caliber. Instead you will be greeted by the stereotypical ""invincible"" teenager that needs the rude awakening that in fact he/she can die.The movie also does a good job at not frustrating the audience with bonehead decisions made by the escaping victims, death is pretty much everywhere what can they do but wait and try to avoid it when it comes? The characters which irritate you off the most tend to die the quickest too, not forcing you to watch the whole movie with their ignorant butts being alive while poor sap gets their neck caught in the elevator (as in FD2).The deaths are all ridiculously gory and ridiculously implausible - probably done to make the deaths more enjoyable and less frightening, yet they are still not for the faint of heart. I for one wasn't bothered but some of the deaths are very disturbing for those that aren't into these types of movies and therefore those individuals may want to avoid this one.I'd like to end with my overall feeling in that I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had seeing this movie - it was exhilarating 'til the end and I recommend it to anyone. Especially if you have low expectations for the film - you might just come out having enjoyed it.",Final Destination 3
554,conic,Entertaining and a visual treat. Critics will hate it but FinalD fans will LOVE it!,10,19 February 2006,"The movie is what it is. If you are entertained by attractive actors being bumped off in very clever and visually spectacular chain of events...there is no better movie (hence the 10 rating). If you are worried about what other people think, and are constantly looking for the next Oscar winning movie, then stay away. I'll admit, there are a couple of moments that seem a little slow and areas that could have been improved. For example, I would have like to have seen more of a tie in with the last movie. Part two built such a solid bridge to part one, part three felt more like a stand alone movie.This movie is a must see for the BIG screen, you will not be disappointed! The eye candy and special effects more than make up for any flaws that you find or hear about. Do not wait for the DVD on this one, save that for the stuffy, Oscar nominated, critic approved movies.",Final Destination 3
555,love_moon589,out of the 3 movies this was the best,7,19 February 2006,"This one had more blood and guts in it. I think that if you really like bloody movies this is one you have to see! So people that I had talked to about this movie said that it was boarding and that you shouldn't go see. Then someone even said that the wished they had taken their I pod that is so not true! Then some people said that they was tried of the sequels that was just alike that is so not true either this one is nothing like the first 2. After reading some of the comments that some of you left I just had to go to the movies and see it and like I said early it was great. Better then the other 2 and more action, blood, and guts. It was great!!! I only reason that I gave it a 7 was because of the end. See it for your self and vote.",Final Destination 3
556,ricthornton,Without a doubt... go see this movie in the theater!,10,20 February 2006,"When I saw the trailer for this movie.... all I could think of was... the first two had rather cool death scenes, so I'm sure its going to take a genius to come up with seven more death scenes worthy of the big screen. I paid my 8.00 to get into the Regal Stadium 16 movie theater in Salisbury, MD (by the way a great movie theater with huge screens and DTS!), sat down with my brother in law and prepared to at least be amused with the ideas... I however was not prepared for the onslaught of madness that this movie contained. From the opening to the end, I was on the edge of my seat, and found myself in awe of this great film. I actually found myself talking to the people in the movie (which I NEVER do and am usually annoyed by) along with EVERYONE else in the theater. Just when you thought you had figured it out... you were wrong.This movie is a must see, and I am even considering going to see it again! Great movie... and I hope the genius minds that are coming up with these scenes can create more!RATING: 10 excellent movie!",Final Destination 3
557,DramaDude926,Final Destination 3 Review,10,20 February 2006,"I Just saw Final Destination 3 Today and I can't get it out of my mind. I love the different deaths and sudden disasters. I feel that this movie is a lot better than the first two because of the new properties. The Pictures that tell Wendy how the people die. I also liked the second premonition of the train crash at the end. Personally, My favorite death was the one in the weight room. I mean you thought that the swords were going to cut the guys head off. Didn't you! I know you did. Any way, It was sudden for him to lift the weights and then they fall sideways and crush his head. I really didn't expect that!!!I also thought that the Roller Coaster crash Was really cool.Usually when there is a sequel to a movie it isn't as good as the first but that isn't true for this sequel. It is ten times the excitement,Gore,and thrill as the first two. I myself am right now Writing Final Destination 5 Because I hear that the fourth one is about a casino accident. If Any of you readers have any Ideas for deaths please e-mail me at DramaDude926@aol.com and Title it Final Destination 5. Thanks for reading. -DramaDude926",Final Destination 3
558,stuart_croft666,"Really Good, but a tad gruesome!!",8,21 February 2006,"Well, where do i start, having just got back from seeing Final Destination 3 at the cinema. Having seen the first two films in the 'trilogy', i was looking forward to seeing the third instalment. It was literally a non-stop roller coaster ride from start to finish!! And i never expected the deaths of the survivors to be that bad! (in blood and gore terms). I mean, whereas in the first two, you don't really see much of the deaths actually happening, just the ""end result"". In FD3, you see everything as the character sees it! Now I'm not one for being squeamish, and turn away on things like this, but at times it was just a bit too disgusting if you get what i mean!! But still, another good film in the Final Destination films! Well worth seeing!",Final Destination 3
559,dictator_ship_degree,A short review of Final Destinaiton 3!,10,21 February 2006,"This movie is mainly about a senior named Wendy, which is played by Mary Winstead, who so happens to have a premonition that dealt with death while on the roller coaster. Through her premonition she managed to get some of the people off the roller coaster ride, but not her close friend and boyfriend. Kevin, played by the versatile actor Ryan Merriman, also a senior got off the roller coaster with Wendy and evaded their death. And so, death is such a cry baby and went off to get the people that were suppose to die in the order they sat on the roller coaster. Wendy and Kevin then set off to help and intervene with the lives of their fellow classmates and such so to prevent death from happening. Out of all the people that went off the roller coaster only three of them survived Wendy, Kevin, and Julie. Five months later they all met on a train ride and unfortunately, Wendy had another vision or premonition that they were going to well....you have just got to watch Final Destination 3 instead.<3______;)",Final Destination 3
560,hward-3,confused about the beginning!!!,6,22 February 2006,"i just don't get it...... When Wendy has the vision about how the roller-coaster crashes, her vision shows Frankie dropping the video camera on the track which causes it, but when she tells them all to get off, Frankie is one of the seven who get off, so how did the roller-coaster crash? so has anyone else noticed this? Because i noticed it straight away but no one else mentioned it to me? i don't know if i was meant to notice it or not but i thought it was pretty obvious? But overall i thought the movie was very good, quite disturbing and has put me off many things now. but everything that happens is not expected. i thought the story line from how it carried on wasn't all that good but i would still give it a 6/10!!!! please reply if anyone else saw the glitch thank you",Final Destination 3
561,xxmillixx,Final Destination 3 =BRILL!,10,22 February 2006,"I went to see this film with my friend expecting the same thing as FD1 and FD2 but, it's nothing like it I jumped out of my skin plenty of time! And when they are in the DIY store make sure you look for how the girl dies! It's an excellent and on the way back me and my friend were so scared we had to drive home at like 10mph we were so paranoid! It does effect your life and its amazingly scary! When the roller-coaster is crashing it makes you think how on earth did someone make something like that up and how did they know it would kill them all. The idea of cheating death is very scary as I myself have had some near death experiences however i am still here! After watching the film I went round to my friends house and she cooked us some pizza, however if her daughter hadn't gone to check we would of all died. It really does make you think! 10/10!",Final Destination 3
562,ekimsitruc,Scary? Doubtful,1,23 February 2006,Having seen the first Final Destination I knew what to expect. Unfortunately this did not disappoint as yet again all the characters supposedly die although like the first one we never really see their deaths at the end. I went into this movie thinking that it would be frightening instead found it extremely boring and too predictable. Moreover the gore in this movie was just a little too extreme and almost completely impossible. One person's head is completely smashed by a weight set (you have to be in an odd position with the weights completely loaded down for that to even be possible) If you want to see Final Destination 3 I recommend saving some money and finding the first or second one on television.,Final Destination 3
563,jaclyn3693,about the movie and what i think,10,24 February 2006,Oh my god i think that Final Destination 3 was the best movie i ever saw it was better then the other 2 final destinations...i think that everyone should see this movie when it comes out on DVD i am going to buy it cause i love that movie so much and Alexz Johnson that is in it is one of my friends so i love it even more ......=)i can watch that movie over and over again it is the best movie in the whole world my friends when we went were really scared at some points and i don't even get scared so that was really funny also. .........=)...... ................ ............=). ............. .........=)... ............... ......=)....... ........=)......... ........... .............=)....... ....... .......... ...=)........ .........=)......... ......... .....,Final Destination 3
564,duckijunior88,Wasn't Very Logical,4,24 February 2006,"Overall I liked the movie, but I have a few complaints. Why did no one find it a little odd Wendy knew what was going to happen. I mean how many kids' deaths did it take for people to believe her? I liked Final Destination 2. The first one was very slow and dragged out. If they make another one, I don't think it will be very good unless they really spice it up.The whole story line is getting old, I feel as though the movie is a poorly put together plot to display impossible freak accidents.A good sequel would explain why those certain characters are chosen to have the premonitions. Why is it always girls too?",Final Destination 3
565,superman_robe,Doesn't make sense.,5,24 February 2006,"I rated the movie a 5 out of 10 because i felt that the movie was good, but i think there may have been a flaw. When the main character (i don't remember names) has a vision of the roller-coaster crashing, it's clear that the reason for the crash/derail from the tracks was due to the guy with the video camera dropping his camera which wrapping itself around the track. But when she pops out of her vision the guy with the video camera gets off as well. So if the guy with the video camera, who causes the rollercoasters derail, gets off then the roller-coaster would of never derailed. Now i understand that there was a hydrolic leak but the leak would not send a roller-coaster off the tracks. So what i am very curious to know is how does the coaster derailed? Secondly, what caused the roller-coaster to derail? And lastly, why doesn't it show in the reason for the crash in the movie?",Final Destination 3
566,joanne1811,should have gone straight to DVD,1,26 February 2006,"I have to agree with Luke Edwards comments with regards to the big stinking pile of manure that is fd3. I am not quite sure what everyone else watched, but this seems to me as if this film was thrown together in the same length of time that it takes to watch it (90 mins)!! The plot is full of holes, you don't feel any sympathy for the victims and whereas before you were treated to a well thought out opening, this one took too long to start and then showed you nothing in regards to how they died. You only see people flying off the roller-coaster at speed. Even the premonition bit was wrong, she saw what happened in the 3 seconds it takes for the guy to tell the operator to start the ride. This is hopefully the end of the final destination franchise as it seems to be going down the same route as Friday the 13th and end up going to straight to DVD.",Final Destination 3
567,lilfearboy89,Gets You Jumping Out Of Your Seats and Screaming,8,26 February 2006,"Definitely the best finial destination of the 3. Although this movie is not exactly linear to those of 1 and 2 because in Final Destination 1 and 2, those who cheated death died in the order of how they would of died in the dream, In Final Destination 3 they died according to the pictures that was taken by the protagonist, Wendy. Other then this mistake, it is by far the best of the 3. It really takes you on a roller coaster ride, you are shown clues along the way and you yourself can figure out how a person would die along with Wendy. It's great how you can also predict the death of a character and surprisingly you can see for yourself if you're right or wrong. It lets you play the role of Wendy.",Final Destination 3
568,arf132004,Wow!!,9,26 February 2006,"I thought it was good. I had to see it after I've seen the first two, which were very good also. And they won't be able to stop death in this movie, because the main character had a vision at the end of the movie, and it showed that everyone will die. After her ""vision"" she was like, ""We're all going to die!!"" Then after that she pulled the emergency brake, and it didn't work. But then yes I do think that they will stop death(someway), and I also think their will be a 4th Final Destination movie. If they do come out with a 4th, I think that it will be where they go to see some fireworks, and somewhere around there is a bomb, and the main character will panic and be like their is bomb that is going to explode. Then the people that believe he/she will run home, then death will pick them off from the order from the order of the shock wave. Well that is my idea of the series. And from what I've seen that really didn't happen in the 2nd one is that where they let the 1st death go.Ohh and this movie really shouldn't of happened. The dude with the nude girl necklace dropped his camcorder and it got stuck on the track in the girl's vision. The reason why I say that is because, he got off because he trusted her. So in my opinion the 3rd on shouldn't of been about a roller coaster called ""Devil's Flight"". Still, they have found away that the roller coaster would still fall off the tracks, which is totally wicked. And yes I have to admit that after seeing Final Destination, I started to get those premonitions too, and what about I'd say everything. What stupid people do on the road and how people walk without paying attn. to the traffic, other stuff like that. And if any of you commenter's on this site relate to what I just said, don't get mad at me if any of this is you.",Final Destination 3
569,nick_19,very weak movie compared to previous ones,1,26 February 2006,"first and second parts were great. this one was very very unoriginal, it plain sucked compared to the other two. all scenes were hastily done, as if everything was in a hurry to kill them all so that movie could finish.. if you still want to enjoy the movie, probably should watch them in this order: 1, 3, 2final destination 2 is the best one. when watching it, you'd never know what would happen next, which is not the case with this movie.. everything was way too obvious.get some real actors.. who were those jokers there",Final Destination 3
570,daisy_stardust,Well i liked it anyways...,8,27 February 2006,"Some people have registered their disappointment with the latest installment of the Final Destination Trilogy, but, as a die hard gore fan, i thought it had everything you need! An all you can eat buffet of succulent young guys and girls, meeting their maker in various imaginative and colourful splatterings. Hell yeah, there was nudity, in the form of two 'sexy laydees' which(although I'm no prude), i thought was uncalled for, but they met a pretty gruesome end, much to my obvious delight, (i couldn't hide my ghoulish grin even in the darkened cinema!) but it was also full of suspense, grit and emotion, that had me on the edge of my seat throughout! big thumbs up! so there.",Final Destination 3

No more, no less! You can't expect an Oscar Winner, but you are going to be 90 minutes without a break! :0) (Could you say that with ""Lost in Translation""?) Like a roller coaster enthusiastic, I never think about a crash like that, it is a frightening sequence. If you have ridden ""Viper"" in Magic Mountain, LA. You'll know this is a similar roller coaster in height (almost 200 feet) and it has a lot of loops. One of my favorites coasters. :0( Hey guys, please, follow the rules, no cameras, bags, into the ride. (I know the mistake with the famous camera , in the film, I guess other guy had a camera too) There is difficult to find a good horror movie these days, but, this movie deserve that you pay, so, take the ride!

Nice job of this movie to push those right on the edge of kidnapping, raping and killing a young girl because of this and other examples of teenage girls (uh...UNDERAGE? Under 18? Hello? Not adults, not grown women?) are SATURATING movies as objects of lust. God help us when irresponsible individuals make movies like this and then we as a collective are SHOCKED and outraged when not only the teenage victims but the Poly Klaas's of the world get sexually attacked and killed.OK. So, does it REALLY matter and make it OK that the actresses in the movie are actually not under-aged but in their 20's? Umm. YES, because we're not watching the actresses' life stories, we are watching and immersed in the lives of high school kids! HIGHSCHOOL KIDS. The pedophile who will soon find a REAL 17 year old to sexually abuse and kill sees only the high school girl, not the 20-something year old actress playing her.So if you're a pedophile who spend a LOT of time in your room alone, this movie is for you! BURSTING at the seams with testosterone and disturbing sequences involving not only underage naked kids but animals.Bottom line: The first movie was great, but this horse is dead, put away the stick. Definitely not a date movie (unless you want your boyfriends and husbands to be spoon-fed that teenage girls are meant to be lusted after). Please, no more cheesy, pathetic attempts at being gory and clever. No more recycled plots, please! And for God's sake, be responsible and at least make the girls COLLEGE-AGED where they are actually legal. We paid good money for tickets to see child pornography (that's right, once again, under 18).",Final Destination 3
573,aford1,amazing!!!! scary!!!!! revolutionary!!!!!,9,1 May 2006,"This movie has it all. Blood, guts, and no characterization whatsoever!!!!! Yes! Finally! I was a fan of the first two, but I hated the way that the filmmakers tried to make it scary. I mean, come on! What's so scary about death? I just want to see some cool f**kin' deaths and cool f**kin deaths was just what I got, TENFOLD!!! The movie, as I'm sure you all know, follows a young woman (who cares what her name is? I didn't) who has a horrifyingly horrifying vision of she and her friends dying on a roller-coaster thanks to a camera lying on the tracks. Needless to say, she flips her motherf**king s**t and gets off of the roller-coaster, along with a few others and--surprise, surprise--the roller-coaster does, indeed, malfunction and kills everybody onboard. But, as we all know, Death doesn't like it when motherf**kers f**k with him, so he goes after the survivors with a meaner streak and an even more cruel sense of humor. Blood and guts hit the fan. Color me happy! I love dead people!I love that the filmmakers decided against doing anything new involving the story, with the exception of introducing photographs that give clues to who will be the next to be squashed, crushed, impaled, or have their heads severely damaged. At least that is what I think that was about. I don't know. I was too busy being bored and waiting for the next gore-ific scene to take place. Anyway, I dug all of the characters and was disappointed to see their heads get smashed in, impaled, or nail-gunned. I especially loved Lewis, because he will definitely inspire young black males to work out and just win, baby, just win. I loved him. What an inspirational character!!I hated the goths and was glad that the girl got her head riddled with nails.And the song that plays over the end titles (a ""Love Train"" cover sung by tommy lee. It gets the toes tappin and the gore was pretty groovy. A perfect movie. I love it like a fat kid loves an all-the-greasy-food-you-can-eat-for- free restaurant!",Final Destination 3
574,jstone3503,Excellent Movie and very gruesome.,9,5 March 2006,"This is by far one of the best movies I've seen in a while. It is however, probably the one with the most gore. I honestly just wanted to watch it at first because I have met one of the actors in it and have always been a fan of all his movies. But that's another story.Anyway, here's a little spoiler.Movie starts out at an amusement park. The main character, Wendy has a vision of the roller coaster crashing and everyone dying. Well, right before it takes off, she freaks out and her and another character, Kevin get off the ride. A fight ensues just off the tracks and Kevin and some other people are escorted out while Wendy's boyfriend tries to get off to see if she is OK, but security prohibits him from doing so. Moments later, the ride crashes and Wendy's boyfriend, Jason and Kevin's girlfriend, Carrie are both killed.A little later, Wendy notices that every picture she took at the park gives a clue into how the next person will die and the order in which they will die based on who was sitting on the roller coaster.The next two are Ashley and Ashlynn. Two preppy cheerleaders, who show a little decency and invite Wendy to go tanning with them, although she is too depressed and turns them down. They go to tan and while the store owner steps out, the doors get locked, other things happen...BLAH BLAH BLAH and basically they get fried alive in the tanning bed.Next is Franky. He is a pervert who is actually two years older than all the other characters but just wants to see as many breasts as possible. While Kevin and Wendy are at a drive thru with Franky in front of them...a moving truck hits Wendy's door trapping her inside...nothing major. Well then another runaway truck comes plowing down the hill. Their truck is stuck between 3 vehicles and a building. Kevin manages to kick out the windshield and they climb out in a split second as the radiator fan from Kevin's truck takes off the back half of Franky's head.The next to die is Lewis. At this point, Wendy and Kevin realize the pictures hold the clue to the death and they find Lewis in the weight room. His picture shows two swords in the background and above one of the weight benches is two swords. Some more stuff happens and somehow, the swords come lose and almost cut off Lewis's head...but he escapes. Thinking he just cheated death he lays back down on the weight machine not realizing the safety wires had been cut by the swords. He lifts the weights and BAM smashes his head in between them.Ian and Erin are the next two, although it is unclear who is next. While at the hardware store where they work at...a forklift gets something dropped on it causing it to go. In the end Wendy notices a bunch of wooden stakes above Ian which is similar to his picture. She tries to move him out of the way and everyone gets crushed my plywood and ladders. Erin slips on some anti-freeze and falls back onto a nail gun having her hand nailed to her face and about 15-20 nails go through her skull.At this point, they know Ian is before them still but so are some other people yet to be determined. After reviewing a picture, she realizes it is her sister Julie and her friends. At the Tri-Centinnial celebration, a horse gets loose and the stake wraps around Julie dragging her nearly into a piece of farm equipment but Kevin cuts the rope at the last second. Thinking it is OK, the horse goes crazy again sending a flag flying through the air and it goes right through Julie's best friend. Everyone is freaking out.Then they run into Ian. He realizes he is the only one left before the others and at this point believes Wendy caused Erin's death. He thinks if he kills Wendy it will all end. However, early in the fair, a trailer containing fireworks had the support rod knocked loose and the fireworks go off right towards Ian. None hit him and he laughs thinking he can't die and all of a sudden, the crane holding up a sign above him collapses smashing him in half.Five months later, Wendy has a new boyfriend and a new roommate in a new city. While on the subway, she notices Kevin. Then runs into her sister Julie who was coming to visit. She has some more visions of the train crashing and everyone dying. Moments later it really happens supposedly and the movie ends in black with the sound of a train crash.This movie as I mentioned is by far the best of the three and if you can stand all the blood and gore...I highly recommend it.",Final Destination 3
575,jonrene,Great Teen Movie,9,25 March 2006,"I really liked this movie,and how its a teen movie..thats another reason why I liked the first one more then the second,because the second one had no teens except Kimberly,(the teen dude doesn't count)...basically only the first and third one had teens in it,and thats why i liked it.But I really liked the deaths in this one as well,in the other movies there aren't many deaths,in this one there is plenty,I'm sure every one enjoyed the tanning bed scene,it was o.k but I liked Erins death scene..even though she didn't have any gore in it. The beginning was really good as well,but they mostly have them just falling off the rollarcoaster,and getting hit by some of the parts.The ending was the best out of all the other endings,especially the ending to the 2nd one(wasn't a really good movie)..I'm not saying they should make a 4th one,but they should tell what happens to Wendy and Kevin. Its a great movie and if you haven't seen it...hurry(its coming out on DVD soon)",Final Destination 3
576,up_yours1200,"Excellent, best film of the year",9,17 March 2006,"I went to view the film Final Destination 3 (2006) and my first initial impression was that it was a very carefully planned out series of events, but after careful study with an associate of mine we found that in the beginning, the character Wendy Christensen played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead has a premonition about Frankie Cheeks played by Sam Easton in which he drops the video camera on the tracks ahead and the coaster crashes. But, after her premonition she creates a fuss and the whole of the back carriages all get out, this includes Frankie Cheeks following the two hot girls (with his camera in his hand). Now, this just poses the question doesn't it, WHAT THE F**K IS GOING ON? So in effect, the whole film shouldn't have even happened. HAHA! But on the whole, an excellent film.",Final Destination 3
577,sonny_devil,Great movie once again,7,23 March 2006,"final destination 3 was a great movie, the roller coaster seen at the beginning gets you straight into the movie.The reason i gave the movie a 7 because the movie and plot was very good, but it did not include much follow up from final destination 1 and 2. The characters in the film did not know much about air-plane crash, or the pile up on the motorway in the first and second of the series. Which i found a bit silly.but yeah the overall film is a good one, its a must watch movie, incredible effects, shots, and clever ways of getting KILLED!! But remember after watching this film do not go to a tanning salon!!!lol",Final Destination 3
578,laura1237,Predictable,6,26 March 2006,"I've got to say, I was disappointed with Final Destination 3. It lacked emotion, and i ended up laughing rather than being scared. The acting was a poor, but overall the storyline was quite good. It was a really predictable movie, and at some points, too slow, but it did, surprisingly have its good bits. The deaths were original, and sometimes comical(not that they should be), and the characters were interesting. Some of the scenes were a little too tense for me and i did jump from my seat a few times. Although, this didn't make it live up to the standard of Final Destination 1 and 2, but it is a must see for anyone who likes teen thrillers. It could have been better if a few more well-named actors were in it like the previous films.",Final Destination 3
