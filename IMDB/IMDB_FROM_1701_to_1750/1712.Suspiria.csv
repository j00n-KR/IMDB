0,MartinHafer,cheap and dumb but STILL very chilling and well worth seeing,8,17 August 2005,"This movie looks pretty cheap and silly throughout. It is so amazing to me, then, that despite this and the rather predictable plot at times, the movie is so effective at scaring the viewer. So, it isn't really the plot, the acting or the special effects that make it a good film. Instead, the director, cinematographer and musical director deserve the kudos as the movie builds and builds and builds in intensity thanks almost completely to lighting and a suspenseful (though somewhat repetitive) score. Together, they create a visceral reaction that transcends the plot and acting--almost as if your mind is unaware of the terror while your body begins to react strongly with a quickening pulse and nerves that are on end.",Suspiria
1,Leofwine_draca,Insanely gory and nightmarish Italian horror,10,3 January 2017,"Many people consider this to be Dario Argento's finest film and it is indeed a very accomplished piece of work. Argento's use of technique is second to none and he ably succeeds in creating a visually stunning film in which the basic plot is not important but the flair with which key moments are played out is everything. I thought the film was very successful in what it was trying to do; that is, build up a nightmarish dream world. Like Fulci's THE BEYOND, SUSPIRIA is a surreal film in which nothing is what it seems, and packed with horrific images.The plot is rather simplistic and merely serves as a linkage between the graphically gory set pieces, and in this respect it's a surprise that the film has been re-issued uncut in this country (many of key moments are truly gut-wrenching). In this respect it differs from a lot of Argento's other work, films which have mainly been firmly-footed in the giallo genre. There are a number of excellent scenes in SUSPIRIA which stand out as high points of '70s cinema, and indeed in the horror genre as a whole: Argento really knows how to terrify his audience.Some of the acting here is rather forced, and not especially brilliant. My main issue would be with the heroine, Jessica Harper, somebody who I didn't really take to during the film's course, but of course this is just a personal preference. Some of the dialogue scenes are a bit unintentionally funny which detracts from the film somewhat, but thankfully these moments are few and far between. Who can forget a professor's theory that ""bad luck isn't a product of broken mirrors - but of broken minds""? Like just about all of Argento's earlier movies, SUSPIRIA has great photography in which primary colours are highlighted and mixed into some stunning compositions on screen - just look at the setting of the murder at the film's opening, with the stained glass roof panels. Argento really knew how to put his cameras to their best use. Like Sam Raimi, the director is always looking for different and unsettling camera angles, and one that stuck in my mind is where we see Harper drinking a glass of wine in close up, not seeing her, but watching the glass tipping and gradually emptying. It's an enchanting moment.As I mentioned before, there are a number of fantastically gruesome set pieces scattered throughout the film. The opening scene, where two girls are killed inside a giant hall, is truly spectacular, and must go down in horror movie history as one of the most visually accomplished moments of all time: Argento actually manages to make murder beautiful, an oxymoron if ever I heard one. The scene consists of a very brutal moment where a girl is stabbed over and over by an unseen supernatural killer (we see a bare arm plunging the knife into her chest), and then dropped through a glass roof and hanged. Pieces of falling debris also impale another girl below.The most cringe-worthy scene is where a girl falls into a room of razor wire, and struggles to escape but gets more and more wrapped up in it before her throat is brutally cut, this bit is really hard to watch (although what they were doing with a room full of razor wire...) A blind man also has his throat ripped out by his own guide dog, and Argento enjoys himself by launching a camera off a rooftop and having it swoop down towards his victim. The ending to this film was despised by some, but I personally liked it, and thought the witch's hideous gurgling/snoring was very disturbing, although the invisibility effect was a little unrealistic. And then it's time for the entire building to collapse and burn down, perhaps Argento had been watching a lot of Corman Poe films to get his inspiration here.The gore is exaggerated greatly, which may be a turn off for some. I'm not much of a prude when it comes to gore but here it really does go over the top and is hard to watch. For instance we see a knife blade plunge into a beating heart at one point, and another blade slash open someone's throat. These deaths are very extravagant, horrendous, and definitely not for the squeamish. The musical score is a highly important part of the film and used to build up terror very effectively: it's loud and pounding, relentlessly assaulting the viewer with a nightmarish din, thanks to The Goblin. Listen out for the frightening moments when ""witch!"" is shouted. I altogether this film is one of Argento's best, and contains everything that makes Italian cinema what it is, i.e. a firm grasp of style. A gruelling non-stop journey of horror for any self-respecting movie fan.",Suspiria
2,SnoopyStyle,brightly-colored bloody horror,7,10 August 2017,Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) follows her aunt's footsteps to attend a dance school in Germany. A girl runs away and is killed by a mysterious figure. Strange things happen at the school and Suzy faces innumerable dangers.Influential Italian horror director Dario Argento creates a good Euro horror fantasy. There are some good bloody splatter and nice brightly-colored set design. The plot is pretty simple. It is filmed in the slower traditional pacing although it does have some good thrills. It is different from the other horrors and it works.,Suspiria
3,Prismark10,Theatrical horror,6,29 September 2018,"The opening 20 minutes of Dario Argento's Suspira is a gem.You see specks of bright lurid colours but it is the dash of red that constantly stands out, letting you know that blood will soon flow.The moment Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) goes from the airport arrival halls to the sinister airport sliding doors to the windswept raining outdoors. You experience an audio-visual dazzle. Argento has thrown down a marker.That segment is finished with a Grand Guignol styled double death. One is a frenzied stabbing the other a shard of skylight glass.It is a shame that the rest of the film could not keep up to that standard. The fault lies with some choppy editing, not so good acting (I saw the subtitled version) and a weak story.Suzy Banyon has arrived in Germany to study ballet at a famous dance academy. However Suzy constantly feels tired and some of the student disappear which leads Suzy to investigate some bizarre behaviour. Suzy finds out more of the academy's Greek founder who was accused of being a witch.There is something surreal and nightmarish about Suspira. Although filmed in Italy, there were some location shots in Munich and a suggestion that the film alludes to the Nazi nightmare of the 1940s.",Suspiria
4,mark.waltz,The closest to opera or ballet that horror has ever come to.,10,11 September 2019,"There's a classy but scary elegance to this gorgeous but frightening horror film, one of the very best supernatural movie ever made and deliciously frightening. The bright colorful sets and photography are as much a star here as veteran actresses Joan Bennett and Alida Valli and young heroine Jessica Harper are. It's ten times better than ""The Exorcist"" and a rival to ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""The Omen"" as to its quality. While it has developed a large cult following, it still deserves to be made a classic, as they can't make em' any better than this.The movie starts off in a very intense thunderstorm with Harper arriving as a student at a famous dance school. She can't get in and spends the night with an old friend, arriving the next day to learn about the murder of one of the students in a horrific fashion which the audience gets to see. No killing in any of the ""Omen"" films can top that, nor the invasion of maggots in the school's attic or the other bizarre occurances. With the school's walls often turning blood red, it's apparent that there's something evil afoot, and it's much more complicated than the similar TV movies with occult themes such as ""The Devil's Daughter"", ""Satan's School For Girls"" and ""The Initiation of Sarah"".Veteran star Bennett is as glamorous as ever, a calming but mysterious presence amongst the horrors as the school's head mistress, and Valli is imperious and matron like as the head instructor. This is a horror film that keeps you completely rivited, combining its eerie colors with chilling music, art decco sets (straight out of grand opera) and tense pacing. It's joined the list of my favorite horror films, although it's very apparent that the first viewing will be quite an intense one. Don't start this one before you go to bed. It has the power of delivering nightmares that may awaken you in cold, clammy sweats.",Suspiria
5,claudio_carvalho,The Masterpiece of Dario Argento,10,9 April 2005,"In a stormy night, the American dancer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) arrives in Freiburg coming from New York to join a famous and expensive ballet school for a three-year training. On the next morning, she is informed by the direction of the school that a student she met leaving the place on the previous night was violently murdered and the police is investigating the crime. She becomes friend of another student, Sara (Stefania Casinia), and she realizes that the house is indeed a coven of evil and destructive witches led by the powerful Helena Markus, the Black Queen, who has a tremendous talent for doing evil. It took me twenty-eight years to have the chance for watching ""Suspiria"". This masterpiece of Dario Argento has never been released on VHS in Brazil, and only a couple of months ago a new Brazilian distributor released this magnificent double DVD, recorded on DTS and having lots of extras, including a documentary about Dario Argento. ""Suspiria"" is outstanding, and has exceeded my best expectations: the story is excellent, its atmosphere recalls a nightmare, with the amazing use of strong bright colors and the soundtrack from the Italian band Goblin is very scary. The cult actress Jessica Harper has another great performance and her character Suzy seems to be trapped in a nightmare. I certainly include ""Suspiria"" among my favorite horror movies and I only regret the time I have missed without having the chance of watching this stunning work of one of my favorite directors. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Suspiria""Note: On 08 July 2013, I saw this movie again.On 02 December 2016, I saw this film again.",Suspiria
6,kosmasp,One of Argentos best,7,19 February 2007,"I've watched quite a few movies of the director Argento. I wouldn't say that I'm a big fan of his. Nonetheless this movie delivers. It's frightful as it should be. The acting is solid enough (which you can't say about all of his movies).Although you can see many things here that Argento used later in his newer more recent films too (such as the hand that is in front of the camera ... which many will know is Argentos own hand) this one is enjoyable to watch. The horror & gore stuff works here pretty fine, but you shouldn't be ""faint of heart""! There are better horror movies out there (imo), but this is a good one too!",Suspiria
7,gavin6942,Argento's Masterpiece and What Italian Horror Should Be,8,18 June 2007,"A young American woman join a ballet school in Germany. Rumors are circulating that the school is the secret coven of the great witch Helena Markos. As girls from the school die off violently one by one, this rumor seems more and more plausible.Although only one Argento film is listed in the Internet Movie Database's Top 50 horror films (""Deep Red""), ""Suspiria"" is the one widely considered his classic. After seeing it, I'm not the least surprised (until now, I was only familiar with his new material -- ""Jennifer"" and ""Pelts""). The rich colors of this film, the surreality of it and the moving soundtrack (with a theme more haunting than even ""Jaws""). While the film is now dated, anyone who doesn't mind a film with lower picture quality should enjoy this movie.The tagline reads, ""The Only Thing More Terrifying Than The Last 12 Minutes Of This Film Are The First 92."" I'm not really sure what that's supposed to mean -- they are implying the end is boring compared to the rest of the film? Actually, the whole movie is quite good. Some parts are slower, and there is a lot of character development, but this is by no means a bad thing. When the murders happen, they really happen -- with the first girl being dragged through a window, stabbed repeatedly, and then hung after she was already quite dead.Udo Kier makes a cameo here, though his part is much smaller than I would have liked (I barely was able to see his dazzling blue eyes). The lead actress (Jessica Harper, I think her name is) was amazing, but everyone else was just ordinary. Yet, this worked well... I wasn't distracted by stars and really got into the film itself.Seeing a Dario Argento film is especially pleasant after recently watching Lucio Fulci's ""City of the Living Dead"". With all due respect to Fulci, the Italian horror master is Argento. Fulci drags, his film quality is atrocious, and although he loves gore as much as anyone, doesn't deliver the way Argento does. I really look forward to watching Argento's ""Inferno"" in the near future.I am recommending this film. You have gore, a good plot, a great soundtrack... and it's a classic you really ought to be familiar with if you're a horror fan. If you enjoyed Lucky McGee's recent film ""The Woods"", I think you'll enjoy this. The movies are very different but have some similar central plot themes. I love both films quite a little bit, though in a different way. Pick this one up.",Suspiria
8,lee_eisenberg,children's stuff meets terror,10,11 January 2021,"If you know any of Dario Argento's movies, then you should have an idea of what ""Suspiria"" entails. However, unlike most of the giallo genre, Argento's focus on a dance academy that isn't what it seems incorporates elements of fairy tales. With color schemes based on Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarves"", and door handles higher than usual, there's a real feeling of children's stuff here. Mind you, there ARE quite a few shocking scenes. Those, plus the eerie soundtrack and cinematography, affirm this as a must-see masterpiece of Euro-horror. That Argento thought to cast Jessica Harper after seeing her in Brian DePalma's ""Phantom of the Paradise"" is another credit to DePalma's movie.",Suspiria
9,jboothmillard,Suspiria,7,26 April 2009,"I saw an image or two from this horror film from Italy, and it featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I wasn't going to miss it. Basically young American dancer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) travels to Germany to attend a famous ballet school. After arriving she sees a young woman appearing to be fleeing, and unknown to anyone, she is gruesomely murdered by a hideous creature, and her friend is impaled. Suzy meanwhile is trying to settle at the school, but hears strange noises and is seeing things. Later, she discovers there is more to the murder than most think, there is talk of witches and stuff, and it turns out that all teachers are exactly that. Also starring Joan Bennett as Madame Blanc, Alida Valli as Miss Tanner, Udo Kier as Dr. Frank Mandel, Flavio Bucci as Daniel, Stefania Casini as Sara, Miguel Bosé as Mark and Rudolf Schündler as Prof. Milius. The opening scenes of violence with the girl stabbed and hung, and her friend impaled grabbed my attention very quickly. The rest of the film (available dubbed) is filled with good pounding music, more moments of violence and an interesting use of bright colours, making it a pretty unforgettable experience. It was number 62 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!",Suspiria
10,Woodyanders,Dario Argento's tour-de-force of in-your-face horror,9,11 April 2008,"Sweet innocent American ballet student Suzy Banyon (a strong and sympathetic performance by the lovely Jessica Harper) goes to a fancy European dance academy that's plagued by a series of bizarre events. Suzy investigates the strange happenings and discovers that something sinister is afoot within the bowels of the school. Director Dario Argento, who also co-wrote the deliciously macabre script with then wife Daria Nicolodi, does his usual masterful job of creating and maintaining a very potent and palpable sense of absolute flesh-crawling dread. Moreover, Argento stages several set pieces with his customary bravura flair: the breathtakingly brutal opening double murders, maggots falling from the school ceiling, blind pianist Daniel (Flavio Bucci) having his throat torn out by his own seeing eye dog, the especially nasty sequence in which the snoopy Sara (the luscious Stefani Casini) falls into a room full of barbed wire (ouch!), and the bloodcurdling conclusion. Luciano Tovoli's dazzling, gliding, sparkling vibrant cinematography and Goblin's wild, howling, wonderfully freaky and frightening full-bore rockin' score make this film a total sensory feast for the eyes and ears alike (Tovoli's photography in particular is highly impressive with its occasional overhead camera shots and striking use of the color red). Harper shines in the lead role; she brings a winning blend of pluckiness and vulnerability to her part. Joan Bennet lends excellent support as the classy headmaster Madame Blanc and Alida Valli contributes a memorably icy portrayal as stern dance instructor Miss Tanner. Better still, a bevy of beautiful young ladies play the extremely catty and competitive students attending the school. Udo Kier has a brief, but neat cameo as helpful psychiatrist Dr. Frank Mandel. My sole criticism is that the big surprise climactic revelation about the school's big dark secret frankly ain't that startling (it's not a good idea to have someone on the soundtrack repeatedly hiss the word ""witch"" over and over again throughout the whole picture!). Essential viewing for horror fans.",Suspiria
11,ccthemovieman-1,Horrible Dialog & Dubbing Made This A Dud,2,20 August 2006,"Some bring, interesting colors made this film fun to watch in spots and some of the violence was memorable. However, the dialog is so stupid and the dubbing so amateurishly done that you will not want to wade through all 98 minutes of this Italian film, at least on VHS.It was interesting to see classic film star Joan Bennett as an older woman. I had only really seen her in films of the 1940s. It's too bad her career near the end was in schlocky films like this!This horror story, featuring witches, is not usually my cup of tea but I could see where this would have been a very interesting film had made some changes in the dialog and did a better of dubbing. Better to have just gone with the subtitles.",Suspiria
12,Tweekums,A classic horror which stands the test of time,9,12 April 2018,"Suzy Banyon is a young American ballet dancer who has just enrolled in a prestigious ballet school in Germany. It doesn't begin well; she arrives on a rainy night and is turned away just as an expelled student is departing; later that night that student is murdered. The next day Suzy returns and is welcomed although things soon start going badly again as she collapses, bleeding from her nose and mouth. More strange things happen; the school's sleeping quarters suffers a maggot infestation, the blind pianist is savaged by his guide dog after being fired and Suzy's roommate vanishes soon after they discuss investigating some of the strange goings on. Suzy starts to consider the possibility of supernatural causes as she learns more about the school and its history. The danger increases as she gets closer to the truth.This film from director Dario Argento certainly stands the test of time; over forty years on and it still has the power to shock. The only thing that might be considered slightly dated is the vivid colour of the spilt blood although it can be argued that this fits in with the films distinctive colour palette. The use of colour is dominant throughout as vivid colours are present all the time; most notably deep reds and blues but also similarly intense greens and yellows at times; these colours add to the sense of unease as well as creating a strange fairy tale feel. The music, by 'Goblin' also does an impressive job adding to the atmosphere. There aren't a huge number of deaths but those that do occur are pretty shocking and quite grisly. Jessica Harper does a really good job as Suzy and is ably supported by the rest of the cast. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to horror fans; it is certainly more disturbing than most horror films that I've seen.",Suspiria
13,ma-cortes,"Magnificent Giallo with imaginatively staged murders by the master of horror, the great Dario Argento",8,22 April 2015,"An American newcomer called Suzy (Jessica Harper , hired after her debut in Brian De Palma's Phantom of Paradise 1974) arriving in Europe during a storm , she goes to a fancy ballet academy run by Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and Madame Blanc (final film of Joan Bennett) ; later on , she becomes involved into grisly murders . As there happens several murders with bloody and creepy executions . Meanwhile, the series killer goes on a real massacre on various unfortunate victims in a string of loathing murders . Suzy gradually comes to realize that the school is a front for something far more sinister and supernatural amidst a series of gruesome killings . Slowly more people are found dead and she deals with a psychologist (Udo Kier), expert on witchery . As Suzy investigates the strange killings committed by a mad murderous running amok and with numerous suspects .¨Suspiria¨ is a nice Giallo full of heinous killings , suspense and bizarre intrigue . Dario Argento's great success is compelling directed with startling visual content and rich color palette . This stylish movie is plenty of thrills , scary happenings , high body-count and strange color with phenomenal results . From the beginning with the frightening atmosphere-laden credit titles as well as opening to finish taking place merciless terror and relentless horror , all of them assaulting the audience . This is a classic slasher where the intrigue , tension , suspense appear threatening and lurking in every room, corridors and luxurious interior and exterior ; including lots of thrills , chills and spills are so fast and classy . Creepy as well as interesting screenplay by Argento and Daria Nicolidi , Dario's wife ; being inspired by book ""Suspiria De Profundis"" written by Thomas De Quincey . Thunderstorms and impressively grotesque killings pile up , they are extraordinarily staged . The movie belongs to Italian Giallo genre that was invented by Mario Bava (Black Sabbath) along with Riccardo Freda (Secret of Dr. Hitchcock) , they are the fundamental creators . These Giallo movies are characterized by overblown use of color with shining red blood , ordinary zooms , and utilization of images-shock . Later , it appears maestro Dario Argento with his typically stylish Giallos , he is another essential creator of classic Latin terror films . Argento's over-the-top direction is well crafted , and as always more inclined towards violence and lots of killings . The terror pieces are well created with eye-opening flair-play and contain obscure tracks to the denouement of the script . This is the first part with ¨Inferno¨ (1980) and ¨Mother of tears¨(2007) of a trilogy of films about the ""Three Mothers"" . This genuinely mysterious story is well made and results to be one of the best ¨Giallo¨ with oneiric , effective aesthetic ; it packs baroque over-decoration , lots of gore , guts and twists plots . This is a trademark terror work for the Horrormeister Argento with high tension quotient and equally high suspense by means of an ever-fluid camera that achieves colorful shots . Noteworthy for intelligent edition work that tightens the mystery , glimmer use of color by awesome cameraman Luciano Tovoli and distinctive utilization of stylized images . Being the first Italian film to make use of the then newly invented Steadicam . Sometimes weak screenplay is enhanced by nice but gory special effects . Screeching musical score by Goblin with stereophonic whispers combining to fortissimo soundtrack , heavy-breathing blasts in stereo adding help achieve incredible ghastly moments and including hard rock all dissociation . The voice heard whispering on the bizarre soundtrack by Goblin is that of Goblin band member Claudio Simonetti , it is just gibberish . Even director Dario Argento composed the creepy music with the band Goblin and played it at full blast on set to unnerve the actors and elicit a truly scared performance . The motion picture shot over four months was originally directed by Dario Argento, at his best , he is one of those film-makers who set off simple for frightening us to death . His films display a sharp eye for the bizarre and he usually abandons plot mechanics to provide a bravura display of his technical skill . Argento often uses a particular trademark : Murder victim crashes through window and characters recall clues from memory . His period of biggest hits were the 70s when he directed the animals trilogy : ¨Four flies over gray velvet¨ , ¨The cat of nine tails¨ , ¨Bird with the crystal plumage¨ . They are always riveting to watch , after that , he directed ¨Suspiria¨, ¨Inferno , ¨Tenebre¨ and of course ¨Deep red¨ . In 1995 Argento made a comeback to the horror genre with ¨La Sindrome Di Stendhal (1996)¨ and then by another version of ¨The phantom of the Opera¨ (1998) both of which starred by his daughter Asia Argento . Most recently, Argento directed a number of 'giallo' mystery thrillers which include Insomnio (2001), ¨Il Cartaio (2004)¨, and ¨Ti Piace Hitchcock?¨ (2005), as well as two creepy , supernatural-themed episodes of the USA TV cable anthology series ""Masters of Horror"" . This bloody fun plenty of graphic gore and weirdness may not be for all tastes , but to be liked for Argento connoisseurs especially , as he relentlessly assaults his audience , you will feel real panic .",Suspiria
14,BA_Harrison,Argento should stick to Giallos!!,5,23 September 2006,"As much I enjoy most of Dario Argento's work, I can't bring myself to like Suspiria, his supernatural horror film about a coven of witches secretly living in a dance school. Often cited by fans as one of his greatest films, I fail to understand why so many horror buffs get so worked up about this rather uninteresting and muddled effort.Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American dancer who joins a strange dance academy where some gruesome murders have just taken place. Gradually, Suzy unravels the mystery surrounding the bizarre school and eventually comes face to face with the ancient evil that is hiding within.Opening with a wonderful scene in which Suzy emerges from an airport and is met by a torrential downpour, and followed soon after by two grisly and inventive deaths, Argento delivers a truly promising start to the film. Unfortunately, between this great beginning, and the fairly creepy finalé, the film consists of over an hour of ridiculous and very tedious drivel.I realise that much of the appeal of an Argento film lies in the stylish direction, and narrative usually takes a back seat to the visuals, but I found Suspiria to be equally lacking in both departments. The story leaves many unanswered questions (the main one for me being 'why would a coven of witches run a dance school?') and Argento's usual inventive camera-work is replaced by an excess of garish lighting (maybe he got a job lot of coloured bulbs cheap from somewhere). Furthermore, the soundtrack (by the usually reliable Italian rock band, Goblin), begins melodiously but soon descends into a migraine-inducing cacophony.Throw in a couple of truly laughable scenesone involving a clockwork bat attack and another with a victim inexplicably escaping into a room full of unwound spools of wire(!)and the result is a below-par effort from the usually impressive Argento.",Suspiria
15,moonspinner55,Comes together quite effectively after poor beginning,6,11 November 2017,"American ballet student Jessica Harper goes to Europe to attend famous dance academy, but the school is a front for a witches coven. Italian director Dario Argento's most successful thriller in the States (thanks to an effective ad campaign) is also his most derivative film up to this point, using several other movies as stylistic reference points. The elaborate look and ambiance of ""Suspiria"" is truly original, however, and Argento's use of color is striking; for those unable (or unwilling) to follow the plot, at least the picture provides a memorable visual experience. Harper has an appealing presence and a pithy way of speaking, though the supporting performances are uneven, often confounding and inscrutable. The mechanisms of the loosely-hinged story--usually the least-important aspect of an Argento picture--come together neatly at the finish line. Weaving a hypnotic web, Argento ensnares viewers with shock cuts but holds his audience with a rapt attention to atmospherics. **1/2 from ****",Suspiria
16,Quinoa1984,"Not bad luck, but bad minds. Quintessential Argento",10,27 February 2008,"Dario Argento is most brilliant at inviting his audience into a world soaked with the savage, bizarre, and somehow plausible while not making a whole lot of logical sense. Suspiria might be one of his masterpieces because he has such a firm control of the medium, but at the same time displays an uncommon enthusiasm for the art of cinema itself. He sticks to what horror fans love (or at least a good chunk of them) the most- skillfully paced and acted and shot and edited and scored and gored-up suspense/kill sequences, and an atmosphere that chills without going into the overboard that we've seen all too much lately in American horror. It's also a film that, unlike some of his others, actually isn't as illogical as possibly expected, mostly due to a good but crucial loophole - the supernatural, which provides a lot of leeway with gaps in logic or questions about motive, springing forth enough surreal imagination to outrank many an inferior Italian horror fright-fest.Jessica Harper stars as a woman who is going to a dance school, but there's something funny going on. Rather, not so funny: there's been two brutal deaths in one night, the same night Harper first arrives, where a sadistic killer has taken a frantic woman through the wringer and slain another woman equally frantic on the lower level. There's some foul play going on, with Harper getting drugged up each night and nodding out while the women in charge of the school seem to be up to ""something"". There's another death, a blind man by his own dog, and then Harper's good friend seems to have ""left without a trace"", but is really in the darker recesses of the school itself. What is going on? A coven of witches? A possible bad burial ground somewhere? Maybe more for the former it would seem, right out of legend and folklore and 19th century mythology. It's on! Right away we get here some of the Argento classic style: little talk, sharp music from Goblin that is like a mix of a music-box and 70s synth/metal with would-be supervision from John Carpenter. And the cinematography might be the most inventive and dazzling in color and depth and whatnot; I almost imagine Raoul Coutard circa Pierrot le fou was grafted on for the production and injected with a shot of Giallo-vision, and then instructed to provide, in most instances, the kind of measured shocks that have given Hitchcock the reputation he now has. Onward to the plot, if there is much of one, which as well seems to be not as silly as Phenomena or just whacked out like Opera, as there is some very solid line of character going through the proceedings (only a scene where Harper talks to an old expert on witchcraft drags, as any exposition in a genre film might lean toward without the best writing).And in scene after scene, sequence after sequence, Argento solidifies the reputation he has today when he is on top of his game. He's not afraid to go for some of the extra shots of gore or blood that have marked Italian horror the way it is in retrospect, but he's also classy about it. He piles on the artifice, the hyper-stylized lighting, the repetitive and sublimely indicative music, the cuts that seem to indicate little clues and hitting-on-the-head barbs of tension that combined with the performances (which, much like the style, could fit just as well in a super Gothic silent film) makes for a refined sensibility in approaching the genre. It's important to think of this as much, if not more-so, for the art-houses than the grindhouse or even cineplex.Something like this, if by some out-of-left-field chance of getting made today by a filmmaker free only to his desire for what he wants to see, was made to criticize the a genre often with a lack of any artistic depth for cheap, exploitive thrills (Argento was indeed a film critic at one time), and at the same time celebrate certain excesses an auteur can have with genre. How does a crazy movie like Suspiria, which alternates between the harrowing and gross (maggots) and absurd (blind piano player with dog) and even fluffy (dancing scenes) have celebration and joy and the like? If you have to ask, you'll never know.",Suspiria
17,wes-connors,Dancing with the Stars,7,16 November 2008,"American ballet student Jessica Harper (as Suzy Banyon) goes to study at a European dance academy, where grizzly murders and hungry maggots reign supreme. ""The Tanz Academy"" is fronted by elegant Joan Bennett (as Madame Blanc), with stern Alida Valli (Miss Tanner) well-suited, as head teacher. Chief among the young leotard set is Ms. Harper's relatively long-lived pal, lovely Stefania Casini (as Sara). As hair-raising events continue, Harper begins to suspect a coven of witches may have infested the dance Academy.The storytelling part of ""Suspiria"" is relatively weak, with events unintentionally serving to lesson the dramatic impact of the horror. The superb opening scenes, for example, are never really improved upon. Interesting characters are underdeveloped, and should have been more cleverly woven into the plot. Despite its haphazard script, and some obvious budget restraints, director Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" remains an excellent film.Mr. Argento's innovative, imaginative direction is the film's greatest strength. His cutting edge camera sense is often striking; and, the color photography, with Luciano Tovoli, is illuminating. The sharp soundtrack music, by the appropriately named ""Goblin"" band, is reminiscent of Mike Oldfield's ""Tubular Bells"". Ms. Bennett and Ms. Valli are a treat. The usually underutilized Bennett is especially noteworthy, in her only post-""Dark Shadows"" feature film appearance.Bennett accepted the project on the strength of the director's reputation, and a chance to visit Rome. When ""Suspiria"" appeared in the USA, she received some unwarranted poor notices, and professed dissatisfaction with the film's violent content. Still, Bennett was ""Saturn Award""-nominated as 1978's ""Best Supporting Actress"" for her work. Bennett duplicitously gives the ""Madame Blanc"" character just the right amount of respectability, or ""class""; she keeps her Academy dancers enrolled, and helps hold the slim story together.******* Suspiria (1977) Dario Argento ~ Jessica Harper, Joan Bennett, Alida Valli",Suspiria
18,BandSAboutMovies,Absolute perfection,10,24 May 2019,"I was afraid to write about this film here. What else can I say about it? My love for it as pure as the adoration you feel for your first love. This is what movies are all about to me: a dream world that is punctuated with staccato blasts of violence, neon and Goblin's never topped soundtrack. It took the remake of the film to get me to write down my feelings on this film.Suspiria is all about the impact that magic has on our world, a subject about which creator Dario Argento said, ""There's very little to joke about. It's something that exists."" The genesis for the film came from a trip through the ""Magic Triangle,"" the place where the countries of France, Germany, and Switzerland meet.The movie theorizes that if there are three Fates and three Graces, there must be three Sorrows: Mater Lacrymarum, Our Lady of Tears, Mater Suspiriorum, Our Lady of Sighs"" and Mater Tenebrarum, Our Lady of Darkness. This was inspired by a 19-century book by Thomas de Quincey called Suspiria de Profundis.Argento brought his wife Daria Nicolodi on that aforementioned trip and when he lamented that they hadn't seen a witch, she shared a story her grandmother, the French pianist Yvonne Müller Loeb Casella, had told her of an academy that she attended on the border between Germany and Switzerland that had a faculty that practiced black magic.While Argento claims that this story was false and other elements were more of the inspiration for the movie, Nicolodi feels otherwise. ""Suspiria was imagined and written by me, thanks to the fundamental inspiration of my grandmother's story,"" she said. ""Then, for the usual quibbles related to the cinema industry, this story was signed by both of us.""Even the end of the movie was inspired by a dream that Nicolodi had in which she encountered an invisible witch and then a panther exploded.While she was to originally star in the film, to make it more marketable to American audiences, Jessica Harper took over the lead. You can still see Nicolodi at the airport scene in the beginning and hear her as the voice of Helena Markos (supposedly, that's a 90-year-old ex-prostitute who Argento found on the streets playing that role).Suzy Bannion (Harper) is an American ballet student lost in Germany, arriving in a violent rainstorm and looking for her new school, the Tanz Dance Academy As she arrives, another student, Patricia, flee in terror. Despite the storm and her pleas over the intercom, no one will allow Suzy into the school. The cab drives her back to down as she watches Patricia run through the woods.Patricia finds her way to a friend's apartment but within moments, she's pulled out a window - Argento's biggest directorial signature - stabbed and then lynched through the apartment's stained glass skylight while her friend watches on, helplessly, before she's impaled by pieces of bloody stained glass.You might say, ""Wait, what is happening here?"" Argento isn't going to slow down or explain anything to you. What do you expect from one of the last movies shot in Technicolor and specifically lit to take advantage of the otherworldly colors that that film stock produced? Argento told cinematographer Luciano Tovoli that they were trying to make the film look like Disney's Snow White. In fact, he had to be talked out of making the students of the school all twelve years and under by his producer - and father - Salvatore Argento. Argento made the girls all around twenty years old but didn't rewrite their dialogue, which is why they act so naive and their dialogue is so childlike. Next time you watch this movie, notice the doorknobs. They were placed at the same height as the actress' heads so they would have to raise their arms to open them. All so they would really be children, not adults.The next morning, Suzy goes back to the school where she meets the headmistress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett in the final role of her career) and Miss Tanner (Alida Valli, who is also in Argento's Inferno). She's supposed to stay with Olga (Barbara Magnolfi, The Suspicious Death of a Minor), but she's kicked out in moments and must return to the school. There are some scenes cut from the film that reveal that Olga is probably a witch in training, hence why she plays with Suzy so much.The next day, Suzy starts her classes but quickly grows dizzy. Then, she becomes friends with Sara (Stefania Casini, The Bloodstained Shadow). Later that evening, when the girls are getting ready for dinner, maggots rain from the ceiling. Again - why? Supposedly its just rotten food, but it feels like something much more sinister is happening, especially when Sara notices the academy's director wandering the halls late at night and hiding behind the curtains.Can things get worse? Sure they can. The school's blind piano player is killed by his own dog. And just as Suzy remembers that Patricia had uttered the words ""secret iris"" to her, she passes out just as a man enters her room, chasing Sara through a series of rooms until she becomes entangled in barbed wire before the black-gloved man decides that this is now a giallo and slits her throat. This was an incredibly painful scene for Casini to shoot, as even though the barbed wire was fake, it still entangled and tore at her skin.Suzy learns from Sara's friend Dr. Frank Mandel (Udo Kier!) that the school had been established by Helena Markos, a woman that everyone in town believed was a witch. She is now dead, the victim of a fire, and another of Mandel's friends, Professor Milius (Rudolf Schündler, Karl from The Exorcist and Father Conrad from Magdalena, Possessed by the Devil, one of the scummiest possession movies you will ever see) believes that her coven is suffering without her as their leader.Suzy returns to the school and discovers that she is alone. She follows the sound of footsteps to Madame Blanc's office, where a mural of irises opens a secret door. Entering this passage, she overhears the Blanc and the teachers plotting her doom. And then, running from Blanc's nephew Albert and his servant, she finds Sara's body.As Suzy hides in a room, she discovers that Helena Marcos is sleeping there. As the witch awakens, she possesses Sara's body and come after Suzy to kill her. A flash of lightning reveals where Marcos is hiding and Suzy stabs her through the neck with a giant neon peacock quill - quite literally The Bird with the Crystal Plumage - and kills the old woman. The entire school begins to burn and fall apart around her, killing the teachers who had just been planning to kill her. As Suzy escapes into the rainy night, she pauses to smile. I absolutely adore this scene, this moment of survival, this brief bit of exhilaration. Suspiria is quite literally a haunted house ride and our heroine has survived.The Italian band Goblin - credited as The Goblins - composed the score along with Argento before the movie was filmed. Of note are the hushed whispers of Claudio Simonetti, who has said that that much of what he says in the songs is nonsense.I've gone on record numerous times about my hatred for the remake of this film. But I want to use this time to talk about what this movie is, not what that one isn't. Everything magical about film is within these 98 minutes. Instead of worrying about narrative cohesion and things making sense, I find it best to just sit back and let Suspiria take you somewhere amazing. You'd do well to watch this movie with that in mind.",Suspiria
19,Coventry,Stylish slaughtering and colorful brutality,6,23 January 2004,"Often regarded as Argento's finest achievement, Suspiria is at the top of the horror industry. Yet, I don't fully agree with this statement. No doubt that this film is technically superior to almost every other horror film and it breathes a truly horrifying atmospherebut, like in so many other Argento movies, the plot and dialogues are second to the diabolical surrounding. If Dario would ever find the perfect balance between storyline and technique, his films would be true masterpieces. Suspiria is a visually stunning cinema experience. You're just being overwhelmed by the colorful decoration and the blasting thunderstorms. The film makes terrific attempt to build up an unbearable tension but, as the viewer, the silly and far-fetched plot constantly limits you feelings of fear and threat. The whole movie might be a bit overrated, and it's definitely hyped too much. Nonetheless, Suspiria is essential viewing for every self-respecting horror fan because of a few irresistible aspects. The gore and bloody sequences, for example, are perfect representations of Argento's wild and twisted imagination. There aren't that many massacres in Suspiria, but the one you do get see will haunt your mind a long time after you finished watching this film. These killing scenes are shot typically Argento: rough camera movements and raw, explicit close-ups of pure violence and terror. Other than this, there's the haunting soundtrack, supported by the excellent use of (un)natural  sound effects. The most `horrifying' aspect remains the dubbing, thoughpleasant films like this almost get entirely spoiled by the poor dubbing. For your own good try not to pay too much attention to this!",Suspiria
20,michaelRokeefe,Dance the dance demonic.,3,1 October 2005,"I was slightly disappointed considering Dario Argento's reputation. It is said SUSPIRIA may be the best Italian horror flick. The story line is not really clear at times and definitely not obvious. Special effects are pretty gory and the music is really good and sets a scary atmosphere. The opening sequence is a bit mysterious, but makes sense when the finale plays out. To be exact, the final fifteen minutes or so are the best of the whole movie. The sets resemble nothing I've seen before. Shadows usually nurture fear.An American dancer enters a renowned European ballet academy to waltz into an eerie situation. A secret door is opened and leads to the discovery that the staff is a wicked coven with intentions of gaining converts. It is sensed the newcomer must be eliminated and become part of the ever growing body count.

21,Hey_Sweden,"""You're going to meet death now...the LIVING DEAD!""",9,1 April 2018,"The lovely and appealing Jessica Harper stars in this horror classic as Suzy Bannion, an American ballet dancer who travels to Europe to study and train. Arriving at the German school known as Tam Academy, she soon witnesses various strange goings-on, and comes to a horrifying realization regarding the identities and motives of the top dogs at this school.""Suspiria"" ranks as the personal favorite Dario Argento film for this viewer, and is definitely one of his most famous. The story, concocted by Argento and his former partner / sometime leading lady Daria Nicolodi, isn't necessarily a great one, but then great storytelling has never been Argentos' true strong suit. It's not what you watch his films for; you watch them for the virtuoso filmmaking, and it's on full display here.One thing you notice right away is how powerful the film is visually. It's a marvel of eye-popping images, colorful lighting choices, and fluid camera work. Certainly cinematographer Luciano Tovoli plays a big part in why this film works as well as it does.Overall, it's a stunning if not perfect marriage of stifling atmosphere, the beautiful brutality that hardcore horror fans crave, the dark and twisted nature of many a fairy tale, and the sometimes overpowering but compelling music score by renowned Italian prog-rock group Goblin. It features an amazing murder set piece within the first dozen or so minutes, and rarely lets up until an abrupt but creepy finale. Some scenes in ""Suspiria"" are iconic and have burned their way into the minds of its audiences over the decades.The performances are generally engaging: Ms. Harper, 40s icon Joan Bennett, Italian character actress Alida Valli, the great German cult actor Udo Kier, the distinctively featured Giuseppe Transocchi, handsome Miguel Bose, Stefania Casini (playing Suzy's new friend Sara), and sultry Barbara Magnolfi as the sardonic Olga.Well worth watching for any horror fan, especially now that the film has been restored and the picture looks more gorgeous than ever.Nine out of 10.",Suspiria
22,Doylenf,Nothing more than pretentious horror schlock...,4,9 October 2006,"This ranks with some of the worst stylized horror films, even worse when you watch the dubbed version. Makes you wonder how an actress like JOAN BENNETT lent herself to this sort of shlock toward the end of her career. VALLI doesn't do much better in this tale of a young woman (JESSICA HARPER) who discovers that she's entered a ballet school where girls fall victim to vicious crimes (involving horrific mutilation) because the place is actually a front for a coven of Witches.At least that's what I was able to understand of the so-called plot, which exists for the sole purpose of exhibiting as many gruesome deaths in loving detail as possible.At the same time, the settings are overlit in garish colors, loud music by The Goblins fills the soundtrack, and you know the heroine is in danger whenever too much red appears on the screen. That's a signal that more bloodletting is about to take place. So much for subtlety.Dario Argento has filmed the whole thing on bold, fake looking sets with crooked camera angles, using color to create a campy, surreal looking atmosphere, and lots of carnage. You almost expect Salvador Dali to step from the wings and take a bow for the stylized sets.You won't know whether to laugh or cry at the crudeness of it all. As one critic said, between nervous giggles, ""There are interludes where no one is actually bleeding.""",Suspiria
23,preppy-3,Superb horror film,10,29 October 2005,Susie Bannon (Jessica Harper) goes to a dance academy in Germany to study. It turns out its run by a witches coven and they'll kill anybody who threatens them...That's about it for plot. There IS a plot but it jumps all over the place...but it doesn't matter. This movie is fascinating just to look at and hear it. The settings are truly bizarre and done in eye-popping color. They're complimented by the excellent use of color and lighting. Also the group Goblin contributes to it a downright terrifying and LOUD score which really starts to work on you. The murder scenes are graphic--VERY graphic. The opening double murder is shocking and bloody. There are many great sequences that you just look at in wonder HOW this was done. My favorite is when Sarah (Stefania Casini) is being stalked through the academy late at night by an unseen evil force.Director Dario Argento has made a true masterpiece of horror. Its short on plot but the visuals and music more than make up for any of its drawbacks. The acting is good--especially by Joan Bennett (obviously enjoying herself) and Alida Valli who just LOOKS scary...especially those teeth of hers. Harper is also very good considering she was acting opposite people who didn't speak English! The poor dubbing is a little distracting but this is still a horror masterpiece. A must-see. TRY to see it in a theatre.Try to see the uncut Italian print. The R rated US version cuts most of the violence and even edits out sequences that explain the plot!,Suspiria
24,poolandrews,Visually fantastic but conceptually poor.,7,20 August 2008,"Suspiria starts one stormy night in Germany as American dancer Susan Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in Munich to enrol in the world famous ballet school the Frieberg Dance Academy. Once there Susan sees another student named Pat Hingle (Eva Axén) running from the academy, some time later at her friends apartment Pat is viciously murdered. The next morning & the police question various students & teachers at the academy & Susan realise that she was the last person to see Pat alive the night before. Thinking about the chance meeting Susan remembers that Pat actually spoke to her when they passed each other but the loud thunder masked her words, deciding to investigate Pat's death & several other mysterious incidents at the academy Susan discovers that the academy was founded by an evil nineteenth century Witch named Elena Markos who may still be alive in the building doing evil Witch type things...This Italian produced fantasy horror film was co-written & directed by Dario Argento & stands out as one of his most visually impressive works, in fact Suspiria is one of the most sumptuous & best looking horror films out there in my humble opinion. Unfortunately while few could reasonably argue about Argento's style, imagination & competence as a filmmaker I personally think that few could argue successfully that Argento knows how to write films, construct plots that aren't ridiculous & flesh out character's beyond simplistic stereotypes. After an almost imperious start that oozes style, atmosphere, gore & an Argento trademark terrific set-piece murder it all goes downhill with a story & plot that really doesn't go anywhere or draw you in or engage in any satisfying way. In fact once the first impressive murder set-piece is out of the way little actually happens for what seems like an eternity, in fact it's around the hour mark before the next murder takes place & between the first & second murders not a lot happens. Then there's the Witchcraft exposition scene which has all the subtly of a sledgehammer, towards the end Susan visits some Witchcraft expert guy & in a scene which is there purely to get some exposition across & set up the instantly predictable twist ending this guy gives a long very forced sounding speech on Witchcraft & the academy in general. From that moment on you know, you just know how Suspiria is going to end. I appreciate that Aegento was trying to create some sort of abstract & weird environment & world in Suspiria but a lot of things from earlier in the film aren't addressed satisfactorily at the end, in particular the reason why so many character's act so oddly & weirdly is never really explained & the whole film ends up feeling silly & strange which is maybe what Argento wanted but I can't say I like it.The one area where Suspiria scores big points is in the style & cinematography departments. Suspiria quite simply looks fabulous from start to finish, the rich colour schemes, the precise framing of the shot & the silky camera movements all add up to make Suspiria a visual treat but whatever you do make sure you at least watch the full 2:35:1 widescreen version & if you can manage it an anamorphic DVD on a good widescreen telly since it really does look stunning at times. Symetery seems to play a big part in Argento's shots here, lots of shots are every symmetrical with panelling & wooden beams being repeated on both sides of the frame, big arch ways with exactly the same pot plant decorations either side & even the swimming pool featured has a perfectly symmetrical tile pattern at it's bottom. The colours are extremely rich consisting of neon reds & blues, there were times when I thought the wallpaper in certain rooms were made of velvet they look so textured. There's not too much gore here & relatively few death's, there's a stabbing & a close-up of a beating heart in a cut open chest being stabbed, a hanging, there's a brief slit throat, a guide dog bites his masters throat out & a large pin is stuck in someones neck. Special effects are good but why do filmmakers insist on using rubber bats? They always look awful!Shot on location in Germany & in the studio in Italy the film has good production values & looks fabulous but the story & plot are far less satisfying which is a shame. The film was completely dubbed (according to an interview with star Jessica Harper the film was shot like a silent film & only a couple of scenes had live sound shot) so the original performances are hard to judge & I found it very odd listening to Udo Kier in this, I instantly recognised his face but his voice is dubbed by someone who doesn't sound a bit like him.Suspiria is one of those films where style wins out over substance, I think it's a great film to sit down & watch on a purely visual level but the story & plot are noticeably weak & surely if Suspiria didn't look as good as it does & it wasn't directed by Argento no-one would ever have heard of it today. The Hollywood remake Suspiria (2010) is currently in development.",Suspiria

I've seen this film I don't know how many times and I have yet to feel the least bit of tension or terror. Nominally the story of an American ballet student (Jessica Harper) who goes to Europe to study at an exclusive ballet school that is actually a coven of witches headed by three ancient sisters. The film makes little sense with Argento going for a feeling more than sense. There is suppose to be a dream logic, but I don't see it, I see numerous brutal set pieces and a style and sense that was clearly designed by its director for effect. Its a directors film with every detail perfectly placed. Its a triumph for the technicians and a failure for anything else. the film simply isn't scary.

None more so than this atmospheric and frightening nightmare brought to life. There's an otherworldly fairy tale quality about it all. Argento uses lighting and color to create some very spooky visuals. The music score, by prog rock band Goblin, is insanely effective at building tension. There's a lot of violence but it's skillfully crafted. On the downside, the story doesn't always make sense and the performances are a little silly. Heavy on style but it's got plenty of scares, too.

A double-murder starts it flowing in the beginning of the film, and a zombie at the end is dripping it as you are constantly terrified throughout. The maggots were the most disgusting thing I have seen and I have never seen them used like this before.The music was outstanding and the sound was terrifying.

Featuring a soundtrack of grating ""goblin"" noise to distract viewers from the fact that ""there is no there here,"" SUSPIRA (1977) is simply a hodgepodge of American Horror staples mixed together like a poorly-tossed salad in a totally haphazard and half-hearted manner. Early on SUSPIRA (1977) sports a close-up of water swirling down into a storm gutter grate, causing viewers to guess they're in for killer clowns, along the lines of IT. If only. At 52:50, two coeds enter a gloomy swimming pool, readying watchers for a girl-chomping along the lines of JAWS and that Caribbean James Bond outing. No such luck.

30,evanston_dad,A Superb and Frightening Film,9,30 October 2006,"Visuals rule in Dario Argento's splendid fever dream of a movie, ""Suspiria."" The plot, which concerns a young American ballerina studying at a European school for dance and slowly discovering that it's run by a coven of witches, crumbles at even the slightest examination. And the film comes to a major anticlimax, and then just abruptly ends, leaving one to ask, ""Is that it?"" But everything leading up to the end is so stylishly directed, and much of it truly frightening, that the overall impression is of a remarkable fright film.Doing away with the usual dark, shadowy visual style of the typical horror films, Argento instead takes the opposite approach, and bathes everything in lurid, saturated color. The effect, rather than cheapening or diluting the scares, enhances them, because everything takes on a nightmarish and disorienting quality when there are so many colors and visual textures dominating the frames. He also uses an original score tremendously, rivaling that most memorable of horror film scores, the one John Carpenter created for ""Halloween."" (Notably, Argento wrote the music for his own film as well).There are many sequences in ""Suspiria"" that deserve to go down in horror film history: the opening sequence, of course, of which much has been said, but equally disturbing are the shower of maggots, the attack of the blind man in the middle of a deserted city square, and the final scene in which Jessica Harper's ballerina character stumbles into the bedroom of the head witch.The only strike against ""Suspiria"" is the extent to which it steals from ""Rosemary's Baby,"" both in plotting and in visual style. But Argento, while perhaps inspired by Polanski's film, deserves credit for making something completely unique of his own.Grade: A",Suspiria

Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion who arrives in Munich, Germany on a stormy evening. She cabs from the airport to the ballet academy but is refused entry. Beforehand she was met with a distressed female who flees through the forest. This results is a graphic yet chillingly effective double murder to open the film. Director Dario Argento makes great use of colour in all its exquisite captivating nature. Previous to this he made a another slasher called Deep Red. His screenplay comes to an abrupt halt in its third act as it does in Deep Red, leaving the need for possible explanation. Harper is an innocent as Suzy who is drugged to the point of passing out while dancing. She is warned by Sarah, played by Stefania Casini who speaks of witches and eventually finds herself stranded within a room floored heavily with razor wire. One major weakness is the obvious guilty gazes of the faculty. Instructor Miss Tanner is an overbearing less interesting version of Nurse Ratched or Miss Togar. Joan Bennett is even less interesting as Madame Blanc. Flavio Bucci as blind pianist Daniel is effective but meets a gruesome end via his seeing eye dog.

The first thing that most notice is that the movie is simply beautiful to look at, as nearly everything is filmed in shockingly bright colors with their continual reappearance being refreshing to see. The deep, dark reds and blacks, and the light, fluorescent blues and greens are quite in abundance here, giving the film an almost dream-like atmosphere. The film is journey through the world of dreams, offering many common themes and visions. As well, the constantly booming sounds that pop up everywhere in the film continually make the viewer on edge, and ends up drawing them into the story even more. Almost every scene in here has a sound of some sort, and most of the time it utterly jangles the nerves. There is a decidedly European style to the whole affair as well, mixed in with all the other wonderful attributes from the typical Argento brilliance on the camera to the way of telling a simple story, this is a European- centered approach in its most classic sense. When it wants to, it can also be as explosive and action-packed as it wants to. The opening double murder is as graphic and brutal as anything he's ever filmed, and in terms of opening a movie up, is arguably the greatest opening scene in movie history delivering one of the few rare shock jumps and is so creative in it's concept and shocking in it's realization that it has to be seen just solely on this sequence alone. However, unlike other films that start out with a great bang, the film rarely lets up, featuring such spectacularly grotesque and chilling moments of the maggots falling from the ceiling onto the girls, a truly chilling sequence of the blind worker getting attacked in the village square and one victim who stumbles upon the room containing the barbed-wire and becomes ensnared. These graphic scenes are all apart of the film's rather fun pace here with it stopping only for the usual exposition and character introductions before going right back into the discovery of the academy. That build-up here is another strong factor leading throughout here by giving this a truly engrossing mystery needing to be solved that's quite chilling once it's finally revealed. The greatly-hyped closing sequence is rightfully atmospheric and doesn't disappoint at all, giving this a great book-ended film opening and closing on very strong points. These here give this a lot to love about it though there's one main flaw to this one. The dreamlike atmosphere that it so wonderfully exploits also makes the film simply confusing for first-time viewers. It's purposely done that way as it wants to concentrate on the visual rather than telling a story as what happens is of little consequence only how it is told. Those who aren't used to that can sit through the film wondering what everything is about. It's all symbolically done, and that can be something to first time viewers to get through which is the only flaw.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Language.",Suspiria

36,Aaron1375,The first tale in the three witches trilogy.,7,19 August 2009,"Though I did enjoy this movie, I do go against the majority in liking ""Inferno"" the best of the three movies. I just like the kills better, there is more supernatural going ons in that movie too and it does not get as silly as ""Mother of Tears"" sometimes did. This movie though has the easiest plot to follow and is the most understandable of the three. Its conclusion is also better than ""Inferno"" as that movie had a conclusion that just came out of nowhere and ended rather abruptly. This movie has the setting of a ballet school and the plot has people being murdered mysteriously. The scenes in this movie are all very well done, having color schemes that make the ordinary look more menacing and really setting a dark and atmospheric tone. Not all scenes are like this as there are some outdoor scenes as the heroine of the movie tries to piece things together and figure out what is going on at the school. The ending is quite good, it too is a bit abrupt like the one found in ""Inferno"", however it makes more sense and you can follow what is going on better in this movie. A bit dreamlike is this movie, but not so much as ""Inferno"" and both of these two films trump ""Mother of Tears"" in the dreamlike quality of film as that film seems to rely on some rather cheap tricks like the ghost mother and it really pales in comparison to these two films as far as atmosphere. It probably has the best kills though so really each has something to offer.",Suspiria
37,The_Void,Dario Argento's hallucinogenic nightmare!,10,31 October 2005,"From the moment it starts, Suspiria's dazzling array of colours, potent musical score and inspired direction assure you that you're not in for merely another horror film - and the film certainly doesn't disappoint! Aside from the follow up; the severely underrated ""Inferno"", there really isn't another film like this one. Suspiria is often described as 'an all out assault on the senses', and while descriptions like this are often misguided and pretentious; that is not the case here. The pumping soundtrack courtesy of director Dario Argento's house band 'Goblin' interacts brilliantly with the colour scheme (borrowed from Walt Disney!) and the hallucinogenic chain of events to make a film that has a profound impact on an aesthetic level. Suspiria is definitely lacking in substance - but when the style element is so brilliantly done, who needs substance? The plot is like a modern day fairytale, and it follows a young girl by the name of Suzy Bannion, who travels to a German dance academy. From the moment she arrives, it soon becomes apparent that all is not quite right with the academy, and it isn't long before she's plunged into a world of witchcraft and murder, and decides to escape the academy.Suspiria is famous for it's gratuitous murder scenes, and, like the rest of the film - they don't disappoint. In fact, there is only three murder sequences in the film; the first being the one that attracts the most attention. Dario Argento directs as two girls are murdered simultaneously, and while the effects can be a little hokey, there's enough bright crimson blood to please any horror fan. The other two death sequences are extremely well orchestrated, and show great imagination. We get treated to a girl falling into a pit of barbed wire (...not everything here makes complete sense) and, best of all, a man eating dog! One that thing that Suspiria often receives criticism for is the fact that its plot is rather incoherent. This is a criticism that bears some weight, but I don't really see it as a flaw for the film. Suspiria isn't about plot details or making sense - it's a film that bypasses that stuff in favour of style and atmosphere, and it's these things that are always more important in a horror film. What Dario Argento and his co-writer (and girlfriend) Daria Nicoladia have done is cut out the less important elements and just given the audience what they turned up for. How can you criticise that? Suspiria is often mistaken for a slasher, and it receives a lot of criticism from people who have made this mistake. The murder scenes are few if you go into this film expecting a slasher, but it cannot be criticised for this because it isn't. Suspiria is hard to file into a certain genre or sub-genre; it's not quite Giallo, there's not enough witchcraft for it to be considered a witchcraft film, and it's certainly not a slasher; so since there's nothing else quite like it, I guess the film is in a category somewhere all on it's own. Dario Argento is often passed off as merely a splatter film director, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Argento movies get better with each viewing, and this is because repeated viewings enable to audience to fully appreciate the major talent that Dario Argento is. However, while his use of the camera is top notch; his ability to pull great performances out of his cast isn't. A few performers have turned in good performances in Argento films, but most don't and it seems that Argento doesn't care too much about acting in his films. Saying that, I don't care too much about it either.Suspiria is often regarded as Dario Argento's finest work, and it may well be. It's not my favourite Argento film; but it's up there, and when it comes to importance in the history of film, nothing else that the man ever made even comes close. Every horror fan needs to see the likes of The Exorcist and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre before they're a true fan; and Suspiria is certainly a member of that illusive list also. Consider that a high recommendation.",Suspiria
38,trashgang,classic,7,25 November 2014,"For so many horror buffs this is an instant classic but for others this is just a boring picture. I can agree on both parts. The story isn't that strong and there isn't that much of horror to spot but in the other hand the cinematography is stunning. And that due two reasons, the way it was shot and edited made it worth seeing and became a standard for Argento flicks, well back then, nowadays his flicks aren't worth picking up. The other reason is that by coincidence, the development of the film was done in a wrong way which turned out in saturated colours. And the mistake became the reason why so many people are seeing this as a standard. The use of red and green lighting saturated is still done nowadays. Naturally the blood looks extreme due the saturation which adds another positive note to Suspiria.But it isn't of course all hail to Suspiria. It is in fact low on gore and even when the murders are happening be sure that you watch the full uncut version as I did. It's only in that version that you see it in full glory. I also know that people seeing it for the first time didn't understand Suspiria. The reason lays in editing.The opening murder confuses the viewer, Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives at the Tanz Akademie. Before entering she notices Pat Hingle (Eva Axen) running in panic out of the school. Both standing soaking wet in the rain when Susy re-enters the taxi we move further to the killing of Pat, also soaking wet after running through the woods. It's there that a lot of viewers are thinking that actually Susy is being murdered.Suspiria is one of those flicks that is a must in every horror collection and being out these days restored on a 4 disc Blu Ray you just can't argue about picking it up.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Suspiria
39,HumanoidOfFlesh,An absolute masterpiece of pure horror. **Spoilers**,10,12 February 2001,"""Suspiria"" is the most beautiful,dreamlike horror film ever made.Jessica Harper stars as Suzy Banyon,a young ballet dancer studying at prestigious Tanzakademie in Freiburg,Germany.On the night of her arrival,a fellow student is chased by a demonic killer who stabs her repeatedly in the chest,finally piercing his knife into her exposed,still-beating heart.He then ties his victim with rope and she falls through a glass ceiling,hanging from her neck as a large shard of glass bisects another student standing below.The next morning Suzy meets the school's head Madam Blanc(Joan Bennett)and one of the teachers Miss Tanner(Alida Valli).Upon making friends with a girl named Sara(Stefania Casini),Suzy learns that all is not quite as it seems and the final truth is horrifying-the academy is a front of a coven of witches,headed by mysterious Mater Suspiriorum.The photography by Luciano Tovoli is brilliant,the musical score by synth rock group Goblin is simply outstanding.Dario Argento creates an atmosphere of horrific dread.Plenty of suspense plus some of the most shocking scenes of violence you'll ever see.Truly a masterpiece ""Suspiria"" is necessary viewing for anyone interested in horror movies.An absolute 10.",Suspiria
40,christopher-underwood,originally intended the girls be between the ages of eleven and fourteen,10,15 November 2017,"Another viewing of this marvellous, thrilling and beautiful film, this time a 4K restoration print at The Barbican, London and in the presence of the man himself - Dario Argento. A wonderful occasion with a packed audience of devoted fans who gave the man a welcome that seemed to catch him by surprise. It looks great, of course, and there were sections that I did not remember seeing or seeing so clearly. The maggots in the attic for instance and the shadows behind the temporary bed screens. The Goblins soundtrack was well to the fore and it was clear that in one or two instances it was the music itself that was creating the horror, with little actually happening visually. Dario spoke afterwards and was surprisingly perky, making little jokes and trying to provide more insight into the origins of the film. I had not heard before that Disney's, Snow White with its strong primary colours was a major influence and although I did know the story of his buying up the last stocks of the particular Technicolor film he wished to use, it was good to hear that this did not restrict the number of takes (lest he run out) because he did not use lots of takes. For me the most interesting revelation was that he had originally intended the girls be between the ages of eleven and fourteen, but that the backers wouldn't hear of it. It would have been even more effective with younger girls and does explain why some of the dialogue seems childlike.",Suspiria
41,siderite,"Weird European film, scary atmosphere",7,11 June 2005,"This is a funny little film, full with clichés, such as ""evil"" castle like buildings, ""evil"" bat in the hair (that finally ends squashed with a chair. I mean, who is evil here? ) and the ugly Romanian handyman (should I feel offended?). It is also full of clumsiness, by todays standards. However, the movie has innovation as well, succeeding to create a scary atmosphere that I feel was spoiled by the ""spooky"" soundtrack.The story is really irrelevant. What is important is the feel of the film. Heavy European architecture, mixed with windy rainy weather, all happening in a ballet school (that means many women put together, which just has to be scary) and an alternation of loud spooky music and complete lack of soundtrack.Funny little things in the movie: Udo Kier plays a short role and he is really young :). There is a scene that seems very much like the one in Hannibal (a girl is knifed and then hanged). There is a scene with a girl that tried to escape and lands in a mess of razor wire. That scene could have been a lot scarier.The interesting part comes in the last 10 minutes or so, where all the action takes place, but it brings no real climax. Conclusion: this is OK as a movie, but fails to capitalize on the story. It could have been done a lot better. Now, seeing that there is a 2005 Suspiria project, I wonder if it is a remake and how well will they do it. Maybe this one will seem a masterpiece after that :)",Suspiria
42,namashi_1,Dario Argento's Colorful Frightener!,10,20 July 2018,"Writer-Director Dario Argento's 'Suspiria' is an experience in pure fear & colorful bedazzlement. 'Suspiria' is widely known to be as Argento's Masterpiece, that has gripped its viewers ever since its release 41 years ago, way back in 1977. And to no surprise, this supernatural horror film is a work of a true visionary. I was, in equal measure, compelled & horrified.'Suspiria' Synopsis: An American newcomer to a prestigious German ballet academy comes to realize that the school is a front for something sinister amid a series of grisly murders.What makes 'Suspiria' one of the greatest horror films of all-time, is how it creates fear in its colors. The German ballet academy here is painted red for the most of it, with some other colors such as blue & black having their shine. And Argento uses the colors as a metaphor for this mostly disturbing tale, that is rich in violence & grisly gore. The violence depicted in 'Suspiria' is brutal & the nerve-wracking murders will leave you a little distressed.Keeping in mind that even the great tales of horror demand relief, Argento provides nicely in the narrative. And he intelligently gives this tale a twist in its characters, with particular standouts in the form of Daniel, a blind piano teacher played delightfully well by Flavio Bucci & a help in the academy, who is given spooky make-up (intentionally) & a peculiar voice, to give this horror tale a campy feel for relief. These two characters are Argento's vision of making us realize that even the tales of haunting eccentricity, demand a sense of relief & abstractness.The Performances in 'Suspiria' are decidedly over-the-top. Argento opts for deliciously hammy portrayals from his actors, shooting them in dread, with close-ups, extreme zoom-ins & zoom-outs & in pure blood. Jessica Harper is perfectly cast as the protagonist out to know the ghastly truth within the ballet academy, delivering a worthy turn, that comes across as a strong feminist part. Stefania Casini is also credible in her part. The Late/Great Joan Bennett & The Late/Great Alida Valli command the screen & adapt to Argento's bizarre vision of horror to perfection. The remaining cast are in sync with the film's mood & sportingly add to the required campiness.Luciano Tovoli's Cinematography is another masterstroke for Argento's vision. The lensman opts for wide frames, offering vastness & grandeur, while also creating fear & dread with, as mentioned earlier, extreme close-ups & some zoom-ins & zoom-outs. Tovoli's work also captures the colors on display to astonishing results. The Late/Great Franco Fraticelli's Editing is razor-crisp & doesn't keep it down on the violent bits. The violence here hits you & the Editor knows exactly how to cut & shape them for frightening effect. The Art & Costume Design are a work of mastery, while the Make-Up is easily of textbook material for b-horror movie makers & buffs.Goblin's Score is magnificent. The haunting tunes are as much a character here, giving the film the eerie feel, it strongly demands. The Score is a mix of dread & punk, that turns into a chartbuster of sorts. I have a feeling that its main theme plays every Halloween at the gothic parties? But the real star is Argento, from start to end. The Cult Filmmaker's relentless approach to execute a spooky tale on sadistic witches, is truly a work of vision & guts. He paints the film with colors (red in particular) & throws its characters in a land of unpredictable brutality & frightfulness. The results are gratifying.On the whole, 'Suspiria' is as fascinating as its frightening. This Cult-Classic has earned its status on the strength of its storytelling, style & colors.P.S. I can't wait to see how Director Luca Guadagnino will tell Argento's story with his own distinctive vision later this year. After all, the influence has been unparalleled over the years.",Suspiria
43,StevePulaski,A Vibrant Distubia,8,20 August 2010,"Suspiria is not only a movie with a great opening and closing, its a movie with some of the brightest colors ever in a Horror movie. Not on Blu-Ray, but on a DVD from Anchor Bay, it has very vibrant textures and a beautiful scenery to go along. I've never seen blood itself be so red in a movie. The opening to this movie is the highest point. Its very brutal and an intro to a highly appealing Horror flick. Being an Italian movie, and having minimal knowledge of those movies, I had no idea what I was in for. An all out mess of blood and guts? Some of the creepiest and strangest deaths to my knowledge? Or a tamer film since it was made in '77? Heres what I got.Having only seen one Dario Argento's newer films a while back called Mother of Tears I wasn't sure if he had changed his styles from 1977 to 2008. It seems like he has a bit, but still kept the 70s and 80s blood flowing. While Suspiria is a little off balance for me as far as Horror goes, its interesting flow and unique blend of Drama and Horror is interesting, while being redundant at points. I consider it creepy, at times, but at points the dialog gets tiresome and almost dragging on. I realize in 1977 everything couldn't be just killing, stabbing, slashing, murdering, burying, action all around. But sometimes the dialog scenes last so long and it goes sometimes twenty minutes without a scare, I forget Im watching a Horror film. The dialog is a bit too much here, but still effective.Suzy Bannion (Jennifer Harper) is a naive girl who is now in Munich to attend a once in a lifetime opportunity at a dance academy in the town of Freiburg. Suzy is greeted the next morning after her arrival by (Joan Bennett, in her last film role) and Miss Tanner (Alida Valli). Upon seeing a girl named Pat the night before, Suzy is told something by her she is unable to remember the next day. Suzy continues to meet and greet other members of the dance, but when she sees weird, beyond abnormal events occurring in the academy. She believes that witches may inhabit the place and she may not be so much in control.The plot is pretty simplistic, but Argento bends it enough to throw some nice twists in there. Dario Argento is not a horrible director, just not my favorite. Don't get me wrong, his work here is a million times better than the remakes nowadays, but he is just not my favorite director. Different strokes for different folks applies here and I know people treat Argento with respect, which should be the case since he is one of the few classic and very well done Horror directors left. But I think since so much garbage has came out over the years Argento has been a bit overpraised, not saying he's bad, just overpraised.While Suspiria does deliver some very vile scenes for being done in 1977, it does deliver a little too much dialog. I love dialog, Im all about it, but seeing it in a Horror movie, where the dialog is unappealing wears on me quickly. I like it in a lot of things, but not so much in Horror movies. The dialog is slow paced and droning in parts. Not that its bad, just grows tiring after a while. Especially after a huge opening scene and very cool effects and colors hit the screen, I expect a handful of more unique scenes.The films biggest boom, is the music. The synth music by Goblin and Argento himself is beyond words outstanding. It comes at the right times and leaves at the best. The synths composed for Suspiria alone are mind-blowing and excited. I've always said that music in movies usually adds to the excitement, joy, laughter, horror, suspense, etc feeling of said project. In Suspiria, its here it at full force. If remakes/movies nowadays used synths like the ones in this project, they would all earn themselves an extra star.A remake is confirmed and set for a 2012 release which is just a pathetic, bad idea. Suspiria in 2012 will not work. It may have the same plot as the 1977 version, but in no possible way will it have a better cast, idea, background, or music than the 1977 version. Suspiria doesn't need to be remade. Why remake what is already close to perfect, why change the already very well done? Aren't the purpose of remakes to make something better, if that was the case, every remake ever made in the history of movies has failed. No remake is better than the original, all are inferior. Remakes may have the same plot, not the same feel or suspense brought in the original.Suspiria is the Horror gem of the 70s and while going on to achieve a rating of cult classic will now have me as a proud watched. Much thanks to user No Personality for recommending it to me. I will watch more Argento in the future, and hopefully, the sequel Inferno will impress just as equally as this.Starring: Jessica Harper, Udo Kier, Joan Bennett, and Alida Valli. Directed by: Dario Argento.",Suspiria
44,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A one of a kind horror film, Argento was ahead of his time when he made Suspiria",9,17 November 2008,"I have heard nothing but good reviews on Suspiria, even an ex of mine to this day just praises this film. This is considered one of the scariest movies of all time, it did come out of the 70's, not to sound silly, just the best horror movies came out of the 1970's, I think the reason why is because the directors had no boundaries, they pushed things to the edge. Suspiria is also praised as Dario Argento's best work, so I finally had the opportunity to see it this morning, I took it. Now, I do think that some of the praises I've read on the IMDb page are a little far fetched, it's more about the gore that shocked people; but I do believe this is a great horror film, the best horror film about witches. The way Suspiria was made is very unique and really stands out with the other horror films of the 70's and the story is a classic haunting tale with Argento's sick twist on it.A young American dancer travels to Europe to join a famous ballet school. As she arrives, the camera turns to another young woman, who appears to be fleeing from the school. She returns to her apartment where she is gruesomely murdered by a hideous creature. Meanwhile, the young American is trying to settle in at the ballet school, but hears strange noises and is troubled by bizarre occurrences. She eventually discovers that the school is merely a front for a much more sinister organization.Suspiria is a great film, I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to see it, I would recommend this to any lover of the horror genre. But I feel that the people who have rated it low haven't given it a fair chance, like the other horror films, they expect something more like the Saw or Hostel films, today's horror genre isn't exactly great, we have had a few gems here and there, but nothing has stood out like the classics. Suspiria's ending scared the heck out of me, Argento had no boundaries, no rules, this is the first big gore film. As cheesy as the blood looks, this film has a certain feel and is a great ghost story. I'm glad I had to the opportunity to watch Suspiria, it's a terrific film, take from it what you bring to it, that's what film loving is all about.9/10",Suspiria

46,Red-Barracuda,Unforgettable candy coloured nightmare,10,21 January 2013,"Suspiria is the first film in Dario Argento's Three Mothers trilogy. It was followed up by the uneven but excellent Inferno and completed with the pretty bad Mother of Tears. Suspiria, however, is the classic. With this movie Argento moved away from his giallo roots into pure horror. Having said that this is a supernatural horror film with gialloesque elements. For one thing, the murders are committed with the assailants off-screen keeping their identity a secret in the manner of the giallo. Secondly, the protagonist recalls a half-remembered, vital clue at the climax of the movie that proves crucial in uncovering the mystery. This was a device that Argento used in several of his other gialli before and after Suspiria. But in stylistic terms, this film was a considerable leap forward. The look is resolutely unrealistic. Argento's use of coloured lighting is the most obvious factor that makes the world of Suspiria so strange and artificial. He clearly took his cue from the 60's movies of Mario Bava which were also colourful in a similarly impressive way. The intense colours contribute to the idea of Suspiria resembling some kind of a nightmare. It all looks extremely impressive throughout thanks in large part to the beautiful cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.Suspiria is a fairy-tale for adults. When originally conceived the schoolgirls were much younger teens. Unsurprisingly given the violent content it was decided that this would just be too problematic and the age of the girls was increased. However, you will notice that they often act in child-like ways as if they are still playing the parts of younger girls. Not only this but Argento added details like handles on doors positioned higher than normal meaning the girls seem smaller when reaching up to use them. In general, the gaudy décor and the Tans Academy building itself are menacing. The building and décor create an uneasy feeling all by themselves. The atmosphere throughout the movie is perhaps the greatest thing about it. Right from the wondrous opening this is a film full of menace and a feeling of that something just isn't right. We follow the lead character Suzy Banyon from arrival in Freiberg airport via a taxi journey to the Tans Academy dance school in the middle of a rain storm. In this brilliant opening it becomes clear that one of the things that marks out the genius of Argento is in the way he can make the most ordinary everyday objects seem completely threatening. Automatic doors and night fountains suddenly become strangely sinister in the world he creates.It would be impossible, however, to discuss the merits of Suspiria without making reference to its soundtrack. Italian prog-rock group Goblin had already worked with Argento before, providing an excellent score to Deep Red. But here with Suspiria they really do excel themselves. It's like no other soundtrack recorded before or since. It's made up of a cacophony of disparate ideas - sighs, a sickly lullaby, hard rock, avant-garde experimentalism and thundering drums. Altogether, it's multi-layered and completely original. It works too. The music is genuinely unsettling and creepy and aligned with Argento's incredible visuals it packs a considerable punch. Suspiria is an assault to the senses aurally as well as visually.In addition, Suspiria benefits from a great cast. Jessica Harper is excellent in the lead role. She is a very compelling presence and her subdued performance is a perfect counterpoint to the extreme events that she encounters. There are two very impressive performers in Alida Valli and Joan Bennett who both add considerable gravitas to the cast. Stefania Cassini and Udo Kier are both performers I like but unfortunately here they both are dubbed by lacking voice artists. A shame considering both actors have great, expressive voices themselves.This is a horror movie with considerable cinematic artistic merit. As a visual and aural feast for the senses the genre has rarely came up with anything quite like this before or since.",Suspiria
47,thesar-2,Wandering Witch's Ways,4,3 November 2013,"I've heard many a talk about Suspiria and I've never seen it. Not the movie, a trailer or hell, a clip of it previously. And I've known about this movie for many decades; I've even listened to the main theme many times from a horror-movie-score-collaboration CD I've owned.I love these experiences. Going into a movie, especially a well-known, cult film, cold. (Well, that's not 100% true in this case – the score does mention the word ""witch,"" so beyond knowing it's famous and it's horror, I knew it had something to do with witches.)The result of me seeing this may not be the same as most people. I cannot comment on the DVD or BluRay version of this since I have not seen either. I wanted to see this one night for my October Horror Movie Marathon of movies I've never seen before and the best I could come up with was a YouTube version. So, maybe the incredibly BAD dubbed and TERRIBLE dialogue was part of that version. I dunno. What I do know is: I gave the movie the benefit of the doubt (for the dialogue) since I watched this from YouTube.Beyond that and my free-pass, I observed the movie fully. It wasn't the most original movie, even for 1977 and the acting was subpar. But, I felt a lot of it was well shot and interesting despite the incredibly bad decisions our ""heroine"" makes throughout.Basically, the story goes: a newcomer to the ballet world ventures to Europe and inadvertently gets involved in a cult academy. Weird scene after the next evolves until the final confrontation.Following this, and a day later, I would watch another one of Director Dario Argento's films to understand how weird this guy is. That movie, Phenomena (aka Creepers,) helped me see what his visions were and they don't mesh with my ideal horror film. So, there may be more out there that like his odd sense of filmmaking, but it's not my cup of European Tea.Unfocused and random this movie may be, it's ten times better than Phenomena (aka Creepers,) but it doesn't match the better horror movies locally made. Skip it.* * * Final thoughts: The overall score was meh, but the main theme – the same one I heard on that compilation CD was fantastic. I just wish the movie mimicked the theme.",Suspiria
48,StrictlyConfidential,B-O-R-I-N-G,1,27 August 2018,"It was plainly clear to me that when Dario Argento directed this absurd, confused and badly-paced horror film back in 1977 he certainly didn't hold the intelligence level of his audience in very high regard.And, with that in mind - If Suspiria was really supposed to be Argento's absolute best offering, ever, then I totally cringe and shudder at the thought of what would be judged to be his worst.From my perspective, there's just so much about the predictable stupidity of Suspiria's less-than-frightening story to complain about that I don't know exactly where to start off.But, you can bet that there's one thing for sure - This picture took the likes of Witchcraft/Horror movies to a whole new level of dumbness like you wouldn't ever believe was possible.And, finally - I think that Suspiria suffered considerably from its musical score which was written and performed by Italian, pop wimps ""The Goblins"". Far too often this discordant and annoyingly over-loud music gave away surprises that lay ahead in store for the viewer long before they actually took place.",Suspiria
49,bensonmum2,Argento's Masterpiece,10,8 March 2005,"From IMDb: ""A young American dancer travels to Europe to join a famous ballet school. As she arrives, the camera turns to another young woman, who appears to be fleeing from the school. She returns to her apartment where she is gruesomely murdered by a hideous creature. Meanwhile, the young American is trying to settle in at the ballet school, but hears strange noises and is troubled by bizarre occurrences. She eventually discovers that the school is merely a front for a much more sinister organization."" From the moment Suzy (Jessica Harper) steps out of the airport at the beginning of the movie, the power of Suspiria is evident. Suspiria is like a Technicolor nightmare. No matter how many times I've seen this movie, I never get tired of it. In fact, I seem to enjoy it more with each subsequent viewing. Very few films have a combination of visuals (each frame of film is like a painting), soundtrack (few films have a soundtrack that so perfectly compliments the action on screen), and story (I've always found the story to be one of the most compelling aspects) like Suspiria. In my opinion, this is very nearly the perfect movie.It is very difficult to make a horror movie that actually frightens. Suspiria has moments that are to me as frightening as any I've seen. The scene that immediately pops to mind is the bathroom scene near the beginning of the movie. The girl in the bathroom hears a noise and looks out the window to investigate. As a viewer, I just knew something was going to happen. The situation and music are a clear indication that this girl is in trouble. But Argento is very patient and allows the tension to build. When nothing immediately happens, you're sure that Argento had been playing a trick on you. All of a sudden - BAM - you see two eyes staring back into the bathroom. I jump out of my seat every time I see that scene. It's really filmed very masterfully.One complaint I've read on numerous websites concerns the acting. I tend to think a lot of people are confusing bad acting with the whole dubbing process used by Argento and other Italian directors. Suspiria was originally filmed in English with no sound actually recorded. All of the dialogue was added in post production. Why? Often, these Italian films featured actors who spoke a variety of languages - not necessarily English. During filming, these actors would do their best to phonetically sound out the dialogue. Another persons voice was then often added and matched as good as possible to the lip movements. The lip movements and dialogue are often out of sync and I think some people have a hard time getting past this.",Suspiria
50,Pjtaylor-96-138044,This goes to eleven.,7,26 October 2019,"I'd be surprised if Dario Argento has ever heard of subtlety. 'Suspiria (1977)', the colour-soaked classic, is so constantly overt and in-your-face that it's almost comical at times. When it comes to horror, usually less is more. In this piece, more is all there is. As such, it's not particularly scary. However, it's strangely entertaining. I can't quite put my finger on why, but it's undeniably effective. It's fantastically distinct and distinctly fantastic. In fact, I don't think I've seen anything quite like it before. Its narrative is somewhat simple and, even, messy; once it's over, you realise there isn't all that much to it. Still, the visuals and, to an extent, soundtrack make its events seem much more impactful than they actually are. It's neon-soaked, bathed in solid washes of bright colour, and relentless, relying on abrasive and other-worldly music - which may or may not be at least partially diegetic - to convey its supernatural scares. It never lets up, maintaining a level of intensity most movies seldom see for a single scene. Even though the score is almost annoying at times, it creates a unique and nearly oppressive atmosphere. Sometimes, it makes the slightly schlocky acting and rather silly horror sequences seem humorous. Of course, its famously graphic violence is as shocking as you'd expect, infrequently smashing through the established aesthetic to brutally vicious effect. The flick hasn't aged quite as well as you'd hope, in terms of its frights, but it remains an almost must-see experience; after all, it must be seen to be believed. It's not incredible, but it's good enough and it absolutely nails the heightened feel it's going for. I like it more in retrospect but I'm unable to pinpoint the exact reason. It has an intangible allure. Most films never reach an intensity level of ten out of ten. This goes to eleven. 7/10.",Suspiria
51,bowmanblue,They don't make 'em like they used to...,7,17 April 2015,"...and some people may say 'Thank goodness for that.' Some people might, but not me. Suspiria has a lot going for it. It also has a lot of negatives about it. In fact, it may even be one of those rarest of films which actually might benefit from a modern day remake.It's about a young American girl who enrols in a ballet school in Europe. Unfortunately, the school is run by witches (and not even the nice Nicole Kidman types from Bewitched).The good: the film is spectacular to watch, simply because of the use of rich and vibrant colours in every scene. If ever a movie had 'a look' then this is it.The bad: the acting. It's dubbed. And when was the last time you watched a film with Oscar-winning performances that had been dubbed? The acting is pretty bad.The indifferent: the musical score. If you like electro (and possibly have seen Dawn of the Dead 1979) you may be familiar with the band The Goblins. Well, they outdo their previous work with a truly loud score. It's supposed to make you jump and create tension. Personally, I liked it, but I've read plenty of negative comments saying how it was too loud, distracting and even made people have to turn the volume up and down all the way through the film.There is gore - low budget stuff though and if you like your horror slow burning and colourful, you might get something out of this.",Suspiria
52,dromasca,trash and/or masterpiece?,6,4 April 2020,"'Suspiria' and a few other of Dario Argento's films that became the classics of today have represented a turn towards extreme of the horror genre. By pushing the level of bloody violence and sexuality, either implicit or explicit, the Italian director has teared up all the ratings lists and the code books of the big studios. 'Suspi is today considered a cult film and a reference film. I saw it over four decades after the production and I came to the conclusion that this film is a combination of extremes. From many points of view it is trash, from others an excellent artistic achievement, almost a masterpiece, dare I say.The story takes its inspiration from the gloomy European romanticism and perhaps even from its older sources such as fairy tales from the 17th and 18th centuries, which are at the origin of many 'horror' films, especially those belonging to German expressionism. There are a few conventional patterns that are followed in this film too: the young traveler who discovers a foreign space dominated by mysterious evil forces, the huge houses or manors with hidden cottages haunted by the ghosts of the past, the legends about witches and their influence over the ages. Jessica Harper, the actress cast in the role of the young American dancer who travels to Germany to discover that the famous dance school she attends hides many bloody mysteries, is chosen to look like a teenager, a few years younger than her colleagues, a Snow White in a dangerous and crushing world. When the bodies begin to accumulate, the script chooses to deal with the psychology of the girl and her confrontation with the mysteries around and less or not at all with the police investigation or any other attempt to explain what is happening using the logic of our world. Even the intervention of psychologists adds elements to the fantastic and not the rational dimension. Psychology associated with witchcraft, or maybe even a modern form of witchcraft? Not a bad idea!The story itself, however, may be less important in 'Suspiria' than the context. Dialogues sound mostly ridiculous, and the acting fails (or may not intend) to inject in them any truth. However, I noticed the presence of Alida Valli, one of the great stars of Italian cinema from the 1940s and 1950s. What is more impressive than the story is the way it is told. The sets make up a fantastic and oversized world, dominated by yellow, orange and red - the color of red wine recommended as a tonic, in fact a metaphor for the blood that often springs up in many of the violent episodes with which the film is sprinkled. From here comes the inspiration for the fantastic sets of the later films of David Lynch or Wes Anderson. In most of Dario Argento's films his obsession with death and sex is present, here the balance is decisively on the side of death, the feminine attraction being repressed and sublimated within the age and fragility of the heroines. From a visual point of view, the film is a feast. The cinematography uses and combines masterfully the capabilities of film processing that preceded by decades the computer effects. The soundtrack adds to the visual experience, being a mixture of free jazz, electronic music and characteristic sound effects. The film is a landmark in the history of the horror genre, a mix of trash without excuses with literary inspirations, apparent amateurism and cinematic mastery. All the reasons that made 'Suspiria' a cult film are valid.",Suspiria
53,gbill-74877,Fantastic and beautiful,9,13 October 2019,"While watching Suspiria it didn't take long for me to think, my god, this is such a pretty film. The color palette has those saturated primary colors that stand out, but also includes such a wide spectrum of other hues and tones, e.g. teal, lilac, and gold. The framing, lighting, camera angles, and use of reflections are all very artistic, and I loved the various details in the set design, e.g. those swirls on the staircase and so many other things. For a film that is so unsettling, with that wonderfully jarring soundtrack and the tension in the story, it's amazing that there is such harmony in its visual images. And for a horror film, I have to say, I appreciated the restraint in the gore that's shown - it's not zero, but it's not overkill either. There are also two or three moments that came as nice surprises in what you might think would be a predictable story. It feels like a B movie in its plot, acting, and that cheesy dubbing, but the production value overall is outstanding because of the aesthetic that director Dario Argento brought to the film. I really enjoyed this one, and wish other films in the horror genre had such artistry.",Suspiria

56,Bored_Dragon,Art-horor,8,22 May 2019,"""Suspiria"" by Dario Argento, from 1977, was a completely new experience for me. I watched some horror movies that pretend to be art-films before, but those which I had the misfortune to encounter, with artistic approach only canceled potential for horror effect, if they had it at all, so that the result is a film that is neither artistically fascinating nor scary. As opposed to them, Argento managed to make a film that features excellent camera and directing, effective use of colors, in which each frame is an art photography, and which, at the same time, with great contribution of excellent sound effects and perfectly appropriate music, builds an eerie atmosphere, successfully maintains tension and, at times, it is really bloodcurdling. For the full experience, I suggest you watch it in complete darkness and with good surround sound system or headphones. The acting is also good and, in my opinion, the only flaw of the film is the story itself, which is not bad, but it is not even close to the level of all the other aspects of the movie.Cinematography: 10/10

57,clanciai,Life is not just a dance on roses at the ballet academy of witches.,8,23 July 2017,"What makes this weird horror film of a ballet academy with murders going on non stop is the extremely artistic composition of the images using colour like an expressionist painter to make more a work of art than a regular film. The story is absurd: the ballet academy is run by two lady dinosaurs (Alida Valli and Joan Bennett) like two awesome commissars driving hard the dancing students evidently to their violent deaths, while the leading girl (Jessica Harper) gets increasingly worried as her friends disappear. Of course, the ballet academy seems to be run by witchcraft somehow, and some psychiatrists get involved. Then there is bad weather occasionally with lots of thunder and lightnings, there are problems with the telephone, she gets nightmares, and so on.There is no credibility at all to anything in this film, and yet it is fascinating and well made and worth the terrible experience if for nothing else at least for its sustained impressing colour expressionism.",Suspiria
58,sol-,My brief review of the film,7,9 July 2005,"A well-directed horror film in which Dario Argento shows a talent for style, colour and atmosphere, the technical side of the movie provides some compensation for a silly plot and bland characters. Argento's lighting choices are wonderful, especially the red and blue filters, which induce an ominous feeling when contrasted against each other. The creative camera angels keep the film interesting on a visual level, and the music, though a bit monotonous, perfectly suits the project. This is not a particularly well acted, nor a particularly well-written horror film - but as a rather entertaining entry in the genre the film succeeds, due the workings of a director who knows how to make a film intriguing.",Suspiria
59,poe426,Third time was the charm...,10,11 October 2014,"The first time I saw SUSPIRIA, at a walk-in theater, there weren't very many people in the audience; this went a long way toward making the movie seem even more creepy than it actually was (as did the fact that I was just a kid). The second time around, it was playing on a double bill at the drive-in and I was so engrossed in the VERY creepy scene where the blind piano player is ripped apart by his own seeing-eye dog that, when my mother stepped up to my window in the dark, I showered myself with popcorn and soda pop. Ah, the memories... Just the other day, I rented the movie again and sat down to watch it for the first time in decades. It did NOT disappoint. (Nor did it EVER disappoint me: I even wrote a letter to FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND in which I praised the film.) The first thing I noticed this last time around was that the veined, pulsing title (courtesy of the Chiodo brothers) of the earlier two versions was gone. But not to worry: the memorable Goblin soundtrack is still intact, as are the eerie noises, screams and whispers that tend to raise the hair on the back of the neck. From the beautifully atmospheric opening sequence to the ""Fall of the House of Escher"" ending, SUSPIRIA is must-see filmmaking. It's Bava-esque in its look and feel and it COULD be argued that Style trumps Substance (it's ultimately a rather simple story that's nonetheless beautifully visualized, a la Nicholas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW), but so what? Movies are primarily a VISUAL medium, anyway- and, visually, SUSPIRIA is still stunning (even more so now than when I saw it as a kid, because now I can better appreciate what went into the film). Like other supernatural classics like BURN, WITCH, BURN! and even George Romero's SEASON OF THE WITCH (the latter a slow-moving but well-acted version of BURN, WITCH, BURN!, if you ask me), SUSPIRIA works as a fairy tale well-told. (On one episode of THE CINEFILES on YouTube, host Edwin Samuelson tries in vain to defend Argento as a filmmaker against two of his co-hosts. Rest assured, Mr. Samuelson: you are not alone in your appreciation of Dario Argento.)",Suspiria
60,johnnyboyz,Tense and rattling depiction of sordid goings-on at a far reaching locale of high culture; a chilling submersion into a terrifying world which works really well.,7,31 January 2011,"Dario Argento's Suspiria is about a young woman so far out of her depth, that dealing with being able to integrate into an offshore culture and come to bond with those to which you're alien is the least of the her problems. The film takes clear glee in tossing a young American girl head first into a fierce cauldron within a foreign place further still within a foreign nation, plunging her into the pouring rain that greets her as she makes her way beyond the international boundaries marked by way of an airport's exit and then into what will come to form a bleak proverbial mire. The howling wind and driving rain makes it tough to keep dry and retain a normalised, balanced look; she drags her luggage through the conditions made tougher with little in the way of other people around to help; then, upon tyring to obtain access to a taxi, she is shunned by the mechanical-like driving past of various cabs until, finally, one stops to pick her up. Salvation? Not really - even communication with the driver is difficult through the language barrier.Once at her destination, you'd think the worst of it was over; the trekking out from where she's from and limping through the initially difficult stages of getting there only to, at last, get to where it is she's going. Not so, as further confusion over the intercom at the entrance to the locale follows, before a girl not that much older flees from the door in an hysterical and garbled mess. Away from what the lead female is able to witness, but perversely informing a continuously watching audience thus informing us and not her that something is definitely wrong with this place, someone or something catches up with the escapee, and she is dispatched in a less than pretty display. There begins 1977 film Suspiria, and the two key items that will come to act as foundations for the film; namely, that notion of a young woman being in a foreign locale in which she will struggle or suffer hardships, along with the catalyst in the form of overlying terror and unnerving ambiguity, particularly in regards to the mystery as to what's actually unravelling behind the scenes in this place.The film is one of such which revolves around a girl in a location she has every right to be wary of and initially struggle through before getting a grip on the situation and rising to what it offers. Jessica Harper plays the lead, a young and fragile looking American named Suzy Bannion. She's a dancer, one of whom has showed such promise in recent times back home that enrolling at a prestigious school in West Germany beckons; that notion of, not West Germany, but Europe in general being a locale of both culture and academia rearing its head once again – when intelligent American characters need to journey somewhere so as to study something at a higher level, Europe always seems to be the place they either travel to or strive to travel to.After night-set shooting and blood red hues dominating the frame during Suzy's arrival and the young girl's death, we are greeted by fresher, bluer and more welcoming tones the following morning. All appears well at the dance school, the employees are welcoming and quick to dismiss any of the foulness raised from the previous night. The other girls appear in relatively stark contrast to Suzy, her one confidant in Sara (Casini) already at a stage in her own paranoia which will see things on that particular strand effectively unravel later on. The school comes across as somewhat of a female dominated zone, one female student encapsulating the feminine empowerment at the place in her strutting around a dormitory room whilst bare legged and whilst in a loose white gown of some description, wielding cigarette holders in a sultry and fetishistic manner. The male students few-and-far between amidst all the female ones, and the school is a place in which most of the men appear to do either the menial work or exist to purely serve the woman in some form. One of these men arrives in the form of an apparently mute Romanian butler, a male charged with moving items to and from locations therein in an unfussy and subdued manner, while a blind pianist must play what he is told to until he himself can take it no longer and is then punished for his disobedient transgressions.Suzy's eventual clashing with the school in this and mostly every regard is seemingly obligatory, Argento's film a very gradual; bleak, brooding and ruthlessly effective little number covering substantial ground in both the thriller, horror and mystery genres. The entire film arrives with a pumping and pulsating musical score upon which first heard appears to be a chorus of Islamic prayers acting as a coating to some high pitched breathing and gasping, all the while accompanied by blaring bursts of throbbing acoustic guitar combining wonderfully and acting as a fantastic over-tune to proceedings. The film builds to a quite chilling culmination, the notion of building and brooding your way to something and providing us with an attentive enough attitude towards character evident and working with the film as it concludes with a large payoff; there is nary a sign of dunderheaded schlock frills for eighty minutes before the cheap wrapping of everything off. Suspiria is good fun, a playful and well made little film delivering on a number of levels as it covers its lead's descent into the uncanny unknown.",Suspiria

Still, after all those gone by years good and a pleasure for the eye and soul to watch - I'm really curious if the upcoming remake can keep up with this one.Verdict: a pleasure to watch, maybe not for the mainstream horror crowd, but for the lover of the extraordinaire.

62,insomniac_rod,Beautiful in visuals and creepy in depth content. In diabolical deluxe color where available!,9,3 January 2007,"This is probably Dario Argento's finest movie to date. It's more than just a Horror movie; it's a terrifying visual experience covered with tension, a creepy atmosphere, beautiful gore, and a chilling score.""Suspiria"" is the perfect mix of elements in order to create a memorable Horror movie. The atmosphere is unsettling and always creepy. There's a feeling of uncertainty and fear throughout the movie that truly makes you feel part of the experience. Many reviewers have mentioned the relevance of the colorful art direction of the movie. I just want to mention that the fore-mentioned art techniques are visually stunning and give a special vibe for the movie. The colors play important roles for the most important events, and helps the viewer understand some situations. I agree that this is among the most beautiful Horror movies ever made; talking about visuals. The perfect combination between colors and dark is brilliant.There's also room for beautiful gore. The first murder sequence is amazing because it's creative, surreal, and very violent. You don't expect a maniac to crash the window and slaughter poor Pat. The reset of the movie has minimal but great gore. The death scenes are overall impressive and are featured through spectacular camera angles. For example, Daniel's death scene is memorable because before the gore happens, visuals take an important role in the scene when the devil's statue makes an appearance and then suddenly disappears before the dog attack. It's a chilling and scary scene. Also, the chilling ending deserves some special recognition for it's rich directing techniques, the great use of colors, and mainly because the high fear factor. The threatening dialogs of the Black Queen, the dead girl who comes to life (who in my opinion inspired the possessed woman from ""Evil Dead II""), the witch's silhouette, the great gore, the make-up... My respects. It's truly one of the most creepy endings in Horror movies history. Argento knows perfectly how to display terror. So there you go, you have a visually stunning Horror movie. It's a visual experience in terror like none other. Believe the hype. The score also plays an important factor in the movie. The chilling music (probably inspired by ""The Exorcist"") and the background taunting from the witch is simply memorable. My only problem with ""Suspiria"" are the over the top characters in some scenes that only demonstrate that Argento has preferences over theater acting. For example, the scene where Olga and Sara insult each other looked truly cheesy and didn't go with the movie's atmosphere. Also, Pat's cheap acting in the opening sequence, as another example. I am aware of the script changes that weren't made in order to make the girls look older but still. Also, Daniel's acting was over the top when it wasn't necessary. For some moments it looked like Argento's movie was taking a cheesy direction. I'm glad it didn't. Also, some scenes feature stupid actions from the lead characters. Sometimes Argento does not pay close attention to behavior reality and he isn't able to give it to his characters. But that's just my point of view. Jessica Harper delivers a great performance filled with dramatism and fear. She's great in her role and a delight to watch. The cast is overall very good with veteran actors and actresses and some amateurs. The plot is very simple and easy to follow and that's what makes you care about the main character. Argento is a specialist in displaying hints that lead to important events in his movies. I mean, some scenes seem to be insignificant for the plot but suddenly take special relevance for important scenes in order to take the story to a new level. Also, some minimal details shown in the movie should be taken in consideration because most of them may have relevance to the plot. The plot is very simple and easy to follow but the sub-plots, hints, and bits of strangeness makes it delightfully complicated in a positive way. The story goes likes this : a beautiful ballet dancer from USA named Suzy moves to a prestigious and snobby academy in Germany in order to complete a three years course. From the very beginning she experiences strange situations involving the mature women who run the academy; that includes the sub-director, and the house-mistress. As time passed and getting the aid from a psychologist and expert in witches, she finds out that the Academy is a witch coven lead by the Black Queen.

This is one of the most highly praised (if not THE most highly praised) European horror movie of all time. Whenever anyone asks, ""What horror movies are good? What should I see?"" this movie is invariably in the elitist list. Its use of light and color is, indeed, a true study of cinematic technique and style. So what?! The one good idea Argento had (the imagery) was simply not enough to cover for the total lack of script, acting talent, meaningful dialog, horrible direction of these ""actresses,"" and the downright cheese-filled all-out crapfest that is Suspira.SPOILERS ABOUNDIn the first death scene, the acting was the most puerile trash I've ever witnessed (and I've SEEN Killer Klowns from Outer Space). These girls did not die well, prettily, or with grace. In fact, they didn't die with talent, either. The ""death scenes"" were nothing but an indication to me that this should have been the death of the movie. There simply aren't words for how horribly these girls portrayed their parts. Honestly, if the red-head had actually fallen that far with a cord attached around her neck, the weight of her body would have popped her head off her neck, rather than the sloppy inane banality we were given.Inane banality actually sums up the entirety of this movie.

This was actually much, MUCH worse than ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,""which was a total waste of my time. A friend, who watched this garbage with me observed, ""You know, Fiend? Aside from no one being naked, this really reminds me of a porno."" Okay, hence the exploitation feel of this film. I don't care. How could I possibly care? The ""atmosphere"" everyone raves about just came off as a really bad porn and nothing more. Nothing could have saved this film from Argento's lack of talent but a really good remake. Hopefully, they won't make the mistake of assuming that this was, in any way, to be considered ""artsy."" The acting quality is nonexistent and the screen play should have been exorcised and then buried in about 7 tons of salt, if you ask me. Even the ""ballerinas"" were inept. I've seen better down at the local play house.Most of the players and the director being Italian is a far cry from making this ""art."" European does not equate ""art."" Sorry, but um...no. This is rubbish. Nothing but unadulterated crap. The ""effects"" are laughable and there was not one redeeming performance in this whole venture. All I've accomplished in watching this garbage is the wasting of 95-98 minutes. I should've taken a nap, instead. The time would have been put to much better use.The musical score sounded like something that a two-year-old crackhead relentlessly banged out on the kitchen pots and pans in an epileptic seizure to rival the mother of all epileptic fits. The sound effects were distracting rather than complementary; cutting in and out at the worst possible moments, and coming off like some irritating noise an eight year old was making in the back seat of the car to annoy his dork brother. Refuse to be one of those mindless sheep who follow the herd. Don't allow yourself to be dragged into the whole mindset that because it's Argento, it's genius. That's just NOT the case, as Suspira MORE than proves. This is the most dismally wretched act of cinematic micturition ever to be committed to film, and I've seen some real stinkers in my time. If you waste your time on seeing this so-called ""movie"" after reading this, you've no one to blame but yourself. It scarcely rates a 1.2/10 on the ""B"" scale. That does not register anywhere on the ""A"" scale, I assure you.the Fiend :.",Suspiria
68,Captain_Couth,"A wild, loud and colorful horror film from Dario Argento.",10,12 November 2003,"Suspiria (1977) is an assault on one's senses. A true horror classic. From the vivid red and blues, the horrific set pieces and the loud rock music from Goblin. Argento wanted a film that could shock people then, now and into the future. In my opinion, Suspiria has accomplished that. It's a film that people will still be talking about for years to come. The music from Goblin is awesome and it's the perfect companion piece to this movie.The script (written mostly by Daria Nicolodi) tells the story of three evil witches. One happens to reside in Germany (The Tanz Academy), the others in Italy and America. Suzy Bannon (Jessica Harper) attends the dance school and eventually stumbles across it's dark secret.Suspiria has been recently restored to it's original Technicolor glory. The reds and blues are strong, the print is pristine and the soundtrack is loud. This movie happens to be one of my personnel favorites and it still scares me! Highly recommended! It's one of the essentials.",Suspiria
69,Bezenby,Dario's best? I can't decide,9,27 October 2016,"This is one of those almost flawless (but quirky) Italian horror films that make me such a drooling, fawning fan to the point where I've actually gone to Rome and visited Argento's museum of horror. Who wants to touch me? I SAID WHO WANTS TO TOUCH ME? This one is set in a residential ballet school which may be run by witches, one of whom might be one of the 'three motherfeckers' (see Inferno and Motherfecker of Tears for the sequels.)Don't worry too much about the plot though. Like a lot of Italian films, the plot is the usual, but the director's stamp is unique. Here Dario goes for an ever developing colour scheme and a sonic assault on the old ears. A work mate of mine told me he went to see this back in the seventies in quadraphonic sound and it blew his mind. I can understand.Loads of creepy scenes, lots of creepy imagery, some maggots, and a bucket of gore make this one of Argento's strongest films (I can't decide if I like this, Tenebrae, or Deep Red the best, I can watch all three without ever getting sick of them). For anyone interested in dipping their toes into Italian film, this is a good starting point. Although please note I did just that with someone and they switched it off after five minutes.",Suspiria
70,Polaris_DiB,Classical conditioning,9,29 October 2007,"From the get-go, Suspiria is filled with bright imagery and sound. Right before a very early moment of killing, it seems like Argento is purposefully overdoing it with the music and the sound. The Goblins' playing is relentless and it seems absurd that it's supposed to lead to anything scary... and then the killing happens. From then on, the music no longer seems extraneous, but only deeply foreboding.Dario Argento's Suspiria is not a horror movie of plot or suspense, but of experience. If Hitchcock depended on Freud, Argento depends on Pavlov, and it's as if this movie is an attempt to classically condition the audience against it's own logic. Visuals and sound unravel at overt levels to set your mind towards terror. Surprisingly, it works despite my better judgment.A young American woman attends an academy for ballet in Germany. She hardly even has time to settle in before crazy things start happening: a woman runs out of the school as she's trying to enter, subsequently getting murdered; another young woman taken to the new arrival starts whispering about witches and mysteries; an uncannily scary looking woman and boy reflect light into the American's face, sapping all her energy. The colors are very Hitchcockian and Argento's camera delights in floating around in long takes; his use of dubbing for sound does not create problems as expected but lends a particularly surreal air; he plays with different effects from straight-up gross-out (maggots) to psychological terror (the hallways) to a scene that single-handedly makes the entire Saw series redundant (the wires in the closet). Best of all, he sets it on a place called Ascher Street, in Gothic buildings decorated with Escher interiors.It's hard to exclaim the point as to why this movie is so successful: Argento is utterly expressionistic, willing to eschew logic or reality for a good ol' brain-tingling mesh of effects that somehow add up to a very pleasing and loaded aural and visual experience.--PolarisDiB",Suspiria

My first viewing of Suspiria was an uncut, poor quality VHS bootleg. Then it had a British BBFC18 release but with cuts. Move on a decade and I got it on DVD. Now I have just watched the magnificent 4K blu ray restoration and it just blew me away! Suspiria is not going to appeal to everybody, that's for sure. But for me it's the type of movie that you do not simply watch - you experience it. I love everything about it: the magnificent sets, the rich, glorious colour, the pounding Goblin soundtrack, the brutality, the tension, the great camera work and the fact that it is pretty scary! Dario Argento made several Italian horror classics but Suspiria in my opinion is his finest work. Essential viewing.",Suspiria
72,strong-122-478885,Complain! Complain! Complain!,2,15 August 2013,"For starters - From where I was sitting, it was plainly clear to see that when Dario Argento directed this absurd, confused and badly-paced horror film back in 1977 he certainly didn't hold the intelligence of his audience in very high regard.And, with that firmly in mind - If Suspiria really is supposed to be Argento's absolute best offering, ever, then I totally cringe and shudder at the thought of what would be judged to be his worst. Yeah. His worst must be so wretched that it beats out all of the most incompetent, dismal and unscary horror flicks ever gathered together into one lump sum.From my perspective - There was just so much predictability and stupidity about Suspiria's less-than-frightening story that I don't exactly know where start off with my complaints.But, you can bet that there's one thing for sure - This utterly shallow picture took the likes of Witchcraft/Horror movies to a whole new level of dumbness like you wouldn't ever believe possible.For one thing - Suspiria (which certainly took itself and its artsy/fartsy-ness way too seriously) contained, in its uncensored state, no gratuitous sex or nudity, whatsoever. And, as far as I'm concerned, this was definitely the sort of film that literally cried out for this type of distraction in order to compensate for all of the nonsensical heavy-handedness that prevailed throughout.To be sure - Suspiria (with all of its bad acting and cardboard, cut-out characters) was a bona-fide thumb-twiddler of the highest order.I think that Argento's repeated use of the red/blue/green colored lighting schemes in countless scenes showed a director of really bad taste and a decidedly limited imagination.And, finally - I think that above all of my other complaints, Suspiria suffered considerably from its musical score which was written and performed by the Italian, pop-wimps ""The Goblins"". Far too often this discordant and annoyingly over-loud music gave away any surprises that lay in store for the viewer long before they actually took place.All-in-all - I would never, ever recommend Suspiria (with all of its super fake-looking blood) to anyone whom I personally respected. If this film is really supposed to be a ""cult classic"", then it's got to be one of the most shamefully over-rated examples of its kind that I've seen in a mighty long, long time.Yeah.So there.",Suspiria
73,ackstasis,"""Bad luck isn't brought by broken mirrors, but by broken minds""",8,27 January 2011,"Today we welcome an entirely new genre to your humble reviewer's repertoire: the Italian ""giallo."" From what I could glean, the term refers to a pulpy style of Gothic thriller, most prominent in the cinema in the 1960s and 1970s. 'Suspiria (1977)' – stylistically, half Roger Corman and half Brian De Palma – boasts a strong emphasis on dreams and paranoia, and a perverse fascination with the act of murder. One early death, a real show-stopper, is depicted in glorious operatic slow- motion, and sees a young student (Eva Axen) hanging from a glass ceiling. If I wasn't giving this film my full attention, I was now! Needless to say, the original US theatrical cut was bowdlerised quite liberally. The film's soundtrack, by a band called Goblin, is supremely unsettling, though it rises so loudly above the dialogue volume that I had to watch the film with remote control at the ready.An American girl (Jessica Harper) arrives in Germany to attend a prestigious dance academy, only to discover that the school is governed by a coven of witches. The plot may be wafer-thin, but the visuals are utterly amazing. The school hallways blaze with orange at night-time, casting ominous, exaggerated shadows across the walls. The building itself seems to pulsate with sinister intent; in fact, I was reminded of 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920),' in which otherwise solid walls distort violently to match the twisted mind of its narrator. Blood is coloured such a fierce red that it appears unreal, lending the violence a sense of theatricality, an operatic intensity that elevates it above most contemporary American horror films. It's well known that Brian De Palma was a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock, but his style appears to borrow just as freely from films like this.",Suspiria
74,dee.reid,"""Suspiria"" - What does that title mean, anyway?",10,21 March 2010,"""Suspiria"" is one of the most fascinating horror films ever made. I mean that, really. I make note of the fact that not only is ""Suspiria"" an incredibly well-made horror film (considering its budget and the reputation of slasher movies in general), but it's actually scary. All this has to do with the unconventional direction of Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, who up until watching ""Suspiria"" for the first time in its entirety a few nights ago, I only knew by reputation - not by film (though I am aware that he collaborated with George A. Romero on my favorite horror movie of all time - 1978's ""Dawn of the Dead"").His 1977 ""Suspiria"" is arguably his best and most well-known horror film. Incredibly enough, much of what makes this movie scary is not because of the usual theatrics usually associated with run-of-the-mill slasher flicks - masked and/or unseen killer, scantily-clad sexy lead heroine and other like-dressed female associates, just plain dumb characters who abide by the ""rules"" of slasher movies, buckets and buckets of gore, ominous music, etc. While ""Suspiria"" uses elements of all these (and would in turn influence subsequent horror films in the United States), they are, to be precise, merely tools at Argento's disposal - they're not the film's driving force.That is to say that ""Suspiria"" is probably the most frightening-sounding movie ever made. I'm deadly serious about that last statement. No movie has made me more at unease due to the combination of the use of its soundtrack (by the Italian band Goblin), sound effects, and general use of sound than ""Suspiria."" This is really where Argento shines as a director here - through his use of sound and music, and the mayhem that many times ensues whenever/wherever it's employed. And there is some pretty surreal and frightening imagery to boot.But too bad the film's plot doesn't match the effect of its soundtrack. To some, that's a bad thing. But in the ""giallo"" genre (the Italian word for ""yellow,"" and is also the mystery/thriller style of storytelling popular in Argento's native Italy), this IS a good thing, style and atmosphere over plot and characters. The plot is insanely simple and almost episodic in nature: the film's central character is American ballet dancer Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper), who enrolls at a prestigious European dance academy and discovers along with her roommate and fellow dancer Sara (Stephania Casina), that the place is run by a coven of witches.As stated earlier, all of this secondary to Argento's use of sound, color, imagery, and music. I've never before been so effectively creeped out by a movie's soundtrack before, nor have I ever seen such prominent use of music before to scare the hell out of the audience. Two of the film's most frightening and surreal moments involves a blind man in the darkness of a vacant square, and Sara being pursued through the dance academy's labyrinthine hallways by an unseen, knife-wielding maniac. Combined with the film's dreamy atmosphere, these two sequences come to stand out in a movie that ultimately plays out like some vivid nightmare come to horrifying life.With all this mind, it immediately separates ""Suspiria"" from the rest of the crop of horror flicks as being something truly unique to the genre. I can assure you that is not to say that all other horror films I've seen dim in comparison to this film, but I'm just commenting on how different Argento's style of direction is when compared to some of his peers. It certainly makes for quite a viewing experience.""Suspiria"" is unquestionably one of the most uniquely frightening horror films I've ever seen. Dario Argento has made a horror flick that is most certainly hard to compare to and I can say that I have found a new horror favorite. This film is also shockingly gory and violent (its outbursts of violence are so sudden and infrequent that they're actually quite horrifying), blandly acted (which is not so bad, after all), and just plain scary. This movie is not just a thriller or a slasher.This movie is ""Suspiria.""10/10",Suspiria

76,drqshadow-reviews,A Prime Example of Slash Over Substance,4,22 October 2021,"Arriving in Germany to perfect her craft, a promising young ballet dancer is thrust into a roiling pot of aggressive weirdness. She hasn't even passed through the school's front door before a would-be classmate runs screaming out into the woods, never to be seen (alive) again. As the week progresses, she'll have an episode with a mood-altering knife, comb live maggots out of her hair and encounter an invisible headmistress as the student body count climbs.Director Dario Argento doesn't shy from the uncomfortable bits: each death is proudly exhibited in a line of provocative, if sometimes random, gory indulgences. After that girl stumbles into a poorly-placed pit of razor wire, for example, he'll dive in for the close-up as she thrashes and wails. The portrayals are all representative of the era, with oodles of thick, bright red paint in lieu of a more convincing blood substitute and no shortage of dated makeup effects, so Suspira's enthusiasm to show off falls rather flat in a modern light. Its ambitious knack for set design and dynamic use of color are no less bold, but they've held up better over the years. Argento seems to relish the larger-than-life, pairing his film's surreal environs and loud lighting choices with an equally harsh, chaotic musical score. These eccentricities can be downright smothering at times, though, and the slim, slow-moving plot often suffers as a result. It's stylish enough, but wild splashes of artistry and loose morals can only carry a film so far. At some point, we're bound to want a little more meat on the bone.",Suspiria
77,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,5,16 March 2017,"Baby-faced student Suzie Bannion (Jessica Harper) travels to a German dance-school which becomes a living nightmare for her. A selection of disco-lit killings take place before a peripheral character explains the origins of the place, and why it has become such a location of terror.The unforgiving rain, faces staring, the darkness of night - all these things and more are accompanied (or drowned out) by the relentless, driving musical score. When the soundtrack is not present, it comes as a relief. So huge and all-encompassing is this crashing music that it all but smothers everything, especially the performances. And when something truly dramatic and horrific happens, the accompaniment storms back once again bringing with it an overpowering effect that works against proceedings rather than enhancing them. Equally the sets, so rich in colour and pattern clearly win the fight with the actors in arresting the attention – sometimes effectively, providing a lush, poetic, dreamlike environment, and others simply far, far too decadent not to work with the soundtrack in inducing a migraine. I can understand the intention to make everything heightened and not-quite-real, but whilst it sometimes works, often it is too loud and too much.The character who does the most to make an impression amidst all around her is Miss Tanner, formidable gravel-voiced dance-instructress. Croatian actress Alida Valli plays her with a prison-officer deportment and ensures Tanner is every bit as fearsome as her reputation within the school suggests.I've seen this described as a terrifying masterpiece of Italian cinema, but the overall effect, although commendably original, is mostly lost on me. Perhaps I prefer something slightly more subtle. That said, the last 15 minutes racks up the horror content rather and ensures that the experience at least ends on a high.",Suspiria

There are, as in most of Argento's films, a couple of clever murders but not much else. Harper, one of the quirkiest screen presence, doesn't do much aside from looking wide-eyed while headmistress Joan Bennett seems to be reading cue cards. Udo Kier is a doctor and a very odd looking Alida Valli plays a very Prussian dance instructor. It's all very colorful, but not very frightening.",Suspiria
79,Lechuguilla,Artistic Nightmare,6,30 June 2004,"A German ballet school for girls is the setting for mysterious deaths, in this 1977 horror story, written and directed by Dario Argento.  ""Suspiria"" is a visually stunning film.The images contain objects we recognize, like people, buildings, and interior decor.  But the objects seem vaguely menacing, and less real than surreal, as though they symbolize ideas, repressed desires, or subconscious fears.  The vivid, rich colors, strange camera angles, deep shadows, and bright light piercing through darkness, all contribute to the impression that the viewer is trapped in someone else's nightmare.One haunting segment of the film takes place in a huge, and strangely empty, public square, at night.  A blind man and his German shepherd dog stand in the middle of the square, surrounded by imposing buildings of neo-classical architectural style.  Some professional reviewers of this film have suggested that the public square is a veiled reference to Hitler and Nazism. Indeed, one could argue that the film's subtext is an indictment of fascism.""Suspiria"" is not for everyone.  It is unsettling, and at times grisly.  The plot is weak, and plot elements are not really explained.  The acting is largely irrelevant.  And while the background music is suitably gothic, it is also frantic and monotonous.The best approach to this ""art-house"" film is to ignore the superficial plot, and focus instead on the fabulous cinematography, and the gothic images as conceptual metaphors.",Suspiria
80,kirbylee70-599-526179,AN ARGENTO CLASSIC CLEANED,9,29 March 2018,"Once more I have to make note of the fact that when watching a movie you have to transport yourself back to the time when the movie was released. I often use the example of my uncle telling me of the time he was a child and saw the original KING KONG and then had to walk home among the hills of West Virginia, certain that the ape would be around the next corner. And yet today we view the movie as quaint and it frightens no child. With that in mind think of the year 1977 when Dario Argento's SUSPIRIA was released.This was a year before DAWN OF THE DEAD was released unleashing a ton of gore onto screens. It would be a year before Carpenter's HALLOWEEN filled us with dread and 2 years before the slasher genre kicked into full gear with FRIDAY THE 13TH. So the amount of blood spilled in films was fairly small. Argento's SUSPIRIA received a major push when released to the US and soon found its audience among the many horror fans looking for something new. They found it, and a gratuitous amount of blood, in this film.The story revolves around Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), a young American who comes to Germany to study dance at the famed Tanz Dance Academy. She arrives late in the middle of a thunderstorm, pulling up to the front door in a torrential downpour and watching as a young woman runs from the building and into the rain. When she is refused entrance, Suzy heads for town to find a hotel. Along the way she sees the woman running through the woods.The woman is Pat (Eva Axen) and she flees to the apartment of a friend in fear for her life. She tells her she discovered something terrible at the Academy and then goes to dry herself off. While looking out the window she is attacked by something unseen and shortly after hung from a cord and thrown through a decorative skylight. Pieces from the skylight also kill her friend.The following day Suzy returns to the Academy and is set up to room in an apartment nearby with one of the other students. After falling ill during rehearsals she is moved into the room once occupied by Pat. She makes friends with fellow student Sara (Stefania Casini) who later tells her of the suspicions Pat had concerning the Academy. On bed rest due to her collapse, Suzy is slow to recover. And at night after dinner she continues to fall asleep quickly and easily.Suzy and Sara begin attempt to put together the clues they find as to what Pat had discovered. They comb her notes and follow each lead they can. An infestation of maggots forces the students to bunk in the practice room where Sara swears she can hear the elderly owner of the Academy wheezing nearby. The deeper the girls dig the more danger they are in. The truth behind it all is revealed in the end.Argento had begun his career directing with three films often referred to as his animal trilogy. With SUSPIRA he began working on was later termed his three mothers trilogy, a set of three films that would take 30 years for him to complete (INFERNO came out in 1980 and MOTHER OF TEARS in 2007). The end result of the trilogy is mixed but this, the initial installment, was lauded by critics and fans both.The movie is incredibly stylized with a use of color rarely found in American films but that seem to be associated with Italian movies, horror films in particular. The use of bright colors by director Mario Bava in BLOOD AND BLACK LACE comes to mind (also available from ARROW VIDEO). Where most horror films deal in shades of black and gray Argento's world takes place in a land of garish reds, greens and blues, all lit to the extreme and very visible. Horror in the shadows is something we expect as viewers, in the middle of a modern day setting with these colors and pop styling on screen it becomes unsettling in a different way.The story seems confusing at times but can be followed if one pays attention. Like nearly every horror film made there are things that take place to question (such as why doesn't anyone consider that Suzy is being drugged when she falls asleep every night after eating?) but those are minor. We've come to expect things like that and turn a blind eye to them so that we might enjoy the movie as a whole.The soundtrack to the film, performed and composed by the progressive rock band Goblin, goes hand in hand with the movie. Argento went on to use them in other films as well and they went on to do the score for George Romero's classic DAWN OF THE DEAD as well. Each note pulses and creates a tension in a style unlike any used before. A rhythm is established when fright sequences occur rather than the sudden explosive outburst of sound we'd come to expect in most horror films. It works incredibly well.The performances are all exceptional and carry over well on the parts of actresses speaking Italian and known for films made there. This was just Harper's fourth film but you couldn't tell from the performance she gives. She's quite believable in the role of Suzy. Casini does a commendable job as well offering the perfect balance between gossipy school girl and frightened woman once she discovers the answers to what is going on. Only Joan Bennet who began her career in the 30s and 40s before being rediscovered when she went to work on the TV gothic soap DARK SHADOWS seems lacking when it comes to acting skills here.The end result is an amazing movie given new life by Synapse Films. For the first time the film is being made available in blu-ray format with an exclusive 4k restoration from the original uncut and uncensored negative 35mm Italian film negative. In addition to that the extras are formidable. They include 2 audio commentary tracks with authors and Argento scholars Derek Botelho, David Del Valle and Troy Howarth, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WITCHES? a 30 minute SUSPIRIA visual essay written/edited/narrated by Michael Mackenzie, SUZY IN GERMANY a featurette on the German locations used in the film, A SIGH FROM THE DEPTHS: 40 YEARS OF SUSPIRIA an all new anniversary retrospective on the making of the film and its influence on cinema, OLGA'S STORY an interview with Barbara Magnolfi, the original theatrical trailers, TV spots and radio spots, an opening credit sequence from the U.S. release, alternate all-English opening and closing credit sequences and reversible cover art from artists Joel Robinson.Fans of Argento will make this a definite must have to complete their collection. Horror fans as well since the film has been hailed as one of the best horror movies ever made. The VILLAGE VOICE ranked it #100 among their top 100 greatest films of the 20th century. EMPIRE magazine ranked it #312 on their top 500 movies ever made list. And ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY ranked it #18 among their list of top 25 horror scariest films ever. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe it's not a film that just Argento fans need to add to their collection. Maybe it's a film that ALL movie fans need to add to their collection.",Suspiria
81,NateWatchesCoolMovies,an intoxicating fever dream,10,4 December 2016,"How to describe Dario Argento's Suspiria. A psychedelic, multicolored mood piece. Free from the bonds of rationality. Surreal and incoherent, using dream logic to disorient the viewer and lull us into a subconscious fugue state, swept away by the color and light, all shot through a prism of dazzling underworld enchantment, a fairy tale designed to shock and shake, and all the while presided over by Goblin's rhythmic, haunting score, bewitching the proceedings even further and pushing the atmosphere of the film to elemental heights. No other horror film I've ever seen has had quite the same unique, spellbinding effect on me as this masterpiece. The opener still stuns, a kaleidoscope of stained glass splattered in blood, a jarring murder scene that is as beautiful as it is grotesque, setting the stage for the madness yet in store. You know those dreams where you're making your way through some corridor, drenched in fear and awaiting some doom that's just up around the bend, but suddenly you get there and nothing seems to make sense, circumstances are now different and all attempts to extricate yourself seem hopeless? That's the kind of nightmare that young American ballet student Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) finds herself in. Arriving in Germany to a prestigious dance academy, she gets a fleeting look at some poor girl running from something, far off in the woods. That being her introduction to the school isn't a good sign, and it doesn't get any better. The stern headmistress (Allida Valli would give Miss Trunchbull the creeps) is overbearing and nasty, the rest of the occupants strange and withdrawn, and something seems to live inside the walls, watching Suzy from unseen perches, with evil intent in store. Maggots, a possessed dog, witches, a serial murderer and homicidal German cooks don't even begin to describe the gauntlet of terror she fights through. Well, they do, but the film really isn't about those things, they're just the walls of the gingerbread house, plain, right angled and sensibly threatening. The real horror and unease comes from atmosphere, the icing, sprinkles and decorative splendour on said house. Argento has always given more effort towards atmosphere and ambiance, in favor of things like acting, story or editing. It can be silly sometimes, but in Suspiria's case it really doesn't matter much, because the hellish haunted house he fashions is worth every second of your attention. There seems to be a starkly colored hue pouring in through every window and behind every door, the academy itself is an ornate and impossibly detailed dark gem of architecture and artistry, the sets put together like a dizzying labyrinth funhouse of brightly lit orifices and shadowed alcoves where nothing seems to be in it's rightful place, disorder and abstraction reigning supreme. And then there's the score. Now one of the most iconic janglers in the horror genre, the trancelike nocturnal lullaby by Goblin is a riff that instantly stands your hairs up and sucks you right into each frame, accenting the colours, shapes and hallways with organic precision, as if the dark forces inside the academy were somehow generating this music of their own accord. I also note another track by the group that makes an appearance, a wheezy death cry called 'Sighs', signalling that witches are nearby and consequently upping the unease factor a few more notches. This is a film that seems to come straight from the unconscious mind, a technicolor patchwork quilt stitched together with bizarre ideas, supernatural mysteries and otherworldly hysteria, with only the briefest threads of logic woven in, almost as if to further throw us off balance, to tease us with a scenario that seems like it will play out 'normally', only to toss us right back into the deep end, back into bizarro world with Suzy and all the forces of the night, clamouring to get her. This is unquestionably Argento's best, and most complete film, a maniacal masterpiece of gorgeous sights and sounds, a trip to another realm via our world, and a horror piece unlike any other.",Suspiria

Not because of the gore or violence, but because of all of the colors, lights, and the eerie music. ""Suspiria"" is about an American dancer, Suzy Banyon, who travels to Europe to attend a ballet school in the middle of the woods. While staying there, Suzy makes some new friends, but also begins to notice strange things happening at the school that she can't explain. Then people start to die in really gruesome ways, and it appears that something along the lines of witchcraft is involved.I don't want to spoil it, but this isn't a slasher movie (like it may sound from my brief plot outline). It is more of a supernatural murder-mystery type film. ""Suspiria"" really sets a mood and a feeling for it, and the music by Goblin is creepy and unlike anything I've heard before. The score itself is enough to give you the creeps - it's very effective. It has an intense, unique atmosphere too, primarily because of the amazing sets and the vivid colors. The colors used here are great, all kinds of bright pinks, blues, yellows, etc, usually contrasting with bloody murders and gruesome images, resulting in an interesting final product. Not often to do you see such bright tones in horror films, and that makes this film really stand out. The whole movie is very colorful, and is surely eye candy, this even includes the colorful tones of blood used in the movie. There are also some creative and extremely violent murders that will have you wanting to look away from the screen. Good acting from all involved, (Harper leads the film well) and wonderful, surrealistic direction by Argento. The opening scene was very, very gruesome, and sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is peppered with some solid jolts, savage murders, and hallucinatory visuals. And the final 12 minutes are guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat - I know that I sure was. I'd recommend this, and if you want to buy it on DVD, get the 3-disc limited edition set, it's the way to go. Trust me, I bought it and it's a lot better than the regular DVD release, it includes the regular film disc with a slew of features, and the 2 additional discs are a documentary and the hair-raising soundtrack CD. They even threw in some collectible stills and a thick booklet. The price is worth owning this classic in such a nice set.Overall, ""Suspiria"" is a horror masterpiece with beautiful colors contrasting with brutal carnage, threaded together in a mystery that will hold the viewer's attention the whole way through. It's not often that you find a horror film that is quite so graceful and artistic, and ""Suspiria"" is one of the few. Not to mention the score Argento uses, which will draw you in and set an uncomfortable, spooky mood -it's difficult to describe, and almost one of those things you have to see for yourself - granted, it's probably not a movie for everyone. For me though, this stands as one of the best horror films of all time. 10/10.",Suspiria
83,EVOL666,Italian Horror Masterpiece By The Master Himself - Dario Argento,9,11 October 2005,"Suspiria is one of Argento's best films ever. It also ranks high in my personal best horror films ever. The story is about Suzy, an American girl who travels to Germany to study ballet, and begins to realize that something isn't quite right with the Academy. Come to find out the Academy is run by a coven of witches, and all hell is gonna break loose.Very atmospheric and genuinely chilling, with great usage of color and sound - Suspiria is a true classic, not to be missed by anyone who considers themselves a horror-fan. The only issue I have at all with this film is the amateurish special effects at the end that really date the picture - but this can be overlooked for the fact that it is such a good film otherwise, and was also shot in 1977. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up if you haven't already... Highly Recommended 9/10",Suspiria
84,Witchfinder-General-666,"Horror Masterpiece, Stunning In Every Aspect",10,13 September 2007,"Dario Argento's cult masterpiece ""Suspiria"" of 1977 is an ingenious and incomparable piece of Horror art, and, as far as I am concerned, one of the greatest and most important Horror movies ever brought to screen. Dario Argento is one of the living directors I have the greatest respect and admiration for, and ""Suspiria"" is widely considered to be his greatest achievement. For good reasons, that is. In my opinion, this is Argento's greatest movie along with ""Profondo Rosso"" of 1975 and the vastly underrated ""Phenomena"" of 1985 (his brilliant 1970 directorial debut ""The Bird With The Crystal Plumage"" also comes very close), and the ideal proof that Argento is the absolute master of style, atmosphere and spine-chilling suspense. Argento's directing, the brilliant interaction of colorful visual style, ingenious Progressive Rock soundtracks by Goblin and the creepiness, ultra-violent brutality and stunning suspense that will keep you on the edge of your chair throughout an entire movie are incomparable, and ""Suspiria"" is the movie that unites all these qualities in the most brilliant manner, an out-and-out masterpiece that epitomizes the term 'Horror' like hardly another film, and that easily ranges among the most atmospherically overwhelming Horror films ever made.American ballet student Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) comes to Germany in order to study on a renowned dance academy. It soon becomes evident, however, that the academy is not only famous, but also haunted by something evil, as more and more mysterious and exceptionally gruesome murders occur...As mentioned above, ""Suspiria"" is pure perfection in style, photography and score. Argento's unique color-play goes hand in hand with gruesome violence, and a perfect score by Goblin. The acting performances are great, Jessica Harper is excellent in the lead, and Alida Valli delivers a brilliant performance as the strict dancing instructor Miss Tanner. The cast furthermore includes the legendary Joan Bennet, and German character actor Udo Kier.Seldom have colorful beauty and gruesome brutality matched so perfectly as it is the case with Dario Argento's movies, above all with ""Suspiria"". Those who are very sensitive with violence in movies should be warned: Dario Argento has the well deserved reputation of being extreme in the graphic depiction of violence, and ""Suspiria"" is one of the movies that have earned him this reputation. The gruesome acts of violence are (very stylishly) depicted in explicit detail, and the film is certainly not for the easily offended. Everybody else, make sure to watch ""Suspiria"" uncut and prepare for one of the most stylish and suspenseful cinematic experiences ever brought to screen. Eerie, ultra-violent and highly atmospheric, ""Suspiria"" is an utterly brilliant masterpiece of Horror, and a personal favorite of mine that Horror fans and lovers of cinema in general can not afford to miss! The absolute proof that Argento is a genius of style and suspense, ""Suspiria"" is one of the most ingenious masterpieces the great genre of Horror has ever brought forth! 10/10",Suspiria
85,caspian1978,Color and Sound,7,31 July 2004,"You are either a fan or not a fan of Argento's horror genre. His direction adds to the thrill of his movies, but not as much as his use of color and sound. The over powering musical score and sound coming from movement of the characters or the settings help make the horror come alive. The use of color also brings a feel and a look to the movie that no other film maker has reproduced since. Suspiria is loved or hated by today's audience. It will either rank high or low by today's audience standards. In my opinion, the movie has its moments but falls apart in many scenes. The script and story fail to keep my attention. Too many people whispering about something that is obvious, but still confusing to the audience lacks character and drive. The script has several holes that remain unfilled by the close of the movie.The direction is slow at times but picks up in the right areas. Still, besides the terrific use of color and sound, Suspiria falls short of anything terrific. A classic for its time, the movie sits on the shelves at the local video store, waiting to be watched. A cover of dust blocks the title on its box cover.",Suspiria
86,Jonny_Numb,An Inconsistent Hypnosis,6,1 October 2007,"It is hard NOT to be knocked back during that first-ever viewing of ""Suspiria""--with its flourishes of style and overwhelming use of color, I became a great admirer of the film after its initial run through my VCR. But, years later, the film simply doesn't click as well as it once did (for me, anyway). I just finished watching it for probably the half-dozenth time, and spent most of my viewing trying to figure out why its impact has diminished so drastically. ""Suspiria"" is not a BAD film, but its very virtues almost work against it--as with most of Dario Argento's other films, a plot synopsis is irrelevant; the gore, intricate cinematography, and gore is the point. Yet ""Suspiria""'s plot is a muddle (and best left to a one-line description: ""a dance academy run by a coven of witches"") that draws away from the aesthetic pleasures of Argento's visual composition every time he dwells on exposition that comes off as confusing (and confused) within the context of the story (co-scripted by Argento and Daria Nicolodi). Unlike his (then-)Italian-horror contemporary, Lucio Fulci, Argento is a far more calculating director; while we can watch ""Suspiria"" and have no doubt of a master stylist at work, this attention to aesthetic detail makes the clichéd characters and the convoluted story even more apparent, thus causing the intended effect to backfire: if there's not a single relatable character on-screen, it becomes that much harder to connect with the material. While certain characters have a quirky appeal (the blind pianist, the butch instructor, the hulking Romanian butler), others--like Sarah (Stefania Casini)--come close to breaking through the saturated colors to earn our sympathy, only to be swept away by Argento's stylistic undertow. While Jessica Harper makes a passable protagonist, her role is limited to being worry-eyed and confused throughout (I know how she felt). ""Suspiria"" will forever have a place in the history of horror cinema (my ""6"" is reflective solely of Argento's style and Goblin's score, which is still impressive today), but in the end, it is like being hypnotized in random bursts over the course of 98 minutes instead of a single unbroken trance that would have truly made it a masterpiece.",Suspiria
87,ShootingShark,It's Like The Thread Of Ariadne ...,8,25 March 2007,"Suzy Banyon is a young American who travels to Germany to study at a famous dance school, Frieburg Tanz Akademie. On the night Suzy arrives however, one of the students is brutally murdered and a friend, Sara, has some terrible suspicions about the teachers ...Some great movies are intellectual experiences (12 Angry Man), some are emotional experiences (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest), but my favourites are almost always sensory experiences - movies that are about nothing but image and sound. Suspiria is an amazing movie in this regard; an all-out assault on your eyes and your ears, with stunning direction, amazing use of colour, eye-popping sets and an incredible soundtrack. Prior to this, Argento made crime thrillers with tones of horror - with this film however it's as if he cut loose all ties to reality and went insane with artistic excess, to incredible effect. The film pulsates with life (the title literally means breathing), bleeding out glorious reds, blues and greens (it was deliberately printed using the old 3-strip Technicolor process) and the score by synth-rock band The Goblins screeches you into submission; it sounds like a bunch of lunatics growling and hitting anything they could lay to hand in the recording studio. Argento lifts the whole movie into a unique fairy-tale horror universe with the simplest of shots (rain rushing down a drain, clothes on a washing-line, an empty square) and Luciano Tovoli's photography is outstandingly inventive throughout. There's a rear-tracking shot in a swimming-pool, a crane shot that hides behind a lightbulb, a moment where the camera drinks a glass of wine and countless other astonishing tricks which combine to create the most incredible fear effect. To some extent the cast play second fiddle to the wild imagery, but there are several great performances. Harper is unforgettable in the lead, a cult classic performance if ever there was, wandering bewildered through the action (I love confused performances, like Theresa Russell in Track 29 or Jason Statham in Snatch). Valli and Bennett (both of whom were great beauties in the youth) are wonderful as the horrible old crones, Casini is terrific as the doomed Sara, and Magnolfi and Kier have great little roles. Detractors of this type of movie always pontificate on plot illogic or silly moments (""Looking for Sarah ? She's disappeared !"" is one of my favourite lines), thereby missing the complete entire point of the experience - cinema isn't reality, there are no rules and the wilder the ride the more fun to be had. I only wish more filmmakers had the courage and the technical ingenuity to make such as a sensational and audacious film. Written by Argento and actress Daria Nicolodi (who is in several of his other movies, but not this one). One of the scariest, creepiest, most original horror films ever made, with an unforgettable score; an absolute must-see for all lovers of pure cinema.",Suspiria
88,truemythmedia,Unforgettable,10,15 June 2019,"Argento was on a roll in the 70s, and this might be his crowning achievement (this or ""Deep Red""- depending on the day I prefer one over the other). This is a film that lives on its style, and for some people, like myself; we'll gravitate towards movies like this over and over again because we find them brilliantly original and incredibly appealing. This is a movie that I'm sure I'll watch a dozen more times in my life (this viewing was already my second time this year)- just like I'm sure I'll watch many of Argento's films multiple times in my life. He's a director that works perfectly for me on so many levels, and even when his direction doesn't always work, I'm willing to forgive him because he has such a unique voice. This movie is amazing; see it twice, buy it on Blu-Ray, and hang a poster in your house. It's that good.",Suspiria
89,a_chinn,Insane dreamlike nightmare version of film horror,10,17 July 2018,"Writer/director Dario Argento's modern day horror masterpiece still holds up as a brilliant and disturbing piece of filmmaking. With a strong emphasis on visuals, musics, and atmosphere, the film tells the hallucinatory tale of Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), an American ballerina who joins a prestigious European ballet school, but begins to suspect the school is harboring some sort of secret following a series of mysterious events, not the least of which is a series of bloody horrific deaths. ""Suspiria"" is probably one of the scariest films ever produced and certainly has the most frightening horror film score of all-time, which was composed by Argento and the prog rock band Goblin. Prior to this film, Argento has mostly made Giallo thrillers (ultra-violent Hitchcockian type of thrillers) and had not done much in the way of supernatural horror, but he does an amazing job with the genre. What makes this film so scary is not so much the story, which is certainly serviceable, but it's Argento's direction, the wild production design, the stylish photography, and the over-the-top frightening music that make the film so memorable. There is no way anyone can watch this film and not have it burned into your memory as something wholly unique. I will concede that this film will not be everyone's cup of tea and that there will be many who will watch this film and find it off-putting and/or ridiculous and even an endurance test, but I find this film to be an amazingly unique surreal nightmare and an example of ""pure cinema.""",Suspiria
90,Reviews_of_the_Dead,A Beautiful Classic from a Master of Horror,10,20 November 2018,"I want to lead off stating that I am a big fan of director and co-writer of this film Dario Argento. My father introduced me to him at a young age without realizing it showing me a film called Demons in which he was the producer. He also helped out on my favorite horror film of all time, the original Dawn of the Dead. I have started to check out his other films and through recommendations from podcasts I listen to, I checked this film out. The official synopsis is an American newcomer to a prestigious German ballet academy comes to realize that the school is a front for something sinister amid a series of grisly murders.
This film has an interesting idea. I love the concept of a school that seems normal to have a front like it does. Having the duality of the characters to put on a façade for the public and then do things behind closed doors. This is a fear that we have. It isn't that much different then working or living next to someone who turns out to be a murderer. This film plays on that fear. The mystery of this film is good as well and I enjoyed seeing it unfold. You don't know if this is really a coven until the end, you don't know who is involved or how far it goes.
Now some of the things that Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) uncovers I think is slightly convenient, but being a film I can suspend disbelief a bit. I have come to learn after that first viewing, this is Argento using the giallo film and that feel is in the film how things are solved. I did feel also that some of things in this film were a little spaced out and would like to have seen that tightened up. I do overlook it for the nightmare feel that the film seems to be going for. Looking at the scenes individually might be confusing, but the explanation we are given helps this.
As for the acting in this film, I will admit that I am a fanboy of Harper. I've seen her in a couple of other films and television shows, which has developed my crush on her. This role is slightly different than things I've seen in her before and I liked it. She is poisoned a lot throughout this film that makes her sleepy and she played that well. I also enjoyed the fear that I see on her face as she investigates what is going on.
The rest of the cast really didn't have much stand out for me, but they played their roles well. Stefania Casini seems unhinged from the beginning and when you learn that she had a mental breakdown after her mother passed away, it makes sense. It also makes her unreliable. Alida Valli and Joan Bennett are perfect opposite each other. They take on almost a good cop/bad cop feel to have they deal with the girls. It was also great to see Udo Kier, who is a great actor make a brief cameo in this film.
Again not to gush too much, but I loved the soundtrack to this film. Goblin is a band that is used a lot by Argento. I was first introduced to them with their work in the original Dawn of the Dead, where Argento worked with George A. Romero. Their music in this film really stood out and it makes the scenes that much creepier, even ones that didn't necessarily needed to be. It sent the tone. Something else about it is that has a human sound quality that helps the feel it gives.
The practical effects in this film were great. I'm glad this film was made when it was, because they couldn't utilize computers. Some of the kills you can clearly tell are not really the person, but it still looks quite life like. You get the feeling that a knife is really entering a person or seeing someone's throat slit. I am a big fan of what was used here to make me cringe. The only time I had an issue is there's a fake bat in one scene. Other than that though, it is amazing.
I feel that the editing for the most part was very well done. The film builds tension until the climax and the payoff was worth it. I also want to comment on the use of color and the settings. If you have read other reviews of this film, then you know that Argento and especially this film uses color amazingly. Much of this film has red, blue or yellowish lights that are cast on the characters. It gives such an eerie feel. Going from there, the sets have such interesting color and designs that it makes the film even more beautiful. This film was also the last to use Technicolor to enhance the colors used. It also has such an odd dreamlike feel. Many of the doors in the school are much larger than the actors. It gives it a very surreal feel.
Now with that said, I would highly recommend seeing this film. It is a perfect blend to me of combining elements of a slasher with supernatural. This film has a lot of elements of the giallo film, which Argento is a master of. This film does have some issues with things not completely making sense and just has a little bit of lull at times, but it is far from boring. Harper was great to me and the rest of the cast round the film out. The soundtrack was amazing and set the tone. I really enjoyed the practical effects and his use of color. The editing helps to build tension until we get that payoff we need at the end of the film. This is about witches, but it goes much beyond that. I will warn you that this is from 1970s and is foreign. It is dubbed in English, but Argento was great at making it where it doesn't bother me that all the actors' lines don't match their lips. Wanted you to know that when decided to view this film or not, but I would highly recommend seeing this one if you love horror.",Suspiria

The first time I saw it, it blew we away with the vivid colors, the soundtrack and how brutal some of the deaths were. The more I've seen it, the more I realize how good this film really is though for sure. To get into this, the synopsis is an American newcomer to a prestigious German ballet academy comes to realize that the school is a front for something sinister amid a series of grisly murders.We start with a voice-over from co-writer/director Dario Argento. He tells us about our young American woman, Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), as she arrives in Germany. It's raining outside and coming down hard. It takes her some time to get a cab and she goes to the school. Once she arrives, a woman comes out and is yelling to someone inside, she is Pat Hingle (Eva Axén). She then flees into the night. Suzy rings the bell and is told to go away by a voice. She gets back into the cab and watches as Pat runs away from the school through the woods.She finds refuge with a friend and goes into her bathroom to dry off. The wind blows the window open and she screams. The friend comes in and closes it, telling her there is nothing there. Pat is left in the bathroom and stares out the window. She sees eyes and is attacked by an arm. Her friend goes for help until Pat falls through a skylight window.. Her killer put a rope around her neck causing her to hang.Suzy returns to the school the next day and is informed that she has been expected. She meets with a teacher Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and the headmistress Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett). There isn't a room immediately ready for her so she has to stay with Olga (Barbara Magnolfi). There are police there investigating the murder of Pat in which Suzy shares the encounter she had with her.The second day at the school, something happens to Suzy and all of her stuff is moved into a room at the academy against her wishes. There's something strange going on at this school and her new friend Sara (Stefania Casini) tells her what she knows. It appears she was close to Pat and confides in Suzy. This makes her a target though as well.I want to lead off stating that I am a big fan of Argento. My father introduced me to him at a young age without realizing it by showing my sister and I a film called Demons. He was a producer there.

This film plays on that fear. The mystery of this film is good as well and I enjoyed seeing it unfold. I like that it really isn't until late in the film that we actually learn the truth. On top of that though, Suzy as she learns more doesn't necessarily believe and I like that. She is leery until she sees with her own eyes.As for the acting in this film, I will admit that I am a fanboy of Harper. I've seen her in a couple of other films and television shows, which has developed my crush on her. This role is slightly different than many of those things I've seen in her before and I liked to see it. She is poisoned a lot throughout this film that makes her sleepy.

The film builds tension in a way of a feeling. Jaime watched it with me this time and was saying that not a lot really happens. She is right as we get a few deaths, but it is more about atmosphere until the climax. On top of that, there is great writing of things that are introduced earlier as foreshadowing and come back later. I like how the mystery builds and then plays out in the end. Something else is that Argento did a lot of giallo films before this and this movie plays like one. It does have the supernatural, but I think that contributes to it being slower as well.I also want to comment on the use of color and the settings. If you have read other reviews of this film, then you know that Argento and especially this film uses color amazingly. Much of this film has red, blue or yellowish lights that are cast on the characters. It gives such an eerie feel. I do have to give credit here to Mario Bava, another great Italian director. Argento worked with him and that is where this influence is from. Going from there, the sets have such interesting color and designs that it makes the film even more beautiful. It also has such an odd dreamlike feel. Many of the doors in the school are much larger than the actors. It gives it a very surreal feel as if these adults are actually children as this was originally going to be younger actors.Now with that said, I would highly recommend seeing this film.

92,Samiam3,Gorgeous horror film,8,27 May 2010,"If this is your first introduction to Italian auteur Dario Argento, you may fall in love with him, even before the movie ends. Suspiria, much considered his finest, is almost an opera of a horror film, unlike anything else from it's time (except Argento's other film's). Even today, it is extremely distinctive, and although I am probably among the world's last of horror fans to feast my eyes on it, if there is anyone else who has not seen it, go for it.American cutey Susan Bannion hops across the pond to attend the famous TAM ballet academy in Rome. The place is moderately friendly but also unusual. as the nights progress tediously, Strange signs lead Suzy to suspect that there may be witchcraft a foot in the place.The plot is actually pretty thin, but it doesn't feel that way. Suspiria is stretched out slowly, and while it's scariness is middling at best, Argento successfully makes the whole thing feel very subjective, subtle and fragile, as if life hangs by a thread. Argento's vision is a highly eccentric manipulation of colour, shape, and sounds intended of course to provoke the feeling of being in a haunted house, which is just as eerie during the day as it is during the night. These sets would be a great place to stage a music video, among other things. Suspiria has much to offer for anyone who gives it a try, I doubt if it will scare the pants off you, but then again, that is not really the film main intention. It is an experiment in the art's and crafts of cinematic design and it's result are more than satisfactory.",Suspiria
93,ctomvelu1,Witchery,8,27 February 2010,"For my money, SUSPIRIA is Argento's greatest work. An American dancer (Harper) joins a ballet school in Germany, only to realize the school is a haven for witches. Various people die, and she is targeted for her suspicions. There are two outstanding death scenes: a blind man walking with his seeing eye dog is abruptly attacked by the dog. And a ballet student ends up falling into a room full of razor wire. The ending is spooky although a bit silly. Someone should have told Argento witch films can become unintentionally arch or camp even when they are played straight. Strong on atmosphere, weak on logic, so-so on acting ability, SUSPIRIA is a good place to start your Argento collection.",Suspiria
94,nycritic,Which Witch is (You Know the Rest)...,10,3 August 2005,"If the story weren't so blatantly ridiculous, subtle as an elephant sitting in the middle of a dining room and overdone, SUSPIRIA might as well be another by-the-numbers horror movie with carefully placed shocks and a final revelation where the Final Girl either emerges triumphant from her ordeal or succumbs to her fate.For a movie categorized as Italian Giallo, there is actually very little extreme scenes of gore as in other films of this genre. If anything, Dario Argento art directs this movie within an inch of its life, to a point where it actually succeeds to separate itself from its horror roots and begins to open itself to a perverse fairy tale. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are one of the most tense moments of mounting horror I have seen in a while (despite the horrible dialogue and the bad dubbing, courtesy of what seems to be the norm of Italian movies of the period). Its setup, consisting of Jessica Harper's character, Susie Bannion, arriving at the school of dance that she is to attend in the middle of a storm. (Why she doesn't take the ""storm"" as a signal that maybe this might not be the ideal place for her is anyone's guess.) A girl, Pat Hingle, runs out screaming into the night and winds up at the neighboring dorm where a friend takes her in, but soon later she meets a grisly fate in a fantastic sequence that has become a classic all its own.What's shocking is not the absolute terror that reaches this early pitch in SUSPIRIA (compressing the horror which happens in PSYCHO by half an hour and setting the stage to the events which follow even when in retrospect they make little sense): it's the way it's set up. Instead of going for dark, moody colors or the more modern technique of filtering a sickly green or sepia or blue color to enhance elements of dread, instead of utilizing a dark-ambient theme with the occasional crashing violin, Argento decides to flood the scene in an orgy of color, rapid editing, and its unsettling, feverish Goblin score reminiscent of ""Tubular Bells"" with more primeval howls and drums, which escalate until they're practically reverberating all over the film. This is stunning, beautiful horror, a fable gone to the extreme perverse, technique over substance taken to its maximum level. SUSPIRIA is, quite simply, one of the best horror films ever made, and despite its age, it does not show it and proves that the oldest tricks in the book still work perfectly well. Watch it and enjoy, for this is a masterpiece.",Suspiria
95,p-stepien,The ultimate Argento,6,3 August 2010,"Susan Bannion (Jessica Harper) arrives in Europe aiming to hone her dance skills in a world famous school in Freibourg. Placed in a remote location just outside of town and surrounded by woods the school is set in an old eerie building saturated with colour (naturally mostly in Argento's beloved red). On the night of her arrival to Germany in the midst of a great thunderstorm she is locked out of the school, whilst at the same time witnessing a seemingly terrified fellow American flee it . That same night the American is murdered (in one stunning and memorable murder scene)... The following morning Susan finally enrols into the school only for the more mystery and terror to persist...Dario Argento's masterpiece is in many ways perfect. This especially concerns the tone in which the movie is filmed and the never-subsiding suspense, which makes this movies extremely creepy despite never really offering much visual shockers (and one quite terribly poor bat attack scene). Permeating in red and blue hue the whole movie has an unmistakable feel to it that has become Argento's trademark. And as such the whole film together with the remarkable blooming set-pieces is a visual masterpiece with certain scenes and shots guaranteed to remain in memory long after the movie itself has been forgotten.The main reason I however forfeited on giving the movie a higher mark has most to do with the story itself. I was never a great fan of Argento's stories and scripts - often extremely rudimentary and leaving a sense of being highly underdeveloped or even rushed. Characters are also very underdeveloped and the poor acting coupled with sub-par dubbing never helps. In the case of Suspiria the mystery behind the killings keeps you on the edge of the seat for most of the film, but in the end the final act and the resolving of the story leaves you deeply unsatisfied. Would love to give a bigger shout out to Argento for his most important film, but I am unable to ignore to deeply disappointing plot to the otherwise terrific movie.Additional kudos for the tremendous lead musical motiff recorded by The Goblins.",Suspiria
96,justin-fencsak,The original and the best of the versions!!!,10,30 January 2019,"Out of all the films that Dario Argento directed in his career, one stands out: Suspiria. The title comes from the italian word for sighs, and it feels that way with lots of reddish color, a haunting soundtrack by Goblin, and excellent performances by stars from Italy and America making this 96 minute film a true horror classic that should be seen to be believed. The 4k restored version on 1080p bluray from Synapse Films is a must buy for the casual fan. Forget the remake and see this film instead.",Suspiria
97,lemon_magic,All About Art Direction!,8,8 October 2013,"Argento made his mark as a director as a master of style and visual flair, and nowhere is this more obvious than in ""Suspiria"". Although the screenplay isn't explicitly a fantasy or a fable, it seems to be set in an alternate world where walls and gardens and backgrounds scream and vibrate with color and icons and swirling shapes, to the point where it is sometimes difficult to actually pay attention to the actors. Sights and sounds are cranked up to the point of absurdity and I tend to finish his films feeling as if I'd been forced to take peyote and then roll strapped in a wheelchair through a MOMA exhibition with my eyelids propped open by toothpicks.I'm OK with that though. Sometimes you want something subtle and creepy, and sometimes you just want the movie to grab you by the throat and shake you until your teeth rattle like castanets.Yes, the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense in spots, and yes, things are being done for shock value alone, and no one is going to award the screenplay a Nobel prize for literature...but damn, this movie is an experience that every devoted horror fan should try to see at least once.",Suspiria
98,Sandcooler,Gruesome masterpiece from a true horror legend,8,14 March 2015,"""Suspiria"" is usually considered to be an ideal starting point if you want to discover Dario Argento, but to me it's actually one of his least accessible movies. Something like ""Deep Red"" gives you much more familiar territory to work with, there's a serial killer on the loose and in the end we discover who it is: simple story, fairly simple execution. ""Suspiria"" on the other hand is different, because it relies much more on style. Storywise there isn't that much going on, it has a certain supernatural mystery aspect to it but you figure it out very quickly. The entire strength of the movie is not the solution of the mystery or the (rather weak) climax in the third act, it's all in how unsettling every single scene is. There's never a moment of relief, even in scenes where our main character is completely safe you still don't feel at ease. Argento has the talent to make something out of nothing, to scare you without giving you something concrete to be scared of. The screenplay to ""Suspiria"" is far from brilliant, but Argento's fantastic directorial choices make this a true classic.",Suspiria
99,Matt_Layden,The Visuals Make This Film Scary.,6,2 February 2006,"A young American woman travels to Europe to attend a school for dancing. When she begins to notice creepy images and sounds around the buildings she soon discovers that there is dark evil behind the walls.Dario Argento is known as the ""Master of the Macabre"". He has a very devoted cult following and granted he should. Argento has an impressive eye for colour and a great ear for music in his films to give them the uneasy feel of something eerie. Even though Suspiria is deemed his best work, it fails to keep the creep factor and shock value one would expect from the hands of Argento, and becomes a film that is more artistic then scary.Argento basically disregards the plot and decides to focus on colours and music to scare his audience. He does this beautifully, Suspiria is one of the few horror films that uses colour to it's advantage. The reds, blues and greens used in the film fit perfectly for each scene and turns them into a visual nightmare. Argento takes these scenes up a notch by adding eerie music, that blends with the colour scheme and go down in history as some of the scariest scenes in horror cinema.Suspiria opens with one of the most brutal deaths ever filmed on screen. A poor woman running away from her nightmares is stabbed, hung, stabbed again, ripped open and her heart stabbed, yet again. It is truly brutal and will stay in your mind well after the film is finished. The film has a hard time trying to continue it's shock and entertainment value after that scene though. Aside from two mediocre scenes that involve a dog's bite to the jugular and a room full of barbed wires, Suspiria falls victim to it's own success.You may be wondering why with all this beautiful work done on this film did I not enjoy it? Well, I did to an extent. It is a beautiful film and it is filmed very well from a director that knows exactly what he wanted to do. The only problem is that the film, with all it's artistic merit is boring. Yes, it is boring. When you want a horror film about witches and demons, you want something to keep you either on the edge of your seat or hiding behind a blanket. Other then the opening death scene the film is just a film to respect, not fear. I respect this film, I hold it in high regard for it's technical achievements, but for entertainment value, Suspiria fails to keep my attention. Suspiria is Argento's high point film, it is his best, but it's not at the same time.If you're a fan of Argento and appreciate his style, or a style like his, this film will astound you, you'll be in for a treat. If you want to see one of the most brutal deaths filmed for the screen, watch the beginning, then turn it off. Suspiria is an overrated film that is getting acknowledgements in the areas that it shouldn't.",Suspiria
100,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,A nightmare filmed in a nursery school,7,1 October 2016,"Pethaps its paper thin plot (a young girl going to study at a Berlin dance school, and discovering it is really a murderous coven of witches) was only ever intended to be an excuse to overcompensate with bright yellow walls and bright green clothes and and deep blue lighting and bizarre geometrical patterns, green windows contrasted with deep red lighting, oddly geometrical staircase against black wall in the dark of night...Indeed, such a thinly plotted horror would have probably sunk without a trace if it was not for its luxurious colour composition, and brilliant, deafening score, by Italian band, Goblin. The film succeeds in disorienting its audience with its visual and aural assault, making a mostly unimpressive plot terrifying as a result. Actors' hair blowing in their faces struck me as an odd touch in one scene, which most filmmakers would have reshot. By leaving that in the film (as opposed to filming the scene again, with their faces more consistently visible) it gave it a bit more realist moment, which seemed odd, in and of itself, in such a weird, disorienting film.",Suspiria

Certainly the intro is impressive, and the architecture, sets and score are all very good.But it's no more than a Nancy Drew mystery with some imaginative violence. Most of the dialogue is exposition, the dance environment has no connection to the plot, the coven is dull, the killings have no theme. And what happened to Olga? The most provocative character disappeared from the story with no explanation after ten minutes - a loaded gun that was never fired. And the heroine's love interest also disappears without trace. What a mess.",Suspiria
102,moviewizguy,The Only Thing More Terrifying Than The Last 12 Minutes Of This Film Are The First 92.,6,22 July 2013,"""Suspiria"" has been lauded as one of the greatest horror films of all time. While I don't agree with that statement, I won't deny its sheer craft. ""Suspiria"" is an all-around beautiful film to look at. Director Dario Argento's use of color, especially green and red, are nothing short of mesmerizing. The production design is lavish and detailed, and the composition of certain shots are just magnificent. Its palpable sense of atmosphere should also be commended, as some scenes really do convey the horror of the characters' situation.It's a shame, then, that not more attention was paid to its characters, story, and screenplay. The story unfolds very slowly, and it works for the most part. The buildup is really good, which kept me interested in what's happening. However, the film does run a bit too slow at times. The heroine doesn't figure out the mystery until the last 20 minutes of the film, although it's quite obvious where things are going. Even the soundtrack gives everything away; the chorus shouts ""Witch!"" every chance they get. Maybe I'm just biased towards strong female characters, but Jessica Harper's performance as the weak and oblivious Suzy made it hard for me to root for her. Following her revelation, the film fizzles out fairly quickly. After this great buildup, we are treated with a climax that is so disappointing, we are left wondering what was so evil and powerful about the old witch in the first place.The film's worst offender, ironically, is what made the film so memorable: the blaring soundtrack by Goblin. Some call it beautiful. Others call it haunting. I call it an assault to the senses. At times, I found the score to be so overbearing, it detracted me from certain parts of the film. Despite my negative attitude towards the soundtrack, there is a charming quality to it that makes it unique and memorable.There are many things to love about ""Suspiria."" For me, it would be its technical aspects. I have rarely seen a horror film that looked this damn good. However, appearances can only do so much. Only if you bother to look underneath the surface, you will find a screenplay that isn't up to par, a story that isn't very substantial, and characters that aren't particularly deep. But damn, is it good style.",Suspiria

104,sme_no_densetsu,Not perfect but uniquely memorable,8,10 November 2018,"Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" is routinely listed as one of the best horror movies of all time. Recently, a remake by ""Call Me By Your Name"" director Luca Guadagnino has brought it renewed attention more than forty years after its initial release. I haven't seen the remake so I can't compare the two but I suspect that it would be difficult to recreate the appeal of the original. Not that Argento's ""Suspiria"" is without its faults but it just seems to work in spite of them.The story concerns a young American woman who enrolls at a prestigious German ballet academy and finds herself embroiled in a mystery connected with a series of grisly murders. I'm not sure if it's by design or not but the plot is generally fairly vague with only faint hints of what is actually going on and who's behind it. Sometimes the movie seems vaguely dream-like which may just be a side-effect of the script not being as tightly constructed as it could be. Whatever the case, the script by Argento and his then-girlfriend Daria Nicolodi is a serviceable enough framework for the movie.As I see it, it seems that Argento put more emphasis on the visuals than the narrative. That's not such a bad thing, though, since the visuals are probably some of the best that you're likely to encounter in a horror movie. The movie's saturated colour palette creates images that are both beautiful and chilling. The soundtrack by Goblin (with input by Argento) is also pretty effective in establishing mood.The acting is a bit of a mixed bag, though; some of which comes down to the dubbing. Foreign actors/actresses being shoddily overdubbed by English speakers is to be expected in a movie like this but lead actress Jessica Harper didn't have that excuse to fall back on. Most of her line deliveries seem pretty wooden, especially when compared to accomplished vets like Alida Valli and Joan Bennett. Overall, the cast is acceptable but nothing more.In the end, though, the movie somehow works in spite of its flaws. The sumptuous visuals are clearly the major draw but even the movie's deficiencies in the script & acting departments often give the movie a somewhat surreal feel (which almost makes me wonder if it was intentional). Supposedly the story was inspired by dark fairy tales but I'm not really sure that I buy into that. Ultimately, I do think that ""Suspiria"" is worth watching but I would caution viewers to expect to have to take the good with the bad.",Suspiria
105,PimpinAinttEasy,Do NOT believe the hype and the cult following ..... It is AWFUL!,1,8 April 2016,"Pimpin gets Dario Argento drunk on Old Monk rum and records his statements:Argento: Yes. I confess. It is a piece of crap. Lol, I cannot believe the cult following this film has received over the years. 7.5 on 10 on IMDb. What a joke! Me and Nicolodi couldn't write a scene to save our lives. The jokes are puerile. The characters are just caricatures. No wait. Worse than caricatures. There is nothing in there. We did not even know how to develop the characters. And those sets. HAAHHAHAHAHA! I always feel like vomiting when I see that peacock with multi colored feathers in the final scenes. The whole film is a study in bad taste. That mirror with bulbs around it. And that golden staircase. HAHAHHAHAHA! It must have been the gaudiest Ballet school in Germany. And the music. Jesus Christ! Goblin! What was I thinking? That awful music with all that muted screaming and growling. I composed some of it myself. I should have got Morricone or something. The acting was terrible too. Jessica Harper is no leading lady. I should have got someone sexier. But there is one scene, that I like Pimpin. When Suzy Bannon visits the school for the second time, she enters a very small and claustrophobic room full of semi nude ballet girls who are dressing up. You can't deny that scene was pretty hot!Best Regards, Pimpin.(1/10)",Suspiria
106,gianmarcoronconi,Masterpiece,9,26 September 2021,"Horror film that can be called a masterpiece of the genre. The tension is always very high, the rhythms are tight and the music is wonderful.

The only flaw is that like many other horror films it has obvious logic problems but the latter take a back seat in front of the merits of this film.",Suspiria
107,Stephen_A_Abell,A Genuinely Beautiful Horror Film,8,27 March 2017,"Suspiria has a special place in my heart as it was totally breathtaking to watch as Dario Argento's visual and audio style is something to behold.Right from the start, as Suzy Bannion, elegantly portrayed by Jessica Harper, walks through the airport Argento gives the viewer a bright and colourful shot of her walking to the doors. He doesn't like to use filters but would rather use lighting and colour to create atmosphere. Each time we get a shot of the entranceway Argento brings in the electronic music then cuts it when we see Suzy again. This gives the feeling that something strange is awaiting her once she departs from the airport.Then when she's in the cab on the way to the academy he uses the driving rain, tense music and colours of red and blue to create an uneasy mood. This is throughout the film and was tremendous as it showed me another way to shoot movies, especially horror films as they relied too much on darkness. Even when in the dark Argento still gave the audience enough light to make out everything, opting for a blue haze. It also makes him work to find new ways to create suspense and tension.The other outstanding element is the lavishness of the sets. These are very stylistic and beautiful and add a magical facet to the story and the film. Later in the film, we realise why the academy is featured in such a prominent way.As I said in my review of Argento's Tenebre, he is a master of murder and death. Here it's the first murder that affirms the point. Argento makes it feel as though your watching a ballet, gruesome though it is.On this rewatching, I had to admit that I must have annoyed the neighbours in my youth when I originally watched it. I couldn't remember the music being so loud it overpowered the actor's lines. This could be something to do with the remastering, so when I watched this at night I had to ride the volume control up and down so I didn't get any neighbourly warning knocks on the wall. So be warned on that.Another drawback is the muddled story as you're never really sure where it's going or what's happening; though this might have been what writers Dario Argento and Daria Nicolodi were going for, to add to the unease of the story. That said it does distract from the film a little.If you like horror films and not seen an Argento movie yet then this and the other two in the Three Mothers Trilogy are a good place to start. You will see there are other ways to envisage horror films.",Suspiria
108,gizmomogwai,Moody but muddled,7,12 January 2013,"I've been putting off seeing Suspiria for a long time because I could only find it dubbed; I despise seeing dubbed movies, which looks goofy and bastardizes the movie. But Suspiria looked interesting enough that I finally gave in and had a look. An Italian horror film from 1977, Empire put this in its top 100 of world cinema and called it a ""moody masterpiece."" It is about an American girl who joins a dance school amid a series of violent deaths. It is revealed the school is run by witches.It's a bit hard to get passed my aversion to dubbing, which does hurt Suspiria a bit (the voice actors are awful). But even trying to put that aside, Suspiria didn't seem like a masterpiece to me. Some of it is a bit incoherent, at other times it falls flat. The maggots, for example, weren't that scary. When one girl makes snake noises and the other sticks out her tongue, I was wondering, what are they, 6? That said, the movie has good music (which does help to establish mood) and some interesting mystery (somewhat spoilt by the fact that it's well-known that the movie is about witches). I can imagine why it has a cult following, but don't think it's one of the better films of the '70s.",Suspiria
109,jaredmobarak,You have just watchedSuspiria,6,9 September 2008,"One of the characters summed up Suspiria quite concisely at the start of the film. She said, ""It's all so absurd, so fantastic."" I can't think of a better way to begin a description. Sure the gore factor is fake and overkill, the horrible dub job is laughable, and the story is just a jumbled mess that gets loosely tied together by a witch subplot with fifteen minutes left, but there is a lot to like here. The absurdity works for it by creating a dreamlike state and journey through an otherworldly German dance school. Its fantastical elements lend a way to become absorbed in its lush settings, helping allow us to forget the incoherence of it all. The cinematography is quite stunning at times and the use of color and light just magnificent. Add in a killer synth soudtrack from the Goblins and you have some very unsettling stuff. Can one appreciate a film for its artistic merits despite its crude script and performances? I say yes.With a plot concerning an American girl coming to Germany in order to be educated at a prestigious dance academy only to find money-hungry women and grisly murders, you can expect over-the-top craziness. When the darkness between two Greek inspired monuments can cause a dog to bite a man's jugular and kill him and a girl can jump out a window to safety only to fall into a pit of barbed wire, there are no rules. Writer/director Dario Argento seems to have used his fantasy theme as an excuse to show he can creatively kill off characters without being held realistically responsible. The occult plays a huge role in the film and all the weird deaths are easily linked together as events caused by an evil force emanating from the coven of witches that occupy and run the school. Dark magic has no bounds and it will inhabit whatever necessary to inflict the desired action. Whether it the wind, a yellowed snakelike eyed creature outside a window, an otherwise benign seeing eye dog, or one's own body, anything can become a vehicle for homicide.The end of the film really delves into the nightmare/dream state set forth from the start, making it remind me a lot of ""Twin Peaks"" and Lynch's Black Lodge with the Red Room. Every architectural setting utilized in the film seems to be a labyrinthine puzzle box to explore. Our lead Suzy eventually finds herself searching through the passageways and hallways in order to finally get some answers to what is happening around her. Turn the purple iris, open the door that holds the living dead, count the footsteps of the instructors to gauge where it is they are goingSuzy is strong willed and sets her mind without faltering. She will not be stopped or scared away from finding out the truth.Played with just the right mix of naïveté and power, Jessica Harper does an admirable job holding the film up. Her Suzy is caught in the middle of a struggle against dissenters at the school. No one can just leave because once they glimpse the truth, they know too much. She is drugged nightly, manipulated into staying at the school, and constantly experiencing death and disappearance of those around her. Effective as the innocent waif, she also makes her horror movie cliché actions appear thought out and possible due to her curiosity rather than stupid and plot progressing like most horror. She opens a door because she wants to, not because that's what we expect in the canon. The rest of the acting is effective, but unfortunately the performances that stick out are because of the horrible over-dubbing. Udo Kier, Mr. Thick German Accent himself, is dubbed over with flawless speech devoid of any accent. You could tell me that it's actually him dubbing his own lines, but I will not believe it. And then there is Rudolf Schündler as his professor colleague; his words are so off track from his mouth movements that I wouldn't be surprised if he was speaking a different language in the visuals. I guess it's all part of the charm and cult quality people have come to love.I will, however, completely praise the artistic merits on display. The set designs are sumptuous and extremely ornate. Each room is painted with a unique pattern and bright, bold colors. Whether an organic, flowery motif or geometrically sharp angles, the camera always tends to settle for at least a brief moment to show off the work. The apartment building that becomes the setting for our first murder is gaudy to perfection with its symmetrical design and colored overhead window. Even the shards of glass sticking out from a woman's body have a sense of beauty to them. But, it is the use of light that truly warrants accolades. The use of red is very prevalent, the connotation to blood an obvious connection, and the light and shadow working along with it helps set the mood with the loud, jarring soundtrack. Composition is carefully planned and through close-ups we are treated to some stunning visuals. The long depth of focus shots are my favorite, between the shot of a maid and the headmistress's nephew shrouded in bright light reflected from a knife to the view of the entranceway as we await Miss Tanner to walk through storming into the rehearsal room, nothing compares to the absolute first sequence. Commencing with Suzy in white against the crowds' sea of red, her approach to the exit is filled with the overpowering score as the camera cuts sharply to her face before the foreboding cut back to the door as its opened, letting the storm brewing outside to be shown. All the safety and security of her once simple life is about to be subjected to the tempest that will threaten to consume her.",Suspiria

Every single frame of this film is expertly lit and colorful. With this technique Argento manages to create an almost unbearable amount of tension and the extremely brutal and bloody murder sequences look so good one can only admire their beauty. The music score by Goblin is one of the most effective score ever to grace a horror movie.The story concerns an American ballet student who discovers that a coven of witches run the school as bodies begin piling up. Not much of a story here, but that's really not the main thing. Style and atmosphere is the main course here, and it's execution is completely flawless. Acting and dubbing are okay and the dialogue is a bit stiff. But these are minor flaws in an operatic horror ride one is not likely to forget that easily.So sit yourself down, turn out the light, and watch this movie in surround sound, 'cause the music alone will totally give you the creeps.",Suspiria

113,gftbiloxi,Hypnotically Beautiful But Weak In Plot,8,9 April 2005,"In 1977 SUSPIRIA was considered an extremely violent film; in the wake of the slasher genre, however, the violence involved seems less horrific than you might expect. What continues to work, however, is the look with which director Argento endows the film, particularly in regard to the set designs, camera set-ups, and use of color. Visually speaking, this is an amazingly beautiful film, with Art Nouveau designs, deceptively simple cinematography, and washes of intensely artificial color that dazzle with intensity. Even in the midst of its horrors it is almost impossible to take your eyes from the screen, such is its strange beauty.The cast is equally odd. Leads Jessica Harper and Stefania Casini are very typical of 1970s ingenues, but they each have a quality that sets them slightly apart from the young actresses of the time. Barbara Magnolfi makes an impression as Olga, one of the school's students, as does Susanna Javicoli as a harsh instructor. Even Udo Kier, cult star of Andy Warhol's FRANKENSTEIN and Dracula puts in an appearance. But oddest of all is Hollywood's Joan Bennett, who gives a truly flawless turn as the seemingly lady-like and ultra-respectable Madame Blanc.Less successful is the story itself, which is so slight as to be almost incidental. Young dancer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) has enrolled in a famous Italian ballet school--and upon her arrival finds another student fleeing the school in hysterics, a student who is not long after murdered in a horrifically brutal way. Odd incidents follow, and when Suzy's classmate and friend Sara (Stefania Casini) goes missing, Suzy begins to piece together the truth.Another flaw, at least to my mind, is the soundtrack. While it has been widely admired, I can think of few film soundtracks that are quite as heavy-handed in their dynamics as SUSPIRIA. That aside, and while the film has considerable creepiness, it isn't frightening per se. In the final analysis, this is a film which I think is best seen by cult connoisseurs--and even they are more likely to admire than to flatly like it.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Suspiria
114,jluis1984,The most beautiful horror movie ever,10,6 March 2006,"Dario Argento gained fame and worldwide recognition with the release in 1977 of ""Suspiria"". After years in the film industry as a writer (Sergio Leone's ""C'era Una Volta Il West"" being one of his best works) and later as director of great horror movies like ""Profondo Rosso"", he finally crafted what many consider one of his best movies so far, and one of the best horror movies ever.The story is a bit simple, as we follow Suzy (Jessica Harper), an American woman who has just been accepted in the most prestigious dance academy in Germany. In the night of her arrival, she notices a woman running away from the school. To her surprise, the woman will be found dead hours later. This is only the beginning of a series of strange events that will convince her that there is something evil in the school.While the plot may be simple (specially when compared to the rest of his work), what makes ""Suspiria"" special is the whole composition, the perfect mixture of plot, visuals & music to create emotions in the viewer. Every frame in the picture has a supernatural beauty that makes it look like a canvas. Argento's eye for the visuals has created a aesthetic work hard to equal (even by himself), as he has taken care of every piece of the film.The music is another important part of ""Suspiria"", as it complements the visuals in a perfect marriage. Argento's usual partners in crime, the band ""Goblin"", are in charge of the soundtrack and craft a haunting score that if even alone would be enough to create tension in the audience.Jessica Harper is very good in the lead role, however, Joan Bennet and Alida Valli are truly the stars of the show as the Headmistress & Suzy's teacher respectively. Both give superb performances and capture the attention in every scene they appear. Alida Valli is particularly scary in her role as a very strict teacher.The rest of the cast is very good in their small roles, although a notorious flaw is the fact that most of them were dubbed. Although this was a very common practice in Italian films during the 60s and 70s, the dubbing of ""Suspiria"" is at times odd and distracting. This may be the only major flaw in an otherwise perfect film.While not as violent as other works by Dario Argento, the film has its share of gore; and just as everything else in the film, the violence is done in a surreal, almost beautiful way. ""Suspiria""'s morbid beauty is both attractive and frightening, and maybe that was what Argento had in mind when he conceived the movie.This visually stunning film is definitely a classic not only of the horror genre, but of film history in general. 10/10",Suspiria
115,petra_ste,Red and blue,8,26 July 2014,"Worth revisiting after the likes of Giallo and Il Cartaio to remember who Argento used to be, Suspiria is dazzling, self-confident, the work of a master of horror at the top of his game.A chilling supernatural tale focused on a haunted dance academy in Freiburg, Suspiria oozes style. Fluid camera movements and an expressionistic use of red and blue colour palettes propel a serviceable script. Doomed victims roam around maze-like locations stalked by a roving, voyeuristic camera and are dispatched in canny set-pieces. Jessica Harper plays the delicate protagonist (who, in one of Argento's trademark tropes, struggles to remember a crucial sensory detail), while an astutely cast Alida Valli uses her piercing stare to unsettling effect.8/10",Suspiria
116,cchase,"The Italian ""Master of Suspense"" At His Peak...",9,4 December 2008,"The basic problem with so many movies that try to deliver on both gore and suspense is that they always give you too much of one, and not enough of the other. So when you see a lot of tired imitators, it's always refreshing to see a movie that somehow gets it right. And if you've seen movies like DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN and BLACK Christmas, you can thank your lucky stars that the filmmakers behind those gems were actually giving up props to the man who definitely knows how to get it right...Master of the 'gialli' genre, Dario Argento. His previous work on classics such as BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET and CAT O 'NINE TAILS were just red-splattered dress rehearsals for his masterpiece, SUSPIRIA, Part One of his unparalleled ""Three Mothers Trilogy.""Suzy Bannion (PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE'S Jessica Harper) comes from America to a big, brooding dance school in Bavaria to study ballet. What she soon discovers is that the only piece she needs to familiarize herself with is the ""danse macabre""...literally. She unwittingly begins to discover clues and signs that indicate that the school is being run by a coven of witches, bent on resurrecting one of the ""Three Mothers,"" three powerful witches from what was thought to be merely a fairy tale. But there's absolutely nothing ""fairy-tale"" about the first couple of deaths that occur within the initial fifteen minutes of the movie, which depicts one of the most spectacular murder sequences in horror movie history (and that includes PSYCHO.) The rich, vibrant use of color, (inspired allegedly by Disney's SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS), imprints itself on the senses in a way that doubles the sensory overload, provided by the shocks and the pounding, nerve-jangling score composed and performed by art-rock group Goblin, (the first of their many collaborations with Argento). Where most films are content to pile one shock-and-gore-sequence on top of another, Argento paces the audience by allowing the scenario to ebb and flow, ratcheting up the tension and suspense so that you almost can't wait to see what's coming next, and if it can possibly top the mind-bending terror that preceded it, (which in this case, it does.)Even with the clumsy dub job, (not surprising for films of this period), Jessica Harper and the mostly Italian cast deliver average-to-very good performances. But what you're really neck- deep in SUSPIRIA for is the style and the atmosphere, and Dario does not disappoint.If you've been jaded by one too many red-dyed Karo-syrup splatterfests, treat yourself to SUSPIRIA, one of the true ""originals."" Even if you've already seen it, but not in a while.",Suspiria
117,Vivekmaru45,Dario Argento's Greatest Horror Film To Date.,10,15 April 2010,"Suspiria is the greatest horror film and a true masterpiece made by Dario Argento. As a big horror movies fan, this is my favorite Argento film and it is much better than Phenomena, Inferno and Tenebre.With great special effects and a great background score by the Goblins.The film is about one of the three mothers (Witches) who is called Suspiria or 'the mother of sighs'. Susie Bannion (played by Jessica Harper) arrives at a ballet school in Germany to perfect herself. There she is welcomed by the school's directress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett). She befriends Sara (Stefania Casini) who tells her about a friend of hers who had vanished without trace and who believed that the school was actually a coven for witches and the only one who knew of a secret entrance to the coven. When Sara disappears mysteriously, Susie begins to investigate the rumour of The Black Queen who had previously been the owner of the school.This film is a must have for any horror fans film collection.",Suspiria
118,rainking_es,Argento is not for me.,3,7 April 2006,"This is the first Dario Argento's movie that I've watched (as far as I can remember). I chose ""Suspiria"" because it's one of the most famous movies from Argento, and one of the favorites of the Italian director's ""supporters"". Now, here's my verdict: Argento is nothing but another mediocre director who makes b-series movies with such hackneyed stories, bad actors and, of course, tons of macabre stuff.Witchcraft, gore, a soundtrack that gets on your nerves, and that aesthetic that's so ugly and looks so old fashioned.If you want my opinion I think that only those who unconditionally (and strangely) love this man will enjoy this kind of films.*My rate: 3/10",Suspiria

From the photography, to the framing of the images and the art direction, this film is stunning to look at. Even the actors are perfectly cast for their bizarre features that fit the role. It is as if Fellini had made a horror film. Raise the volume and you would be disappointed in what it has to offer. The only saving grace in the sound department is the soundtrack by, Zombie. You could label the music as a piece of industrial experimental horror music! The script itself is a convoluted muddled piece of childish gibberish nonsense. But don't let that get in the way of the spectacular visionary brilliance of Dario Agento and his crew.",Suspiria
120,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Strong start, great middle, weak finish",7,26 January 2007,"A young American woman, Suzy Bannion, enrolls at a prestigious European ballet school. She soon hears some frightening tales about the school and suspects that some of them may be true.The movie begins as a great horror film. The stylish brutal murder near the beginning is among the genre's best in terms of tension and execution. Pun not intended. The sets and atmosphere are also ripe and well used for a horror story in addition to the premise. There is great use of light and shadow that make some scenes really menacing. Those scenes also never go over the top into the buckets of gore that comes standard with many horror movies today. The instead rely on clever set design and the type of innovation that makes movies fun to watch.However, with all this set up and care to make a great horror film, it is a shame that it amounts to so little. The end can be summed up in two words and they are, sudden and disappointing. No clincher. No twist. Not even a cheesy sappy feel good end. The credits literally just start to roll. On the bright side that leaves you thinking about what could happen next, but with the film's careful setup they could have put a little more into that conclusion. --- 7/10Rated R for violence and horror",Suspiria
121,mario_c,That unforgettable little song,7,14 June 2009,"SUSPIRIA is a classic for sure. It's claimed to be a masterpiece. I agree that it's one of the best movies of the Italian director Dario Argento but it has the same kind of features I use to dislike in Argento's works: clichéd horror scenes and some bad acting. Nevertheless it's a movie that dwells in our mind for a long time. But what is really unforgettable in this movie – and certainly made the difference to turn it into a cult movie – is that sinister melodic little song, performed by ""The Goblin"", and the intensity of the red in some scenes, as it would signify a ""blood bath"" in a symbolic way. In fact it's this symbolism allied to some surreal scenarios that give a different and mystic atmosphere to SUSPIRIA. It has some scenes, especially in the beginning and at the end which are very well shot, with great camera details, nice lights (red mostly) and the sinister sounds I did refer, which combined create a fantastic surreal ambiance. About the horror scenes, especially the gore ones, I assume they were greatly done at the time, but I think they are too dated nowadays; and to a viewer that is used to the modern special effects I think they lose their original shocking impact Anyway, SUSPIRIA is generally considered as a cult movie, and I certainly agree with that!",Suspiria
122,AngelHonesty,What a weird movie,5,16 January 2021,"I was excited to watch the movie as it was highly recommended to me. I'm a big fan of older films and cheesy horror flicks, but I found this one disappointing. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I thought it would be much scarier. I read that the movie was originally written for a younger cast of children, if they would went through with it, the film would have been much scarier.The coloring is crazy bright for almost every scene that it's a little hard on the eyes. The set is extremely staged that it looks very fake. This is supposed to be about ballet dancers, but you never get to see any dancing. Everything is very confusing until it finally somewhat makes sense near the end. The acting is terrible in the film as they should have picked a better lead actress. Some parts of the movie should have been better explained as it leaves questions, such as the blind man. And that scene when the guy if lifting the lock??? Why on earth did it take so long? Overall, I loved the ending but it took awhile to get there.",Suspiria
123,tonypeacock-1,Italian Giallo delight for horror fans,8,7 August 2019,"Excellent example of an Italian giallo horror film from director Dario Argento. The film focuses on a German ballet school where strange and very gory happenings take place.It becomes apparent that the staff of the school are behind these events. Some of the characters look like extras off Prisoner: Cell Block H and there is a mute guy that is a ringer for the late Richard Kiel.This genre of film was made before slasher horror films bombarded Hollywood and it is just as effective. In particular this film uses vivid colours, gothic sets and a pounding musical score to add to the atmosphere. I would recommend this as an entry point to the Italian giallo genre.",Suspiria
124,RanchoTuVu,inspired,9,12 August 2010,"While the style in Suspiria was definitely heavily laid on, it's but one element among all of the others that make this film so memorable. Maybe only Dario Argento could make an airport look so menacing as the one in the opening of Suspiria, an airport in which there is no one around except star Jessica Harper, and from which she finally emerges into an incredible rainstorm and tries again and again to flag down a cab, which takes her to an out of the way, but weirdly prestigious dance academy, housed in a scary looking building from the outside and totally drenched in deep, rich color on the inside. Who better to recruit as future witches than attractive dancers. The taxi ride from the airport to the academy gets creepier by the minute and is reason enough to watch, especially when we see an ex-student who apparently did not meet the academy's requirements, in a creepy night time shot running through some woods in her white night gown while the rain pours down. What happens to her later goes down as an artistic masterpiece of sustained violence and color.",Suspiria

It's sad. The scariest thing about this movie is the second of the two songs that plays over and over in the movie. It's just plain creepy with it's repetitive thumping noises and brassy crescendo. The movie itself is dull, the coven plot, kinda boring, but it comes alive when that second song starts up and people start getting killed in the most eye-popping ways. Dario Argento is like Lucio Fulci with a sense of style. This is another one of those brightly colored and bloody foreign films that is merely an exorcise in style.",Suspiria

127,acidburn-10,An Acquired Taste but I loved it,10,7 May 2007,"The plot A cute American student (Harper) gets more than ballet slippers and tap dancing when she attends a reputed European ballet school to perfect her skills. To her dismay, folks around her start dropping like flies and she eventually uncovers a spooky coven of witches. I must say that Suspiria is defiantly an acquired taste and is probably one of the most weirdest movies I have ever seen. Written by the brilliant Dario Argento who've brought such classics as Demons to our lives comes up with this fairy tale gone bad but shot beautifully, it's definitely one of those movies you'll never forget and the reason why I say it's an acquired taste is that not everyone gets this movie, because it's different, like I watched this movie with some of my friends and they thought it was to artsy and made no sense, but I definitely gets it. Also to add to this movie is the bloody and gory kills which are creative and suspenseful, the opening scene in particular is one of the movie's highlights, extremely brutal and you can really feel the pain as does the barbed wire scene which made me cringe along the flesh ripping, a silt throat, a stab in the neck and lots of bright red blood. I also appreciated the artistic flavor that Argento injected into his human slaughter via a use of bright red blood that looked more like finger paint than plasma. It worked for me.I think that Suspiria has stood the test of time over the years and even by todays standards it's still haunting yet mesmerising with plot turns and a real sense of mystery, a strong female lead and scary ass witches. It seems a pity that these days none of the horror movies that come out has this sense of style they all seem to be about the directer just spending loads of dosh on special effects and actors instead off perfecting a good story line.Jessica Harper (Suzy) was brilliant as the lead displaying strengh and vulnerability that made her outstanding, Stephani Casini (Sara) did fine as the lovable ""friend"". Joan Bennet's (Madame Blanc) classy and somewhat cold presence gave the part the right type of feel. A young Udo Kier (Dr. Mandel) did OK with his small role. Alida Valli (Miss Tanner) gave a chilling performance.The directing and use of the colours clearly took my breath away and moved me and all the scenes such as the ""running in the woods while it's raining"" scene, the hallway ""magic spell scene"" scene, the ""red lighted curtain"" and of course the final scene were all classic a;ON with the haunting and moving music score.All in all just watch this movie it's a brilliant horror masterpiece which will hopefully will never get remade into some sub standard Hollywood tripe such as ""Psycho Remake"" and ""The Hitcher"" remake both were an insult to the memory of the original films. All that's left to say is that this movie's just simply brilliant and a true turning point in horror cinema and please nobody remake this masterpiece because that would be an insult.",Suspiria
128,eibon09,Amazing Colors with Intense Murders,10,22 March 2001,"Suspiria(1977) is given its cult status in the USA partialy due to the extreme usage of colors.  The colors in Suspiria(1977) gives it an artful flavor that makes the movie beautiful to watch.  Argento uses the colors of blue, green, red, and yellow in an unique manner.  The director uses the old technicolor technique that was in use during the 1950s.  This aspect gives the movie a fairy tale appearence.In the first 20 minutes, Dario Argento wanted to build up suspense and tension that was normally reserved for the climax of a film.  The main character and story are built up in good fashion.  The shoots of Suzy Bannion inside the taxi cab gives the viewer a feeling of claustrophobia and dread.  The image and music in the opening moments add high voltage suspense to the film's pounding intensity level.  The shots through the woods are fabulously done.The double murder sequence is one of the most bloody scenes in modern horror films.  It still retains its shock value after twenty four years. This one sequence makes any murder scene in a teen horror film today look tame. The only murder sequence from an Argento film to match this in its brutality is the arm removal scene in Tenebre(1982).  The murder of the first victim is extremely violent and yet stylishly filmed.Dario Argento owes his debt in making Suspiria to the early animations of Walt Disney and the art of Jean Cocteau.  The main source of influence is the Disney film of Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs.  The Snow White film would influence many Italian horror movie makers because of the impression it made on them as a child.  The story of Suspiria(1977) was to originally take place in a children's school.  This was changed because of the possible controversies this would cause in the film community of Italy.In filming the murder scenes, the director wanted to pump them with intense horror that wouldn't let up.  He wanted to create scenes of fear that would be carried by its gory visuals and ear pounding music.  The murder scenes in the motion picture are given their own personal style. On doing this film and these murder scenes, Argento has said(""Fear is a 370 degree centigrade body temperature.  With Suspiria I wanted 400 degrees"").  The murder sequences are one of the main things that make the film a gem of a horror movie.Suspiria(1977) adds some movie lore to witchcraft mythology.  The movie looks at the mythology of witches and witchcraft with keen interest.  Its one of the best films on the subject of witches.  Argento was fascinated by the subject of witches and used that fascination to make Suspiria(1977). Another source of influence is a section from the Thomas De Quincey's drug induced fantasy essay, Confessions of an Opium Eater called Suspiria De Profundis.Daria Nicolodi gives an important contribution in co writing the screenplay. Suspiria is the only film where Daria Nicolodi had creative imput on an Argento flick.  Part of the film was inspired by Nicolodi telling Argento about her Grandmother's experiences at a finishing school where black magic was practriced during the late hours of the night.  Daria Nicolodi was to play Sara, Suzy's friend but got injured during shooting.  The story is there to give structure to the visuals & music.The death of Daniel, the blind piano player is set up with suspense.  The scene takes an unexpected turn when he is attacked by his own dog.  This is because the scene at its opening points to him being killed by a witch. Dario Argento along with cameraman Luciano Tovoli uses complex camera movement to make this scene work.  This scene must have impressed Lucio Fulci when he saw the film that he would play homage to it in The Beyond(1981).There has been a great debate among Argento fans on whether Deep Red(1975) or Suspiria(1977) is the director's masterpiece.  Some see Suspiria(1977) as the masterpiece in the film cannon of Dario Argento.  Others regard Deep Red(1975) as his true masterpiece.  In my opinion, Tenebre(1982) is the masterpiece of Dario Argento because its complete in motifs that were seen in his films up to that point.  Deep Red(1975) and Suspiria(1977) are Argento's top horror films of the 1970s.I find it intriging that Suzy and Sara resemble sisters and have names that begin with the letter S.  Suspiria was influenced by an obscure horror pic called La Residencia/The Finishing School(1968).  Supiria contains a tinge of the giallo genre with a scene in the opening moments.  The Goblin gives out another amazing soundtrack following their excellent score for Profondo Rosso.  Luciano Tovoli does a fantastic job as the cinematographer in showcasing the nightmarish world of Suspiria(1977).",Suspiria
129,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,"Breath-taking, jaw-dropping chills",10,29 January 2007,"Typically I am not a fan of the occult or supernatural in movies. 'The Exorcist' and 'The Omen' made me titter and I'm really far too rational. The fact then that Argento makes Suspiria scary for me is a testament to his incredible genius. I do not use the latter word lightly. It is very rare that you see a truly cinematic masterpiece, as opposed to theatre on film. The art direction is simply unparalleled, I can't think of anything with as much visual wow factor from first viewing except maybe John Woo's 'Hardboiled'.This is truly a case of the master surpassing the pupil, Argento taking on Bava's style and transcending him. The colour photography and set design in this movie, makes 'Blood and Black Lace' (Bava - 1964) look like a novice's entry into the canon. I'm not typically a fan of Grand Guignol, 'Suspiria' is a different matter, the concept, atmosphere and camera-work in the murder scenes make for acutely affecting and terribly beautiful tragedy.I liked the mystery element of the story, which really makes Suspiria a kind of giallo crossover (did you work out what 'irises' meant before Suzy Bannion?). Argento utilizes the macguffin extremely well, and has learnt many lessons in suspense from Hitchcock (outdoing him in my opinion).The artwork to be found in the movie, from the Escher wallpaper (and several other wallpapers), to the mural in the dance academy, the stained glass skylight, makes almost every still from the movie worthy of reproduction. I certainly intend investing in artwork from this movie. One senses that Argento does over-egg to an extent, the buffoonish extras in the dance academy (Alida Valli hams it too much for one), the occasionally (only very occasionally) garish photography and over-the-top set design (I didn't like the staircase in the academy at all), come close to making the movie a folie de grandeur. However for the most part Argento's virtuosity is so extremely evident that the movie holds the audience rapt in its spell. If you aren't truly terrified by this movie... you haven't a pulse.Last but not least, the sound track by Goblin, in collaboration with Argento himself, is equalled in horror history only by that of Kubrick's 'The Shining'.",Suspiria

The story sucks. An American dancer goes to a European dance school, that is supposedly run by a witches cult. She knows there's problems there and when it is confirmed to her towards the end by an expert on the cult, she goes back to the school. Does that make sense? No. Then she ends up killing the witch. Great stuff? No.All the actors here suck. The dubbing is even worse. The dialogue is hard to sit through. We have scenes of maggots. What the hell is that? We have a girl falling into a room full of razor wire. Razer Wire. So, the dance school has stores razor wire.The cinematography was OK. Not great.The lighting is complete trash. It's like watching a cartoon. Incredibly Unnatural Colors. Maybe next time stay away from the disgusting color lights, blending unnatural reds with green. Congratulations, you know how to use color gels. It's like a cook who uses every single ingredient in the kitchen.The intro killing was decent. Probably should have shut it off after that.The killing of the piano player by his puppet blind dog was especially worthy. This animal was possessed by the witches and then miraculously turns into a puppet and bites the piano players neck until he dies. Very impressive, how the witches turn the real dog into a puppet. They should have elaborated on that trick. Maybe the whole movie should have been about the puppet dog. That's something.Music was OK, but nothing special like most reviewer claim.I have read most of the user and critic reviews of this ""film"". Most praise it, some are in the middle, and a very small minority hate it. I hate it. And I hate it even more because others love it and dismiss its faults, including its crappy story and acting. They say, forget about the story, forget about the acting, enjoy the atmosphere. Sorry, I can't do that. I don't know what drugs your taking, or what drugs you took that may have permanently destroyed your tastes in decent film making. But this human is still awake to the garbage that this film is.Current rating is 7.5 on IMDb. Good luck with that. This movie and all its participants, including its viewers including myself, suck.Now my rating as a stand alone film would be a D, or 3 stars, mostly for the intro. Because of all the praise from others, I will need to balance with an F, or 1 star. And I will recommend you watch this. It can be a personal social experiment. Let's see what you think.Since my viewing of this pile of dung ""Suspiria"", I have had the misfortune to watch more Argento garbage. ""Four Flies"" trash. ""Plumage"" trash. Argento is not a film maker. He is a promoter. He spent ½ a million dollars in 1970 to make Plumage. Do you know what kind of money that is today? I'm guessing most of it went for publicity. The money came from the bank of Dad. Amateur stories, acting, dialogue, cinematography, lighting, editing. I'd like to lump Bava into the same trash that Argento belongs in. Try to Fulci for some taste. Or Messiah of Evil, or White Zombie, or Footprints on the Moon. There's some substance and professional film making there.",Suspiria

133,Eumenides_0,Dario Argento's Horror Manual,7,29 April 2009,"A young woman travels to Germany to attend a famous ballet school. On the night she arrives, a student flees in the middle of a storm and then dies in the goriest, weirdest, most colorful (and also absurd) manner. It's an interesting start which encapsulates everything about the movie: logic goes out the window the moment the first victim goes too; the colors and art direction are just marvellous, everything is shot in hazy hues of red and green, reminding one of a dream; and the murders are all very elaborate and violent.Dario Argento is clearly not concerned with realism here; one can easily find a surrealist undercurrent in this movie. More importantly, he's truly devoted to the mechanics of horror. Up until the '70s horror movies used to be just movies, I guess, trying to uphold the same production values that dramas did. Just look at The Exorcist or Don't Look Now for examples.Argento is already a precursor of the cheap slasher genre which will dominate horror after the '70s. And yet he's one step above crap like Friday the 13th. I have a feeling Argento is more concerned with how to create suspense and induce fear than good dialogue or good acting. He knows how to set up a disturbing scene, and how to kill a person unpredictably: there's a murder of a blind man in this movie which just caught me by surprise by its simplicity. Not just that, he knows how to create a feeling of dread, of suggesting horrors around the corner or behind a horror. There's something masterful about his combination of sound, colors and camera movements that makes this movie strangely artistic.This neglect of characterization and story and emphasis on style end up making Suspiria a movie worth watching, especially for anyone interested in learning how to create horror. More than a movie, this is a manual.",Suspiria
134,LoneWolfAndCub,"Argento's best, scariest and most visually stunning film",10,16 September 2008,"After another viewing of what is considered Dario Argento's greatest film, I can honestly see why. Last week I finally got around to seeing his latest (and last in the ""Mothers"" series), Mother of Tears, and although it was still great, it did not have the same flair that Suspiria still has. Distinctly European, Suspiria opens as if it were a giallo (much like his previous films The Bird with the Crystal Plumage or Deep Red) - with a series of spectacular murders stages with an odd beauty. However, Argento switches from black-gloved human killers to supernatural forces and black magic. Unfortunately, American ballet student Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) has to discover this when she arrives in Germany to attend a prestigious dance academy.Suspiria carries with it many of Argento's trademarks, in particular, his relentless tracking shots are beautiful and often haunting. This is accompanied by long-time collaborators Goblin, who give us a chilling, almost overbearing score which suits the Gothic feel of the movie. The cinematography is typically amazing, with an abundance of birds-eye-view shots and views of large buildings. In particular, a scene where a blind pianist enters a large square surrounded by imposing buildings of neo-classical architectural style is scary as well as great to look at.Accompanying all this is a unique use of colours, especially bright red, green and blue. This use of lighting occurs at random and seemingly silly scenes, but in fact adds an enormous amount of atmosphere and gives a sense of mysticism to the story. On the story, for an Argento film it is quite good (to contradict what others have said). It may be simple, but it unfolds at an even and logical pace only to slightly falter with a rushed ending. Furthermore, the acting is nowhere near award worthy (except Harper, Udo Kier and Joan Bennett as a nasty witch) but in no way detracts from the quality. Lastly (but certainly not least) are the outrageous death scenes which have garnered a lot of attention. Primarily, the opening double murder sequence, in which a young girl is stabbed to death (exposing her heart) and proceeds to crash through a glass ceiling, which mutilates the her friend below her. Interestingly, there are only three more deaths in the film and they are spaced quite far apart. Of course, these are all explicit and involve a lot of blood.Suspiria stands out even among the best of its form for the sheer intensity of the experience of watching - and hearing - it. From beginning to end, this is a nightmarish, hallucinatory fairytale with grotesque murders, a blaring score and beautiful imagery. A true horror film and a huge achievement in cinema, Dario Argento's Suspiria is deserving of all its praise.5/5",Suspiria

Will she uncover the secret in time to save her life or will she die a grisly death? One of my favorite Argento films and an awesome Anchor Bay dvd this film is a good introduction to the new viewer of Dario Argento. The photography, with the use of bright lighting and gels is simply the best he has done. The Goblin score will take over your home theatre and your soul. The overall production value coupled with Argento's usual flair for inventive deaths thrown in with a good cast and a sense-shattering music score makes this a winner. 9/10",Suspiria
136,garethcrook,So much paint.,8,23 December 2019,"I'm not a horror aficionado, but right from the outset this hooked me. The colour, the music, the menace, it's fantastic, if not a little cheap in places. The opening scenes treated differently could feature in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, but this isn't campy schlock (although I do love Rocky Horror), it's much weirder, a psychedelic, kaleidoscopic, technicolor nightmare. Set in a German dance academy with a bunch of itchy ballet students and snooty tutors seems like an odd stage, but old Bavarian buildings filled with wooden floors, gothic arches, billowing curtains and heavy European accents against the innocent American lead fits the 1970s take on the supernatural rather well. Ultimately it feels more silly than scary, but it's style is it's savior as the boarding school facade slips to reveal its demonic reality. The music is as, if not more important than the cinematography and I believe there's a recent remake with score from Thom Yorke that I now have to check out. If he's done half as good a job it'll be a must listen/watch. Perhaps the remake will feature some slightly better fake blood... I don't think I've ever seen so much red paint in a 90 minute film.

Argento makes bold use of lighting, color, sound effects, and inventive cinematography to give this film a strange but one of a kind visual appeal. The films unique sets add to the odd unusual visuals as well. The story of the film is simple and the plot thin, but Italian films are all about style over substance and its Argento's flamboyant style that uplifts this film.Suspiria builds to extremely intense suspense at times and packs plenty of shocks along the way.The opening sequences feature one of the most terrifying murders in cinematic history! As with Argento's other films, and Italian horror in general, there is plenty of gore in this film. All the more adding to the frightening effect of the film is the awesome, but eerie score by the band Goblin. The Suspiria score is so original and wild that it is perhaps Goblin's best work!The cast is excellent as well. The charming Jessica Harper makes for a likable lead, her performance is pitch-perfect. Stefania Casini is good as a fellow student and friend to Harper. Alida Valli is great as a menacing teacher and Joan Bennett perfect as the school director.Suspiria is must-see horror for genre fans.

I'll add to the accolades of everyone else by agreeing that the music makes the film, much like the music makes Coppola's The Conversation. Why can't we get good movie music any more? It's all a barrage of overstuffed forgettable orchestral screaming. Anyway, the comparisons to The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby are inevitable, but where you could understand what was at stake in these two films (a small child in the first, a pregnant woman in the second), it's less clear in this film. Numerous references are made to money, so somehow the witches seem less scary when they're landlords demanding rent. Secondly, I'm left wondering why the witches went to all this trouble, what's in it for them? They run a ballet school, which is a front for...what? I don't get it. Yes it's a beautiful, stylish film, but the antagonists' motivations make no sense, their goal has to be believable, and I'm not seeing it.",Suspiria

If you are looking for a horror film for intellectuals, this isn't it, but if you want something that will definitely impress you, you've found it. It concerns an old dance company in Freiburg Germany that is headed up by an old witch matriarch who leads the coven in diabolical methods. An unsuspecting student, played wonderfully by Jessica Harper, finds herself piecing together a mystery when she arrives at the school in one of the most enigmatic and beautiful commencements of a film to date. Argento has music, colors, and sounds reverberate like an opera for our eyes to dazzle. He scares us with the rain, the closing of an automatic airport door, and loose tree branches that resemble evil lurking beings. This is one powerful moment. From then on, subtle hints are explored, the supernatural, science, one's faith. Never can we guess what is truly hiding at the academy. One scene of the dance students in the hall is superbly done with loud music, hideous heckling demonic shrieks and strange appearances, this is fantastic eye candy!",Suspiria

Giallo is a genre originating out of Italiy, part pulpy mystery, part fantastic horror and crime stories, part erotic thriller, and always ridiculous amounts of violence. The pulps, are ""yellow books"" basically, Gaillo means yellow in Italian, which for some reason was cheaper than white paper and used in a lot of pop novels and magazines at the time. This genre has been Dario Argento's modus operendi for nearly thirty years, and though for the most part, his filmography is full of really, not even amusingly, bad films, this is the one that made him famous enough to make people interested in all the others.For me it's the best, the bizarre and operatic soundtrack by ""The Goblins"" alone make it worthwhile viewing. The story is about a girl attending a haunted Ballet school in Germany, arriving the same day of a tragic and grisly murder, and uncovering the dark and ancient secret behind it all. A little slow at times, the story is a loose excuse to run wild with macabre ideas that don't need too much explanation. It's also the beginning of a trilogy continuing with Inferno (the less said the better), and ending with last years ""The Mother Of Tears"".Featuring a mix of slashers, killer dogs, witches, bats, and maggots, ""Suspiria"" is a horror funhouse and a masterpiece of genre, but a film mostly for fans and horror enthusiasts, those looking for a movie that's actually scary, might want to look elsewhere, those in for a wild operatic pulp horror have found their golden ticket.",Suspiria

And only then does the film properly begin, as beautiful young ballet students in a school run by evil witches are dispatched in ingeniously wicked ways - throats slashed or torn to pieces by razor wire.Rightly regarded as a baroque, over-the-top classic, and one of the most visually stunning, it's like being frightened to death in an art gallery.",Suspiria

She is there to attend ballet school at prestigious academy. The first bad sign, other than the raging storm, is that she sees a woman fleeing the school and a voice telling Suzy that she is not welcome. We soon see the fleeing student later being brutally murdered by a mysterious person (You see a pair of haunting eyes glowing through a window at her).Suzy eventually comes back and is welcomed by Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) the instructor, who has a very creepy smile on her face. Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett)seems insistent on Suzy boarding at the academy, even though Suzy doesn't want to. Later, Suzy collapses in class and ends up having to stay anyway, forced to drink wine and eat bland food. Her only friend Sarah (Stefania Casini)tells Suzy about the strange going ons there, including the staff (They supposedly leave the school, but Sarah realizes that they don't)Suzy also seems to be drugged a lot. We also find out that it was Sarah's friend that was fleeing the school and that Sarah herself was warning Suzy to stay away.Suzy soon finds out that the school is actually run by a coven of witches. And Suzy also finds out that she is next on the witches hit list.Argento does a good job with the film. The colors are incredibly vivid and the murders are pretty interesting (The first murder is just brutal). But it is the music that gives the film the real creeps.

146,SkullScreamerReturns,Atmospheric horror weirdness at its best,9,28 March 2021,"I don't get it when some people accuse Suspiria for being ""too artistic"". To me it doesn't feel pretentiously artistic at all. If we go that way I might as well blame ""The Shining"" instead for being a (rather good) art movie but not so much a real horror movie. Well, I like both, and to some extent they share a similar weird visual atmosphere. But if I had to choose from these two, I'd say Suspiria is my favorite and it has all the elements that I personally think make a horror movie great.Let's start with the negative aspects which aren't many. Compared to the majestic other aspects of the movie the graphic death scenes look a bit corny with the bright red blood. Yes, I guess that's Dario Argento's trademark style but I think he should have tried something different in this time because I think otherwise Suspiria is a more stylish film than Argento's usual ones (at least from what I've seen so far).Everything else is perfect. The otherworldly use of colors and lighting makes me wonder, why isn't this kind of style used in movies more often? It's so awesome! Then there's the weird music that adds to the atmosphere. I guess this is where the ""too artistic"" comments might be coming from? Yes the music is very experimental but I think it it suits nightmarish mood of this movie and I don't mind it as the background soundtrack. Though I must admit some other Argento movies have more memorable themes that I'd be more likely to listen from cd.The story itself is equally good to the visual style. I like the pace, how the thrill and mystery builds up. The ending is not maybe quite as perfect as the buildup but it's satisfying enough.Maybe not 100% perfect film if you are being critical...but it has so many things done so right that I just love it.",Suspiria

I saw it when I was 12 and thought it was stupid and boring. I just re-watched it and it's laughable HOW BAD it is. The story and the lines are ridiculous, the acting is awful, the super loud annoying music made my head hurt, and I had to keep raising the volume cause the girls are whispering so often, I could hardly make out what they were saying. And that horrible voice from the witch made me bust up laughing, it was so stupid!!
Other than my appreciation for architecture and the interior designs and long creepy hallways, I have NO IDEA why anyone likes this film or even thinks it's scary at all. There are So many better horror movies from the 70's. Like The Exorcist, The Shining, Alien, The Omen I & II, Carrie, The Other, Burnt Offerings, Salem's Lot, Halloween, Jaws, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Amityville Horror, The Hills Have Eyes and even campy Trilogy of Terror are all better made movies and actually scared me as a kid. And they still creep me out today. I couldn't believe they remade Suspiria in 2018 and It was as GOD AWFUL as the original, despite casting a few actresses I really like, it just plain SUCKED!!!

149,sunznc,Suspiria-can't take my eyes off of it.,9,24 November 2006,"This is one of those films you can't take your eyes off of. The film's sets, in a fancy dance school in Germany, are colorful, gaudy, ornate, detailed and slightly Gothic with dark colored walls and hand painted designs. Sheer curtains with gold and red appliqués create shadows and atmosphere. In contrast are the stark dance rooms where students practice ballet. But the film itself is glossy and vibrant and the opening murders slightly over-the-top. Because the primary actors speak in their native Italian language, the film is dubbed in English with the exception of the voices of Jessica Harper and Joan Bennet. This adds a very odd feel to the film so that it appears and feels very foreign. Basically, the school is run by a modern day coven of witches. The story is intensely played out to a background of techno music by The Goblins that makes one think of the opening sequences of ""The Hunger"". When certain students find out about ""the secret"" they are hunted down and killed brutally! If you are fan of mystery & horror films you will love this!!",Suspiria
150,skybrick736,Suspiria (9/10),9,30 July 2016,"Suspiria is a movie that proves filmmaking can be a work of art. Dario Argento used florescent colored walls in the dance schools walls and a vibrant light tone of red for kill scenes to make a really trippy setting. As Eli Roth once said in a horror documentary about Argento's Suspiria that ""he really puts the gore in gorgeous"". The filmmaking really illuminates the atmosphere of 970's nostalgia and a gritty European feel. Along with Argento's filmmaking, the writing and music are also exceptional. The band Goblin main theme at the start of the film is incredibly haunting full of devilish chants and light xylophone, bell type sounds. It really fits into the narrative of the ballet boarding school being terrorized by a supernatural killer. The story develops really well after the fast start with a terrifying climax. Suspiria has nearly infinite replay value and goes down as one of the better horror films in my book. An absolute must-watch!",Suspiria
151,Bogey Man,"Dario Argento's brilliant masterwork, the director's first effort in horror/fantasy genre after his giallo films",10,7 July 2002,"Dario Argento's greatest masterpiece among his many films is Suspiria from 1977. It is written by him and his future wife Daria Nicolodi, who knew/knows very much about witchery and black magic, and whose granny told her many stories and fairy tales when she was a child. Nicolodi got the idea for Suspiria when she remembered one real life incident what happened to her granny, who was a famous pianist; she once went to some music academy for audition and found out that also black magic was taught there and ran away immediately. Nicolodi has refused to tell the name of that academy for safety reasons (understandably), but she is sure that the story is true and bad things were going on in that academy.Suspiria's plot is similar: American ballet dancer Susy (Jessica Harper, chosen for the role when Argento noticed her in DePalma's Phantom of the Paradise) arrives in Germany to attend highly appreciated ballet school with professional and talented teachers. She finally arrives there on one rainy night, but faces horrible incident in her way to the school, as horrified girl runs out of the school in panic screaming something. Soon comes one of the most famous and incredible scenes of the film, and by that time, the film has delivered incredible amount of style, darkness and atmosphere, and it has run only 15 minutes or so. Susy finally gets to the school next day and gets to know the staff and her fellow students. Unfortunately for Susy, but fortunately for the lovers of Argento's art, the real nature of the school is soon revealed to Susy and we are going to see one of the most horrific journeys to the gates of Inferno ever. The magic has begun.The magic of cinematography - The film is hard to describe with words since it has so many elements and merits that deserve to be mentioned and analyzed. I'll begin with the visuality of the film. The camera work by the director Argento and director of photography Luciano Tovoli is uniquely brilliant as hard to shoot camera movements and wild angles give incredibly powerful and brightly original visual punch to the viewer's eyes. They used one special filming style and gels (uncommon at the time) to create the unbelievable color world, that bloom also in Argento's another masterpiece and sort of sequel to Suspiria, Inferno. Suspiria's photography is mainly about colors, and also from long distance shots to extreme close ups, which are at their most brilliant in the guard dog scene at night. Tovoli said this particular scene was very difficult to shoot as it was night time and the lightning was hard to create. The colors and cinematography are one of the most important elements in Suspiria, and I think Argento's and Tovoli's co-operation in this film is among the strongest collaborations ever in the field and history of horror cinema.The magic of music - As important element as the photography in this film is, is Claudio Simonetti's and his music band Goblin's soundtracks and world created by music. It consists of different sounds like whispers, different and exotic instruments and of course the unique and immortal theme that starts in the very beginning of the credits and leaves the viewer only when the final frame of this unforgettable horror opera is rolled away. I can't mention any other horror movie that has an equally incredible use of music and an ability to create an equal feeling of horror and fear with the power of images and music. Suspiria demands to be seen and heard in big screen, but it is still very powerful experience in home and from video, too. Suspiria's soundtrack is the proof that Goblin is one incredible rock group and Suspiria's music is one of their greatest achievements, as they have admitted themselves, too. Fear has never been described this effectively before and after Suspiria, and Goblin is as important maker here as the director himself, and Dario himself appreciates music very much and always participates in the composing of his films' music. All the Goblin soundtracks are very great as they have composed atmospheric and immortal music for films like Profondo Rosso (Argento), Dawn of the Dead (George Romero) and Contaminazione (Luigi Cozzi); their music has no comparison in other horror film composers and since music is so important element in cinema, Goblin is among the most important pieces of history of this genre.The magic of details and scenes, very often dealing with water and colors - I have one particular segment in this film that is the one that sense-shocked me the most and stayed in my mind forever, and so is above all the other segments and pieces of cinematic power of this film. In the beginning when Susy arrives in Germany, the rain and water is captured so stunningly that it is impossible to make full justice with words. The zooms to flushing rapids/water falls and swallowing street drain are the kind of elements that make films like David Lynch's Lost Highway, Eraserhead and Takashi Miike's Audition so powerful: the things that are not scary or threatening by themselves have been made very ominous and alive with the tools of cinema. The water in this beginning of Suspiria is among the greatest elements in the whole film, and the fact is that these details won't be revealed fully when first seen, as I noticed these incredible moments fully when I watched the film for a second time. Later on there is another little detail depicting water as it flushes down the drain when Susy is in her room. Water, colors and both together are the details Argento uses as greatly as possible and Suspiria shows this more powerfully than Inferno, which also has brilliant colors and water. The film is full of details, that almost all deal with colors someway, and this is the kind of cinema that can be and must be seen over and over again and it gives something new always and never becomes ""seen"" completely.The magic of atmospheric and beautiful, yet very hellish terror - There are horror scenes in Suspiria, that simply will haunt the viewer days and years after, and the most gruesomely effective scene is the maggot scene. Maggots and worms.. They are often depicted as the lowest form of life and so it is understandable they're used in here as an element of total terror and forthcoming opening of the gates of Hell, and the scene of maggot filled attic and old coffin stayed in my mind almost as powerfully as the mentioned water usage in the beginning of the film. The maggots are far more threatening than in Lucio Fulci's Paura Nella Citta dei Morti Viventi, a otherwise great horror film which has also a scene involving huge amount of maggots. The faces of characters are very important here as Argento uses very much a close ups of faces and face expressions. Jessica Harper does great acting since she is the focus in most of the scenes, and her face is full of innocence and childlike undisturbedness throughout the film, and she never shows signs of nervousness or other things connected to bad acting. But the most memorable faces are the ones that depict the forthcoming horror. The mysterious servant Pavlos and the mother and son are among the characters of evil that haunt throughout the film and as they keep silent all the time, it becomes far more disturbing. The scene where Susy is blinded by shining piece of glass by the mother/son duo, is again among the most memorable pieces of the film.The magic of all the aforementioned magic put together - Suspiria is perhaps the greatest Italian horror film, and is in my opinion ever greater than Mario Bava's often hailed masterpiece La Maschera del Demonio. Still these both films are masterpieces and I don't feel a need to compare them in any way. Suspiria's power lies in its music and visuality, so if I had to mention three most important characters that have created Suspiria this wonderful, I'd say Argento, Tovoli and Simonetti. Daria Nicolodi is also important as she gave her knowledge to the screenplay, but still I'd mention those three without leaving anyone out. The scenes of violence are horrific, but very aesthetic and never gratuitous or unnecessarily explicit. The opening double murder is among the most fierce murder scenes ever filmed and it wouldn't be as near as powerful without the Goblin music. The violence in Suspiria is perhaps little more symbolic and un-graphic than in Argento's other films, but since the power of Argento's films doesn't lie in gore, I cannot and don't want to concentrate too much on the violence as his films have their real merits elsewhere; violence is only one element that is handled and depicted with the power and magic of his most personal and unique styles and cinematic brilliance.People and so called horror fans tend to complain about plots in Argento films and they think always that plot is too thin or confusing or something like that. I really can't believe and understand those ""opinions"" since very often those people really don't find the real merits from Argento's films, the things Argento shows by using the plot only as a skeleton to be filled with the power of his art. If you are looking for great plot and entertaining twists and turns, forget Argento and please never judge his films without finding the real merits of them.Suspiria would be my choice among all the movies, if I had a possibility to choose one film that I would see in a movie theatre on big screen. This far, this is Argento's movie that suffers the most on television, being still very powerful and stunning experience when viewed on video. Suspiria is for horror genre what Gattaca by Andrew Niccol is for science fiction: totally unique masterpiece of the genre and a film that is too often neglected or judged by wrong reasons. Suspiria is 10 out of 10 bright stars immortal classic and Argento has already earned his place in the history of cinema, alongside many other great masters in different genres, horror or non-horror.""Magic is everywhere, all over the world."" -Suspiria, 1977",Suspiria

The story is more than adequate for the type of film this is, but it's really not needed due to the barrage of images that assault the viewer. The excellent use of colour and Argento's brilliant camera work are the main reasons why the visuals work so well, but it's the lesser known stuff - like the distinctly witch-shaped shadows during the dog attack sequence - that really makes the film work.

Also kind of sick.

But Argento's stuff is interesting and different in that it is CLASSY - both in setting and technique - so the chaos is tensing against something and has a very ill-defined aura of subversion. Also the music (also by Argento) is just WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM the whole time, I've never heard such extremity on a soundtrack before, and it's very effective. Sometimes you're like, WTF?

This is the first great horror film I ever saw.My original viewing took place back in 1994, where, as a young lad on the path to a world full of glorious gore and brilliant giallo, I stumbled upon the world of a director named Dario Argento. I snagged an issue of FANGORIA from a local bookstore and I was fascinated by the images shown in pictorial form in that magazine. I got pumped up. I searched for this movie, the most famous of Dario's films, and I was able to find an old copy on VHS. This was before it was released in any good form on DVD.I remember the first time I watched it being completely shocked by the first murder scene, where the girl is hung. Then, the camera pans down to the floor where another one was struck by falling glass through the mouth...I was hooked.The colors and the splendor with which Argento paints the picture that is the setting of ""Suspiria"" should be on every painter's palette. The way he uses lights is amazing, especially for the time of ""Suspiria's"" release.To call him the 'Italian Hitchcock' is a little misleading; Argento brings something totally different to the table than Alfred ever did: he updated the shock factor. And, unlike so many disgusting films that come out nowadays, he managed to keep it beautiful at the same time. ""Suspiria"" is the perfect introduction to this legendary horror director. If you're anything like me, you will crave more. And more. 10 out of 10, kids.",Suspiria
156,jhpstrydom,A stylish late 70's horror movie.,8,3 September 2012,"Given that lately Hollywood have been pushing out a lot of crappy horror movies I've been looking for a lot of old horror movies, mainly to try and find films the weren't part of either the Friday THE 13TH or HALLOWEEN franchises because when discussions normally start among me and my friends about 80's horror the aforementioned two titles are pretty much all they talk about or at least if it wasn't part of a franchise they didn't know about it.Among many of the old films I've never heard about from the 80's I found a few really great films which made me wonder why they went unnoticed and the Friday THE 13TH films were so big and I thought they were crap, although SUSPIRIA came out in the late 70's I put it among the great old films I've seen, the cinematography is excellent, the use of colors certainly gives the film a sort of edge, its almost like watching someone's nightmare unfold in front of you, the score manages to create tension whenever it plays and the main theme is really catchy, It took me a while to get a certain tune out of my head and the best part about this film is it barely shows its age the only thing that reveals its age are the gore effects that look a little fake but they're not too badly done, the other telling factor is the dubbing that's not so well done but it didn't get on my nerves like it could've.Overall, SUSPIRIA is actually very good, the cinematography is great, the score does work well to help set the mood and create tension but the only mistake you can make while watching this film is to try and compare it to horror films today which with all their fancy effects still manage to suck, the best way to watch this film is to be a little open minded and remember this wasn't brought out today it came out in 1977 so obviously if you start running comparisons you're only ruining the film for yourself as many of the newer comments on its IMDb web page does indicate those people have made that mistake mainly because they complain about the effects and everyone knows this film was directed by Dario Argento and many people have told me his work is an acquired taste but given that I've seen eight of his films so far I have no complaints.",Suspiria
157,MovieGuy01,Very good Dario Argento horror....,6,14 October 2009,"I thought that Suspiria was a very god horror film by Dario Argento. A young American dancer travels to Europe to join a famous ballet school. As she arrives at the ballet, the camera turns to another young woman, who appears to be running from the school. She returns to her apartment where she is gruesomely murdered by a horrible creature. Meanwhile, the young American is trying to settle in at the ballet school, but hears strange noises and is troubled by bizarre occurrences. She eventually discovers that the school is actually of a coven of witches. This film had a great atmosphere about it,and a real psychological feel to it which made it a very good film.",Suspiria
158,jmbwithcats,"Suzy, like Alice has fallen down a very dark hole into a wonderland of witches.",5,8 November 2005,"Suspiria is a movie I had heard about now and again over the course of many years, first from my oldest brother or overhearing a conversation my brother's friends had many years ago in the late 70s.The film came out when I was just five years old and all I could gleam at the time was a near comic book mystery, a profound imagery that wild and surreal fantasy that a child creates.Upon finally watching the movie I knew immediately I would have to write a review for the website.Suspiria is a movie based around an old Dance Academy that is run by a darkly magical coven of witches. Suspiria immediately sets a scene and puts one in the story with a genius one rarely sees in film these days if ever. It is a lost art contained in the works of Hitchcock, Argento, Kurosawa, Tsuruta, and few other brilliant and rare directors whose memory lives on in their films. One gets an overall feel from the film that is reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe.Suspiria is a terrifically magical film because it takes risks that you will never see in movies in today's desensitized age. It does not try to spell things out for you. In this way it's a mystery unfolding, a subtle, intelligent madness of color and sound and ideas.We are drawn deeper into the plot. It's not about the ending, it's about the journey.Incidentally, I love how all the rooms are painted with Escher designs. The walls around the staircase appear papered in a Curelean blue of crushed velvet, hallways draped in red embroidered silk.Suspiria unfolds as the imagination comes tumbling off the screen with all the color and music and emotion of a good book.You never see this kind of attention given to a film anymore, this amount of passion for the art of film coupled with so much skill. It's slow at times, but it's this careful manipulation of vantage and timing that makes the movie so brilliant.One feels the water, feels the mouth breathe words, feels the terrible events unfold each moment. Films like these aren't made anymore but should be studied closely, and savored.Though not particularly a scary film Suspiria is a work of art and makes you feel like you are in the shoes of the lead character, taking the journey with her in this macabre and haunting tale in a world that is all Argento.",Suspiria
159,valis1949,"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered",8,23 January 2011,"SUSPIRIA is a superior 70's kitsch horror film, and a splendid example of how the innovative use of dramatic lighting and mind-boggling set design can elevate a low budget feature into something which approaches Art. The plot is about as hackneyed as you could possibly imagine, but this film is not about a storyline. Just shut down the critical part of your brain, and let your eyes take over. In addition, the soundtrack is by an ensemble known as ""Goblin"", and this musical score perfectly enhances and sublimely compliments the cheesy production values. Two degrees more, and this film would have stumbled into parody, but SUSPIRIA remains a truly one- of- a-kind film.",Suspiria
160,flicklover,A stunning visual masterpiece of horror....,10,5 July 2021,"Suspiria is a film that I discovered some years ago as I got into the horror genre. It was on many top 10 horror lists and is considered by many to be best Italian horror movie ever.The story of Suspiria is very simple and you can even say kind of insignificant. An American young woman named Suzy Bannion arrives in Germany to attend a ballet school. From the beginning she knows something isn't right. When she arrives at the ballet academy she sees a student flee the school in terror. The student named Pat later is violently murdered in one of the most shocking but beautiful scenes I have ever seen in a horror film. If it seems that this film is disjointed and illogical is that it in my opinion is that this film is a nightmare, it doesn't take place in reality. Suzy us told there is something wrong at the school. The events tgat happen range from supernatural events to Giallo style murders. Once Suzy is in the school the headmistress of the school named m
Madame Blanc takes interest in her. There is an otherworldly evil force in the academy and Suzy is trying to solve a mystery. Again, the film has no real logic to.it. The characters are others developed. We see characters and later they disappear reinforcing the idea that Suspiria is a nightmare on film. The color palet is incredibly saturated. Red is tge color tgat most dominated the screen. But blues and greens are present also. There was such detail put into the look of this film it feels like I was watching a live action painting. There is really no logic in this film like a nightmare. To describe in traditional terms is difficult because there is so much going on the screen that that I didn't care. The film as many Italian horror films in the 70's and 80's are even badly dubbed. I read that the dialogue wasn't even recorded on set and every line of dialogue was done in ADR post production. I think that even the out of place and even badly timed dubbing adds to the film's dreamlike quality.This is a unique horror experience.A masterpiece.Grade: Ayoung woman named Suzy arri.",Suspiria
161,Jacques98,Why did I sit through that?,2,5 September 2008,"Suspiria tries hard to be a mature children's moviealong the same lines as Pan's Labyrinth and Halloweenand it fails. The reason it fails may be due to its age, but I doubt it. In 1970 films like Alien created doom atmosphere in the most believable way with no cheese, and simply make this movie look like a student film by comparison. No, the reason it fails at being a children's fairytale done wrong is because it tries so hard to be mature by creating suspense that it just creates boring, predictable, and sloppily executed.The movie opens with the first murder, and I simply cannot think of a more amateur, sloppy way for it to have taken place. It's more reminiscent of a cheese parody than a horror movie. It actually had me chuckling. Once again, I can't blame this on the era it was made because other movies in that same era nailed death scenes better than any modern movie could hope to do: the cheese is from poor ideas and poor film making. If this is Dario Argento at his best, what is his worst? An episode of Sesame Street? I'm worry, I can sometimes excuse an old movie of cheese, but I can't get over the fact this was made after Alien. Dario Argento should have known better, and he could have done better, but he didn't, thus I'm not going to look past the fact the murder scenes were so poorly done I couldn't hold back laughing.As far as gore goes, there is so little I don't even find it worth mentioning. So I won't. Just know that most of the stab wounds don't even show blood, and the blood that is in this film looks more like clown paint than plasma.But by far the biggest flaw of the film is the lack of any cohesive storytelling whatsoever. One scene will be an over-the-top (but not graphic or violent) murder scene, the next will be a ballerina scene that adds nothing to the movie, and the next will be some teachers talking about nothing that has anything to do with the movie. There is no order. At least 50 minutes of the runtime are completely pointless to the rest of the movieand this is supposed to be scary? These scenes don't build suspense or character, they just build boredom.In the end when all the mysteries are explained it was almost like a cute, trite, cliché slap in the face. The explanation for everything going on has been done so many times in horror movies I honestly would have liked the movie better if it cut off and ended right before explaining it all. I don't understand how something that is supposed to be a ""work of art"" is as unoriginal or sloppily done as this. If this is a work of art, the entire film is nothing but a poorly drawn stick person drawn with bright colored Crayons.The only sole good thing I can say about this movie is that the soundtrack is great. That is all.I'll never understand why so many people seem to think that if something is old, it has to be good, and if something is new it has to be bad. Also, especially with the horror crowd: if something is indie or foreign it is good, if it's American it's bad. This film the perfect example of why that thinking is wrong. Especially when the American, 1970's Alien came out in the same era. There is no reason for Suspiria to be as bad as it is, and I cannot excuse its faults because it's old.All I can say is what I said in the beginning: Dario Argento should have, could have, and probably does know better than he put into this movie.2/10.",Suspiria

163,geminiredblue,A Tale Most Haunting,9,13 October 2011,"The great Italian horror director Dario Argento made a name for himself by making some of the wildest, unhinged movies. And though he was making movies before this one, SUSPIRIA put him on the map. From the opening black screen and the eerie soundtrack provided by the Goblins, you're guaranteed to be frightened in new and disturbing ways. The wonderfully bizarre lighting, color scheme and cinematography all combine to unsettle the viewer. The story: A young American ballerina comes to Germany to take classes at a prestigious ballet academy. But soon after she arrives on a stormy night, a girl warns her to leave and then runs off into the rain. Moments later, in the most memorable death scene, the girl is attacked and killed by something before another girl, her friend, dies as a result of falling glass. From there madness ensues, for you see the academy is run by a coven of witches and headed by the Black Queen an ancient, evil, uber-powerful witch. Each death scene is elaborate and shocking. Along the way, there are so many notable set pieces and scenes. But don't worry, I wouldn't think of revealing them all! Experiencing them firsthand, like a really bad nightmare, is the best way to enjoy the thrills and chills. The overall atmosphere feels like a dark fairytale, and that's what makes it so terrifying. This film sticks in your mind and comes back to scare you well after viewing it. For you, gentle viewer, I highly advise this if you truly want a tale most haunting!",Suspiria

Luckily it came out on Mubi so I cracked open a bottle of wine and settled down to watch, not having a clue what it was about. Having sat through it, I'm not sure I'm any the wiser! It reminded me of the recent Nicholas Cage movie Mandy with its psychedelic sound, imagery and beautiful colour. Interestingly, at the start of Mandy there is a long still of an old video shelf. One of the many videos was none other than Suspria, so you can see why there may be similarities. I loved Suspria. I found it utterly bonkers and with a headache inducing plot, but compelling viewing.

165,noahgibbobaker,Surprisingly disappointing,5,13 October 2020,"I wasn't expecting Suspiria to be great but I didn't expect it to be bad. Almost everything about Suspiria is either really dumb or kind of dumb.There are some good things, like the cinematography is great. Each shot is very colourful and looks great, but the shot composition is really quite awful. The music is also really good and fits most scenes pretty well. There is one that the music is awful in though. The music changes drastically three times in the span of about 2 minutes, the film feels so uncertain about what tone it is going for.The single biggest problem with this movie is the writing. I can not stand some of the dialogue and exposition is given really poorly. Scenes also just end, I don't know if this is down to the screenplay or the editing so I'm going to blame both. Scenes just stop without any reason other than to movie the story on, the writer's either didn't bother to write the tail end of most scenes or the editor just cut it out. It's genuinely hard for me to comprehend that either of these would happen.Another huge problem is the acting, I feel the actresses didn't have much to work with but they are all really bad. Some of line delivery was really but, but that is definitely because not all the actresses and actors spoke the same language so they all just speak their native tongue and dubbed it in post. It really ruins some of the scenes for me, it was very distracting. I wasn't going to mention this because of the situation everyone working on suspira were put in. I decided I should though because it did really annoying me and will put others off as well.I would recommend suspiria to people who enjoy style of substance, the plot is pretty dumb but it looks great and sounds great do you decide if you want to watch it or not.",Suspiria

167,revival05,Essential art,9,30 September 2007,"So the other night I turned down the lights once again, and saluted the fall with a bottle of Italian red wine, some Italian almond biscuits and a DVD of SUSPIRIA; in Widescreen, in Surround and (in this case) in Italian! With me was my girlfriend who had not seen the film, and once more I witnessed the full power of this magnificent horror film through new eyes.I don't know how many times I've seen Suspiria over the ages, but it never fades in strength. It's one of the most intense films ever made and every time you put it on, lightning strikes. Now, Suspiria being an incredible feast for the senses is one thing, but every time I see this film it grows on me. Not only is this one of the greatest horror films ever (if one wishes to argue THE best, I would not disagree, it's certainly not a bad pick) but it is indeed also a bold and thoroughly conceived film, that - unlike many films, in particular horror films - has to be conceptually understood. I am a big fan of accepting films on their own rules. To me, there are no grounds in film, in the end film has got to be art, and no film can be expected to achieve a certain ""standard"". Film has existed for little more than one hundred years, and I guess this is why film has not yet broken through it's primitive state, as say, the novel did during the Modernist days. Don't get me wrong, I like a good popcorn film any day, and I hold no grudges towards Aristotelean storytelling - I just don't like it as a norm. Still today, priority one of film is ""entertainment"" and a film that doesn't pay enough attention to ""story mechanisms"", will be automatically perceived as more or less ""pretentious"" or, at best, ""conceptual"" or perhaps ""arty"".Now, why this long essay on the situation of art within film? Because, Suspiria is a prime example of a artistically ""free"" film. As much as we horror fans love it, many people still have a hard time with it - it has been said by many: the actors aren't good enough, the story is ludicrously thin, the dialog is cheesy... and the greatness of Suspiria is that this is exactly the point. You could argue: One cannot claim Suspiria being bad, by saying that it is incoherent. It's like saying Schindler's List is bad because it's about WWII. Dario Argento is not interested in the common so called rules of cinema. Like many other European directors before him, the actors are mere ""models"", so are the characters. There is no psychology, no intrigue. We basically never get to know anything about anyone, in the beginning of the film Suzy Bannion is at the airport and she has no identity, in the film she is not given a background, nor a future. The characters speak to each other, but apart from things leading the story along, it's about nothing. It is what's going on around them, and in between them, that matters. It is in the colors, the music, the violence, the imagery, in one word: Art. It means nothing or anything, judging on the viewer. It's essential art. This also sets Argento apart from many other Artistic directors (Bresson, Godard...) because unlike their films, Argento's films there are no concepts being followed. Just imagery.Personally, I think Suspiria is one big nightmare. It seems to be the real world, but it really isn't. When Jessica Harper arrives in the airport we are still in the real world. But the realm of Suspiria is lurking behind the doors of the main entrance, apparent with the demonic hisses from the Goblin soundtrack every time the doors are in frame, and the silence when we see Harper move towards them. And when she finally reaches the main doors, she enters the world of Suspiria. A world where people are talking in stiff articulations and where you cannot count on anything being quite the same as it is in the real world. For instance, if you turn out the lights there won't be darkness, but a tone of green or red.Despite it's enormous depth and width in imagery, Suspiria is a very concentrated film (compare it for instance with the followup INFERNO, no less interesting but a total demolition of any kind of coherent storytelling). I am not going to deny that the amazing Goblin score does very much for the film, and it is the element of music that truly makes it masterful. In the pounds, the howls and in the dangerously simple blood red theme, lies the true horror engine: Adrenaline. It's impossible not to become disoriented and instinctively scared by it. Added to that, the extreme use of diverse colors, perfect editing and basic Argentoish geniousness, we have a nearly flawless execution of a nearly perfect horror film.But not only that. When film has reached a place that it deserves, we will look back on Suspiria as a role model in modern film making, way ahead of it's time.",Suspiria
168,Rindiana,Never Fall into a Room Full of Barbwire! It Hurts!,3,18 June 2009,"What's considered as Argento's ultimate masterpiece by his admirers turns out to be just what all of his pubescent and exploitative schlock movies are: a succession of more or less well-handled gruesome killings with only the barest necessities of storytelling to link them. Acting, dialogue, narrative: it's all quite intolerable.But this time, even Argento's few strengths have mostly deserted him: the whodunit puzzling of his giallo plots - as stupid as they are - is sorely missed, the murders are boring (except for one doggy moment) and the finale is a howler.On the plus side, there's great location atmosphere, some nice shots, lots of Technicolor window-dressing and another effective Goblin soundtrack.3 out of 10 experts on witchcraft who bear a striking resemblance to Pepe Nietnagel's Dr. Knörz",Suspiria

170,ryan-10075,"Gorgeous, Scary and Innovative",8,18 December 2020,"I have a rabid horror movie watcher since I was about 11. Sadly, I never really got into the Italian horror films until I was in my 20s. There are quite a few different directors who got into the genre, but perhaps my favourite of the group is Dario Argento. When I was younger I believe the only Argento film I had seen was PHENOMENA and I really enjoyed it, but I had also seen the chopped up version running around 83 minutes, so everything did not add up. When I got around to watching this film I was quite quickly astounded by Argento's directing style and his amazing use of colours. Not to mention a spellbinding soundtrack from Goblin, which almost plays a character in the film.The first 15 minutes in the film are really amazing as we are introduced to the main character Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) who is joining Taz Dance Akademie. Upon arriving she sees another student Pat Hingle (Eva Axen) leaving the school in terror, shouting at someone inside while the heavy rain pelts down outside. She ends up going missing and Suzy soon learns there are some mysterious happenings at the school she is attending.Simply visually arresting and if there was someone who had never seen an Italian horror film and wished to do so, this would be a great option to go to.I saw this film on the big screen in Toronto while Claudio Simonetti (one of the members of Goblin) played the music with a band. It was simply amazing and really a highlight of my movie watching experiences. One of Argento's best and would put in his top 3 of all-time. Written by Argento and his partner at the time Daria Nicolodi. Also starring Joan Bennett and Udo Kier. Followed by a remake made in 2018.",Suspiria
171,TheVictoriousV,"(ARCHIVE REVIEW) So visceral, so Argento",9,25 February 2020,"Films today which fancy atmospheric reds and vibrant neon aesthetics (the works of Refn, the works of Noé, Mandy, that Swedish masterpiece Death Academy...) owe much to Italian auteur Dario Argento. At least when it comes to the former - the latter stems more from the 80's nostalgia we all seem to feel today, as well as the inception of color-coded ""bisexual lighting"" (the Line of Purples, simply put, fascinates our human eyes more and more as film technology moves onward). Even the bloodred throne room of Supreme Leader Snoke has yielded comparisons to Argento's set design.The following review is of Suspiria, the groundbreaking 1977 original by Argento and not the remake. I may review that too, if time these days will allow it. Either way, the remake is the reason I watched the first movie, which has been unmoved on my watchlist up until this point.One of the final films to be done in Technicolor, its intense colors and visual completeness are what make the experience. Its true horror lies in the fact that it plays like an inescapable hallucination and not so much in how it makes us feel for characters before their bloody demise. That said, there is a story at the center of it all.Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), an American ballet student, goes to attend the off-putting Tanz Dance Academy in Freiburg, Germany, each room and hallway looking like a surreal painting or the setting of a pyschadelic fantasy. Suzy learns quickly that this is no ordinary dancing school and that unnatural things happen behind the walls. Perhaps even, dare I say, witchcraft?Harper carries the film beautifully, despite not having moved on to anything noteworthy. Sources tell me, however, that she may turn up in the remake. But then, what do sources know?The characters Suzy meets are unusual and memorable, be they school faculty or fellow students of hers. If you take issue with the acting of those who portray them, I wouldn't necessarily hold it against you.The performances of Argento's films occasionally strike me as stilted, even awkward at certain points (the insistence among Italian filmmakers of the time to always dub the actors in post, since not all of them spoke the same language during shooting, doesn't help). I suppose the movie being heavy on style makes this excusable; the point is in the aesthetically creative presentation of these death scenes and not in believable emotional/physical responses from, say, the murderee.The distinctive style makes the action horrific all the same and the characters maintain a certain outlandishness that always suits the mood. Not even the fake-looking blood seems out-of-place or like a goof.You may find this movie to be lacking in terms of substance in general, even knowing that style was its primary selling point. As much as I rail against remakes and the apparent laziness of refusing to create new properties when manipulating people's nostalgia is more lucrative, this is a case where some improvements could debatably be made and a greater emotional connection could be created. Will the remake do this, or will it pull a Beauty and the Beast by making unnecessary/detrimental changes and keep enough to make it predictable?If the remake does make such ""improvements"", however, it might not be nearly as memorable an experience. And if it doesn't, there is still only one true Suspiria. It is visually perfected, magnificently scored, and thoroughly dreamlike.",Suspiria
172,Gresh854,Slasher Horror Done In An Unexpectedly Refreshing Fashion,8,21 July 2018,"In anticipation for Luca Guadagnino's remake of Suspiria, I decided to watch the 1977 original for the first time. Suspiria is slasher horror done right, because it's always molded around in mystery that entices you with a well-constructed lore rather than just faulting you in some typical, random, psycho-killer story. Of course, I can't go without mentioning the scenery and overall build of the film's setting/set pieces. It's all just the damn near definition of ""perfection."" Not only is this probably the most visually magnificent horror movie ever made but it also might just be the best scored horror film of all-time (I'd have to think about it). The score alone is an absolute masterpiece that makes most movie soundtracks look like amateur-work. I have but one major flaw with the movie which is the fact that there's a near 5-minute scene dedicated to a truck-load of exposition that feels heavily forced. Other than that, Supiria certainly lived up to the hype, and as a well-rounded horror fan, I can recommend this movie to just about any respectable horror junkie, any film-lover who is into artsy pictures, and undoubtly to any neo-art finatic.

She wants to dance a perfect ballet. But when she arrives... the things start to see bad. Our girl, Suzy, stays. Will she pick the right decision? ... I don't think so.This awesome masterwork for the genre and the movies by Dario Argento is really unforgettable and scary.

175,lthseldy1,really creepy film,7,5 November 2004,"This is one of Argento's most creepiest films. I remember watching the commercials for this film in the movie theater with the skeleton combing her hair and turning around and jumped out of my seat as a kid. What comes across during this film is Suzy gets involved in an almost Alice in Wonderland like surrounding involving witchcraft and murder in which the people that are running the place are involved in. There were a few disappointments though in the movie and one of them being the fake special effects in the film like blood looking to much like blood from a paint can and the fact that we didn't actually see the killer killing the victims, there was just a hand coming from behind the shadows and the corners doing all this killing. The killers are obvious in the movie sense we don't see to many ""nice"" people introduced in the film, their characters were stiff and to the point and it gave it away as to what their intentions were for Suzy to be rid of. But this is a vary good movie and vary creepy as it plays along the characters and the music in this film makes it even more creepy.",Suspiria
176,jp281995,Creepy and scary,9,16 November 2018,"I knew about this movie before, but never intended to watch it until now, when I found out there's a remake. The movie is about an American dancer who enrolls in a ballet school in Germany and, unknown to her, sinister ""monsters"" lurk within the walls of the school.Suspiria is one of the most clever and inventive horror films there is. It is original, especially the set design and score. The killing scenes are very tense, most especially the American girl's roommate's murder and also that one where the maggots fell from the ceiling. The climax is also really scary and creepy.I recommend this classic.",Suspiria
177,freaky_dave,Disturbing movie and one really nasty death scene,7,9 November 2010,"I noticed that Suspiria is listed on a lot of horror movies top lists so I decided to buy it. I wasn't disappointed.For a horror movie coming from 1977, Suspiria is a rather violent movie with one death scene in particular that could probably stand alongside the shower scene in Psycho as one of the best ever. However, it is not the violence alone that makes this movie work. Much of what makes this movie so disturbing is Dario Argento's use of color and different sound effects which keep you on edge throughout. He sort of makes it an art form, and that in itself is strange.The acting wasn't much to talk about, but I wouldn't say it's terrible either. In fact, a lot of it probably had to do with dubbing upon release in America.The entire movie left me unsettled throughout, and like I said, much of that had to deal with the color and sound. The death scenes, when they do come, are not forgotten, especially that one scene mentioned above which I will not spoil for anyone who wants to watch it.This is not a great movie, but its one that will be remembered once watched.",Suspiria
178,blakiepeterson,A Technicolor Nightmare,10,2 May 2015,"Suspiria is murderous Douglas Sirk, classy Lucio Fulci, and incomprehensible to the one-thousandth power. It is the closest thing the movies have ever come to capturing a nightmare on the screen. With its blaring, screechy progressive rock soundtrack (courtesy of the spine chewing Goblins), overwhelmingly (and nauseatingly) Technicolor set design, and convoluted stalk-and-slashes, Suspiria is unlike anything the horror genre has ever offered, for better or worse. I cannot say watching the film is a particular enjoyable experience; but yet again, being scared is not something most seek out when they want to have a good time. Tell me: were you ever really comfortable the first time you watched Halloween?I probably shouldn't be name-dropping Halloween willy-nilly; Suspiria is much more ambitious, and certainly much more excruciating to the eye. It's simultaneously offensive and luxurious to our sensitive pupils; the film drenches itself in the color palette of a Crayola based pop art painting, but the lack of realism in the atmosphere supplements its mystifying horror. As much as we attempt to throw our logic around in the visually combative mixture, it's impossible to truly understand what's really going on. There's something about witches and secret societies and Irises that lead to hidden hallways, but how can you focus on the plot when Dario Argento, bless his artfully messed-up heart, throws around red paint, rooms filled with barbed-wire, possessed German Shepherds, and maggot showers like its no big deal? Suspiria is comprised of the stuff your worst dreams are made of. It's not frightening in the traditional sense (i.e: sitting at the edge of your seat, jumping when a cat is suddenly thrown at the camera). Imagine laying on your couch peacefully; you blink, and suddenly, you find yourself falling off a cliff. Just because something doesn't make sense doesn't mean it isn't terrifying.With the wide-eyed power of a final girl, Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American dancer staying in Europe after being accepted into a prestigious ballet school. Her arrival is anything but welcoming; she enters the country during an explosive thunderstorm, and, when at the entrance of the academy, is not greeted by a well-meaning headmistress but a trembling girl, mumbling something about ""irises"" and ""secrets"" like she's mouthing her very last words. Most would know something is afoot, especially considering that that very same girl dies a mind- numbingly grisly death later that night; but Suzy, excited by the opportunities in her horizon, doesn't let an unfortunate death get in her way. But one can only ignore murder for so long. Slowly but surely, students and staff who even think about questioning the strict teachers drop like gutted flies. Surrounding the deaths are even more bizarre events, coming in the forms of poisoned food, spiteful bats, and yes, even maggot showers. Soon, Suzy discovers that her school is not suffering from a case of eccentricity but rather something  supernatural, you might say.Horror directors are usually annoyingly bent out of shape when it comes to their movies. It's as if they feel bad for frightening us, offering an apology in the form of a long-winded explanation as to why all the crazy events we recently witnessed happened and why the villains are so damn villainous. But Suspiria is vague, putting our brains in a blender of hallucinogens and then pushing us out onto a busy street. Argento wants nothing more than to terrify us, and that's that. He's done his homework, fondling a fish-eye lens and a passion for claustrophobic camera angles. The film is both vast and inescapable: the dance academy seems to be endless in its rooms, like a country of evil; but don't expect to stumble across an exit door anytime soon.When I say Suspiria is terrifying, I'm not putting it lightly. This is one of the scariest -and goriest - films to ever headline a mainstream cinema screen. It isn't any less shocking than it was 38 years ago, and, despite its pitiful dubbing, is awe-inspiringly aggressive. The colors slap you, and so does, well ... everything.

179,faraaj-1,Semi-tolerable Italian horror movie...,6,11 June 2006,Italian horror director Dario Argento's Suspiria is a very well perceived film. I wonder why? The plot concerns an female American student coming to study at a dance school in Germany. The dance school is actually a cover for more sinister ongoings. The plot is derivative and very slow-paced. Not much happens. The dialogue is passable at best but moderately well-dubbed.It is said that the movie was printed on a Technicolor strip hence the lush colors. Actually I find that hard to believe and the colors aren't lush. Early Technicolor movies are visually beautiful. This one isn't! The photography is irritating and there is a strong emphasis on red. The film is quite disgusting showing cuts and entrails and all without any horror accompanying it. The blood used in the movie was orange in color believe it or not. That in itself can be a damper. And the editing was one of the worst I have seen The two minor pluses were the German instructor - a real dyke. And of course the music which Dario Argento contributed to.,Suspiria
180,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,There must be better witch movies out there,6,11 February 2015,"Well considering the bloodshed that isn't actually that bad. I think the first killing happening pretty early in the movie is the most gruesome and graphic. The others weren't that bad but each of them took quite some build-up so that's good.The other thing I liked was female driven and pretty nice setting, really colorful especially towards the end. The mystery unraveling I always like that even though I knew pretty early on that the teachers and personnel were into witchcraft. That they put something in the girl's food to make her feel weak and tired reminded me a bit of Rosemary's Baby.But there were also some things I didn't like. The music I dunno if that is typical Argento but a times I think it was overdone while the atmosphere visually was good enough the music almost killed it. Biggest pain point for me was the storyline, I thought that was pretty weak. The characters stay pretty bland throughout the movie even the main actress. Also the ending seems rushed and quite easy solution. It's witchcraft all right but I think there must be better movies out there dealing with this theme.While it did have its strong points, as a story person I expected something more.",Suspiria
181,BHorrorWriter,Mesmerizing,10,28 January 2002,"This brilliant Italian horror film by the equally brilliant Dario Argento, is both dark and beautiful all wrapped up in one film. Dripping with superb lighting (alot of red, blue, yellow, green) an eerie, horrifying score, which alone adds to the chill factor of this film. Argento succeeds in making a twisted fairytale for adults. Though the plot doesn't fully develop itself...all is forgiven.  The camerawork, lighting, set peices, characters and score make up for the underdeveloped, and slightly tepid plot. The murder scenes in this film are a work of artistic genius.  We just don't have someone stabbing someone and they die.  We bare witness to a sickly beautiful kaliediscope of brutality and macabre sophistication.  The opening sequence alone proves this!  From the chilling encounter in the bathroom to the climax of broken glass, blood and dead bodies.  My heart is quivering now thinking of that knife being plunged into that womans heart! Argento treats the bodies like pieces of art...letting the camera soak up their grisly beauty.  The woman in the room of razor wire....such a display of human suffering!  The woman can see the door is slightly ajar, and if she can only make it to the door, she will be free. I must admit, the ending did seem a little rushed, and a trifle underdeveloped....but I don't feel Argento focused on it as much as a modern audience would.  His work seems to be more focused on getting the story on film and making is look and sounds brilliant.  You have to watch this film with the mindset of a 1977 audience.  With so many Scream clones and Halloween rip-offs, it is hard for audiences today to be scared of much more than a killer in a mask...which is sad! Overall, this is probably one of the greatest horror films ever created! 10 out of 10",Suspiria
182,arthurclay,I just like to call you a witch!,10,20 August 2005,"Better than I had expected. This is one of those films you should show someone who has no idea what it is about because it is so surprising and sinister. When a young American ballet dancer arrives in Rome to attend a famous dance academy she gets more than she bargains for as the academy harbors an ancient and lethal secret. She must discover it's dark history and destroy the evil than resides within it. There is a good plot twist right at the end which explains the first sequence in the movie perfectly. This film is quite violent and gory but it in my opinion does not detract from the plot. You are not quite sure who is doing the ""dirty deeds"" so to speak and I still don't know exactly who did them but it is irrelevant. The music is good but did get on my nerves a little which is what it is supposed to do. This is a good horror flick and made it onto several top ten horror lists that are posted on the web including AMC's top 100 scariest moments. Followed by the sequel ""Inferno"".",Suspiria
183,daggersineyes,You absolutely must see this!,9,24 August 2013,"Okay. If you are like me you might be sitting there wondering whether or not to watch this flick. It took me a long time to do it because the description didn't really grab me and the reviews I read here were confusing me. I thought it might be some dreadful 70's horror dreck that has a cult following just because it's awful. Some of the negative reviews I read here were so scathing it was really putting me off. But I kept seeing it being recommended at other sites so I decided to get more pro-active about my research. I followed the profile links for every single person who ""hated"" this movie and random links of profiles for those who loved it (there were far more of the latter so I couldn't check em all). My goal was to see what other movies they liked or hated to see where they were coming from & where they fitted with my tastes. And honestly, once I did that and realised what kind of people hated or loved this flick, I didn't hesitate to rush out and find Suspiria to watch it. I honestly suggest you do the same. Not just for this movie but for any other. The profile of the reviewer tells you a lot more than the review itself sometimes.Anyway - I cant add much to the plethora of positive reviews here already except to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and wish I'd taken the plunge to watch it sooner. It's rich colours, vivid stylistic murder scenes (and yes dear negative reviewers - they are MEANT to look stylistic), uncanny soundtrack and finely honed camera work will stay in my mind for ever. I love how Argento is able to create tension and dread out of the most ordinary things, never letting up, keeping his audience as wide-eyed and keyed up as the characters in his story. This is the third Argento film I have watched having only just discovered this amazing Director, the others being Tenebre and Phenomenon. I actually enjoyed Phenomenon slightly more than Suspiria - I think it has a richer plot line, better characters and slightly more accessible screenplay (by Argento's standards anyway) which is why I gave Suspiria 9 and Phenomena a rare 10. If you're new to Argento Phenomenon might be a better movie to start your discovery process with. But Suspiria is also brilliant. Just in a different, even more off-beat kinda way.A brilliant twisted suspense-filled horror fable full of awesome camera work, fascinating metaphor & cultural symbolism that will keep you on the edge of your seat and mesmerised at the same time. If you consider yourself to be any kind of movie lover and especially if you're a fan of horror you can't afford to let this one pass you by. Simple as that. Ignore the negative reviewers... they honestly just didn't get it but hopefully you, like the majority of it's happy viewers, will. :D",Suspiria
184,Horrorible_Horror_Films,A masterpiece,9,12 May 2010,"This film is gorgeous, stunning, thrilling and (in some parts) stomach turning. A true masterwork, and a true horror film.This movie is visual, a lot of meaning told through color, hue, and indirect lighting. The camera work is beautiful. ALL modern directors, especially every modern horror hack, should really try to freakin learn something from Argento.The red signifies blood, of course. But not just death, but life as well, the dichotomy that is blood - as lifeforce and death when blood is lost from the body. At some points the main character is bathed in indirect green light - sickness. Yellow windows with red centers - the heart. Perhaps, that's just my thinking on some of the visuals in Suspiria.The sets are stunning. Stunning. The death scenes truly horrorific, and the music is nothing short of superb.",Suspiria

The story goes, a woman joins a dance school and begins to find out secrets about it, dealing with the occult and witches. The story is very unique and very interesting, it is very suspenseful and very detailed. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is good and the characters are actually likeable and smart. The movie does a good job at making the character have a feeling of being tapped with no escape and it makes the film feel tense. Very well done and classic horror masterpiece.",Suspiria
186,kevin_crighton,Argento at his best.,10,1 May 2011,"Suzy Bannion, a young American dancer, arrives at a school in Germany to complete her studies. However, she soon gets caught up in some strange events as the truth about the school is revealed...Suspiria has so many things going for it, it's hard to know where to start. Jessica Harper brings the right amount of innocence and charm to the lead role. It's key that her character works as for the most part she's on screen. And Harper gives an excellent performance. She's giving strong support from the rest of the cast.The look of the film is stunning. The use of colours, especially the reds, is incredible. It makes the film, while without doubt a horror film, seem almost like a fairy tale. In fact if you consider the opening voice-over during the credits, it does give the feel of an adult fairytale.But then we get to the two most important things about Suspiria. The soundtrack and Argento himself. The music by the band Goblin, with a credit for Argento is stunning. Even without the images and listening to it on it's own is an unsettling feeling. But put together with the images Argento puts on screen? Then you get a truly nightmare feel.For me this is Argento at the height of his power. The opening twelve minutes of the film are amongst the most stunning put in any film I've seen, not just horror films. And while the rest of the film doesn't quite match the start, it comes close, right up to the unsettling ending.Although not known at the time, Suspiria became the first film of what is knowing as the 'Three Mothers' trilogy. But on it's own or as part of the trilogy, this is easily one of the best horror films made, and a one of my all-time favourites.",Suspiria
187,utahman1971,Awful,10,7 December 2011,"Dang, I can't see how the rating of this movie so high. Is it the eerie music? It was so boring in most of it. The only freaky part was the building looked strange. I never been to Europe. So I guess that means I know nothing.The blood looked fake. It was like watching a PG-13 horror fake horror movie of today. I say this is one of the worst movies I seen so far. There sure is a lot of terrible horror movies out there. I don't see how it was rated R. Hardly any blood, and only the word B*tch. I mean now a days PG-13 has F word.No way the rating of this movie can be 7+. It's just hard to believe people think these terrible movies are that good. I think most of these reviews must be from teenagers. I do not recommend seeing this movie. I will not watch this one again.",Suspiria
188,Torgo_Approves,"Gorgeous and suspenseful combination of colour, blood and music.",8,23 September 2006,"(r#70)Suspiria is, unlike many other ""classic"" horror movies from this period, actually very suspenseful, and artistically it is a triumph on all levels. Gorgeous colours and images, inventive camera angles, and a fantastic score to top it all off, make this a one of a kind film and a horror classic no one could ever remake.The beautiful Jessica Harper stars as Suzy Bannion, an exchange student who comes to a ballet school with more than a few dark secrets. There really isn't that much of a plot, and the acting is a bit corny at times, but the point of ""Suspiria"" isn't the plot nor the acting. You just have to let go and enjoy the enormous visual and musical pleasure of the film. Some of the most memorable scenes are the first, shocking murder, the revolting worms sequence, and the sadistic barb wire scene. This is simply a great film to look at which is more than a little suspenseful at times. What more could you want?This isn't a 70's low-budget cult movie like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Dawn of the Dead - neither of which I found very scary - this is a genuinely frightening movie that stands on its own as a unique cinematic achievement. If you only see one horror movie in your life, make it this one.",Suspiria
189,jrfranklin01,Not Bad For It's Time,7,30 April 2005,"You can't watch a 1977 horror movie and compare it to today, at least not on a special effects level. But what ""Suspiria"" does do effectively as a horror film for its time is to incorporate some good suspense and shock.The film is about a American, Suzy Bannion, who goes to Europe to study at a prestigious ballet academy. Upon the night she arrives, another student dies in a brutal stabbing (scenes of this are shocking). Afterward, other bizarre and deadly things begin to happen. The staff also seem controlling/manipulative over the entire school's attendants and goings on. Soon the occult and witchcraft become suspect.Mostly costume design is used given the film's date but there is one scene with a brief glimpse into some of the ""advanced"" sfx technology of the time. It's appears almost comical today as I'm sure our sfx will appear to others years down the road. The musical score (by The Goblins) reminds me of other old horror films that use music to scare or amp up the suspense. One scene in particular is shocking as it involves a student falling into a room filled with barb wire. If Clive Barker had directed this, it would have probably been a little too unsettling. 7/10",Suspiria
190,schroeder-gustavo,"Great Atmosphere, Poor Storytelling",6,10 June 2015,"Suspiria is a movie very well received by critics and many audiences and is actually considered by some to be one of the greatest horror/gore movies of all time. And I will give the movie a lot of credit because of the amazing atmosphere it creates. Dario Argento achieves this through an incredible combination of unusual lighting and disturbing music (that is really catchy by the way) and it draws the viewer into the movie and makes it a very interesting visual experience. However, the movie does suffer from many things that downgrade the experience for me. I am talking about the incoherent story, the dumb dialogue and the stuff that happens that makes no sense whatsoever. Like in the beginning of the movie when the first girl dies, she looks out the window and sees some cat-like eyes and someone starts strangling her, apparently flying or something cause her window wasn't in the first floor. Also a major problem is that some of the situations the characters get in are very poorly developed. I will say the dancers are pretty hot, though. Many plot points that I believe needed to be explained in the end, weren't, like who exactly killed everyone? And how did they possess the dog to kill the blind dude? I know it is kind of implied but I think they should have done a better job at developing these ideas.In the end I thought Suspiria had an amazing theme and very well done lighting that created a creepy atmosphere throughout, but because of the stupid, unreasonable dialogue and incoherent storytelling, Suspiria is barely a satisfying experience.",Suspiria
191,arishsankar,Terrifying,10,23 November 2018,"While it's true that some things are lacking (such as the story and the dubbing), many other things are enjoyable. As mentioned by many others, the lighting, sound track and backgrounds throughout the movie are very pleasing.

I got a few good laughs out of it too",Suspiria
192,Vampenguin,Argento is a master,9,12 June 2006,"Ever since I bought it for $2 on VHS, this has been one of my favourite horror movies. It was the first Italian horror I've seen, and unfortunately is still the only Argento film I've had the pleasure of viewing. If the rest of his film are as brilliant as this however, I'm really missing out! A little tidbit that I've always found interesting about this film is that it was originally written to star children. The producers wouldn't allow this, so Argento cast adults, but did not re-write the script. This really enhances the surreal feel of the film, as many of the lines seemed very out of place coming from women in their 20's.The real strength of the film lies in other ares however. First, the lighting and use of colour. As mentioned, Argento gives the whole film an eerie, dreamlike quality through various devices, but the most obvious and effective is the lighting. Always unnatural and unsettling, it creates a wonderful atmosphere.Add to this the amazing Goblin score and the wonderfully orchestrated deaths, and you have a movie sure to creep out most anyone. Highly recommended.9/10",Suspiria
193,ten-thousand-marbles,Not as good as the hype.,4,9 April 2020,"I've seen this movie on many of the best of lists over the years, and finally watched it. I was disappointed. It just doesn't stack up to other horror classics from the same era (Omen, Exorcist, Shining, Halloween, etc.) I understand it's a European film and things are done differently, but it was difficult to account for this. The story is sluggish, and the writing is comical at times. Watching the killer trying to flip the door latch with a straight razor was painful to watch. The excessive red lighting for effect is just too much, and I'm sure by 1977 the industry had come up with a convincing artificial blood that didn't have a striking resemblance to store brand ketchup. I respect the film for what it is, but just can't see it as a classic.",Suspiria
194,chelano,I love the music,6,17 October 2010,"Basically an American girl who loves ballet goes to Germany to join a very popular school there. Unfortunately it is run by witches. For a horror film, it is not that scary. It has the potential to be creepy and spooky, but not scary. Plus the fact you really don't see any witches. Well you do, but that would spoil it. The story line is OK for the film, but really doesn't have the suspense it needed to give a dynamite ending. Jessica Harper plays the main role and does a decent job. There are many side characters and they split with good and bad acting. There are many funny scenes in the film that you have to pay attention to see. For example, there is a pool in the school. Harper and another girl swim in shorts and a shirt. Why they didn't let them wear suits, I don't know. But the funny thing is that all they wore were shirts and you can easy see through them. The music for the film was played by a group called ""The Goblins"". This definitely gave the film a spooky feel. You would hear the music and it would make it feel like Halloween. So the movie did have a decent story line and it was fun to watch. Of course it could of been better, but at least you wanted to wait to the end to see what it happening. This is truly a better movie to watch than most horror films now a days.",Suspiria
195,Condemned-Soul,Dario Argento's horror masterpiece,9,15 August 2020,"From the framing, to the lighting, colours, sound, and gore, 'Suspiria' is an unrelenting nightmare from Dario Argento that's as much a feast on the senses as it is punishing on the nerves.Ballet student Suzy Bannion arrives at a prestigious dance academy in Germany, but after a series of brutal murders she comes to realise something much more sinister is going on...You can't talk about 'Suspiria' without highlighting its score: dreamlike, chaotic, menacing (sometimes all at once), Italian rock band Goblin deliver a truly masterful soundtrack that enhances everything on screen.And visually it's stunning too. Argento floods the frame with garish reds and other vibrant colours to add to the supernatural theme at play, while the violence is as stylish as it is shocking. The opening kill alone is an extraordinary, sensory-overloading sequence that sets you up for a real horror experience at the hands of a master craftsman who knows exactly how to frame the imagery for the strongest effect.Overall, this is an exceptional horror film that's visually daring, while providing a soundtrack that sounds so malevolent it's as if it was orchestrated in a ritualistic manner by a coven of witches. Brilliant.",Suspiria
196,thedarkhorizon,"Colorful, dark, musical fairytale disguised as horror. Outstanding!",9,7 January 2020,"(I won't talk about the storyline here! Look it up :) This is purely a note why I liked it personally!)I watched it after the 2018 adaptation and it was a good decision! The visual narration is strong, outstanding and from todays view (again) very modern. Strong, primal neon colors, harsh lighting, graphical sets make this film an eyecandy. The music collides with the actual sounds of the witches in the movie... well made, strong.This film sucks you into another world, where witches are real. more than 50 years old and still it feels so innovative.Why does it feel so intense and like a fairytale?
It was processed in ""Technicolor"" (adding blue,yellow, magenta and black filmstripes together to a colored image), which allowed to control color precisely. Just like Vertigo for example the colors are strong: blue, red, yellow, green, combined with strong, harsh light (often put very close to the actors faces) make this world feel so UN-real and otherworldy. Red bleeds out from doors and windows, just like the blood bleeds out from the skin. You can't escape the mood!The screeching sounds and hypnotic beats are strong and unique, throughout the film you get wrapped into it like a blanket. Till this day one of the strongest soundtracks I've heard.The graphical set paintings (lots of geometric primary shapes like rectangles, triangles and circles), exotic ornaments and very well places mirrors make it a labyrinth between Wizard of Oz and Alice in Wonderland (similar to the main character being an 'innocent' girl). You get guided in this otherworldy setting and often lose orientation between beauty and fear displayed there. (also, the sets were inspired by real life places (Hotel in Munich for example), Oz & Wonderland as well as Paintings by the surrealist M.C. Escher.)The cinematography and narrative pace while editing make each frame look like a well composed painting (in fact, due to color choices a lot of frames LOOK like a expressionistic paintings!). Often the camera aims above the actors head or leaves more space then necessary, so the characters feel small against the horrific world of witchcraft they can't control. Also, the camera always stays in motion, seemingly bodiless... we are floating through this world, restless, angry, filled with anticipation and fear... just like the mood of the film!There are many techniques that play well together in this film - a film so great it (maybe) can't be repeated. (and spoiler: the 2018 adaption didn't 'repeat' but created its own - great - vision).If you are in ANY way a cinephile or simply like films with tension and fantastical elements (and don't mind the 70s old-school horror effects), you will love it.

It seems that it is no longer scary now, but as a suspense film, it is worth watching many times. Although the plot is not novel, it can even pick out a lot of flaws, and the narrative is not perfect, but the audio-visual experience is different from any other horror film-Gothic electric soundtrack, strong and bright The colors, the lighting of the strange pioneers and the baroque setting are all hard to stop. How can such a stylized horror movie not make horror movie fans who are fascinated by intense sensory experiences hooked?In the use of color, the film uses four basic colors of red, yellow, blue and green as the main colors, which are mixed or alternated in most scenes. The strong color difference contrast and surreal lighting give people a feeling of falling asleep. Every frame is beautiful to the extreme. If you are not satisfied with the story itself, it is not bad to enjoy the expressionist paintings directly.",Suspiria

Special mention should be given to the excellent score by Goblin, which really adds a lot to the film and helps set the mood in all the right places.

199,ScottAmundsen,"Moody, Atmospheric, and Bloody",10,31 October 2010,"I am not always thrilled by overtly bloody horror movies; I tend to be more impressed with the sort of film, like Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING, that puts over its scares with suggestion.But every rule has at least one exception to prove it, and SUSPIRIA is one of my concessions to the blood-and-gore school of horror. Because Dario Argento does not rely solely on the gruesome effects to tell his story: he creates an other-worldly, oddly colored (with red predominant), utterly weird scenario that is so bizarre that I have always felt, watching this film, that this is what a bad acid trip might feel like.The plot is almost negligible: a young American woman arrives to study dance at a famous dance academy in Germany, and the weirdness starts the second she exits the airport and attempts to get a taxi.I won't reveal any more. The whole thing is so unutterably trippy that it has to be experienced, and there are some scenes that Argento seems to have put in the film just because he thought they were scary, since they have little to do with what plot there is.And all the while the proceedings are accompanied by a score that will always rate with the music from PSYCHO, JAWS, HALLOWEEN, and THE EXORCIST as some of the most frightening music ever composed for a film soundtrack.Another bonus to SUSPIRIA is that it gives us a chance to see the great Joan Bennett and Alida Valli in their later years; what they may have lost in looks they have not lost in talent. And I have never understood why Jessica Harper did not become a bigger star.Not for the squeamish. But if you like a good scare, hold on and go for the ride. It's worth it.",Suspiria
200,trans_mauro,"Very colorful, but very empty",2,18 October 2010,"Ah! Suspiria....One of the dumbest, silliest, and most overrated film I have ever watched.... Compared to it, a film such has ""Dr. Phibes"" is a masterpiece. And there are people that consider it a work of art. It is simply awful, the story goes nowhere, the plot is almost inexistent, and the script a mess, the acting is wooden, and the blood looks like cheap oil paint.Well, I have to admit that the sets are interesting, the colors are very vivid and the sound track by Goblin is not that bad, but what about the film itself? Where is the narrative.I fell asleep halfway through it, the dialog is very boring, dull It is so bad that Suspiria does not fit into that category of films ""it is so bad, it is good"". It simply is bad...Suspiria is one of those artsy-far**y films. Skip it. Watch the news instead. They are scarier...",Suspiria
201,Panterken,Surreal horror movie that has the best opening scenes of any horror movie...EVER!,7,25 February 2008,"I really liked 'Suspiria'. It's a totally other movie than most contemporary horror films, but I have heard that the same director (Argento) has many other similar movies.What I didn't like was the dubbing. Argento let's every cast member speak their native tongue and they dubbed it over in English later. This makes for some comical situations in intense moments. The main cast members (protagonists and antagonists) did all speak English as native language, but for some reason they had to dub their own dialogue later anyway. The lip sync on the main character is quite okay, the rest is not.Now about the movie itself. The story is quite stupid (though optimists may label it 'minimalistic' :p) and the end is horrible. Horrormovies shouldn't have anticlimaxes, the tension build up was good but then it just disappoints.Suspiria relies on tension and mood for 99% of it's entertainment worth. The plot is pretty irrelevant. And the acting was luckily not important since it wasn't very good at all.Argento really uses VERY theatrical music (which I didn't like but it does create a certain appropriate effect) and he drenches the screen in vibrant primary colors, with scenes dominated by great pools of reds, blues, yellows and greens. This provides for a very special effect and I really dug it. It's an inspired fever dream of a horror movie,surreal and very stylish.I'll end with the best: Suspiria has the best opening scenes of any horror film I've ever seen. It's beautiful, thrilling, haunting, intense, disgusting...all in a couple of minutes scenes. Of course I'm not talking about the first scene, but the scenes when the main character arrives at the academy.Furthermore, there are three additional scenes that are simply superb: the scene with the blind man on the empty square (BRILLIANT!), the scene with the roommate (where the lights go out :-)) and the scene with the red lights in the sleeping quarters.In conclusion: I have a love-hate relationship with horror films and I do too with this film. I love the intensity and the cinematography, but hate the theatricality, bad acting and the overdose of gore (the bloody heart makes me cringe).9/10 for half the movie (the night scenes LOL) , 4/10 for the other half (the day scenes: dancing lessons and witchcraft plot *yuck*). Makes for a 6.5/10 average.You might be surprised that this movie that I rated 6.5 is on the number 10 spot in my all time best horror movie list...",Suspiria
202,spacemonkey_fg,Remains one of Argentos Best,10,15 June 2005,"Title: Suspiria (1977) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Jessica Harper, Stefania Cassini, Flavio Bucci, Miguel Bosse, Udo Kier Tagline: The only thing more terrifying then the last ten minutes of this movie are the first 90.Review: I've seen most of Argentos films, and I must say that Suspiria remains one of my all time favorite Argento films.Suzy is a young dancer who travels to Europe to continue her dance studies. She is accepted in a special dance school. Little by little she finds out that there is more to this dance school then meets the eyes.I liked everything about this movie, first off Ill start with the films unique visual style. I've read many times about Argentos colorful and surreal style, now I can see what all the talk was about.Every single frame is bathed in beautiful colors. Lots of Reds and greens and blues. The colors are not just there, I mean the colors in this film are LOUD, they are there for you to notice them and to make every frame that they are in just a beauty to look at. They make the film have a certain surreal feel that only added to the story. The colors perfectly matched the type of feel that the story needed and I applaud Argento for that.His visual style and storytelling also impressed me very much. I noticed that Argento is a bit like Tobe Hooper in the sense that he likes to torture his audience, but not in a bad way. I noticed in quite a few scenes Argento would stretch the tension and the suspense to the point where you feel like your being tortured but in a good way. A good example of this is that scene with the blind pianist and his dog on the streets. The scene is spooky....Argento focused on shadows and buildings creating an atmosphere of dread. You almost feel that at any moment someone will jump out of the shadows...great control of storytelling and suspense that was good stuff.I also enjoyed the music. Again, I think this also was perfectly matched with the type of story Argento was trying to tell. A mix of moans, shrieks, whispers and guitar twangs...that was just eerie as hell. Great job from the Goblins.The gore was there in a few murder scenes...and just when needed. I don't feel that Argento abused of the gore like maybe Fulci would. Argento only reserved that gore for when it was absolutely necessary for the story. But when its there, boy is it there.And as long as I'm talking about the story...let me just say that I'm very surprised that this movie made sense. I remember watching some of Fulcis movies and feeling lost and angry at times at that constant incoherence. Not so here, Argento made a decent and intelligible story. And a spooky one at that. Not a lot of action and not a lot of gore...but if your really into it you'll find that the movie has some truly creepy moments. Like for example, the first few scenes with Suzy in the middle of the storm, the students counting the footsteps of the teachers in the night...the blind mind waiting for his killer to come out of the shadows...just really eeiries scenes. Obviously this movie is more focused on atmosphere and creepiness rather then going for cheap thrills.This is the type of story where you feel that the protagonist is slowly being taken into a dark place that will change them forever, and they are practically helpless to do anything about it. Kind of like Mia Farrow in ""Rosemarys Baby"" where she was being dragged into this world of magic and satanism and she was almost completely powerless to it. That is the feeling I got while I watched Suspiria.Well what can I say, I've found yet another movie to add to my ""best of all time"" list. Really creepy story, good performances, great style, great music and just good spooky fun.Rating 5 out of 5",Suspiria
203,el7,Stunningly beautiful supernatural giallo.,9,19 October 2020,"Suspiria, directed by Dario Argento, is about a ballet dancer named Susan who leaves New York City to study at a cloistered academy in a small town in Germany located near the Black Forest. The same night she arrives, another student tries to run away from the academy, to dire consequences. As Susan settles in and befriends another student named Sarah, strange things begin to happen, and then they escalate. This is one of those movies where it's probably better going in not knowing what you're in for, but at the same time is also one of those movies that's been out so long that there's little chance of that happening. The film's plot is actually fairly simple at its heart: the academy has a dark secret, and Susan gradually sees the necessity of discovering that dark secret else she meet the same fate as several of her associates. Greek mystery rites and German fairy tales are both referenced heavily throughout, in the story's theme and also in the film's imagery. The symbolic use of color is astounding, frequently washing the screen in overwhelming primary colors. The sound design is overall excellent, with a score built around a creepy little music box melody layered with creepier vocals and death knells. The soundtrack can drop out suddenly, such as when an unseen assailant tries to gain entry into Sarah's room while she makes a desperate escape attempt out of a very high window. Then all you hear is the scraping of the switchblade in the lock and Sarah's gasps of breath, and it's very eerie. The movie is also heavily dubbed, which was a common practice back when this film was released but 21st century audiences might not have much patience for it. Some of the dialogue is on the nose to the point of being cheesy by post Kevin Williamson/Kevin Smith/Joss Whedon/Diablo Cody standards. There are some parts that seem cliche now but weren't when this film came out, such as the exposition fairy who shows up late in the movie to talk to Susan about witches. My personal favorite part of this movie is the finale, as it's rise and fall is so rapid you hardly have time to get used to what's happening on the screen before the scene is changing again. The witch behind the sheet is creepy as hell, and I've seen my fair share of zombies, many of which were rendered with better practical effects than this one, but just imagine that it's the body of your friend laughing in someone else's voice and think about how awful that would be. That's an image that's not coming out of my head for a while. The end seems a bit abrupt, but it's also perfect that way. Sometimes you don't need to know what happens to the hero after the final frame, and this is one of those times.",Suspiria
204,davidslicer,Dario Argento at his most terrifying.,10,9 January 2001,"How do I describe the Dario Argento classic ""Suspiria""? Yes,it is a horror movie that has been in existence for nearly a quarter of a century and it is considered one of the most frightening films of the seventies.We deal with the forces of the supernatural involving some of the most spookiest scenes that even had me sleeping with the lights on.The film stars Jessica Harper.In the film,she plays a young woman from New York who arrives at a European ballet academy to pursue her dreams of being a dancer.The school is actually a haven for witches that terrorize the school and our main character must now face the forces of evil.The film is slow moving but the tension builds slowly causing the fear to take hold of the viewer.Dario Argento releases the fear in this film with it's eerie score and it's production design.The cinematography is very effective.""Suspiria"" was suppose to be a trilogy on ""The Three Mothers"".But after the second installment ""Inferno"" didn't do so well,He felt it was not a good idea.""Suspiria"" is a classic horror film and I think it stands out as Dario Argento's best work.",Suspiria

Beautiful Jessica Harper stars as Suzie Banyon, an American dancer who goes to a prestigious dancing school in Germany. People are getting murdered in strange ways. Little does Suzie know the academies horrifying secret. ""Suspiria"" is one of the most creepy horror films of the 70's. It's magical yet bloody, it's beautiful yet horrifying.

206,Zombified_660,"Worth watching for horror completists, but not as classic as it's made out to be.",6,19 May 2010,"Being a huge fan of Deep Red, Tenebre and Phenomena, and having seen several other Argento films, I tracked Suspiria down too. At the time I bought it, it was fairly hard to get, and the only copy I could find was an R1 special edition. I figured quids in.With this being an exhaustive special edition package, and listed on IMDb as the 'fullest' cut of the movie available, I assume outside of watching it on my telly, I watched the best version I could get my mitts on.Suspiria is an extremely stylish film with a sustained atmosphere and artistic direction that's very powerful. Artistically, outside of some very creaky special make-up effects that look like an art student's attempt at a horror movie, not a real horror movie, the film is hard to fault.Its soundtrack is a masterpiece. An absolute masterpiece.Unfortunately as entertainment instead of art, Suspiria is rubbish. The movie runs only 92 minutes, a good 20 minutes shorter than most of Argento's giallos, but feels like an eternity compared to the fleet-footed Phenomena or the well paced epic that is Deep Red. It's dull, uninteresting, and even the much vaunted set-pieces irritate more than impress and are fury-inducingly few and far between.Horror/stalk and slash set-pieces are gratingly slow, going through tension and into 'god just kill them off already', and go out of imaginative into just plain ludicrous. One girl is murdered after nearly ten minutes of preamble by a disembodied werewolf arm with a knife while inexplicably being seemingly astrally projected between 4 different locations as she absorbs way more stab wounds than any human body could possibly sustain, only to finally die when thrown through a window she wasn't anywhere near attached to a cord that seemed to be wrapped round half her house. An hour later, another girl comes a cropper after nearly 15 minutes by climbing through a window and into a room that has for no obvious reason been used to stock several cubic foot of barbwire, then murdered by another disembodied arm. They are intentionally long, drawn out, and, oddly for Argento, limply shot from unimaginative angles, relying on bizarre colour combinations and 'nails on chalkboard' music to try and make them frightening. Tenebrae this is not. Do not expect any crazed hand-held shots, any 'Axe POV' shots, or even that many close ups. Do expect a chronically bad cardboard heart at one point though.On top of this, relatable characters do not exist in Suspiria. Jessica Harper is eminently watchable but epically useless, leaving her entire friendship group to die while she languishes in bed with a headache most of the film. Everyone else aside from the head of the school is window-dressing, either props to the dancing school atmosphere or cannon-fodder for the long-winded murder sequences.The storyline is limp-wristed and unimpressive. Here it is: Oops. I joined a school run by a murderous coven of witches. Better do something about that...once I've taken some paracetamol and someone stops flashing that red light in my eyes. That's about it.The biggest problem by far though is that the environment Suspiria happens in is so poorly defined. There are no rules or reality at all in this movie. Initially this is terrifying and confusing. By minute 25 you'd kind of expected a storyline to kick in and it hasn't, and you're checking your email at the same time as watching the film.Point is, most Argento fans are divided by 'is Suspiria best or Deep Red'. I come down on the Deep Red side. Deep Red is a movie. Designed for entertainment purposes by a highly creative and artistically left-of-field director. Suspiria is an indulgent vanity project created with an 'art first, narrative and coherency later' approach. I felt like it was intentionally designed to alienate and confuse instead of entertain and engross, and it was an extremely frustrating and boring, if beautiful 92 minutes.",Suspiria
207,fredberglyle,Suspiria - Suspense undisclosed,6,15 October 2013,"Certainly not the scariest movie but still Argento's scariest and second best to 'Profondo Rosso'. The BGM is good as usual but still more mysterious. Very straight forward screenplay with a weak and predictive plot. The acting is satisfactory and characterization is too shallow. Other elements of DA's like pretty young women getting murdered, scenes with blood streams and characteristic suspense music are positives of the movie. It suffers from various pitfalls that include the ballet dances missed details. It is a movie to watch alone on a stormy or a rainy night yet still be warned of bloody ultra- violence.",Suspiria
208,slabihoud,Bright colors but dim horrors,5,9 November 2018,"I guess I will upset a lot of fans of this film, but hey, that's the way I feel about it.Just watched this film for the first time last night in its newly restored version. Of course I heard about it every now and then and expected something really gory and shocking. But, oh boy, some films really age badly, not only the film stock, but the content as well. The colors are great again, no doubt and the restoration was certainly needed. Alas, the story would have needed a lifting too!The film borders hard on being camp, the acting is largely ridiculous, not only by the young actors but by the well known ones as well. Ironically, Some of the scenes were so absurd that it became painful to watch and the bad dubbing did not help at all. Allida Valli was over the top in most of her scenes but seemed to have fun and the audience laughed on many occasions. Udo Kier, usually known for strong and sometimes over the top performances delivered the most convincing piece of acting. I will not go into discussing plot holes because this would take up too much space here.The music of the film is a chapter of its own. First I was intrigued by the reversal of what is expected. Instead of a quietly unnerving soundtrack Dario Argento uses full blast percussion to create an unsettling mood, which worked. But unfortunately he uses this technique far too often and the music drowns out all noise.Yes, Dario Argento is a good director and a lot of the outrageous stuff, e.g. acting, decoration, music and blood is on purpose and can be compared to opera. For me it wasn't a horror movie but only a mild thriller with dated effects. Interestingly, one theme which is usually connected with boarding schools was completely missing. There have been zero references to love or sex and this in a house full of beautiful young women and men! Except for that, it reminded me of late Hammer Film productions and, sorry, also of late entries in the Edgar Wallace series, since they have been produced in Italy and had a similar look.",Suspiria
209,Milk_Tray_Guy,"Fascinating, surreal horror",7,22 October 2021,"I hadn't seen this for a good 15-20 years - and it's as weird and surreal as I remember. Not least due to the dreamlike score (by prog-rockers Goblin) which lurks in the background, in a similar way to Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells in The Exorcist. Visually it's gorgeous, with those blocks of blue, green, and - especially - red, that Argento loves so much (the hallways almost look like Mark Rothko paintings).Some of the deaths really impress; the friend of the girl near the beginning who gets impaled when the skylight falls in, the girl near the end who falls into a pit of razor wire, and - my favourite - the blind guy getting his throat torn out... by his own guide dog! The remake dragged at times (it's exactly an hour longer) and didn't always hold my attention. No problem like that with this. I can't say it's great (some of the lip-syncing/dubbing is distractingly off, like a spaghetti western, and one or two of the performances are a bit hammy), but it's a really fascinating watch. 7/10.",Suspiria

She must then try to figure out what is happening, and I don't want to totally give away what it is. The most amazing thing about this movie is the imagery, and the lighting. The movie has one of the best uses of colors in the history of film. It is a beautiful film to look at, although at the same time, it can be a vicious film. The plot and writing can be a bit weak at time, but the amazing colors, and amazing sets make up for it. It has some of the coolest murder sequences, and was way ahead of it's time.

The music by ""The Goblins"" is annoying more than frightening. And having all the victims scream, run and do virtually nothing to defend themselves (except the lead character) is just plain pathetic.Beyond the story itself, the audio and audio effects are absolutely abysmal and downright laughable.It's not all bad though.

It is an all out assault on your senses. As the ad-campaign says Suspiria is the most terrifying film you have ever HEARD! The soundtrack was impressively composed by the often overlooked group Goblin and is eerie throughout. The lighting and visual effects used by Argento were also extremely innovative for the time period. The story is chilling, Susy Banion, an American Balerina, travels to Europe to attend a very elite dance academy run by a coven of witches. The elaborate murder sequences in this film are not just horrifying, they are actually very artistically done which makes them almost beautiful...something no one has mastered quite like Dario Argento because even though the viewer is absolutely shocked, appalled and alarmed by what they see you simply cannot take your eyes off of it because of the way that it is presented.",Suspiria

The color schemes used in the production design are absolutely brilliant, and beautiful as well.  Dario Argento choreographed the death scenes very well.  Unfortunately, other than those imaginative death scenes (first time I've ever seen a shot of a knife going through someone's heart), the film is all pretty pedestrian.  The story involves humdrum supernatural elements that we've seen many times before.  There's no real surprises, the characterizations are thin.  Also, the pacing is uneven, and many scenes drag out.

217,RomanJamesHoffman,"The psychedelic old, dark house",8,28 October 2012,"Dario Argento's 'Suspiria' is nothing less than a raging, delirious, hallucinogenic nightmare caught on film. Having established himself as a name in the giallo genre (an Italian detective story-cum-proto slasher) with the likes of the awesome 'Profondo Rosso', Argento teamed up with his partner Daria Nicolodi to craft a supernatural thriller suffused with lavish Italian cinematography and a glorious Grand Guignol approach to cinematic killsall set to a pumping, haunting rock-opera soundtrack.The film is the first part in Argento's ""Three Mothers trilogy"" (the other parts being 'Inferno' (1980) and 'The Mother of Tears' (2007)) and follows Suzy Bannion (played to deer-in-the-headlights perfection by Harper) as she arrives in Germany to attend a famous dance academy. The excessive art nouveau stylings (a masterstroke of set design) of the labyrinthine academy and bold use of Mario Bava-esque colouring immediately usher Suzy (and the viewer) into a surreal atmosphere which, in its sheer over-the-topness, achieves a kind of hysterical Gothic expressionism akin to Whale's 'The Old Dark House' (1932) except with Edvard Munch as interior designer. Populating this odd milieu are the staff and dancers - all of whom accentuate the already bizarre environment with their odd and disconcerting mannerisms. The oddness continues as people are off-ed in some imaginative set-pieces which motivate Suzy to investigate the academy where she unearths its occult history before coming face-to-face with the Mother of Sighs.However, while the lavish set design, use of colour, and rampaging score effectively disorientate the viewer with a full-on sensory assault, some criticise the movie for being more style than substance and this is kind-of understandable as the acting and dialogue are a bit patchy and the plot was nothing new even in 1977 (after all, by this time we had already had such supernatural horror landmarks as 'Rosemary's Baby' (1968) and 'The Exorcist' (1973) as well as the brutal and wholly un-supernatural 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974)). This point is underscored by the fact that, whilst loving 'Suspiria', it would be remiss if I didn't mention that it didn't scare me so much as remind me of being scared. What's more, it reminded me of being scared by past nightmares rather than anything real. This said, like a good Gothic novel, the hysterics (which in a cinematic context would include set design, cinematography, and score) are what it's all about and thus style and substance are fused and (at least for me) patchy acting and dialogue become absolved. Maybe some would be less forgiving, but I found the demonic hallucinatory quality of 'Suspiria' so well-crafted that disbelief was easily suspended and I was rewarded with an air of disquiet and Gothic derangement evocative of my childhood, hammer horror infused, nightmares.So, flaws there may well be, but despite the influence 'Suspiria' has had on generations of horror movies since, it still manages to stand apart as a singular entity which, like the storm at the start of the movie, will sweep you up and let you freefall into a dizzying descent into occult, dreamlike claustrophobia.",Suspiria
218,matheusmarchetti,A Child's Nightmare,10,17 September 2007,"The 70's was undoubtedly the best decade ever for horror films. Often quoted as one of the finest of that period, the fact that ""Suspiria"" stood the test of time is basically due to it's originality compared to films such as ""The Exorcist"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", who tried their best to make a horror film that was as close as possible to something that could actually happened. Argento goes the other way around, by taking his audience out of the normal world, and into the darkest corners of the subconscious, where fears we long thought didn't exit anymore, childish fears such as those of the Witch in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"", are suddenly reborn. With expressionistic set design that seem to suffocate the characters within, as well as extreme use of sound and colors, this is a child's nightmare captured on celluloid. An Argento trademark, he once again proves he's a master at creating some of the most unique death scenes in cinema, which are so bloody violent, and yet the camera lingers on them with childlike fascination, the events bathed in a wonderful combination of primary colors. The script of the film is often criticized, but I consider it quite solid and I just love the fairy tale vibe it has. Indeed, Suspiria is nothing more than a fairy tale, a dark, twisted fairy tale and when you stop to think of it, in the same style the Grimm Brothers use to write their stories. In any case, the plot follows a young American girl joining a renowned ballet school in the Black Forrest in Freiburg, Germany. A series of strange, supernatural events start to take place and soon she finds out the school is merely a front for a coven of evil, and powerful witches. I have to admit the finale is not as great as the rest of the film, but it's good on it's own right and the apparition of the queen witch scares me to this very day. The acting is good, with strong performances by Jessica Harper (who also stared in another favorite film of mine - Brian De Palma's Phantom of the Paradise) as the protagonist Suzy, as well as other great cult starts such as Alida Valli, Joan Bennet and Udo Kier. I recommend Suspiria not only for horror fans, but fans of quality cinema as well.",Suspiria
219,ernesti,Something that i hadn't seen before.,10,1 August 2012,"I watched this movie about six years ago and still i haven't forgotten it so it must be special in many ways.It made an impact on me somehow with its scenes of cruel violence and nightmarish atmosphere throughout the film. It's completely dream-like with colourful palette that has never been seen before and maybe nothing like this has ever been made even up to this day.Even today it doesn't seem to have aged much at all although having seen many Italian movies in this genre it is beginning to seem quite tame.It's an art movie, like a painting. This is how horror should be like, something that draws the complete attention up until the credits show up on the screen and the viewer is just relieved that it's over. That's exactly how a horror movie should impact and if it does not do that, then it's not much of a horror.Coherent plot? Nope, but still i don't think that it's watched for its plot anyway. Plot has never been the strongest point in movies directed by Argento or even in Italian giallo and horror genre.",Suspiria
220,Amthermandes,"While a bit ""dated"", still an engrossing horror classic",7,1 September 2021,"Dario Argento, while he struggles with consistency and realistic-looking blood (ALWAYS looks like melted wax in his films), is a master at visual storytelling and intriguing plots. This is a fine horror film, a must-see for any self-acclaimed ""horror buff."" One of Argento's best.Visual and audial clues and themes dominate the screen. The dubbing is rather poor and distracting, but most likely a vestigial remnant of the age in which Italy dubbed movies constantly to ensure that they'd be understood by foreign viewers. It's a signature trademark of Argento's works, one that coincides with some of Italy's most popular spaghetti westerns. It seems to affect the acting to a certain degree, but to some degree, seems to add that little bit of ""character spice"" to the flick. All in all, while the dubbing is distracting, it's not as bad as a lot of his other films.There are some praise-worthy aspects to this film, other than the visual effects. Film students can learn a lot fro this piece. So can most of modern Hollywood horror screenwriters and directors. But with the visual (and audial) effects being the most effective and influential traits of this film, the rest, such as the plot, acting, pace, is all just mediocre at best.Still, definitely worth a view. Unless you tend to shun older flicks because you find the horror special effects pre-dating the 90's was too unrealistic, then you might struggle with this. It's not scary, especially to anybody who's seen a hundred horror movies, but it's quite interesting and it certainly has its moments!",Suspiria
221,Vince-5,Gory Italian classic sets the precedent,10,17 June 2001,"The ultimate European horror film, Suspiria is one of those pictures where everything comes together perfectly. It contains the most brilliant use of color I've ever had the pleasure of seeing; lurid yellows, blues, greens, and blood reds gush from the screen at every turn, and they're magnificently applied to bizarre Gothic-modern sets and decor. Luciano Tovoli's lens glides over everything like an otherworldly specter as Goblin's electronic rock score chimes, pants, and crashes away on the soundtrack. The result makes you tense up even when nothing important is happening on screen...or is it?But even as the build-up puts you on the edge of your seat, the shocks immediately shove you right off. The murders are thoroughly sadistic yet beautifully presented and are never quite what you would expect. And they don't occur just when you think they will, allowing you to partially exhale before choking on it. Like a true maestro, Dario Argento lets you off the hook for a brief split-second before ramming it deep into your flesh.Wide-eyed Jessica Harper, resembling a beautiful china doll, is perfect as delicate heroine Susy Banyon. Stefania Casini is memorable as her sexy friend. Alida Valli makes a great dominatrix, and Dark Shadows' Joan Bennet, clad in a succession of Walt Disney birthday cakes, is ornately imposing as the stuffy administrator. Every facet comes together fantastically, resulting in a hellish fairy tale brimming with hallucinatory panic and suffocating tension. This pulsating chunk of raw terror is the ultimate testament to Argento's talent. I first saw it years ago on the Sci-Fi Channel, and even in a butchered-for-TV state, it scared the living hell out of me. Truly astounding, Suspiria is horror that like you've never experienced it before.",Suspiria
222,phillindholm,"''She must die, die, DIE! """,10,30 August 2005,"""Suspiria"" has been acclaimed as director Dario Argento's masterpiece. And it certainly is. The plot is fairly simple. American ballet student Susy Banyon (Jessica Harper) travels to Germany to attend an exclusive ballet school. Once there, she discovers that there is more going on within than just dance instruction. Although the school's directress, Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) welcomes her warmly, she is unsettled by her aide, Nazified teacher Miss Tanner (Alida Valli), as well as several mysterious student disappearances. When her new friend Sara (Stefania Casini) is the latest to vanish, Susy begins her own investigation of the academy. Filmed in bright, lurid Technicolor, and accompanied by a thundering soundtrack by Goblin, Suspiria is a nightmare-come-to-life. The performances of Harper, Bennett and especially Valli (like Bennett, a major star of the Golden Age) are solid, as is the unrelentingly creepy atmosphere. Also on display are two especially gruesome murders which happen near the beginning of the film. Argento later said that he modeled the look of the film directly on Walt Disney's ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and, indeed the similarities are apparent. ""Suspiria"" may not always make perfect sense plot wise, but it's a thrilling roller-coaster ride through what may very well be Hell. ""Suspiria"" ranks as one of the best Italian-made horror films of all time.",Suspiria
223,hung_fao_tweeze,"Hard to pin down, but you may not want to.",7,29 December 2003,"Some movies require the viewer to prepare themselves ahead of time. This is one of them. The first time I saw this was on the big screen in 1977. It has never left me. I didn't know who Dario Argento was then but I became a cautious fan after my initial viewing. And yet, much as I have a fondness for this film and am compelled to watch it again, I tend to dwell a bit before taking the dive. The first minutes of the film are indeed anxiety inducing. At first it looked like the legendary 'snuff' films we've all heard so much about. Very disturbing and yet somehow beautiful. I didn't like what I was feeling. Cool! It occurs to me as it has to many of the other reviewers that this just might be ART. Since I have indeed taken the plunge a few more times and endured this flick, I agree. It is.
The colors of the sets - tongue red, bile blue, gall bladder green. Ew! The colors are beautiful in the way they unbalance you with their vivid gaudiness. Shadows Caligarically cast darkened scars across the walls, furniture, and, of course, the players. The rain shadows on the red walls - good visual idea.The acting wasn't bad - but it wasn't great either. At least it wasn't quite what I expected. All of the effort that seemed to be put toward establishing character in the characters was wasted. A lot of whispering. I didn't establish sympathy for any character. I was scared for most of them. After that opening scene I just assumed everyone involved was merely meat waiting to be harvested. So I detached. The story isn't hard to follow but doesn't necessarily follow logic either. There are nightmarish dreamlike qualities to many of the scenes. Logic doesn't have to prevail because no matter what you do, you are doomed. This leaves the viewer even more upset and unbalanced. Often this is a good thing to get from a horror movie, n'est ce-pas? The ending was a touch more abrupt than I would have liked. You are kind of dropped - so there.Now the music - wow. What a noise. Very voodooish and somewhat haunting. It builds and builds. Hypnosis sets in. You know something is going to happen but, man, getting there can be real suspenseful-like. Frequently the soundtrack overwhelms what is actually going on. You have to wonder whether that wasn't done on purpose. I think it was because the effect worked on me. All you can do is stare at the carnage. Neat!At the end of the day this movie is like a craving. You want to see it but not necessarily have to go through until you're ready. There are maggots beneath the skin of this film. It is definitely worth seeing as a film student. If you like horror films with a bit of gore that could also be called art - this is the movie for you. I liked it but I can never guarantee when I am going to be compelled to see it again. I am getting old and faint of heart.",Suspiria
224,ALauff,"Compels me to seek out more Argento, although lacking somewhat on its own terms",6,15 February 2005,"Intermittently gripping at its most gruesome, but that's about it. The story is unfocused, the performances unremarkable, but Argento's evocation of supernatural dread, of sharp, hirsute limbs whooshing in from off-screen to claim virgin sacrifice, is the main attraction, and it's mightily impressive considering the lack of resources. His mastery of certain film-making elements—the Gothic music of chants and bells, the withholding of a key plot point (here, a crucial bit of dialogue) until the moment of greatest impact—is undeniable. However, these strengths are largely invested in the delivery of several go-for-broke set pieces that, although quite accomplished in themselves, compromise the continuity and movement of the film as a whole. By the end, the whole unwieldy thing is running on fumes.",Suspiria
225,LinkGoku,This is still a great horror film!,9,28 February 2014,"I'm only twenty years old so I never had the chance to see the great horror films of the 80's, 70's etc.. That being said I've been wanting to see Suspiria for a while, I was excited to finally see it. The thing that surprised me most was the death scenes, while this film was more character driven and didn't rely on terror and violence there are still a few violent scenes, and they're done amazingly, probably the bloodiest deaths I've scene in a 70's movie. But more then that this film has a fantastic score, brilliant sets that add to the eeriness, the acting does not disappoint either. It's a really surreal and darkly beautiful movie. It's hard to find anything wrong with this movie, though I did find the ending to be a bit underwhelming. But it's still a must see horror classic!",Suspiria
226,Anyanwu,Good and in some instances great,7,7 January 2000,"Most people who comment on this movie rate it is great. The use of lighting and color was superior. Any student of horror films should watch this movie to learn how it is done.  The suspense factor is very high. I thought it leaned a little bit to much toward cheesy slasher effects. It's not that I don't like bloody slasher scenes, it's just that if they are going to be used they better be really good. The best aspect of the film was the music. I was really suprised to hear how aggressive the music was. It was used to enhance the suspense and drama. The best part about it was that it doesn't sound dated. I think it was ahead of it's time considering the date of 1977. It could be heard today and not sound old. All in all I would recommend this film to any fan of suspense and horror.",Suspiria
227,Phantasm01,One of Dario Argento's finest!,9,30 May 2006,"It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere in any format let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated versions. Unfortunately most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days more people know about the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. Out of all of his masterpieces--""Deep Red,"" ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage,"" and ""Tenebre"" among them--the one that stands head and shoulders above all others is ""Suspiria."" I recently sat down to watch this after a long period of anticipation. Everything you've seen and heard about it is true; this is Argento's epic masterwork.It doesn't start out that way, though. American Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) is a gifted ballerina arriving in Europe to attend a rather elite German dance academy in Freiburg. The opening sequences of the film find young Suzy arriving at the airport, hailing a taxi, and heading out to the school in the pouring rain. ""O.K.,"" you say to yourself, ""I've seen horror films open with similar sequences before."" And you're right--you have seen movies begin in such a mundane way. Then Argento throws out one of his massively disturbing murder scenes, i.e. a young girl from the academy perishes when a knife plunges into her heart. Again, no big deal, right? Wrong. If you've seen a couple of Argento films you know full well how he displays on screen carnage. It goes on and on in gooey close-up, and the same happens here. The stabbing is so gruesome that even this extremely jaded horror fan cringed repeatedly. I cringe now just recalling the sequence. The killing is a rather inauspicious incident marking the arrival of Suzy, especially since the young ballerina happened to witness a few clues that explain what occurred. Of course, she doesn't know that yet. Nor do we. Argento will remind us of these clues at the horrific denouement.And what a denouement! Stylish, haunting, colorful, and deeply frightening; these are the hallmarks of ""Suspiria,"" not only in the conclusion to the film but also in the lead up as well. Everything is weird at this academy, slightly askew in an ominous and vague way. Suzy's fellow students seem oddly aloof, the instructors possess a shrill and vicious temperament that occasionally breaks through their carefully constructed facade, and the building itself oozes menace. Strange noises permeate the floors of the building, footsteps are heard shuffling about late at night, and Suzy soon begins to feel ill. What's going on? Well, it's got something to do with the sort of women we normally associate with pointy hats and broomsticks. Yep, you heard correctly: Suzy Bannion walked into a building housing a coven of witches. These are powerful women with an ancient past and a horrific record of murder and mayhem. Suzy's investigations into the bizarre events at the academy will soon find her face to face with these malefic old biddies in a series of hidden rooms that positively reek of evil. Will Bannion triumph over the witches? One thing is for sure--one must be careful with creatures that can kill with the wave of a hand.I could literally provide a scene by scene breakdown of this film without revealing any significant spoilers because ""Suspiria"" whizzes by in an anarchic way that defies logical description. It's all about style, really, as Argento beefs up the color schemes to frenzied levels. He also imbues the film with his trademark violence, violence that sees a man's throat torn to shreds, a heart repeatedly perforated with a very sharp knife, and a cruel scene involving a room of barbed wire that one must see to believe. Most importantly, Goblin provides yet another immensely haunting score--an eclectic mix of strings, drums, and disturbing voices--that increases exponentially the sense of impending doom the viewer feels as he or she watches the proceedings. ""Suspiria"" even manages to cast veteran actor Udo Kier in the role of a psychiatrist who knows quite a bit of disturbing information about the dance academy. ""Suspiria"" is Argento's first and best entry in his venerated ""Three Mothers"" trilogy (the third installment has yet to appear), and it's far, far better than its follow-up ""Inferno,"" an even more confusing film than this one. Without a doubt, all of Argento's trademark techniques find perfect expression in this tour de force.A big movie requires a big DVD, and you can pick up a three disc ""Suspiria"" set that gives us the film in all its colorful glory. We also get a lengthy documentary about the making of the film, production notes, trailers, an entire disc devoted to Goblin's chilly soundtrack, and plenty of other goodies to whittle away the hours. I read recently that someone plans on remaking this film, apparently in an attempt to cash in on audiences willing to see updated versions of Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""The Exorcist,"" and several other genre staples. I can't imagine anyone creating a better version of Argento's classic film; it's a movie in a league all its own and should stay that way.",Suspiria
228,noahbetancourt,Loud and occasionally creepy,7,4 August 2020,"As a huge horror fan, Suspiria was not as good as I was hoping it would be. However, because I'm a big film fan, it helped me appreciate it more, and it's still not a bad movie. It's very well made and has some really great camera work on display. The acting is also much better than in most Italian horror films. The movie is very slow at times, but can get very creepy, which is a good thing. Even at a low volume, the movie is loud which adds to the creepiness. The opening murder is also intense and somewhat gory. This is not something I would probably watch again, but as a one time thing, it was good and definitely is responsible for many modern American horror films.",Suspiria
229,Tender-Flesh,Style over substance,7,3 February 2009,"Some say this is Dario Argento's masterpiece and that may well be true. I haven't seen all of his films, but this one certainly has a lot going for it. Few films can match it, in any genre, for cinematography. The lighting is superb and surreal, the use of geometric patterns amazing. There aren't that many death sequences, but the ones present are dynamic and disturbing. The initial murder has a dance student being stabbed multiple times before being pushed through in immense skylight to fall and be strangled by a cord. Unfortunately, the effects man has scant knowledge of the inner workings of the human being, otherwise he wouldn't have created an exposed heart for the killer to stab. However, that aside, the shots here are incredibly effective, and watch for the great shot of the second corpse on the floor among the tiles and broken glass. Argento cast Jessica Harper in the lead role. It's an excellent choice in terms of her physical beauty and childlike innocent staring, but once she starts talking, the character is marred. Harper sounds like a 38 year old woman in an 18 year old's body. View this for the colors, lighting, and repeated patterns, the long shots of empty corridors, and the building sense of dread. You will have to overlook the slipshod dubbing and the lackluster ending comes across like a wet fart. There is a cool nod to one of Argento's previous films, The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, in the final sequence. However, when we at last see the showdown between Jessica and ""The Directress,"" you can't help but feel let down. The scene is all too short and rather silly. Compared to the rest of the film, this seems very rushed. Don't let that dissuade you from a few viewings. Argento fully realizes how to utilize color to manipulate your mind. There are suspenseful moments(including one sequence that seems straight out of Saw), but no scares.",Suspiria
230,tjsdshpnd,Arty Slashing,8,21 July 2010,"There is a reason why Italian filmmaker Dario Argento is called the king of slasher and giallo movies. Not only has he revived them, but also has given them a new dimension. Suspiria is one of Argento's best creations. It is art-horror at it's best. I call it colorful brutality. We get scared after watching the victims throat get slashed but we also do not fail to appreciate the colorful & artful background where the victim was murdered. In Suspiria, the first murder itself makes us appreciate the genius of the filmmaker. It is one of the finest killing I have seen in cinema. Most of the movie takes place under one location - The ballet school and hence Argento has given special attention in creating its own separate personality. Background music is exceptional by Goblin.The one thing which I hated about the movie though was it's bad acting and terrible dubbing.But I am not aware if Argento movies are known for their good acting anyways. People watch them to see some throats get slashed. It surely is worth a watch.Rating : 8/10",Suspiria

232,Pedro-37,Another overrated Argento movie,6,12 January 2002,"Dario Argento is the film maker horror fans have picked out to find recognition among mainstream critics & film fans: His style is amazing, his choice of music remarkable, the atmosphere he creates genuinly creepy and the gore very well integrated into the story. However, Argento is not a good storyteller. In almost all the movies I've seen by him, I was either bored or confused by the story. ""Suspiria"" is one of the better ones on that account. It's considered a horror masterpiece, but while I do not agree with that, I appreciate certain scenes and definitely Argento's style.
The scene for example where the blind man walks on the piazza with his dog is perfect. It's scary, beautifully photographed and masterly edited. There are other sequences that stand out. But overall, I was still disappointed. It was the first movie I've seen by Argento. I didn't like it much the first time I've seen it (the uncut version by the way). Later, I've watched other Argento movies and returned to ""Suspiria"". I liked it more the second time around but finally decided that Argento is highly overrated and he is not my kind of film maker.

233,JohnnyPHreak,Atmospheric and colorfully shot supernatural slasher film,8,6 November 2014,"I have been waiting for the right time for my first viewing of Dario Argento's fan favorite Suspiria. When this Halloween Extravaganza came up I took at as the opportunity to finally sit down the the film. I had only heard praises of the film. I personally wanted to go in cold. When a movie is hyped up I hate being let down. It has happened to me in a few of the last movie viewings. I stayed away from reviews and the like. I know that this movie has been out since '77 but I will do heavy research. Going in cold was the best idea I had with this film. Jessica Harper stars as Suzy Bannion a newcomer to a prestigious ballet school where some grisly murders have occurred. As Suzy gets accustomed to the life at the school she realizes that there is more than meets the eye with the school and it's employees. I know the movie has been out long enough for there to be no need for a spoiler alert. But I wouldn't want to spoil any of the story because there is a slight twist ending. It fits very well with the story as a whole. Argento has done an excellent job of drowning this film in dread. From the opening to the credits there is an unease that grows slowly. The vivid look of the film doesn't help that unease go away. The use of color is apparent. It's an odd choice but works very well. The film feels much darker than sometimes what's on screen. But when it gets violent it gets ugly. There are some inventive shots on display for a film like this. More so than many films in this genre, this film has style for a slasher. It makes sense coming from who it was made by and the time period it was release. The body count is low but when someone dies on screen the aftermath is gory. It brings even more to the dread of the film. You just have no idea how or who are going to get it. When they do, it's not pretty. The soundtrack from Goblin is fantastic. It's an electronic score that takes a bit of getting use to but is put to great use in the film. It's especially effective during scene building tension. It's one of those soundtracks that's so good in a movie with a lesser caliber filmmaker it would have taken over the film.The performances are okay at best. For a film like this is more about the atmosphere, the setting, the soundtrack and the gore. They serve their characters well enough to keep the film moving. The story may start off thin but there is a deep back story that is revealed as the film goes on. I would love to see what happen to some of these characters to see how they got where they are. This is another one of those scary movies where you just don't trust kids. There was always something sinister about children in the 70's. Dario Argento created a fantastic film that help promote the slasher genre and the supernatural genre for years to come. There are plenty of films that this one has influenced. It is a hard balance when tackling two genres in one film but this one rides the line well.",Suspiria
234,theskulI42,Spectacular eye candy mostly supports plot less giallo.,8,13 November 2008,"Ah, the giallo. A subgenre so distinct it gets its own name. The origin is Italian, and the films are characterized by unsettling atmosphere, abrupt audio cuts, insane quick-zooms into random objects, and of course, lots of blood. There are three directors that can be referred to as something of a holy trinity of giallo: the Father, Mario Bava, the Son (Lucio Fulci), and he who must be the Holy Ghost, Dario Argento.Tonight, I consumed Argento's most famous film, Suspiria, the story of an American ballet dancer coming to study abroad at a prestigious academy in Italy. Almost immediately, strange things start happening. I'd go on, but that's literally all the plot we get. The tip on Argento is that he ""puts the 'gore' in 'gorgeous'"", and boy does this film ever deliver. The start of this film is not the story (watch the trailer, it has nothing to do with the film whatsoever), but the luscious, dazzling visuals. The opening sequence alone is such a sensory explosion; it has so many striking color schemes clashing with each other and somehow working that set decorators and cinematographers could study it for an entire semester. Almost never is naturalistic light utilized, and every scene is bathed in a different synthetic, supernatural light that the film manages to provide almost nothing of substance and still be extremely disquieting.Then suddenly a blind man is inexplicably murdered by his dog, and the film downshifts into a simultaneous combination infodump/slasher movie, as the mystery was made clear and the film started endlessly killing off cypherous side characters no one cared about. I was still interested in the film, but it was no longer the rapturous, offputting sensuality the film was pumping out by the gallon earlier on.Italian horror is one of the few areas of the film universe where I am still sorely lacking, so I'm glad to have seen another, and Suspiria was a clear improvement over my first Argento, his underwhelming, diffusive debut, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage. I've seen the handful of really big, famous, obvious ones now, but oddly enough, the best giallo I've seen BY FAR was the least heralded: Pupi Avati's marvelous The House with the Laughing Windows. So that's my hope for this review: If nothing else, I hope it intrigued you enough to see that excellent, underseen flick.

When I saw ""Deep Red"" recently, I really liked it, so I wondered why ""Suspiria"" hadn't made such an impression on me. Re-seeing again recently, I realized it was almost like a cake with too much frosting that hadn't been pared away so you had room to involve yourself: yeah, there's great this-that-and-the-other, but one finds oneself drifting off, inwardly, waiting for the next scene to take place, unmoored for a bit since you're denied the option of getting involved (or *room*, to rather!). None of this is to say the movie is trite, formulaic, full of the usual things, and not with the breathtaking visuals and the payoff of a close study of HItchcock (even in terms of how a person *falls* ... ). I guess it's just a luxury problem, really: Not a movie that dulls your intelligence but over-taxes it, the question I suppose of a filmmaker earlier on in their career whose a little predisposed to be fond of their own effects and abilities. I didn't dislike this movie at all, don't get me wrong, but I don't find myself vouching for it personally or having much affection for it. Like I said earlier, I liked ""Deep Red"" better.

Great visuals and a chilling score add more to the overall atmosphere of terror than what actually occurs on screen.  Not that there aren't some terrifying things to be seen.  After a brutal opening, the film settles down to mostly scenes of implied horror. Simple conversations are done in a foreboding manner and there is such an emphasis on primary colors that you are on edge, throughout the film.

237,azeemnavarro,The best Giallo film of all time,10,20 July 2019,"This is by far, Dario Argento's best movie, and it may be the best Italian horror movie, period.
If you're looking for an elaborate history with twists and great developed characters, Suspiria is not for you. The plot is the least important thing here, even unexisting for a portion of the runtime. This apparent weakness, is overcome by some of the greatest filmmaking of all time.
Beautifully shot, with bombastic colors, something you didn't seen in an horror movie back in the day. The amazing cinematography is best exemplified in the first killing scene, that is in my opinion one of the most memorable scenes in any movie.
Now that I have seen Suspiria both in the english and italian version, I can say that you can watch whatever version you want, the acting is great anyways. Jessica Harper performance is compelling, the innonce and naivety she gives to her character makes you care about her. Stefania Casini is good as Sara too, though I may say her death scene is disappointing.
The Goblin score is very well known. For some is great, for some people is bad. The first time that I saw Suspiria, I fouded it so annoying. With time, I came to appreciate it a lot more. I don't love it, but it fits so well with the style of the film that I can imagine different music in this.
I just love this movie, is style over substance done in the best possible way. Recommended for true horror fans.",Suspiria
238,EdYerkeRobins,Argento's Brilliant Atmosphere Vastly Improves a Simple Plot,8,12 April 2002,"Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" is regarded by many as a horror classic, and others as mindless drivel.  Having recently watched it, I've found that the film itself is rather simple, but is regarded as a classic because the brilliant atmosphere created by the direction and score is able to add suspense and character to what would otherwise be a bland, standard film.	The plot is surprisingly plain, perhaps because it's been rehashed many times before and since.  I usually don't prefer to do plot summary in my reviews, but ""Suspiria"" can be summed up in one sentence: a new girl at a renowned dance school discovers that strange supernatural murders are occurring that appear to be related to her teachers and headmasters. Perhaps the other reason this plot is so simple nowadays is that the concept of an occult evil occurring unknowingly ""under one's nose"" at a place with any fame, is ludicrous in light of today's tabloid media.  Although the plot should be and is for the most part executed well, there are still one or two holes, but there are also a lot of scenes that just seem really funny.  Not to mention occasionally the dubbing becomes a little too obvious.	That being said, the film is still intriguing because all of its other aspects are beautiful.  Argento presents the audience with his trademark macabre shots; although not very gory, killings and bodies are presented at viewpoints that are noticeably different than in American cinema (some still look cheesy because of their age, but others, such as the ""eyes in the window"" shot near the beginning, are very effective).   Argento is also brilliant at warping the concept of light as ""safe"" and ""good""; light is usually only shown as a predecessor to something terrible, making it seem rather evil.  Argento's effective use of darkness is at first distracting, but once adjusted to it adds incredibly to the sense of evil in the atmosphere.	The other piece that adds greatly to the film's eerie atmosphere is the score.  Composed by the band Goblin, it's one of the best soundtracks to ever grace horror cinema, and even cinema in general.  It gives Argento's imagery an even more haunting dream-like impression, and, similar to John Carpenter's famous ""Halloween"" theme, never fails to bring tension to a scene.	What ""Suspiria"" lacks plot wise in originality, it makes up for with style, and instead of ""style over substance"", the style works with and greatly improves upon its little substance.  Unfortunately, that style isn't readily appreciated by mainstream fans; even for those who do appreciate it, after over 25 years it's beginning to show signs of wearing thin (e.g. the scenes that are unintentionally funny).  However, Argento is still looked upon favorably as a ""Euro-horror"" innovator in the art-house/horror circles, however, and seeing ""Suspiria"", one of his more well-known pictures, it's obvious why.",Suspiria
239,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,"The strangest horror movie I have ever seen, and in the best way!",10,21 August 2020,"Tonight I watched Suspiria for the very first time and during the first 20 minutes or so I literally had no idea what I was watching. The movie has a strange way of using its music and how it decides to show what's happening on-screen. The movie at first felt like a cheap attempt to scare the audience, but oh man, Suspiria is anything but that!The design of the school and all of the lightning choices are all great. During the entire movie something just feels off, and that leads me into one of my huge positives: The atmosphere. This is by far one of the most unsettling and creepy movies ever made, and why is that? I'll try to break it down.As previously mentioned the design and lighting plays a big part in creating the atmosphere and so does the music/sounds played during the movie. A lot of scenes are strangely put together like this one scene where two characters are swimming in a pool and discussing something that happened earlier on. In the middle of this scene the camera switches to a new angle from above, almost like somebody or something is watching them.There's also a lot of violence and disturbing imagery throughout the film, and it still holds up for the most part. I won't go into details, but there is one scene near the very end that actually really disturbed me, which nearly no movie has succeeded with.My only real problem with the movie was some not so great acting from a couple of side characters, because it was pretty distracting. Everything else was great, though. A solid 8/10!",Suspiria

It's worse than anything Roger Corman has ever made. Just because this film director is from Italy doesn't mean it's ""art."" Yes, the film is dated as well (it's from the '70s), but this criticism is not based on that. If you want to watch a horror film and have a bunch of laughs at the movie's expense, this is the one.

Well, it does, in a way. Suspiria is much better than the average splatter because it combines gore with supernatural elements, has an effective soundtrack (the sound quality is another thing!) and is fast-paced (while in most thrillers the tension sequences are 10'-15' apart from each other, this one had me jump off my seat every other minute - not because I was scared, but rather nervous!). Don't look for great performances here - and don't ask too many questions : just prepare yourselves for some agony and enjoy this very good thriller from an era where computer effects in movie making were virtually unknown.8",Suspiria
243,cyberknight,"""The best"" doesn't mean ""good""",1,22 June 2017,"It's usually referred to as ""the best of Dario Argento"", a ""classic"". As far as Argento's films go, maybe people are right, it is his best work... Unfortunately, ""the best"" doesn't imply it's ""good"".Let's begin from the very beginning, the airport scene. The film is very colourful, even oversaturated for no reason in several scenes, e.g., the airport is red, all red, nothing but red...Most things happen for no reason, they just happen. E.g., one night, after some awful events, it starts raining maggots from the school's ceiling... They were just there, to fall on everybody's heads, just for yucky effect...In another scene, the camera goes running through the school's corridors to a side door (not too fast, so as to not scare people watching it), with an amazingly noisy cacophonous ""music"" playing, complete with a chorus of ""ae-ae-aeh""'s. I guess that was supposed to imply that an evil entity was getting out of the school, a powerful entity that can fly, but cannot walk through walls, or open windows, or fly faster...That same night, a guiding dog gets possessed by said evil entity and attacks its blind owner... I'm sorry for the dog, who had to eat some really though piece of beef for the scene, although the killing itself was played by a hand puppet... They could have, at least, put someone that knew how to manage a dog puppet to do it, as the way it was done, it showed clearly that it was a hand puppet...And then the new student finds out that the school was originally a witches covenant, burnt down and rebuilt as a dance school. Now she's starting to worry! After invading the powerful entity's resting place, the new student kills it, by stabbing it with a piece of glass decoration she stumbled onto. So much so for such a powerful entity...Aside from the story, which is very shallow (no one has a good reason to do anything in the plot, and usually no reason at all to do whatever they do), the film offers no scares. Part of that is because every time something scary is about to happen, the music becomes extra noisy (really noisy, the sound edition is the actual horror here, it's almost unbearable, I had to turn down the volume too many times while watching it). While musical cues are an interesting way of building up tension, e.g., 1975's actual classic ""Jaws"", it requires a lot of talent to make it work. The music must be good and perfectly timed with the action on screen. That doesn't happen in ""Suspiria"", the annoying cacophony just explodes overwhelmingly, regardless of what's going on (too many times, there is absolutely nothing happening, but the music just gets more annoying for no reason).""Suspiria"" means ""sigh"" in Latin languages. After watching it, I understood why. Nobody or nothing ever sighs in the film. No, but I sighed when the film simply ended and the credits started rolling. I was both frustrated, to have spent so much time watching this too hyped film, and happy, because the boredom ordeal was finally over.",Suspiria
244,eytand94,Suspiria: Gore+Atmosphere=A Masterpiece!,10,27 November 2009,"From the mind of Italian horror maestro Dario Argento, director of ""Phenomena,"" ""Deep Red,"" and ""Tenebre,"" comes his most famous work, 1977's ""Suspiria,"" a wonderful horror film that is unique, scary, and absolutely gore-ific! Jessica Harper stars as Suzy Bannyon, an American ballet student who has come to Europe to study at the greatest dance school in the area. But right from the start, nothing of good nature is going on and Suzy becomes more vulnerable to the ominous environment in which she has entered. And while strange things happen in the school, outside, people involved are horrifically murdered. Who or what is the culprit of these eerie occurrences? And will Suzy find out what is going on? ""Suspiria's"" plot is a little bit hard to follow. At one time are we are we given a hint as to what is going on, but it doesn't matter. This movie is scary! Not only is the film extremely creepy and filled with ""BOO!"" scares, but it shows what Dario Argento is known best for: his uncontrollable use of on-screen gore! Argento's murder sequences are a cut above most slasher movies because all of Argento's characters die in creative and surprisingly beautiful ways. Each kill is filmed with lavish colors ranging from blue to orange in the background. And the blood that flows is so red. And all of the murders are shameless and right in your face, always making the viewer extremely on edge.Even though it gains points for being ""gore-gous,"" as director Eli Roth describes, ""Suspiria"" is a lot more than just a slasher movie. It's quite frightening. A lot of the movie is shot in the dark, and Argento constantly makes sure that you're never far away from a good ""BOO!"" The movie is deeply atmospheric, almost like a very mature fairy tale. We are thrown into a nightmare that leaves you on the edge of your seat. People get very uncomfortable while watching ""Suspiria,"" just like I did when I first saw it.Jessica Harper is very good as Suzy. She shows a sign of vulnerability that is believable and sympathetic. The rest of the cast also give jobs well-done, especially Stefania Casini as Sarah, Joan Bennett as Madame Blanc and Alida Valli as Ms. Tanner.Dario Argento has said that he got the inspiration from ""Suspiria"" from Walt Disney's ""Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs,"" and it shows. Alan Jones has called the film ""a Walt Disney-style horror movie."" Only Walt Disney would never be this ferociously creepy. The first time I saw ""Suspiria,"" I was very entertained and creeped out, and that reaction remains the same each time I watched it. It's a classic horror movie that deserves the status, and I recommend it to all horror fans. A must! ""The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 92!""",Suspiria

246,Nigel St. Buggering,Someone please explain this phenomenon,4,1 May 2002,"For pretentious horror fans the world over, Italian horror in general, and Argento in particular, has become some sort of gold standard by which horror films are measured.  Having now viewed several in the interest of completeness, I must conclude that horror fans will praise anything if it happens to be foreign.Thus far, these viewing experiments have yielded extreme silliness; only ""Dellamorte Dellamore"" and ""Phenomena"" have even begun to live up to their reputations, in my opinion.  ""Suspiria"" is one of the worst of the bunch, as it appears that such concepts as story construction, plot logic, and character motivation are as much a mystery to the writer as the plot is to the heroine.While there are many atmospheric moments here, they are essentially built around nothing.  Such terrifying moments of realization such as ""the directress isn't really out of town"" and ""the teachers all leave at night"" fail to drum up much tension, despite the desperate whisperings of characters who come off as paranoid schizophrenics in their histrionics over next to nothing.Not to give anything away (spoiler alert), but how is it that a coven which has existed for over a hundred years is so easily felled by a single ditzy dance student?  Was no one else in history Einstein enough to put it all together before now?  Why is the directress, who has her own hidden chamber, sleeping in a temporary dorm room on the other side of a sheet from the students?  Why is a coven of witches running what appears to be a legitimate dance academy, even going so far as to recruit students from overseas?The film seems sadly uninterested in answering any of these questions, thus winding up as a singularly unsatisfying experience.  If this is what true horror fans consider the holy grail of horror cinema, then I am happy not to be counted among their number.",Suspiria
247,UnderworldRocks,Not scary,2,19 August 2016,"Saw the movie today but did not find it scary at all. The blood looks so fake. Perhaps it is forgivable considering that the film was released in 1977. But wait! Alien was released in 1979 and the blood looks realistic. By the way, everything looks realistic in that film. This film pales in comparison, in terms of blood.The supposed-to-be-bad-ass witch got killed pretty easily. By the way, the film is not exactly subtle when it comes to portraying the witch. The witch's ugliness is on full display. Speaking of subtlety, there is a really bad-ass witch in Blair Witch Project. In that movie the scary witch barely shows its face but still manages to take my breath away.This movie makes me feel disappointed and sleepy.

250,DrPhibes1964,Beautiful But Dumb,5,2 January 2021,"I have been watching horror films since the early 70's and learned not to apply to much logic into what I was watching, allowing the the absurdities and illogical aspects to be set aside. If a film created a reasonably plausible atmosphere within its own cinematic universe I tried not to get overly analytical about it. I doubt many horror films can stand up to much scrutiny before falling apart. But Suspiria is a strange animal. I vividly remember the ads for the film playing on late-night tv and scaring the hell out of me, employing no images from the film. I had heard how scary it was for decades before finally having the opportunity to actually see it, and, like The Exorcist, it did not exactly live up to the hype surrounding it. Suspiria is a series of interesting set pieces stitched together by a razor blade thin plot which makes absolutely no sense . It becomes more a frustrating experience because we are given so little information. I have seen only a few Dario Argento films and noticed a common thread that they tend to feature women being butchered in variously gruesome fashion. The plot and characters are an after thought as they seem to be designed to satiate the gory appetite of its target audience. It is not clever or inventive, and at its heart is nothing more of a slasher flick with vague supernatural overtones. But it is admittedly one of the most beautiful horror films ever made. I believe I read somewhere that Argento bought all the Technicolor film that he could find. The colours are vivid and aggressive throughout, primary colours just jumping off the screen. I will fault the film on its visual style. I just wish there was a stronger story. It's just downright dumb some of the things we must accept and cannot help but become silly, thus sabotaging whatever mood they were attempting to create. The single dumbest moment involves a room filled with barbed wire. My eyes rolled up so far that I was just about staring at the back of my skull. The actors, for the most part, were good, especially Jessica Harper who is a little bit more than the average ""scream queen"" that populate horror films of the latter 20th century. The music by Goblin becomes a character, pummelling the viewer to make the film a true sensory overload. To some this is a classic of the genre, but for me it is a near miss. It had potential to be great but it gets swept away by its own style and forgot to pack a plot. Perhaps that is enough for some but I require a bit more meat on the bones to make for a satisfying experience.",Suspiria
251,varun_120,Good film but for totally different reason,8,24 October 2014,"When I read so many good reviews about Suspiria that it is one of the best horror flicks, then I thought I should give it a try. I watched the film, and it was good. But it was very far from scary. It was kind of a scary films for kids, just like the colorful nightmares we think of kids.Sometimes it was funny too. Actually I found this film funnier, thus rated it highly. For me it was more comical than horror. The dialogues make little sense, acting is so so. but, the background score was awesome. It was very catchy and really keeps you hooked.Dario Argento also used colors brilliantly in this film. The color of blood (looks totally fake, but dome deliberately I reckon), to the color of mansion where the dance academy is, that really captivates you.I found this film great for being funny and weird, but not for horror. So, I give this film 8/10.""She must die, die die"" HaHa..",Suspiria
252,Zod-2,Not that scary,5,27 October 2003,"This review contains minor spoilers.Suspiria is a movie with potential.  It does have it's scary moments but the surrounding story is quite dull and you'll find yourself wishing the director (Dario Argento) would put more scares in the film.  The film has 3 good moments too it, one at the beginning, middle and the all too brief end. The movies main problem is that there isn't much plot to hold the ""scare"" scenes together.  Had the main character actually investigated the strange goings on then perhaps the movie would have been more interesting as she found clues to the schools secret.  The problem is that all of the investigating has already been done for her and it is just a matter of time before she is told all she needs to know.  The telling isn't very interesting and you wonder how the information was gathered in the first place.  To top it off there aren't many strange happenings going on anyway (that the viewer sees) so you have to wonder why an investigation takes place at all.  So in the end that viewer just has to take it for granted that strange occurrences have been happening at the school for awhile.On the good side the film does have an interesting musical score although it tends to get in the way of actually being able to hear important noises and pieces of dialogue in the movie, but it is creepy so serves it's purpose. Argento's use of the camera is interesting but not enough to save an otherwise dull film.A better revelation of what is going on at the school might have increased the suspense level.  By the time Argento gets around to said revelation the film is almost over and everything is wrapped up quite quickly.Overall Suspiria has a few good moments but lacks in story.  It's a fine idea for a horror film but it's story matter is wasted.  You'll find yourself asking many ""why"" questions and getting very few ""because"" answers. Suspiria looks good, sounds good, and has some shocks...but in the long run you'll probably be bored.  Suspiria ranks a 5 out of 10.",Suspiria

It checks all of these weird, unconventional boxes you didn't know you were looking for. The acting is poor and the plot is average at best. However, the soundtrack constantly warning you some weird twists are about to happen is unmatchable. The color symbolism is out of this world.

254,guskeller,Visually unique,8,20 October 2021,"The original Suspiria is a cult classic because it is visually unique. Most noticeable is its extremely stylized lighting. In almost every shot, there are dramatic waves of red, blue or green washing over the screen. This vibrant approach extends to the setting as well, with rich red hallways and colorful stained glass windows. Meanwhile, this is all presented with intriguing shot choices, camera movements, and edits. Another predominate strength of Suspiria is its soundtrack. Hypnotic and frightening, the music sets the perfect mood and ties everything together.However, as artistic as Suspiria is, there are qualities that don't translate. The sound design is interesting but distracting because it's entirely re-recorded in post-production. The acting is occasionally overdramatic. Yet, the writing is the biggest detriment. The story is plain and the characters are muddled (some serving no purpose). The exposition dump is blunt. Plus, the ending is abrupt, lacking any falling action or payoff. None of this is necessarily unforgivable, but it holds the film back from being a universal hit. Ultimately, Suspiria is an aesthetic ride that will enthrall artsy crowds but may be too bizarre to completely connect with broader audiences.Writing: 6/10

258,theskylabadventure,"Tell me Suzy, do you know anything about witches...?",9,2 July 2015,"Suspiria is one of the undisputed classics of horror cinema, and certainly one of the very best horror movies ever to come out of Europe. Argento will probably always be a divisive figure. For all of his talents as a stylist, all of his movies (as much as I love them) are let down by tired pacing, ludicrous plots, hackneyed dialogue and pathetic characterisations. In short, if you're looking for cerebral, rather than purely visceral, look elsewhere.The main reason Suspiria was and still is able to stand out from the rest of Argento's oeuvre is that, for the first time, his focus was on the supernatural, rather than on some implausible and clumsily conceived murder mystery. The dialogue is still hammy and the characters – especially the woeful lead, Jessica Harper, who has about as much charisma as my grandmother's socks – are all pretty slender (pun intended), but the plot actually moves along well and the supernatural undercurrent gives Argento completely free reign to indulge his visualistic flair like never before (or since). Subtle it is not, but it sure is effective. The colour palette is gorgeous and the production design (note the height of the door handles) is eerily effective in setting the demented fairy-tale-gone-wrong tone. The death set pieces are among the best Argento devised (I cannot look at razor wire without wincing), their strength, as with all Argento deaths, being the fact that they're so connectible to the type of pain we can all imagine and we all dread. And, of course, there's the now-classic Goblin score which, however bombastically it is sometimes deployed, takes the tension up ten-fold.We can only hope that the long-circulated rumours of a remake remain unfounded.",Suspiria
259,Tobeshadow,Red-blooded!,8,30 October 2021,"Suspiria is an absolute gem in the horror film genre, demonstrating Dario Argento's mastery of both camera and storytelling. The score by The Goblins is magnificent, instantly giving the film a sense of foreboding dread and menace, and the instrumentation manages to sound futuristic yet also invokes something more primordial.Perhaps the most striking element of the film is the use of super rich colours that really jump off the screen. This instils the film with a dream/nightmare like quality and creates an unforgettable mood.",Suspiria
260,scarecrowman,"Beautiful, Haunting, and Enchanting! Argento's Horror Masterpiece!",10,22 April 2003,"I love Dario Argento's work.  I caught onto him only a few years ago. However his film Tenebre is among my favorites along with Profondo Roso and this one Suspiria.  The typical horror fan may never understand this film, just as a typical film fan may not either.  I have heard so many people make fun of the over dramatic sequences in the film.  I have heard a lot about the color of the blood.  I have heard even more about the eyes in the window.  So many people have lost their ability to think in an abstract sense that the world's art has gone to dung over the years. In Suspiria, Argento paints a picture.  He has been the only person who has been able to put on film the way we all see things when we are afraid. When we are afraid we do not pay attention to the details simply because we are in a euphoric state of mind.  Fear is the greatest boost of adrenaline anyone can receive.  Fear unto itself is like a drug, it can give us a very abnormal view on our surroundings.  Don't you remember the shadows of your teddy bears when you were children, becoming monsters?  Don't you remember seeing things that could never possibly move do the impossible?  That is the abstract idea of the famous words ""There is nothing to fear but fear itself.""  The point is when we are afraid our minds become playgrounds for extreme paranoia to the point of delusion.  You can scare yourself with your mind more than any person can.   That being said, although nobody will ever truly capture fear, and make you feel the same fear; Dario Argento has found a way for us to explore the beauty and ugliness of fear.  Thus far, he has been the only director in film history to scratch the surface in capturing the essence of true fear. Suspiria is the film that displays it better than any other film.  If you like Suspiria check out all of Argento's work.  Argento is thus far, the only director to have never disappointed me.  Hopefully anyone new to Argento will feel the same.  Warning however, cynics need to stay away from this film.  While there are many spots in this film that can come off to non-abstract thinkers, (You know who you are, people who like the box office hits, and Academy award winners), poking fun at this film will only make you seem more ignorant than you probably are.  If you don't get it don't poke at it, just go watch Jaws, Psycho, or Scream and everything will be ok.

The only compliment that I can give 'Suspiria' is the fact that when it comes to visual style it's a ""REAL"" knockout in terms of Argento's abstract look at the World presenting us with more of a ""twilight zone"" vision.My only complaint though was the fact that it wasn't so spooky as I'd come to expect, though film's opening murder is the best part. It's not surprising to know where fellow ""giallo"" directors (giallo meaning the color of yellow for fear) like Lucio Fulci and Lamberto Bava drew their inspirations from with films like 'The Beyond', 'A Blade in the Dark and 'Demons' with opening shots, gore scenes and haunting scores incorporated within these other works of horror.Overall a stylish film with some amazing camera work and creepy settings, letdown slightly with a somewhat awkward ending.8/10",Suspiria

The gore is minimum but there are some very gruesome scenes in the movie. I think the only thing that holds me back from calling ""Suspiria"" a masterpiece is the acting, and that fact that no one character stood out in the movie.

Intense, suspenseful, and visually rewarding, Suspiria has carved out a name for itself as the greatest of the Italian shockers, and one of the best horror films of all time. But for the sake of argument, let's presume that some of you may have only just heard of the film, or may actually be interested in what I have to say about it.Suspiria is the story of Suzy Banyon, who arrives at a European ballet academy and is immediately thrust into a series of bizarre and horrific events. Her increasing suspicion of the staff and instructors drive her to discover the cause of a string of gruesome deaths and mysterious disappearances, and eventually she must confront the dark secret behind the founding of the school. The plot twists and turns in a delightfully sadistic fashion, and maintains a high degree of tension throughout the film.But all that takes a back seat to the gorgeous cinematography and superb art direction. Lush, oversaturated colors constantly wash the screen, creating a literal spectrum of emotion, muting themselves only as we approach the final scenes, where their loss only adds to the tension of the climax.Add in a compelling Goblins soundtrack, a heaping handful of Dario Argento's beloved maggots, and two of the most horrifying deaths in cinema history, and you have the makings of a horror classic. If you haven't seen Suspiria, you must, immediately. Just make sure you get a good print - wouldn't want you to miss out on any of that fabulous Technicolor.",Suspiria
266,Ivan Ravenous,Amazing!,9,13 January 2001,"Suspiria is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I just watched it aboot 10 minutes ago with a friend, and he told me afterwards that he was trembling through the whole thing. Argento is a genius, and this film is a masterpiece. If you're a serious fan of horror or films in general, Suspiria is a must.",Suspiria
267,ClarusTheDogCow,Unique,7,5 July 2003,"Suspiria is in a league of its own.  Dario Argento truly has the artistic directing skill to make environments look scary with use of vivid colors and different camera angles.  I love how the movie uses dark reds and greens to accentuate the rooms. 
The architecture of the dance academy is impressive on its own.  I have never been to Europe but I would love to see the building designs if there are anything like they were in the movie.The special effects, for todays standard, are pretty outdated but I can easily see how this would be so scary in the late 70s.  Most horror movies today (especially produced by American Hollywood) just slap the evil demon together with CGI effects and don't actually use any skill in creating scary moments.7/10 for horror genre.",Suspiria
268,Dave Godin,Over long and over rated,4,6 January 2002,"It's difficult to know quite what to make of SUSPIRIA, a film that meanders all over the place as it tries to emulate Hitchcock's skill at creating suspenseful situations. Trouble is, the whole thing is over-egged. A relentlessly monotonous six-note musical soundtrack by The Goblins, plus unremitting screaming from various females, might well give some the creeps, but in between, there are longeurs of endless creeping down corridors, the usual lights suddenly failing in frequent thunderstorms, and of course the majority of exterior scenes are accompanied by torrential downpours of rain. A few set pieces are well done, (for those who have a taste for gruesome mutilations), and it must be said that Jessica Harper acquits herself well as the American student forever glancing around to see what mischief is likely to befall next, but poor Joan Bennett I'm afraid comes across as a role-model for Divine, and Alida Valli seems to think she's really on the set of ILSA, SHE-WOLF OF THE S. S. I don't know if it was intentional, or if it was meant to be read the way I read it, but in the final shot as the Academy is consumed by flames and Jessica Harper walks away to safety, a smile of deepest satisfaction appears on her face which at the same time also seems to be a smirk of profound relief that at last it's all over. I felt much the same way.",Suspiria
269,Shinwa,Still scary the tenth time,8,10 November 1998,"Since I've seen this movie enough times now to make a solid judgment on it, I have to admit that it falls a little flat sometimes, has a tin ear for dubbed dialogue, and doesn't make one tiny fragment of sense. But who really cares? This movie is so creatively made in every technical sense--cinematography, sets, soundtrack--that despite its other failings, it still is more solidly entertaining than most any other horror film I can think of off-hand. It can't really live up to its first murder set piece, but, then, few movies could, and this is one of the few movies I can watch repeatedly and not get bored with. As Argento films go, it is the most seen if perhaps not the best, and anyone with more familiarity with his idiosyncrasies is more likely to forgive the lapses in logic. Don't even bother seeing it if it's not in widescreen format, though.",Suspiria
270,zanghi_james,Suspiria is incredible! Tremble! Tremble!,9,13 October 2021,"As usual, I watched the remake before I watched the original. I know, very bad of me. (Though I personally enjoyed the Prime Video Suspiria remake.)Now I have watched Dario Argento's Suspiria. It lives up to the hype. Jessica Harper, who plays Suzy Bannion, is so beautiful and innocent-looking and kind of makes me think of Nancy Drew in a Gothic Horror film. The music by Claudio Simonetti and the band Goblin and the other sound effects created for this movie is the clincher, though, along with the amazing use of color that Argento utilizes. The vibrant colors, the haunting lullaby-like score, it's so mesmerizing yet not distracting from the story.My only problem with the film was the abrupt and open ending. Nowadays, you would probably have to have a little more resolution to the story in regards to what happened afterwards.Stay Scared!",Suspiria
271,ArdentViewer,The Real Horror is in the Lack Thereof,5,28 November 2020,"It's tricky to view iconic films for the first time from a modern lens. It's hard to say how I would have interpreted the film during its era. However, having grown up with late 90s/2000s horror movies, I view this film as lacking in comparison.Visually, the film was stunning and interesting - which is why I rated it 5/10 and not lower. I enjoyed the interior design of the buildings and the use of color - the overall atmosphere was excellent. The score was also good. However, these aspects could not make up for the over-acting, unrealistic dialogue, terrible special effects, and weak plot.All of the acting was over the top and not believable. I realize that some of my displeasure may be related to the apparent dubbing of all language, but whatever the reason, it didn't work. The dialogue was contrived and forced. There was no character development and therefore no reason to care about the characters and their fates.I kept waiting to be scared. At most, I was at times uncomfortable. I was really disappointed with the rudimentary special effects - fake blood looked exactly like paint (color and consistency were way off), fake bat that looked like a puppet, fake dog biting a fake throat. Nothing approached realism. I'm not sure how the effects would have been interpreted in 1977, so perhaps that's unfair, but c'est la vie. I was relieved when the film ended.I wanted to watch the original before the remake so I could compare. Considering how beloved the original appears to be and the criticism I've seen of the remake, I don't have high expectations, but it may surprise me in a good way.",Suspiria
272,Anttell,Chills down the spine,9,13 November 2018,"I have to apologize to the film gods for not seeing this until now. Suspiria's every shot is like a devilish painting and the hissing soundtrack composed by Goblin goes straight into my favorites. A really really atmospheric film, the italian dubbing is icing on the cake. Some will probably take the film literally, some as mental breakdowns and hallucinations of witchcraft - the ambiguousness is what eventually makes Suspiria great (ala Rosemary's Baby). Marvellous stuff.Rating: 9/10",Suspiria
273,sjwest,And Momma Said 'Please Don't Be A Serial Murderer'  So I Became A Director Instead.,8,18 January 2004,"The horror genre can range from the sublime to the ridiculous. This is especially true of the late Seventies, early Eighties where slasher movies had some mainstream acceptance. Moviemakers sometimes strived to deliver the blood without much thought to anything else. So where does Suspiria' fit into this  sublime or ridiculous? When the movie is given some serious thought, the answer is not quite as simple as one would have thought it should have been. This is largely due to Dario Argento  a well-known figure in horror. His complexities of character overrun this movie as he instinctively performs his task of directing. Below I shall outline some of the salient factors within the fabric of his foremost creation, which give it its place in the horror genre.The first thing that strikes you is Argento's use of images and sound to create atmosphere. This is seen from the outset where Suzy arrives at the airport into a downpour with creepy music as a backdrop. She has now entered the world of the unnatural - unnatural evil. It is the lair of a dark foreboding force waiting for the next victim. The conditions are cold and the people even colder. We also see close-ups of water pouring down drains, something that is used throughout the movie as he attempts to create an illusion of the bloodletting and loss of life.Even more striking is the architectural settings that are used. It is like Old Europe meeting Picasso and it is quite breathtaking. This is a signature of almost every Italian directed film that I've seen. It was evident in The Ninth Gate' thus accentuating the illusion of book readers having refined tastes and in Dracula' to give an indication of the ancient, dark evil that he is. The advantage here is that the story is easier to become engrossed in. The senses are fully engaged as the settings add real value to the storyline. Another world is created and we are not put off by realistic settings that can jolt you from the story.The use of lighting is strongly emphasised by other users here and quite rightly so. Not only does it reflect the evil personality of the clan, but it also gives evil life to the dwellings. There was deliberate intent here that is proven by the death of the Black Queen, which causes the school to explode. This is a clever tactic since the majestic settings' thoroughly engages the imagination and our heroine is not only against the shapeshifting entities, but the whole complex itself. If we go to a place of splendour, we can feel the vibe that it gives  it seems to have a life of it's own - and the shrewd camera technique takes full advantage of this.The setting for the blind mans demise is a perfect example of this. The courtyard has an effect of foreboding power and when alone you could feel overwhelmed by the magnanimous aura. This effect is fully exploited by Argento. The sense of ever-present evil is also created by the set where they go to sleep away from the maggots. The blood  red lighting that awash the sheets and walls is indicative of the intent of the not only of the horde, but of the school building. This setting becomes all the more macabre when we learn of the Directresses (The Black Queen) presence.On the subject of the blind mans demise, it is also where one of the weak points of the movie is evident. The effects stand out as very weak to an audience used to high  tech CGI. This will be a problem for most movies of this time period as advancements create realistic effects. We can easily see the fake blood and the mannequin. Even though the scene stands out as a truly gruesome murder scene, an Argento signature, this will diminish with time, as effects become more seamless.      One thing that is inescapable here, is the deep  set misogynist element. This is overwhelmingly evident in the first and third murder scene where the victims suffering is drawn out and vicious at the same time. In the first one she is methodically and brutally stabbed instead of an all out knife assault which would have resulted in a quicker death. Argento even uses his own arm in these scenes to deliver the lethal blows. A slow death is the worst kind of death and that is meticulously planned here. As if this was not enough, she is hung for all to see with another woman creatively impaled below.In the third murder scene, the woman seems to seductively ensnare herself in the barbed wire thus causing more suffering. Indeed Argento's complex personality is laid to bear in scenes like this. Also one of the witches conjures up an image of a Frau Blitzen who teased the weak boys at physical training class.      As a lead - up to the first murder scene another shrewd ploy was used and that is of the presence at the window. The sensation of a presence draws in the frightened woman who looks but then draws away. But her curiosity gets the better of her as she is now driven by her fears  a fear not uncommon to many members of the audience. The hanging clothes block her vision accentuating the effect of something hiding. Suddenly she is attacked through the window and the vicious assault begins. This scene with the assistance of surreal music and a room visually vibrant is one that will stay long with the audience.Another camera trick used has its roots in Edgar Allan Poe. The wine glass is lifted to the camera as if we were drinking. This is an attempt to instil us in Argento's symphony of terror  much like Poe used to do.Italians seem to lay their souls to bare for their chosen art form. Perhaps a part of the emotive make  up as they draw on all their senses to deliver a product to satisfy their particular artistic tastes. This is fortunate for movie fans. The camera work, lighting and music have already been mentioned, but sometimes this will not do when the required effect is necessary. In the first murder scene, an animal heart is stabbed. In the third murder scene, it looks like a chicken breast is being slashed in order to simulate a throat being cut. These attempts did not go unnoticed and do take the already gruesome scenes to another level, even if we can tell what has been done.The story is not particularly of note, although I do not believe it is as weak as some say. The climatic scene builds up quite nicely as the heroine is given an insurmountable task, that is, to kill the Black Queen in her own lair. But she delivers one strike and as she perishes, the evil complex starts to disintegrate. For a movie that made its name out of scenes, it should not be the climax that is the let down. For everything to end in thirty seconds certainly went against the grain of the movie.Where exactly this movie fits was not easily determined. But it was the creative use of sets, lighting and sound that ultimately elevates this movie above most in the genre. Any true horror must have this in collection. Cheap thrills were not the norm here as we are spellbindingly drawn into a wicked, cruel world of parasitic witches drawing their evil power from the weak and unwitting. Although there is ominous motivations in the make  up of some scenes, there is no doubting Argento's talent and the contribution he has made to the genre. While you are reading this, I am probably searching for Tenebre'. I believe that there is an axe murder scene like no other. If Picasso did murder, perhaps it would be something like this.",Suspiria
274,mister_pig,One very bizarre fairy tale!,9,12 June 2003,"Dario Argento is hard for me to figure out. In this movie he has a fairly good cast, great visuals, and some of the most brutal murder scenes ever. While I really like this movie, I'm still not sure how I feel about Dario. He's really hit or miss in his style. Suspiria is great but if you see it and love it, don't rush out and buy his whole catalog expecting more films of this caliber.The whole movie is highly stylized, and the visual feeling he creates are stunning. A lot of red and blue lighting keeps the atmosphere going, and give it that world of witches feel. Some of the dialogue is really cheesy, but you should know going into an Italian horror movie that there are some concessions that have to be made in order to truly appreciate it.I go back and watch this one frequently, and I would recommend it to all serious horror fans. Casual fans should stay away though due to its extremely graphic content. If you like this one and want to see what else Argento can do, see 'Tenebrae' and 'Deep Red'. Most of his others are for completists only.One final thing I will say about Dario is that, while a lot of his catalog is trash, he's way more talented than most of his counterparts such as Lucio Fulci.9 out of 10",Suspiria
275,kayrannells,Creepy Witch Film,9,1 November 2020,"Widely considered to be Dario Argento's masterpiece, Suspiria is light on plot and nuanced characterizations, but heavy on mood, style, and gruesome death sequences.

276,Zebb67,One of the All-Time Horror Classics,10,11 August 2014,"From the bright colors that almost seem to bleed off the screen to the expert direction and pounding electronic score, Suspiria is without doubt one of the true masterpieces of horror, up there with Night of the Living Dead, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Rosemary's Baby. It has the feel and aesthetic of a nightmare, meaning the images may not always make sense but they are frightening nonetheless. Argento's career went into real decline over the past two decades, but if he only made this one film he would rightly still be called a great artist. Best seen on the big screen or at least a large-screen television so the images better come alive. Even non horror fans can appreciate the great look and sound of the film.",Suspiria

So it could be a common elements of those movies.The way people are killed is unique, and with the effects they had available quite gruesome, and reasonably realistic. The first murder sequence being the particular stand out.The story is quite uneven and some set pieces require a rather open mind, especially a scene involving some razor wire.

While I was watching this I was completely baffled as to how on Earth it achieved those high ratings. To me it had only TV movie quality. The interior set looked like what you would find in a high school play. The loud near ear-splitting sound through numerous areas of the movie served as a great distraction to where it was difficult to even pay attention to what was going on during those scenes. Why ?? It was extremely predictable, as I have seen a number of movies in the 60s and earlier seventies that told the very same type of story. I don't understand the hype. Maybe if I had seen it when I was a young child it would have left a greater impression? Again I ask the question, why???",Suspiria
279,gravity3,Could This Be the Most Beautiful Horror film?,7,1 July 2004,"Suspiria is the eye candy of all horror flicks. It might have the most beautiful set and light design I've seen in this genre - ever. Director Dario Argento is kind of a Tim Burton of the horror genre, giving us a completely unique and visually stunning vision of what other directors would leave as gray shadows and dull props. I guess there's the idea of lighting films in a ""realistic"" manner. But in the horror genre, that seems a little silly since the story lines deal with mostly impossible situations and characters anyway. In some ways - and this is a compliment - the look of this film reminds of me of the original ""STAR TREK"" TV series, for all it's use of bright color and over-the-top sets. Argento takes it orders of magnitude higher, however, and gives us images that could be taken as stills, framed and displayed in art galleries.SUSPIRIA is not a perfect film by any means, but I believe many fans of this film and its director are won over by the look of it all. And I completely understand that. Where this movie fell short in my viewing was in problems with pacing and storyline. It's great that Argento gave us some nice establishing shots and wide shots of where all the mayhem takes place, but sometimes it seems to linger there too long, and return too often. This coupled with the sometimes confusing order of information we're given (I'd wished we'd gotten things a little earlier or later in places) made the whole feel less than it should have been. And there is a moment or two where the special effects get a bit cheesy by today's standards. I think these moments are magnified by the contrast of how good everything else looks, so it's unfortunate, but probably unavoidable for the day.At this point I also must bring up the issue of gore in the horror genre. There seem to be 2 camps on this subject: those that want to see everything in great detail, and those that believe that less is more, and leaving things to the imagination can often be more powerful and effective (I sight JAWS on this issue - we only see one full-on shark attack, and that's at the end - all others are offscreen or have an obscured view, and it's one of the scariest movies ever made). I'm in the second group, so I must say I found certain gore aspects to be overdone, often to the point of trivializing the event. But I'm sure those who like gore in their horror will like SUSPIRIA's content even more. For those who can't handle it at all, however, this might not be your cup of tea. For the rest of you horror fans, even with the plot and pacing issues, SUSPIRIA is one to see at least once. I wish half of the horror films I've seen looked half as good as this one.",Suspiria

Argento's later films may be more thematically and narratively complex, but Suspiria still retains a primal power which is missing from his later films.

The cinematography, use of imbibition colors makes this movie *eye-catching*The Bad - Color is the only praise worthy aspect of this movie.

285,grahamcarter-1,As Good As It Gets,10,11 May 2017,"After the international success of Deep Red, Argento was again tired of making 'Giallo.' ""Suspiria"" marked his first foray into the realm of the supernatural. Argento's deliriously artificial horror film owes a debt to German Expressionism and Grimm fairy tales. Having traveled through the geographical 'magic' point where Switzerland, France, and Germany meet, Argento became interested in the Austrian-born Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). His Waldorf schools had been attacked for teaching occult practices disguised as arts-based education. Co-writer Daria Nicolodi had become interested in various fairy tales such as 'Alice in Wonderland,' 'Bluebeard,''Pinocchio,' and 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.' The title and general concept of 'The Three Mothers' came from 'Suspiria de Profundis' (Sighs from the Depths) (1845), a collection of essays written by Thomas De Quincey ('Confessions of an Opium Eater,' 1822). Fritz Lang's The Secret Beyond the Door (1947), was also a source of inspiration. A Freudian interpretation of the Bluebeard fairy tale, Suspiria borrows more from it than the actress Joan Bennett.Ballet student Suzy Banyon travels to a prestigious dance academy in Germany, only to discover that it is controlled by a coven of witches. The film begins with a repetitive chimes and bell melody fading in and out, suggesting that as Suzy exits the airport doors to the Black Forrest she is like a ballerina leaving the safety of its music box. Arriving at the 'Tanzakademie,' Suzy witnesses Pat terrified and running away from the school, and Suzy is told to leave by a girl on the intercom. Pat stays the night in a building that is fantastic in design; modeled after Escher's 'Sky and Water' (1938), the walls evoke Argento's obsession with sight and sightlessness. Dark/light, mobility/immobility are implied as Pat is drawn to the window and hung from an electrical wire, violently thrust through a stained glass ceiling, falling glass slicing her friend to death. The shattered glass, Pat's dangling corpse and her dribbling blood become operatic elements of the building's already 'phenomenal' artificiality.Suzy is propelled to the 'tri-chedelic' terror of the Academy, a colourful Alice's rabbit hole. The students, with the exception of Sara, are all petty and cruel bringing to mind Cinderella's evil stepsisters. The film's visual palette directs a journey of reds, yellows, and blues and like Snow White, Suzy has left the comfort of home for the misleading solace of a dwelling in the woods. As with Snow White's poisoned apple her wine is spiked, and walking the school's hallways Suzy seems frozen in time, overwhelmed by glowing dust particles and blinded by reflected light.Argento references Lang and Secret Beyond the Door with the trick of the higher than usual positioning of door handles, which serve to emphasise the youth and stature of the film's characters in relation to their grotesquely imposing doll house. A salute to the fairy-tale world of Val Lewton and Jaques Tourneur is present in the swimming pool scene, borrowed from Cat People (1942).Leading up to one of Suspiria's great set pieces, the Tanzakademie's blind pianist Daniel is fired after his seeing eye dog is accused of taking a bite out of Madame Blanc's young blond-haired nephew. Whether it intentionally attacked the child is beside the point, as supernatural forces are clearly commanding the dog when it lunges at its masters' throat. The camera takes on the POV of a flying demon in a deserted plaza, and though the helpless and blind Daniel senses evil, he cannot see the shadowy figures hovering above the plaza's main building.Suspiria became one of Argento's most successful films, receiving critical acclaim for its visual and stylistic flair, use of vibrant colours and its soundtrack. Argento would arguably never be as consistently good again.",Suspiria

The result of this new version is quite poor and dull, far away from Dario Argento's mastery filmmaking. Anyone who say that this masterpiece of horror film needs a modern American remake it must be an idiot.All in this film is groundbreaking. Goblin's music is powerfull and far away from what any contemporary horror music film can express back in the day. Eclecticism is what Italian culture is all about, and you probably know and learn since Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns' revolutionary filmmaking result. But you can also find on Italian progresisve rock bands such as PFM, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, Il Balletto di Bronzo, Le Orme and many more fantastic bands from early seventies, so much as in Italian film history, poetry, music and literature.Dario Argento acomplish on this one of the most impressive horror films ever made, full of sumptuos use of color moving through the screen like a living picture, a direct and eclectic use of Kubrick's taste of moving pictures. The special mixture of color and music build up a masterful film that is unsurpassed until this days and proves that horror film can be beautiful and meneangful, beyond blood and surprise.

Goblin is at the top of their game here, producing their most energetic, atmospheric score ever. It fits in perfectly with the film, from the opening theme that will send chills down your spine to the pounding beats that accompany Suzy's discovery of the witch. The music draws you in and completely immerses you in the film. It is a soundtrack you won't soon forget.Argento's trademark use of color is also superb. Everywhere you look, bright reds, greens, yellows, and blues jump out at you, pulling you deeper into the film's surreal atmosphere. You'll be totally engulfed, almost hypnotized, by this bombardment of colors. Argento utilizes the colors to reflect what's happening on screen. If someone is being murdered or evil lurks nearby, everything glows red. If it is dark and silent, blue will permeate through the screen. Yellow will gleam brightly if something of importance is going to happen. Green usually signifies something peaceful or benevolent, which is a welcome break from the horrors witnessed so far.The performances from everyone are top-notch, especially Suzy and Madam Blanc. Jessica Harper nails Suzy dead on, expressing deep concern, intense fear, or amazing resilience. She does a remarkable job crafting her character. Everything that happens to her is entirely believable and we are right there with her through the entire frightening ordeal. Joan Bennett is brilliant as Madam Blanc. She establishes herself as a maternal figure early on, making it very easy to trust her. Throughout the entire movie, her honesty and dependability do not falter, as you continue to trust her completely. All of the supporting actors and actresses do a great job, portraying their characters wonderfully.The gore is cringe-worthy and very convincing, especially the brutal murder that starts of the movie. Argento uses the gore to maximize the effectiveness of a scene. Many of the bizarre and wonderfully original murders are memorable and will become etched in your memory. All of Argento's trademarks are here in full effect as well: Glass shattering symbolizing the shattering of the character's idyllic worlds, the violence toward women, the extreme zooms, and the very wild camera angles and movements. All of these are used very effectively to create an incredibly creepy and dreadful atmosphere.The plot is very coherent, despite what some people say, and flows nicely. The ending is effective and very disturbing. It may not be very scary, but it is creepy and unsettling. I hope to see the third and final entry in The Three Mothers Trilogy.The Bottom Line: An absolutely fantastic horror movie in every respect. One of my top ten movies.",Suspiria
289,selfparody,Colorful nonsense trying to pass itself off as horror,3,7 June 2005,"Boy, what are all these nice reviews about? This is not an effective horror picture. It is a very gimmicky set up: ""moron goes to alien place and weird, semi-violent stuff happens."" That was done to death by the time HORROR HOTEL came out in the sixties. There's a quote from David Cronenberg's VIDEOROME that certainly applies here: a producer for station watches soft-core porn and says ""No, we can't use this: it's too formal. That's bad for sex."" It just doesn't work to spend lots of time showing dark shadows, playing creepy music, and basically shouting at the audience: ""Hey you, this is going to be scar"" The audience just gets bored, and when the scary thing finally happens, usually after a clichéd lull, we feel relieved that we got through that dull as dirt bit. Horror is much more shocking if stuff actually comes from no where, without a bleeding decade of setup (take the scene in THE EXORCIST where the priest just walks in on a desecrated statue, much creepier than the Linda Blair rubbish, or the popping out alien in ALIEN) This movie gets lot of credit for having ""brilliant color use."" Nonsense: it doesn't take ""brilliance"" to put gels on lights for a few scenes, or to place neon all over the place. Any disco or porn shop owner could hire a contractor to do that. On a related note, the sets don't add to the horror at all: they just look expensive and tasteless. BOOGIE NIGHTS was scarier in its color scheme than this.And the murders? You could tell what was going to happen: you knew the main character was going to pull through well enough (so as not to alienate American audiences to this) and you knew the movie wasn't going to spend minutes on a chase with a killer and just let the character go: oh no, you were just shouting ""die already"" like people do at every slasher flick eventually. (You'll even see the death of the Blind man, the most tasteless and grueling of the deaths in the movie, coming.) Music: kind of creepy the first few minutes. But they played it over, and over, and over again: just irritating.",Suspiria
290,angry127,Horror without the Horror,6,7 January 2011,"Looking at the cover of this film I was expecting to see something very sleazy, gory, and scary. This film had none of those three. Instead what I got was a classy kind of horror movie with some very atmospheric shots and amateurish production. I'm sure some people are going to down vote me for that last statement (which I honestly could care less about) but just hear me out. The melodrama in this movie was really something else. The main character would stare at the camera with her buggy eyes for 30 seconds or so for no apparent reason after someone was talking to her. I'm not sure what the point of this was. During one of the chase scenes the suspenseful music stops and the girl trips when stacking suitcases by a window. Neither of these added to the mood, they detracted from it. There is little left to say besides these scenes being amateurish.The atmosphere of the film is very strange. And how the viewer is supposed to interpret it is kind of ambiguous. We are constantly hearing screaming noises and flashing green and red lights throughout the movie. The characters don't seem to notice these things, but they are not the least bit subtle. I didn't really go for this too much. I'm sure people with disagree, but they are probably fans of the director (apparently he has a cult following of sorts) and don't appreciate reason. The film did have some good suspenseful scenes. The way the music builds up and interleaves with the characters' actions in climatic scenes is mostly well done.All in all you should see this if you like ballerina's and maggots.",Suspiria

Hard to fully understand and concentrate when the actors voices don't match with them talking. The use of color in this film is magnificent and first rate. Looking forward to the upcoming remake, but it won't match Argento's classic. Even though the acting isn't that good, it's still great and creepy, especially with the music.",Suspiria

She struggles to discover the truth behind a series of oddities while taking on a slight illness. One of the most confusing films ever made. This picks up a lot of different beginnings that it never finishes. Never explains itself or the direction it's headed in. It merely relies on the irritatingly dark colored lights and heavily shrill squeals of music. The only film in history where the beginning is as puzzling as the ending.,Suspiria
293,Jack Smith - The King Of Horror,A Fairytale Come To Life.,6,16 January 2001,"SUSPIRIA is widely regarded as a masterpiece of the Horror Genre. Many say it is the greatest Italian Horror Movie ever. These people need to lay of the cough syrup, i'm worried about them! SUSPIRIA may be a classic piece of Neo-Gothic Surrealism and the career defining work of the wayward firebrand DARIO ARGENTO, but it is not in my book a classic horror film. SUSPIRIA is one of the most incoherent films I have ever witnessed, at times it is impossible to tell who is being slaughtered and why. The dubbing is awful and the vulgar colour schemes with which ARGENTO is always obsessed get annoying. At it's best SUSPIRIA has the atmosphere of a fairytale come to life and has a wonderfully jolting soundtrack. However it seemed to me that the ""plot"" has been made up or improvised as it goes along. I preferred the semi-follow up INFERNO which is even more vulgar and incoherent! In conclusion SUSPIRIA is in no way a poor film, it is a surrealist masterpiece worthy of praise, it just didn't really do anything for me. My rating - 6 out of 10.",Suspiria
294,dan_pap,impressive but disappointing,7,13 June 2019,"""Bad luck isn't brought by broken mirrors, but by broken minds.""I have mixed feelings on Suspiria. First off, let me just say that I understand why this film is a classic and why it's largely considered to be one of the greatest horror films of all time. It's unbelievable to watch; the colors are absolutely beautiful and the camera movement is great. I really like the music too, despite the fact that it's repetitive. The dreamlike atmosphere is my favorite part, and it's probably the best way to tell the story.There are a few things that I really don't like about Suspiria too. There's obviously the bad dubbing, but that doesn't really bother me as much. For me, the movie takes too long to really get going. I struggled to find its core purpose until over halfway through. I also feel it's anticlimactic. I think the horror elements in Suspiria are remarkable, but they're short-lived. If this was an American-made horror movie, I feel like any bit of horror would have been milked out to its fullest potential. I'm disappointed that Suspiria doesn't take advantage of the atmosphere it creates.This is a great movie that I really need to watch again. I don't expect the remake to be as good, but I'll give it a go one of these days. The artistry in this movie makes it a must-watch, and though it's not flawless, there's a lot to be admired.",Suspiria
295,trvolk,Skip the hour in the middle,5,16 May 2009,"Suspiria has a great beginning and a truly effective ending, but the middle hour is a craptastic mess of bad writing, bad acting and particularly bad editing. The music by The Goblins is truly haunting but the repeated use of the main theme, over and over and over, and over again, dilutes its impact when once again it loops over the final fifteen minutes. The same applies to the cinematography and its multiple cycles of reds and blues to create atmosphere.The plot was nothing new even in 1977, basically Rosemary's Baby set in a girls' school only without the baby nor even a motive. Hammer Films themselves had already beat this dead horse to a pulp years before.Go ahead and rent though if you are a die-hard horror fan or a film student as the film does have bits of creative genius, however the sum adds up to much less than the whole. Then after viewing it, compare it to Polanski's Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby.",Suspiria

297,Darren-12,Dog's Breakfast,5,1 July 2003,"Warning! Spoilers contained in this review...!This film is a prime example of how important the PLOT is. Argento apparently gets his ideas from writing down his own nightmares, but he could have gone to the trouble of ADAPTING this particular nightmare. To be fair, the ending is tied up as far as the usual ""baddies identified & killed (& building destroyed for good measure)"" type of ending, but it was never made apparent exactly WHAT the coven of witches had been doing. The only ""bad"" acts committed were the murders of people who ""knew too much"", but it was never explained whether all they knew about was the EXISTENCE of the coven, or WHAT IT WAS THEY WERE ACTUALLY DOING. The only clue we are given is when the paranormal ""expert"" professor says that the aim of witches is to accumulate wealth (which not only is news to me, but never figured in the movie). He also said that a coven had a ""head-witch"" and was helpless once the leader was killed (this also is news to me). Why is there a need to invent conventions about witches, when there is plenty of perfectly cinematic and plotworthy mythology in existence. There is a suggestion that the hearts were removed from the bodies of two of the murder victims, but, again, this was never made clear or followed up on.There were so many other things wrong that I can hardly be bothered to list them all but... What was done to the blind pianist's guide-dog when it was first approached (never explained)? The murder of the pianist was actually quite well done, but WHY did they murder him? They accused his dog of having bitten the boy (never clear whether this was true) and sacked him, then he muttered about having ""heard things"" (WHAT things? WHEN WAS THIS?). Having proved that the coven could kill from afar by hidden means (the pianist), how come the first murder of the runaway girl was so messy and dramatic? Multiple stabbing seemed unnecessary, plus the subsequent dropping of the corpse from a great height with a rope tied around the neck was surely likely to draw the attention of the police. Oh, and her head would have come off if dropped from that height. The third death was a bit odd as well: was that barbed wire or razor wire that she fell into? Is just looked like plain wire to me, and she didn't seem to get any extra cuts or scratches from it, and even if she did, can you die from that? Oh, and what was all that with the maggots falling from the ceiling and all the girls then having to sleep together in the main hall? WHAT WAS THE POINT? Just so that the girls could hear the head-witch's wheezy breathing? Or so that the witches could be close to the girls for some reason? Nothing explained, again. Oh, and why did they keep drugging the main girl every night? Why just her? Did they have a special plan for her? If so, WHAT? Oh, and what was that bat in aid of? Was it just a coincidental real bat? Or was it a supernatural bat (sent to do WHAT EXACTLY?).The only definitely supernatural things that happened were: 1) The head-witch's longevity (woop-de-doo!). 2) The head-witch's appearance at the window of the first victim (teleportation? broomstick? changed into a bat? leg-up?). 3) The mind-control over the dog (nice surprise, but how was this achieved? Maybe a mysterious shot suggesting the coven ""in session"" would have been nice here? Or at any other point in the film?). 4) The head-witch's invisibility (again, woop-de-doo! and why did she just carry on sitting in the same place she had last been seen? DUH!). 5) The ""spell"" cast on Susie via the ""flashing blade"" in the hallway (which just made her have a bit of a funny turn). Oh yes, ""a masterpiece of the supernatural"" this.I thought this was going to be one of those films where everything seemed very confusing, but you carry on watching it anyway (even though the acting is pretty poor) because it looks/sounds good, and because you assume everything (or at least SOME THINGS) will be explained at the end, but, be warned, IT ISN'T!On the plus side, Argento's shot-composition, lighting and use of colour are rather splendid, but that's really not enough to make up for the above shortcomings. Er... oh, and the soundtrack is excellent (no really!). 5/10.",Suspiria

She chose the celebrated academy of Freeborge. One day, at nine in the morning, she left Kennedy airport, New York, and arrived in Germany at 10:40 p.m. local time."" Those are the opening lines of Suspiria, as spoken by the narrator. Those lines are the beginning of a must see experience for all horror fans... period.Dario Argento has to be one of the most talented directors in Italian film history. He was influenced by some of the greatest directors in cinema including Alfred Hitchcock. Dario Argento did it all with Suspria. Suspria breaks all the barriers. Not only is it completely nightmarish and bazaar, but it uses different colors of light in a brilliant, chilling way. Suspiria has some of the most memorable scenes in history, whether it be the first shocking murder, the dog biting the man's neck, or the very good ending which will have your eyes glued to the screen. One of the most nightmarish aspects of Suspiria is the over-the-top creepy music that it offers. When ""Goblin"" performs music for a movie, that should be instant indication that the movie will be very tense experience. The tension and suspense in Suspiria is built up by the music.Gore hounds will not be disappointed by Suspiria. Keep in mind, I said ""won't be disappointed"" not ""be impressed"". Suspiria has enough gore to be realalistic, but not enough to impress. However, people who watch Suspiria shouldn't watch it for the gore, they should watch it for the haunting atmosphere and tension.Suspiria was shot in Italy, therefore, if you are watching the movie in an English language you will find that it is dubbed. This may very well be the only reason I found the dialoge in Suspiria to be fairly average. The dubbed audio didn't fit very well, but it isn't beyond terrible.The only con of Suspiria is the fact that it seems to be dragged out. However, this hardly hurts the film in anyway, and is almost unnoticeable to first time viewers. The first time I viewed Suspiria will be a experience I will not forget.I highly recommend Suspiria to every euro-horror fan out there. It is very nightmarish, creepy, suspenseful, nightmarish, terrifying... Did I mention nightmarish?For weekly reviews of horror movies, check out my youtube channel: horrorreviews123",Suspiria
299,Schwenkstar,Argento's masterpiece! A surreal fairy tale that reflects upon femininity and the transference to womanhood.,9,20 November 2007,"Director Dario Argento designed the film not as a categorical horror film, but rather as a surreal fairy tale. Its construction is purposefully unreal and fabricated in order to create a dreamlike, fabled storybook semblance that manifests the perspective of the Suzy, a young girl leaving the security of domesticity for the first time in life. Her child-like innocence becomes juxtaposed with the harshness of reality that she has never encountered before, and as fairy tales did for children, she tries to interpret the unfeeling world while trying to maintain a sense of that said colorful innocence. Indeed, within the film characters are child-like and naive with their world is awash in iridescent luminosity that seems wholly fabricated. The dialogue is simplistic (as if a child was speaking) and the narrative is both uncomplicated and elementary with lapses in logic (as fairy tales often contain). The mystery, however, is potent as if reflects the mystery of a new life that Suzy is encountering. The music is ominous and foreboding, with a palpable dread that mirrors her apprehension in this transitional period within her life. These motifs lie buried just underneath the surface of what falsely appears to be a facile tale of horror. Indeed, it is the presentation of the film itself that is the main focus of the filmmakers as it creates a rich critique of femininity and the transference to womanhood. This is truly one of the most artful horror films ever to be produced.",Suspiria
300,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of Suspiria,10,21 February 2013,"Suspiria is the 1977 giallo classic directed by Dario Argento. So for those of you who don't know giallo is a style of film making that takes pride in bright colors,inventive shots,and blood,lots and lots of bright red blood. So Suspiria is about a girl who travels to a very famous ballet school.On the night of her arrival we are treated to a very tense and scary kill sequence.Things go from bad to worse as she slowly finds out that an evil coven of witches is using the school as a cover and their base of operations. Suspiria is a wonderful film that is both truly scary and chock full of gore.Suspiria also has a haunting soundtrack courtesy of the Italian progressive rock band,Goblin. See Suspiria if you love horror films and realize that horror film can excel to a true form of art and fine art at that.Skip this if you don't love horror films,this is an absolute must for any horror film fan. 10/10",Suspiria
301,liveaholic,Style over substance indeed,5,7 October 2021,"To the film's credit, the cinematography is quite captivating, and the music is iconic. That being said, the writing is simply not good and the acting is, frankly, dreadful. Scenes often seem to abruptly end for no discernable reason.. in fact, I found myself playing back a few scenes just to see if I somehow missed something....nope, just very odd editing decisions.While there are a few somewhat gory or unsettling moments, a large portion of the movie is spent watching either emotionless lines being delivered, or straight-up unrealistic dialogue that you'd think was written by a 7-year old. Most of the time, you can clearly tell the actors are just waiting for the other person to finish their line, so they can immediately say their own. Comes across very unnatural and really prevents you from making any connection to any of the characters.This may have some legitimate reasons for becoming a cult classic, but at the end of the day, it's a pretty mediocre film.",Suspiria

Now, the movie has grown on me a bit and I appreciate it more but it's not everything it's cracked up to be. Yes, the film is nice to look at and contains a spooky moment or two and some excellent music but overall, it's pretty much just eye and ear candy and not much more. The problem with the film is that the majority of it simply cannot live up to the frantic, chilling opening 17 minutes or so. Dario went all out with the opening but the rest of the film suffers because it's a letdown after that. Anyway, might make for a cool bit of late night viewing so judge for yourself, it's the best way to decide.",Suspiria

For once there aren't zombies involved, or the good guy turns out to be the bad guy clichés. The colors he uses are truly unique! I actually think Frank Miller is secretly a fan because of the use of red in argentos movies. The bad things about this movie was that it realistically could have been condensed into 20-30 minutes. As you can imagine the middle was drawn out, and almost boring. There wasn't as much blood as I expected from Argento (blood doesn't make a good movie in my opinion either, but from Argento its what I expect to see). This is another movie I would suggest seeing if its at the local store, if you don't see it and you want an Italian gem, rent ""City of the Living Dead"" (and I know many argenta fans will be mad at me for saying that, but its just my opinion). 1 last comment is that this film feels pretty dated, its weird seeing velved walls...",Suspiria

She sees someone running in the woods at night, sounds like horror materials there. Hears girl telling her not to come in. What the f### is going on right now?

I present to you, a horror film that had visuals and music like no other horror film could ever do or even think that they could do. ""Suspiria"", a horror film that is not psychologically scary, or not on that level that gore makes you scared, but actually the colors and haunting chants of the music that plays with your emotions constantly. The main characters in the movie is being threatened that they will be killed. Nobody realizes it, but only the audience itself. To only watch dark magic pop out in front of their eyes without anybody else knowing it. A scary secret that Dario Argento shares with us.Even if the film doesn't feel real with it's crazy and surreal use of colors, it still feels realistic because in fact, it looks more of a nightmare that we would have and not something real. A nightmare you thought was real.""Suspiria"" offers blasting visuals that give it a nightmare presence and chanting ritual style music filled with drum beats that echoes into our hearts and the same music cue can tell us that there's going to be a death that one cannot avoid when they hear this music.",Suspiria

309,theeintolerablekidd,Over-rated nonsense,4,7 May 2009,"I was highly recommended this film after two good friends both independently raved to me about it. Two friends separately telling me this is a masterpiece? Wow it must be good! But oh my God was I unimpressed. I even found it difficult to sit through, having to watch it in two parts. Not because it was scary, but because it was so boring I couldn't stand it. I told one of my friends and he said 'stick with it, the ending is amazing'. The ending was not amazing, the ending was pathetic and even worse than the beginning. The last time this happened was with Rosemary's Baby, and what a piece of rubbish that was. This film in the same category.It has a bad script, is ill thought out, has boring subject matters (ballet and witchcraft, nice), then throws in some cod psychology and has some of the lamest scenes I've ever seen. Like when the girl is in the attic and the guy chasing her is taking forever to unhinge a simple latch. Then when she escapes thru a window she falls into a room full of barbed wire. Why on Earth is there a room full of barbed wire? (My friend tells me it's a trap, yeah OK...) And then instead of getting up she writhes around pathetically in it... And the ending, oh God, it was awful.But, I give this film a four because it has decent music (not amazing like I was told, but good original music by the Goblins) and some beautiful cinematography and excellent use of colours. It is worth watching for that alone, but, as another reviewer rightly said, in places some of that beauty is taken over by seediness and it has the feeling of a 70s porn film... but with no nudity. If you want to be scared or horrified don't watch this. This film is not scary, even for one second. This film is not the ""masterpiece"" I was told it was, how anyone could call it that is beyond me, and definitely falls short of being a work of ""art"". I came away from this film feeling immediately disappointed and after a week of pondering it I now feel that it was pretentious art school rubbish. Thanks.",Suspiria
310,Potty-Man,One of the best unintentional comedies ever!,4,8 August 2005,"I just finished watching Suspiria. Oh, my, what a mess. Some parts were SO BAD. The cinematography/lighting and the score were great, but other that that... I found some scenes to be worthy of the Mystery Science Theater treatment. The plot made little to no sense, and the main plot device that leads to the resolution lacks all credibility. While some of the effects and make-up were neat, most of them were extremely cheesy. The acting is really bad, the dialogue scenes are poorly handled and horribly written. Most of the time the actors sound like they're reading out of cue cards or advertising a product on the Home Shopping Network. Plus, the dubbing is really obvious throughout the film. The movie started off really well, I thought I was going to enjoy it, but it became unbearably ridiculous. On second thought, at least I can say this one thing in favor of the movie: even if it's trash, at least it's unique, uncompromising trash. Argento must have been pretty gutsy to submit such a movie (especially at the time). I'm curious to see more of his work, especially recent films, to see how his technique changed over the years.",Suspiria
311,Sewaat,Horror has never been this Colourful,7,29 June 2017,"Suspiria was directed by Italian film maker Dario Argento and was released in 1977. It is often overshadowed by more popular horror titles of the 1970's, particularly John Carpenter's Halloween which came out the following year. However, as an avid horror fan I find immense enjoyment in Suspiria. It is certainly underrated and unfairly overlooked.Suspiria makes up for what it lacks in story-telling by presenting us with beautiful, vibrant and striking images. Set designs and lighting which conjure strong emotions of dread and tension. The colour palette was beautifully designed so to evoke both fear and wonder in it's viewers. This is certainly the film's biggest strength. The cinematography is nearly perfect and completely embodies the mood and tones of this morbid, bright thriller.Another great strength to this film is it's soundtrack. While repetitive at times, it still lends an amazing depth to the film and I cannot imagine watching it without the score.Of course this film does have a couple of weaknesses. Suspiria was an international production, involving various actors from different regions to collaborate with one another. While some characters look and sound perfectly acceptable, the poor dubbing for some of the non-English speaking cast members is often distracting and takes the viewer out of the experience.While some of the performances themselves leave something to be desired, Jessica Harper is vulnerable yet compelling as the film's protagonist. And while her character is not necessarily complex, hers is not required to be. Suzy Bannon is the every girl. The ordinary citizen who finds herself trapped in extraordinary circumstances and thus, must try to escape from them. There is something noble to found in a female character who does not depend on other people too much for support and is able to escape from danger entirely on her own. Especially in a film such as this.Suspiria is a visual masterpiece of Horror. It is tense, atmospheric and full of striking colours and lighting. The story and performances are lacking, but overall it is a entertaining yet very sophisticated slasher film. It's visuals convey more than what mere words can describe. And for that, it should not be overlooked or disregarded.",Suspiria
312,EYEboy,Chills aplenty!,9,2 December 1998,"Just to dispense with one aside -- if you liked the soundtrack to this, it's available on CD, and worth getting. I actually find listening to the music from SUSPIRIA as frightening as the movie itself. Now, for the film... Agree with the Argento purists, it's got its flaws (not the least of which is the total absence of logic), but if you put that aside, you'll find this one hell of a ride. Agree also that it should be seen uncut and widescreen, preferably on a very big screen. I saw this at the theater back in '77, and was blown away; it's not the same on the box, but then, what is? One of my favorite horror movies, SUSPIRIA isn't consistently terrific, but oh, the highs it hits... Still, I think Argento's giallos (especially PROFONDO ROSSO) are superior.",Suspiria
313,oscarhopkins,The Art of Carnage,7,20 November 2005,"Hitchcockian suspense, brilliant colors, and a killer ending. This one's got it all, folks.This is a truly great film. I understand some blockhead is remaking it, which is about as foolish as the chowerhead who re-filmed Psycho block for block and added an...unfortunate scene.There will never be another Suspiria. Never. The colors, texture and nuances are artistic.Artistic. Does anyone see what an achievement this is? It's a slasher film, and it's actually beautiful. I mean, it is gorgeous. Terrifying and breathtaking at the same time. A utter orgasm of movie magic from an era when artistic vision outweighed the dollar.This remake, whatever its aim, will flounder and die. Suspiria, the ONLY legitimate Suspiria, will never be forgotten. Directors have no common sense these days, and have no hope of making a film with the depth and precision of Suspiria.What else shall I say? Shall I describe for you any of the suspenseful unfolding? No, only a monster would deprive an audience of these choice morsels. Should I warn the uninspired among you to avoid this film, since you appreciate nothing unless buildings explode and bimbos in leather shoot automatic rifles? Well, I just did.This film is grotesquely perfect.",Suspiria
314,twltzone,Nice visuals and disturbing sound effects.,8,21 October 1999,"This movie was very unique. I really liked the cinematography in this film; there is a lot of symbolism going on there. ""Suspiria"" is visually aesthetic and the sound effects were disturbing to say the least. Although sometimes, they tended to ""over-use"" the sound effects a bit, I still liked this film a lot.Very unique atmosphere, like no other horror movie I've ever seen. Weird characters and setting. I was VERY VERY surprised that this movie was made in 1977!! Was there ever a remake of this film? Usually movies made in the 70's have this really dated psychedelic soundtrack but ""Suspiria"" doesn't (""Phantasm"" comes to mind, but I still love it).  The Suspiria soundtrack has really stood the test of time.  There's not a whole lot going on in the plot, but the films visuals should keep most horror fans entertained. I wasn't really ever scared watching it but I loved the visuals. Nice Film!!Bravo!!! Dario Argento!!!",Suspiria
315,Billy Edwards,As good as it gets.,10,25 July 2001,"Holding out to see the top of Italian horror?  Here it is.  See why Dario Argento is considered a modern horror master.   From beginning to end, he creates a disturbing mood, which will last long after the final frame.  The story has since been ripped off countless times, but never pulled off quite so well.  Yes, bad dubbing can be a distraction, but stick with it.  Stick with uncut versions, as the edited versions tend to be choppy.   And as a warning, Italian horror is for those with strong stomachs only.",Suspiria
316,slmstanley,Cut to ribbons,6,19 September 2000,"Like all of Argento's work, Suspiria is a stylish, atmospheric thriller. Sadly, most prints I have viewed seem to have been edited into an incoherent mess, and the soundtrack is thick and somewhat scratchy, making the dialogue difficult to follow.(MILD SPOILER AHEAD)Nevertheless, this is well worth seeing, even with the sound and editing problems. Argento's trademark shocks - such as a leap into a room filled with barbed wire - leave an impression on the viewer. The relentless musical score adds to the claustrophobic feel of the film, and the shadowy cinematography enhances the feeling of immediate danger.
All in all, a nice rental for a stormy afternoon.",Suspiria
317,john_murdoch2002,A definitive top five horror film,10,26 September 2002,"When I sat down to compose my top five list of greatest horrormovies (a feat inspired by High Fidelity), I took into account thecraftsmanship of the filmmaking, the creativity it took, how well thefilmmakers worked with what they had and how quickly it took meto recover from the film. The list ended up looking like this:1. The Exorcist 2. The Silence of the Lambs 3. Suspiria 4. Halloween 5. Night of the Living DeadNow, why would Suspiria rank so highly on my list? The mainreason was that director Dario Argento's style and visual senseset him in a class that was far beyond any other horror director Ihave ever seen (I categorize Hitchcock in the suspense category).If you watch his set up and choreography of each shot in Suspiria,one can only imagine the time and effort that he took into makingthe shot. The amount of time it took to adjust the lighting just right,to get the actors to move in a certain way in their positions, theplacement of the set designs, the use of the simple, yet effectivemusic, all are executed in this film with such precision andcreativity.If you watch the choreography of the first murder scene, you'llnotice how everything is set up just perfectly within the first minute,using the next to build a sense of dread, the next to clench theaudience in a sense of fear, and that final minute to take thatsense a bit further and show the full brutality of a murder. That'sone thing Argento does well, deglamourizing murder. If you were towatch of the murder scenes in Suspiria, you'll notice howdisturbing they are to watch, but at the same time, how they lookjust fake enough to distance the audience from reality. By doingthis, Argento is able to both repel, but keep us grounded in the factthat the violence in this film is fictional and should not beglamorized.Granted, the characters are never as clearly defined as, say, JodieFoster's in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" or Ellen Burstyn in ""TheExorcist,"" and there is a good reason for that. By doing this,Argento still maintains that safe distance from the audience, sothe murders seem less glamorous. Also, this allows Argento theability to enter a more surreal universe and create an almoststorybook like surrounding.Overall, the effect of this film is one of complete dread, wheresuspense lurks around every corner of the gothic dance academyand the audience is never quite sure where the attack is going tocome from. This alone should be grounds to make if an aboveaverage horror film. But Argento's style takes it a step further tobecome an icon in the horror film genre.",Suspiria
318,hodo68,"Wooden acting, weak plot = masterpiece?",3,31 December 2007,"I searched out this movie after seeing it included several ""best of"" lists on the internet. Maybe it was my high expectations but I found myself disappointed with this film. While there are several genuine eerie scenes, the whole film as a whole didn't work for me. It concerns a young American ballet student, who enrols in an exclusive ballet school, only to discover sinister goings on involving witchcraft. There's not a whole lot to the story beyond this. I didn't find myself gripped to know what was happening next as the film rattled along its wooden acting tracks. The acting for me was the biggest drawback. The delivery tends to be dull, even from the American actors. There is some interesting use of colour, but for this viewer I can only express disappointment on this movie. At around 80 minutes it is mercifully short so it may be worth seeking out if only to see what all the carry on is about.",Suspiria
319,ShaShank_MovieFreak,A Horror Masterpiece.,8,26 January 2012,"Dario Argento, the master of Giallo gives us one of the most beautiful and intense horror movies in the history of film-making. Suspiria is easily his best Giallo yet.I have nearly seen every Giallo of Dario Argento. So, to scare me, the movies really need to be very frightening. I have seen Suspiria very recently. The movie kept me at the edge of my seat and biting my nails. The horror element was very successfully executed in this film. With classy and gory haunting murders, good-enough cast, wonderful artwork and one of the creepiest soundtracks in the movies ever, Suspiria is a ride you will never forget once taken. I just don't know why the Art direction wasn't at least nominated for an Oscar.The pace of the story, the gore, the story itself(not a complicated one, but still..) and the art, all together create a very effective and eerie atmosphere which definitely gives chills.So, give this movie a serious shot. Simply, a horror masterpiece.",Suspiria

321,Dr_Drew_Says,Dr. Drew says... 6 out of 10,6,26 September 2013,"Suspiria (1977): The Good, the Bad and the ColorfulSynopsis: Dario Argento's giallo of a young American who goes to Europe to attend a ballet boarding school. Little does she know the school has a dark secret. As events unfold, young Susan starts to realize and uncover the truth behind those in charge.The Good: Argento, among a few others like Bava and Fulchi, are the ""masters"" of giallo and if you know what that is, your viewing pleasure will be enhanced. This isn't straight up horror, it's a murder-mystery-thriller with a penchant for some excessive blood and shock. For what it is, Argento does it well. The collaborative efforts from screen to sound are a work of art. The soundtrack, performed by the band Goblin, in essence, make the film, because it's really not scary at all. Those who coin phrases like, ""the scariest film I've ever seen"" are just silly. It's not scary. It's atmospheric. The widely applauded use of angles and color are as good as advertised. It's a very nice looking film. Moods are well-captured and yes, it is quite ""arthouse"" in form and thus, loved by film snobs worldwide. Am I a snob? No, but I do well to appreciate something new and different and well-captured and this is a film worth seeing for that alone. The Bad: All that good stuff about cinematography and atmosphere aside, the script of this movie is a mess in places and incoherent in others. No one that is not taking a ""snobbish"" approach to this film can deny that there are just some flat out bad scenes in this movie. Stilted acting, wooden dialogue... it's all there. This is one of those movies that has received acclaim and now, it seems no one wants to backtrack and call it what it really is... a decent giallo that is far from a ""work of art"". Strictly speaking, the story just isn't a great one... not great enough to stand the test of time. Nor is it told in any way that is unique. The only unique and interesting quality is the way the movie is filmed. That sets it apart and makes it an Argento film. That is great and all, but it doesn't make it a cinematic classic in these eyes. The story is what is missing here. It's just very dull and slow-moving, but done in a nice-looking way. It's a sawdust cake that is beautifully frosted, but has nothing tasty at it's core.The Colorful: As stated before, Argento's use of color in the film is truly brilliant. It creates mesmerizing atmosphere and it is unforgettable and makes the film unique and worth watching. The use of bright red blood is one of style and some reviews seem to not acknowledge that (i.e. ""...and the blood was just so fake!""). Yeah... it's supposed to look that way. Coupled with a musical score that brought out the vibrant reds and greens, the look and feel are as good as any movie out there, horror or not. Too bad the content doesn't match.",Suspiria

Without a doubt this is Argento' s finest, even better than PROFONDO ROSSO. Everything here in the film, from the actors to the direction, the colours, the music, everything has only one task: Scare you to death. And this is accomplished quite easily! SUSPIRIA contains some of the most frightening  and violent death scenes ever. I remember watching the movie for the first time in the '80s when I was a wee lad thinking THEY CAN'T DO THAT while, actually,well,they just did.. Quite a few sleepless nights over this. In short, if you're a horror movie buff, you have to watch this movie. Then you'll be hooked forever.. Truly, really, they don't make'em like this anymore. Rating:8",Suspiria
324,movieman430,Artsy? Maybe. Good? Anything but.,9,18 December 2007,"Okay. I sat down to watch this movie with a couple of my friends. I had heard it was interesting and was Dario Argento's ""masterpiece"". I was not familiar with the director and while I'm not a huge fan of 1970s cult horror, against my better judgment I threw it into the DVD player. And then watched it. From beginning to end. Yeah. Okay. Now, first, before I go on a tirade about why and just how hard this film sucked, let me tell something to all your cult horror fans who love this movie. I understood it, it's not existential and complex, it just sucks. Just because something is bizarre, doesn't make it cool. All you artsy douche bags think that because it was rejected by mainstream media as trash, it must have some underlying genius. Somethings are just trash. And if you think I'm too Hollywood or mainstream, I like indies probably more than the next guy, but things become mainstream because they work well and i don't know... aren't giant piles of crap. Now, the plot of this film could be written out on the backside of a fortune cookie so I'll summarize it real quick. A young dancer Suzy (Jessica Harper) goes to a European dance school just as a a girl dies a gristly death and after a while realizes that the school is run by a cult of witches and the head witch is this invisible woman from the 1800s, but she's still alive (this is the kind of logic we're dealing with). Okay, did that blow your mind? It blew mine. The film grabs you with a totally bizarre and graphic opening death sequence, stabbed, hung and all kinds of crazy glass wounds. It's all down hill after that. I'll admit Suspiria has one thing going for it, Goblin offers a great soundtrack to the film, very chilling. Okay, back to why this film sucks ass. Most of the people who regard this film as a cult masterpiece because of the atmosphere it creates. Okay, the set design is creative, is it good? Hell no. Just because something looks crazy doesn't make it the best thing since sliced bread. And by the way, basking everything in technicolor lights isn't creative, it's annoying as hell. The film is visually interesting, but with the lack of plot and anticlimactic ending, it sucks on way to many counts to call this movie anything but bad. Are the deaths gory, yes but there are four of them and none are adequately explained. The villains motives are skipped over and the film just ends. I'm going to ruin it for everyone. Suzy stabs an invisible witch then the building begins to shake and bursts into flames just as she runs out the door. What about the children? Oh right, they were conveniently out at the opera or somewhere. In the end, this movie sucks. I can almost see the argument for why it's great, but I don't buy it one bit. This film is not scary unless you're on acid and atmosphere alone does not make a film. A great example of why when people think of film, they think of Hollywood, not crazy Italian drug addicts. Terrible on nearly every account.",Suspiria

One of the greatest horror movies ever, so influential that many try (more or less successfully) to achieve this cinematographic greatness.Plot is simple, yet effective. As a horror film, it creates the unease, tension and spooky atmosphere in colorful 1970s style. So when I think of this movie, the first thing that comes to my mind are the lights and saturated colors. Perfect for a rainy October night!Along with great photography, many memorable scenes wouldn't be complete without the perfect soundtrack (""Suspiria, ""Witch""...). Possibly the best music for a horror movie ever, the original theme is a horror movie's heaven... or hell.",Suspiria

The story and premise are great and keep you hooked until the end. However there are a few laughs along the way due to the acting and script which haven't aged well. Characters doing stupid things and exposition galore. The film has been spoofed a lot since, so I don't think that helps.Its clear to see though the influence that the films has had on horrors since and it must be applauded for that, despite it being a bit rough around the edges and let's be honest it doesn't really have any underlying theme apart from some mention of mental health and the line ""a broken mirror is not what's broken, it is the mind.""

327,Cinemafou,Mixed reaction,5,25 January 2013,"I was impressed with the relative originality of the first part of the film. Relative in that it is stylistically way over the top. It is pretty outrageous in a way I had not seen before. However, the plot quickly bifurcated. Maybe I missed something, but I could not relate those first scenes with what followed. And what followed just seemed to roll inexorably downhill as the film went on. It does seem to maintain a dark and blood soaked atmosphere throughout, but at times it drags and toward the end it started to get a little silly. So I give it a 5, points added for stylistic excess and points subtracted for being dramatically insipid.",Suspiria

Taus-Melek and Melek-Tawus, Peacock Angel - a Yezidic angel whose name is another word for the devil of Buddhism. When invoked during conjuring rituals he manifests as a peacock. He is also said to be ""an angel or demiurge who created Eve from the body of Adam"" in Forlong's Encyclopedia of Religions. According to the Kurdish Moslem sect of Yezidics in the Upper Mesopotamia (Iraq), Taus-Melek ""is a fallen archangel, now pardoned, to whom God has committed the government of the world and the management of the transmigration of souls."" Melek Tawus is an angel who has fallen from God's grace, and for his repentance, is restored to God's favor. While in hell, Melek Tawus, in seven thousand years filled seven jars with his tears of repentance which extinguished the fires of hell, or at the last judgment will be used to do so. Melek Tawus was banished from the sight of God because he refused to bow down, as asked, before God's creation, Adam. But Yezidis do not identify the fallen angel with a spirit of ""evil."" The act of disobedience has been forgiven by god as a father forgives a wayward son. During the climax of Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" Suzy Banyon (Jessica Harper) is waiting for the awakening of Mater Suspiriorum (The Mother of Sights) from her ghastly slumber. She is standing near the figure of Melek Tawus, black Peacock Angel, Satan himself. ""Suspiria"" is so masterful in its submission of colors and so full of symbolism that its praising is a blasphemy.

This film is more about an assault of the subconscious by methods impressionism. I do not agree that this is a gorey film or that it is very bloody, because it isn't.

The movie has obviously aged technically, the plot is quite linear, the script is simple and the characters are rather flat. My biggest issue was the often poor audio quality which made it hard to understand the dialogue while it was being overpowered by the background sound. Despite all that, Suspiria isn't the movie that is going to be praised for it's gore but rather for its build-up and visual appeal. The vibrant color scheme creates a unique and surreal atmosphere. The stylish mood is only enhanced by an impressive score composed by the progressive rock band Goblin. Overall, Suspiria is more than just eye candy and I'm pretty sure that it would've been one of my favourite movies ever when it came out.",Suspiria
332,forecastfortoday,Deserves to be considered a classic,10,27 February 2010,"Dario Argento is an absolute genius. He makes wonderful horror and mystery movies. Such movies as The Bird with Crystal Plumage, Four Flies on Grey Velvet, and Deep Red are simply art on film. This film is certainly no exception, this time it strays from a giallo and steps towards a more surreal, supernatural feel.The movie is about a pretty young woman named Suzy Banion (played wonderfully by Jessica Harper) who is going from New York to a luxury dance academy in Germany. Upon arriving at the academy, she sees a woman named Pat Hingle (Eva Axén) escaping from the academy in a panic. That night, Pat is brutally dispatched upon arriving at her apartment building. The next day, Suzy meets the directors of the academy, Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) along with a beautiful yet jumpy young lady named Sara (Stefania Casini). Sara warns Suzy that Pat was one of her friends in the academy and that Pat ran away because she believed the academy was being run by witches, ultimately leading to her death. Sara begins to become more aware of the strange things happening at the school, such as footsteps outside of her room and a strange hoarse yawning that echoes throughout the academy. Sara continues to tell Suzy about the mysteries going on around the academy until she to is murdered. It is then up to Suzy to conquer the evil force that's running the academy before she is the next victim.The surreal and sometimes day-dreamy quality of the film seems like you are watching someone's nightmare on your television. Scenes like a conversation between Sara and Suzy in a mosaic pool and Pat's twisted death scene gives the feeling of something that an artist would paint while hallucinating from a drug. The red and blue colored filters that show up during shadowy and dark scenes make the film feel like it's being watched through the eyes of the monster tormenting our heroine. Some standout scenes would be not only Pat's scene, but also a scene in which Sara is chased into a room full of razor wire and then killed with a gleaming straight razor, along with the twisted climax in which Suzy comes face-to-face with a clear view of the terror that haunts the academy. Once the movie is at it's end you feel like you have witnessed the same terror that Suzy has seen, along with the feeling of relief that comes from Suzy escaping the academy during a rain storm. This movie is one of the only movies that I will ever truly need to see on Blu-Ray or HD because the surreal and colorful movie must be seen in all possible beauty and crisp view possible. It deserves to have a place on the Top 250 (Not unlike Halloween, Silent Night Bloody Night or Black Christmas) and it deserves to be recognized as a classic.",Suspiria
333,gordonm88,Moody masterpiece,9,22 December 2002,"Suspiria has garnered a set of mixed reviews on IMDB, but the film worked for me. Argento's use of color, musical score, lighting and camera movement combine to create a moody masterpiece.  The four or five scenes of violence each deliver something unusual and memorable.  Jessica Harper is hauntingly beautiful as the American student in unfamiliar surroundings.   There were several moments that will stay with me - the opening murders, the blind pianist's death, even a simple scene like Jessica Harper standing in a downpour and asking the taxi driver for help with her bags - and not receiving any response or help at all, thus creating a sense of detachment.Yes, there are indeed some unexplained aspects of the storyline, say, instances where the motivation of the coven is unclear. But why insist that everything be clear? We're dealing with the supernatural not with an Agatha Christie murder mystery.Suspiria does some things extremely well and delivers a cinematic experience that is top rank.

I would say that i found it better than deep red which I own as well. The problem I had with this movie is I loved the beginning of this movie it truly is one of the best openings in a horror movie but after the double murder scene the movie goes cold. It's like it turned into a drama, it truly would have been better if there was a lot more scenes like the opening scene. I have only scene this and deep red from argento, I know there is a lot of fans of his work and i must not be one. I would say not to let my opinion stop you from watching it though because there are a ton of people who love it and you might too, but as for me I would just as soon watch a good fulci flick if I'm in the mood for Italian, I will say the colors of this film really are like nothing else I had seen before.",Suspiria

336,bdeyes81,The Most Beautiful Horror Film Ever Made,10,2 November 2001,"As has already been mentioned by a fellow fan on this list, I didn't see any reason that I should offer my perspective on Suspiria. However, considering the shockingly negative comments that have been dominating this discussion as of late, I felt it was my duty as a devoted Argentophile to defend and further acclaim this masterful film.Suspiria is the story of Suzy Banyon (cult superstar Jessica Harper, of Phantom of the Paradise and Stardust Memories fame), a young American woman who enrolls in the Tanzakedemie dance school in Germany...only to learn that this celebrated establishment is a beautiful front for a coven of evil witches.Yes, that's basically the plot...but Suspiria is not about plot...it's about experience. This is not an American horror film, and should not be judged by the same standards used to judge American horror films. As a matter of fact, Suspiria pretty much throws out the rules of cinema in favor of the logic of dreams...to put it bluntly, Suspiria is the definitive cinematic nightmare, a wildly colorful and dizzyingly stylish funhouse of blood and beauty. Take it seriously and you'll laugh. Take it too lightly and you'll be bored. It demands a degree of intelligence and sophistication from the viewer, but this does not mean that it necessarily follows any archetype, and it certainly should not be discredited for its lack of conventional movie wisdom.A lot of Argento's fans and critics alike attack his films for bad acting, but I would have to disagree, particularly in the case of Suspiria. All of the actors in this film are fine actors, and if their performances seem ""dull"" or ""weak"" its because Argento WANTED them to act that way, much the same way David Lynch put to great use ""intentional badness"" in such films as Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, and the current smash Mullholland Drive.  The unusual performances in the film add to the surreal quality, benefitting both A.)the film's dreamy feel and B.)its root in gothic fairy tales.Suspiria is, in my opinion, one of the most truly terrifying films ever made. However, this is MY opinion. I find my nightmares to be far more frightening than any horror movie or ghost story or strange noises in the middle of the night. However, fear is a far more subjective emotion that people give it credit for-witness the unbelievably extreme responses to 1999's The Blair Witch Project-and thus it's not fair to blast Suspiria based on whether or not it frightened you. On a personal note, my all time favorite horror film is Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street...yet it has NEVER scared me. Contrary to what American filmmakers profess, horror films are about much more than simply scaring an audience. Essentially they are just conventional dramas, pushed to the extreme in terms of visceral emotional response and, often times, the explicitness of onscreen content. Such a definition could and should be applied to Suspiria.The most popular theory about Suspiria is one shared by many critics and many fans, and that is that the film is a technical masterpiece...period. This is something with which I partially agree, AND vehemently disagree. First off, Suspiria definitely has an emotional component to it. It's not as present as in other popular horror films of its time-Halloween, The Shining, A Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.-but its there. And while the plot gets criticized, its apparent ""weakness"" is crucial to the effectivness of the film; if the movie made sense, it wouldn't be scary at all! With all that having been said, I must admit that the strongest elements of Suspiria are its technical merits. In all honesty, this film is one of the best movies I have EVER seen in regards to 1.)cinematography, 2.)musical editing, 3.)camera movement, 4.)framing and composition, and 5.)original soundtrack. The film is literally a sensorial assault on the viewer, with bizarre color schemes and an even more bizarre soundtrack being thrust upon the audience throughout every frame. The most minute details are splashed across the screen in Argento's wonderfully fanciful style, and the result is....SUSPIRIA.I realize that I have done little more than defend Suspiria against some of its criticisms, but quite frankly I think the film speaks for itself as a true work of art. Suspiria is the most beautiful horror film ever made, and if you never thought that ""beautiful horror film"" could not be an oxymoron...watch this film immediately. This is truly required viewing for horror film fans, the perfect introduction for cinemaphiles everywhere into the fascinating realm of ""EuroHorror"", and most of all the best possible starting point for anyone interested in the work of Dario Argento, who gets my vote as the finest director working today. The best thing about seeing Suspiria for the first time is that his other, less renowned films are even BETTER...which will be hard to believe by the time you are getting over the experience of this one!I highly recommend that you all purchase Anchor Bay's stunning DVD edition of the film, recently released in a standard edition as well as a three disc special edition. Unfortunately the three disc edition was limited to 100,000 copies, and after less than two months of release is all but impossible to find in stores. If you can get a copy, do so...it contains the excellent documentary ""Suspiria: 25th Anniversary"" and overall gets my vote as the very BEST DVD on the market! However, the standard movie-only edition is extraordinary as well. It boasts a jaw-dropping transfer from the original negative of the uncut Italian version of the film, as well as a bevy of newly mixed DTS and Dolby Digital tracks and a batch of great supplements.Avoid the backlash, watch the film...and prepare to ""never again feel safe in the dark""!My Grade: A+",Suspiria
337,cmoitze,Art on celluloid,9,20 January 2011,"This story concerns a young ballet student, named Suzy Bannion, who has arrived in Freiburg, Germany to study at a prestigious dance academy. Very strange things begin to happen at this school, with students going missing and one staff member mysteriously killed. Who or what is behind these bizarre goings on?Suspiria is a must see for horror aficionados. This movie has atmosphere to burn. Director Dario Argento is exceptional here with his use of colour, especially reds and blues that are at times beautiful and other times disorientating. The music is suitably sinister, with many different compositions, conveying unease and tension. Jessica Harper is great as the anxious Suzy Bannion, portraying the haunted look very well, particularly in her eyes. The acting by all concerned is fairly solid. A special mention must also go to the interior sets. These are magnificent and give the school a real Gothic look.If you are looking for something different, with heaps of atmosphere and imagination, this movie is highly recommended. Definitely not your usual bubblegum mainstream horror movie. Suspiria is also one of those films that can stand up to repeated viewings. A classic, 10 out of 10.",Suspiria
338,beccabentley,Horrendously bad,1,4 October 2015,"Please do not take the positive reviews of this film seriously. Anyone who thinks this film is worth watching is living on a different planet. I love well made horror films and was inspired to watch this by all the gushing reviews. I think I managed to sit through about 20 mins of this mess. The acting was wooden, the plot disjointed and confusing. The jarring soundtrack did not fit with what was happening and just became a ghastly annoyance. I don't understand why everyone goes on about the use of colour..everything just looked garish and completely unrealistic. The whole thing came across as if a child had put it all together. I've watched more believable and more sophisticated hammer house of horror episodes! This film should never be on any top films list. Awful, just awful.",Suspiria
339,MrJoe1987,7+ stars? Really?,2,25 August 2018,"Normally, I don't review anything that I didn't finish watching but, My God, I really couldn't help myself, this time. I only made it through about 2/3, and that was because I turned it off when I was unable to fall asleep through the rest of it. I'll get to why, quickly.Apart from simply not being scary (literally, no emotional response from me), the acting was utterly horrible, and the imagery looked like something out of a lame 90's rave party. The worst thing about it, however, was the ""music."" Holy cow, is it bad. It's to my understanding that there are a circle of admirers that regard this film's score as something avant-garde. That may be so but, unfortunately, I don't live in the land of arts and farts. So, whatever special meaning there is in just MAKING NOISE is completely lost on me. I was able to make it all the way through The Third Man with its insipid, ceaseless zither music, but I couldn't do it with Suspiria. It was boring enough that it was putting me to sleep but, like I said, I had to turn it off because of how obnoxious the ""score"" was.I'm not sure where your tastes need to extend to enjoy this film. There are obviously a lot of people that like it, so advising that you not watch it is a bit too bold. It seems like one of those weird movies that some people would love and others would hate.

I've only seen one other Argento film and it wasn't too good either. Give me Bava or Fulci any day. This had a big kill scene at the beginning, and then lots of colorful sets and bad acting, a vague plot, and quite frankly, by the time it was over, I didn't care.I'd actually purchased this and it was the biggest disappointment I'd ever had in buying a DVD.",Suspiria
341,Volken,Exquisite visual splendor with forgiving shortcomings,9,2 June 2006,"One could hardly add anything of more substance that wasn't observed with previous comments reflecting a simply exquisite cinematography.Nothing but admiration is how I feel about visual side of this movie.There are couple of other points I wanted to mention, for I believe no one spoke of them earlier.Upon first alert of the lead actress Jessica Harper, I had to again verify by reading her name, just to dismiss my first impressions.She looks stingingly similar to actress Frances O'Connor, exact face structure and physique, for a moment I thought she is a young Frances O'Connor, or even that she changed her name to Frances at later date, strange indeed.I'm rather surprised nobody examined this similarity :) This brings me back to the Jessica Harper, I found inadequate amount of director's preparation of her initial performance.Even after dark introduction to her new academy, from the first scene, she adopted this dissonant and reserved aptitude which remains toward the end of the movie, and the same is certainly dismissing the sense of the dramatic contrast of someone who is about to enter the madness and fear itself.Very sterile and uncharacteristic presence, one I find highly undesirable considering its role , environment and story.She is a ballet dancer, vigor, young, full of life, we should have seen this embodied in beginning of the movie, then all this would create contrast while being in new found state of nightmare at academy. We should have seen this changed, sadly, she enters and departures the story with same and fragile vain expression. Pity.Also, I find rather banal Argento insisted that in this supernatural story, the killings where employed with cold weaponry, making it very prosaic indeed, banal I say considering the promise of the movie as such.Research of witches is also nonexistent, with superb visual splendor should have been complemented with the same amount of witchcraft research.Nevertheless , impressive creation.One you ought to experience for yourself",Suspiria
342,sabenge,A must-see for horror fans,7,11 February 2008,"Alternately chilling and comical, this is easily one of Argento's best.The story itself is basically a paint by numbers of horror movies before it, involving an American girl in Germany studying ballet, but what really sets it apart is the atmosphere. In Argento's earlier movies, he used a lot of darkness to achieve tension. However, Suspiria takes a different approach, displaying vivid colors to heighten the terror.The score, as usual in Argento undertakings, is done by the Goblins. Personally, I felt that Deep Red was ruined because of their contributions, but this time they pleasantly surprised me. The music managed to fit in rather than stick out here.Truly enjoying this movie is a matter of forgiving the dialogue and plot and simply appreciating the artistic accomplishments of a horror movie that proves to be as beautiful as it is scary.",Suspiria

I know, Argento is some kind of a master, and his daughter is hot, and this movie is famous, and...it just is not very scary, particularly in the middle parts.  It isn't terrible.  I give it a six.  Some characters are well-drawn, and the beginning and ending are very tense.  I think Tenebre was more terrifying, and I am sure lots of Argento's other work would appeal to me.  But I  didn't think Suspiria was that great, and I won't see it again.",Suspiria

The maggot scene and the room of barbed wire really stand out as some of the funniest in horror history, though the scene with the professor is particularly delicious for its pretentiousness, using oblique camera angles in a misguided attempt to be unsettling, but winning awards instead for best comedy performance by Jessica Harper's hair.

347,MelliDan,Unlike anything else in the horror genre,10,22 May 2021,"What can I say about this unique trip into paranoia that hasn't already been said? Well, first of all, I just watched it for the first time and I was literally hypnotized by it, unable to look away from the screen. Dario Argento's 'Suspiria' is unlike any other horror film I have ever seen.His use of colors and imagery is like looking at a kaleidoscope; the landscape of this film is stunning. This is not a typical bleak, dark horror film that relies on shadows and jump scares - no, no! 'Suspiria' is very bright, aesthetically pleasing to the eye yet very much in your face. Also, the use of sound is largely something that makes this film so terrifying. As our main protagonist delves deeper and deeper into the mystery behind this ballet school, Argento masterfully lets the tension gradually rise and rise.... Some scenes are so quiet and tense that you feel compelled to hold your breath. Then when the horror kicks in, you'll be open-mouthed in shock. This sure is Dario Argento's vision; we're witnessing a director who has his full creative confidence on display.The music. Oh man, what a beautiful score. It is a collaboration between Goblin and Argento that is awe-inspiring, not only because it indicates the dread to come throughout the film but because it stays in your head long after the credits roll. It's as iconic as the beer horror film scores out there.The performances are stellar. Right from the start, the characters are engaging, somehow intriguing yet sinister at the same time. The weirdness of the hierarchy at the school makes you want to keep watching and figure this out as much as our heroine does.At this point, this is a legendary film. As a lifelong horror fan and first time viewer, I get it. Flawless, scary and very memorable. I can't wait to see it again.",Suspiria
348,joyomi,All style with no substance.,6,23 July 2018,"An American girl goes to Germany to a prestigious ballet boarding house, only to find out its controlled by a coven of witches. The movie has good style and atmosphere, but that's about it. There is no memorable story, and it feels disjointed and random. I don't care about any of these characters, since there is no development. The best thing about this film is the bright colors and the last 20 minutes were pretty tense and actually quite creepy. The kills are also pretty gory for the time. So yeah, Suspiria has good style and atmosphere, but lacks a story and characters. The only character I will remember from this is the blind piano player and the nasty dance instructor, everyone else is forgettable. It is worth a watch just to see the creepy dance academy and all the strange colors, but that's about it.",Suspiria

350,dave118118,Stunning!,10,3 April 2013,"The first thing that really hits you about this classic horror film is the score. I've read up a bit about it since watching and it was composed by a group called 'Goblin'. Possibly the greatest, creepiest score I've ever heard in a horror film. Coupled with the movies great sense of lighting and visuals, it makes for an endearing psychological, suspense driven horror film. Sometimes with an element of elegance. Although the stand out element of the movie is the sound, there are some horrific deaths, the opening murders in particular were extremely violent and Dario Argento isn't afraid to show the gore. The two main female characters begin to unearth some secrets about the ballet school they're living in. What are the secrets? A question that will intrigue any viewer enough to be gripped right until the climax. A must for those who like the classics, Suspiria is best enjoyed in a dark room, with the volume turned right up (preferably with surround sound).",Suspiria

Even the gore fails to elicit anything other than eye rolling, because it's so obviously fake and so comically over the top. It isn't nightmarish, and it isn't dreamy; it's tedious, lacking any kind of characters we might actually care about and any kind of narrative drive from an actual story.

352,Denny,original and artistic!,10,27 June 1999,"I have never before finished watching a movie, just sitting there with my mouth hanging wide open like I did after viewing Suspiria.  The beginning of the movie is completely gripping with an originally gruesome double murder. The plot is rather hard to follow at times, but throughout the entire movie I could not wait to find out who or what the directress really was.  Some of the most original death scenes I've ever seen were in Suspiria, (two words: metal coils).  This was the first movie I've ever walked away from completely enthralled by the artistic aspects.  I have never seen more artistically effective camera angles, and Argento's use of color is purely an amazing work of art.  I highly recommend this movie, if anything, because of the incredibly camera work and lighting.  This movie is gripping and gruesome, but you won't regret seeing it!",Suspiria
353,kenny194,A flawed masterpiece,9,26 March 2000,"I just saw Suspiria for the first time last night, and I was extremely impressed.  Every shot is beautifully photographed, all the sets are great to look at, and it's well paced enough that you can really get caught up in the suspense of what's going on.  But what about that music?Almost everyone who commented on this movie praised the music, but I felt that it ruined many key scenes.  Sure, it's creepy music that lets you know that something tense is going on, but that's not necessary in this film at all.  Example:  There's a scene where someone is being chased through a large building, and she manages to put a latched door between herself and the killer.  As she searches for a way out of the room, the killer attempts to lift the latch using a straight razor, causing a bone-chilling scraping noise.  This would have been one of the best scenes I have ever seen in a movie if all you could hear were the girl's struggles and that scraping. But no, there's this horrible music blaring so loudly that you can think of nothing else.  This happens all too frequently in the film, where the characters are in total silence, trying to listen to something like footsteps or snoring, which you couldn't possibly hear while watching it because of the music.  Abominable.",Suspiria
354,phoenix2rachelsummers,Dario Argento embraces fantasy and creates his first horror masterpiece (SPOILERS),10,16 February 2006,"Once the success of Deep Red (Profondo Rosso) had catapulted Italian filmmaker Dario Argento to the top of his profession, it must have seemed like there were no limits to the possibilities for his follow-up film. And here is where the true authorship of Suspiria becomes a gray area.Daria Nicolodi, who played the female lead in Deep Red, had begun an affair with Argento, which would result in one child (a daughter, Asia Argento, who would grow up to become a successful actress and filmmaker) and a volatile romance/creative collaboration. According to Nicolodi, it was she who encouraged Argento to break out of the murder mystery mold and move into horror fantasy. Furthermore, she claims that Suspiria's story, of a German dance academy awash in black magic, was inspired by true-life tales told to her by her grandmother. In the end, Nicolodi came away with a screen writing credit, but only after fighting Argento tooth and nail over the credit.Of what there is no doubt is that the fanciful premise of Suspiria inspired Argento to new peaks of visual creativity. Using a special process to print the film in Golden Age of Hollywood Technicolor, Argento and cinematographer Luciano Tovoli splash their canvas in primary colors of such richness that the viewer can almost taste them. The over-the-top camera movements and editing from Deep Red were taken even further over-the-top in Suspiria, into a dimension of pure cinematic delirium. The gore which had been mostly implied in Deep Red now splashed all over the screen.Scoring their second Argento film (the first being Deep Red), Italian rock band Goblin provide the icing on the cake, with an eerily childlike refrain segueing seamlessly into brutal percussion, chants, and Claudio Simonetti's sheer keyboard madness.Even Argento's worst flaws as a filmmaker -- bad acting and lack of plot -- actually work in this fantasy context. Jessica Harper and Stefania Cassini make two-dimensional yet likable heroines, while Alida Valli and Golden Age of Hollywood icon Joan Bennett gleefully chew the scenery as the villainesses. And where Deep Red blurred the lines between reality and nightmare, Suspiria brazenly flies into a world nothing like the one we live in.Argento has feted the classic Disney cartoon Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as Suspiria's main forebear, but I think Suspiria could be more accurately described as a psychotic funhouse-mirror reflection of The Wizard of Oz. Argento made a few more good films (and one more great one) after Suspiria, but his unique cinematic vision was never clearer than it was here. Perhaps if Argento had been more willing to give Nicolodi proper credit, then Argento might not have peaked so early?",Suspiria

From the mixed reviews I've seen, it's obvious this film is like Marmite -- You either love it or hate it.Unfortunately it did very little for me. I really wanted to like it, but I was 5-years-old when this movie came out and I've seen dozens, more recent horror pictures before I finally arrived at this one. As a result, I am only able to appreciate this as a classical piece of film art from the past as I'm unable to feel as entertained as I would watching the likes of, say, The Sixth Sense.The pace is slow and fairly boring. The ""guts and gore"" elements are infrequent, unsophisticated and relatively tame (compared to recent material).That being said, I was impressed with the cinematography -- Although the flamboyant use of theatrical colour could be interpreted as pretentious or magical depending on how you view the film.Soundtrack was quite excellent in my view.

Where do I begin? There was a plot line yes, but the execution was so diabolical a 5 year old could have written the screen-play.The acting was beyond reprehensible, stiff and wooden through-out, the main protagonist needs some serious acting lessons before being considered for another lead role.Every single one of the killings looked blatantly obvious that is was a dummy, the scene with the guide dog killing it's owner, and the girl falling into the barbed wire were probably the best death scenes and that is only because the audience isn't subjected to tomato ketchup blood straight away.All in all, if there was ever going to be a cure for insomnia, this is it!",Suspiria

The movie on big screen looks so much better than on TV: the main strengths are the camera work, the oversaturated colours, the use of light and the excellent soundtrack are amplified in a cinema and many little things that seem irrelevant. Like in most Argento's movie the plot is quite thin, and the script shows a certain naivety in certain parts, however the idea behind the movie is intriguing and of the ""Mother's trilogy"" Suspiria is definitely the best one. I understand that in the age of Transformers, CGI etc...Suspiria might result simplistic, not gory enough etc...but the tension buildup thanks to the music is simply amazing, unfortunately I feel people under 25 can't really appreciate it as well as other classics of the same era like Carpenter's Halloween, but the connoisseurs will appreciate this all female dark fantasy in technicolor.",Suspiria

For starters, better scripts have been seen out there, the acting is certainly nothing to write home about, the fake blood looks extra cheap and the list could go on and on.But then there's the stuff they got right. There's literally only a handful of killings throughout as the low body count meant they could elaborate more on every single one of the gore scenes. That means the old 'get stupid character do stupid things and do away with them in the next scene' routine is nowhere to be found in this giallo classic. Argento's direction is nothing short of superb and to top it all off, there's that haunting score, easily one of the best I've come across in the genre and possibly this movie's single greatest asset.",Suspiria

So 5 years on I finally get it on DVD and hoped it lived up to its hype and yes it did so and soon entered my top 10 horror movies. Beautifully fantastic.Plot: American ballet student Suzy Bannion arrives at a famous Berlin ballet academy, where she gradually comes to realize that the teachers of the school are not quite what they would appear.Hot or Not: This film is brilliant and it was finally good to see a horror film that was generally really creepy and not focused on gore. It has a real atmosphere to it that draws you in like only the true great horror films have and this is all down to the brilliant directing of Draio Argento in what is his definitive picture. This films shows why he is the true master of Euro horror.The Music Is wonderful, a total score created by the Goblins. It is very creepy and is up there with the Halloween and Exorcist sound tracks. Thankfully Dario keeps away from the cheesy porn music that many Italian films tend to incorporate within their films. The main tracks really build tension.Yes the film does have some gore, but not to much and it is used in the right amounts. The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't need gore to carry it.The directing is fantastic, the use of colour is wonderful and real adds a surreal feel to the film that brings an unconscious creepiness, it feels like you re trapped with in a bad dream. The use of the camera is brilliant, especially in the opening scene.Birds and the Bees: None what so ever. A films with loads of hot women, you would expect a little but no.Acting: Jessica Harper (Suzy) Is really good and convincing in her performance, you really grow to like her.

364,argento6,Delicious!,10,22 June 2016,"In 1978, legendary Italian, Master of the Murder/Mystery and Horror Dario Argento Directed Suspiria. One of the most important movie in the history of movies (Since Les Frères Lumière invented the Medium) in my opinion. And it stands as one of the best films ever made.This one is surely one of the scariest and most disturbing movies i've ever seen. My favorite entry in the genre and probably my favorite movie period, all styles and genres involved. Although Argento's work has never been praised for the quality of his actors and scripts, neither for his stories and plots (Stories made no sense and mostly in Suspiria. This one is also filled with plot holes.) But i honestly think no one should really care to understand an horror movie but he/she should expect from it to be scary, gory or disturbing and nothing more.But the work of Argento himself and the effort he puts into making each scene his own, filming it and then the editing, in big part all his own unique way make this filmmaker a man apart from everyone else. You can name them all, but none of them can make horror movies and scenes as beautiful as Argento more than often did during his illustrious career, which didn't start with and didn't end with Suspiria. But this one in particular- The first of a trilogy dedicated to 3 witches, each one haunting an ancient residence- is surely the biggest film he's done in terms of making a name for himself. His originality and love of music showed throughout most of his following movies. But Suspiria's music and sounds were rarely matched in the genre.Dario loves to play with his actors and his camera crew. He loves to play with colours and he won't hesitate to show his audience the most gruesome death scenes in such a elegant way (Say for the first murder scene in Suspiria). He's one of the master at using and even overusing the old clichés and he does it pretty well and without shame. Back during the days when the Murder/Mystery and Horror flicks were still fresh, scary and fun, Argento was arguably the master at it.The story 4 Suspiria: Suzie Banyon (Jessica Harper) is a young American that came to a prestigious Ballet school in Germany. But the European Dance Academy runned by Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) hides some sinister secret. Indeed, one so dark that those who find out about it or try to escape are killed off one by one.If the story, actors and even the voice overs could have been much better (In English, i recommend the french version which was really good) these are the only flaws. This witch tale is guaranteed to stay buried deep within the minds of many viewers and todays paranormal flicks could never stand an inch tall in front of this masterpiece. The flicks trying to pay Suspiria the smallest homage or the smallest amount of respect, taking their inspiration from this flick have for the most part failed miserably sadly.So, that you like or not Horror, Suspense, Mystery and Giallo movies, you should give this one a shot and instead of judging it for its acting and writing talents, just judge it based on the effort put forth behind the camera, the way the movie was rendered and how this all helps tell the story from the start. The Images, the colours, the score. Because i think i heard that from someone once and i Totally agree and quote: ""Not liking Suspiria, is the same as not liking cinema/movies at all.""Devilishly Delicious!!

In fact the skeleton in the trailer doesn't even appear in the film, so in a sense the trailer lied. The first kill in Suspiria is the high point of the whole movie. After that there's a lull in action and terror. So much for being a ""classic."" I'm not too thrilled about seeing another Argento film after seeing his ""masterpiece.""

There are reasons he's not known in the US - his films are too...well, European.  Very stylistic, but lacking in any excitement, tension, plot, or story.  The movie is a big, long, painting.  If you wanna just look at the TV for a couple hours, and you're fine with just looking and not watching, this is the movie for you.I can't say this movie is without merit, because it isn't.  If it weren't for this movie, there would be no ""Halloween.""  Stylistically speaking, ""Halloween"" takes a lot of its visual substance from this movie, and I'm sure it's influenced many other movies as well.  The story, what little of it there is, is poorly acted and hard to follow.  Most of the story is dull and completely unengaging, but that's clearly not what the director had intended.  I can't tell you what he did intend, because I can't figure it out.If schlocky European crap-horror is your bag, this is the movie for you. If not, go to your local video store and burn all copies of this movie.  That would make me, and hopefully you, feel better about this uninspired movie.",Suspiria
367,raif,The only thing scarier than this movie...,5,19 February 2002,"... was the fact that I was duped into buying it without seeing it first.  I had read several reviews of Suspiria. Most of them praised the movie. There were a few in there that bashed the movie but by the time I got to them it was too late.  I was already hooked. I had taken the bait.  I am a sucker for a good horror movie.  I had heard about Dario Argento's reputation for being a serious horror film maker.  Since none of the movie rental stores in my town carried Suspiria in any format I was forced to buy it sight unseen. I rushed to the closest Video store and found two DVD versions of the film. There the the run of the mill regular DVD and the super 3 disc set.  Hey, anything with a special edition set like that can't be that bad.  Or so I thought.  After serious pleading with my girlfriend I convinced her to sit and watch it with me.  By the end of the movie I was just sitting there frowning at the TV while being nagged about buying such a piece of garbage. A story about witches and a dance school... I should have seen the red flags right there.  I'm not even going to trash the horrible acting (it is after all a horror movie).  I'm going to trash the lame story and lack of... suspense.  There was absolutely no climax.  The end felt rushed and I was like ""Was that it?"".I am usually very easy to please with movies.  I can sit through garbage or superb films.  This movie not only stole close to 30 bucks from me but also an hour and a half of my life and I want them both back.If you are like me and are looking through these reviews to find out if it is a good movie or not, don't be fooled like I was, save your money and your time.  You'll be happier in the end.",Suspiria
368,Victo_64,A Big Disappointment,2,31 May 2009,"Suspiria is (in my opinion), the most over-rated horror movie ever. It has some amazing music, and the set is fantastic, but the music is always playing, and it is always the same music. It is really slow, for example: at the beginning they follow the car for like 5 minutes on the way to the academy, and there is no talking (just music). There are many, many other times when they do the same sort of thing. It is so far in the movie where you actually get to see the witches too. The special effects are absolutely terrible ( so terrible I felt embarrassed that I even picked that movie out ). I wasn't expecting the effects to be amazing of course, and I love lots of movies with bad effects, but this was so bad that I couldn't just try and not notice that they were bad, because it was impossible to miss. So if you want to watch a good old classic horror movie, watch The Exorcist or The Omen or The Evil Dead, or anything else. But if extremely slow, boring movies that focus mostly on music, and terrible effects sounds like something you might enjoy, then you should still give it a try. It must have a good rating for a reason.2/10",Suspiria
369,slaterspins,The best horror film I've ever seen,10,23 April 2009,"Well, this one's it for me. As a horror movie fan since I was a kid, and one who's seen plenty of horror films, this is probably my favorite. I remember going to the theater when this was first released and sitting there stunned and watching it twice in a row. I'd never seen anything like it. I was an Argento fan and expected this to be a giallo like BIRD and CAT, both of which I'd seen on TV and liked. I was unprepared for the fact that here the killer wasn't a suspect in the school but a witch, one of the three mothers, and that this wasn't a standard giallo, but a supernatural horror film made in a totally original style. Needless to say, it's become a classic since I first saw it, and I'm not surprised, because at the time I first saw it I recognized I was seeing something stupendous in the horror genre. The haunting tale seemed a contemporary update of Val Lewton's mysterious, ghostly films - an update with mind-bending color, operatic violence, incredible 'set pieces' and cinematic magic. Since then I've been quite an Argento fan and loved his supernatural follow-up INFERNO almost as much. The recent long anticipated end to the first two parts of his THREE MOTHERS trilogy was a terrible disappointment. If only he'd made it right after INFERNO when he was in the groove...but then we might never have had TENEBRAE, a superb giallo. Let's forget genre for a minute. This film is an intensely realized, dazzling piece of cinema that has lost none of its power over time.",Suspiria
370,BogieandBacallfan,Psychedelic Horror At Its Best!!,8,24 April 2011,"I had not ever heard of or seen this awesome, bizarre little horror flick until recently. I purchased a DVD and am truly glad I did! ""Suspiria"" definitely is the most bizarre but beautiful or mesmerizing horror movie I've ever seen! Usually most attribute psychedelic colors used in strange ways or outlandish situations (art, clothes, effects of hallucinatory drugs, etc...) to the late 60's and the whole hippie generation. However, this delightful little Italian slasher uses that medium superbly to its advantage in the late 70's.The cinematography, color, lighting, sets, bizarre music, terrifying chanting, etc...are awesome and truly ""make"" this movie. The plot itself is a little over the top, and the acting is not that wonderful either. But, this movie is not meant to be Shakespeare--it's meant to be a scary horror flick with unrealistic, fantastical people and places. The scares are also very effective, and the strange colors and background music/chanting definitely helped make the feeling that much more ominous and terrifying! I would recommend ""Suspiria"" to any true horror fan/collector and it's truly a colorful ""gem"" within the genre! It's become quite a cult-classic over the years and now that I've seen it I can understand why!",Suspiria
371,harukahoneyh,Wow!,10,5 December 2000,"After seeing so many lousy films, I was ecstatic to find one I can rave about. I mean, I'm a horror fanatic, but there's so many that wouldn't scare a 2-year-old. I was reluctant to rent this because of just that, but went ahead when I saw Jessica Harper listed as the star. Though she doesn't sing in this, she's still fantastic and has that doll-like essence about her.
Aside from the the story and acting, it has a haunting, dreamlike atomosphere. The chilling music-box soundtrack and the beautiful Art Nouveau sets are hypnotic. (I was tickled to see illustrations by the great Aubrey Beardsley in the background!) It's just spellbinding! You get a sense of being drugged like the main character is.You won't be disappointed! It is a creepy masterpiece of the macabre. Be warned, it's not for the faint of heart. Though no splatterfest, it gets very gory in the death scenes. Other than the typical depiction of us witches as all evil, I have no complaints about this film.",Suspiria
372,swinms,See it for Joan's sake,6,13 April 2007,"This movie is fascinating and beautifully done. However, it's really just a 70s Italian horror flick. The main reason to see it is that it's Joan Bennett's last movie. I wonder how they got her to do it. I hope she didn't need the money. She's wonderful as the prim and starchy head mistress of the ballet school. She can certainly pull off horror - just watch a couple of Dark Shadows episodes. Beautiful and talented (and funny) Joan Bennett in her last feature film. That's reason enough for any film lover to see Suspiria. I truly loved the sets and the creepy music but it wasn't the genre which enticed me to see this movie. It was the lure of seeing one of the great legends of the silver screen in her last performance. This film shows clearly that Joan Bennett was a professional and a true star to the end.",Suspiria
373,MaterSuspiriorum,A Masterpiece.,10,10 September 2006,"Suspiria stands out among the work of Argento because it is simply the best film of his career to date, and a truly brilliant film in itself. This film clearly displays Argento fantastic visual style, his attention to detail and his way of telling a story visually, rather then through dialog. The film is the most beautiful film I have ever seen, as it was shot on Eastman Color Kodak stock and was printed using the 3-strip Technicolor process, giving it an 3-D effect. This film stands as not only a monument to the genius of Argento but the film's photographer Luciano Tovoli.Dario Argento influences culminate in this, his sixth film. It can clearly be noted that his main influence was his mentor, Mario Bava (Black Sunday). Argento made Bava's famous tracking shot his own, and this has become one of Argento's many signatures.People say that Suspiria does not have a plot, but it does, although it is a simple one. I think it is genius of Argento not to focus to much on plot, as the audience will probably be trying to figure the story out if the plot for Suspiria was complex, therefore, they would pay little attention to how visual stunning Suspiria is, and this would sour the experience of watching Suspiria.The acting in Suspiria I adored. Jessica Harper is perfection as Suzy, her innocence radiating out brilliantly. The supporting cast are just simply brilliant, especially Alida Valli and Joan Bennett.This film is simply a masterpiece.",Suspiria
374,goshin34,"Horrible music, mediocre acting, stale plot",1,22 August 2012,"Some of the most horrible soundtrack music I've ever heard, so poorly done that sometimes the ""music"" (cacophonus noise more like) was hurting your ears and yet you could not hear the dialog. Literally, the soundtrack often sounded like distant screams mixed with clashing chimes and someone dropping a ton of sheet metal on concrete. Mediocre acting: so much of the dialog sounded contrived and artificial, and was often delivered in either a wooden fashion or an overly melodramatic or hyper-emotionalized manner. Stale plot: I can't say much without giving the whole movie away, since there is not much to the plot at all... suffice it to say that it is overused, trite and unimaginative. I expect the only thing it had going for it at the time (1977) was a certain shock value to what was (then) blood and gore... by modern standards pretty tame. The lead female actress was competent, cute and sympathetic, but that wasn't nearly enough to redeem this film. On the whole, don't waste your time. I have no idea why some consider this movie a horror classic. Evil Dead, just to name one from the same decade, is vastly superior.",Suspiria

Apparently the were either smoking some good herb while watching this film, or saw some other version that I can't rent.This is about a girl that goes to a dance school in germany and weird things start to happen and people start to die while she is there. That is the one sentence plot summary and believe me that that is the entire story.Why did this movie suck so bad you ask? You can see the jump scenes coming from a mile away, the blood is so fake you can smell the paint, the acting isn't all that great, and the ""gore"" scenes aren't gory.The only thing that is scary about this film is the sound track. Those of you that have been to ""Halloween Horror Night"" at Universal Studios in Florida will recognize it right off the bat. It is the same music they play when you enter the park to start your night. The sound track bought back alot of kewl memories and it was really chilling to hear Zombie's original version.In conclusion, only watch this film if someone else flips the tab for it.

But it is not enough, because apart from these things the movie is plain stupid. With some ideas borrowed from Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby""(an infinitely superior film), and an artificial script, the movie fails to leave an impression because of it's lack of substance. There is nothing insightful here, characters are poorly portrayed, the lines are childish, and the beautiful sets and truly excellent music determined me to expect something more when in fact it wasn't.

It is a good movie and I consider it as one of the best in Dario Argentos body of work. But as in other movies by the Italian horror maestro the main problem lies in the bad writing (which is even enhanced in the English version). The movie tells the story of Susie (Jessica Harper), a young American ballerina who arrives in Germany to study at a dance academy. After several bad things (including worms falling from the ceiling and of course some nasty killings) have happened there she finally finds out that it is run by witches. Yes, that's it, there is not much more of a story here!! Beyons these ""problems"" (bad writing and thin story line) Argento made a nightmarish masterpiece which he knows well how to orchestrate: He uses great camera work, effective lighting and music to create atmosphere.",Suspiria

Older movies still rule, but film today is nothing like what it used to be...Except for the horror genre.I am a lover of horror movies, and it breaks my heart to walk through the video store and see the crap that has been released in the recent 2 decades. Horror has become a joke, since the 70s.When I first read about this film, it definitly sounded interesting.  I searched and searched, before I finally gave up and forgot about it. However, I was amazed to find this films 3-disk collectors set in my local Borders, so I quickly snatched up the copy and spent the last of my birthday money.It is amazing how a movie can be so boring, that you think you are going to die, yet it still keeps you at the edge of your seat.  The few murder scenes had my eyes bulging from their sockets.  The gore was so unbelievable, it is hard to think of a description that doesnt include at least a dozen curses in them.Every second of this film had me waiting, tensely, to see what would happen next.

When this movie came out, I was only a child, and I remember the commercials vividly---scared me out of my wits!! I remember many of my relatives seeing this film and trying to describe it to me, but for obvious reasons that just can't be done---it's something you have to see and experience for yourself. I think perhaps the negative comments come from people who haven't seen the widescreen version in it's full surround sound. Years later when I was old enough to see this, I was blown away!! The story, the design, the music, the mystery---instantly made me a Dario Argento fan (and also influenced me to become an actor and writer of the macabre!). European countries have such an ethereal feel and look to them, which only intensifies the overall effect of the film. I backpacked around Europe when I was in my twenties----I saw buildings, streets, areas very similar to what's in the film. Remember also that there's soooooooo much more history in these countries, and that the black arts have been part of their cultural history. I'm not going to retread the story line at all here, but this movie, along with many other European horror films of that era (like, ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie"", etc) are to me much more creative, horrifying, and better made than the American counterparts. Every film Dario Argento has created, to me at any rate, rank up there with the best-of-the-best---they're all obviously labors of love, but Suspiria shines above the rest. As far as a remake, unless Dario's directing, why even bother?",Suspiria

I ran to a local video store and rented it and whew was it bad!! I found it almost impossible to follow.  80% of the movie is focused on the main actress and her dance recitals.

I was so excited when I finally got my copy in the mail and all I can say is, ""What a disappointment"". First the positives. Argento's use of bright colors and dark settings is a sort of eye candy that keeps you attentive. The murder scenes are rather gory though not too realistic looking by today's standards. The one excellent aspect of this film is the score. Absolutely creepy. Which Argento over uses to the point of ridicule. What the film lacked the most was substance. I know its an over used term but ""All style and no substance"", describes this film to a tee. The acting was less than mediocre to say the least.

Some of the acting and writing was A for effort. The story didn't feel like it was going anywhere until the movie was almost over. I realize that there are two movies after this one, but I don't feel compelled to watch them. Disappointed because Dario Argento's talent was not put to use in the best movie.

With the freaky music score and visuals, it keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Unlike the slasher films where it's all about blood and body count, Suspiria captures the viewer with so much more.  Of course, it has its gore, but it's of a different style.  You want to squirm, but you want to watch and are intrigued by what is happening and why it's happening.  Argento uses little details that make all the difference.  I've watched it several times, and each time I discover something I didn't notice before.  The only negative thing I'd say about Suspiria is poor dialogue and also the fact that it gives false information about what witchcraft is (obviously due to misconception by the writers).  Aside from that, Suspiria is an excellent film!!  A truly horrifying horror film!!  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a true horror film.  One without corny Freddy Krueger-type jokes.

388,whiggles,"Forget Halloween, forget Scream, you MUST see Suspiria.",10,21 April 2003,"Spoiler Alert Suspiria is certainly not the type of film that will appeal to the average moviegoer, as it is about as far from the Hollywood model as can be, both in terms of storytelling and cinematography. If you approach this film expecting it to be a horror movie in the same model as Scream, A Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween, you'll be sorely disappointed, as Suspiria is a much stronger assault on the viewers' senses, and makes no attempt to conform to the rules of the genre.Suspiria is more or less a fairytale. Many classic gothic elements are present throughout, such as the main character, Suzy, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Snow White. She arrives in Freiburg in Germany in the middle of a massive thunderstorm, planning on studying at the famous Dance Academy. Upon reaching the academy, she witnesses another girl running out, screaming incoherently, and is subsequently told by voice on the intercom to get lost. Within a short amount of time, we see the runaway girl and a friend with whom she is staying meet their end in one of the most original and brutal murders ever to be filmed. As disturbing things continue to happen in and around the school, Suzy becomes more and more aware that what appears to be a respectable dance academy is actually a cover-up for occult worship...Little is explained about what's happening. For example, the first girl to die (Pat) is killed by an unseen assailant with large, hairy arms. We never find out who the killer is. In fact, we never find out who any of the killers are. We know (eventually) that it is the witches that are making these things happen, but we don't know who the actual perpetrators are. But in a way, does anything need to be explained? Bad things don't necessarily happen for a reason: the impression I am under is that the witches are simply intent on spreading evil and destruction, with little motivation.This is definitely one of the most incredible looking films I have ever seen. The colors are completely surreal, with bright reds, blues and yellows lighting many of the scenes. I suspect that these colors are used to suggest the presence of ""evil""; yet, the characters don't seem to be aware of them. Blood is bright red, but this adds to the style rather than detracting from it. The whole story is so unbelievable anyway that it's perfectly normal to accept that blood is bright red and looks a lot like thick paint.I also have to mention the incredible music by the group ""Goblin"". The simple theme tune that is repeated throughout the movie is quite similar to the one John Carpenter composed for Halloween, but in my opinion this score is far and away the better of the two. The hypnotic soundtrack is filled with barely-decipherable screams and chants, the best example being the word ""Witch!"" which is frequently hissed, especially during the opening scenes.Let's be fair, the actual story is pretty far-fetched, and some of the dialogue and acting is laughable. This isn't helped by the fact that almost the entire film was recorded silent, and dubbed later (a process that many Italian filmmakers continued right up until the mid 1980s). However, this doesn't seem to matter. The visuals and aurals, and the genuine atmosphere and heavy stylization, completely mask the scenario deficits. That's why I'm giving this movie FIVE STARS: because it completely works within context. It has faults, yes, but its pros make up for its cons, completely dazzling you. Forget Halloween, forget Scream, you MUST see Suspiria.Overall: 9 out of 10",Suspiria

This would have been perfect MST3K fodder.  The brutal dubbing, Olga the Super Bitch (in a very brief cameo I guess), the murdering of the word ""occult"" (pronounced 'OCK-pause-cult' in this movie), and the teeth. . my God the teeth!  The Romanian butler guy looked like Lurch's homely cousin with dentures, and the dance instructor's choppers were reminiscient of Matt Dillon's in 'What About Mary?'

I tracked down a copy.  And I don't get it.I guess because it came out before the other ""slasher"" films of the '70s, is stylishly filmed,  and is foreign, it's been hailed as some sort of masterpiece on the genre.  I watch horror movies because I like to be scared, and gruesome deaths and gore don't equal suspense in my opinion. There are a few incredibly disgusting murders in this movie.  If you don't like sadistic murders and bloody violence you probably won't like this movie; if you do like sadistic murders and bloody violence there probably aren't enough of them to hold your interest.The movie is about an American who goes to Germany to study dance at a prestigious school.  Strange things begin to happen. most of which make no sense and are never explained.  Is Susie losing her mind or is the school actually run by a coven of witches?  The movie IS beautifully filmed, and there IS a maintained sense of foreboding; but the dialogue and the situations are ridiculous.  The main character continually makes stupid choices, clues fall right into her lap, which lead her into ridiculously contrived situations.  Few of the `scary' scenes have anything to do with what is actually going on at the school, so at the end the viewer is left with a whole lot of unanswered questions.I had probably just heard too much about the film and the director before I actually saw the movie.  My expectations were just too high, I guess.  In the end, to me, `Suspiria' wasn't any better than a `Friday the 13th' movie with a really, really good cinematographer.

391,DjangoLeone,"Argento's ""Suspiria"" *minor spoilers*",9,2 January 2005,"About a year or so ago, my friend bought the DVD of Suspiria because we both had wanted to see it. I watched a documentary about the director, Dario Argento, and was interested in seeing what is considered his best film. I heard in an interview with Alice Cooper that he thought Suspiria was one of the scariest movies ever... quite an achievement if Mr. ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" thinks it's a frightening film. Well we never got around to seeing the film until a few weeks ago it was on IFC so I was excited. However, I didn't find this film overly scary. It's the story of an American ballet dancer, Susie, who goes to a prestigious, if not all together creepy, ballet school in Germany. Right from the start there's some strange things happening and within a few minutes there's two dead people, killed in quite inventive ways. As the story goes on, Susie starts finding clues about witches and evil at the school, which of course leads to the thrilling conclusion. Surely it's visually stunning and relatively violent (far less violence than I expected). The thing this film had an abundance of was suspense and mystery. So mysterious, in fact, that I still wonder why witches would need to use a knife to kill people. Wouldn't they just cast a spell or something? Of course, I'm no witch. The constant and repetitive score (by Goblin and Argento himself) is quite unnerving and succeeds in heightening suspense. Overall it was an enjoyable film, if only for the striking visuals. Argento certainly makes gore seem like art. I only wish there was more. Does that make me weird?",Suspiria
392,adamd164,Terrifying,9,2 January 2006,"Suspiria is without a doubt the scariest movie I have ever seen. ***SPOILER***The plot is a relatively straight-forward one: we follow a young girl (Jessica Harper) who travels to a German dance academy, only to find that all is not as it seems - it is run by a coven of witches.***END OF SPOILER***However, its simplicity should not put you off - as with most Argento films, the plot is just there to tie the amazing visuals and creepy music together. From start to finish, SUSPIRIA retains a genuinely scary atmosphere and several moments are unbearably tense.Argento masterfully draws the attention of the viewer from the very first scene to the last and leaves them in an almost hypnotic state. Many may try, but few succeed, and this one certainly belongs in the latter category.Rating: 10/10. For horror fans, this is a must-see!",Suspiria
393,preb1,"I'm probably a retard, but this is not a great horror movie.",5,17 August 2006,"This is the first Argento movie I've seen. I don't think it's gonna be the last, but my effort to get to see another movie by him, are weakened. The positive things about this movie is first of all the musical score. Without that, the movie would have plummeted to the ground. The acting is...how shall I put it, theatrical. Unfortunely enough to make me disinterested. But the killing scenes in the movie are well above average for the rest of it. The plot is not there. It's just a girl dancing ballet and everyone around her dies. My biggest problem with this movie that it is not scary. I didn't quite see the phenomenal editing or cinematography either. It was descent for a 77 standard, but today it's just not that eye-catching. Mostly it is a huge gasp. My girlfriend fall asleep after half an hour. And I was really thinking about sleeping half way through. Fortunately a new killing saved me from it, and the terrific musical score. And that is the two things that hold this movie together and make it an average experience.",Suspiria
394,DistantJ,The only thing more terrifying than the last twelve minutes of Suspiria... Are the first ninety-two.,8,10 June 2005,"There was a lot of Hoopla about this film on all of the horror websites I've seen. The cover of the DVD says ""One of the scariest movies ever made..."", but I've learned it's wise to ignore that over-used line because it's usually bullshit and sets your expectations way higher for the film. But who could resist buying a fairytale film by Italo-lunatic Argento, especially one which is referred to as his 'masterpiece'? Our heroine Suzi Banyon, an American girl with a serious need for some eyebrow plucking, moves into a dance school in Germany, but grisly murders begin to occur there, and she discovers that the school has a dark, supernatural secret...The film opens so well. Right from the beginning there's a sense of dread, the killer eerie music by Goblin feels amazingly ominous and may even remind you of the opening of Mike Oldfield's masterpiece ""Tubular Bells"", which was used so well in ""The Exorcist"", and achieves the same eerie feeling.A few moments into the movie we are treated to an extremely frightening scene involving a window (but doesn't involve catching Rosie O'Donnell changing with the curtains open, there is a limit to how scary these films can be), which then breaks into what has to be one of the most original death scenes I have seen. A sign of things to come? Let's hope so.For the rest of the movie we see some more stylised kills, though none of them quite living up to the first one. However, what drives this film is the tension and atmosphere. I remember years and years ago, seeing the sexy ass French lesbian Vampire film, ""Shiver of the Vampires"", and admiring the atmosphere, in particular the use of red lighting in some scenes, where you wouldn't really find red light. The thing is, coloured light effects are actually not very common at all in modern horror films - they're scrapped in favour of realism, but in the sexy Vampire flick, when I wasn't too busy staring at the nude 70's French chicks, they worked a charm. Suspiria proved to me that the Italians can do that even better, and has provided me with a film which seems to be entirely based around using that kind of atmosphere, to extreme lengths.As with all of Dario Argento's movies, the acting and dialogue is, well, comedy genius. Of the unintended kind. Dario ain't great at English and it shows. He also likes to record the movie without sound and dub the voices on afterwards, which knocks the cheese factor up another 10 levels or so. He even allows some of his actors to speak in Italian to then be dubbed over in English, which causes some painfully bad lip sync.""The only thing more terrifying than the last twelve minutes of Suspiria, are the first ninety-two"", croaks the creepy voice-over man on the rather korny US theatrical trailer. There's actually an amusing irony to this little gimmick tag-line, as the end of the movie actually isn't quite as good as the rest. Just as the secrets are finally being uncovered, the final battle breaks out and is over before you know it. Questions are left unanswered, before you have even been given the time to ask the question. When our bushy eyebrowed heroine manages to destroy the 'final villain', you almost want to say ""was that it?"".Other than the slight cop-out of an ending, the film was great fun, and the atmosphere wins hands down and this instantly gets to sit in my 'favourites' list.Do yourself a favour and watch Suspiria in the dark. You just can't beat the atmosphere.",Suspiria
395,elinmagdalena,Primary colors don't save a bad film.,1,13 October 2008,"Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"" has been on my ""to watch""-list for several years, and I finally saw it yesterday.It tries desperately to be artistic, but to no good. It does have some fancy use of colors, and the photography is okay. But nothing, NOTHING, can save this film from the horrendous acting, the dumb dialog, the boring characters and the lame effects. Plus it seems Argento himself was either too busy with the color schemes to actually direct, or he was absent, mentally or otherwise. Goblins music is the only thing that keeps it from sinking completely to the bottom of Horrible Bad Movies.I rank it side by side with ""Jaws: The Revenge"", except this isn't even funny once.If it only had a self-mocking attitude, it might have been entertaining. But no, it takes itself too serious to be taken serious, so to speak.And any good director would have trimmed down the screen-time of a fake bat as soon as it becomes obvious it is plain silly looking.",Suspiria
396,eveflower1970,A Stylish Horror Masterpiece,8,18 November 2018,"After much thought given to it, I finally watched ""Suspiria"" (1977). To be honest, to the contemporary viewer, this movie may be also be considered a comedy, that is why I'm not going to (and neither should you) consider it by its ""scary"" sequences. More of a beautiful movie than a scary one, this 70's horror masterpiece blends both slasher and supernatural subgenres.
Why you should turn off the lights and watch this movie BEFORE you watch the 2018 remake:
it probably features the best lighting ever used in a horror movie (when I took notes watching the film, I wrote down hundreds of ""the light is stunning"" remarks)its musical score builds up suspense well, being both iconic and creepythe beautiful settings are outstanding all the time throught the film, blending very well with the lightingWhy you shouldn't watch this film if you're not a fan of old horror:
it features below average death scenes (but hey, it's the 70s)the blood used is way too bright to look realistic (Hammer-ish)from time to time it gets quite boringOne little detail that caught my eye, and I don't even know how on earth was I able to notice it, doesn't affect my opinion, but I feel the need to point it out:
In the scene in which the blind man plays piano, and the teacher interrupts him and shouts at him, he stops playing the piano and looks all around him, trying to figure out where the shouting comes from. Most blind people develop very good hearing, and therefore there would've been no need for him to look all around him to figure out where the teacher is shouting from.Conclusion: without its (beautiful) unnatural lighting, its thrilling musical scores and its outstanding settings, ""Suspiria"" (1977) wouldn't have been half of the horror masterpiece it is.",Suspiria
397,seti-66114,Great gift wrap but only socks inside...,5,30 June 2020,"Visuals: Looks good. The use of lighting is a strong point of the movie and gives it that supernatural feeling. It suits the theme.Sounds: The main theme is not too bad but it comes in way too often and inappropriately. The ""demon"" doing ""la la"" seems out of place and not very scary. The score tends to cut into into scenes and kind of disrupt them. Too loud and the timing is wrong.Technical: The cuts in the movie makes it feel like the movie was edited down to cut the run time. It is not very fluent and this movie would have needed more fluent editing to really build tension.Story: The core idea of the story is good. The only problem is that it just feels like too much time is spent on long, visual scenes that really doesn't add to the story and therefore the actual content of the story feels rushed and kind of predictable. The ending is really a joke. No clever twist? No big reveal of a sinister plan? Just abrupt and unsatisfying.Overall the movie bored me. The visuals are good and the actual plot is an interesting subject but this is really not one of the better executed stories in this vein.",Suspiria
398,Countess-2,"The best horror film there is, in my book.",10,19 November 1998,"That might sound a little strange, since I'm in total agreement with Leonard Maltin. He called it ""short on logic but long on style"". The first time I saw this film (at a drive-in!),I felt that Mr. Argento had perfected the capture of a nightmare on film. I didn't even mind the plot inconsistencies. Suspiria is haunting and so brilliantly eerie, I can't watch the videotape alone with the lights off! (Yes, the European cut is the only one to see.) Goblin's soundtrack, by the way, is their masterpiece. Hats off to Dario Argento! I've since learned that 'nightmare on film' is his forte -- but the first is still the best, in my humble opinion.",Suspiria
399,lordrob,A masterpiece of the horror genre,10,7 January 1999,"I've seen hundreds of horror films (including all of Argento's work), and *Suspiria* is my unequivocal favorite. It is not a perfect film, but it comes closer than any other film in the genre. Everything until the last few minutes is masterfully orchestrated, combining skillful direction with chilling cinematography, not to mention a score that ties my stomach into knots every time I hear so much as a snip of its odd techno-funk beat. Unfortunately, the voice of the witch at the end turns masterful horror into overriding cheese, making the tagline ring all too true: there is *nothing* more terrifying on film than the first ninety minutes, but the last few fall somewhat short of genius.That fact notwithstanding, *Suspiria* is a fine example of how horror movies should be made, and I sincerely hope that any director or screenwriter contemplating a horror film first sits down to watch this one so they can be reminded that the horror genre properly contains a good deal more than the simple-minded slasher flick that has become all-too-typical in American theaters. After all, no less a filmmaker than Wes Craven seems to have followed this advice, and it allowed him to move from such pitiful efforts as *A Nightmare on Elm Street* to *Scream*, the first (and thus far only) classic horror film of the 90's.",Suspiria
400,Pete M,Surreal Nightmare Masterpiece,10,16 March 2001,"`The only thing more terrifying than the last ten minutes of this film are the first 90'.   The tagline for Suspiria, one of the most acclaimed films of cult Italian director Dario Argento, is no idle claim, as it's one of the scariest films you are likely to see. The story, for what it's worth, deals with Suzy Bannion (the doe-eyed Jessica Harper), an American who travels to study at the celebrated Freiburg Dance Academy in Germany, only to find that something evil lurks behind it's walls.  Argento sets his film deep in the heart of Europe, the world of Dracula & Frankenstein, & he draws on old-fashioned horror tales like these for a full-on slice of Grand-Guignol mayhem.  It's Hansel & Gretel on acid. Argento & cinematographer Luciano Tovoli bathe the startlingly designed sets with a ravishing succession of deep reds & blues, creating a hallucinatory atmosphere like a twisted nightmare world.  Adding to this feel is the maniacally screaming score by Argento & rock group Goblin, with it's weird moans, load thrashes, distorted cries of `Witch!', & habit of starting & stopping suddenly. We see the hairy arms of a killer (Argento himself), but his identity is irrelevant, & Argento also uses animal attacks (including maggots, & a bat) to supreme effect. Ultimately, the fear is not of a mere slasher, but some nameless dread, a sense of all-pervading evil.  This is the closest anyone has got yet to a filmed nightmare. But what of the flaws, then.  Those wanting realism, strong plotting & strong characterisation will be disappointed, although the lack of these actually adds to the unique feel of the film.  To not let yourself be drawn into Argento's nightmare world is like laughing, an easy way out for the weak & cowardly.  It could be accused of misogyny, but Argento merely places in danger those (teenage girls, a blind man) that society traditionally tells us are more in need of protection.  He seems to be asking us more to be shocked & horrified by what happens than to enjoy their pain.  There's no identification with the killer.  The biggest flaw is the climax.  At the end of some of the most nerve-wracking suspense sequences ever filmed, the final face-off is over too quickly & is slightly unsatisfying.  However, the rest of the film is so strong, it barely matters.  Afraid?  You will be.",Suspiria
401,Neff-3,Deco/Nouveau Terror,10,6 July 1999,"To date there has not been a film so overwhelmingly beautiful in its use of both existing and specially produced deco and nouveau sets and design -- and only a genius such as Argento could properly light these edifices with the colors to trap them into the dream-like trance of a true classic, abiding, flawless horror film. There is not a moment of this film which is not dripping with artistic excellence, and yet it never lets go of the traditionally macabre, dank, seedy and vile undercurrent in most Italian horror. Susperia is like a lilly floating in putrefied blood. Without question, one of the greatest achievements in horror to date.",Suspiria

For all its visual beauty, it is very scary. The ending sequence is terrifying, in my opinion, and this is as someone who is jaded by hundreds of horror films good and bad.The film is beautiful and doesn't have a dated look to it at all.I can't believe I've gone most of my life missing this film because the cheesy posters for most of Argento's films make them look like gory hack work when that's actually true of most of the other horror films I've seen since Suspiria was made.Don't you make the same mistake as I did.

You can watch this film any time of day and you will have night(or day)mares the rest of the day(or night)!!This was the first Dario Argento movie I ever watched.  I was curious to check it out.  I did.  That music throughout the music is in my head for life(even as I write this review).  Nothing much happened to Jessica Harper after this 1977 classic.  Shame because she was a beautiful and talented actress.The first 8 minutes are creepy enough with the loud scary music.  The first murder is SOOOOOOOOO creepy.  If that scene does not scare you, shock you, or make you cringe in horror, YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!I watched this movie in the afternoon and I was scared the rest of the night.  LOLIMHO, ""The Exorcist"" is an awesome horror flick, but overrated. ""SUSPIRIA"" is the best and scariest horror movie EVER!!!  Check it out.  I have recommended it to all my friends.

406,a-trane,Psychedelic masterpiece,6,27 January 2002,"Thunder and lightning, flamboyant colors, an awesome set-design plus the strong and pounding score make this one of the finest works of Dario Argento. An overall psychedelic experience that will stay with you for the rest of your movie-life. Many claim this to be the best of his efforts, and I don't think they're necessarily wrong.Once again Dario shows that he's a pure genius in creating tension and atmosphere. This time around a girl from the U.S arrives in Germany to stay at a famous ballet-school, intentionally to improve her skills. Very soon grisly murders occur and the trails of unbound evil lead to the very gloomy, mansion-like boarding school, which may accommodate not only harmless ballet-dancers.              Many critics point out, that Dario Argento generally doesn't offer much beyond the undoubtedly visual greatness and rich atmosphere of his movies, like credible characters and a strong narration. They simply forget that his movies are all about pictures and sound, they're aesthetic statements in the first place. Everything else has to serve the main intention. I think we have enough movies out there, failing in terms of showing believable characters and catching the viewer with a complex yet coherent story, even though they're made intentionally for that purpose. Argento concentrates on what he does best - and succeeds. Highly recommended. Rating: 8/10",Suspiria
407,soplisist,A Formal and Rhythmic Masterpiece,10,4 April 2002,"This is the example of a flick with perfect form.  Its not to say that the content is perfect.  It isn't.  But there is nothing about this film formally that doesn't belong.  Everything fits together like a Seiko Wristwatch.  Music.  Action.  Editing.  What stands out is the rhythm that Argento establishes between the moments of high tension and then letting you relax and then taking you back to maximum tension. What is more, you will never be able to forget the primary color-schema that he establishes.  If you like the genre, this is the best in category!!",Suspiria
408,psychicaudio,Mixed Feelings. An incomplete meditation (Mild Spoiler...),8,6 February 2002,"With over 110 reviews of this film, I wonder who is going to read this???I skimmed through the reviews and found, not unexpectedly, that with this film most viewers either adore or despise it.  What could I possibly have to add to this glut of praise and blame? Two words with much-too-lengthy-commentary:Terrificly Ambivalent.Dario Argento is credited by some as a master and pioneer of the ""slasher"" movie genre. When I was a boy I used to draw a curious distinction between the words ""horror"" and ""terror"" in classifying films.  A horror film, to my young logic, was one which emphasized a more spiritual, psychological study in fear, more often than not a ghost story of some kind where the peril its characters undergo is often less physical than spiritual (the word ""horror"" being somewhat onomatopoeic of the rounded O of a person's mouth, moaning in extreme psychological disturbance).  A terror film, on the other hand, is the classic ""slasher,"" violent, shocking, with a focus on the sheer panic mainly of being confronted with someone or something trying to ""tear"" (alliterative sense of the word ""terror"") your body apart and the adrenaline-infused yet mainly hopeless attempt to escape.  Well, I feel that Argento's work combines the two, incidentally, and brings to the screen the best and worst of each.I have a terrible attraction/repulsion to Argento's films.  I have never been a big fan of the ""slasher"" genre as a whole.  These murder scenes-- vibrant, pulsating, writhing, lingering and terrifically brutal-- arouse in me a cold sweat of squirming moral repulsion.  I contemplate after the movie's pivotal, brilliant scene which ends famously with the desperate and actually somewhat sad (in my opinion it is simply terrifying but there is a distinct undercurrent of human despair) snuffing of the character Sarah: Why do I, why would people want to watch something that makes us feel so wretched?I can't honestly give an answer that doesn't contradict some other feeling I have on the issue.  Now typical of the slasher genre is the close-up stabbing shot.  Maybe I'm just still too squeamish to hack it, but it is awfully effective in Argento, and he just doesn't let up.  Just when you NEED relief from the violence, he gives you more, raises the bar.  These types of shots are the kinds of things only the killer would be seeing; for example a throat being slashed.  It is deeply disturbing to be put into that position.  It is the verge of psychological trauma; after the first violent scene (not the one where Sarah is killed but her unfortunately inquisitive friend Pam [?]), I was scared the rest of the movie of being made to watch it happen again to someone else.  I BECAME SCARED OF THE FILM, NOT MERELY OF WHAT IT PORTRAYED.  I believe that is the crux of why some view Argento as a master.  He is able to make you fear him, the filmaker, and he does this seemingly quite intentionally with images and sound and the interweaving of both.  It IS sublimely significant, in precisely this way, that in the first scene the killer's arm is actually Mr. Argento's arm.
Actually to me that is amazing.  Having recently seen _Suspiria_ for the second time, I now literally dread watching _Deep Red_ for the second time, though I know I will be compelled to do so.I'd love to end on that note, but I also had a brief word on so-called ""plot.""  I admit the script was mediocre as far as nuts-and-bolts dialogue goes, but I admit it only grudgingly because for me it didn't honestly detract.  But I felt that the ""plot"" in this movie is more of a theme than a plot; an instance for exploration, and yes, a bit of contemplation.  It's not interesting as a plot, not clever, not shocking or classically suspenseful, but I sense profundity nonetheless.  I'd almost have to go so far as to say this is NOT A STORY, folks, but a thematic musing.  Which goes against those who see in this film all surface, all ""effects"" (which is a fairly obvious and fallacious assumption to make about garish lighting and loud music):  There IS substantial content, regardless of the usual observation that the dialogue is cheap and the ""plot"" is thin.
A love/hate film.  Casts a spell over some viewers.  Some are immune and amused or bored by its failings.7 or so out of 10, give or take.  Could be a ten, could be a zero.  Five isn't adequate.  ;)",Suspiria
409,akg-subs,What a pathetic piece of crap!!!,2,25 April 2010,"This was my first Argento movie, and I am more than certain, the last as well. I turned off my DVD player after exactly 46 minutes of playing. Reason: my 17 year old niece just couldn't stop laughing at more than a silly storyline (was there any?) and stony expressions on actors' faces. I am sure mannequins would've done a better job at acting.Five minutes into the movie, I could tell director was going to employ sound and make-up effects to draw audiences into a fearful state. That is usually the chosen path when storyline and one's faith in self's ability is weak. Argento knew it more than anyone else. Hence the irritatingly shrill sound and coloring effects.All in all, this is a bunch of nonsensical C-grade drama with an even lower quality casting. In the age of beautiful technical work by the likes of Guillermo del Toro and Martin Scorsese, how can anyone like this crap?

410,janaka4321,too explicit,4,21 October 2003,"Very overrated movie. I watched the movie because the IMDb users had given it a good rate, but I was really dissapointed. The plot is too banal, the directing is too explicit (close-up of the stabbing scene and the scene in which a dog kills a man among many others). Blood is unnecessarily omnipresent. After all, we know that thoses effects are mere 'effects' : the colour of blood is too pale to be true; the wide-opened eyes of the murdered has nothing natural and used to shock the viewer very naively... The music, abused, is a real headache (Listen to the score of Signs (2002) to see the wonder that the music can do in a movie). Acting is poor, melodramtic, unnatural. When the characters are scared to death, the viewer wonders why... he doesn't feel anything horrible in any moment (other than a feeling of gore, disgust). The atmosphere, overworked, is nothing than a barren style. The variuosly coloured settings never really contribute to the plot.

The 2nd with another friend and we were both enthtralled by it. Every corner of the movie is pure suspense. The buildup for every scene is immense. You just don't know what's gonna happen next. I won't give away any of the scenes but the use of colour in the movie is absolutely phenomenal. I've never seen anything like it in fact. Also, if you're into gore, you'll like this one.

There is enough for the splatter-punk as well as for the viewer interested in a more traditional ghostly ""houses of the damned"" atmosphere.INFERNO, the second film in the ""Mater"" series, is highly recommended, however, for a clearer understanding of the Three Mothers concept.SUSPERIA is given a 10 for photography, an 8 for acting, a 10 for abject visceral horror, a 10 for atmosphere, a 10 for originality of storyline, and a 6 for executed plot... awarding a 9 for its entirety.As this reviewer will not be reviewing INFERNO, the viewer may want to note that the mysterious beauty in the musicology hall in Rome is the same girl who plays the ill-fated baby-sitter in Lucio Fulci's THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY. Fulci even uses the same ""seductive eye shot"" with this gorgeous actor, giving an obvious nod to our brilliant Poe-influenced director Dario Argento. Too, Fulci ""samples"" the ""bat in the hair"" scene from SUSPERIA, but makes it more gory in CEMETERY.Though SUSPERIA does not turn out to be the ""faerytale for adults"" that Argento had hoped for, it is certainly worth seeing more than once. Children and other impressionable persons should not, however, view this film. It should be added that Argento, as with many horror storytellers, banks upon the fear of death for impact. If, though, the receiver of the story has in some way conquered this fear, though the visuals still have powerful effect, the storyline itself loses much of its impact.",Suspiria
417,angeles59,"Visually beautiful, technically flawed",6,3 July 2020,"A beautiful film to watch, the photography and the change of lightening in every scene are visually satisfying, about the acting I can't say the same. Nevertheless a fun watch.",Suspiria
418,callumcity,The Greatest Horror Movie Ever Made,10,4 August 2006,"This is a pulsating beautiful nightmare. The colours bleed like blood pumping through the veins of child being told a cautionary fairy tale. The actors are like mirages in a dream. They dance like ghosts and the killers strike with ferocity. The shadows create labyrinths and space in the film and the imagination. The music expresses the intensity of nerves being jangled from a noose. Maybe this film could only have been made during the seventies. No film has ever been made like it. I prey that one will again. We'll see. This film encompasses like the threat of a recurring nightmare, then lays the experience out like an opiate, trying to catch the moment between dream and reality. Watch it alone, in the dark and with the sound pumped up.",Suspiria
419,Jessie-Anderson,Aged like fine wine!,10,25 February 2021,"Safe to say this is one of my all time favorite horror films, a classic! I understand why someone might disagree, as it lacks in some aspects, but the ambience, colors and soundtrack just make you wanna keep watching. Whenever people ask me to recommend them a movie, this is the first one I mention.P.S. I consider the remake to have it's own values, but the original is indisputably better :)",Suspiria
420,Fellani,Another brilliant nightmare from the mind of Argento,9,26 September 2001,"Like a lot of other Argento movies (Phenomena, Inferno), this movie works better if you treat it as a nightmare from start to finish. The scenario, often maligned, does hold up, but it's not really the strong point as it's secondary to the style. Like all nightmares, leave your logic at the door and prepare to assault your senses with brilliant set pieces, camerawork and pounding music by Goblin. There are a few dull moments in the middle part, but it's usually very creepy and bleak, and it's always pleasant to look at the amazing color compositions used thoughout the movie. A must see for any horror buff, and a nice introduction to Argento's work, even though I like Deep Red and Phenomena better. If you get and liked the nightmarish atmosphere of this film, Phenomena uses a similiar approach, although it's a little weird for some tastes.8/10",Suspiria
421,The_Mad_Maiden,Why is this a classic?,1,26 June 2012,"A word to the wise, don't try to figure out the plot to this movie. There isn't one. It's just a bunch of scenes loosely tied together that make no sense at all. In fact don't try to think about anything in this movie. The people who made it certainly didn't. Either that or they're following some brand of logic that I'm unfamiliar with. This movie is horrible. I have no idea how it's a ""classic"" or put on so many lists of awesome horror movies, because it's not either.Nothing makes sense in this movie. The music is alright, but soon gets annoying. My friend and I decided half the time the characters were running away from the soundtrack. Also their bodies are filled with paint.Long story short. Do not see this movie unless you want to riff it. MS3TKing it, was the only thing that kept my friend and I going during it and even then I'd have been happy to just have never seen it at all.",Suspiria
422,engagedtoprecious,One of my favorite movies of all time.,10,10 January 2012,"It's almost impossible to show this film to someone without them having some extreme type of reaction, whether negative or positive. Few films offer the audiovisual experience of ""Suspiria"" and I have played this movie in a room full of people who have never seen it and nearly everyone was stopping to inquire what exactly I was watching. Whether it's the unique use of a strong primary color palette or the music score by Goblin, something about the film draws them in like nosy people gathering at the scene of a car crash. I once had a friend come over just as the film's opening murder sequence was playing and she immediately looked at the TV with a ""What are you WATCHING?"" expression and was completely thrown.But aside from its ability to get attention, it's simply (in my opinion) a masterful piece of art. Every scene is framed and composed in such a unique way, utilizing objects and color to full effect to fill the screen with so much information. It is sad that people tend to focus on the quality of the English dubbing and ignore the film's other merits. I have seen ""Suspiria"" called cheesy and this is unfortunate because anyone with some knowledge of film technique would notice the amount of detail put into it.The film's dubbing and the bizarre use of music and color make this an acquired taste for some, which is understandable, but this shouldn't be mistaken for poor craftsmanship.From the fairy tale atmosphere to the entrancing musical score and the bold colors that just ""pop"" off the screen, ""Suspiria"" weaved a spell on me that has stuck. I have yet to experience such a unique barrage of the sense such as this and it keeps me coming back every time I'm in the mood for a different kind of horror that isn't your typical haunted house or slasher flick.",Suspiria
423,sumsaris,A Non-Thinking Man's David Lynch,5,10 February 2006,"30th Anniversary, so I thought I'd pop for a viewing. In my view, this film is a suck city production hardly worth the investment in celluloid and paper mache. An exercise in cinematic chaos that only an Italian director could get away with. Alright, to be fair, Suspiria does exude a certain flair through its use of color, lighting and soundtrack that keep it just this side of the to-be-burned trash bin. But in cinema, any cinematic genre, there are basic things that we commonly refer to as 'story' and 'editing' that are utterly missing from this kaleidoscopic jumble of images. It is as if they'd had a few grappas one night and someone got out the scissors, asked for the blindfolds and said, 'How about doing it in strips of five feet?' They could have run this film backwards and it really wouldn't have made much of a difference. Amongst the numerous WTF scenes is one where Suzy rolls a dolly into the bathroom after her phone is cut. Silver platters with a late night meal (luxury room service in a ballet school?) or trays of medicine? Who knows? She proceeds to toss half the ingredients into the toilet bowl. Superfluous close-ups that show little more than a napkin (sanitary?) and then she flushes. Next, a glass of some red substance is poured into the sink. Poisoned tomato juice, blood? It looks like paint. Why didn't she just flush it down the toilet as well like you and I would? So that she could proceed to scrub away at the now red-stained sink. Close-up again. The substance doesn't rinse away and now her hands are 'soiled'. This matter-of-fact exposition should end with a moment of drama where Suzy reacts with either frustration, anger, tears or at least curiosity. Instead Suzy saunters off nonchalantly to open a window which allows her to be duly attacked by the fat pigeon bat instead. By the way, was it only my copy, or is the sound of her whacking away at the beast timed to the upbeat when the whacking chair is above her head. Talk about sound synch!As for the horrific stilted dialogue, it reminded me of something between the narration of a Soviet travelogue and a Cliff notes-based high school play translated into English from...English by the Buenos Aires marching choir. Everyone in this movie speaks as if they had just graduated from a U.N. interpreter's institute. Flat, grammatically correct yet lacking emotional inflection. No soul, no umphh. In fact this film was probably dubbed into multiple languages using the same language school people. Bargain! The textbook dialogue peaks in the scene where the Rosa Klebb-ish ballet instructor throws Jose Feliciano the piano player out of the institute with a parting...""Good Riddance"". Straight out of a 1930s comedy.Family affair that this film was, Suspiria might have been tag-titled Dario vs The Argentos for the gap between a vision and its execution. It's a shame considering the money and effort that went into the Art Nouveau sets and other production values. Perhaps, this multimedia maze of a movie would better have been released as a simple slide-show with the random-sequence option permanently enabled. As it stands it's best suited for MST3K material. The Beast from Yucca Flats--now there's a movie that takes dubbing to new heights!",Suspiria
424,r_pettersson,Nightmarish masterpiece,9,31 October 2012,"This really is a masterpiece. I realize more and more after each time I see it how Argento is giving us clues about what will happen before it actually happens and when the music is getting louder and louder then you know that something will happen but you don't know what and get prepared for something gory but at the same time beautiful. The music is one reason why this movie is so disturbing, but it fits so well with what happens.So the whole movie really is like a disturbing nightmare that you never wake up from. The architecture and environment is fantastic with all red colors that somehow makes me think of blood. Even that the blood has that unnatural red color makes it so nightmarish. Actually it isn't an interesting story and it's quite short also but that doesn't matter much. Jessica Harper is really good in this movie, but there are some actors that I don't think are so good in it.I like how it starts at the airport with the music and the storm. Something happens already in the beginning and it's never boring because you know that something can happen anytime, like a dog suddenly bite his owner by no reason.I give this movie 10/10 because I really think this is a beautiful movie, it is definitely worth watching.",Suspiria

426,matthewacollier,"Beautiful Movie, Undercooked Story",7,9 September 2017,"78Viewed 4K Theatrical ScreeningMy main problem with this film is the story, which I feel is inconclusive, even for a ""dreamlike"" movie. David Lynch does a much better job at fully providing catharsis for his dreamlike films, Terrence Malick also isn't half bad with ending his films, which have a very free-floating way of approaching narrative, and even Hard to Be a God, a film I wouldn't necessarily say is good, has a better way of ending than this film. I'm a fan of the Coens, but even I can recognize they aren't all that great at ending their movies, opting for a sharp cut to credits. Well, this movie doesn't even have THAT, opting to just let the credits roll over the final shot. Also, the story is really not that interesting besides that ending. I didn't really care what was happening because I guessed what the narrative was going to do in the beginning. And you know what? I guessed correctly, removing the majority of mystery from the film. ALSO also, I wasn't that enamored with the lighting/cinematography. I mean, it's beautiful, but beautiful visuals and an amazing soundtrack does not a masterpiece make. ALSO ALSO also, I don't think I came at this wrong. I just wanted a really colorful, well paced ""horror"" film, but I got a really colorful, so- so paced ""horror"" film. I'm willing to get down with a dreamlike movie, but this film is far too caught up in certain things that just didn't grab my attention. I was paying attention, but more so to the scattershot dubbing than the actual information. It's really good... but it's no quintessential picture.",Suspiria
427,Lily_ot_Valley,not worth watching,1,31 January 2016,"I wanted to see this movie because I love ballet. The summary sounded interesting so I thought I'd give it a chance, even though it's horror and from the 70ties (both bad signs).Well I've rarely seen ballet been portrayed so poorly. Really this is not how a dance school works even if it is run by witches. Where do I start? Why does this girl even want to study there? It's inconceivable that you don't bring your own shoes to class. Why does she receive a costume but everyone in class is wearing a different outfit? No one ties their hair for class? The dancing is terrible and pointless. Everyone is doing their own exercise at the same time? In short: it's not worth your time if you are interested in dance movies. Otherwise the plot is illogical but predictable at the same time. The interesting scenes are not worked out, the boring scenes just take forever. The acting is poor, the scary scenes aren't scary and the gory scenes are only funny because of the poor special effects. The music is really loud and jarring. The theme music just plays over and over. In contrast the dialogue is on a much lower volume so you can hardly understand what they're saying - oh yeah also because of the fake German accents. I read here this is a classic. I did notice the scenes all lighted with different bright colours, I suppose it comes across as very artistic. It is also very obvious and makes the movie even more dated than it already is. So, in short, you could give this movie a chance but I predict you will feel cheated of 98 minutes of your life.",Suspiria
428,andja-80337,A Technicolor Fairytale Nightmare,8,8 December 2018,"This movie is crazy good. The filming is beautiful, the colors are stupendous and the plot is well done. The characters are flat and undeveloped and it's not really scary (because it's a foarytale) but I still loved it",Suspiria
429,SpookiusMortem,Nearly Perfect,7,15 November 2002,"This creepy thriller is undoubtedly one of the better horror films to come out of the '70s. Argento found the perfect heroine in Jessica Harper, who plays the role of an emotionally detached American at a German ballet school. The emotional detachment that she portrays in her character adds significantly to the mood of the film. Argento also uses color for setting mood brilliantly, much in the same style as Kubrik, though not with quite with the subtleness as Kubrik used color in his films. The acting of the rest of the cast is satisfactory at best, with the exception of the first two victims who shouldn't have been given any dialogue in the film. 3/5 stars for low grade acting and poor special effects. But mood, atmosphere, and suspense, the foundations of any good horror, get a solid 5/5 stars.",Suspiria
430,klugscheisser23,"Suspiria, how I do love thee...",10,27 September 2000,"Suspiria, a truly incredible example of the horror genre, is most often overlooked by horror fans. This film is Dario Argento at his most creative, using more than just ""jump-scare"" tactics. The use of ambient lighting and shadows remind me of old German expressionist film techniques, which although limited to black and white, were still able to convey the full emotion of the scene. Here, visual effects are presented in blindingly bright colour and thick black shadow. In fact, the art direction is perhaps the most striking aspect of the film, making use of painfully imposing actual buildings in the German locale and gaudily decorated ""modern-70s""-style sets. The use of extreme set-to-actor ratios, ranging from tiny, suffocating rooms to expansive indoor-and-outdoor locations, the viewer manages to feel a constant claustrophobia. The music and sound, quite piercing and discomforting, adds to the armrest-gripping mood of the film. There are a few problems, however, such as the fact that most of the actors do not speak English and are poorly dubbed. This sometimes slows down the progress of the film, as do the sometimes lengthy plot expositions provided at different points in the film. If you look at this film from a camp standpoint, some dialogue is downright hilarious, worthy of MST3K-style ripping. I do agree with lordrob in reference to the end, as the last act is almost a let down after such a strong buildup. I really have to say that Suspiria is one of my all-time favourite films. Having originally seen it on the small screen, I recently had the pleasure of seeing it again at the local English rep. cinema. Of course, the experience was quite different, and of course, this time, I was watching it in a packed theatre. (There were many more people laughing their heads off.) However, if you can, get a group of friends together and catch it if it comes to town. Or, if you can find it on video, turn off the lights and turn up the sound on the TV. Either way, you'll enjoy this Argento horror masterpiece.",Suspiria
431,counsel1,Pretentious,2,5 February 2001,"This movie epitomizes the subjugation of plot to art.  Beautifully shot, it makes no sense whatsoever.

Each attempt at horror lapses quickly into confusion or unintended comedy.",Suspiria
432,cindylchick,The music ruined it for me,2,25 October 2021,I love a good vintage horror and I can see this had the bones of something I would ordinarily like but the music and sounds in general just made this irritating rather than creepy and suspenseful. The music just seemed really jarring and annoying. Repetitive loud noises had me turning the volume right down then missing the dialogue as it was too quiet. I found the soundtrack didn't seem to fit what was happening on screen most of time which made the film harder to follow than it should have.,Suspiria
433,johaneksmyr,Breathtaking cinematographic scenes,9,5 August 2021,"Amazing lightning and filming. The whole film so full of cinematographic sceneries, just that makes Susperia well worth seeing. So many times I just enjoyed the shooting angle and the colourful lightning.Exquisite building style and interior. Everything is designed so classy and beautiful that it is pure enjoyment to watch.The main acting characters are all acting very well, though the dialogues are a weakness.As I understand, the idea was to have children not older than twelve playing the dancers. Now, when the actors are older, the dialogues sometimes becomes childish, but overall it works anyway.The plot is simple, a bit artificially constructed. This is a small weakness. A few scenes disappoint from that perspective. Also a few interactions seems artificial and not so great.The soundtrack is also a great contribution, making the film what it is. It is so disturbing in it's repeated simple sequences, that it gets under my skin.An excellent horror movie, but not only that, it is a piece of filmic art. So many beautiful scenes makes me enjoyably smile many times despite being in the midsts of the horror.With kids playing in this film it would certainly have been banned, but that would and that would have made this film so disturbingly creepy, that nightmares would have being a given. What comes to mind in comparison is The Exorcist from the same time period. A film with much better dialogue and, a child playing the main role.Overall, just for the filming and the sceneries, this is a 10/10 movie, but I give it a 9, but it could have been a strong 8.

I heard that it was Dario Argento's ""masterpiece"". I figured I would give it a shot since I hadn't seen anything by Argento ever. After watching it, I am shocked that anyone could give it anything higher than a 5/10.To me, a good movie combines several elements: good camera-work, good acting and, of course, a good plot. Good camera-work...check. Good acting...maybe for a horror movie.Plot? I won't give anything away (although there really isn't much to give away on this one)...but the plot in this movie is simply nonexistent. Doesn't plot matter when reviewing a movie?

This movie, truly delivers in that it's overall atmosphere is Dark, Creepy, and leaves you wondering what's going to happen next. The story is very well written, and the characters are believable in their various roles. This movie, is more for the Horror fan not seeking tons of Gore, but for the Horror fan looking to be spooked on a Psychological realm. The movie easily, with it's atmosphere, music, and overall ""dark"" imagery can easily send even the most ""brave"" and or ""tough"" Horror fan to have a slight tingle down their spine.

437,aidan_phantom,A film that will awaken your senses.,10,22 August 2010,"This movie resides in a little genre I like to call Horror Conspiracy where the lead character uncovers mysteries and then tries to solve them and everyone close to him/her disbelieves the theorising that is occurring: the rule of thumb is that the mystery is usually something to do with Aliens or the Occult, this movie deals with the latter, more specifically the film deals with witches. When you mix with formula with Dario Argento you get a strange blend of surrealist atmosphere, extreme violence and a chilling and memorable score. Suspiria lives outside of reality that is the best way to describe this, logic and physics are suspended here and if you are the type of person who can't end handle the surrealist nature of Alice in Wonderland you stand no chance here.The movie follows a newcomer Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) to a higher class ballet academy and she discovers that the staff are a coven of witches that are hell-bent on chaos and destruction. The plot is silly at best but this is a film where the plot does not matter it there just to give the film so feel of structure.I don't where to begin with this movie, it is so insanely fantastically extraordinary that it deserves to be celebrated by all, horror fans and cinephiles alike.I shall start with the atmosphere because it is integral to the movie it is unrelentingly creepy and eerie, in my books it beats every single J- Horror hands down which is an honour because I have always said the atmosphere in a J-Horror could beat any movie from the USA and Europe, it looks like I am eating my words now because here we have terror in its purest form. The next integral part of this movie is the use of colour and not just any colour deep primary colours, to portray the tone. This is nothing short of amazing and I don't use that word lightly, on first viewing the colour just becomes a part of the movie but it works on an innate and subconscious level, our innate subconscious is readily aware that the colour red is danger, this is a device that I wish was used more in modern cinema and when I say used I mean used in the correct way to achieve what Argento has here and not only does the colour add to the atmosphere it adds to the bizarre and hallucinogenic feeling the movie seems to have. The cinematography works to the movie's advantage and makes a perfect partnership between the colour and it. Even the main theme is so incredibly beautiful on so many levels it manages to capture the mood of the movie and is so memorable and fantastic and it does far surpass any other horror film theme and that is probably due to it's avant garde nature the incomprehensible shouting and moaning just adds to Argento's irrational vision.Of course the film has a few winks and nudges to other classics but that is because unlike most others the film has succeeded in what it set out to do scare but not only scare it has become a work out art and therefore deserves to reference classics because it is in that league. It references Psycho, Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead and The Exorcist and why shouldn't it have fun doing so but to be honest these might be best left until the second viewing because on the first viewing you will be so stunned with the set design and cinematography and colour you will not have enough time to spot them, your senses will be so stunned by the end of the film that you really won't know what hit you.Naturally there are two things that Argento will get stick for here: one being graphic violence towards women. Argento has been accused many time for being sexist but he is adamant he is not ""A woman in peril is emotionally affecting. A man simply isn't"". It's hard to disagree with his logic here and anywhere in horror cinema so here' s quick note for those who accuse him of such things, do your damn research before casting stones! The other thing people might have a hard time accepting is the use of extremely graphic violence itself but, it is not gratuitous it has a purpose it is to exploit the use of the colour. The colour of blood is another fundamental feature of this movie without it I am highly doubtful that it would have worked without it especially considering the most abundant colour in this film is a garish red. Surely this is a perfect movie because there is not one single feature you could tweak to make it better in any way and if you could do let me know I would be very intrigued.Skip to the End10/10The film is mesmerising, entrancing, terrifying and it has the most spectacular display of everything I have ever seen in a film. You won't easily forget it. This is a masterpiece that will never be forgotten and if you haven't seen it think Rosemary's Baby with an immense infusion of acid and then ask yourself if you can handle that first.",Suspiria

This is my favorite Argento movie,i think he is the Italian Carpenter (Carpenter took a lot of things from the Argento's Profondo Rosso - Deep Red) From the first scene when Susy appears in the airport the atmosphere is unique,the script is very original and the soundtrack,the soundtrack is a ""plus"" to make this film a classic of the genre.The final scene when Susy understands everything that happening in the school and she discovers what is the director of the school,i mean that scene is just great,the tension that Argento creates is fantastic.And of course the last scene,the fight of Susy with the Witch is one of the greatest horror scenes.

440,dataclast,Hmmm,9,16 February 2005,"Alright. I have read the bad reviews that people have given this film. I can completely understand why they have been written, and I respect the opinions of those that have them.Before I go on to explain why I love this movie so much I'll have to talk a little bit about its shortcomings.The major thing that should be faulted is the acting. Perhaps it is just the dubbing, but the acting is quite lousy. Jessica Harper, and some of the older actresses, suit their roles very well yet for the most part the acting verges on being laughable. As well, the pace should be somewhat faulted as there are a great deal of moments that could have been cut out to make it a better movie.When I truly think for myself about this film these are the only problems that I can think of. Certainly these are problems that must be mentioned, yet there is so much that I love in this film. For one, I actually quite enjoy the plot of it. It is simple, yet built up in a way that is exciting and sensible (to some degree). The score is terrifying, though quite repetitive. It is quite an intense piece of music that that band Goblin wrapped together, I must say.As for why this is perhaps my favorite horror movie of all time, save maybe Dawn of the Dead or The Shining, let me rave for a while. This film is like an extremely violent acid trip. The color is completely out of this world, making you feel as though you are part of something truly supernatural or alien. As well, the 'story behind the story' is really really cool and I found it to be somewhat creepy. There are certain scenes, even non violent ones, that just freak me out. Like the scene where Suzy is in the dancing room amidst some horrible sickness. It honestly seems as though she is being literally forced to dance by some strange power in the school.I don't even need to say that this film is atmospheric because that is something that is just known by all horror fans. What I need to say is that it really is quite terrifying. Despite the lack of emotional depth the film remains an emotional experience for me. Maybe I'm just a wacko, but I really really get into this film when I watch it. It is the most violent and elegant piece of horror that I have ever seen in my entire life. There are certain images in this movie that completely haunt me. And yes, the last 12 minutes of Suspiria are completely horrifying.I think perhaps the reason that I love this film so much was that it is the film that made me fall head over heals for horror. I had always been a fan of horror to some degree, but when I saw this it turned into more of a full on fascination. It sometimes leaves me with sleeping troubles to see this movie. See it, and if you don't like it, than discuss that. I can totally see why people both love AND hate this film. In truth, when considering depth of character or social commentary or whatnot, the film does not seem to have so much substance. But when you get beyond this and see it as some sort of a weird nightmarish supernatural world then the style in a way becomes the substance and you just have to let yourself get taken away by it. Sure the plot can be slow and certain moments perhaps would have been better left out, but it is actually something of an engaging story as well. The ending is pure genius, not only because it has the power to scare the living dead out of me, but because it comes together so well. It is perhaps the most powerful ending that I have ever seen in a horror movie, save perhaps the ending of The Exorcist (which is powerful in a different way).So, if Suspiria is not your kind of thing but you still want to give horror a chance I would recommend something like The Exorcist or maybe some of those old Roger Gorman Poe adaptations. But it is always a good idea to keep an open mind to these things. If you accept it for what it is you could just end up having the ride of your life.(By the way, Helena Markos scares the daylights out of me)",Suspiria
441,Slobberman,Nothing short of ear- and eye-candy,9,10 November 2018,"Suspiria is film as a form of visual art at its absolute best. Almost every single shot is hauntingly beautiful, with its vibrant colors just jumping out of the screen. Combine that with one of the best horror soundtracks I have ever heard, and you've got the ingredients for an incredibly atmospheric horror movie. The cinematography together with the soundtrack make for some scary and suspenseful moments. I also liked that the film did not shy away from being brutally violent.The movie is not perfect though. Plot-wise there isn't a lot going on, but for me the visuals and the sound were so strong that the thin plot did not drag the film down. The acting can be silly at times. Joan Bennett and Alida Valli however were very convincing. Also the practical effects are a bit outdated, so if that's something you have a problem with then be advised. Lastly, I wasn't a big fan of some of the exposition, as it felt out of place almost.In conclusion, if you are someone who prefers movies with a strong plot and characters, look somewhere else. But if you don't mind a movie that focuses heavily on visuals, sound and suspense, then this is a must watch.",Suspiria

443,ecp7039,Does this movie have a plot?,10,13 September 2005,"Suspiria is an awesome piece of art, much like the Abominable Dr. Phibes or any Disney cartoon (seriously). It should be played at a museum, not late night on AMC. It's probably one of the most beautiful movies I've seen. The colors can just draw you in. And the images -- a woman swimming through barbed wire, glass shattering, and other scary Italian things -- are sensational. The music is also recommended. Unlike the soundtrack to Demons and Demons 2, which were filled with 80s songs that Italians must have assumed Americans like, this movie uses its music to build the suspense. I sincerely recommend this movie, not for the dopey, nonsensical plot, and not from the scares (because it's not a particularly scary movie), but for the artistic value. That alone makes it a masterpiece.",Suspiria
444,mihgeorg,Pure horror,10,7 November 2006,"Although it has aged quite a bit, this movie is a blueprint to make a horror movie. From the tense buildup to the savage first murder, then the eerie atmosphere to the climatic ending. Tecnicaly the movie is superb, with great camera work, lighting and music. The tension builds superbly and the murder scenes, though few are exquisitely made. True, seeing it now there are some flaws, like the not perfect acting or the really old special effects, but the strengths of the movie truly outweigh them. One of the best elements of the movie is that, in my opinion,is that is is not judgemental as many other genre movies, just a logical (in it's own logic) progression of a simple story. Everybody dies for a single reason and actually makes sense, while the movie does not try to press a point, just shows the events. A must see.",Suspiria
445,gothcoffee,Hard to watch,2,8 November 2018,"I watched this movie with excitement ahead of the highly anticipated remake that is currently in theaters. The remake is being highly praised as one of the best horror films of 2018 and so, being a horror fan I decided I should watch the original first.How I wish I hadn't. The most blatant problem in this film for me was the audio. The dialogue is really quiet, half the time it's actually whispers. But then the sound effects and music kick in and my ears start to bleed because it's so loud. I should've just put subtitles on and muted it. The main theme is quite good but when there is only one song on the soundtrack that plays throughout the entirety of the film, you start to get sick of it.My next issue is the dialogue itself. Very poor writing, and to go onto my next point, it's also poorly executed. The acting in this film is absolutely atrocious, I agree with others who say the acting is on par with a bad porno.The only thing this film has going for it would be the color palette/aesthetic. But even then the blatant use of red and green was really distracting me from trying to wrap my head around the storyline. The story seemed to not follow any sort of plot at all, and by the time they reveal what's going on I had lost all interest and was force feeding the rest of the movie to myself.I wanted to like this film, I really did. As a horror junkie, I could care less about the cheesy special effects, there are tons of old films that transcend the limitations of their technology. This unfortunately is not one of those films. If you are reading reviews before watching, please save yourself some time and watch something else.",Suspiria
446,precotisammy,Argento is a master of atmosphere,9,19 May 2019,"He manages to give Suspiria the qualities of both a supernatural threat and a slasher film. It's really quite hard to classify just what kind of horror film it is. It's also a bit hard to decipher what it all means. However, even at just face value it's an excellent movie. I did find myself once or twice drifting to my phone during some slow moments, but I always found my attention quickly restored as the unexplainable began to happen once again. It's an original and entrancing experience. A legendary standout in the genre for good reason. Not to be missed.",Suspiria
447,samansais,Suspiria is a stunning visual and musical experience,7,18 August 2020,"Suspiria is a stunning visual and musical experience.The entire film is caked in this vibrant neon color that accents the amazing set design. Very unconventional color choices are used throughout its entirety, even down to the costuming. There is a sense of unpredictability that comes with the choices, which adds to the mysticism of the film. These pretty colors also add contrast to the ugliness of the horrific moments in the film, making them feel much more abrasive.Progressive rock band Goblin does a great job on this soundtrack, further adding a distinct sense of mysticism to the film. It shares similarities to some of John William's moments in the Harry Potter soundtrack, while of course offering a more thrilling side to cinematic composition. At times I felt the soundtrack was the element driving the horror, with the cinematography playing the role of the visual vehicle for the suspense.The one hangup I had with the film is that although it had a lot to show, and a lot to listen to, it didn't have a lot to say. The narrative is very loosely strung together with acting performances that left more to be desired. I didn't feel much for any of the characters besides the lead act. The strange attempt at having a romantic interest was really awkward and they didn't do much with that either.Luckily by the climax of the film things start to come together nicely and we are left on a high note. Suspiria is a piece of art, but best appreciated when ignoring its failings.",Suspiria
448,YeahResident,Suspiria is way overrated. Argento's own Opera is much better.,7,30 December 2001,"Suspiria sucks.Opera, The Beyond, The Evil Dead movies, the Hellraiser movies, The Exorcist, The Shining, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Zombie, Dawn of The Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Return of the Living Dead. All of these movies are much better horror movies. Almost all horror movies are better.
In my opinion, this movie did have some funny parts. But no scary parts. No suspense. The music was ok, and there were three funny parts, but that's about it. Where to? ""Essenstrassa"" ""What?"" ""Essenstrassa"" ""What?"" That was funny. It reminds me of Steve Austin in the WWF. Then when that funny, blind guy on the piano goes ""Stop It! Stop It You Stupid Bitch!"" I was cracking up. It reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger in Kindergarden Cop. The third funny part of the movie comes when two girls are going ""Sssssss, sssss"" to each other like snakes.In my opinion, this is not Argento's best work. If you want to see a really good Argento movie get Opera or rent Tenebre or Inferno.They seem better as well.The acting in Suspiria cannot come close to that of Opera. Especially cool in Opera is where the killer shoots the lady through the peephole on the door as she's looking through.Unless you want to see a boring horror movie about a ballet dancer that has a few funny parts to it. I suggest you see one of the aforementioned movies I listed at the beginning of this summary and skip this overrated snoozefest.",Suspiria
449,The-Flick_Chick,Beautiful and horrifying,10,17 June 2013,"This is absolutely in my top two of favorite films. I love everything about it. The sound is impeccable, the set is beautiful. The acting is perfect. There is nothing about this film that I would change.Argento is a horror master, and this is the crown jewel of his collection. The story takes place in a prestigious European ballet school. Suzy is the latest arrival to the school, upon arriving she notices strange and frightening things are happening. She shortly discovers a coven of witches within the school. The set was inspired by Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' and you can tell. The beautiful architecture and design of the sets is awe inspiring. If you haven't treated yourself to an Argento film yet I suggest starting with this one, you won't regret it.",Suspiria
450,iris_321,A vivid classic of European horror.,9,23 May 2010,"The Italian maverick directs a gruesome story (the first film in the never-completed 'Three Mothers' trilogy) about an American dancer Susy Banyon (Harper) who travels to Europe to enrol at a famous ballet school. Settling in at the academy proves increasingly difficult, as she is greeted with bizarre noises and even stranger occurrences, eventually realising that the establishment is a facade concealing a dark world of sinister witchcraft, in which throat slashings are commonplace.Hailed as a European horror classic, Suspiria's bloody charm resides in its technical triumphs and visual style. Argento's skillful use of unsettling, intense colour and stunning set designs adequately obscure the film's numerous structural flaws. Death is portrayed with aesthetic abandon - most memorable is the scene where one woman in a negligee escapes a predator by crawling through a window, only to tumble onto a mat of razor wire. Argento's confident conjuring of hallucinatory terror and all-pervading evil sends a spell-binding chill through every frame. The bloody mark of a fine horror picture.",Suspiria
451,cp42,A favorite,10,6 August 2003,"Let's look at how a standard horror movie works: you build up characters that the audience identifies with (maybe some teenagers, or a family with a cute kid) for the first part of the movie, which is usually pretty sunny. Then the monster drops in and terrorizes our victims; they get chased and we get 'scared'.  Various happenings in the plot where things we didn't know before get revealed try to keep up interested.  And so it goes.  I think Stephen King's got a how-to book that explains how to do all this stuff, if you're interested...Suspiria, if you haven't seen the movie or heard anything about it, doesn't exactly work like that, or even try to.  'Atmosphere' is not even the right word- it's more like a shared hallucination.  The plot is criticized even by the movie's supporters; personally, I think it might have done the movie service if all explanations had been done away with altogether (then you'd _really_ read some howling reviews from people who ""wasted their money""). I wouldn't exactly call it scary, but I don't know that I've ever really been literally scared by any movie since I was about ten or so.  I will say it's an unmatched experience, and one of the few horror movies that I return to again and again.  It's a rare breed of movie, and in its breed, it's really the best we've got.So, to wrap up, I won't exactly pass on a recommendation to the reader. If you're the kind of person that needs to see this movie, you'll probably end up seeing it, but if you want a safe bet for a rental or purchase, try a safer movie.  People seem to like the Sixth Sense; try that one.  But suffice it to know that if this movie works for you, it'll really work: check out the number of tens it's getting (one of them's mine!), compared to the backlash from people upset about a movie that really just wasn't for them.  Oh well: every movie can't be for every person.  Fans can be smug in their appreciation of a one-of-a-kind movie, though.",Suspiria
452,LMoog,"Decent, but not special",5,3 January 2019,"Classic or not, Suspiria leaves a lot to be desired.Of course, it has great visuals: the entire film takes place in oppressively colorful rooms and hallways that evoke surreal, dream-like feelings; and yes, it's musical score is nothing short of amazing: the main theme, in particular, must be one of the most ominous pieces I've ever heard. In fact, I liked it so much that I wasn't even bothered by the fact that it is played every 10 minutes throughout the film.However, while Suspiria abounds in style, it most definitely lacks in substance. The acting is uninspired and the plot so simple that you almost forget there is one. It is an exercise in aesthetics - and worth watching if that is something that interests you - but if not, all you'll be left with is 70's gore and poorly dubbed dialogue.",Suspiria
453,halloweenbikini,A beautiful horror,9,27 April 2004,"It takes a strong stomach to watch Dario Argento films. If you are particularly squeamish, then skip his other films and watch this one. It is gruesome, yes, the violence starts very early on, but worth it for it is the most stunning looking horror film. It is an art nouveau nightmare masterpiece. It is obvious that the main focus for Argento was the look of the film. It is saturated in colour, there is much stained glass, opulent early 20th century decor, in fact even the walls are painted with beautiful art nouveau friezes and the set dressed better than the actors.While the setting is glorious, the story does not suffer for lack of attention. Argento does not like to give much away in terms of plot or exposition, he paces it rather slowly and leaves the audience hanging for the next clue to the mystery. The basic plot is as follows: a young American girl, arrives in Germany to study ballet and dance at a rather sinister academy. Horrible things occur and she is drawn into the goings on.This is the first of a trilogy of movies, the third still yet to see the light of day. Inferno was the second of the trilogy, but I found this to be the superior movie. Let's hope the third is worth the wait, it has been 24 years since the last installment. Even if you don't view Suspiria as the first of a trilogy, it is a film that easily stands alone.
Argento's Giallo films (the precursor to the slasher genre) are very confronting in their depictions of violent death. It is truly gruesome, but beautiful at the same time. Argento's talent is in framing the violence, the pacing of it, the underscoring of it. Take for example the first sequence of violence in the film: it is set in a large art nouveau apartment building, framed along darkness, with only lurid red light illuminating the proceedings, until it finishes on a stained glass dome. The violence is depicted in close up, the only wide shots being the interior of this beautiful apartment building. Only when the carnage is over does the camera pan out from the victim to reveal the aftermath of the carnage. The music score is very percussive and frantic, with screams and strange vocal noises every present. It is unnerving, as is the opening Suspiria theme. Listening to the soundtrack (by Italian prog rock band Goblin and Dario Argento) by itself, with no visuals is enough to scare you witless. This is nightmare layered on nightmare. Every cinematic element is designed to scare you and it does.If you are going to watch this film, track down a copy that has not been hacked to pieces by the 70's censors. This shouldn't be too hard anymore, the recent DVD releases of his films promise that they are the uncut original versions as Argento intended. Argento has always had troubles with censors around the world, and it is wonderful that they are finally getting a viewing in their entirety, proper pacing and all. If you are a horror fan and have not seen this film, I guarantee you will develop a real appreciation for the Giallo genre. If you are not a horror fan, watch it anyway as it is masterful visual film making. Either way just see it, it's worth it.9/10",Suspiria
454,hoodnick,A nightmarish fairytale with an appreciation for violence,7,10 September 2012,"With its reputation as one of the most atmospheric and stylistic entries within the horror genre, one might build up grand expectations of excellent acting, dialog, cinematography and narration. Suspiria, on the other hand is a movie so original and bizarre that it defies all anticipations, for better or for worse. You can tell right from the beginning that Dario Argento tried really hard to achieve something unique with the interesting setting of a prestigious ballet school in Germany as his foundation. Here we get to follow aspiring dancer Suzy Bannion who stumbles into a nightmarish panorama of frightening colors and strange phenomena when she comes to the conclusion that the female employees are in fact witches; evil sorcerers who create misfortune for nothing else than their sadistic needs. As far as the storyline goes, Suspiria fares rather well, relying on its originality rather than any kind of complexity. Witches are rare antagonists even in the horror genre, so any culprits other than unnaturally strong human beings, zombies and vampires provide a refreshing breeze that disobeys the norm. Characterization is another important criteria but I fear that the nature of the movie itself is far too bizarrely different for a proper assessment; in short, none of the characters are ever able to leave their one-dimensional realms even for the shortest of moments, but nor do they actually need to. Suzy, the protagonist herself, is incredibly hard to describe without using the word ""bland"", but then again that was probably the only point of her character; a mundane girl with stereotypically female interests thrown into a bloodstained fairy tale of frightening proportions. Likewise, most of the other characters only embody one or arguably a few characteristics that don't really make for any deeper explorations.The writing suffers from slightly more troublesome problems; Dario originally intended the story to star young children of around 12. When the idea was rejected and the ages of the characters were raised, he didn't make any adjustments to the script. In other words, what we get are young adults who behave like they're still in their pre-teens. While we're on the subject I might also add that most of the dialog was not recorded whilst shooting with creates a certain delay that's highly noticeable and equally annoying; not to mention that it makes the already mediocre actors come off as severely worse.With all this said, are there any redeeming qualities to find in this movie? Sure there are. You can explain it in very accurate manners to almost anyone and they won't fall for it. Suspiria is incredibly hard to sell since it basically boils down into a visual and auditory experience where the primary importance lies in what you can see and the music you hear. As far as cinematography goes, an eerie atmosphere of strong colors and creepy shadows is achieved with limited effort but almost limitless effect. Enhanced by the insanely freaky and above all else bizarre soundtrack that emphasizes strange noises more than any melodies, the result is nightmarish. The viewer feels like he stumbled right into a fairy tale or dream-scape so mesmerizing and occasionally pretty that he finds it a lot easier to ignore logical inconsistencies (of which there are plenty) and scenes that suffer from poor execution.A lot has been said about this movie. It's been called a masterpiece, overrated trash and hauntingly creepy art. In the end, it requires you to forgive several flaws that are well worth forgiving with the insanely original and atmospheric viewing it provides. Whether or not you end up enjoying it might even be a question of minor irrelevance; it's going to be an interesting watch regardless of your personal opinion.",Suspiria
455,Tangstad,Beautiful and nigthmarish at the same time,10,26 February 2005,"Suspiria is one of those movies that keep on coming back to your mind again and again and again. Dario Argento uses violence, cinematography and colors to create the nightmarish atmosphere. The use of red creates an illusion of blood running down the walls. Argento is known for using the camera in a superb way, and Suspiria is no worse than other Argento movies. The camera is almost a character himself, it goes up and down walls, through windows etc. There are three things that creates atmosphere here: Goblins excellent score, the colors and the superb use of camera. Suspiria contains an excellent creepy feel all through the movie, and is my absolute favorite. I've got nothing more to say than: Perfect, just perfect.",Suspiria

It's so gruesome and the music can be hilarious but Suspiria's kinda gets stuck in your head. You can't deny liking it.The most memorable scene in the movie is when the gets brutally stabbed and then hung from the glass in the ceiling causing another of a young woman. A sheet of glass falls on her, how unfortunate.First of all I have to say, I love ballet, I was in a dance company, so the fact that they tied ballet and horror together makes me all warm inside. Jessica Harper is an awe-inspiring actress. She was seen in Phantom of the Paradise which is another good one. I was hoping she knew how to dance but NOPE!

457,aaandykov-994-800452,More Argento Gore,5,19 September 2014,"Let's get one thing straight right from the start. This is a horror film and, like most horror films, the story is absolute tosh. The story line is, at least now 35 odd years after release, as old as the hills. Creepy going ons in a school-in this case a dance school. The location shoots are reasonable, especially the city square in Munich where (spoiler alert) the guide dog gets over excited. If you like Leder Hosen, then wait for the hilarious beer hall shenanigans! The dance school itself is a fine set, lit like a bordello with a Nazi like Alida Valli (no less) putting the dancers through their paces. The music is typical thumping 1970's Italian horror-thumping rock interspersed with tinkling percussion and assorted grunts and whispers. Most of the acting is execrable, although the version I saw was dubbed so maybe an unfair comment. The main characters are beastly, stupid, or beastly and stupid. What the police are doing amongst all the gory deaths and unsolved disappearances, I have no idea. Some claim this is a horror masterpiece. No it's not. Just another Argento rock and roll with some bloody set pieces.",Suspiria
458,vipers222,Suspiria,6,12 March 2008,"I finally got around to seeing the cult classic Suspiria and I would say I have mixed feeling about it. There were some genuinely scary moments. The music was creepy and the lighting gave a sinister look to the academy. But some of the special effects are definitely dated and some are even comical. Also I am not a big fan of substituting gore for truly scary moments which Suspiria seems to do at times. The ending came off fairly abrupt and somewhat anticlimactic. Perhaps my expectations were too high going into viewing the movie. Also I watched a dubbed version which made it difficult at times to follow the dialog. I tried to compare Suspira it with other movies around the same time period (1977). Suspiria makes a decent showing and I gave it a 6 out of 10. But I suspect younger horror fans that were raised on slasher movies, CGI, and short attention spans might not be able to get into the movie.",Suspiria
459,konnes,a disappointment,4,11 December 2007,"I watched this movie because one of my friends told me it was among his favourite five horror movies. I have to say I was very disappointed: The acting - most importantly the acting of the protagonist - was shockingly bad. The plot - as far as it even existed - made no sense and the dialogues were very weak, therefore there was no suspense whatsoever.I can understand what people like about this movie. It is praised for its inventive use of colours and music to create an intense atmosphere. I admit that this is true although the director overdoes it. But this is simply not enough to make a horror movie.If you compare this movie to the likes of Dance of the Vampires, Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist you will have to come to the conclusion, that Suspiria, although obviously inspired by the aforementioned, has nothing new to add.I rate it a C-movie! p.s.: The movie's title is Suspiria, not Suspira!!",Suspiria
460,sjgallagher-39405,Fantastic style and outrageous acting and plot,3,10 December 2020,"Suspiria is not a well made film, and that is the only way to start this review. Because as much as I loved the style, with the colors and the soundtrack (which were amazing!), it is undeniably poorly made and poorly thought out.I went into the movie with high expectations, but tempered by the age and the low budget. I am no film snob, but I've seen many, many movies, and I rarely complain about a film. And to be fair, I'm not complaining about this either! But if I could just review some of the salient features of Suspiria I think my point would be made: this is a stylistic movie, but bizarrely acted and poorly edited.In the opening, Pat runs out into the rain and comes upon a hotel of some sort, and meets a girl there. It's not clear that they know each other, and the dubs are made very obvious. The host leaves Pat in her room, when suddenly a window breaks, and the host girl goes absolutely crazy, screaming bloody murder (literally, 'there's a murderer!'). The murderer is never revealed (though we can assume it's the burly man who brings food) and the Cheshire cat eyes never are explained.The maggot scene was creepy crawly, and served to get the girls to all sleep together in a room, but then, nothing happens. It's not clear why the maggots were infesting (beyond something rotten in the attic) and nobody bothers about it again. There's no reason for this to happen, it is irrelevant, and the time could be better used anywhere else.Susie's 3rd year roommate is introduced, has a couple scenes, and then never appears again.The psychiatrist scene is my favorite. It begins with a sign saying ""Psychiatrist and Psychologist Convention"", then Susie is meeting with some man there, and it's not clear who this person is or how she knows him. But he helpfully informs Susie that her friend ""was my patient. I am a psychiatrist. Did you know that?"" Susie responds, ""No, I did not know you were a psychiatrist!"", and he says, ""Yes."" That's some of the most stilted exposition I have ever seen, especially considering he, too, has very little to do with anything. This man also has an encyclopedic knowledge of the school and its origins, despite brushing off the subject moments before. He points Susie to the older German psychiatrist who happens to know a lot about witches, and is somehow exactly right regarding the current situation, but that's par for the course in horror movies, and I'd be more offended if they didn't do that!The death of Susie's friend is very strange. She is chased by a killer, but he is unable to open a door latch using some kind of spatula. Undeterred, he continues to try and flip the latch for what feels like an hour, while Susie's friend builds an impromptu staircase to escape through a window. A window which, by the way, is on the top floor or attic of this building.And yet, Susie's friend leaps through the window without looking, and falls into a pit of razor wire. I love the razor wire pit business, but what was the alternative? Her falling three stories to her death? Even in the panic and fear of the chase, you have to look where you're going before you jump out of a window so high off the ground, especially when you have time at your side.In the end, nothing much comes about.The woman pronounces her own name, Markos, as ""Marcus"", but I can let that slide. The bat attack was terribly done but the budget was low and Argento had a vision for the scene so points for commitment. The slow stabbing in the beginning, and the dog attack, are both highlights of course. Though it's not clear with the dog attack why the blind man's dog acted out in the first place, drawing the wrath of the witches. And finally, the question of whether the entire school was in on the witch coven, or just the teachers, is solved neatly by simply burning everyone to death. The bizarre texture of the 'red wine' Susie pours down the drain makes me wonder if it was supposed to look like blood, or maybe they really didn't want to put a few dollars towards the wine, but I liked it anyway. The list of oddities goes on, making you wonder if the whole thing is allegorical or metaphorical, but I think that might be giving Argento too much credit. Still, I would recommend the movie to horror fans, I'm just surprised nobody mentions how terrible the film is as, you know, a film.",Suspiria

462,zorbasag,A great horror film with beautiful visuals and a memorable soundtrack,10,10 February 2017,"Dario Argento's Classic is certainly something to be admired. A stark contrast to his previous work: With a story reminiscent of a dark fairy-tale in opposition to his mainly realistic giallo plots, he moves the action from urban settings to a dreamlike Ballet Academy, beautifully shot with lush colors being one of the last films to utilize the Technicolor post-production treatment (the film was shot in EastmanColour prints but was processed using Technicolor's system, not filmed in the 3-strip technique which hadn't been used since the 50s as opposed to popular belief). The cinematography is remarkable, especially if you have the restored edition on DVD or Blu-Ray. It has an interesting story, knows well how to create an ominous atmosphere and manages to be both horrific and beautiful, especially during the ending when the gore is contrasted with the rich colors in one of the films most visually interesting scenes. The Goblin Soundtrack is also great, utilizing a relatively simple array of organs with Claudio Simonetti whispering creating a truly unnerving result. However not all is perfect. The whole film is dubbed in either English or Italian since it was a common business practice at the time. The dubbing while OK is a little dodgy in some parts especially with Suxy Bannion and Pat's Landlord. It sounds quite off and can distract in some parts. Also while the gore is impressive the blood is a little too red and seems more like tomato sauce. It is however definitely one of Argento's Best and I'd definitely recommend it.",Suspiria

In a style where sudden visual shocks are used to thrill the audience, Argento creates elaborate deaths which cannot be quickly forgotten.  The highly involved double-murder towards the beginning of the film still remains one of the most memorable scenes in horror history, standing next to the Psycho ""shower scene"" in pure sensory input. And in a technique so powefully employed here and here alone, Argento sets scene after scene aglow with color, using it to express the mood in ways only the subconscious can fully appreciate.  All around, this is an excellent addition to the genre of horror cinema, one of the most expressive films to ever plunge a knife into the psyche of its viewers.",Suspiria
467,argyle99,Boooooriiiinnnggg!!!,3,20 July 2001,"After hearing so many good reviews of this movie I decided to rent it and hoped for the best. I was really disappointed. First of all, the soundtrack is incredibly annoying and far too loud. The tense moments are ruined by ridiculous violent sequences that seem to have been spliced into the movie after it was made. The dog scene? Give me a break! Argento ruins every single scary moment in the movie. And yes, he makes good use of colors, etc. to create a sense of style, but all the style is severely dated as well as overdone. A waste of time, unless you're a fan of Italian horror I guess.",Suspiria

Well, tonight I rented the DVD and I have to say this movie is laughable with bad acting, little story and no suspense. Director Argento's attempts to build suspense fail miserably until you are left bored and looking at the clock. Particularly silly is a scene where the lead character is attacked by a bat that gets stuck in her hair. You can almost see the wire that the bat is hanging from.  Also, the fake blood they use looks nothing like blood. Perhaps they should move this movie to the comedy section of my video rental store. Perhaps maybe in the seventies this was cutting edge (excuse the pun) horror, but by todays standards the big scare I got is that I actually paid to view this piece of Eurocrap. Probably the most horrorfying experience I will have this year is reading reviews of this movie that describe it as a ""Masterpiece of Horror"".

469,smp33,A truly beautiful and powerful horror opus,10,1 December 2007,"The nineteen seventies were a great decade for horror films..and one of the very best was this masterpiece from the king of Italian horror..the legend that is Dario Argento.The story..such as it is...goes like this.A young ballet student Suzy Banyon(Jessica Harper)enrols at a dance school(run by British actress Joan Bennett..in what turned out to be her last film)little knowing,like the rest of students,that this school is really a witches coven...and these witches will stop at nothing to kill every single last student there.It soon becomes clear when you watch ""Suspiria"" that writing scripts is not Dario Argentos strongest ability..what is however is his ability to craft a great horror film..With help from the gifted Italian cameraman Luciano Tivoli(who would re team with Argento on his other great film ""Tenebrae"" and then go to be D.O.P on such films as ""Single White Female"")he creates some of horrors most incredible moments..from the amazing and very bloody opening 12 minutes to the macabre but astonishing scene featuring one of the students and a room full of barbed wire!!!!.A nod should also go to the movies magnificent score written by Argento and his friends..the band Goblin.In short..""Suspiria"" is one of the most impressive horror films of the past 30 years and a great starting point for anyone who wants to make a great horror film(that and Hitchcocks ""Psycho"").Don't miss it...but don't watch it alone...whatever you do.Stephen's rating ***** out of *****",Suspiria
470,R_Redbeard,A Nightmare Comedy,4,13 September 2013,"This was the 3rd Argento film I've seen and it is just as bad as Inferno and Tenebre. As soon as the main b*tch was walking through the airport I knew I was again in for the stupid light bulb bullsh*t. He can take his red, green, blue, purple etc. bulbs and shove them up his *ss. I think there's a torture porn video of a guy breaking glass in his rectum and there's no doubt in my mind that it was somehow influenced by his hate for the ""visionary"" lighting skills of Dario Argento. Except for that, the opening scene made it seem like this might actually be a good film. Good use of the camera, editing and location....same for Inferno with the underwater scene. The filming from the trees was pretty good too (besides the shitty flood light) but it all turned to C grade ""horror"" during the 1st murder. The b*tch is screaming about a murderer even though she can't get in the room to see what's happening. There's a hairy arm smushing the other c*nt's face on the window? Maybe the arm belonged to the hairy monster in The Lords of Salem.In grade school I used to build gory sets in the entrance of our house every Halloween and the paint blood I used looked pretty similar to Argento's paint blood... I'd like to think my sets were scarier than Argento's because they probably were. Speaking of sets, they were suppose to be the best thing about this film and I've seen numerous people say how psychedelic they were. N*gger please. You can actually see places on the walls where they didn't put even layers of paint. They were also using acrylic (doesn't reflect light) and enamel (reflects light) black paint on some of the walls. Light reflecting paint actually looks natural and I think that's what he wanted but I guess they must've f*cked that up somehow or ran out and had to use the cheap stuff. The railing looked like Styrofoam spray painted with gold...terrible. Lesson: gold spray paint does not make an object look like polished brass. Speaking of the railing...why were there windows around it? That wall was just 'there' even though it had nothing to do with the foundation of the building if you looked at it from the outside. Anyway, the rest of the set had a high school play quality to it and many of the hand painted designs were probably painted by high school kids. However, that doesn't mean this movie was better than a high school play...One of the funniest parts was the pointless and non-nonsensical killing of blind Adam Sandler by his own German Shepherd. Or did it kill him because he had some raw meat on his neck...? Hopefully one day they'll address this point in an ultra deluxe Criterion blu-ray release. What else? The maggots... totally visionary. ""People think maggots are creepy...lets get some maggots."" Same with the bat. ""Bats...hmmm."" The room with the giant slinky was brilliant. When I was a little kid I decided to get myself stuck in a slinky during nap time at a babysitter's house but she walked in before I got out. I had my *ss whooped so it brings back the fear.Why is that Austrian woman smiling all the time? Are her teeth bleached? How can she teach ballet when she uses a cane? Mysteries, mysteries.Then there's the whole dubbing English over Italians mouthing English words thing... Bat sh*t insane. Just speak Italian and subtitle it. There would've been much more time left over to fix the many other problems in the film. But oh well, what can you do? All in all I cannot see Dario as a visionary even in the slightest sense. The man does not possess the skill set for film making. At best, he's just some guy who has never been good at anything in his life but somehow managed to acquire enough money to make movies. He masquerades his accidents as intentional and his short-sightedness as artwork. I can see how maybe some grade school kids eating freeze pops or a group of stoners looking for some laughs might be entertained by this but beyond that I think there's little of value here. The best thing about the film is the soundtrack and the f*cking wallpaper.",Suspiria
471,MDzyban,What????,3,10 July 2001,"I am, in fact, a great lover of horror films and actively search out new horror experiences. Sometimes they are rewarding, often they are not. Like many other films of less pedigree I did not find Suspiria to be particularly rewarding. I had, through various sources, heard about the ""exceptional"" artistic craftsmanship of Dario Argento's films and so I eagerly sought them out. I eventually saw both Suspiria and equally unimpressive Creepers (the U.S. cut of Phenomena). I sat through Suspiria and attempted to swallow the wafer-thin plot and cardboard performances. (Note to filmmakers: If you don't speak English and 95% of your cast doesn't either...pick another language.), only to await an incredibly predictable and poorly executed climax. (Though not as laughable as aforementioned ""Creepers"".) The camera work, although satisfactory, is hardly groundbreaking (Interested parties check its predecessor: Blood and Black Lace). I am truly astounded by the adoration this film receives. Aside from a few flourishing moments the rest of the movie was lackluster and it seems like the main character eventually just trips into the finale.Perhaps I'm lacking in the historical context of 1977 cinema to understand why this film is supposed to stand out. Though considering its contemporaries counted Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Eraserhead I'm still baffled. Suspiria would hardly scare a 10 year old at a slumber party let alone someone old enough buy a ticket for it at a movie theatre. Be wary humble viewers, there are worse films in the world but why try to find them?",Suspiria

I mean, okay the color scheme and lighting are influenced by Snow White - the camera angles and styling are kind of avant-garde. The doorknobs are hung high to give it a bit unsettling feeling, yet the decors looks totally like made from cardboard. The screechy soundtrack is supposed to be scary, but it's mostly just too loud and too repetitive. The balance between the volume of the dialogue and music is totally off. And come on.. it never ever gets truly frightening. The blood and gore looks completely unrealistic and nothing about the story is really creepy. Combined with a terribly slow pace and typical overacting of the lead characters, which is a waste, as the cast in itself was decent.. But since there's hardly any character's development, so there's little to none engagement with the viewer. I can't imagine how this scared or marveled anyone - not even back in 1977 - it's just not so good.",Suspiria

And the acting not really above par. The end is agonizingly simple and uncomplicated. Its as if the story waited to be rushed in at the end.The music however deserves a mention. It builds the necessary anticipation. Only to have it squashed by the deliverables. There are gaping loopholes in the story, which scream to be filled.

It had an interesting plot and setting, the best tag-line I've ever heard, and came with great recommendations to boot...but this one just didn't work.  For example,  the music balances on the apparently thin line between horror music and porno music.  I was unaware the two were so closely related but this movie made it obvious.  This is one of many reasons why the movie just didn't frighten me. Some of the camera work is very well done and eerie, and some of it is just...awkward and even humorous (i.e. seeing a pair of mysterious hairy arms come from off screen and grab a rope).  Indeed, a lot of this movie made me laugh out loud at the poor work put behind it.  Yes, I know it was made along time ago, but ""The Exorcist"" came four years before ""Suspiria"" and it lacks any of these amateurish (there, I said it) elements.  The music is weird and off color, the lighting is flamboyant and out of place, and the camera work is just plain embarassing.  This is why the movie just was not scary in any way, shape, or form (which is too bad because fright value is the only real reason to see this movie).  By the way, an old snoring woman IS NOT SCARY EITHER...despite Mr. Argento's ideas.  Any of you who have seen the film know what I'm talking about.

The acting is so wooden and laughable. The script makes no sense, plenty of holes and scenes that have nothing to do with anything in the plot.
The music is obnoxious! Loud and just goofy as hell. It definitely takes away from the film. I can't believe people actually like this movie.

476,LuxNatalis,"More like a fairytale, than a film",10,14 October 2009,"Suspiria's reviews are usually similar on its positive and negative parts alike. This is a ''visually stunning'' horror film with great atmosphere and amazing colors, widely considered as Dario Argento's best achievement. At the same time, the performances are ''wooden'' and its plot is ''weak''.I like to think of this film more as an experience than as a standard movie with normal actors and a typical script, mainly because it is one of my favorite films. Had I judged it with my usual criteria, I'd have found flaws almost everywhere in the plot and the actors' lines; instead I chose to be let into the fairytale, drifted away by the blue, the red and the yellow paints and eventually lost in its beautiful maze. It's not important that initially there seems to be no princess, no mirrors and no evil stepmothers, only brutal murders and cheesy dialog; it's still a fairytale and they're all there, you'll discover them if you liked fairy tales as a child and if you let yourself into the atmosphere. A masterpiece of film history, independent of genre, an eerie feeling in your hearts and a stylish wonder within an utterly bizarre movie that resembles no other.My vote is 10.",Suspiria
477,burgerline08,A classic horror film that moves with the logic of a nightmare,8,8 November 2002,"The postings deriding Suspira compelled me to write a review of my own. The main complaint seems to be that the story makes no sense, the acting is wooden, and the blood bright red.  These are all correct observations, but most ""real"" horror fans will tell you that it is the film's atmosphere that matters.  Ambiance is the whole point of Suspiria.  The set designs are drenched in blazing primary colors; this was done on purpose to create a surreal, dreamlike quality.  The blood is bright red to match the extreme technicolor scheme.  There is little in this film that is lucid, which is its greatest attribute.  Sure, there is a decent plot about witches, but the narrative is PURPOSELY kept at bay to give the viewer a disoriented effect. Some may say Argento is hiding an ineptness in story telling with garish sets and effects, but check out ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" or ""Deep Red""(UNCUT), which are very sophisticated murder mysteries.  The dialog is often times generic and is the one thing I can see as a valid complaint; but, it is really there to propel the story and take the viewer further into Argento's funhouse of images. I'll take that over some pretentious horror film that has pedestrian ""after school special"" sub-plots and cornball pop as its soundtrack.",Suspiria

But... I like Suspiria which attracted my attention to itself from the beginning and this interest never stopped. Filming of the opening scene Suzy arrived to Germany in a stormy and rainy day, and two mystery words that Pat said when she is fleeing from the ballet school was a precursor of an above-average horror movie. Along with the murder of Pat, I admitted that I will see the color RED every second in the movie. Blood is RED, locality is RED, wine is RED, and shooting is also RED... Director's use of crimson in scenes extremely fits in this movie when we think that the all witches desire to kill someone who stands up to them. This contributes fifty percentage to the movie's success!The rest of Suspiria's achievement comes from Goblin which is an Italian progressive rock band. This band composed the soundtrack of Suspiria and well-known one is title track ""Suspiria"" comprised of old fashioned keyboard tunes which pulls you into darkness. Besides, death call arises when you hear the voice of witch in background. I listened it all night. Did you?These two reasons are enough to like Suspiria or spare time at least, but the irrefutable fact of the movie is that IT IS HARD NOT TO ABANDON YOURSELF TO THRILLER.",Suspiria
480,saintmikeone,Wow...,10,11 September 2009,"This is, simply put, one of the greatest horror films ever made. Considering the heavy gore, it may not be everyone's cup of tea. However, if you are half as interested in film as I am, you own it to yourself. See this movie.The film deals with an American ballet student, named Suzy Bannion, who enrolls into a strange German dance academy. There, she learns of the death of Pat Hingle. Pat was viciously killed during Suzy's arrival in the midst of a grisly storm. Soon, more and more people soon begin to disappear at the hands of an unknown, malevolent force...Minus a bogus storyline and some lackluster acting, this film is visually stunning. And, at the risk of sounding like a sicko, its murder set pieces are gorgeous and exhilarating. The sets are rich, the cinematography is sharp, the score is astounding, and the atmosphere is right on the mark. This is how horror movies should be. Shocking. Beautiful. Vicious. Dream-like.

481,chris99stang,So much potential is lost on uninspiring characters,7,19 April 2003,"Like many other IMDB reviewers I have heard this movie mentioned frequently as one of the scariest of all time.  Not until recently have I delved into the Euro-Horrors, and even though I wasn't impressed by Argento's ""Demons"", I figured I would give this movie a shot.I have seen many a horror movie, and I have to say that the musical score by Goblin is by far, one of the best horror scores of all time.  Yes, it deserves a place right up there with Carpenter's music (Halloween, The Fog) and it works so well to build the tension, you have to wonder how much more bland the movie would be without it's eerie presence.  Since it is used heavily in the movie, it plays with your psyche.Some of the visuals and architecture in this movie are stunning, and on more than one occasion I pinched myself and told me this wasn't Kubrick, but Argento.  His gratuitous use of Red and other overtoned colors pulls you into the story as if you were watching a fairy tale, the menacing outside shots of the school (looking up at it) make it seem as it's an entity of it's own.  The opening scene in which you see the student running through the dark woods, cloaked in white is unnerving - and when she looks out the window of her room.. the eyes.  Horrifying.  At a few points in the movie, when you first start discovering that the school hides an evil secret, the tension is wonderful.  Fear of the unknown, exploring the footsteps of the teachers and the path which they lead, it definitely preys upon your imagination and will have you clinging to the edge of your seat.  Death could come from anywhere.  Especially beautiful is the courtyard death scene, with ominous architecture peering out of the darkness upon the prey in the center - in the light.So much potential it made me angry that the movie falls apart on so many levels.  To be a psychological horror, you MUST identify with the characters.  You must crawl inside their fear, you must form some sort of emotional bond with them, you have to care whether they live or die.  From the beginning of the movie the pacing seems way off, it's long, drawn out and quite simply boring.  Not until the second half does it start to redeem itself slightlty.  If the plot was worked on, there were better actors and it was edited properly this really could have ranked up there as one of the best horror movies ever made.I won't comment too much on the special effects because I know this was a low budget production, and it was the seventies.  Yes, the bat scene is laughable and painful to watch.  The barbed wire clearly has no razor edges on it.  The dog puppet is ridiculous.  The blood is so fake you swear you were looking at a kool-aid and ketchup composite.  But if you can suspend criticism of pre-CGI special effects and overlook these props it helps.I can't really recommend this movie to the casual horror viewer, because quite frankly they will look past the beautiful cinematic moments and focus on the weak story and bad acting.  But for those of us who also judge movies from an artistic side, there are definitely some pleasures to be had with this film.7 out of 10 for the moments of beauty and tension that could have played out into so much more.",Suspiria
482,MatthewSchmitz,Lower Expectations,6,8 August 2017,"I consider myself to be a pretty big fan of Horror/Cult/B-Movies. This film had been on my watchlist for a long time, and I was very excited to see it! I had super high expectations from what I had heard online, and even now as I am writing this it's sitting at a 92 on Rotten Tomatoes. After seeing the film I can't understand how it can possibly have a score that high.From what I have gathered online, some other people feel the same way. The movie becomes an argument of ""style vs. substance."" I will say, the style is amazing. I loved the soundtrack, especially in the opening moments of the film which had me wondering if I was going crazy... and it reminded me of ""The Shining"" in some ways. Stylistically, I also enjoyed the sets and colors of the film which I found very interesting and helped with the whole nightmarish theme. Unfortunately for me, all of this style cannot help me overlook the insane lack of substance to the film. For a movie to be this well regarded I was expecting a lot more in terms of story. One of the most painful things about this movie is the dialogue. Let me pause here a moment. Yes, I am aware that the story was originally supposed to involve a much younger cast, but then the script should have been changed.The dialogue is very childish, which I could possibly ignore... if that was my only problem. It's the combination of terrible dialogue and terrible dubbing that make it pretty unbearable. One of the words in the movie, ""Occult,"" was never said without sounding totally bizarre and had me cracking up. In connection with the dialogue, there were a lot of odd plot holes to this film that could have had sweet pay offs. One example, Pavlo, the giant freaky school handyman/butler was set up with this gem of dialogue:""This is Pavlo, our general handyman. He's really ugly, isn't he? Don't be afraid to say so. Can't understand you anyway, he speaks only Romanian. You see that gorgeous smile? He's felt very handsome ever since he got those false teeth.""Sadly, he and other odd and interesting looking characters are introduced but do absolutely nothing later on in the film.A part of me did really enjoy watching this movie. This is the type of late night horror movie you can mock as you watch with friends, but also has fantastic music and color at times. The part that bothers me, and perhaps I'll get over in time, is the weird, super high praise this movie is given. It might be the the most overrated horror film I've seen. My advice is to go in with low expectations and you'll have a fun time.",Suspiria

This movie is Argento's masterpiece and no one can deny it.The movie stands out not because of the story (which is not something extremely innovative) but because of the excellent mix of strange sounds, curious camera angles and abundance of color that make the viewer believe that he has entered another world from the moment the protagonist enters the ballet academy. It should be noted that there are some scenes that border on gore.Overall it is a movie that I enjoyed a lot because it was a very could mix of its elements and it is certainly one of the best horror movies I have seen.",Suspiria

Now, when it comes to explaining ""dream-like premise"", people go too far into rationalizing the negative aspects of the film as intentional. No, the acting is bad and was not made to feel like a dream. The dubbing is very off and sometimes distracting, and while the fact that they are not English speakers is unfortunate, I can't not take that into consideration while I talk about the film.The focus and the objective of the film is not about the straightforward plot or the acting, but is about the other-worldly ambience that the colours, music builds and the cinematography, making these aspects an extension of the subject of horror rather than the props. Some of the camera work, set design and gore scenes reminded me of some of the B-grade horror movies I've seen. I don't mean that it cheapens the quality, but it is just an observation. In fact, there isn't a lot of gore here either.All the negatives aside, this is still a captivating horror film that has clearly influenced a lot of horror and thrillers movies that came after this.

486,kentishmaid21,Interesting Film,7,14 January 2004,"On the whole, I thought that this was a good film.  The storyline, while fantastic, held together and had its own internal logic. Suzy Bannion is a new pupil at a dance school in Germany with rather peculiar staff.  A series of bizarre murders take place and Suzy sets out to find out what's going on, with the aid of a friend of one of the dead girls. She is horrified by what she discovers.......The acting was good (although the dubbing was not always the greatest) and it was shot very well - predominantly dark and brooding to emphasise the evil that was at work.  I also particularly liked the use of red, blue and green filters.  Presumably there is some great symbolic meaning to this, but other than the red heralding the occasional gore that was to follow, I'm afraid that I have singularly failed to see what this might be.Suzy's vulnerability, and the fact that the majority of the action happens within the dance school should have helped to maintain the tension, as the rather bizarre murders begin to take place.  The gestapo like teachers were suitably horrid.  However, the music which was presumably meant to heighten the fear and lead us up to the grizly climax just began to grate after a while.  This meant that, despite the fact that I scare quite easily (I didn't like the scarab beetles in the Mummy, for example) I wasn't actually terribly frightened.At only just over one and a half hours in length, though, it is well worth a watch as it certainly does not outstay its welcome.  Good, eerie entertainment.  If you enjoyed this, then I would recommend 'Don't Look Now' - an equally eerie (and slightly superior) horror thriller from the same era.",Suspiria

The first thing you'll notice are colors. They are very intense and contrast and it looks really nice.The other things work much worse however.The plot is very thin, almost non existing. Everything seems very weird, exaggerated. and surreal, like a dream. People have no personalities. Death scenes and especially blood are very fake. It makes you not care at all if someone is going to be killed. Needless to add that you feel no fear at all.At some moments, out of nothing, some terrible and loud music is being played. It's a cacophony painful to your ears, just like someone banged on metal dishes. It doesn't add fear, it doesn't add thrill, it's just awful.

It isn't the kind of horror film that gives you nightmares, rather a film that will give you strange vivid dreams; the kind you don't forget. Whenever I hear the opening score it sends a little reminiscent shiver up my spine from when I first had the opportunity to see it. Suspiria begins with rather an odd story, about a girl arriving in Germany to attend one of the most prestigious dance schools in Europe. We immediately feel her bewilderment at being in a new place as she tries to hail a taxi from the airport entrance. I shouldn't reveal much as I think this film is best viewed when all you have read is the caption on the cover: ""The only thing more terrifying than the last 12 minutes of this film are the first 92"", which is true! The biggest achievement in this film, alongside the creepy suspense, is Argento's use of color and set design. The films vivid set pieces and different color themes make it look a strange hallucinogenic daydream. If you consider yourself a horror fan, I suggest you watch this film. This film got me into Giallo and Italian horror, full stop. If you enjoyed this film check out ""The House With Laughing Windows"". Not as good but a brilliant Giallo film in itself.",Suspiria
491,theclaretmartyr,truly a classic horror movie,10,18 February 2005,"Argento's use of color is what makes this movie special, i must admit the plot was bad, but how that differs from most other horror movie i do not know, many reviews state that the acting is terrible i personally found no problem with it. And the first death scene is truly one of the most gruesome, amazingly shot death i've ever seen. It would be worth a viewing for that scene alone. And of course there is the amazingly perfect Goblin soundtrack, I find that song quite enjoyable to listen outside of the movie, and it creates such a feeling of dread in the movie, all in all its just what it should be.",Suspiria
492,JohnGardicotis,Where do I even begin?,2,6 January 2014,"Suspiria is a film about a ballet dancer named Suzy who moves from New York to some European dance academy. I just want to start off by saying the first 10 minutes were fantastic (The death scene reminded me of Drew Barrymore's death in ""Scream"".) But after that it is all downhill.The plot and the acting was terrible. The film was boring and not scary at all. Now people might see the IMDb score of 7.4/10 but the truth is that I feel like getting the DVD (Which I bought) and flushing it down the toilet.To conclude I tried to like this film but nothing happened and the ending was shocking. Is it too late to send it back?",Suspiria
493,liveonppv,Worst Horror Movie I've Ever Seen!!! A Big Waste of time!,4,22 April 2006,"I just don't get it.After reading all the reviews and comments people made about this movie I decided to rent it and thought to myself,How the hell did I miss such a good horror movie? Well,after a promising 5 minutes or so where they introduce the American student in the airport and start off with the weird music score the movie turns into a big joke.Not only is this movie not scary at all,and I've seen a lot of scary movies in my life , it also has some serious dubbing problem and lip sync.When the foreigners in this movie speak it almost sounds like a cheap Kung Fu movie.The music sometimes just doesn't stop when it should.It gave me a headache!All the parts that are supposed to be scary are laughable and amateurish at best.The only reason I rented this movie was because John Carpenter who directed the perfect horror film in Halloween said this movie influenced him a lot.How can this crap inspire anyone????You want to watch a good scary movie? Go rent Halloween,The Exorcism,Hell Night, and The Exorcism Of Emily Rose which made my nights terrible for about 2 weeks...Don't watch Suspiria unless you don't know anything about horror films!!! 4/10!",Suspiria
494,portsoyboy,"Nope, Still Don't Get It",5,23 January 2011,"I've tried, really I have. That's the third or fourth Argento movie I've watched and I understand this one is generally regarded as his finest work but I just don't get the hype.I get the fact that it's full of lush primary colours and I get the fact that the score is load and full-on and I even get all the reviewers on here describing it as some sort of 'feast for the senses' that concentrates more on atmosphere than actual horror. But (and it's a John Candy-sized but) the film, just like all the other Argento efforts I've watched, just leaves me cold.Key question for a scary movie - is it scary? Nope. The director has a few good moments (making an airport sliding door intimidating - that's clever) but they're so interspersed with long periods of blandness that they can't maintain any effect. Even the death scenes - not scary. The blind pianist being mauled by his own dog? Laughable. I know special effects in 1977 weren't exactly Avatar standard but surely they could have shelled out a few extra quid for a fake dog's head that actually looked vaguely like a dog's head? Very little plot - no problem with that - but what little there was got mangled by an atrocious language track.Not to say that this is a movie entirely without merit. The settings and colours are great to look at, Jessica Harper was good and the cook/housekeeper was suitably menacing. In the end though, this might be Argento's best work but that still doesn't make it particularly good.",Suspiria
495,joe_ovalle2003,Loved Suspiria!,10,20 August 2006,"This is one of the best Horror movies i have ever seen. Everything from the music to the story is mysterious, and scary. I had heard about this movie from all my friends and they mentioned how good it was, and how i had to see it. It really never got my attention but i decided to buy it and when i saw it i fell in love with it. There is a lot of art in this movie, and i love all the bright colors, the editing, the music, and the lighting. Horror movies now look to fake and rarely have that Thrill that makes you want to scream. Suspiria is not a perfect film, and it has its flaws but its a Horror classic that everyone should watch.",Suspiria
496,jordan-64422,Dario Argento's Atmosphere and Tone Save an Otherwise Subpar Plot,7,28 June 2017,"An issue that most horror films from the current era have is that they fail to develop atmosphere and tension, or set a tone that could leave the hairs on the back of your neck standing. They tend to just throw paper-thin characters into the plot and then have them killed without any sort of build-up. Dario Argento gives us Suspiria as an example of how to use technique and skill to build an atmosphere that is chilling, so that even if your characters or plot are lacking, you still have yourself a hell of a tone that could still leave an imprint on the collective brains of the audience.Jessica Harper plays Suzy Bannion, an American ballet dancer who has come to Germany to attend the prestigious Tanz Dance Academy. She arrives on a stormy night, and one of the neat tricks Argento pulls happens in the first few minutes of the story. When the doors of the airport open/close, the creepy and atmospheric music by the prog rock group Goblin seeps in/out, almost as if Argento was letting the audience know that anything outside sounds like it could be life- threatening. Sure enough, when Suzy arrives at the academy, she sees another young woman run out of the school as if she were running for her life. That young woman is later killed in a most gory fashion by an unseen stalker. Well, mostly unseen. Suzy is welcomed into the academy and is introduced to the instructor Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and the vice-director, Miss Blanc (Joan Bennett) who seem like respectful folk, except when Miss Tanner pushes Suzy through a practice even though Suzy looks like she's going to pass out at any second. Then there is an issue with maggots infesting everything, forcing staff and students to camp out in the practice hall for the night. Apparently, it was due to boxes of spoiled food in the attic but what that has to do with the plot, who knows. Suzy becomes friends with Sara, who used to be friends with the late Pat, the young woman who fled the academy in the beginning, and she shares with Suzy stories of Pat and some strange happenings in the school. Of course, later on Sara herself meets a similar fate as Pat only this time thanks to some conveniently placed razor wire. A hell of a lot of razor wire. Then there is an incident with the school's blind piano player and his guide dog. It all adds up to something strange going on at Tanz Dance Academy and Suzy is in the middle of it all. Unfortunately, the story presented here by screenwriters Argento and Dario Nicolodi leaves some questions unanswered and provides very little details where more could have helped, as well as the occasional gaps in logic. However, the scares provided in the story are chill-inducing and legitimately frightening, and this is a credit to Argento and his skill.Argento applies his trademarks throughout the film with several artistic flourishes. The production design and cinematography (by Luciano Tovoli) emphasize vivid colors such as blue, green and yellow. Red is especially used throughout, giving the film an intentionally unrealistic nightmarish quality. Whatever is missing in terms of story here is more than made up for with a haunting, dreamlike atmosphere and a tone that will keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting for the next gory killing. The score by Goblin is excellent and greatly helps establish the tone of the film.Jessica Harper leads the cast as Suzy. Harper was previously seen in Brian De Palma's rock and/or roll horror opera The Phantom of the Paradise so she has a bit of experience with this type of role. However, like the rest of the cast, her voice work is overdubbed, even though she speaks English. When English-speaking actors have to re-record some of their own voice work, this can impact the dramatic effect of the dialogue. It can even, at times, be a little corny, especially near the end of the film when the big secret of the school is revealed. Harper does an admirable job but it is almost difficult to judge the rest of the cast with all the dubbing going on here. The end result is a film that is quite adept at setting a tone and providing impactful imagery that is meant to frighten an audience. Suspiria does that quite properly and is highly regarded in that respect. If Argento and Nicolodi could have somehow created a tighter story and had not left so many gaps or unanswered questions, Suspiria could have been something great. As it is, we are left with a merely ""very good"" film that will scare the pants off most viewers.",Suspiria
497,rikdebeul,Doesn't live up to the hype,3,13 December 2018,"In light of its recent remake, which I haven't seen yet, I had high expectations of the original. All throughout the film I couldn't stop thinking whether there was something that I was misssing. I get that there is some funky lighting, some baroque set dressing going on and a rather interesting soundtrack. But that's about it. The story is non-existent and the acting is horrendous.",Suspiria

499,chuckeames,Best Horror Movie Ever,10,2 November 2005,"Maybe I wasn't thinking of a scary movie when I went to see this. Maybe it was the title that mystified me into believing it was just a suspenseful movie. Well, 30 seconds into this thriller and I was having a goosebump attack. Then, 5-10 minutes in and I was actually scared. And I don't scare easily. This is not just about blood and gore, although there's a good share of that. This movie has the finest cinematography, music and sets that draw you into a frighteningly, scary experience. I hate to go into details because I feel it ruins a first view experience. Even talking it up like this will lesson the impact by causing high expectations. Leave it to say this is my all time favorite horror movie!",Suspiria

I will admit, I wasn't as crazy about the first time I watched it as I was the second time. You really have to pay attention to understand what's what and who's who. The colors are absolutely beautiful, they remind me a lot of a Walt Disney movie. Suspiria's dream-like sense makes it very suspenseful. I loved how everything was just so random, this is a film that definitely does not follow any rules. I caught this movie on Christmas Eve on the IFC (International film channel), the lead actress Jessica Harper is perfect as Suzy Banyon. She really delivered a lot of innocence to the role. When you watch this film, do not expect anything totally scary. Any horror fan should truly check this out.",Suspiria
501,imavrin,A masterpiece form the king of macabre,9,19 December 2005,"There are few directors which enjoy such support as the king of the macabre - Dario Argento. Although the plots in his movies aren't on the highest level, the characters are not convincing enough and all-in-all, the actors are not the best available, his works are very high-esteemed among horror fans. He may be lousy script-writer, but he is one hell of a director. He scares you a lot when you least expect it, and that is what horrors suppose to do (don't they?). Surprising moments are not his only weapon. There are also colors which he uses in most scary scenes. And while most horror movies are dark, Argento's works scream with yellow, blue, green and - especially - red color. The atmosphere in this ""giallo"" masterpiece is also built with a horrific soundtrack written (and performed) by Goblin. To summarize, the director of ""Suspiria"" and ""Phenomena"" maybe don't deserve an Oscar, but he surely deserves glorification.",Suspiria

The film is dubbed all the way through - the theme music is a rip off of Halloween (which is accompanied by a ""south park"" LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA) which to me make's it very cheesy, but laughable.It didn't make me jump once, rather all the way through I was wondering what the hell was going on half the time, or course the acting is top notch - NOT!!!!

I do believe that Dario Agrento is in The Goblins, how cool is that. At first I was skeptical but the movie held my full attention all the away through. Jessica Harper Is great in this film perfect for the role and very pretty if I might add. This movie is definitely my kind of cult classic film. It combined a great combination of suspense, tasteful violence blood & gore (which I love), a very deep well thought out unpredictable plot, several scary camera tricks and a great twist at the end.

504,ripsnark,The most overrated horror movie ever made,2,21 August 2002,"Based on all the rave reviews of this turkey, I blew $15 on the THX-certified anamorphic widescreen DTS-ES super duper DVD.  Why did they bother with this?  This movie was not even the tiniest bit scary, and the only reason I made it through to the end without falling asleep was that I kept expecting SOMETHING to happen to justify all the excitement.  I keep hearing about how brilliant and awesome the soundtrack is; well, I've got all the hardware to listen to the DTS-ES track in all it's 7.1 glory and I was more annoyed by it than anything.  It's too loud in most places and drowns out the conversation in others, and further, it's not all that spooky or even good.  The soundtrack for The Exorcist and even Alien was 1000 times better than this goofy dreck.  I also keep reading about all the excitement over the lighting.  The lighting, folks, is silly.  Argento must have used up the entire world supply of red, blue, and green gels.  Ooo -- see the dark room with the character backlit by weird green light coming from no source!  Eek -- see the weird red spots playing over the wall from nowhere. Come on, it's lame, lame, lame.  I've seen better lighting in my neighbor's Halloween haunted house.  And don't get me started with the goofy plot, well described by others here.  Witches?  Running a dance school?  Killed in 2 seconds flat by a pointy stick?  Sheesh, give me a break.The only good thing about this movie is that now that know what the ""classic"" and ""scariest horror movie of all time"" is, I won't have to waste any more of my money buying stuff like this pathetic drivel.  You drooling fans owe me $15 and 2 hours of my life back!

I was almost sucked in to buying this garbage sight unseen based on the reviews.  Thank all that is holy that my boyfriend stopped me and suggested I rent it first.  If this is the Citizen Kane of Italian cinema I pray I never have the misfortune to stumble upon the Smokey and the Bandit 3. This movie was so ridiculously laughable I can't help but wonder if all these glowing reviews were written by poor souls who had the misfortune of buying this piece of crap and are now trying to unload them on Ebay.

506,oalaa-25479,An Arthouse that Could've been way better,4,23 May 2021,"I don't really get the hype over this one denoting It's made by one of the best in this genre Dario Argento. It starts with a rainy gloomy atmosphere that soon develops to intense murdering scene that i think was the best thing in this movie, beside charming set decoration and unfailing color/lighting. The plot then lingered over everything once the protagonist step in the school which i totally forgot it was for ballet since there is only like one short dancing scene(or maybe two). Characterization is very weak and character seems like they have nothing to talk about other than a possible witchcraft conspiracies. Even worse, the plot is almost entirely explained over the first two thirds of the movie which makes zero interest in keeping me up till the end since you know where It's going I don't really want to talk about the writing because I rather view this in stylistic POV. But man, that slow pacing and repeated pattern of caught and murdered quickly starts to be annoying making you wait until boredom knocks you off. I heard that the remake is like 1 hour longer and better so maybe I'll give it a watch someday just for those extra ballet battements.",Suspiria
507,magnoitall,An atmospheric horror film with beautiful cinematography and a memorable score,7,11 June 2008,"The first thing you notice when starting Dario Argentno's 1977 cult horror film is the haunting music played over the opening credits. The main theme of the film (performed by Goblin, an Italian rock band) is, for me, one of the more memorable horror themes. Up there with the likes of Halloween and Jaws, it's simple yet effective at the same time. The plot of the film is also quite simple. It's about a 20 year old American dancer (Suzy Banyon played by Jessica Harper) who travels to Europe to enlist in a famous ballet academy. Once there, strange things start happening such as the murder of one of the girls on the night of Suzy's arrival. This leads Suzy on an expedition to uncover the mystery behind these strange occurrences which may even include the supernatural. The plot may seem unoriginal, and maybe it is, but whatever the script is lacking it is made up for by the beautiful cinematography. One of the last films to be shot on three-strip Technicolor, vivid colors are used in nearly every scene. This gives the film a look of its own and adds to the creepy atmosphere. Recommended to any horror fan and any doubters who say horror films can't be art.7.5 out of 10",Suspiria

The soundtrack is fitting and delivers the uneasiness and tension properly all throughout the film. The colours are striking and are used properly, with huge emphasis on the primary colours, especially red. The cinematography is superb, especially because Dario Argento challenged himself to make every shot different, causing the film to always deliver something you wouldn't quite expect.This concoction of glorious colours, expert cinematography, and a deep sense of dread in the soundtrack all make for an excellent watch which I am sure you would all want to experience.",Suspiria
509,kabeto,Is this Argento's best?,6,20 July 2003,"I have read about Argento being the master of horror movies, so I decided to watch one of his films. Suspiria is supposed to be his best work. I was dissapointed to find no gore at all (I did watch the full, uncut version), ridiculously helpless victims who choose to wait in a corner for their deaths, unnecessary secondary characters, and no sense in the story. I don't really care about the storyline if the movie is based on something else (comedy, sex, gore), but this has nothing. I will give Argento a second chance and watch Deep Red. If that doesn't do it for me...I am sorry. I will not add to mindless comments from ""real"" fans who claim this to be ""One of the scariest movies of all time"". I can give you ""One of the scariest movies of that year"", considering it was 1977 and violence and blood on film was frowned upon. But this movie is unlikely to convert me into an Argento fan. And to put some salt in the wound, I think The Blair Witch Project was better...and it probably cost around the same (ouch!)",Suspiria

In between the first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes nothing happens. This is why the movie is so lousy:1. People say the music is great. Its annoying. 2. People say it is gruesome. There are only maybe two gruesome senes. And they are not that bad. Check out the Evil Dead or Dawn of the Dead. Those are real Horror movies.3. There is no action except for the first 5 and last 5 minutes.I think the people who get scared by this movie are not used to Horror movies.

515,jimcapezio,BoRinG,1,11 November 2009,"This movie was soooooooooo boooooooring. It was so cerebral and annoying. The ambiance completely ruined the film. The music was pretty good but overdone and so loud anyone would be distracted from the BORING dialog which is imperative you pay attention to in order to understand what is going on. The decoration of the interior sets was awesome in a gaudy 1970's sort of way. But, like the music, it was a huge distraction from the arduous task of having to give 100% attention to a movie about NOTHING while scary music plays and people babble nonsense, only because it looks like they are saying that for the Italian to English overdub.There is one cheesy murder scene about 15 minutes into the film, then 60+ minutes of atrocious and vacuous banter, and then another retarded cheesy gore scene...and then credits, which to me was the climax (yay... it's finally over).Something I found funny: About 40 minutes into the film, a ballet dancer (the main character)passes out...while standing on her toes!!! Like, staggering around looking all jacked up and rolling her eyes back in her head...but she remains on her tippy-toes the whole time and then just passes out and hits the deck. dUH!!! I think someone on the verge of unconsciousness would flatten her feet out first before passing out. If you want revenge on someone, give them this movie for Christmas and watch it with them, giving commentary about how much you love ""Goblin"", the Italian 1970's progressive rock band that provided the over-featured soundtrack. I am no movie critic, but trust me...this is the most boring crap I have ever forced myself to sit through. It was just BAD. HORRIBLE.",Suspiria

It then cuts to the girl who ran away and goes through her death sequence. Afterwards the girl arrives at the school the next day.

It all leads up to the point at which the American girl decides to see where the staff goes at night, Once she finds the secret out she kills the mastermind and leaves the school, which erupts into flames.If you're looking for a horror movie to scare the crap out of you...don't look here. This is more of those movies that create suspense to get it's point across. If you get into the atmosphere and mystery of the movie, you will find a very enjoyable experience, but if you want your gore, and people popping out from nowhere, look somewhere else. This movie fits in the suspense genre more than horror. The ending is predictable and pretty badly done. Overall it's pretty good, but considering the crap that Hollywood is producing, I'd like to see something like this done a bit better and more often.",Suspiria
517,fargond,Suspiria is an average film,5,1 January 2008,"I found the film a rather run of the mill horror film. Compared to a film like Ôdishon, Suspiria is little more than a somewhat spooky witch tale. I did not find the directing very compelling and thought that the movie was somewhat garbled in its plot. It really rather reminded me of the films I saw as a kid in which you waited with baited breath (knowing what was going to happen) for somebody to jump out from behind a door.I believe that William Castle had some films about witches that were just as loud, not as much Technicolor perhaps, but, probably as effective. All and all I would call this a very average film. I know that this is counter to the general reviews and that is what scares me.",Suspiria
518,astrozombiex,So bad that it makes me angry...,1,24 August 2002,"Like many others, I had been turned on to this movie by the numerous glowing reviews out there (and I had read lots of reviews of this thing). So I was really psyched to find it used on DVD one day. I bought it sight unseen and damnit if I didn't feel really ripped off.  It lacked dramatic tension, ambiance, and even the pop-up scares and gore that even mediocre horror has. Notice that even the positive reviews mentioned that it lacked in plot and didn't directly scare the viewer, but the visuals and atmosphere more than made up for that. In truth it's all bad. Many horror fans would agree that you can forgo an air-tight plot if other things keep the film moving, but Suspiria has very little going for it. And has anyone stopped to think that if Argento succeeded in creating a rich, haunting atmosphere, then why shouldn't the movie be scary?Even with an art house lens, it's amateurish. I give it points for good sets and costumes. Beyond that, many of the scenes are uninteresting (visually AND story-wise) and totally unrelated to each other, i.e it doesn't make sense and it's paced badly! Its witch mythology is nonsensical, and there is no story motivation. Why does a devious underground witches' coven open a dance school? And why do they ritualistically drug one oblivious dancer and not the others? What's the point of the maggots? Why is a shiny spoon supposed to be scary? Too many nagging questions. Somehow there is little action, story, or character development in the numerous scenes of this film. Suspiria takes itself way to seriously to get past these holes, or even make the movie fun or interesting. Plus, the ""chilling"" light effects are literally reminiscent of the comic book murder scenes in Creepshow (go Adrienne!). `Creative and unique' my ass! I found the camera work dull and lacking in intensity. Even cheesy, no-budget Evil Dead (which we all love of course) had creative/unusual cinematography. Suspiria's also not very gory (was that magenta Tempra paint?) which I can appreciate, except that the few killing scenes are just lame and go on too long. The meandering killers seem pretty bored and lackadaisical, actually making it seem unbelievable that the victims are so scared. Horror should be about intensity and passion, and Suspiria is all wrong.If you like creepiness with interesting shots/lighting with slow development and not too much blood, try Repulsion or even Alien.  There are a million creepier, more atmospheric, and more interesting films just in the sub genre of B-horror. Good old Night of the Living Dead! To recap: story, pacing, and visuals are a bust and there isn't gore to hold the attention of splatter fans. I won't even mention the beloved soundtrack. Okay, I will. It was generally inappropriate for the scenes and the band regularly struck disruptive power chords, hissed and screeched when absolutely nothing was happening. Why?! I forced myself to watch it again the next day to prove that I hadn't wasted my money. I returned it that afternoon.",Suspiria

Sure, the final minutes in the basement are OK, but there's no excuse for the tortoise film making up until that moment.And what's the deal with the music. They build up suspense in all the wrong places.

(Rhyming sophisticated)",3,22 July 2009,"I finally got this movie via Netflix after having missed my chance to see it for the first time on a big screen.Wow.I realize that older movies are often considered 'tame' by today's standards, but this movie is (imho) really, very boring.Not very much happens. Only one or two graphic deaths -- and this is supposed to be a horror movie, after all.The cinematography and use of color is beautiful, but, um, where's the chopped beef? About that soundtrack. Yeah, it's scary. Easily more frightening than anything depicted on screen. It bothered me to be honest, and it reminded me of other movies like Legend and Near Dark where the entire soundtrack is done by a single band/artist, however, in this case I found it just pretty annoying. If you watched this movie muted, it would absolutely put you to sleep. Alternately, listening to the movie with no picture might remind you of bad haunted house effect loops.I'm sure i'm in the minority of people who did not LOVE this movie, but, for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, don't get your hopes up too high.It pales by comparison to Carrie from a year previous.",Suspiria
521,DonnieJ77,"If you like horror movies with either intense psychological or gory scares, avoid this movie",1,9 September 2010,"I forced myself to finish this movie because most of the reviews on this site were very positive, but the stupidity of the script, the bad acting, and the slowness of the plot made it almost unbearable.If you like horror movies with either intense psychological or gory scares (e.g. The Others, The Shinning, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Hostel, Saw), I wouldn't recommend this movie.My only positive comments are the aesthetically pleasing settings and the main musical theme, which is not bad for a 1970s movie (although it's heavily overused to the point of becoming an annoyance).In my opinion this movie has almost no entertainment value and is a waste of time. I was compelled to write this review, since most of the other reviews are positive.

522,thequeengorgo,A Provocative Atmosphere,8,22 March 2009,"As a self-proclaimed horror connoisseur, this movie left me in awe. The plot is retrenched by the, at times, obnoxious music, and opulent scenery. But it is my opinion, that a sturdy plot isn't needed to make this film worthwhile. The scenes are decadently enhanced by artificial colored lights and an unsettling orchestration that is by far the most chilling soundtrack I've heard in a horror movie. The acting was mediocre, but I feel like the amateur and sometimes humorous portrayals, added a certain depth and feel that otherwise wouldn't have worked. The cinematography is brilliant. At times I felt as though I was looking at an ""I Spy"" book. There was always something more to look at, but not so much that it was impossible to catch. All of this combined with the rich Italian architecture, make for a seriously thought-provoking film. I couldn't shake the scenes for weeks later. Though the plot didn't add up, I was unable to stop myself from feeling an unusual sort of fear. It's all the more frightening because I honestly did not know what to be afraid of. If you're a stickler for fine-tuned films, then I would not recommend this. But if you're like me and prefer films for their atmosphere and thought inducing visualization, Suspiria will more than boggle your mind.",Suspiria
523,Lynchpin,The ultimate twisted fairy-tale,10,26 July 2005,"Whilst directors like George A Romero, Wes Craven and David Cronenberg were addressing and creating an American nightmare through the horror medium, Dario Argento was doing a similar thing in Europe. It was only natural after his four very successful murder mystery films that Argento would make a full blown entry into the world of horror and the supernatural. ""Deep Red"", although ostensibly a murder mystery had shown Argento's respect and consideration of the codes of the horror genre and with it's very violent death scenes the way was paved. Argento entered a new phase in his career.""Suspiria"" is totally and completely a horror film. A roller coaster ride of fear and terror from start to finish. But a horror film with a particularly European sensibility and outlook. From the opening credits sequence the weird and wonderful primal percussion of the Goblin soundtrack assaults the senses. A soundtrack so original and perfect for the film that it would become very influential within the field. The feeling of uneasiness is with you right from the outset and it never entirely leaves you. Even mundane things like an airport terminal and electronic sliding doors are given a surreal and odd quality. Once outside the airport our heroine Suzy Banyon, played with wide-eyed innocent by Jessica Harper is almost knocked off her feet by the wind and rain, the very elements themselves acting as portents of the brutal violence to come. Through seemingly innocuous and random things such as gushing rivers and a taxi journey Argento has a built an atmosphere of intense dread and fear. Set in the heart of the black forest of Germany Argento plays on aspects of folk lore in much the same way as his US contemporaries were playing on American myths. A Hansel and Gretel like horror that profoundly disturbs due to its child-like nature and connotations. Argento is playing with deep rooted fears within us all and the film's Germanic setting gives it a strange surreal realism, if such a thing can be. But Argento also plays close attention to generic conventions. And shows a surprisingly good understanding of them in what is really his first full horror movie. Like most affective horror movies it is set almost entirely in one location, in this case a very creepy and atmospheric dance school. There are lots of eerie night time sequences and lots of supernatural babble. But where Argento differs from the comfortable expectations of the horror genre is in his technical approach to this film. Argento employed the services of the one of the last Technicolor cameras and the result is astonishing as Argento creates a curious visual palette. He splashes lurid and odd colours into almost every scene. Greens, reds and blues are used to startling effect and grips the audience in the claws of unease that never let up. The narrative structure is also quite strong, which is a surprise for an Argento production. This was the first film in a mooted trilogy detailing the present day incarnations of the mythical Three Mothers. Three figures of ancient evil still alive and functioning. In ""Suspiria"" we have the Mother of Sighs and her coven of witches. But these things really are superfluous and play second fiddle to Argento's main interest, which is creating unforgettably ways to kill of his cast. The opening fifteen minutes of the movie are true genius.A horror movie can provide many functions, but its most important one is to scare the hell out of the viewer. If a horror movie doesn't get some reaction from you, then it has certainly failed. In this context ""Suspiria"" is easily one of the greatest horror movies. The atmosphere is heavily laden and a great deal of the credit must go to Italian progressive rock band Goblin, who produce a wondrous score. But it is essential to watch this movie in the correct manner, with the lights off and the surround sound on high. In these conditions be prepared for a truly awesome and terrifying spectacle",Suspiria

I'm about 1 hour and 15 minutes into this film and determined to finish it... but I'm not sure I have that much patience. The acting is some of the worst I've ever seen. The reveals are mechanical and awkward. The 'artistic' touches -- I assume -- consist of bad amateur theater lighting in garish reds and greens... and some of the worst arbitrarily framed camera shots I've ever seen. The blood looks like watery ketchup. The soundtrack -- oh, God, don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Did someone have a nephew with a death-metal garage band that desperately needed work? It comes on full volume out of nowhere and assaults your ears until you want to mute the TV. The times is comes in -- and cuts out -- are inexplicable. This may be picky, but we never see the main character -- who is supposed to already be an accomplished dancer, only at the academy where the story takes place to hone her craft -- DANCE. Every time we see her in a lesson, she's hanging out by the barre. Couldn't they have at least stuck in a body double? Did I mention the acting? Excreable. Shuddersome. Painful to the Nth degree.

How can something so bad have such good reviews and a total score of 7,4 ?Just some points:Acting: Mediocre at best, with some moments of the most wooden performance I have seen in my life. No, scratch that - the most ""let's pretend very hard that whatever is happening is scary"" acting I have seen in my life.Storyline: My 13-year-old daughter writes more convincing stories than this. Come on, people, something like this is supposed to be a masterpiece of art? According to some reviewers, yes... But the story is so obvious and simple, I was able to tell the ending after first fifteen minutes into the movie. Should that be a plus in any movie? I do not think so.Symbolism and surrealism: Please tell me, where is any originality in it? This movie was shot in 1977 for god's sake!!! Anything shown here was derived from other work, and other movies. And, what's probably more important, it is so far-fetched it feels simply showy and nothing else.Music: The most pretentious part of all. Some said the score was the strongest part of the film. For me it was just trying to insert ""tension"" and ""fear"" in places the picture failed to do it. Music was artificial and forced to the point I had to mute the TV in some places in order to be able to continue watching the film.Gory parts: Well, for 1977 they are not that bad. Make-up is decent, dead people look dead, although colors are overdone (which is probably intended).Scare factor: None whatsoever. Sorry. Forget it. Not for me.OVERALL: Boring..... what else? .....boring..... and boring plus the worst film music I have ever heard.For me 1 of 10.",Suspiria
527,jeanpaul984,"Great Visuals, Wonderful Set Design, Poor Movie",9,3 September 2003,"Dario Argento's Suspiria is a movie that definetely attracts the viewer by its beautiful display of colors and camera work. The shot in which we see a castle reflected on the water, giving the illusion of a real building is really ingenious. We also see amazing design in the interiors with a lot of geometrical compositions, that gives you the impression that this film has been made by someone sensitive to visual art. The use of blue and red are well chosen in order to create a visual feast for the spectator. However, the movie is not an exact demonstration of what smart, creative storytelling can be. It is a poor movie that after being watched, leaves the sensation of wasted time. Dialogue is completely void and doesn't build any of the characters. There is no depth to it and even as an entertaining horror movie fails for its lack of content and meaning. Dario Argento can be a genious in filmmaking but he fails mostly to create plots that are complex and characters that are 3 dimensional. I really had hopes for this film , since I had heard really good comments about it, and it was my first Argento film that I could rent for free at the public library. I wish this film would have been better; it could have been a masterpiece...My rating 5/10 1- Good Visuals 2- Good Set Design 3- Good Cinematography 4- Fair Soundtrack 5- Dario Argento",Suspiria

The rest of it I did not enjoy even as you do with some cheesy horror B-movies of yore.Writing, decorations, FX and most of the acting are bad. The school's interiors look like they are made out of plywood with flat textures drawn on them, and decorations are cheap or kitsch. Death and struggle scenes are ridiculously cheesy with all the bright red gouache or whatever that was used for blood. Lines like ""I'm blind, not deaf"" and the very academic Prof. Milius' introduction into the nature of witchcraft make up most of the dialogue. The final scene surprised me because none of the witches melted. And what's with the room where someone left a lot of wire? Any reputed dancing school ran by a coven has to have one?I don't get it how you can release something like this knowing that Rosemary's baby or any of Hitchcock movies exist, and still be serious.",Suspiria

Is that scene done in 48 fps? The depth is flawless with the trees. While the movie has some interesting ideas to it, it just doesn't pull off what its trying to.

532,Dbeezine9_,Beautiful Technicolor Nightmare (minor spoiler),9,6 October 2004,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE. But this film must be viewed from a proper perspective to be appreciated. It is not a film that concerns itself with realism, dialogue or even a particularly cohesive storyline. It instead relies on the emotions that it evokes through color and sound. Much like our dreams, backgrounds and timelines shift.The film has a lot of expressionist tones to it and draws the viewer into its non-reality. The people that wrote bad reviews on this site were citing inconsistencies and irregularities in the story. They just don't get it. We all know that hands don't really appear out of nowhere to pull someone through a third story window. A prime example of Argento's avoidance of reality is when Suzy spills her wine down the bathroom sink. It doesn't look like wine....but it doesn't look like blood either. It looks like red fluorescent paint.This is not due to bad film making; it reinforces the artificiality of the world Suzy has immersed herself in. We are so concerned with the primary action, like the stabbing scene, we don't even notice that the victim (who was in an apartment room) is now being stabbed against a steel grating. Argento's use of color further solidifies his expressionist style. His colors are coordinated in a psychological manner. The scenes are drenched in color which is not only artificial, but helps disturb the viewer's desire for reason. Even something as innocuous as a toilet becomes evil when saturated in blood-red hues.If taken at face value, Suspiria is an OK horror movie. But because of its hallucinatory nature, along with an incredible and relentless soundtrack, it is truly something special. It is a fairytale like Argento describes. But it is also takes place in the dreamworld, which is why Suzy approaches everything very wide-eyed instead of running from the school from the beginning.This is a film that appreciates with repeated viewings. The color palate and the set designs alone make this film worthwhile. The star of the movie is the Dance Academy itself. I am heartbroken that a remake is in the works. This may be the scariest aspect of this film. Why can't anybody ever walk away from something special?? Odds are that it will be an overblown abomination, much like what befell the classic ""The Haunting."" I truly hope that Suspiria does not become ""Hollywoodized"" and mar the beauty and legacy of the original.",Suspiria

The film presents a totally authentic script, inside a very complex theme. The plot does not tell ... It portrays the existence and practice of occultism, surrounded by groups skeptical or ignorant of the subject. There was a dark, tense and mysterious atmosphere from beginning to end. The setting (dance academy) chosen for the construction of the plot was the grand balcony, for me. This guaranteed several alternatives of characters, and further enhance the originality of the film. Jessica Harper and the rest of the cast provided excellent interpretations of the suggested roles. The sound effects contributed too much, fueling the suspense of each scene and increasing the viewer's perspective. Anyway, this is a work to never be forgotten.

Secondly, thanks to all the pretentious ""film buffs"" that have listed ""Suspiria"" in any top 100 list, I appreciate that this is your opinion but you are wrong. This movie comes close to one of the worst I have ever sat through, one with little or no redeeming features.Argento's much acclaimed use of colour is pointless and clumsy, the soundtrack distracts the viewer from any potential suspense and his choice of effects is poor at best. An example of this is the overly graphic stabbing scene, Hitchcock taught us years earlier that you don't need to show what the mind can create for itself. Also why even use the chubby bat prop when the mere suggestion of a bat would have been more frightening. The script is poor and the plot line thin, if this movie had used a sense of irony it would still be bad but could have been funny.In conclusion, I would advise any movie lover to avoid ""Suspiria"" as you would any Steven Seagal film, your time will be better spent elsewhere.Here are some alternative titles you should try:The Shining - Stanley Kubrick 1980 The Vanishing - George Sluizer 1988Ringu - Hideo Nakata 1998 Psycho - Alfred Hitchcock 1960 Rosemary's Baby - Roman Polanski 1968That is all.",Suspiria

The acting was awful, but I can overlook this as the acting in most of Argento's films is poor. What can't be overlooked is the terrible story and lack of suspense.Fans of this will rave about the cinematography but style of substance doesn't make this anymore entertaining. Flashing different coloured lights in the background doesn't make it ground breaking. I can't find any redeeming quality's in the film and I only paid a very small amount for it.

That coupled with the eerie soundtrack makes for a terror and dread inducing horror movie like no other. The suspense is very subtle, unlike most of the horror movies today which love to throw everything at the viewer.Some of the more memorable scenes were the blind man walking home through the square and the last victim trying to escape from her assailant, an extremely suspenseful chase in my opinion.Two thumbs up for Dario Argento and props to the great music from 'The Goblins'.",Suspiria
